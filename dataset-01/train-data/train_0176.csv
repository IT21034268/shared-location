3,"Very nice mouse, but for gamers only.","Being Logitech's most expensive mouse, you would expect this to be *the* mouse to get, with all the shortcut buttons and perfect smoothness/weight of a flagship mouse. But alas this is a GAMER'S mouse, and is not particularly suitable for normal users.Pros: Solid feeling design, nice click, smooth movement from included teflon bottom pads, positive feeling scroll wheel. Price was excellent ($67- $50 mir).Cons: Rechargable battery lasts only 1-2 days on a single charge (thats why there are two batteries included, so you can swap them out). The weight of the mouse is also on the light side as well. I was told this is because gamers prefer a lighter mouse. Do they have sticks for arms or something? A normal mouse is hardly heavy or fatigue inducing, even with the fastest shooter games. I guess I'm just used to the hefty microsoft wireless units."
2,Battery Life is Horrible,"The mouse itself is a great idea, but the battery life is horrible. I guess that is why you receive two batteries with this mouse; they resemble cheap cordless phone batteries.I work from home, and can tell you the battery will not last through half a day of continuous use. I find myself having to switch batteries at the worst possible moments. - Sure it has a battery indicator, but it is covered by the palm of your hand.So for what I paid, the previous Logitech MX Laser is a much better deal. The battery life on that mouse lasts almost 3 times as long as the two combined which come with the G7."
2,"Precision or not, battery kills the deal",I have to switch batteries once every 1.5 days. I don't play any game so I have no idea why it is draining the battery that hard. Wonder how long the included battery would last. It is definitely not a GREEN mouse from that perspective.
4,Wireless gaming mouse,"Bought this so that I could get the performance of my G5 without the cord.Performance and response seems identical to the G5. The batteries last for about 6 hours of Call Of Duty 4 online. Swapping out the batteries is fast.The only complaint is the the setpoint software is a little quirky. If the mouse is not powered on when the system starts then the Setpoint software doesn't recognize it. You have to stop and restart the Setpoint software to get the advanced functions to work (again, only if the mouse wasn't powered on when the system was booted, other that that it's fine). Having the the docking station connected will sometimes cause my system to hang at boot (ASUS Maximus Formula X38). Disabling Legacy USB support in the BIOS solved the boot problem, so not a big deal. Overall I think it's a great mouse since it performs the same as the G5 and it looses the cord. I would have rated it 5 stars if it wasn't for the Setpoint software issues with this mouse."
2,Batteries WILL die on you!,"The first few months this mouse was great, but after a year, the tiny batteries have become annoyingly weak. I have another Logitech cordless I have owned for THREE YEARS that uses AA batteries, and I'm not joking, I have replaced those batteries ONCE. These little rechargeable cards with the G7 are now lasting maybe 2 hours at a time.I'm also having problems keeping the mouse connected. At least once a day, it will just lose communication with Windows and I have to unplug the cordless adapter, count to 10, and plug back in so Windows will recognize the device.... not worth the $60-$70 price tag imo."
2,Short Battery life,"The mouse itself works fine and I don't have problems with range as I had with my last cordless mouse. However the battery will last only one or two days. Logitech states that 8 hioours of use is the expected life. It's easy enough to swap the batteries back and forth, but still a small hassle. Most people should opt for a less power hungry mouse."
2,Logitech should be better,"Maybe my expectations are just too high, but I've come to expect a lot from Logitech products. They've been great in the past. Maybe it's just this particular product. I've read some complaints about the short battery life. Very true and disappointing considering it's made to be a gaming mouse. And for several months I've been having issues with bad buttons. Sometimes when I click on windows, they stay inactive. I've found that it has something to do with the scroll button sticking. If I wiggle it a bit, it seems to relieve the problem for a little and allows me to select windows again. I'll probably still try another Logitech, but I was disappointed with this particular one"
2,Great feel.. great weight.. fast.. but defective...,This mouse is all the positives that you've read. It is a GREAT mouse IF you get one that isn't defective. I purchased mine in August/September and within a month it started acting up (on multiple machines). The cursor would freeze for a period of 60-90 seconds - 3 to 4 times a hour. It didn't matter if I had a freshly charged battery in there or not. (and it's not near any other wireless sources so it's not a matter of interference and all drivers/setpoint are current).I called Logitech's customer support and since this mouse is no longer manufactured (so watch out if you're purchasing one after the date on this post) they offered me a wireless MX Revolution or a wired G9. (I took the G9 and will review that later).So while the mouse is good there are issues with it - Logitech's CS is superb. Although I'll swear to that AFTER I get the new mouse :)
3,"Good mouse, good techonology, but lacks quality","PROS:So the G7 is a solid mouse technology wise with its 2000 dpi sensor. The polyurethane feet really does help the mouse slide around easier. I also like the weight, it is fairly light for a cordless mouse. The battery packs don't weigh all that much compared to two AA batteries.CONS:I don't like how there's no forward button, only a back button for the thumb. Also, Logitech has greatly reduced their quality in the G7. I really don't like the all plastic construction, it seems really cheap. The cheap feel doesn't justify the premium price. I really liked the soft touch, rubber like grip that the MX510 mouse had. I wish this mouse had it too.OVERALL, if you gave me the choice of a MX510 or a G7. I would go with an MX510 without giving it a second thought. The cheap feel and lack of the forward/scroll buttons is enough for me to go for a better feeling mouse like the MX510 or MX518."
1,Wifi Interference - Loses Connection,I have this mouse for over an year and it always had issues with disconnection problems. I talked to logitech and they said that they will send me a replacement and I have chosen Performance MX.This mouse was taken out from logitech and brought back after couple of months. The issue I have is also the top one is their forums. The customer care does not know if the problem has been rectified after a couple of versions of this mouse.its a good mouse with swappable batteries which i like a lot. Batteries do no last more than a week.Buy it and see if this works for you. you can always get a replacement with a warranty of 3 years.
3,Good but has a classic problem,"I got this product in at least two years ago. In the beginning it works very well, fast and accurate. The battery is running out very fast. But it does not bother me because I am not a big game guy.After one year or so, I found that the left click button sometimes behaved as a double click when I actually pressed once. I kept using it until I found it turned to be a big headache. Then I googled and found this was a big and classic problem with this mouse. A lot of people experience this 'double/single' click problem.I called logitech and exchanged to a new one ( free with warranty). The new one had been used for around 6 months and never caught me any problem yet.Overall, it is a very good mouse if without that big headache."
4,Best Wireless Gaming Mouse,"This is the best wireless gaming mouse I have used. You cannot tell this apart from a wired mouse as far as connectivity is concerned. My only complaint is that you have to swap out the batteries too often. However, since it comes with two you can always have one charged and ready to pop in. It only takes 10 seconds to slide one out of the mouse and snap a new one in."
2,Bad Battery and No Support from Logitech,This mouse comes with two batteries. Logitech probably realized the relative short battery life and compensated by supplying an extra battery to swap out if the first starts to fade. This works if the second battery is good. Not in the one I purchased. One battery simply won't charge. I contacted Logitech and requested a replacement battery (it's under warranty -whatever good that does). They told me to contact the retailer -for a replacement battery?!? No help there:Pack up the mouse and mail it back to the seller (Amazon in my case) and have them send me a replacement mouse?!? A bit of overkill isn't it? I just need a battery. Logitech will not put a battery in the mail and send it to me. Period!
3,Just okay...,"I purchased this mouse to replace another older Logitech MX-700 cordless and I have to say that I'm not overly impressed. While being able to swap batteries on the fly is great, I've noticed a few issues that I did not experience with my other cordless. First of all, the overall pointer movement across the screen is quite jerky at times which is very annoying. Additionally, while battery life is very good for general mousing, it depletes much more rapidly during moderate gaming. Not a bad mouse, but for the money, it's not really that much better than my old MX-700."
4,Best mouse I've used BUT....,"This is the best mouse I've ever had. Wireless is perfect, ergonomics is good, and has lot of features BUT Logitech doesn't sell replacement batteries."
5,Lag is very important to me.,"I selected this mouse because of its reputation for zero lag. I just received it 10 minutes ago and the precision and performance is incredible. I've been a computer buff for 15 years and think of the mouse as an extension of my arm. So, I did not want the slightest bit of lag. When I say lag, I mean any noticeable lag at allll. I can tell you that the G7 does not have any lag. It is a wired mouse without the wire. I have not tested it long enough to comment on the battery. This is the only mouse to have. No reason to spend 30 dollars when you can spend 68 and get a ferrari.Enjoy."
4,Battery life is as advertized..... be aware,"When they say battery life is 2 to 3 days, you better believe them. Logitech does give two batteries so you can swap them out. It is a little annoying to have them die so quick especially if you are in a middle of a game.Charging the battery can also be an issue because the charger draws power off USB. If your PC is off, you can't charge the battery.Aside from the short battery life between charges, this mouse is excellent."
1,G-l lasts at most 1 year then dies!,SO I got it and it was good for a year then it died. RMA i get a DOA RMA again 2 months later dead now I'm trying to get a refund so i can get the G5 (much better). Save money and get a G5.
4,Not Bad but could be better,"I've had the G7 for about 3 months now and my thoughts are:PROS:- Nice form factor. It fits in the hand really well. There's a good weight to it so it flows quite smoothly on my corepad- Adjustible DPI on the fly. This is great in FPS games like BF2 when you want to switch really quickly- Interchangable battery system. It's nice to be able to switch out the battery when you're low so you're not stuck recharging your mouse in a dock when you forget to recharge- Cool little battery indicator on the mouse. Lets you view your charge level at a glance.CONS:- BATTERY LIFE!!! OMG, these last maybe 2 days at the best with light use. If you play some BF2, forget it, you're changing the batteries every day if not more often. Even my MX1000 would last almost a week even with heavy usage- Only one side button. Come on...how hard would it have been to put two buttons there like every other mouse?Overall though it's one of the best cordless mice out there even with the flaws."
2,Hello Microsoft..again,"Mouse worked great for 1 month. Then would freeze for 5-20 seconds. Logitec said it was magnetic or wifi disruption dropping the signal. I turned off my wifi and cordless phone with no luck. Please do your research on any tech site. Same problem abounds more times than not. If this issue was fixed I would give it 4 stars, now its an expensive paperweight."
2,Terrible gaming mouse,Do not buy if you have other wireless or cordless items. The mouse stops working because of interference and the battery life sucks. It can really get frustrating during the middle of a important situation and your battery dies/loses connection.
1,Worst POS I've ever bought,"this is the worst POS I've ever bought. It stops working randomly and might work for awhile, then the damn thing stops responding again. Over and over and over. I finally threw it at the floor as hard as I could. I feel better and I even think the mouse might work better...if I glued it back together. Spare yourself and DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP.It's so bad, I've gone back to a wired mouse....yes it was that bad."
2,"Horrible Batteries, if one lasts a day you are doing well.",The batteries were completely over looked by Logitech. The mouse might function well but I can not get the batteries to last more then a day. I will not buy another G7.
3,"If its life is more than one year, it can get a 4.5","but it is dead after one year of usage. When it is alive, it performed well and no complain for the speed and sensitivity."
3,Battery Life Problems,"The batteries take longer to charge than to discharge, so heavy gaming sessions leave you with two exhausted batteries.Since the battery charger is USB connected, the battery charges only when the machine is on."
2,"Great Mouse, Bad Support","Awesome mouse. Use it with my laptop to both work and play a couple of MRPG's. However, during one of my extensive travels, I lost one of the batteries. When I called Logitech's store to buy a replacement battery, the rep said I had to call the tech support, since they have to be processed as warranty replacements. Upon calling the tech support I was unpleasantly surprised that there is no way to obtain a replacement battery anymore. I was offered a new mouse at half of MSRP price, but declined the offer. So while the product itself is great, the battery life is fantastic (for a rechargable battery), the support side... well, sux!"
2,LogiTech's Rare Blunder,I bought this controller because it was on sale for $45.00 and for THAT price it is an acceptable mouse. It is comfortable and does what I as a web surfer need for it to do. HOWEVER the freaking battery issue is B.S. Changing the battery at least once a day is pain especially if the dead battery doesn't get placed back in the charger correctly and leaves you hanging when it is needed. I saw all the complaints about this before I bought this mouse and thought to myself that changing the battery often would be no big deal. I'm here to tell you - IT GETS OLD IN A HURRY. Bottom line is LogiTech is capable of much better products than this and you would be better off avoiding this mouse at any price.
1,wast of money,"I bought this Laser mouse because I wanted to try and go the wireless mouse rout, what a big mistake, the mouse either (in a program) moves real fast or it moves real slow and the control buttons on the mouse are limited as to mouse speed, and the rechargeable batteries don't retain there charge very long about a day and a half and the recharge bay only works when the computer is on. I am going to wait a long time before I revisit the idea of a cordless mouse. Do your self a favor and stay with a corded mouse."
4,Great Mouse but too expensive and poor battery,I love this mouse but the surprising thing is that it has been the same price for the last year. My old wireless mouse had AA batteries and I changed them once every 3 months. I'm shocked at what pathetic batteries it comes with. I still would recommend it though as it is a great mouse.
2,Battery life probs,"This is a great mouse when you first get it. Lightweight, super precise, customizable buttons, egronomic, good looking. But when used regularly for long periods, battery life suddenly goes into the toilet. That is, you end up swapping batts seriously every 10-20 minutes. This started after about 6 months. Super disappointing. Went back to the trusty MX700. G7 is now collecting dust, both batteries dead. Along with my heart."
2,Very poor battery life!,"I have been using a Microsoft mouse, that used standard AA batteries for years. I got sick of having to hunt down new batteries 2-3 times a YEAR. I purchased this mouse because of its rechargeable battery. However, I am very disappointed with its battery life. I have had the mouse for few months now, the first month, I had to swap the battery ONCE A DAY, annoying, but not too bad, I would have assumed that a Li-Ion battery would last longer than AA batteries, I cant believe it has to be swapped DAILY. The biggest problem is that every time you recharge a battery, it reduces its life, I knew this from the beginning and expected the batteries to last at least a year or two, however I am already am finding that I am swapping the batteries about twice a day. At this rate, I will probably be swapping the batteries hourly by the end of the year. I highly recommend going for a mouse that uses standard batteries."
3,"Great mouse, poor batteries","I bought this mouse for its shape, similar to my beloved but discontinued MX1000. Even though I don't use the mouse for gaming, I need to swap the batteries at least once a day. That isn't all - the battery life indicator almost always shows three green bars (fully charged), occasionally two bars, then goes straight to dead without warning. This is with the charger in normal, not boost, mode. I'm glad to see that spare batteries are now available, it doesn't hurt to have them around.The mouse feel, the perfect glide, the light-touch buttons - all deserve 5 stars."
5,Amazed!,I have accidentally dropped my G7 many times on the floor due to tight operating room. It is rugged! I just pop the battery back in and keep operating.
5,Excellent,"I have been using this mouse for 3 years now, and it has been excellent. I just purchased a second set of batteries, and I'm getting ready to purchase another G7. So I highly recommend this product."
3,Poor battery life,"This is a good mouse, but the battery life is pathetic - I have to change the battery every few hours. As the batteries get older they wil hold even less charge, so I expect to be replacing this expensive item within a year."
2,Great... While it lasts,"I bought this mouse and used it for about a month. Then whenever I started up my computer, the cursor would not move...Cheaply made.I'd recommend the new wireless MX (if you don't mind paying a little extra)"
1,Excellent ... while it works.,"Same problem here. The mouse stop working after some months and Logitech support is useless.It was great while it worked though, maybe the best i tried after the apple trackpad.I've tried all kind of things to make it work again but i couldn't; now i'm considering buying a new set of batteries.... who knows."
3,nice mouse,This was a nice mouse. Don't use it anymore. The batteries kepy wearing out. Came with a charger unit built into the receiver. Very fast and accurate. Technology keeps evolving andwe must keep up.
3,Not too shabby,"I recently bought this mouse for my gamer boyfriend and it has some cool features on it- even includes some software for your computer. However, we have had some problems where it randomly stops working even though the battery is charged. It starts back up after a while though, so it could be worse. The adjustable mouse speed and little charging station are great features."
4,Perfect for 1 year,"Great precision. Great transmission range. Great transmission continuity... until now.I had this mouse for about one year. Then the batteries started to run out about once a day. I use it as my work mouse. So, it's used for about 6-8 hours a day. So, pretty good performance really. When I first bought it the batteries would last about 4-5 days.But, then the mouse just stopped transmitting for about 10 seconds every few minutes. Annoying to say the least. I tried moving the receiver 5 inches from the mouse. No good. I had to retire it.It's pretty expensive to replace every year. But, I think I might just because it works so much better than any other wireless mouse."
5,Amazing,"This mouse is amazing. Most complaints with wireless mice are about the batteries, or about lag, but with the G7, neither is a problem. The hot-swappable batteries take less than 5 seconds to switch, there is no lag, the on-the-fly DPI switch is very useful for gaming and the tilt wheel is great for internet browsing. I can't stand corded mice so this is a perfect mouse for me. I love the Logitech comfort grip and my only complaint is the non-rubberized grip which has been added in newer versions. It gets dirty but the dirt is easily wiped off. The G7 is a great mouse for gamers, but a little expensive for anyone not interested in gaming."
2,Great Mouse but very poor battery life,"I agree with positive reviewers concerning the excellent precision and smooth performance of the G7, but if you spend a decent amount of time on the computer daily you will hate this mouse and Logitech. What will happen is that you will quickly tire of having to swap to the spare battery every day or every other day. What's worse is that you will soon realize that the G7's batteries are propriety and there's nothing you can do about it (i.e. buying more powerful batteries) short of returning the mouse. How Logitech can sell a premium mouse with no battery life is beyond me. I guess that's why they give you the spare battery that is always charged. That, however, is just a band aid covering a power hungry design that is a great annoyance."
5,Amazing mouse,"This is the single best mouse that I have ever used. The battery life is about a day, which is a very good life span for a rechargable mouse, and when it dies, i simply swap it out for the other one. I have used many other mice, and this one is the most comftorble to hold, and is nearly frictionless. The wireless range is great. I can be sitting on my bed and controlling my computer about ten feet away, which is great for watching movies. I would reccommend this mouse to any computer user, not just gamers."
4,Oh What a Mouse,"I've been using this mouse for several weeks. It's such a delight to sit down to this comfortable, stylish mouse. Not only does it look good, it works great. I have to change the battery every day or so. It would be nice if that weren't the case. However, there were two in the box and it's not a big deal to swap them. I even got it done in the middle of a game without getting killed (and I was being attacked).Great Mouse, I would buy it again in a heartbeat. Logitech always does it right."
4,Battery Issue,"I have a MX1000 but wanted more control at high resolution so I purchased the G7:1. I put the G7 on the lowest DPI rate for working with Autocad/Viso/PhotoShop then switch it to the highest for normal use.Works Great!2. I miss the feel of the MX1000, the buttons, the grip, low profile wheel.3. I miss the long battery life of the MX1000, I have to change the G7 batteries twice a day, no big deal but I wish I could make it a full day on one battery pack.Logitech would get a BIG 10 on an MX1000/G7 Cross, the resolution switching of the G7 + battery swappable + docking charger + USB RF doggle with the body and features of the MX1000!"
5,Fabulous,You can't go wrong with this mouse. I was using it in under five minutesafter opening the package. My son uses one for gaming and I use mine for general PC operation. I will be buying a third one for work.Highly recommended.Update.... Almost four years later and I now have five of these babys all humming along under heavy use at home and at work.... The best mouse ever.
4,Best mouse we had,"It is great and works on almost any surface much better than the other five mice I used in the past. Great range too.very percise.Wish the battery last a little longer and maybe couple more buttons for additional action.after almost a year of light usage, now it is acting on its own.need a replacement soon"
4,Great feel / Bad battery life,"Plus:Love the feel and accuracy of the device. The weight is perfect for me and the buttons provide just the right amount of resistance.Could Improve:Battery doesn't last that long (about 3 days) if you leave it on and turning it off isn't all that convenient. However, there are two batteries that are given so switching them out is painless and only a couple of seconds."
4,Involved plotting,"Very nice first mystery about a club golf pro. Has a complex plot with many characters. The hero is described well, but some of the mystery is generated by the abbreviated treatment of the other characters."
2,One of Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Fairytale Operas,"Sung in German with no English subtitles, this is the Harry Kupfer production from Dresden's Semper Opera House. The film was made in 1978, in what was then East Germany, and makes a hash out of Pushkin's original story. This version is so heavily cut as to render the storyline almost incomprehensible. Even the best piece in the opera (the lovely tenor aria from Act III) is gone! With its Russian origins so obscured by conventionally schlocky costumes and makeup, one would hope the cinematography would compensate for it. Alas, this is not the case either - most of the camera work is truly hokey. The singers do a good job (they are identified only at the end); kudos must go to the wonderful Semper orchestra and conductor. This is a video that should interest only the serious student of Russian opera. And, unfortunately, if you don't speak German, it will go over like a lead balloon."
5,Benny -- My Granddaddy,"Great fiddler!I enjoyed the tape because it was nostalgic for me.It was bitter sweet because Granddaddywas 100 times better when he was in his prime.No one has a recording of him when he was the 'Best.'But, still, it is a treasure.I remember going to sleep to his tunes when I was young.So, if you've never been spoiled by listeningto him 'live' in the '50s ... Get it! ... you'll like it!Belinda 'Thomasson' Bowman"
4,Book 2 - where's book 3?,"This is a very interesting continuation of the story started by these authors in 'masters of solitude'. At the end of this book you have the main characters going looking for the 'missing' character of the first book.Unfortunatley, I've never been able to find out if book 3 was ever written - so while you have 2 very good books here - there's no real conclusion - very frustrating. Authors should NOT be allowed to start a series and not finish it! - especially when it is published as a 'trilogy'."
4,An intriguing theme...,"A great book- even without a great story.The humankind evolved into two separate societies- The City, almost immortals with a compulsion for using technology, and The Covens, based on earth magic and developers of group telepathy.The plot takes place after a mingling of the two societies, when a few of the masters of the covens have come to live in the city.A young ""goddess""- the term for a master telepath - is trying hard to reach her daughter's heart- but only on her own terms. Her husband, also a master, can't hold on to their bond and ultimately will lose her to madness.I can tell you something: never in the last 10 years did I stay awake all night afraid of shadows, as happened when I finished this book... There are some pages that will scare you a lot- if you are like me - that is, if you fear madness...Absolutely fantastic. I longed for the thrill :) and I got it from an unexpected source :).If only there was a third book as promised... Didn't find it anywhere..."
3,Alphaville meets 007 On the Corner,"Stumbled over this cd and at first I was like, why'd I spend my hard earned money on this all instrumental, futuristic in someones garage sounding music. But like true outsider art this seems to have been made for the pleasure of creation not mass consumption. It took me two listens and loved ""Joinus"". Then played ""Thank You"" in the car and it hit me from all sides. Excellent. But my favorite was ""We Go Towards"" which sounded like it was out of the French Surrealist movie ""Alphaville"" meets 007 with dabs of Miles Davis' 70s trippy/funk album ""On the Corner"". Chrome is very cool music to listen to as you slide through a dark city on a rainy night. Those three warrant buying this; you might like a few others. This is a C+."
1,Lenin: A Study in the Unity of His Thought,"Sir:I did purchase the same day this book by Lukacs together with the book by David Romer Advanced Macroeconomics. However, I have received only the book by Romer.Thanks for your atttentionJose Oscategui"
3,Religious Pioneers,"I think this is a must for all Utahns, Mormon and ""gentile"". It is a very readable history helping one to understand the Mormon people as pioneers and as a religious group."
5,A great XPH psionic support,"With the Expanded Psionic Handbook comes new rules and slightly different version of D&D psionics. Hyperconscious not only adds new content, exploring the Region of Dreams, but also updates the previous Malhavoc psionic books. So you get an adventure, a bunch of Prestige Classes, many feats (including some missing psionic feats) and lots of powers (all updated to XPH rules with Augmentations) all within one book."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"This is a very good book. If you are a dodger fan you will really enjoy reading about the Dodgers world chapionships and star players. If you hate the Dodgers you will like reading about the Al Cappanis contreversy, the piazza trade and all that went wrong for the LA Dodgers. This book has it all. Great job by STeve Delsohn. Go Dodgers!!!!"
5,Top of the line sports writing,"A little while ago, I gave 5 stars to a book called ""The Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told."" While I stand by that rating, that book still pales in comparison to this one.The Dodgers have a rich history and with the exception of the Yankees, are probably the most successful and stories baseball franchise. This oral history gives a behind the scenes look at the incidents that shaped L.A. Dodger history.Every big event from 1958-2000 is covered, from the move to Los Angeles to Koufax's retirement to the Big Blue Wrecking Crew to Kirk Gibson's famous home run to the selling of the team to Fox. Delsohn does a good job at allowing both sides to speak about controversial issues and allows the reader to use his or her own judgment as to where the truth lies.For any fan of baseball, I recommend this book. For any fan of the Dodgers, I would say this is a must-read."
5,I wanted to hate this book!,"I am a transplanted Cub fan living in LA and am forced to endure the antics of the Dodgers. With the exception of Vin Scully. the preeminent baseball announcer, I can truly say I loathe the Dodgers, yet I really enjoyed this book.It really plays out like a soap opera and I really like how the personalities involved get to tell their side of the story. I found it interesting to read about the early days of the LA Dodgers when Leo Durocher was undermining Walter Alston, the holdout of Drysdale and Koufax, the events leading up to Maury Wills being traded. I also enjoyed reading about the team of the 70's and how the players really felt about Steve Garvey. Some pretty juicy stuff is revealed throughout this book and the reader is privvy to all of it. I just wonder if the author ever approached Mr Scully for his take on things.This book is a welcome addition to my sports library."
4,A terrific trip down memory lane.,"This is a very enjoyable, very engaging book that is well-organized, well-written, and just plain fun. It's a great trip down memory lane, reading again about the thoughts of the players I watched growing up and recollecting and reliving the events of those years. The bottom line on this book is that if you are a Dodger fan, it is must reading. Thank you, Mr. Delsohn, for a great time!"
2,Overall disappointment,"Despite having 5.8 GHZ and digital spread spectrum technology, the sound quality is poor, much worse than a Radio Shack product I purchased about three years ago but is no longer made. The handset is not comfortable to hold against the ear. Unfortunately every year there seems to be fewer and fewer 2-line cordless phone options offered. I choose this brand due to price. it was lower than V-Tech or Panasonic units. Maybe the others are better. Another complaint is that the headset buttons are very small and hard to read. There are a lot of features on this phone system but a real problem is that it becomes cumbersome to do things that should be simple, like having someone pick up the other handset and immediately be able to join in conversation. The instructions are clear and easy to follow if you have the patience to read them."
2,Fitzroy travels through Russia,"OK, Fitzroys best book is ""Eastern Approaches"".Detailed travels through Russia...wordy descriptions of street layouts,etc..."
5,Willie,Who knew that Gordon from Sesame Street was a pimp. I first saw this movie on television a couple of months ago and had to have it. The music and clothes will take you back.
3,Classic,"It was an interesting amount of Player Hatin' in that film. Some of it was good but it was more of a ""Before Gordon Came To Sesame Street"" kinda tale."
4,Good storyline with postive ending,"It starts off stupid kind of cartoonish with that walk of his but the highlight is his ARCHENEMY in the movie that makes the movie very good. And the acting is better then some black explotation films,as they were called back in the 70'S but those were the only breaks they had was these movies and black america ate them up .Their were alot of good movies with some good acting alot of these movies didn't make it on video like this one which was better then alot black movies on video today their alot of them I am waiting for like HIT MAN,CLADINE,TOGETHER BROTHERS,to name some these are the best that I REMEMBER RENT IT OR BUY THIS ONE YOU WILL ENJOY IT CAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE VISOOOOOOON ...PEACE OUT"
3,Isn't it disturbing to see...,"...Roscoe Orman playing a ruthless pimp.For those who don't know, Orman is better known, by MILLIONS of children worldwide, as Gordon from SESAME STREET.DISTURBING!!! LOL"
2,Waste of Time Video,I did not like this movie. I enjoyed the Mack much better. The price on this video should of been cheaper.
3,Typical Blaxplotation,Story line was kind of jagged and as is typical of the genre the acting was not Oscar caliber but still an entertaining film. Outrageous costumes! Some funny scenes. Good addition to your Blaxplotation films collection.
1,Very Fluffy Music,Her previous 3 albums were very tastefully done and her songs made much more sense and the lyrics and the videos were not out of hand. UP! is a disaster waiting to happen first off there are way too many tracks on this album I say the limit is 10 to 12 songs on a album but no more then that. There is just two much material. here. The songs were just stupit and there just unreal. Country music is about being real and her latest video does not look very real at all and even if this is supposed to be pop it's pretty bad. Double cd's red and green cd's and a fluffy album cover the album is just too much. I compare this album to overfilling your dinner plate at a buffet.
2,"aka ""Gonna Take You Good""","Bought it cuz liked ""Gonna getcha good."" But that was the only one I liked; the rest were comical. Should have released as a single. My 7 year old likes, tho, so not a total loss."
3,"Not quite ""Come on Over""","I have mixed feelings about this CD. Most of the songs are up (no pun intended) and she is in great form. There are a few real winners on this set like the title track and ""I'm Gonna Get You Good."" Actually I think ""Juanita"" is the best cut here. And better yet, this is a two CD set (did anybody know that?) for the price of one. There are a generous 19 songs on each CD. Each has the same songs but one has the songs in ""pop"" style and the other is ""country"". Actually, I can hardly tell the difference and she is far from country now anyway. Unfortunately, the whole thing is not as good as ""Come on Over."" That was a hard act to follow. There were so many really great songs on that CD. Here there are some good songs, some fun songs but few are great. Overall, this is a disappointment."
5,Great CD & Great experience,"They had to be thinking of me when they made this CD. It's a double CD but they are both the same! At first I thought it was crazy but then thouth twice b/c I was now able to leave one in my car and one in my clock radio. I'm strange I know.I would also like to say that I have only 2 bad experiences w/ Amazon and the second was really my fault, I waited too long to order the CD and it came too late to be used. It was a gift for a shower and I'll just use it for another shower.I had my car broken into and all my CDs (over 35)stollen, and trying to replace them has been a slow and costly process. If it wasn't for Amazon I would not have been able to replace as many as I have. If anything, the reason for the CD gift mishap was because Amazon has spoiled me by getting most of my purchases here faster then they were supposed to. I have total faith in them."
2,"I love Shania, but...","As a country fan, I enjoyed her last 2 or 3 albums. They were very poppish, but had country themes and instruments. With this most recent release, she's lost all semblance of country and stepped energetically into pop. I wish her luck. But, as a fan of her last few albums, she's lost me. If you are a country fan that enjoyed Shania, it's probably best you listen to this album before you buy. My copy is already given away.Wes Y. Keller"
5,Outstanding Music - But a little confusing,"Great CD, instant hits are recognizable the first time you hear the songs. The set is a two CD version, one that favors country and one that favors pop, I maybe old but both CD's sound the same, so I guess you can leave one in the car and one at the house. A definite Buy!!"
5,Shania's back!!,"Wow!! Shania's back and better than ever! I couldn't wait til her album came out and when it finally did, I had to get it. Her new songs are so energizing and meaningful!! Comes with a terrific bonus disc!! Unbelivably superb!! Thanks Shania! This was definitely worth the wait! She is so beautiful and her voice is so amazing!! If you don't have this 2 cd set, you should definitely get your hands on one. You won't regret it! Thanks!"
4,Up!,More of the same formula that made her last cd so great. Sometimes to close to last songs. Great to hear her voice after the long break. Comes with 2 copies of cd? Doesn't say why. Does play in my computer. Maybe to discourage not to copy. I don't know. Shania rock on!
5,Are you crazy!!!,"I think this is a great album. Its even better than the last one. I loved every song on this cd. For those who dont like country music. I think country music has really improved, in the last few years. Country may not be too innovative, but its a lot better than some of the [stuff] they have today on the pop or rock stations. Dont get me wrong' I still like some of the new pop or rock artists. But the song writers and some of the singers in country music are a whole lot better. Just listen to Martina McBride sing ""A Broken Wing"" and you'll no what I mean. She can sing just as good as any pop or rock star. If you really want to see how much country has evolved, buy Shania's cd."
2,It's just there,"If you want up tempo Shania (such as ""Rock this Country"" or ""Don't Impress Me Much"") then look else where. When I first played the whole CD I found myself not even really paying attention. It was just back ground music while I was driving.Definitly far from her best!!"
4,It's good...but not as good as Come On Over,"Shania Twain has never failed to entertain my ears when I'm in the mood for country. Her lyrics, melodies all seem to blend into one....one bad note I must say, most of the songs sound the same on ""Up"" as compared to ""Come On Over"" - but then again, Shania Twain is known for her voice rather than her songwriting, which is mediocre...but she gets 4 stars for this album. Can't wait to see you in concert!"
5,"Shania's ""Up!"" Again!","Shania's latest CD hasn't been given good reviews and credit it deserves. Up! may not be Come On Over, but it still offers the best of Shania Twain.Her songs ""Up!"", ""I'm Gonna Getcha Good!"", ""Forever and For Always"", ""(Want To Know Ya) That Good"", Thank You Baby"", I'm Not In The Mood (To Say No)"", and ""When You Kiss"" are destined to be hits!Shania however does lose her climaxes on this album like in ""Man! I Feel Like A Woman"" and ""That Don't Impress Me Much"".Hopefully Shania Twain will be nomiated for Grammys!"
5,UP! is an AMAZING album from our CANADIAN POP QUEEN!,Shania's new cd UP! is amazing! She is a very talented singer/songwriter. ... There are no hip-hop songs on the new album for one thing so I don't know what that other reviewer was talking about. There are 2 cd's included...one is POP and one is country. The songs are the same and the only difference between the 2 cd's is that some of the instruments have been changed to give it a different sound. Shania and Mutt have worked very hard to create cool news songs for this album and they deserve a heck of a lot more credit than they are getting ... Take it from a girl that knows good music when she hears it....I think this album rocks and if Shania doesn't getcha good knowone else will!
4,Shania at Her Best,"Good video and a great new song. If you like Shania Twain, then you will want to add this one to your library."
5,phill b on 'up',Could Shania better Come On Over. Yes is the answer. Superb from beginning to end and 3 different mixes depending on your mood. Love it!
5,movin' & groovin!,"actually, i was never into country and music like shania performed. but one day i juss turned around and decided to listen to other stuff besides rap and britney-like pop so i listened to different types of songs. next thing u noe i run over Up! by Shania and wow-wee! i was amazed at how upbeat the music was. i knew if i didn't buy it, i'd kik myself the next time i was in the blues.buy it! it's fun and cheerful."
4,"not Up! to par, but good","After ""Come on Over"" we all knew Twain was going to have a nearly impossible task of following it up with a super-hit album. However, Up! is an enjoyable country/pop combo. that pleases listeners. Not every track is great but more than a few good songs exists on this massave 2 disc 19 track monster. ""UP!"" is a fun songs, but not great. ""She's Not Just A Pretty Face"" is a good song, quite infectious. ""Forever And For Always"" is an O.K. ballad, but ""It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing"" and ""When You Kiss Me"" steal the show. Songs like ""Nah"" are so dumb that they are good and funny.The real problem is figuring out which version to listen to. Most often the ""pop"" version is superior, but not always. It takes time to adapt to the album, but it is well worth the money."
4,It's all good,"This album took a long time to grow on me. At first I thought it was a let-down, I mean 5 years for this? But the more I listened to it, the more I realized Shania was always about the escapism of music - she can make you forget about your problems and soothe you like no one else can. I love the song ""Forever and For Always"", the cool beats in ""Juanita"" and the positivity in the title track. ""She's Not Just a Pretty Face"" and ""In My Car"" are both great, upbeat songs about independent women without being overpowering and 'preachy'. She slows it down with ""It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing"", which has 'hit' all over it. Hopefully fans will not have to wait another five years for the next CD and tour."
5,Shania - As expected...great.,"Another marvelous album from a terrific song writer, performer and most of all a great human being. Thank you Shania for many hours of pleasurable listening. This music crosses many lines but the most astonishing to me is that my son 13 and myself 56 both love listening to it."
3,"What's ""UP""","You mean to tell me I waited 5 years for this!The concept of offering POP and Country versions of the same songs is unique from a merchandising stand point but to say that the country version is country is misrepresented.It's same music, style,with just a fiddle and steel guitar added.Most of the lyrics are trite and repetitive to say the leastI'm a Twain fan but these are not country songs- far from it. Shes testing the cross over waters for a permanent stay!"
4,Shania is BACK,"After a long break, Shania blasts back with an album sure to garner a lot of attention. In addition to a non stop musical train of 19 songs, included are the much spoken of two discs, one version more country and one more pop/rock. Kudos to her and her management for that courtesy to her diverse fan base.I love the opening song ""UP"", a top tapping, finger snapping, head nodding tune that also has an inspirational hint of dealing with stress in life's hectic pace. The songs that follow are diverse and very catchy, intriguing, and entertaining. From the upbeat ""In My Car"" (I'll Be The Driver), ""I'm Not In the Mood"", and ""What A Way to Wanna Be"" to the slower paced triumph-in-life anthems ""I Ain't Goin Down"", ""She's Not Just A Pretty Face"", and ""C'jest La Vie"", to intriguing tunes with a different beat including the really cool ""Waiter, Bring Me Water"" and the oh-so-true ""Ka-Ching"", and the touching ending soft tune ""When You Kiss Me"", this is a great CD!"
3,Maybe it will grow on me ...,"I've listened through the green CD (country) a couple of time and the red cd (Pop) once. Nothing strikes me as being terrific or an immediate chart topper. The songs pretty much all sound the same. Even the country side still rings of some sort of Euro-electronic-pop. Maybe it will grow on me after a while .... If nothing else, it's a great value at 38 songs"
2,Extremely disappointed!,"I can't believe she put out an entire album of this junk. Almost every single song sounds the same. She needs to develop a new style of music, because all of her songs are beginning to blend together. She will not define herself as an artist until she can carve out her own niche. I do like her voice, so I hope that she can try something different."
1,Save Your Money!,"...I can't believe that it took her five years to come up with this pile of garbage. The music is nothing but a bunch of pre-programmed keyboards. The lyrics are so simple minded, a five year old could write better! As for the singing, I think Shania could use a few lessons! I would much rather listen to a c.d. full of Barney songs, than to sit through this c.d. again. Save your money for the aspirin, this c.d. will give you an earache!"
3,So-so from Shania,"I had been wanting this CD forever and when I finally got it for Christmas, I was let down. It honestly is nowhere near as good as her last CD. There are too many songs (19) and about half are just mediocre songs. She took off 5 years to deliever this?? I don't get it. I personally love the songs ""Up"", ""When You Kiss Me"" ""I'm gonna Getcha Good"" and a few select others. There are just too many corny songs such as ""Ka-Ching"" and ""Waiter, bring me Water"" that are too outthere for me. Everyone who reads this needs to trust me, this CD is NOT all that it's hyped up to be."
2,why,"As a linedancer from england ( and a country music fan) I have to question the companies decision to release the red & blue versions in the uk. why was the green country version not made available to us ?it seems that the record lable has yet again failed to appreciate the impact of country music in the uk and have released a indian (wolrld music) version which may proove to be popular in London and the south but is of no interest to those of us living in the freezing north.there are some good tracks on the album in my car being just one but the vocal talents of shania are shown to their best advantage in country based and phrased songs.shania, dump the pop and world stuff and stick to what you are so good at.keep it countryandy"
4,UPlifting!,"""Come On Over"" was a tough act to follow but Shania Twain definitely did a pretty nice job with this album. UP is a very UPlifting 19-song collection. My personal favorites are: UP, I'm Gonna Getcha Good, It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing, Nah!, and I Aint Goin Down. And as with the previous album, she ends this one with a very romantic, You've Got A Way-type track, When You Kiss Me. Overall, this album is very well-made and it deserves 7.5/10 rate."
3,I'm at ease to enjoy this album...,"I'm totally at ease to enjoy this album, even if it's better or not than COME ON OVER, even if it has silly lyrics, whatever complaints people can have abou this album. Why? Well, I can enjoy it with tranquility because I did not spend one dollar purchasing it. I just burned it in my CD copy hardware, and that's it. Why? Because you don't need a booklet or something for a Shani Twain. The lyrics are as shallow as possible, there is no thematic linking the songs, it's just a pop output. Do yourself a favor: this is the kind of album to copy, not to buy!"
5,Shania's Best,I sure didn't think Come On Over could be topped but Shania and Mutt have done it again! This cd is the best Shania has released and a must for Shania fans. I can listen to this album over and over again. On this cd you get to hear more of Mutt's voice which is excellent and the songs are so original. Shania and Mutt amaze the world once again!
4,Not Sure Why All the Negative Reviews,"This has been my first Shania Twain CD I've purchased and really like it. She really does have her own style. The instrumentations are great, and the songs catchy. I do like the creativity of the packaging. Overall good investment. Moreover, I'm posting the photo insert on my office desk board. Prettiest female singer in the music industry!!!"
5,fan from Boston,"I'm not a country music fan, but I love both disks and can't wait to get my hands on the European version which as I understand substitutes the country disk with an ""Indi"" disk (Bollywood type music). Thank you Shania - this was worth the wait."
5,This one definitely gets five stars!!!,"I bought Up! two days ago and have been listening to it constantly ever since!!! I have been a huge Shania fan for years, and the new album does not disappoint (especially the songs Nah!, Up!, C'est la Vie, That Good! and When You Kiss Me). I was initially skeptical about the different mixes and thought that separating pop and country in her songs might take something away, but all the songs still have that country flair - even on the red CD. Listening to the different versions of each song has been really fun because the differences are very subtle but each version does have its own flavor. The green CD has dominated my CD player, but like I said, the red CD is fun, too... I can't wait until the blue CD is released in the US! (I'm sure they'll release it sooner or later...)"
1,BIG Disappointment,I became a Shania fan with her last album. This album was quite a disappointment. All the songs sounded the same. It was very boring .....I sold the CD after listening to it only once...don't wast your money!
1,JUST A PRETTY FACE,"Shania Twain? If you look up for the meaning in a dictionary, it would be 'Shania Twain means a female singer with pretty face and terrible voice. Sorry for all her admirers, sometimes the truth is so hard to swallow, isn't it? I admit that I've bought her CD just to get her picture in the booklet!!! Her voice is so...unbearable. Her latest DVD concert with Alison Krauss and the Union Station can prove all my judgement! Apart from her intolerable voice, her hand movement while singing is also annoying as well. This one star is totally coming from her 'just a pretty face'"
2,uh...,"im a shania fan but this was too pop....she tried waaaay to hard to be a pop artist....the only half decent song was ""UP!""....and the country version [disc 2] of the cd was horribly fake! i like pop but this was terrible for her, she needs to go back to her cd ""come on over"" NOW!"
4,My all time favorite courtry artist!,"As a kid I hated courtry, now I found a artist that had a newer sound, the rest of the artist I could not even understand what they were saying with that huge accent! The beat of the rest sounded all the same! But not Twain, she sounded different and more creative with her music. It is rumor that she called the quits on her music. But I hope that is not true!"
4,Enjoyable Enough,"I never realized how whiney Shania Twain's voice can really be until I got this CD. Nonetheless, I enjoy it well enough and I don't regret spending the money on it. It is a little pricier than it should be. It's not as if you're getting a two CD set of best hits....it's two CDs of the same songs, and while there is a difference in the two versions, it's really pretty minute. There are 19 songs, which is more than most CDs contain, but it becomes clear during the last half of the album that Mutt Lange, a veteren producer, knew that none of those songs would be able to carry an entire CD on their own. At times, the songs sound so similar it's hard to tell where one song ends and the next begins without glancing at your CD player to see the track number.Die hard Shania fans will probably enjoy this CD as much as any of her previous albums. Others may not be as accepting. But it's good enough to get a few songs that you will not be able to help but sing along with."
1,A Dissapointment,I'm a fan of Shania Twain but this CD was really dissapointing. It has only one good song (I'm gonna get you) and the rest have lyrics that either don't make sense or are just plain boring/stupid. I should have listened to the bad reviews and not bought it.
2,"Not as good as her other albums, expected it to be better","This album is by far her worst album to date. I expected it to be so much better, especially since it took so long for it to come out. The Women in Me and Come On Over are full of hit songs that you can listen to over and over again. However, with this album most of the songs are just plain annoying and unbearable to listen to. Whats with the two discs? The country and Pop ones basically sound the same. It's pretty silly and lame that there are two different discs. ANyways, it Should have been better. I expect a lot more from Shania on her next album."
1,not much going on here,yeah She is a Babe&whatnot but that has nothing too do with the overall product which leaves me feeling kind of empty.Her voice just doesn't move me as much as some of Her Previous tracks.this Album feels like Nashville Shine.She is too young&early in her Music Making Career too be Rehashing Material so soon.not a track on this set really stands out for me.More Factory driven than anything else.and the Lyrics are as Bland as most of what is out nowadays.
2,Commerical,This CD was kind of dissappointing.I could tell it was made to be a hit.It was way too commercial..I needed somethign with emotions.....feeling...and just...something was missing. Not a bad CD but I rather go with Mariah Carey.
2,"Too Bad Shania, I loved you","Wow! I can't believe this CD got so many great reviews. Have you been a fan since her first CD? If you have, I can't believe you would love this one so much. I was disappointed and I love Shania. I have all her CD's. This newest one just doesn't have the catchy, fun beats as her previous ones have.No real ""country feel."" I really loved ""Woman In Me"" and ""Come On Over"" and this doesn't come close. I have a feeling that the people who give glowing reviews are big fans of now pop singer Faith Hill, LeeAnn Rimes, and the rest who left country."
4,It ain't great but it's good.,"I was a fan of hers when I first heard the song 'You're still the one. I then looked up on some of her old music.....and I liked those too! 'If you're not in it for love' 'You win my love 'and 'the woman and me' and 'From this moment' and others. I thought wow! I wonder what her new cd will sound like....At first when I listened to it. It was so different. I didn't really like it at all but after I listened to it for a while....I started to actually like a couple of the tracks. I loved, Up! and especially I'm gonna getcha good and also when you kiss me and like 2 other tracks. But I think she did push it a bit with Waiter Bring me water! That was...not a good track. But hey overall this is a pretty good cd. better than average but not great. so i gave it a 4... somewhere around a grade of a B. It's okay though. All artists can't top every cd with the next. But maybe she'll top come on over with another cd? Ya never know."
5,Great,Man for the first time you do not have to buy (2) Cd's to get the country feel and the pop feel of Shania's music..She has it both in one excellent Cd. What a great talent...The music covers every aspect of one's life and it gives us a lot of inspiration...You go Shania
2,A disappointment,"The first two songs are great, but the rest of the CD is completely and totally forgettable. I was disappointed. Shania's lyrics get more and more mundane with each new album."
2,Expected Much More,"I am a huge Shania fan and must say, I was really let down with her new cd. There wasn't one song out of nineteen that was awesome or really caught my attention. It doesn't leave you wanting to hear it again. I know it is hard to compete with what she had on her last two cd releases, but this isn't even close at all. It sounds as if she didn't want to sing. Her voice sounds so nasaly and not her full range that was heard before. I have put it aside and hope that the next time I listen it will grow on me, but thus far, no such luck.."
1,Worst Shania Twain CD ever,"Over Thanksgiving my family bought this CD and listened to it in the van on the way home from a trip. The CD was awful, all of the songs sound almost the same and and don't live up to Shania's standard. Excercise caution when buying this CD."
3,That Don't Impress Me Much,"Let me start out by saying that I am big fan of Shania Twain. Her videos and CD ""Come on Over"" got me hooked on country music. I have been waiting three years for her follow up CD.This CD starts out good with the title track ""UP"" and her first single ""I'm Gonna Getha Good"", but after that doesn't go anywhere. The only other song that I like is ""In My Car"". The remaining sixteen songs are nothing special. It will be interesting to see what she releases for singles off this CD.This CD is mostly upbeat and contains no special ballets like ""From This Moment On"" and ""You're Still the One"" that she had on her previous CD. You would think out of 19 songs she would of had a couple of ballets.I bought this CD on its first day of sale, due to her last CD. Her next CD, she will have to win me over again with some better music before I would buy it."
5,Shania's back - and as good as ever!,"It ain't pop, it ain't country, but who cares! The industry ""critics"" may hate it, buy Shania's back and as good as ever. Up is excellent and contains many catchy tunes. It leaves the listener feeling ""up"" after hearing it.Shania knows how to keep her fans happy - 2 discs with the same songs: one leaning to country, one to pop. Personally, I prefer the green disc with the more country versions, but some of the songs are better on the red disc - the more pop versions. It really doesn't matter which one you listen to - you get twice the bang for the same buck!"
5,Awesome,"Just bought the CD today and I love both discs. Like Shania, I grew up listening to one station that played everything from Country to Soul. This is excellent. Do not miss this one."
5,Always listen to it!,"I got a new copy of this CD because the one I had got all scratched up and stopped working. I'm in love with this album, and I'm a tough critic. :)"
2,Definitely not the best Shania can do,"I'm from North Carolina, and I was raised on country music...as long as I can remember, I've been a big fan of Shania Twain. Her songs have always been catchy, with amusing lyrics and her beautiful, unique voice. I was greatly anticipating ""Up!!"", but I was extremely disappointed with what I found. I've always been told not to mess with success - or ""fix what ain't broke."" With this album, Shania clearly tried to fix something that was working wonderfully for her - this CD is of a completely different style than any of her other music. The only songs that I even remotely like are ""Up"" and ""I'm Gonna Getcha Good."" The other songs are irritating. If you liked ""Come on Over,"" you'll probably want to skip this one."
4,Ok....,"I am a huge Shania Twain fan. I must say, however, that Come On Over was a much better CD and I don't think she will ever top it. Her lyrics are still catchy, and this makes her ever more popular. Nah!, Waiter Bring Me Water!, What A Way To Wanna Be!, Cest La Vie, and Up! are all upbeat and have catchy lyrics that we can all relate to. They begin to sound the same, however. It Only Hurts When I Am Breathing and I'm Jealous are a bit slower, but are really beautiful songs.If you are new to Shania Twain, buy Come On Over first, because it truly is better and later on by this CD because it is still worth having. ""Any Man of Mine"" and 'Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under"" are from The Woman In Me are also great songs to start off with.If you are a Shania Twain fan, buy this CD because it is definitly worth having. But don't expect another Come On Over."
5,It will grow on you after a few spins...,"I read a lot of the previous reviews and I think the naysayers expected too much out of Shania. She had a tall order by following Come on Over. The five years between albums probably didn't help matters either. But, this album isn't a rehash of Come on Over. I believe some fans expected this and are disappointed. Instead, Shania is being Shania and marching to her own drummer. The album is definitely different, but that is what makes it great. The red (pop) version really shows the influence of her husband. The drums, bass and backup singers sound like they came straight off of Def Leppard's Hysteria (which he produced). Lot's of fun!Just like the previous albums, I have had to listen to the CD a few times to really enjoy it. If you are a Shania fan, it will grow on you. Give it a spin, I guarantee you'll like it. Shania remains my favorite female artist. Now if I can just get my hands on the blue version."
5,Perfect Blend of Country and Pop,"I'm not really a fan of country music, but this cd is great! It's more like country meets pop, but the blend is perfect for Shania's style. This is just a great cd to listen to; it makes you feel carefree. All in all, Shania did a great job and she has won a new fan!"
5,A GREAT JOB BY SHANIA AND HUSBAND!!,"This CD is one of the best I have ever heard. Each and every song was written and sung with nothing but heart and honesty. I only have one of Shania's earlier CD's, but this is my favorite. The lyrics are heartfelt and the arrangements are outstanding on both CD's. I did not really see too much difference between the 2 versions, but having 2 CD's gave me the option for one at home and one at work!! GREAT JOB; you will not be disappointed!!"
4,A Reviewer of Shania Twain's Up.....,"Shania Twain's ""UP"" is a good cd but not her best CD. I liked Come On Over better! Some of the good song on her album are:Up, Nah, Ka Ching, In My Car, It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing, and Ain Not Particular Way...Overall I would rate this cd 8/10..."
4,Expected more,"You can't listen to this album once. If you do that, you'll forever hate it. I know I did. I was completly disapointed, listenign to the album the first time, I expected so much more from Shania & Mutt. So a week later I decieded to give the album another chance, and it started to grow on me a little. And with each listen, I grew to love it even more. Personally, I rather the red CD.I highly reccomend the following songs off this album: Up!; Ain't no Particular Way; Nah!; Cest La Vie; I'm Jealous, Ka Ching (I think this is my favorite on the album); Waiter Bring me Water; In my Car. The res are ok, at best. She's not just a Pretty FAce and Juanita are real disapointments though."
4,Shania rocks!,"I wasn't sure what I was going to think of this album. I had heard Shania's crossover hits, and they were very good. But a whole album? Let's see. Apparently the CD version of this album was a two-disc set, one disc with pop versions of the 19 songs, and the other with country versions. Since I bought the DVD-Audio version, which contains the pop versions, I couldn't compare the pop and country. But I didn't care. I got caught up in some great sounds. Shania can sing for me anytime. I was less blown away by the sonics. DVD-Audio is capable of a very wide dynamic range. (For you non-audiophiles out there, that's the ratio between the softest and loudest sounds.) While the surround mix, as done by Mike Shipley, was first-rate, the sound seemed constricted. This is definitely not the album to use to show off a great surround system."
3,SHOCKING RECORD (AND THE STORY BEHIND IT),"UP, according to advance word, was supposed to be a low-key operatic album with songs written around the theme of Shania making a meal -- each track was to represent a certain ingredient in making a wonderful dinner. You can still hear remnants of that initial concept, but somehow the idea got derailed by the need to make hits, hits and more hits. The result is an album that sounds like Reba McEntire meets the Ramones meets Cyndi Lauper meets the Dixie Chicks meets David Bowie. It leaves me with a lot of questions like ... why is Shania's voice so high all the time? And what does that strange title mean? Get this album only if you like to be confused."
2,Weak beats,"Although most of the reviews I've read on this CD are overwhelmingly positive, I was really disappointed. Besides the first single ""I'm gonna getcha good"" and the ballad ""it only hurts when I'm breathing"", there is not much that could be expected to get airplay. I don't mind the fact that her lyrics lack substance, but they don't have the rhythms and arrangements to make up for it either. Some of the songs, especially ""she's not just a pretty face"" just plain hurt to listen to they're so bad. Whatever you do, don't expect anything close to her last CD, which had plenty of material to get stuck in your head for days. Go buy Faith Hill's Cry instead, which is one of the best CD's of the year out of the twenty something I've bought this year."
2,It Don't Impress Me Much,"This is a case of a beautiful,energetic,and talented performer with a very mediocre album. Some of the songs are very catchy and have a good beat but there is little substance here. I guess grandpa was right when he said today's music is targeted for teenage kids."
4,UP! Great Pop CD.,"After hearing and watching the ""Gonna Getcha Good"" video I couldn't help but me reminded of Waylon Jennings strumming his accoustic guitar at some Texas rodeo. NOT.................. Shania Twain was never country music, If she has had been discovered by NYC managers instead of Nashville, she would have been the pop princess she naturally is.This CD is closer to Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears then Garth Brooks (not counting his alter ego/split personality Chris Gaines HA!) and Alan Jackson. Her Last CD ""Come on Over"" was quite possibly the most technically crafted produced album since Def Leapord's Hysteria. Gonna Getcha Good sounds very similar to ""that don't impress me much"". I loved the pop version of Come on Over, and if you were one of the 34 million who bought the last CD, you wont be disappointed. So buy this CD again, because the Twain's need to purchase another castle in someplace like India or Tokyo to get influences for the next CD."
1,We waited 5 years for this,"I expected a lot more from Shania with her talents. But this CD is bad, 1 star was 1 too many. I can give her this, there is 1 good song on the CD, I'm gonna get you good - That's it. I really can't beleive I wasted my money on this.It doesn't have the the flare that we've come to expected and enjoy from Shania Twain."
2,Not up to her usual stuff,"Shania seems to have rushed this one together. Most of the ""band"" is synthesized. The songs sound mostly alike with similar rhythms and sounds. I was very disappointed."
4,Great!,"It was worth waiting for, as her last CD Come On Over was....Shania only puts out the best and waits until she has the best to do just that. The woman is incredible...a 2 CD set to make everyone happy, the ""country"" people and the ""pop"" people. Well, let's just say this...she did good! Faith, you neva had a chance. Shania is the Queen!"
5,Shania's album can only go UP!,"I've heard all of Shainia's CD's so I was so excited to hear her new one. That time off really helped her because this CD rocks!The title track ""UP!"" really gets you going. This is a great song to wake you up in the morning because it will surely get you out of bed! One of my favorites, ""Ka-Ching!"" talks about how our world has got so obsessed with money. Not only does it have a great beat, but a great message. ""When You Kiss Me"" is a beautiful love song that will make your heart melt. ""It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing"" is a song about heartbreak, but surviving it. Seriously, every song on the album is great! This is perfect for Shania or country fans!!! Plus, it comes with two CD's! One POP, one COUNTRY! You can't lose."
1,OBVIOUSLY THE BEST ALBUM IN EXISTENCE OBVIOUS OBVIOUS!,"All false fatties will be destroyed in the nether-fire!""Burn the weak-kneed virgins, cast them beneath our anvils of God's almighty wrath, spurn the cheeky venom from their faces flushed-a-rose with hatred immortal--nay witches of the night, unite! Ohh, Ohh, I love your smile!""The burning chaos of truth, syrum-like revealed, reviled, irrefuted for all ages in a chorus as sick as this:""Oh, twisted-throated nubile nymph, do not to thy tortured wisp of feigned recognizances. 'Tis a dagger unspurned that hast cleft thy unfrettled gruntbuggly in twain, oh! Ohh, Ohh, Aiieee you so fine, y'all! You so fine, y'all! Y'all Y'all Y'all.""Yes, Shania is truly the best singer. Keep it real, soul sistah!"
2,Buy it for the picture - but not for the music,"Yes, as so many reviews have already said, Shania Twain is beautiful. That said, if it were a DVD there may be some redeeeming value to this music. However, with endless songs sounding the same in both the country and pop versions, this CD is an absolute bomb. Why the two stars?? My wife loves Shania Twain, and in deference to her taste I recognize this album must in some way be better than I think it is. However, 2 stars is twice the rating that I think it deserves."
4,up is over the top,This c.d is so cool. It's really a continuation of come on over. With l9 songs plus a second c.d of the same songs rerecorded. So you get the radio version plus more songs that she recorded just to show how they would sound if she was in your living room playing them for you. A must have unique c.d.
5,Shania is UP! all right!,"Two CDS of wonderful country music I found with Shania Twain. You should go UP! and buy it despite what people may tell you."" Ka-Ching"" is one of her songs that will make you sing and laugh and once you have listened to all of it she will ""Gonna getcha good!"" Let's go!She's not just a pretty face, because in her car she'll be the driver."
3,Up! Is Down!,"Now, it was cool to have silly titles in 1997, but the ones here are ridiculous! Whats with ""Ka-Ching!"" not to mention the 10 million exclamation points. I like the idea of going country or pop, but im not sure i like the songs enough to get that into it. ""Waiter! Bring me Water!"" is about as dumb as a pet rock, but I like it anyway. Skip this if you don't feel like hearing a little bit of repetitiveness. I like it, but not enough to recommend it."
3,A Little Disappointing,"Let me start out by saying that I am a huge Shania fan and probably had unreasonably high expectations for this album. Nevertheless, ""Up!"" doesn't hold a candle to ""Come on Over"" or ""The Woman in Me"". While there are indeed a couple of brilliant tracks on the CD, including the first release ""I'm Gonna Getcha Good"", most of the songs don't have the edge we've seen before from Shania. With only a couple of exceptions, the melodies are generally simplistic (if not somewhat reminiscent of the 70's) and the lyrics surprisingly sophomoric. The clever instrumentations in both the country and pop versions make up for this to some degree, but I basically found myself listening to the album without feeling inspired in any way, much less inclined to ""toe-tapping"". In a nutshell, most of the music is just ""there"", if not somewhat boring. Shania and her producers obviously spent a lot of time making this collection original in many ways, but it's still missing something."
1,This babe is achingly HOT ..........,"but where would she be without her looks? Her previous music was hardly country, but only the lame country audiences could bear to listen to her music. The ""country versions"" here do sound more like country - pretty gross. At least it's more tolerable than some wimpy, whiney country dude bellowing in some hick voice. Don't people who sing in country accents realize they sound uneducated? The ""pop"" stuff is even more gross. Yes, I actually did listen to this album (as much as I could tolerate).What's the deal with the title ""UP,"" the third major album with that title in just a few years? R.E.M. got it first and that should've been the end of it. Peter Gabriel recently released his ""Up,"" (and it hardly fits the music) but he has some silly need to name his albums with two letter words and choices are limited. Doesn't Shania have people working for her that pay attention to what's going on in the world?"
1,I think the cd is horrible,"i have listen to the cd once so far and its all i can stand, i can't believe how bad this cd actually is, i would not recommend it to anyone. I wish i could return my copy."
3,A review of the aesthetic...,"Since Shania is as much a packaged image as a packaged voice, I'll review the aesthetics of the album instead of the music. Working at a record store, I am forced to look at a giant blow-up of the Up! cover day in and day out, and all I can say is ""What were they thinking?"" Shania looks creepy and evil on the cover, like she should be some pop demon waiting in the shadows to steal your soul. In contrast, she looks gorgeous on the back cover in the laughing shot. Once the case is opened, there is another hideous picture on the back of the booklet with Shania making her hair look as horrible as possible. The fold-out poster looks great, as do the red and green picture discs. The east-indian flavor of the blue disc picture (inner tray) looks just plain wrong. Vacant is the word. So out of seven pictures, there are two terrible ones, one fairly wrong one, and four good ones. How they picked one of the most terrible for the cover, I don't even want to know."
2,Nothing new here,"It amazes me that people consider Shania a great singer. Good maybe - great no. However, if Shania finds another songwriting partner/producer there may be hope for her. This album is a rehash of everything else she and Mutt have done on their last 2 albums only the lyrics are even worse. The country and pop versions of each song is just a cheap attempt to dominate the music scene. If you want something refreshing (and country) buy Shania's first album where she actually had to sing."
4,Definately Up!,"I had few expectations, especially when cds lately have two or three okay songs and the rest are fillers. Shania lives up to her title with both fast and slow songs which I've been listening over and over again since the cd purchase. I've even given it as a b-day gift lately. Love it. Love it. Love it. I wish more cds were as listenable and generous- 19 songs with remixes. How can you loose. Shania, you rock!"
5,Shania Goes UP and only UP,"Shania's new album up, is just what you'd expect from her, Raw Talent, lyrics written by her that are actually relevant to today's world. And the pure awesome power of one of Country's leading ladies. If your a Shania fan, you'll be glad you bought up, if your not a fan, you'll probably still find some things on the album that will suit you well."
2,Gimmick City,"I asked for this album for Christmas last year and I am so dissapointed that I got it! There are a few good songs, yes, but, the whole 2 sets of every song is a crock! They are exactly the same vocals and arranged music with the exeption of the electric guitar on the red disc and the steel guitar on the green one. So much for spreading her wings. If you like Shania, buy come on over and burn a few songs off this one from a friend who got suckered into buying it."
4,Like it!,I like Up much better than Come On Over. I thought Come On Over was very overrated. A Woman in Me was brilliant. Up is a cross between the two. It is a bit overdone at times but for the most part I have enjoyed it. It will definitely be a huge success!
4,really good!,"I like Shania Twain,before she was have great hits like,,from this moment on'',you're still the one,when,etc.Now her album is also great,expecally great song is,,ka-ching!''there are others good songs,like-when you kiss me,up!,i'm gonna getcha good,juanita..."
2,quite disappointed,"There are about four songs that are good. The rest seem to sit there like a bump on a log. The songs seem to have no direction...Up certainly isn't one of them. There is a lot of pointless blather...lyrically and musically.The production is really good, though. My hat of to Mutt...again.To Shania's credit, the vocals are right on and very good. I just didn't think the material was very strong.SpidrVII"
4,"Slightly disappointing, but a hit!","I think it was already going to be tough to top her last, ""Come On Over"", but Shania has done fine with ""Up!"". My favorites included ""When You Kiss Me"", ""Forever In Your Arms"", and ""Up!"". Although her writing is not as polished as ""Come On Over"", I feel this disc will satisfy her fans."
1,This CD is not good,"I used to be a huge fan of Shania, but this cd absolutely blows. I can't figure out why everyone seems to like it so much. Every song sounds the same, and her voice sounds much more nasal than it used to. The songs are all extremely annoying, and the lyrics are the worst lyrics I've ever heard. Why does her shirt that she wears for the cover and liner notes have holes all over it? And why are her hands behind her head in every photograph? Her music has gone way down hill. This is one of the worst cds i've ever heard."
3,Only Decent,"This CD was good, but definitely not what Come On Over was. There are a few memomorable songs on this CD, but other than that, I can't say I really care for it all that much. The only songs worth mentioning are ""When You Kiss Me"", ""I Ain't Goin' Down"", ""I'm Jealous"", ""Nah!"", and ""It Only Hearts When I'm Breathing"". Other than that, the songs all sound the same and don't match the lyrical ellegance of it's predecessor."
3,Can anyone who bought this tell me whether..,"this Hybrid SACD is a single or double disc set? I bought it from a store and it contain only the ""red"" disc. Nothing was mentioned on the package whether it's a single or double or red or green or blue disc. misleading. Thanks."
1,Falling apart after only a month.,Boots are comfortable but I was surprised to see today that a inch square chunk of the sole has broken loose. I only wear these at work as a retail store manager so they are not subjected to any extreme conditions. Very dissapointed.
2,Primary red.,The face of this watch was more on the primary side. It did not have a high quality look to it nor did it have the weight of one.
4,GRRRRRRRRRRREAT!,"This album is a great one! If you are one of those people who like sappy songs about still being in love with the one who broke your heart, you will love this one.. there is one song where it's just the waves crashing onto the shore- really peaceful! Some songs if you understand the meaning may make you cry. If you like folk music with some rock behind it, this album is totally for you! it's NICE!"
4,Almost essential,"While I don't claim to be a Miles Davis expert, I've got about 20 of his albums spanning each one of his various musical 'periods', and as I'm a bit of a purist at heart, I have to admit I favour his more transitional pieces of work, like ""Seven Steps to Heaven"" and ""In a Silent Way"".If you already own ""My Funny Valentine; In Concert"", you may decide you don't need to pay the full import price for this album. Likewise, it's recorded in '64 as is MFV, and reprises both that album's title track and 'All of Me.'I prefer this album however, because of the energy the band derives from the crowd; Miles always got better receptions and appreciation abroad, and you can really tell on this album. It's not perfect; some of the tunes sound a bit rushed, but it still blows away the Carnegie Hall and Plugged Nickle sessions.At the Amazon price, and for only one disc (at just under 40 minutes), I wouldn't recommend it for the casual Miles fan."
4,Fun collection,This collection of corporate cartoons by Dilbert creator Scott Adams is yet another fun look at the business world and the crazy things that go on there. These are well worth reading no matter WHAT your profession!
4,Dilbert rules!,"Do you like Dilbert? If the answer is yes, then buy this book! If the answer is no, then wait till you get a windfall, and buy this book! It's funny, but of course, Dilbert can be an acquired taste."
4,A Good Buy,"This cd is not my all time favorite, but it's very good. Sheryl Crow, changed her look for this album, and it was a smart move. It allowed her to gain new fans, and to keep her music fresh. Although, I don't listen to every track, everytime I listen to this cd, there are some really good ones.My favorites -""Steven McQueen"" - The lryics are not the best for this song, but it's got a good beat, that makes it very catchy.""Soak up the Sun"" - A great tune for the upcoming summer. It will be playing all over the place, like last year. This too, is catchy.""You're an Original"" Another favorite. The chorus is great.""Safe and sound"" I love the chorus, it's my favorite part of the song.""It's so Easy"" It's so easy to like this song.Those are some of my favorites. Although some of the tracks, are fillers. It's still a great buy. And even the filler tracks are pretty good. I don't know if this is Sheryl's best, but it's definitly close."
2,An OK CD,"The bad part about this CD is that she only has 1 really good song, Soak Up The Sun. All of her other songs are well, boring and stupid. Another thing is that her Soak Up the Sun song is everywhere! It's getting kind of annoying.Bottom Line: Not worth paying for"
1,A Poor Imitation,"Ms.Crowe is nothing more than an imitator and opportunist. She hitches a ride on any train that will offer her fame. Never has this been more obvious than on this CD. She stole the title from Mary Chapin Carpenter's far superior effort. Even this CD's artwork is nearly identical to k.d.lang's Invincible Summer, another far superior effort. And I am not even addressing the recycled pop hooks littered throughout. People may be buying into this, but it is time they saw her and her music for what it is and is not. Her own."
5,Best of a Not-So-Great Year,"This isn't Miss Crow's best album, but it is still the best album of the year. There's only one song that is a must-skip. The rest are solid to spectacular."
3,Sheryl still rocks,"Sheryl is talanted, beautiful and has a very nice body for a woman her age. I loved her on the video. I have 3 of Sheryl's albums and regarding this one I have to say that I only loved one song: Soak up the sun. The rest is simply...OK"
2,Disappointing,"I've tried. Lord knows I've tried. But this cd just blows. I can't decide if it's the music or the lyrics. Or could it be both? Sheryl usually rocks my world, but this time out she just fell flat. Maybe turning 40 isn't all t hat cool afterall."
1,Fall from grace...,"Sheryl got better and better with each album, finally blowing my mind with ""The Globe Sessions."" She was *not* the pop queen everyone seems to want to make her out to be. Her true talent lay in folk & blues songwriting, for which her voice is uniquely suited.This album... this album was written by a completely different woman, and it sounds like it was written hurriedly to satisfy a contract obligation. There's no real soul in this album. Following up with that horrid Kid Rock duet didn't restore my faith in her any, either.If you want to know the real Sheryl Crow, get ""Tuesday Night Music Club,"" ""Sheryl Crow,"" or ""The Globe Sessions."" They're infinitely better."
2,I'm Disapointed,"I was always a fan of Sheryl Crow. She had good taste, she worked hard and, above all, wanted a musical evolution. In this record you can expect a kind of ""sell out music""( the first single tells it all). I never expected Sheryl Crow to become a such ""teenager commercial"", almost like the pseudo-pop songs of Britney Spears. Only good to children with less than 17 years old..."
2,Boring,"I am a big fan of Sheryl Crow - but for some reason no album she's done as been as good as ""Tuesday Night Music Club."" This one is incredibly boring and redundant. All of the songs sound the same. Good background music, I suppose."
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"If you loved Sheryl's last two CDs like I did and highly anticipated her latest release, you are in for a huge disappointment.On the way home from buying the CD in a local store, I perused through the tracks in my car only to find a CD comprised of mostly flat, monotonous rhythm and elementary lyrics that are a bore.If a CD could be returned for lack of artistic originality, I would have turned immediately around and taken it back to the store for a refund."
1,MMm..ni modo..se nos vende otra rockera,"Es una lastima anunciar que La Sheryl Crow de ""My Favorite Mistake"" Y del Disco THE GLOBE SESSIONS, Se vendio al pop mas infraganti y meloso como melcocha de mascar. Ya no sabemos si fue por influjo de tocar en los Mtv Video music awards o para sacar mas billete. Ujule...Ya nomas le falta un cover a ""I'm a slave for you"" o que toque con Onda Vaselina o Justin Timberlake.Lastima."
1,It's all over,"Sheryl Crow, in a desperate attempt to recapture her old fan base, hits the gym, dons a halter top, poses for nearly nude photos in a men's magazine, and releases the most flimsy CD of her fun but inconsequential career. Crow can't even perform these songs live--her incredibly lame appearance on ""Late Night with Carson Daly"" proved she can't even reach the notes on her own tunes (Crow sings flat live CONSTANTLY). Crow isn't much of an artist anymore, and she's desperately trying to cling on to her celebrity. What a shame...it's like watching your grandfather fall down a flight of stairs--you can't stop it, but you knew in your heart it was inevitable."
5,Sheryl Rules,Sheryl Rules! Did you see her on Rosie? Just fabulous. The little peep show she gave didn't hurt either.
2,"C'mon, C'mon",I didn't really enjoy this cd at all. I ended up selling my cd. None of the songs were really that good...
3,"good pop, but doesn't rise above the crowd","I'm a huge fan of Sheryl Crow. Her ""Globe Sessions"" and self-titled CDs are masterpieces of effective and varied songwriting (as well as performance), and I can still listen to them over and over without finding them tiresome. No other contemporary female singer/songwriter that I know of is doing anything comparable to these two albums, in my opinion.Having said that, I have to confess that ""C'mon, C'mon"" is, by comparison, fairly ordinary. It's not bad, and I still have it in my player in my car, but it lacks the spark that made EVERY TRACK on the previous two albums extraordinary in my view. Not every album can be equally inspired, and I don't hold that against her. But I do hope that, on future CDs, she will overcome a possible sense of insecurity about her age, and about her place in the contemporary music world, and simply be true to herself and her exceptional songwriting instincts."
2,lacking umpfh,"this one is just a few notches below other cd's of hers that i love (globe sessions, tues...). she just doesn't seem as ""into it"" and the songs all sound alike. also, her voice is a bit different and i don't like it."
1,disgusting,"sheryl crow keep your mouth shut. your hot and all but damn this commercial bus you call music is the worst. your way to hollywood anyway. it sounds like you wrote a soundtrack for and old navy commercial. im sorry your to old to be on mtv so just write something that means something to you so the people that do buy it enjoy it , don't write music that youll trick some airhead teenager into buying and haveing no connection to it. boooo"
1,She get's a ZERO,I am not impressed at all with her last few works of embarrassment. I hope she retires soon. She's a home wrecker and a bad example to the human race.
1,Same o Same o,If you have bought one of her cds you have bought them all. She is past boring. Beside she is unamerican and pro iraq. Dont support her.
1,Boring,This album is a snore! This is a woman that is too stupid to realize that even after 9/11 that war was declared on the United States. She would rather the US be attacked again so she can write some sorry song about it instead of being proactive in protecting itself. A weak album from a misguided person!
2,What happened after the first two tracks???,"I've always been a fan of Sheryl Crow's, so when I heard her new single, I just had to buy the CD. I was feeling rather happy with my choice when listening to the upbeat ""Steve McQueen"" and ""Soak up the Sun"" as the first two tracks... but after that I was left wondering what would make Sheryl record such a lethargic and depressing CD. I'm sorry, but not impressed."
2,What have you people been smoking?,"I don't know what most of these reviewers have been smoking, but this album is, by far, the least compelling of Sheryl Crow's studio albums. Just go back and listen to ""Sheryl Crow"" or ""The Globe Sessions."" The differences are stark and obvious. I hope she snaps out of it with her next album. Hey Sheryl, lose all of the guest vocalists and get back to the gutsy writing of the previous two albums. As far as I am concerned, this album is fluff. Use it as a ninja frisbee."
1,Frustratingly Disappointing,"This album has been referred to as the sunnier counterpart to Crow's moodier epynomous second album, but _C'mon C'mon_ falls so short that no comparision can even be made. Frankly, it would be difficult to call _C'mon C'mon_ an album at all; it is filled with episodic duets ( with Lenny Kravitz, Stevie Nicks, Don Henley, etc) that showcase more Crow's popularity among her peers than any of the musical gusto she projected on her previous albums. Indeed, Crow sounds like a guest musician on her own tribute album: her trademark irony has been replaced with inane and frustrating lyrics. Admittingly, Crow's albums have never been consummate masterpieces, this can be easily excused, but this album is beyond all condonation. I cannot warn more strongly against the purchase of this album."
3,"Three classic tracks, overall not my favorite Crow album","C'Mon C'mon has three of my favorite Sheryl Crow songs - Steve McQueen, Soak Up The Sun, and the title track. However, as a whole album it's not her best. I recommend Tuesday Night Music Club, her self-titled, Wildflower, and Detours before this CD. But if you are a big fan, those three tracks plus the rocker You're An Original make this one you need in your collection eventually."
1,C'mon this thing is embarassing,"C'mon...C'mon... already. This album is too long, too slow, has too many ballads and too many dang string arrangements. I consider myself a Sheryl Crow fan and believe her previous albums are wonderful, even brilliant. But this thing has to be the smarmiest album I've bought/listened to in years. It's both rythmically and lyrically uninteresting. Too bad. Don't waste your money."
2,Typical Sheryl Crow album with 1 or 2 good songs on it,"""Steve McQueen"" rocks... the rest of the album? ... I'd buy that single and wait for her Greatest Hits album to come out. Or better yet download her best songs. Soak Up The Sun is okay but the lyrics are sophmoric, ""I've got noone to blame and everytime I feel lame I'm looking up."" ... And give us some more exciting people to collaborate with- Stevie Nicks sounds like a billy goat and she has turned Kid Rock into a pansy. ""Steve McQueen"" however- is Crow at her best. ... At one point thugh she vocalizes her obsession with her fear of being 40 and having to compete with sexy sassy 21 year old singers, i.e. ""We've got rock stars in the white house and all our pop stars look like porn"". [...] But still thanks to that song I didn't feel like a total fool for buying this album- that one line kind of ruins it though."
5,"Sheryl Crow: C'mon, C'mon","i dig everything about this record, from the music, to the cool A NIGHT AT THE PLAYBOY MANSION-style font. i wouldn't wanna imagine how dissapointed i'd be if this record were a sham, but it's been clear from her first record that sheryl crow is too good for that. really too good.the record's first track, steve mcqueen, kicks things off in fine shape. the only thing i really know about steve mcqueen is that he was name-checked by some awkward girl on the television show, 7th heaven. that not withstanding, the next song, soak up the sun, is the first single dropped from the album. finally i have the pleasure of hearing the song that my friends with vh1 have all been bragging about- .the rest of the album is equally great, packed with loud guitars, sweet vocals, and all-around great summer rock. i'd go into some detail about the unusual juxstaposition between the lyrics and the music, but i've got a college application burning a hole in my desk. do yourself a favor..."
1,No Good,"I bought this album for the song, ""Soak Up The Sun"" and it ended up that that was the only song I would like on this album. I think most of the songs are a little stupid and poorly written. Save your money. I ended up giving the CD away because I never wanted to listen to it."
1,Stupid fad of the 90's Lives On,"The aqua net hair bands of the 80's died swiftly when the 90's hit; not so with the ""anti-hair bands"" of the 90's. The legions of un-glamorous lead singers strumming acoustic guitars are alive and well.Indeed, Sheryl Crowe is the embodiment of that 1990's stereotype; her music encourages people to enjoy the ""simple life,"" though she prefers the life of a multimillionaire.Yes, the classic hypocrosy that defined music of the 1990's is coming through loud and clear in Crowe's latest album. Crowe has a ""communist friend"" whose gas she can't afford. She sells millions of records but can't put gas in her car, see. She loves her impoverished way of life, and ecourages us to love it too.She preaches to us, saying ""It's not getting what you want/ It's wanting what you've got."" Apparently Ms. Crowe thinks that complacency is the answer. Is that how you got your multimillion dollar record deal, Cheryl?"
2,Yawns Abound,"Sheryl Crow is one of the most renowned popular singer/songwriters around. I have never really enjoyed any of her previous work, but I gave this one an unbiased fair shot.It's cotton candy. There are some really catch tunes here: 'Soak Up the Sun,' 'Steve Mcqueen,' 'You're an Original.' The problem is that this very little musical or lyrical substance to any of it.Crow is indicative of what the mainstream music industry has become. She churns out an album every few years and feigns to know what it's like to be an ordinary joe on the street in her pseudo-confessional style. She may not be ordinary but this music sure is."
2,What happened to her voice!,"There was a day when Sheryl Crow could belt out Rhiannon and Rock On Golden Woman real good or even that freedom song from the white album. I liked her when she recorded the Sunset song. something about being in california if i remember clearly. But now all of a sudden she's putting on ears and leaves her gravelly voice behind. Now she's pretending to be a pop singer, it's just not sounding good at all, in britney style. she used to sing out rock song now she's into Britney style song. and her voice change. i feel betrayed cuz she didn't keep it real. voices carry from til tuesday was her best album. but that's just my opinion. hope this helps :)"
5,Good buy!,I have played this CD in my car continuously for weeks! I'm surprised I haven't worn it out yet. I highly recommend it.
4,A good album,"I must admit that I put off buying this album for a long while since the song ""Steve McQueen"" didn't appeal to me at all when I heard it on the radio. On the other hand I really enjoy ""Soak up the Sun"".I have bought to many CDs with only two good songs on them, so I stayed away from this CD until I had a chance to listen to most of the songs on the album.This is a solid album. Track 11 - ""Lucky Kid"" is the song that rocks the most on this CD. Track 5 - ""It's so Easy"" is a great duet with Don Henley. Overall it is a very mellow album.This album seems to be another confirmation that artists write better songs when they are poor and pissed off. The quality of their work seems to taper off after they have alot of money in their bank account. Hopefully, Sheryl Crow will have something that brings her back to the level of her self titled album."
4,sheryl crow new album,i liked the new album espically the first half. It is the perfect summer album. I really liked the song c'mon c'mon a song sherly sings with Stevie Nicks it is very good with a upbeat rock meoldy. Of course i like soak up the sun the perfect outdoor summer song. Also I like Steve McQueen the first song on the cd. The only thing i would of liked better is if she had ended the cd on a more happier note Weather Channel is a beautiful song but it kind of left me depressed. Overall I really liked the cd I have listen to it at least 4 times since getting it yesturday.
4,Crow - C'mon C'mon,"Not being a Sheryl Crow fan, I was somewhat surprised when I found myself purchasing it, but I'd recently heard Steve McQueen so how could I resist? And I was pleasantly surprised - most of the album is quite good. Laden with guest vocalists, the album is a great listen. I only find fault in two areas. First, the production is such that its difficult to differentiate Crow's backing vocals from those of the many guests. Second, what's up with the Soak Up The Sun song? This has got to be one of the single dumbest, mind-numbing songs to come along in years. I'd heard it on the radio several times but never fully appreciated the depth of its stupidity. Lucky for us, the remainder of the album is much, much better."
3,Where is the Sheryl we know? This isn't her.,"I've been a fan of Sheryl's for some time now, and have seen her in concert a few times. Bottom line, she knows how to rock. There are not very many female rockers who can pull this off in modern times. I ran out and bought her new album the day it came out. I was very dissappointed. It seems she quit rocking, and gave in to the big-money record company's push for the radio-playlist-friendly bubblegum pop, built to compete with the other awful radio artists of today (what happened to radio, anyhow?). Bring the rockin' edge back, and quit immitating the rap stars by bringing 20 gueststars to hold your hand while you sing (that is a bad trend I hope goes away soon). If you want to hear the essence of Sheryl, buy her older stuff. It's much better."
4,C'MON Finds Crow Rocking Out,"With the exception of her sophomore effort, Sheryl Crow's records are more often that not distinguished by some strong singles('Leaving Las Vegas','My Favorite Mistake'), with the rest filled out by largely average material. C'MON C'MON finds her improving greatly on the vastly overrated THE GLOBE SESSIONS,padding the set with more hooks than any of her previous records,and rocking with abandon on many of its' tracks. First single 'Soak Up The Sun', though fairly catchy, offers up her most meaningless lyrics since 'All I Wanna Do'--Crow showcases herself to far better effect on such tracks as 'You're An Original','Hole In My Pocket', and the albums' best cut 'Lucky Kid'. Much like Stevie Nicks' recent album, Crow also brings in a ton of guest vocalists, with only Don Henley making any real mark on the sappy ballad 'It's So Easy'. Nevertheless, this stands as Crow's most consistent set next to her second effort."
2,"C'mon C'mon, you can do better than this","i've seen sheryl crow perform live before and she is a far more talented musician than is reflected in this record. the best track is the one you're hearing constantly on the radio, which is a catchy but far from excellent song. i had high expectations given some of the early reviews of the album and the collaborations with many artists i am fans of, but the much discussed duet with lenny falls short as do most of the other duets. i think two stars is actually generous. by way of comparison, this album pales in comparison to emmy lou harris' recent album, red dirt girl."
2,Lazy Days...Lazy Work,"A true avid SC fan am I but what's this [stuff]? Sheryl has never been the most perceptive songwriter, depending more on cliches and formulas that have worked in the past, but I can't believe the mediocrity of these [stinky]songs! Safe and Sound alone is totally undecipherable ""maybe this is forver/forever fades away like a rocket ascending into space."" Huh? I've read better words in high school literary magazines. This is mindless drivel and if it had been done by a lesser-known artist it would be in the dollar bins by now. The plethora of artists ""helping out"" is a gimmicky attempt to sell the album and make up for lack of originality; the overblown ballads are a big yawn; and she must have been pretty desperate for material to rehash ""It's Only Love."" Some brigt spots - the glam rocker ""Lucky Kid"", the soulful ""Weather Channel"" and ""You're an Original"" the only song with a trace of Sheryl's ""sweet sneer"""
2,not her too!,"It seems like alot of bands are chaning their old styles and ways to compete for top 40 radio play and to sell more records. This album without a doubt is her most poppy yet and has taken the path so many have taken these past couple months- like No Doubt, the Cranberries, etc. the new single ""Soak up the Sun"" is a great example, as it is one of her most happy radio-friendly singles to come out, probably ever from her. The rest of the album is composed of simple lyrics and lack the depth of what we are used to, like from her greatest album ""The Globe Sessions"". The rest of the album just sounds like pop pap... overall i was waiting for this record because we have come to set the bar high for miss Sheryl Crow- and she just turned 40 but she isnt really acting her age in the music. This sounds like a debut record."
1,Soak up... a different album,"When I bought this CD, I was a big fan of ""Soak Up the Sun"". But after listening to it twice, it got boring. All of the songs on this CD are way too sugary. Sheryl is trying to get her popularity back by trying to become Britney Spears."
2,One hit album,"I bought this album due to the song ""Soak up the sun"". I was dissappointed when it was the only good song on the cd. I still believe Sheryle Crow keeps it real(Just not on this album)."
2,What Tha?,"That's what I said when I listened to the whole cd. Now, ""Soak Up the Sun"" is cute, granted. It's got the hit formula down. ""Steve McQueen"" hits the mark, but the rest - C'MON, Sheryl. I actually had to get out the old stuff and listen to remember why I like this girl. Yes, she is good, but this collection is not her best - it's formula pop and to me, that is the death knell. I owned this one - notice I say ""owned."" I gave it away after I heard the line, ""You're an original, Baby,"" once too many times."
2,Mediocre,"This is my least favorite Sheryl Crow album. She did too many collaborations and lost her sound. Steve McQueen and the Weather Channel sound like Crow, but the rest is just manufactured pop."
3,I like this but I've heard this all before,"Sheryl Crow is definitely not an original. She is a great imitator. Techinically this album does everything right, but like usual with any Sheryl Crow CD, it does not make you feel. I like her choice of heros-Henley, Nicks, Harris, but she is not yet in their class."
2,dont waste your money!,"What a waste of money! sheryl has always been one of my favorate female singer, for many reasons. the main resaon is that she is a hot chick who plays gautar and does not sing fluffy pop hits. As for this cd in my mind its all fluffy pop hits geared to geting a younger people to buy it. only thing I liked was the video for ""soak up the sun"" but the song lyrics need work really bad. the other song people seem to like is ""Steve Mcqueen"" but it is very forgetable just like the song on the cd. dont buy this buy the 93 release ""Tuesday Night Music Club"" its a way better cd."
3,wait a second,"is it just me, or are all her songs except ""Soak up the Sun"" just repeating the same line over and over again?! it gets a little annoying."
1,Sunshine Lobotomy,"I LLLLLLLUUUUUUUUVVVVVV Sheryl Crow...I Detest this album.She seems to have completely relinquished her depth, articulation, irony, and artistry to release a mediocre collection of rushed fillers. What is going on? She has so much power. So much ability. She can, and has altered mind-sets and points of view, raised politcal and social awareness, and asked the world to take a look in the proverbial pond reflection, smoke a cig and laugh. NOW it's a bunch of subjective self centered incoherent babble that is not worthy of a true Crow fan's hard earned duckets. This album is in short Dry, lazy, and flamboyantly uninspired. For once this lyrical genious has ABSOLUTELY NOTHIN' TO SAY! No wonder 3 of the only attempted songs are at the very beginning...This is a mid-life crisis set to music!... C'mon C'mon Sheryl!she needs to lock herself in her house and put her second album on repeat for a good month or two...that'll snap her out of it."
2,A Few Good Songs,"Sheryl Crow definitely did not put all of her effort into this album. The only songs I find good are (in order of ""goodness"") Steve Mcqueen, Soak Up The Sun, Diamond Road, and Safe And Sound. The rest of the album is so blah and mediocre it is painful to sit through. Her 2nd is definitely her best effort and this one is behind her first album which I thought could have been a little more crafted better. Anyway, there is always the future for Sheryl to redeem her music and talent."
5,THIS IS ONE GOOD ALBUM,"I have every other Sheryl Crow album, and I love all of them, The Globe Sessions being my favorite. When I heard ""Soak Up The Sun"" on the radio, I was really surprised, I didn't think that it was her type of song, however I bought the album because I know my favorite songs on her previous albums are songs that never made it to radio (Home, Maybe Angels, Hard To Make A Stand-from ""Sheryl Crow"", Riverwide, It Don't Hurt, Mississippi (my fav)from ""The Globe Sessions"") So, needless to say ""Soak Up the Sun"" became my least favorite song on the album. Every other song is great, with the exception of ""Lucky Kid"" I have it in my CD player, I keep listening to it over and over. I really recommend it to all Sheryl Crow fans. My favorites on the album are ""C'mon C'mon"", ""Abilene"", ""It's Only Love"", ""Hole In My Pocket"", and I absolutely LOVE ""Diamond Road"" But, really, the entire album is a pleasant listening experiece."
2,A bit on the surupy side,"C'mon C'mon is a lighter album that the Globe Sessions, and I really didn't like most of the sappy lyrics, and boring progressions. I still like her as an artist, but this album will probably be seeing more shelf time than the others.There are a few interestingh tracks, but not enough of them pull this album into a decent 3 star rating.Buy the Globe Sessions before you buy this one if you don't already have it -- even skip this one and hope she gets back that edge she lost somewhere."
2,I Say A Change Won't Do You Good,"My feelings about the C'mon C'mon album are that it is notwhat I was hoping for. I honestly cannot find a single track that I care to listen to more than one time on this album withthe exception of the song ""Soak in the Sun."" And this song is not at all representative of the musical style of the rest of thealbum. The songs are not catchy on this one nor are they memorable. Her new style is just not fun. Her mood and lyrics are melancholy. This album may be for you if you are into thesound of the classic rock and roll era. You might consider getting this album then. However, I think that you ought to listen to this album before you go out and buy it because it is very different in style than her previous work. This one is made for classic rock fans and not for many pop music fans such as me."
5,3 years well spent,"Sheryl Crowe spent 3 years on this Album. And I think she did swell. Adding other singers to her CD was a good idea.The song ""Safe & Sound"" is a very heart moving and goose bumping song. I found this song better than ""Soak up the Sun"".This is my first Sheryl Crowe CD and dont think I waysted a single penny on it. This CD will be great for road trips and just singing out loud in your car."
4,great quality...,great quality compared to my prior keychains that have fallen apart... didn't rate it a full 5 stars only because the price with shipping was a bit pricey...
5,Great present for my friend!,I chose this album as a present for a friend to collect photos of her new house. She loved it!
5,Remarkable,"What a collection of little gems. Robert Louis Stevenson is justly remembered for novels like Treasure Island and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but he was also a master of the essay. These dozen short works are a delight. Whether taking us on a transcontinental railroad journey, introducing us to the artists' colony of Fontainebleau (""The art of words and not a desire to publish new discoveries, the love of form and not a novel reading of historical events, mark the vocation of the writer and the painter.""), or meditating on man's place in the universe, Stevenson combines lyrical, descriptive prose with a keen eye for detail. He can rhapsodize about nature, and then skewer man's cruelty or hypocrisy. It makes for writing you'll want to return to again and again."
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.,"I am a dedicated fan of Indian spiritiual music and I HATED this CD. The voices have a very depressing intonation, and all the chants are slow and lethargic, more like a dirge. ...If you like Indian-style music, order Krishna Das tapes. Or ""The Divine Gypsy"" from Self-Realization Fellowship, for deeply spiritual, soothing music."
3,"OK, but desperately needs an update","This is a very comprehensive overview of all the details that a prospective assistant editor should be aware of.But the field of digital editing has changed tremendously since the book was last updated in 1999, and I found the sections on digital editing dated to the point of being useless.Hopefully the author will update the book soon to include current processes for telecine and handling digital film and audio sources."
3,Hopelessly dated,"As this book currently stands it is hopelessly outdated and not even remotely relevant to modern editors. While some of the information presented is interesting, it offers little to an assistant editor who is seeking to know what to expect in an editing room past 2006. This book was last updated in 1999 and that should give you some indication of how out of date it is. Too much has changed in the past 10 years for this book to be helpful, I sincerely hope the author updates it as it is well written. However as it stands I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is an editor getting into the industry today."
4,Different from the newer blinker albums..,"This album is a lot more rock than the newer blinker the star albums. It has hints of nirvana in many of the songs. Kind of a later grunge album I guess. The lyrics are a little wierd (they don't really make alot of sense), but overall I like this cd. The guitar riffs are raw and the songs are catchy. My favorite song off here is ""Soldier 3""."
1,Complete Waste of Money,This is a short 1/2 page article with a list. It is not worth $5.95. I would not recommend the purchase.
5,Fun And Educational!,My 5 yr old and I play this together. He loves the different options in games and the challenges. It has introduced new words and showed him how to use them.
5,great read,"A stunning work. I couldn't put it down. Gripping yet oddly soothing. I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me. A epic work rivaling the likes of the Great Gatsby. A nail bitting page turner. Buy this book."
2,Not a durable toy!,"I echo what another reviewer wrote. I have two boys who needed this toy as part of their occupational therapy. The frames are just not durbale and bent up in no time, causing the tent and house to be wildly misshapen. Am currently online looking for replacement frames... which is proving quite challenging! The boys do still play in the tube, they actually have it out right now... But for the money, you can just get the tube seperate and buy a better house/tent to play in. Just my two cents."
2,Fun While It Lasted,"Our triplet toddlers had a blast in the Mambo Combo playset. The only problem was that the tent and clubhouse lasted a grand total of two days before tent poles in each of them snapped in half, leaving both hopelessly warped. I searched the internet for over an hour looking for replacement parts, with no luck! What's the point? The turn-around on the replacement parts (if you can find them) will take at least a week, and the thing will be broken again shortly after replacing the broken pieces anyway. This playset is not durable enough for toddlers and not big enough for older kids. If you can purchase the tunnel that would be the way to go. The tunnel is fun and the only durable item in this set. Save your money and skip the Mambo Combo."
2,"My son learned the word ""flimsy""",This is an extremely flimsy and poorly built product. None of the parts stay together long enough to actually be enjoyed by the kids. I would not recommend this product until they put some more thought into making it stronger.
2,"Great Idea, Didn't last","Well we got this for our kids 2nd birthday.The clubhouse poles were too long and we could not get the fabric to fit over it.The tent went together easily but it was irreparably broken in multiple places in 10 mins. My kids did love it, and we are tying to find replacement poles."
2,No replacement parts!!,"My kids love this tent and tunnel set, but when we lost a couple of the pieces when we moved, and one of the frame sections snapped in half, I was extremely disappointed to find out they don't sell replacement parts! If you lose some pieces or they get cracked and damaged as ours have, the tent is useless. We now have a tent and a teepee we can't use. They still enjoy the tunnels, but I'm so mad they don't sell replacement parts. I know we're not the only family that needs them!"
1,Destroyed within hours of set up,"My four small children destroyed the tents within just a couple of hours of set up. ""Flimsy"" is putting it mildly. Now I see why it was so much less expensive than other tents. Now I have to get something else anyway and I spent about $2 per minute of fun. Waste of money."
1,Not Durable,"My son got so excited when we started putting the tent together, (it was hard to do it), I broke 3 poles, and now I'm trying to find some replacments, I'been looking for the website but no luck. Plastic is cheap and not durable (not made for kids) my son is only 2yo and he is able to bend them easly, ..... I dont't recomend to spend your money in this product"
4,Worth the money for a while,"I have two children, 3 and 1.5 years. While the plastic frames bent after a while, the tent and tunnels have been well worth the money. They lasted about 1.5 years before they got bent, which I think is pretty good for 2 active toddlers. I figure most toys don't last that long for kids that age. The tunnels have shown almost no wear, and I was actually looking for another version of the same brand since we liked the quality of the fabric on this one."
3,"They are not what I ordered, and it seems Mediums are hard to find","Ok,When I ordered this item it was not labled ""Fast Flow,"" it was labled ""Medium Flow.""So I was a little suprised when I got a bunch of fast flow nipples for our VentAire Wide bottles.As it turns out, its almost impossible to find Medium flow nipples for the VentAire system.Interestingly, the Playtex DROP-INS Medium nipples DO work with the VentAire Wide bottles, and those are what need if you get the switcharoo like we did.Considering these nipple was drop shipped from Playtex directly (or at least the sole vendor for them), I would have expected to get what I ordered. I do find it VERY odd that they corrected the product after I placed the order. (I have to the emails verifying what I ordered...)So, if you have an older infant can that use rapid nipples and not drown, these are for you. Otherwise, be the DROP-INs medium nipple, and use those. The are IDENTICAL to the VenAire nipples."
1,Do not buy these from The Natural Health Shoppe,"Product is advertised for the Advanced Playtex VentAire bottles; however, if you order from The Natural Health Shoppe they send old stock from the Bubble Free System. Packaging is yellowed with age. Gross! Plus, they refuse to refund shipping and will make returning difficult in general. The Playtex VentAire Advance System is wonderful but the nipples advertised here are not. Buy elseware!"
3,"caught, after a while...","In the beginning I had a hard time getting in to the story. But after a while I was caught by the story as well as by the fresh narrative talent of the author. Poetic, light, down to earth, funny and basic at the same time. Some parts ofthe story could have been expanded though. And what happened to dear Miss Johnie? I'll always wonder."
2,"Once bitten, twice shy","This melodramatic tale of an inner city family with aspirations to hobnob with the black creme de la creme is not only unmoving, tragic, and rehashed; it is also tactlessly written. The author , no doubt, has captured the plight of thousands of Blacks that live within inner cities yet who strive for lifes pleasantries. What occurs in this novel, however, is a sad depiction of self-loathnig by the father, shameless abuse, and the demeaning of the Black church. A more appropriate title for this book would probably be hell on earth: a silent plea for salvation."
3,Only twice Ive wished for Prozac: A review,"This novel was so depressing that I was bummed out for a week after reading it. I feel the author did not develope many of the issues she presented. From the book jacket, I expected, a tragady that sparked riots leading to down trodded people taking a stand to recalm their community, boy was I wrong. Many of the main ""shockers"" of the book just passed you by as minor details. Don't get me wrong I think the author has great potential, but it was not nurtured in the project"
5,Great Book,"Well kept book and delivered as promised! I will definitely order from this person again, as I know that I will get exactly what I expect. My husband will love it, thank you"
4,The Ring of Rings,"Musashi manages to fit into about 100 pages the perspective of Oriental thinking. He works out a system which is a considerable oracale. All is one to him and this is, although sometimes hard to recognize, his vehicle of success. One with the eastern philosophy of natural order Musashi puts into a very small literature a heart of iron and a spirit of fire. Maybe he will be refined yet."
3,"Recommended, but poor editing.....","This was a pretty decent read and I am happy to include it in my library. While I rate the 'Code of the Samurai' and the 'Art of War' on a much higher level, this book is not without it's merits.I haven't read other translations, so I can't really comment on the quality of this one. However, the introductory material suffered from quite a few mistakes. Commas were missed, the improper use of a/an was found at least once and even the word 'then' was misspelled. This wouldn't be allowed in a college term paper; it should have been caught in a mass market publication.As to the quality of the book for it's knowledge alone, I would break it down by who the prospective reader is:Kendo Artist: This is a must. No ifs, ands or buts.Other Martial Artist: Highly recommended, but not necessary.Soldier: Recommended, but take it with a grain of salt.Businessperson: Read it only if you are curious."
3,Samurai Instructions,"Well, its OK. This book is short and not what I expected. If your interested in precisely and exactly how to sword fight then this book can help. I guess it has some historical interest in Japan."
4,Makes you think!,I needed this for an essay I had to write. It is an awesome book used to teach you how to use important skills needed to become successful at your job and life.
5,One of the better texts for management as well as combat,"This book is one of the best texts for new managers (along with the Art of War and The Prince) to give a general coverage of the manipulation and assessment of situations and people. It is couched as a series of letters describing swordplay during the time of the Shogunate, but its topical coverage applies to almost any interpersonal interaction."
2,Not Sun Tzu,"There is nothing that you can possibly gain from this book that you cant from The Art of War. It is not a fun read, and if your goal is to apply it to business or any other walk of life, you will only be able to do so loosely. Read Sun Tzu, read Machiavelli, but dont read this. Im glad I didnt buy it.A 2 because, like 5's I dont give out 1's except rarely. Im sure that the book was well regarded in ancient Japan, but it is useless to our era."
4,eternal,"This book cannot be adequately evaluated or appreciated in a single reading or even ten. It is the attempt to relate the life-experience of a man who was super-human by today's standards. Read it. Wait a year. Read it again. Repeat process as necessary. This book can help you deal with any situation life can throw at you, if you can comprehend the content and apply it properly."
5,Still very relevant.,"This is a book on the Way of the warrior, or rather the Ways to achieve victory through intelligence and focus. Musashi describes the five Ways of swordsmanship, as being essential to the good Samurai. It is both amusing and fascinating to realize, modern day business owners rely heavily on the wisdom of a man who wrote this over 400 years ago. But, I suppose that just proves it truly is wisdom, that will last. Though this book may seem strange to those, who haven't read it, you learn stuff from it, after a while. So, it's worth it!"
4,Useful insights by a Samurai who died....by aging(!),"Miyamoto Musashi lived in the medium age Japan, among wars and social crises. The kind of life he had led him to develop a special philosophy (and very practical) towards work, discipline, fears and the trascending questions. His life can't be an practical example for us NOW. We don't live in societies where war is the main way of living (fortunately), but, and this is an important BUT, his insights about living in the middle of a noncooperative relations (dangerous ones, i would say), the moral and psichological resources everyone has to survive, and the basic practices to develop the capabilities to it, are valuables for every modern person, for the new environment we have ahead (job place, market, personal competition for excellence), what is as competitive as the Japan he lived (but less bloody). Indeed, being capable to compete supposes a Samurai style planning and training capabilites. Read what one of them advices to us."
4,A classic of military theory,"Musashi's treatise on combat is, in many places, a rather dry recitation on footwork. But it is also, in many places, a thoughtful critique of traditions that serve no practical purpose in real life, and the need to experiment, to learn, and to embrace those ideas or skills that allow you to truly succeed in real life. Not the most engaging or accessible text, but very interesting and fairly short."
4,Spirit of Zen,This is actually a great book on practical Zen in a way of swordmanship in medieval Japan. Two heaven sword tehnique is described there but it is difficult to understand for people who doesn't use to martial art.
2,Nahhh!,"I studied martial arts when I was younger, karate to be exact, and at times you had to really reach to get into the Zen of the discipline. As a Christian American, you would need to study at length to fully grasp the nuances. This book is interesting on one level, however one dimentional. The most difficult aspect of this book is it's extremely vague and, at times, utterly bad translations that appear to make no sense at all. What's worse is that the author apparently expects you to except it anyway! Can I get a proofreader? Good luck."
3,Repetitive rings,Fairly simplistic thoughts repeated frequently.Guess it works for a young swordsman!Did not do a hell of a lot for me.
2,"Good book, poor version","""th way of the sword"", The entire book is riddled with spelling mistakes such as these.A friend of mine lent me another version of this book a few months ago, I really enjoyed it. I decided to buy my own copy due to the excellent material presented within.This copy however is overall poorly translated, and very badly written.Many sentences make no grammatical sense, the translator chose a lot of English words that do not do justice to the piece, every page has at least one obvious spelling mistake.Overall a very poor job from whomever was entrusted with making an English version of this book. Had I not already read a far superior version I would have been stuck trying to piece words together and figure out what the h**l is going on."
4,Strategic Thoughts Applicable to Your Life,"As I read the first twenty pages, I couldn't help but to say,""Whooah?""And because martial arts principles are valuable to me, I expected something new about life principles.What I found is that this book requires a deep and unique level of thinking how ways of the sword can apply to all aspects of ones life.While this isn't a book that I'd advise someone to rush to buy, to enchance their life, it is a resource to guide the reader to slowly evolve in ways that become truly part of their subconscious being."
4,I used it as a comparitive tool,I was doing research into comparing and contrasting christian and eastern lterature. I used this text as a tool to see how the basic underlying of both the christian and eastern philosophies are quite similar in ways of self-control and controlling your own environment and impacting your environment. I found the text both interesting and challenging. A good source for basis eastern philosophical study and understanding.
5,A Book of Five Rings,My son said he has always wanted this book and will more likley read it over and over. He is a person who loves to read and keeps books he like to read again and again.
3,Over Hyped,"There's no doubt this book is an interesting read, from which one can learn a lot. But attributing the infinite wisdom of the most successful people today to this book is an overly pretentious act, for after all, this is a book explaining how to best cut your opponent with a long sword.If it is ancient wisdom you are after, I would recommend the Hagakure and The Art of War much more than this one. But if you're interested in learning the roots of Japanese culture, then the Book of Five Rings will do just fine."
2,"Interesting historical read, poor commentary....","This book is interesting to read for it's historical merits. I would also imagine practitioners of the sword arts would find this a highly prized text.The commentary, however, could have been a lot better. I also think this text is pretty overrated as a business manual. How or why this would apply to the business arena is difficult to ascertain. There are better sources for inspiration in my opinion."
3,Overlooked typos,"It's awkward to receive a book so well packaged which has typos from the backcover, to the flaps and the last page. I will never buy another book by this publisher."
2,"Dry, series of events without the emotion","I am reading many books with full-figured heroines and stumbled across this book.It is a dull and dry telling of a series of events. It failed in stirring up any emotions really.I got the feeling it is the telling of one of those TV movies that want to be all emotional, but the story line is lacking in true suspense."
2,"flat, tedious, predictable","while not an awful book, neither was it good. There was very little description, and what there was was fery perfunctory and dry. The conversations were formal, using no slang or idioms, in other words not the way people talk. You are never given a clear idea of what the heroine looks like. Since she's hung up on her weight, it's kind of germaine to the plot! Is she a size 12 or a size 20? I wanted to know! There is a pretty laughable drug smuggling plot point, and no one seems to have a cell phone, much less a computer. The story seems to have a contempory setting, so some technology would be expected. The hero loves the heroine, but why? Just because of the way she looks? This is a very simple, VERY chaste love story, and it would be suitable for those who don't want sex in their stories, young teens, or a more mature tween. I had hoped for more passion, and much more depth and character development. I doubt I'll read any more by this author.KesterGayle"
4,Good Quality for the money,"I purchased this product and compared it with other SIP phones of similar price. [$70-$120]. Featuring a truly simple web-based configuration, I didn't need to read any documentation except to find the default password to get this phone up and running with my small < 50 users Asterisk (using freePBX) deployment.The audio quality is excellent, and the construction feels solid as well.If you need extensive features, you will have to spend more on a different model, but if you just need a simple 1 line IP phone on a budget this is a great fit."
2,Unimpressed,"I bought this phone hoping for a reasonably priced SIP phone to use with my Asterisk box at home. I was unimpressed with this item. First, the screen is NOT backlit like the Cisco/Linksys manual states. I'm using it in a fairly dark area and really need the backlit display. However, the biggest problem was that I experienced one-way audio with all incoming calls. I've set up quite a few SIP phones and am quite familiar with the ""one-way audio problem"" as it relates to NAT (network address translation). However, all of my test calls were on a local network. No NAT was involved. I have several SIP hard phones and soft phones installed with no one-way audio problems at all. I gave it two stars because it feels like a solid phone and reminds me a lot of the higher-end Cisco phone I have on my desk at work. The phone has been returned and I'll pick out a different brand."
4,Inspired by the very best.,"What if The Marvelous 3 met Kiss in a dark alley and decided to rock up some Cheap Trick tunes until they sounded like Twisted Sister? The result is Millions - Million Dollar Rock.Its hard to decribe their style which someone once put as ""Ultra-catchy, guitar-rock/power-pop/retro fusion..."". The title track alone is worth every cent paid, although songs like ""I Want You"" ""Heather"" and ""Today is the day"" give it some good competition.Just buy it and thank me later."
2,Solid but not memorable,"Sade is back!! Her lyrics are solid and the music is wonderful yet the union does not illuminate the soul as her previous work has done. Her pinnacle work was indeed Love Deluxe. That album exceeded all expecations. Her songs contained the same amount of sadness as her present work yet they stirred the listener and revealed a sense of hope.Lover's rock does have memorable cuts, All about our love, The king of sorrow, and The Sweetest Gift. However, some tracks are too drum and base heavy and drown out the lyrics.The live cd will illuminate the listener as to what the current songs lack. The fire and passion has fizzled and her heartache overwhelms the material. The songs lulled me yet they had no direction. Her voice is beautiful, the instrumentation is excellent but overall this cd is not is memorable."
5,If You Loved Her Then You'll Love Her Now,"Seductively simple and oh so beautiful. Not the kind of tunes that will jump out at you, but if you're looking for Depth, you'll find it in this CD."
4,Sade continues to sing music to my ears..,"I've been listening to Sade since her debut and she never ceases to amaze me with wonderful vocals. From start to finish, each of her CD's tells a series of stories that anyone who's been in love can relate to. Her voice captures all those emotions and lulls you into that 'special' place in your heart. Sade will always be a part of my music collection."
5,wow,"this cd is probably my favorite since ""stronger than pride"". not only does sade have an amazing voice, but her songs also have great lyrics. i love this cd."
4,Play this when you are tired of silence,"This sound is very light and the result is euphoric, almost. When you don't really want to hear music or silence, put this on. When you're tired or attempting to relax."
3,"Never as good as the first, second, third and fourth time.","Okay, I've given myself several months to warm up to this cd and it's not really happening. Hard and uneasy best describes the feeling of this Sade release. It's almost as if Sade wanted to create a cd that would take years to grow on people, and I think many people are kidding themselves when they say this is her best. If this had been her first cd, it would have not made a very favorable impression on me. What happened to the rhythm? What happened to the flow? What happened to that smooooth Sade sound? All of it pretty much abandoned on ""Lovers Rock"". Three stars is a bit generous."
1,what is this,this cd is bad i cant beleive i got this cd all the songs are so bad why did she become a singer she sucks big time sade get a beter vocie this cd is the worst cd i ever got in my hoie life so do me a faver in dont buy this cd
2,THIS IS REALLY BAD,"I like Sade. I don't like this disc. There are three songs I really love. You can throw the rest of this out. Sade sounds great. The songs are bad and the accompanying music is awful. This is Sade with a drum machine. The songs don't even have enough to allow her to put them over. The first song is Country and Western Sade. Not flattering to her at all. I can't really express how bad this is. I do not compare discs to other discs the performer puts out. This disc stands on its own. It is bad music by itself. If you like Sade, don't buy this. You won't like it. She is forcing herself to sing this stuff and is very uninterested in what she is singing. I don't blame her."
3,Rock & Squeek,An otherwise lovely album ruined by the scratches and squeeks of the guitar. These noises are all too common in other albums but I have never found them to be quite as distracting and overwhelming as they are on this one.
2,"So Sad, Sade","Long awaited, but not surprising. With the growing numbers of artists that have tried to re-ignite the fire that drove them to fame and fortune in the late 80's and early 90's, this effort falls far short of what we've expected from Sade.Sadly, fans have waited 8 years for this release, and not doubt they will buy it, as I did. However, the album lacks all the depth, originality and feel that has defined Sade over the past albums that were so great.Drum machines, bland melodies, and rough production have created a sad, and probably last, effort from from our lady Helen. Too bad, so sad."
2,NOT HER BEST!,"Sade has been out of the loop for 8 years...and it shows on this CD.The only song that got my attention was ""Immigrant"".""Lover's rock"" was unmoving and whiny.The whole cd sounded bland,uncaptivating,depressing, and uninspired...like it was rushed to be put out there for the fans to feast on.Yuck! What a dissapointment!and a waste of money.""Stronger than pride"" was my best Sade album by far,This one doesn't even measure up!"
3,find a guitar player who doesn't scrape the strings,"The cd is as beautiful as all the other Sade recordings. It could be improved, however, if the guitar player didn't scrape the strings so much. It's the same effect as nails across the chalkboard. It diverts one's attention from the smoothness of her voice."
4,Welcome back Sade!,"This album is a fantastic album from someone who never should have stopped making albums. It is wonderful to hear her voice again. This album is beautiful and sad at the same time. ""By your side"" is the best song on the album by far, however ""King of Sorrow"" may bring tears to your eyes."
3,Sade plays it safe?,"Like one of many I am a HUGE fan of Sade but I must say I have mixed feelings about this long awaited album. I'm a bit disappointed. It took her 5+ years to come up with this? Don't get me wrong I would pay to hear Sade gargle but each track sounds a bit like the last - or is it just me? Sade's lyrics never disappoint and each track is good but I must say I am a bit disappointed with their unoriginality. No track stands out but the overall groove and sound is unmistakably Sade and succeeds in putting you in a mellow mood. Buy this CD if you are a Sade fan and, like me, would buy any thing she puts out but if you have never heard Sade and want to check her out, I would recommend starting with her one of her past recordings."
4,Loved It!,"I loved this cd.It's really good.When I listen to it,it reminds me of some of her other songs on ""The Best of Sade"",that I had.""Somebody Already Broke my Heart"",""King of Sorrow"" and ""Lover's Rock"" are my favorites.Sade has a smooth,soothing,relaxing,somewhat peaceful voice and sound to her.She's very talented.And I like the fact that she keeps herself out of the media.She keeps herself very secluded,which is a good thing.But this album is good,and it shows her maturity too."
5,a lady of the popular music,"Sade's music is amazing (and specially lovers rock) because everybody could like these songs. Teenagers in love, old men or women, playful gays... I don't know everybody fall in love with these tender songs. My favorite songs are ""By your side"", ""King of sorrow"", ""Every word"" and ""Lovers rock"".Everybody who like pop music should have this cd."
2,I was disappointed,I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed when I listened to this CD. I'm happy to say that I borrowed it and didn't actually buy it. There is one good song that I really enjoyed so I gave it 2 stars for that but it is not really up to Sade's normally high standards.
3,sade Lovers Rock,"The title alone of the new Sade release gives a clue as to what is in store.""Lovers Rock"" was a style not unlike ""Quiet Storm"" popular in the 70's with Reggae artists like Freddie Mc Gregor, Gregory Isaacs and the brilliant ""Heptones"".Unfortunately Sade manages to smooth out any of the grit that made these extaordinary vocalists sooo incredible.Her last effort was as good as anything that was released at the time,this is not .On first listen I thought ""Wow"" sounds interesting .Subsequent plays have had me reaching for old Smokey Robinson and Gladys Knight releases and wondering when the new Maxwell album is coming.Get Love Deluxe or the new Rachelle Ferrelle release instead ."
3,Not her best work,"I got Sade new cd Lover's Rock 3days b4 it came out. I have a friend who owns a record store. Anyway, I was hoping that this new cd would compare to her other ones, I was a little disappointed. There are only a few songs on here I like. Somebody already broke my heart is my fave, but for the most part there's nothing to brag about. I'm a big Sade fan, so I was really looking 4ward to hearing her again after all the time she's been away. Maybe all the time away took away some of her soul, but I thought it could have been a better mix of music."
4,ITS SADE,"Not much to say. Its Sade... its what you expect from her, its nothing different. The great thing is she was always great, and it wasnt broke, so she didnt fix it. You feel her pain. She touches your heart. Soul exposed. Brilliance.Only negative thing is that after all this time away, she graces us with only 44 minutes of music. Of course quality is better than quantity always, but, she could have gave us a little more to hold us over to the next decade. But what she gave us works."
5,I couldn't have waited any longer,"In my opinion, there are very few artists out there who, when they don't release a new album in 8 years, leave their many fans starving for more. Sade Adu is one of those artists. What's more, no one else out there has created and owned his/her own sound and style more distinctly than Sade. Ironically, there is such a hidden and private quality about her that makes her music that much more meaningful. Her new LOVERS ROCK album is, in one word, a dream. There is nothing worse than an album that only has two or three good songs. With LOVERS ROCK, just pop it in and relax."
3,"Not her best, but still good","I expected a lot more from Sade after an 8-year hiatus. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that this is a bad CD at all, but it just doesn't quite live up to ""Love Deluxe"" or ""Stronger Than Pride"" for that matter. Usually with one of Sade's releases I can just listen straight through without skipping, but that is not the case here. ""King of Sorrow"" ""Somebody Already Broke My Heart"" and ""By Your Side"" are the strongest tracks on this album. The rest are forgettable and lacking in variety. Where are the uptempo tracks? After a while, it just kind of became background music -- kind of nice -- but bland. Perhaps they just needed to work out some kinks. (...)Anyhoo, this was an okay effort, and I hope we don't have to wait another 8 years for the follow-up."
3,Lovers Rock,"I've always loved Sade and have all of her albumns. On this release she is exactly where she left off eight years ago, wonderful. My disdain for this albumn is with the recording engineer. Didn't he/she listen to the songs? Eggad, have you heard of nylon strings? The guitar screehes were shrill and although not on every song, they definitely destroyed the romantic mood one would expect from a Sade albumn. I know the majority of reviewers are pleased with this albumn, but I really disliked everything except her singing. I also fault the recording engineer for not dubbing down the back ground noise of the drum machine(?)and again guitar as mentioned above. She's great, the albumn is not. Old fans and new alike may be in awe of this albumn, but it is not my favorite Sade through no fault of her own."
2,Sade lovers only,"To really enjoy these 11 tracks you have to be a Sade lover in extemis. There is hardly any variation in the style, rhythm or sound and after eleven tracks of the same I was tearing my hair out. Sade sounds as if she has just got out of bed and is still bemused by the world around her. This will not encourage me to buy her next one, despite having a collection of three of her previous CDs.Harry"
2,It could have been a Classic!,"Like most Sade fans I could not wait to get my copy of Lovers Rock. Unfortunately, after spending a week trying to get into the new CD its not done it for me. There isn't enough strong songs on this set to really grab your attention. I even played Diamond Life and Love Deluxe again, and they are far superior albums, and still sound fresh and up-lifting even now. I look forward to hearing the next classic Sade album, whenever that may be."
2,lovers rock/sade,"glad i had chance to hear two/threetracks before buying, saved some money. can never compare to her great albums."
3,Still Waiting,"OK let's get one thing straight,I am glad Sade is back. However,as I checked out each track,I kept waiting for something more than I was getting to happen; it never did. The songs,for the most part,are well conceived;the production is above par and the arrangements tend to be bland overall. The redemption here is the voice of Sade.Lovers Rock did not deliver variety in instrumention and the fingers of the bassist sliding over his strings was distrubingly noticeable.Sade has more to give, I'm waiting."
4,Lovers Rock,""" By Your Side"": The most basic back to the roots of "" Sade "". Great combination of "" Latin American, Folk, and contemp. Jazz ""."
5,SADE'S SULTRY,"As usual, I'm enjoying Sade's new release, Lover's Rock. True to form, Sade integrates her sultry voice with meaningful lyrics and soothing music to make a great album. I advise all Sade fans to listen to this release while sitting in front of a fireplace with incense burning, book in hand and relax."
5,A smooth and passionate CD,"After a long way away from music, Sade shows that her music can stand the test of time. Her music may not reach the Top 40 today(which I say is clogged with too much boy bands, J-LO, and Brittney Spears), but it is still a CD that makes for great listening. Many of the songs just come out in a smooth tone. there is passion in everything Sade sings. She now sings for her fans, rather than for mainstream approval. That is what music is all about. It's not about royalties and profits. Sade respects the music. This CD is just a good example. It's great for rainy nights or helping us deal with the sadness of love. Welcome back, Sade. :-)"
5,LOVE ROCK,Sade is amazing. She is the best in my book. Even after an 8-year absence she comes back strong and powerful. She's a true legend. There will never be another Sade.
3,"Half great, half so-so.","As another reviewer put it this is not her best, but its still better than most of the other junk out there. For those looking for a triumphantly powerful follow-up to her amazing 1992 LOVE DELUXE, you may be *slightly* disappointed. Some of the tunes here (specifically #'s 5, 6, 10 and 11) are dull. I usually skip them. On the positive side, the first four tracks sound great. I like how ""Somebody Already Broke My Heart"" incorporates that slight wavering keyboard that I somehow can't stand when I hear it in the ubiquitous rap song, and makes it work. Somehow it doesn't sound 'played' here. ""Flow"" harkens back to her previous release with its MASSIVE bass. A great song. Also of note, ""Every Word"" is very catchy as is ""King of Sorrow"". These songs make the album worth checking out. As usual, the production on this album is immaculate-the mix is awesome."
2,Lover's Rock Does NOT Rock...,"This is the first Sade album I ever bought. I enjoyed all of the 20-something songs that were and still are being played on jazz stations today, but this album has no radio hits. ""Lover's Rock"" is a lack-luster, tedious album to listen to straight through. Although Sade is one of the pioneers of ""quiet storm"", this album is no where near that category. It has no real beats, no catchy melodies, and no Stuart Matthewman guitar/sax solos. That doesn't mean that the whole album is a flop though. There are some songs that I found noteworthy- ""King Of Sorrow"", ""Immigrant"", and ""Every Word"", but the other ones had no spark, especially ""The Sweetest Thing"" and ""It's Only Love That Gets You Through"". Talk about a ""snore-iffic"". If you're expecting to hear another ""Maureen"" or ""I Couldn't Love You More""... don't buy this."
2,Musical evolution becomes musical devolution,"In a word, yuck. With the exception of ""Flow,"" there is no Sade of yesteryear present on this CD. It's all an exploration of a new musical style, with that trademark yearning voice the only clue that you are listening to Sade. ""By Your Side"" stunned me into open-mouthed silence with its country twang; for this to be the first release is nothing short of a travesty. Next time when the group is shopping for a new sound, they would be well advised to remember that there was nothing wrong with the old one."
3,It's all right but her previous CDs are better.,"My sister bought it and played it on the CD player. Her songs are okay. Not much to groove about. It's easy listening. Sade, however, can still sing and she is a great artist."
1,lover's rock,Am i the only one that is disturbed by the annoying guitar fret changing noise??>?I can't seem to hear anything else.Pass on this one. Sade should be embarrassed at the poor recording quality!!
1,A long wait for a major disappointment,"The jazzy, mesmerizing quality of Sade's voice that made her a major force in the music world was sorely missing on her latest offering. Each new song sounded pretty much the same as one previous to it. Her back up band, Sweetback lacked its usual drive and the tunes were recorded with annoying scratchy sounds of fingers sliding over guitar strings. After having waited eagerly for years for some new material, I hope she goes back to the drawing board to recapture what made her so terrific."
1,Not worth the wait,For some one who had this much time to put out a quality CD she realy missed the boat. Each song sounds like the last. If you have a drum machine and can sing you can make this Cd at home. She should have quit after her last Cd. Trust me I own all her other CDs . waht ever happened to melody?
1,Disappointing,"I know I'm the odd one out but I'm comparing this to 'Diamond Life' which if you don't know Sade, you should buy first. She'll never do better than those wonderful songs from our youth but then again, how could she. She's grown old too..."
1,Lovers Schlock,"Nothing is more brain atrophying than being conned by someone you initially had such hopes for. For 15 years before the release of 'Lovers Rock' in 2001, I've grasped onto an iota of desperation that she will at the very least equal her enjoyable-cum-guilty pleasure debut in 1985. But all that's manifested every few years - as well as on 'Lovers Rock' - is a DOA compendium of lethargic tunes whispered in a voice so consistent in its tone-deaf monotony it's actually soporific. As usual, the band's competence is in tact, grooving along to its fullest groove, brought way down by Ms. Adu's emotionless non-voice. You wake up from slumber unperturbed; you stretch your arms in new relaxation...only to feel conned all over again. My grade: C+"
2,I'm Going to Keep it Really Real Here,"I'll never forget the day that ""Lovers Rock"" came out. I had finished all of my finals and it was time to sit back and chill. So I go to the CD store to get ""Lovers Rock"" and then I went to Subway to get a meatball sub. So I go back home, put the CD in the stereo, and, let me tell you, I lost my appetite. I love all of Sade's music, but ""Lovers Rock"" is her most awful work ever and wasn't worth the wait. Out of the 11 songs on the CD, I only like 2: ""All About Our Love"" and ""Lovers Rock."" Everything else is slow, dull, and pretty much sucks. I mean, you can't even jam or get into a groovy mood. It's pretty much something the Geezer Boomers would listen to. Anyway, I sold ""Lovers Rock"" and I don't miss it one bit. To all of you Sade fanatics, ""Lovers Rock"" is one CD that you wouldn't even want to add to the collection. TRUST ME."
4,"As it has been said, glad she's back!","I deejay on one of the local radio stations has been talking about this long awaited album, it seems for ages. First it was spring of '99 and then fall '99, winter, etc. Well, it has finally arrived and as a Sade fan, I am delighted. I have worn out her greatest hits CD which still gets played on a regular basis. The new album portrays a softer, mellow, matured flavor that satisfies the soul. I immediately fell in love with the first track and current release, ""By Your Side"", reminding me of a mellow country reggae tune reminscent of Bob Marley. ""King of Sorrow"" reminded me of old Sade tunes. ""The Sweetest Gift"" was smooth and ""Slave Song"" shows her ongoing consciousness. Those Sade fans expecting the upbeat tempo of older tunes such as ""Smooth Operator"" and ""Hang Onto Your Love"" will be disappointed but rest assured Sade still has the capacity to stir those loving feelings on a cold night."
4,Sade,This cd is great to sit and relax and maybe do some light reading. It also sets the mood when you and your significant other want to heat things up! Very Enjoyable!
4,The Queen of Cool,"Sade is back! We've missed her and her blend of exotic rhythem and sultry smooth vocals. She is the Goddess of Love, the Queen of Cool, and the Diva of Romance. Her voice is so compellingly smooth and sexy that we are nearly driven mad and must plug up our ears like the brave Ulysees least we dash ourselves into the rocks. Sade is back! Long live Sade."
4,"Very Good, Lovely Album But She's The Same","This sameness is going to be a plus to some people and a minus to others. Sade has a lovely voice and sings lovely songs. She always has. She's been away for eight years and she has come back sounding exactly the same. You would think that this album came out six months after her last one, not eight years. She's not better; she's not worse. She is exactly the same. It is unusual to find an artist who hasn't experienced some transforming experience which affects her art in that length of time but Sade is one of them. I guess I can't give her five stars because I expected to see either transformation or growth or some change that took place within her as an artist. There is none of those. However, she has not gone downhill in any respect which means she is still very good. If you like your other Sade albums and wanted some new songs that picked up where those left off, this is the album for you."
3,Sade's Mediocrity,"""Lover's Rock"" by Sade is not a bad album. The lyrics are good, Sade's voice has not changed at all, and the production is alright at best. The album as a whole is good. It's on the mediocre side, but it is enjoyable. ""By Your Side"" is this album's only release, and it is a nice song. ""Flow"" is another highlight. The lyrics on this song are very memorable. The album's title track is nice as well. My beef with this album is that this group made no attempt to switch things up. The sound is the same throughout then entire album. When I listen to an album, I like to experience different feelings, different moods. Thus album's lyrics have variant subjects, which I appreciate, but the tempos of the songs were basically the same, and that made this album slightly difficult to listen to.I would'nt necessarily recommend this album to people. I'd recommend it to Sade lovers, or big neo-soul fans. 3 Stars1. By Your Side2. Flow3. Somebody Already Broke My Heart4. King of Sorrow5. Immigrant"
2,Where Is The Band ?,"I've always been a huge Sade fan. Her incredibly smooth voice was always perfectly complimented by musicians who played their instruments just as smooth. This Album contains mediocre guitar playing along with popular electronic sound effects that lack emotion. Plus, her voice is over dubbed way to often. Her voice doesn't need enhancement. Bring back the band."
3,Sade's Cooled Passion,"I have been a big Sade fan for several years now and consider her to be one of my all-time favorite artists in this type of music. There is nothing on this album that is even close to her past classics. The melodies are light and undeveloped, and not uplifting. This album just never picks me up in the way her old stuff does -- even after repeated listens."
4,Sade-Acoustic,"It was a great surprise to see this comeback, I always had a soft spot in my heart for Sade, so my opinion is definitely biased.This is a completely new sound of Sade. To many it may sound as if this album is more R&B, more ""hip-hopy"" than any other. Definitely this is a more moody album, more personal and much, much more ""acoustic"" than anything Sade has come up with before. New, fresh different sound with a touch of melancholy, and always the great voice to go along with. A lot of tracks have the acoustic guitar as the main sound followed by a lazy drum rhythm. they wont make you stand up and dance like ""Paradise"" but, I think Sade fans will welcome this change with surprise. Great work."
3,Classic,I bought this CD to complete a collection. I bought this CD to complete a collection. I bought this CD to complete a collection.
4,Great Mellow CD,"This is a wonderful and mellow CD - very easy to listen to. All of the songs are very soulful. If you like Sade, this CD does not disappoint."
2,big disappointment,"i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it."
1,she has lost it....boo,"Anyone who has heard any of Sade's previous albums has to see that she has simply lost it. The magic is gone and replication is not working. Evolution of sound here has turned sour, and it may have had an effect on her as well. I would say that she should leave hip/trip-hop beats alone, or hire some professionals to create them. Further, the ""dub"" like influences here are even worse. If this were Sade's first album, I would say that she has a Promising career ahead, but we all know that this is not the case.The engineer here has no business to be in the studio and should be fired. The CD is lacking in depth and soundstage, all to all, her previous discs are sonically much more pleasant.This just seems like some forced production, either to fulfill an obligation to the record label, or just to score some cash. I would give it zero stars if I could."
1,Like Listening to Paint Dry,"What a bummer. Long after the subtle, brilliant ""Love Deluxe,"" Sade returns with this lukewarm snore-fest. The percussion is barely there, and the rhythm section seems fast asleep. Two, maybe three songs have a discernable pulse, but the overall album is drowsy and mediocre. She's capable of so much more."
3,Her worst album to date.,I love Sade but this time she just did'nt make a good effort. Mostly boring ballads. No peppy smooth jazz beats like on previous albums. I'd say it's average at best. Something to fall asleep to.
2,Very Uninspired Music,"After being away from the music scene for eight years I quess I expected the group to return in their big, but subtle way. This CD is by far the worst Sade music I have ever heard. I do not understand the rave reviews. I am a huge Sade fan and I was very disappointed by this release. It is very stale music. As one review said ""time stands still"". It does, but it appears to have passed Sade by. Do not by this CD!"
3,Sade Lovers Rock,The main reason I bought this album was because of the veryfirst track (by your side).I didn't really like the other songs onthe album. but i would say the album is worth buying(because the first song is really cool)!
2,"Long Wait, No Reward","Wow, it has been forever since we have had new work by Sade. Unfortunately, this CD disappoints severly. From any other artist this work might be worth a listen as a promise of future potential, but from Sade, it is not up to speed. The material is unbelievably poor. The selections remind one of a B side, never meant for prime time. I have played it over and over hoping for a better impression. All in all a very disappointing effort by one of the best. If you are not familiar with her work, buy Diamond Life, if you are, perhaps a better effort waits further out on the horizon."
4,The Lady is very smooth,Sade's newest CD will not let you down. It's well balanced and provides relaxing enjoyment that is very characteristic of all her tunes. Preview it relax and let the music flow.
2,Her heart is not in this,"As much as I love Sade and her elusive, seductive sound, her latest CD struck me as having delivered a CD for all reasons save the one that counts most-her heart an soul was in it. She obvioulsy waited 8 years to launch her latest-perhaps she should have waited several more years until she was really committed to delighting her fans. Unfortunately, this does not measure up."
1,Lovers Rock Doesn't,"Talk about feeling disappointed! I listened to this album 5 times,and still ended up giving it away. I anticipated feeling mesmerized by this album as I have with Sade's previous works, but instead I felt depressed after listening to this monotonous and vacant droning! The groove is gone! Sade, what's happened to you?!"
1,Artificial beats weigh Sade down,"I just couldn't get into this album at all. Sade tends to cover the same ground over & over again, but this time it is hampered by tinny, artificial beats. Drum programming was expected in the 80s, but Sade bucked the trend at that time & in doing so was a breath of fresh air. Now it seems like she's giving in to it, 15 years later. Who knows why. It sounds both dated & trendy at once. If you want to hear Sade at her best, pick up ""Diamond Life"" or ""Promise"". This one rings false."
4,"Great voice, but not so good songs","I think she has a great voice. But I think she have a very monotonous CD. The songs are regular, not the singer."
2,Depressing,"I really didn't find one song that jumped out as a great song. Although her talent is obvious, none of the songs we upbeat and catchy. I'm sorry but in my opinion you have to be a REAL HARDCORE Sade fan to appreciate this CD."
1,Hollow effort,"I bought this CD after two people recommended it. I was very dissapointed. I own most of Sade's early works and really enjoy them. This CD is very down beat and not up to the usual high standards of Sade's other albums. This one lacks the soulful upbeat nature of previous work. While I feel her pain, it doesn't sound like her heart was really into this project. I listened to this CD start to finish twice, and honestly don't feel the need to listen to it again. This album is vague and unremarkable, which is too bad because Sade is a great artist. I can't recommend this album, I hope her next effort is better."
1,Choppy & uneven sound - not even close to her other work,"I actually had to recheck my cd to make sure I had the same one as eveyone reviewed here - personally, I thought this was awful -the other reviewers have a right to their opinion & I'm glad they enjoyed this cd, but i have a right to mine & I found the music here to be choppy, uneven & extremely slow moving - I've been a fan of Sade for years & have all her other albums & enjoy her work very much, but this sounded as if she was just dragging along - my husband, sister & 2 friends who are all fans agreed that this was not her best work - very disappointing."
3,Not the Sade we know.,"I have collected every one of Sade's previous CDs. I love her style and vocal grace. Her alto has depth and passion and I was hoping for something similar to previous releases with depth and insight and pure imagination. This CD seems like it was put together with the same ""sound"" over and over again on each track. I was truly disappointed after waiting for so long. This is not worth buying."
2,This is a STINKER!,"Sorry, folks but this one is terrible. I am a big Sade fan buying her albums from day one and really loving them. I also love the fact that they kept getting better and better - up until this one unfortunately. When I first heard the single on the radio I thought it was ok but couldn't understand that horrible guitar squeek. Much to my amazement, the whole album has that annoying sound throughout. I could get used to that (unprofessional as it is) but the whole album (a mere 45 minutes) sounds like a practice session of all the songs that got rejected from the real album. It is annoying, repetitive, and not SADE at all. It sounds more like a contractual obligation album. This one is a stinker! If you want the real thing, start with LOVE DELUXE and work your way backwards. Try again SADE!!"
2,Disappointed,"I have been a Sade fan since her first album, Diamond Life, and what I have always loved is her sultry, international sound and soul filled rhythms. But Lover's Rock is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I like only two songs, It's All About Our Love and By Your Side. The rest are dispensible. This album feels rushed. Like the band didn't have enough time to finish the songs. There are no layers of rhythms or beats that we have come to expect from Sade. The lyrics just don't resonate with me and that is something I thought I would never say about a Sade album. It all feels like a first effort. Something thrown together to meet a deadline. With a dud like this, I seriously hope it's not another 8 years before they come out with another album. They need to redeem themselves quickly."
5,Another Great Album by the Lady of Elegance and Grace...,"Lovers Rock is one of the most greatest albums you'll ever come across. It hits a spot in your soul, and you can't help but feel the words, rhythm, and the beat. Sade is just that good. Whenever I listen to this album, it's always on repeat. I wish that she would bless us with another great CD because I've been hungry for more for quite some time now."
4,SADE MAKES HER TRIUMPHANT RETURN!,"R&B is a hot commodity in the 21st century. Such hot soul acts like D'Angelo and Destiny's Child have brought more attention to R&B in the past year more than any other artists. Yet it seem ironic that the woman who took over the realm of R&B in the 80's should decide to make her return while the coals are already nice and hot for herself. Sade once again puts together a package of songs pulled along by her smooth-as-silk vocals and dance beats. These two elements permiate to make one of the best albums released in 2000. With any luck, Sade is back...and here to stay."
5,Long awaited - but worth the wait,I love every song on this CD. Sensual and thoughtprovoking like her her previous work.
5,"What a classic, classy, soulful woman.","Just heard the new Sade ""Lover's Rock"" CD.Three words: Time Stands Still.Nothing more to be said, except ""buy it""."
3,A welcome return ...,"No one has more mystique and signature style than Sade, and this album is no exception. The first half of the album stands stronger than the latter half. ""By Your Side"" opens up with signature Sade, slow trip hop beats, with her trademark voice gasping on the brink of being intensely in love and intensely sad. ""King of Sorrow"" and ""Somebody Already Broke My Heart"" are the two other standouts. On the former tune, Sade belts out the first note, as though in a cry of grief. Though the album plays well in the background alongside conversations, car rides and dinner parties, it seems to lack the punch to springboard it into the annals of Sade classics."
4,Slowburner of great soul release,"Well 8 years of absence wasnt so bad after all...as Sade has remerged with their brand new album Lovers Rock. The album never gets beyond mid-tempo, there's no sing-along chorus and the mood is mostly sombre. what makes the CD special is ultimately the alluring and soulful voice of Sade Adu which strings the songs together in perfection. Sade sings of love lost and love found in that perfect blend of pop/R&B-soulfulness... By Your Side, Immigrant, Every Word & Lovers Rock are some of the wonderful tracks from the Sade. Don't expect anything OTT or hip-hop, this is soul without the frills...even the entire CD packaging looks like an over-simplified accompliment. Lyrics and few pics adorn the sleeve. A proof that great music needs litle hype."
2,slightly frozen comeback of Sade,After listening this album I am a bit disappointed by the come-back of Sade. Especially the music doesn't approach the intimite atmosphere and smoothness from earlier albums from both Sade and Sweetback. This album comes to me like a pretty cold winter...
2,"a review of this CD, not Sade","Take a look at all the 4 and 5 star reviews... nearly every one praises Sade the artist, her voice, how we fell in love with her first album, etc. I'm sorry, I love most of Sade's work, but I don't rate a CD 4 or 5 stars simply because I like the artist as a whole. If you look for honest reviews of this CD, I agree with them- this is easily her weakest work. It's simply boring. And where's her band? I don't believe they're on here- and they're sorely missed- there's no sax, and the drum machine is VERY annoying. Anyway, I had to add this to balance all the 4 and 5 star reviews. Her other albums are 4 and 5 star, not this one."
3,Good...but disappointing,"I've been a Sade fan ever since the album Stronger Than Pride. So you can only imagine my happiness when I heard she was coming out with Lovers Rock, but I'm sorry to say this album is disappointing. It's refreshing to have Sade back, in a year of talentless entertainers and singers, but in Sade standards, this album isn't the best. It can't hold a candle to Love Deluxe, which in my opinion was the best R&b and jazz album of the 90's. There are some great albums on the song though, such as ""King Of Sorrow"" and ""All about Our Love"" and ""Sweetest Gift"", but it can be better. I never imagined skipping tracks on a Sade cd, but with cd, I have to. If your person who wants to listen to something other than the crap we have been hearing on the radio this year, your appreciate the touching lyrics, and Sade's soothing voice. But if your die-hard Sade fan, let me just say it is worth the $15, but Sade has better"
5,a music lover,"This CD is a must for any Sade fan. It seems like she hasn't missed a beat even though it's been years since she last recorded. I liked every song. Also, the CD came with a bonus CD. What more can you ask for."
5,A Good Forgiveness Gift :),"I borrowed 'Lover Rock' from my father years ago and played it over and over again till it got scratched up! He would always ask for me to return it and I always promised I would. Then last Christmas Eve of 2006, after buying toys for my niece's kids I decided as I walked into 'Virgin Records' to buy 'Lovers Rock' & 'Love Deluxe' as a gift to both my parents as a way to say I'm sorry and I love you. . .unfortunately my Dad was in Florida on Christmas Day (a Monday) but when he returned that weekend I made him open the gift over the phone - he was so surprise!!! Everytime I see ""By Your Side"" the music video and catch the part of elderly couple dancing togerther with Sade in the snow - I think of my parents:)"
3,Smooth & mellow,"She's back! To my surprise Sade kept her style. To me it sounds like a continuation from her 80ies albums. I still like those albums better though. Nevertheless, buying this cd is definitely not a loss or hardly as dispappointing as Toni Braxton's new cd."
3,Not as good as author's other mysteries,"Somehow this was just not up to the plot and flavor of the writer's other mysteries. Perhaps it was a result of mixing silent movie making and baseball. I wanted more Ebbetts Field, Casey Stengel, etc. I watched many Dodger games in that old park, and I wanted to relive the feeling. Soos accomplished that in his mysteries about the Reds and the Red Sox, but I felt a little let down this time around."
4,the unreal ghost busters are on the job,"Most people probably have no recollection of this Filmation project from nine years before the Ghostbusters movie. The original ""unreal"" Ghost Busters are Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch from F Troop reunited with a gorilla named Tracy. Ultra-cheap Saturday morning fare, and in each episode a different ghost takes up residence in the same haunted house. Every week Spensser (Storch) can't get the filing cabinet to open. In every episode Kong (Tucker) sends Spensser and Tracy (what, no Hepburn?) to pick up the next ghost busting assignment, and it blows up in Tracy's hands. Extremely repetitive, but the fun part is seeing who the ghost is. Lots of celebrity guests like Jim Backus, Carl Ballantine, Severn Darden, and Huntz Hall. The theme song is great, with lines like ""your skin has the creepies."""
4,Ghost Buster - The Complete Series,It is great to have the videos to give to our grown sons. We watched these with them when they were small boys. Although not as funny as we remember them (this is probably due to the years of embellishment in our memories.)
4,grip on tools,Haven't used them yet but they look to be what I was expecting.The box was broken when I received them but that isn't a problem
1,Good concept but badly executed,"I've been using the Jumpstart games for my kids since they were in Pre-K and they love playing with them. I bought the Languages set for my 5 yr old thinking it would be a great intro to foreign languages. She enjoyed the games at first, but quickly grew bored. There are fewer games than in the other Jumpstart sets and they're not as challenging. My biggest complaint is that the sound quality and pronounciation for the foreign words are so hard to decipher I doubt my kids will be able to figure them out. I would suggest giving this set a miss."
3,Not as I thought!,"I guess because there are 4 languages it doesn't give you the much variety to interact as the ""Spanish Language"" that will take to the cloth, colors, and find them, etc.I guess you will be OK if you buy one language as supposed to the 4 in Once CD."
5,Great computer learning game,"I was a little skeptical at first, but after seeing my 4 yr old play I knew it was a good buy. He's 7 now and still plays."
4,good solid b-western,"i remember this movie from when i was little and the 3:00 o'clock movie would come on, and i still find that i like it! a group of soldiers must keep the title gun away from indians as they protect a familt and try to get the gun to work. noyhing great here but a good solid b-western from the last days of the big screen western!"
3,Saw it as a kid.,"I saw this flick a couple of times growing up. It's nothing much to brag about, but it's a passable western. My real review regards Amazon's streaming; it looks pretty bad. The colors are there, but the image and overall transfer are of a low grade. The movie isn't that sterling to begin with, but it's solid western fare.The shots are amateurish, the directing is b-grade, but the script is decent enough. Too bad the image is slightly washed and pixilated.If you subscribed to Amazon Prime, you might want to view it for an evening, but otherwise don't spend the money to rent it."
2,KING GUN,"The Gatling Gun is one of my favorte western videos. It has good action and adventure. The weapon,The Gatling Gun is my favorte weapon but when I found out there was a movie called The Gatling Gun my Dad bought the movie for me. It's a good movie but not a great movie."
1,not happy,"After very carefully making the basic recipe and trying repeatedly, we are convinced this machine makes pizzelles too thin for.....anything. They can't hardly be removed from the press. The lack of a cooking surface border for squeezed-out batter also makes this a very messy machine."
2,CucinaPro Nonstick Pizzelle,I was very disappointed with they way this iron worked. I had an old pizzelle iron which was cast iron and did a beautiful job. Now all I can find is the nonstick ones. The temperature is very uneven and the cookies are not as uniform or as pretty as the ones I used to make. It was not worth the money. I'm going to look at flea markets in hopes of finding an old cast iron one.
4,Works well.,"first time making pizzelles . Iron worked well, but only makes two at a time, so it takes a while to get though the recipe .no complaints. Worth the $$."
4,Nice Pizzelle maker,I bought this as a birthday present for my mother who used it to make her Christmas Pizzelles this year. She said it worked just fine and was satisfied with it.
5,Very nice,"Although I just got this and have only made one batch, I thought this made perfect pizzelles. My last pizzelle maker was impossible to clean- batter got into crevices and made a real mess. Not this one, clean up was easy. Once you get the timing down to the done ness you like, just put a stopwatch down and time them. Mine were perfect in 1:50. Uniform cooking and really did not even need a brush of oil to make them non stick. After looking for a replacement pizzelle maker for awhile, I would not hesitate to recommend this one. The only thing I worry about is the latch. It seems to be just a cheap wire that could easily wear out as I like to latch it to make the pizzelles the same thickness. I'll just have to be careful."
2,"The first book was a charm, but this was a letdown","I was really looking forward to this book because I loved her first one about Sinclair and Jo Quincy. I was disappointed in this book, though and here's a list of reasons why: (1) Neither of the main characters had the same kind of spark as the ones in her first book; (2) even the cat in this one (Macbeth) lacked the pizzazz of Sir Ambrose; (3) too many characters! I needed a score card to track the plot; (4) I thought the plot was less intersting (smugglers?), and (5)I just didn't find Tony or Sylvia very appealing people. At least with Jo and Sinclair, there was wit and humor. With these two, he seemed directionless until he stumbles upon this village (not exciting to me) and she seemed just like any other female victim of the era--impoverished lady trying to solve her problems in a man's world."
3,Don't Buy Just Yet,"This album boasts an interesting concept, and serves as a great background cd if you have a lot of crap to do and you want to keep your energy flowing. But it can't compare to ""Bow Down to the Exit Sign"", an absolutely brilliant and completely visceral listening experience. Might I suggest buying the ""Don't Die Just Yet"" single featuring remixes by Arab Strap and Delakota that are better than anything you'll find on this LP. Having said that, I can't wait to hear what Holmes puts out next. It's nice to hear a DJ who really pushes himself into unknown territory."
5,"Take a trip into the thick, pulp, shimmering muse--ic","This CD (which i got used for $7.99) had to be the greatest deal ever. The environments that each song creates are so visual and relaxing that you feel as though you are in some cinematic scene blending in. Rodney Yates is a mellow, jazzy song that makes me want to get up and join Uma on the dance floor. While Slasher's Revenge sounds like a John Carpenter themed horror film at the beginning and then mutates into a shimmering piece of electronica. Freaknik blows up just like its title explains and flows in a seismic fashion throughout. Why anyone would sell this CD back is a complete mystery to me. Please don't die just yet Holmes."
4,Great tough music that's like the real world,"It makes you feel like you're walking through a subway station in New York. This CD is one of the best of my collection because of its coldness. This music should be used in a Tarantino-type film. lets get killed has a smooth original bassline that sounds like someone is about to get killed. Along with that, Rodney Yates and don't die just yet are the best tracks. When ever I go to the city(San Francisco) and walk down the busy streets, I have these songs playing in my head. David Holmes, along with Dorfmeister have the best sounds out of any Drum-Bass DJ's I've heard. If you buy this one, also buy the soundtrack to ""Out of Site"". He makes some really cool songs on that album as well."
3,Holmes debut falls short.,"I am a fan of electronic music, especially funky beats. That is what I was expecting after reading the Spin magazine review I bought the CD. It was a disappointment because it has very little original material. It feels like I have heard it all before. If you want a good beat CD check out DAFT PUNK. This will do if you are desperate for funk."
5,The Soundtrack to the Underbelly of New York,"Sampling snippets from monologues from NYC's left-of-center and sometimes unsavory characters as lead-ins to smooth and slinky beats, David Holmes has created album that listens like a movie. Listening any track, you can feel yourself pounding the pavement of Manhattan late at night. Most tracks are downtempo dub but still possess a pervasive menace throughtout."
3,Judith Petres Balogh,"The book was not quite what I expected. It did not add much to my store of knowledge, and did not sharpen my perceptions. It is one of those ""must"" books, which is generally thought to be of importance, and nobody dares argue with the decree. I did not mind reading it, but I lacked the necessary enthusiasm for it."
2,Poorly Conceived Blu Ray Audio package,Poorly conceived Blu Ray Audio package. Audio quality is also not as good as a typical DVD Audio CD or SACD.Load time slow. Need Video screen to play the audio. Should be similar in concept to an SACD methodology.
5,Petty's breakthrough album,"Damn the Torpedoes (1979) was Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers third album, and it just so happened to be their breakthrough. While both 1976's Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and 1978's You're Gonna Get It did respectively, Petty and the Heartbreakers hadn't had a major hit until Refugee from Damn the Torpedoes hit the airwaves back in 79. Once Refugee hit the radio and became a hit, the album became a hit as well. With such classics as Refugee, Even the Losers, Here Comes My Girl, Don't Do Me Like That, Lousiana Rain, and What are You doin in My Life, Damn the Torpedoes remains one of classic rocks finest albums, and Petty's best early album."
4,Damn It's Good,"Well, being a collector this is a nice package, for the regular fan, it gives some more depth in the album it's self. I personally think the second CD should have been a lot longer thus my 4 start rating. It was a breakthrough album in many rights due to getting the album out to the public. also some fans thought this was Petty's start to going totally commercial. Anyway, this one is worth getting if you don't have the original album. Check out my site sometime at ""Judemac Forever"""
3,Century City Skip,"The sound is awesome. For some reason the first record I purchased(not from amazon) had a ""Century City"" skip. The replacement also skips on ""Century City"". I tried Grateful Dead's Europe '72 and no skipping. I also tried the new Rolling Stones, ""Exile On Main Street""(Reissue) and that did not skip. I'm pretty sure it's not my setup. Is there a production issue with this release??"
4,&#65533;and full speed ahead.,"Petty wastes no time getting started on this one. Each song moves along with powerful vocals and a driving rhythm section; tales of love and loss are put forth with Petty's rock and roll sensibility with able assistance from the Heartbreakers. Plenty of well-known songs on this one (""Refugee,"" Don't Do Me Like That""), but the whole CD holds up. One of Petty's earlier works and it has all the enthusiasm of youth. A very solid CD."
4,Audio quality,"This one turns out to be in dvd format DTS 96/24. Still sounds good. But, repackaging old material into bluray should at least have a fresh mix of the sound. This is not good for the future of Audio blurays like the Dvd-Audio which never really caught on except with audiophiles."
5,This book is the mother-lode on mysticism.,"For the best study of mysticsm, this is the true text book. Word of warning - I picked it up as my first book on the subject and felt I was reading a foreign language. After reading three books about individual mystics, I again picked up Mysticism and found that the book was incredible and probably the best reference book ever written, or to be written, on this topic. I am sure I will refer to it again and again for further detail on certain ways of the mystics. It is apparent that this was Ms. Underhill's mission in life - to interpret and explain mysticism for all of us."
1,Mysticism,No table of contents...no chapter headings...just 500 pages of text. It's a superb book- pick another edition.
5,More than a good book.,"I would recommend this book if you are serious about becoming a personal assistant, or wanting new ideas of skill building. It's very resourceful and a book you'd always look back to."
4,Good research for career change,"A good read for any admin., excutive assistant or super organized individual that is ready to try something else."
1,Inaccurate,"This book is mythologically inaccurate, sexist and culturally slanted. I am completing a dissertation (encompassing Medusa) in Mythological Studies. I would never allow this book in the library of my child's school. This is the only one of this series that I have read, but if they all are like this, it's time for them to go out of print"
2,Many terms unclear or missing.,"I purchased this book as a ""good to have"" as a psych undergrad student.I consistently find that the term I want to check isn't there, or the definition is so vague as to be of no use. For an example of a missing term, mindfulness, a popular psychological technique related to meditation, isn't in there, yet it has been researched for decades.It's got good stuff in it - but for me, it just never seems to have the thing I'm actually looking at it for."
5,"excellent value, far cheaper than the shops","good value, valable book to have for studying.much cheaper than buying in the shops.didnt have to pay VAT from north america!"
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing. Bland, with a bitter, burnt aftertaste. I was looking for something to replace the ridiculously-priced Maxwell House sugar-free suisse mocha international coffee but this ain't it-- too bad.Laura L, El Cerrito, CA"
2,bitter coffee,This coffee is so bitter. I have used 6 packets of sweetener and it is still bitter. It so smells good but the taste is what really counts.
1,disappointing,This product does very little to make a nice cup of coffee. It adds almost no taste. Compares poorly to similar products
1,Not Good,I purchased this product because I am diabetic and am always looking for new sugar free items to try. I just wanted to let everyone know that I do not like your product at all. I hate it that I spent that much money for something that I just had to throw in the trash. I have bought General Foods International swiss mocha and love it. Guess I'll have to go back to drinking it.
1,Just plain tastes bad,"(09/08/09) I really enjoy the regular sugar-type Caffe D'Vita, but I wanted to try the sugar-free version to reduce calories. It looks extra creamy in the cup, but my girlfriend and I were both very disappointed with the flavor. She wouldn't even finish her first cup. I got mine down, but didn't enjoy it. It just tastes bad--almost bitter. I wasted the money to buy a whole 6-pack of cans, and now I'm going to take it to work to put in the break room; maybe others will find it tolerable if it's free.(Update: 10/26/09) I did take the 5 1/2 cans to work and put them in two break rooms. There are several dozen employees using these break rooms and in about five weeks time there are still over three full cans left! It appears that many people are not interested in trying it, and if they do, they never have it again. I sympathize. I have since gone back to the regular mocha version with sugar and continue to enjoy it."
5,Caffe D'Vita Sugar Free Mocha Cappuccino,"I've been using this product for a long time. It tastes almost as good as the sugar version, and it's ideal for someone on a low carb diet."
2,No taste,"I usually drink the regular Caffe D""Vita but I am on a low carb diet with no sugar so I thought I would try the sugar free. I couldn't find it in the stores so I bought a six pack can through the internet. It has absolutly no taste. Now I am stuck with six cans of sugar free Caffe D"" Vita and don't know what to do with them. I would not buy this product again."
5,caffee divita,I love the product as usual. I will continue ordering the product. The taste is what I like. Keep on sending it.Thanks
5,Indulge without being indulgent,"I fell in love with this product when it was sold at my local COSTCO, now I can't live without it. It is a wonderful indulgence added to my coffee in the morning!"
1,30 mg Caffeine for watered down bland serving,"Very Disappointed in this.So much so, that I was inspired to write my first review.This products labeling is just wrong:1) I called the company stating any cocoa has caffeine, so it cannot be 99% caffeine free.They said it has 30 mg CAFFEINE per 2 tsp. serving which is too little for a good flavor.2) IT TAKES MORE than 2 tsp. per serving or tastes very watered down & not creamy. II required 2 TBSP for 12 oz. water3) IT WASN'T SWEET at all, just enough to cut the bitter - I assume.So I preferred adding a regular amount of Stevia for a better taste.I suggest anyone give Hills Bros Sugar free french vanilla cappuccino a try.Besides tasting great, you'll only get 30mg max. of caffeine for a satisfying 12 oz. serving.Bon Appetit"
1,Yuck!,I should have listened to the negative reviews for this product. I am diabetic and was hoping for a pleasing cappuccino for a treat. Taste is absolutely horrible. So sorry I ordered a case of this. I'll never use it.
2,Don't waste your money,"I was really disappointed with this product. Was looking for something to keep at my desk at work. It is bitter as well as lacking in flavor. I use products with artificial sweetner all the time so it is not like I'm missing the sugar. Don't know why this stuff tastes so bad. Sugar free hot cocoa tastes great so not sure what went wrong here. Anyway here is my recipe... take 1 envelope of sugar free cocoa mix (the kind with milk in the mix) and add one teaspoon of instant coffee or instant espresso and 1 packet of equal add hot water. Voila, tastes way better than this stuff."
4,A Little Iffy,"Hmm...Well. This is debatable, now isn't it? Edgy, yet addictive. Classy, yet confusing. Their are two sides to this one. Over all, I liked it."
2,You Really Could Have It So Much Better,"This album is appropriately named, because you honestly can do so much better than this album. Their prior album was very good, but with the exception of a few tracks, this one is bland. I listened to it maybe 10 times after buying it when it first came out and didn't listen to it again until today, hoping I would have a different opinion of it. But I haven't changed my mind. If you liked their first album, I would recommend the Arctic Monkeys, which is a fantastic band. Both of their albums are superior to anything Franz Ferdinand has done."
4,What's wrong with a little destruction?,"This is a strong album for various reasons. The diversity of the tracks goes far beyong their first album which I view now as a much more pop based and repetative creation. While I loved it because it set a beat to my walk and provided some classics, none of those songs have the musical depth of this cd. The guitar rifts have evolved and the songs sound much more put together. The lyrics are original-- One of the weaker tracks is the namesake of the whole album.But all in all. Good Show FF.PS. Before I read some of the reviews on Amazon I was impressed at the almost Beatle esque tracks on the cd. Such as Eleanor Put Your Boots On. Notice the name Eleanor, maybe of the Rigby fame. The piano is masterfully integrated into this one."
5,They did it so much better,"Franz are without a doubt my favorite group of my generation, and they outdid themselves with this album. 'The Fallen' is an absolute treasure lyrically, something you rarely get in pop music today. Very catchy music, thought provoking lyrics, a must have for all the anti-socials out there."
4,Do believe the hype!,"As I type these words, the song Do You Want To plays through my computer speaker, and I sit here, tapping my foot. This is also the kind of music I'd enjoy driving to. In other words, it moves me, in a real good way.Initially, I was skeptical of the hype about this band. But as I gave them a listen, I realized that I was wrong about them. In fact, they have a true knack for catchy, melodious tunes (as do a number of their Scottish predecessors, such as Jesus and Mary Chain and the Pastels) and witty, clever lyrics. And watching them on Saturday Night Live a few weeks ago, I could see that they have real stage presence. The more I hear them, the more I really like them. Only time will tell if they are one of the greats, or merely a very good band of this decade. One thing seems clear, though, and that's that they're only getting better. So, I say, do believe the hype and check out Franz Ferdinand."
3,Good for what it is,"If you want dance rock, then this is your band. Emphasis on the dance part. I love British rock, including bands like Blur, the Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays. And all those bands knew how to make music you could dance to. But unlike this band, they also knew how to write real rock songs and perform them with soul. Franz, though obviously very technically talented, seems a little superficial. A lot of their songs sound like Blur's ""Boys and Girls"" minus the funny lyrics and clever musical touches."
1,This could have been so much better,"Seriously, am I the only one not blinded by the hype? Am I the only one who actually hears this album? This albums is a perfect example of why we even have terms like ""Sophomore Slump"" and ""Sellout.""""Do You Want To"" is the cheesiest song of the year with horrible lyrics and an irritating riff. Why anyone would listen to this more than once is beyond me. The title track is so horribly horrible and boring that I'm not even going to try and come up with something clever. It just sucks.The rest of the album isn't much different. They seem to have been reading the titles of too many Ramones songs. Their favourite word is ""wanna"" and they don't use it as well as Joey Ramone.I love their debut. Maybe the best album from last year. This album can't be their debut's toilet paper. If someone tells you this is a really great follow-up, don't listen to them. I wasted 20 bucks on this, don't make the same mistake."
1,WARNING: DON'T BUY THIS!!,"If you buy the CD, you can't rip it to itunes or any other player--which is how I listen to 100% of my music now. Download it from itunes: it's cheaper and you can make yourself a copy that'll work anywhere. I'd take this back to the store in a heartbeat if I could. It BLOWS!!!"
2,Remixed old Herman's Hermits songs.,"Franz Ferdinand's debut album had songs truly unique, but this new album is just a rock remix of old Herman's Hermits songs with slightly different lyrics."
2,It Should Have Been So Much Better,"Really, what do people hear in this group? Reading some reviews, they sounded interesting, and I enjoy some of their influences. However, after hearing both of the first two records, I can only conclude that the bank lacks both musicianship and strong songs. There's just not enough interesting material here to prop up an album, and even the obviously commercial ""singles"" are somewhat boring and derivative. These guys would be better off honing their skills a few more years before being thrust before the world by the media as the next big thing. Also, the mastering courtesy of notorious record-ruiner Howie Weinberg is an abomination."
1,just part 2 to there debut,"nothing much here truth be told.this album basically is part 2 to there debut album.another over-hyped act who has a few commerical sounding songs,but nothing that appears to make them stand out anytime soon.i expect another 2-3 albums to follow a blue-print that sooner or later will have them out wearing there welcome."
3,"Excellent debut, lackluster followup","I really liked Franz's debut, and so I was really hoping this album would be amazing. Sadly, I was wrong. This is just the boringly average follow-up you'd expect from a band like Franz Ferdinand. BUT, if you really, REALLY loved their debut, and want more of the same (along with some Beatles-y ballads and a few added flourishes), then by all means, tack on an extra star or two and buy it. But if you're tired of all this dancepop nonsense flooding currently flooding the scene, skip it."
1,Don't Buy Dualdisc,"The album is excellent, but the Dualdisc format is problematic -- it doesn't play in all CD players, and many folks online have reported that it can't be recorded into iTunes."
5,You people find this HIGH TECH!,"Okay mainly none of you wrote a report about the fact that this is a fantastic album instead you perfer to critsize the fact you can't play it on your computer. Yeah you can i'm listening to it of iTunes right now. Make sure you have the side that says CD up. But enough on techonical issues this is a great work unlike alot of what Mtv force feeds us with a bunch of hideous rap(I mean you hardley see good rap now a days). Franz Ferdinand always has a wonderfull orignal sound which is good since alot of bands sound the same now a days. Songs like The Fallen, Do You Want To, This Boy, Evil and Heathen, and the song name after the album(or the other way around. I don't know.) You Could Have It So Much Better. We don't need to have it better with a album like this were abouslutly fine."
5,Extraordinary,"An extraordinary second album, it's even better than the homonymous.Songs filled of intelligent lyrics about a group of people living in an industrial and decadent city. The stories are from Glasgow but, like all local stories, the identification is global."
4,DualDisc does not have surround sound,"The four stars I'm giving is for the music on the disc. But here's my warning about the DualDisc format of this album: even though the track listing here on Amazon.com suggests that the DVD side has the album in 5.1 surround sound, that is *not* true. If you read the label on the album, it says ""enhanced stereo"".Getting a surround sound mix is the only reason I would ever buy a DualDisc and this one doesn't have it. The extra video content on the DVD side is not really worth the extra cost. Get the CD version of this album."
2,disappointing,"To me this is nothing like as good as their debut album. The songs are less interesting, less catchy, less memorable. I tried to like it, I've played it through many times now, but it just isnt growing on me at all.It's not as if they've changed their sound much either, although they have upped the tempo a bit and it's a bit more ""in your face"" but really I think they could have done with taking a bit more time making this album."
3,Interesting...,"Hmmmm....I didn't like Franz Ferdinand's last album, but this one shows some good improvement. Yes, there are some awkward moments and some lyrical blunders, but You Could Have It So Much Better is actually not that bad. I like to see that they had made strides to improve their music."
4,Some dark lyrics hidden behind some catchy music...,"Consider my rating a strong 4 star. I'm not exactly sure why I fail to give Franz's CD a 5 star rating. After several listens, I believe it's because the CD, as a whole, gets a little repetitive in its musical stylings - just a little.The music is catchy. I was boppin' my head and just having a great time. What makes me chuckle is simple; the lyrics are not light and frivolous. It's a fun juxtaposition of catchy music and fairly serious/angry lyrics. The tone, at times, almost had me wondering if the lead singer was sneering at the listener.One can hear bits and pieces of different bands from the seventies and eighties - new wave. Overall, this is a great listen. I will be purchasing their 1st CD."
4,Dance away,"FF is known to ""make girls dance"". That's kind of their mission statement. But I like how it breaks down in the middle to give you chance to catch your breath."
2,Detached competence pervades,"2 1/2Typical sophomore from the type of indie group unable to deliver on any over-hyped promise to begin with, FF play it safe and in effect are still able to coast by on the small amount of talent they do have."
4,Well do you,"While not as fond of this release as their first, it's still a frequently played catchy sound. Their energy is refreshing and doesn't feel contrived. All-in-all I like it."
3,"Don't understand the ""hype"" about this band...",They arent bad at all but I dont understand what 's the hype about them. Will anybody remember them a few years later?
3,Taking themselves out of the spotlight: debut album v2.0,"What do you do when a pretty good band records a pretty good sophomore album... that sounds pretty much like their debut album? Answer: you give them one less star in your Amazon review. That's EXACTLY the case with this year's ""You Could Have It So Much Better"" by Franz Ferdinand.The band almost literally photocopied their first album, to the point that I would challenge someone who hasn't heard them before, to tell a song as belonging to one album or the other. Not that they put together a poor album: far from that, but they stuck to the ""proverbial"" formula. As much as they stood out in 2004 with their debut, this time around, they became more of the same..."
1,perfect example of what is wrong with commercial rock music today,"When major music publications such as Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, and Blender all agree that a particular album or band is the next big thing, chances are they suck. Case in point--Franz Ferdinand. They should have just slapped a 'the' at the beginning of their name and an 's' at the end, because they're just as horrible as The White Stripes, The Hives, The Strokes, and the rest of those trendy alt rock bands. Franz Ferdinand is a perfect example of what is wrong with commercial rock music today."
1,"[Track 2] + ""do"" + [Track 3]= Franz says, ""Yes!""","[CD TITLE] + ""if you only listened to better music"" = my review."
1,Dissapointing follow up.,"This is a let-down compared to their debut. The singles ain't too good either. You Could Have It So Much Better peaked at #8 in the US, but by its 5th week on the chart it's at #83, and is flopping bad.Their debut is soooo much better!"
4,Better than their debut,"First of all let me say that nothing on here tops ""Take Me Out"" from the first album. The album itself however is actually better than the first one. The band sounds more confident, and really lets loose. ""Do you want to"" is this album's ""Take me out"" and doesnt quite live up to its predecessor. The album sounds more complete with a good mix of high energy songs and slow ballads. It's the kind of album that needs to be listened to from beginning to end to really appreciate it."
4,Paul and John the revelators,"a vivacious and infectious release that injects new blood into the world of pop music. One must, however, be willing once again to embrace the powerful Beatles' influences all over this work. Obviously, with bands like Travis and Keane (as well as all the others, including Tears For Fears on their latest) the listener has become used to hearing references and sounds straight out of the Liverpool pantheon. That's not always a bad thing. Just be prepared to accept it first before moving on to all the unique qualities of the latest wave of Brit rockers.For a cleaner and arguably better produced release, check out the new one by Depeche Mode, Playing The Angel. It's a nice counterpoint to FF."
1,This disk is gargage,"Don't get me wrong, the music is fantastic. One of the best audio disc's I have bought all year. The tech is garbage. I couldn't play it on any of my computers (3 different ones) and that's the only way I listen to music. I refuse to purchase music twice and they seem to think that this is software, not music. Next thing they're going to have EULA's on music CD's. I will then finally just listen to vinyl."
4,Just as good probably better,"Franz Ferdiand isn't a band that is going to change your life but they are band that will provide some of the best foot-tapping music and make the most entertaining music out there with smiles on their faces. You could probably say that they had a sophmore slump because they didn't churn out all of the those memorable songs like ""This Fire"" , ""Come on home"", ""Dark of the Matinee"" etc instead they made some great softer songs like ""Walk Away"" which is probably my favorite song on the album. This is less of a rock of an album and went in a slightly different direction which I didn't expect because I figured they would have felt pressure to make another ""Take Me Out"" and would take an entire trying to make a song that was just as hit worthy as that song was. They didn't, I am glad and this album is awesome. Buy it if you wants some fun music with some swagger."
3,"I like Franz Ferdinand, but a lot of their songs sound similar.","Franz' first album had songs that all, for the most part, sounded very different from each other.However, to me a lot of the songs on ""You Could Have it So Much Better"" sound alike.The songs that DO sound profoundly different are:- The Fallen- Walk Away- Do you Want to- Fade Together- Outsiders- Eleanor put your boots on.The rest of the album is 2-3 minute up beat songs that I honestly think sound very similar.I'd reccomend purchasing The Fallen, Walk Away, Outsiders, and Do you Want to as downloads."
5,One word.... Genius,This is the most incledible album out there. I knew it was gonna be good but they have totally taken it to a higher level. They have set he standard for extrordinary music and i really berlive that this is the single best album ever produced. I listen to the whole album at least once a day.
1,"This is a consumer warning, not a review of the music","This CD installed trojan-horse spyware on my Windows-based computer, without informing me. My company had to reinstall Windows, after erroneously purchasing a new optical drive, thinking that was the problem.SONY/BMG releases contain spyware. This is not rumor, it is now reported in the mainstream news (...)YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RIP MP3s OF THESE SONGS, and play them on more than one device, as the CD is currently formatted. Think on that. Plus, you will have your Windows permanantly altered with tracking software.I would avoid this and all other Sony/BMG releases until this issue is settled. In the meantime, perhaps artists could stick up for their fans and demand that the record company do better."
5,great for fine hair,"I have very fine hair that is usually bogged down by hair serums and seems greasy. This lotion doesn't do that, makes it shiny and less fuzzy. I color it too and this briings out the highlights. I wish it were available locally. Wonderful stuff!"
2,A bad decision,"If you buy this book, you will make the 22nd worst decision.The examples included in the book are not based in actual business decisions, irrespective of what the title says,althuough in the discussion of the examples chosen, the author tries to link the example chosen with daily business situations,with irregular success.Personally, I feel cheated by a misleading title.If you are a middle-to high manager, there is nothing there for you"
3,A Solid Effort!,"Great authors, historians, musicians, and sports stars are usually included in end of the year ""best"" lists. Managers rarely show up on such lists. This book highlights 75 history-making management decisions that changed the way we think, live, and work. The decisions profiled remind executives that great management requires experience, vision, the ability to take risks, and good luck. This entertaining volume also covers 21 truly mistaken management decisions, a valuable contrast. We [...] recommend this book to executives and managers who would like to be able to recount colorful war stories about some ups and downs in the evolution of management."
2,Cheaply made product,I was a bit disappointed at the way the product was made. The reception is good. The phone fits well on the base and the base is wall mountable.
5,A Revelation!,"I bought this CD used at a local shop out of sheer curiosity. When I put it on my player, I was immediately impressed by the purity of Ms. Jhaveri's voice. If you tend to generalize about Indian female singers in thinking that their voices are bit nasal (à la the Carnatic vocalists...Ms. Jhaveri comes from the Hindustrani tradition) or a bit thin (like Bollywood legend Lata Mangeshkar) then this CD will be great surprise. Ms. Jhaveri's lovely voice is mesmerizing and at the end of the 3rd song, she adds a second track of her voice that provides a low-key murmuring (and non-gimmicky!) counterpoint to the melody. Harmonium and tamboura provide gauzy supporting wash in the background that adds to the dreamlike quality of the music and it is driving by tasteful rhythms on the tabla."
3,Decent movie but series is better,"This is a good flick for David Duchovny fans. It's an interesting movie but the Red Shoe series is def. better. The movie was a little cheesy and over the top at times. As for the series, I reccomend Girl On A Bike and Four On The Floor."
5,Betty Boop Review,I will let my grandaughter write this review as she is the owner of this watch!!I like this a lot and wear it all the time. My girlfriends all like it and always want to know where I got it! I think it is terrific!!Brook Wunder
1,SAME OLD SAME OLD,Love Man. Steam. BUT wish that he would come out with different compositions.This DVD is a waste of money if you have previous Christmas presentations.Donated it to GoodwillJohn
4,Music great but thats about it,I really liked the music. Keep in mind this is a Christmas show. I didnt care for the videos while they were playing the music much though. This is definitely different than anything I have listened to. Overall its great to have and play for Christmas Eve while hanging with family.
4,Christmas Concert,"For any fan of their music, the DVD -- Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Live is a must buy. Given the price of concert tickets and the shortage of time around the holidays to attend a live event, it is great to be able to ""attend"" a performance in the comfort of home.This DVD was filmed in 1997 during a performance in Omaha Nebraska, the home of Mannheim Steamroller. Filmed twelve years ago, the DVD reflects the live concert experience. The visuals are lovely, but they are not flashy, so keep that in mind. That said, in no way is the concert experience diminished. The DVD print is crystal clear and the sound is rich and has plenty of depth. It is perfect to play while wrapping gifts or baking cookies."
5,magnificent,This is an excellent concert of MS..dont hesitate to buy..if your a fan of their music..this is the dvd for you
3,Great music - B-O-R-I-N-G Video,"This is great Manheim Steamroller music. I listen to it every year. But the video will put me to sleep every time if I try to watch it.Part of the reason is because a lot of the music is pretty mellow, and it's all instrumentals, which is fine for background Christmas music but makes for boring videos. Also because the videos just don't relate to the music - Specifically the 14th or 15th century-style dancers.Get it for the music, but plan on other activities while it is playing."
4,the second dvd,"The first dvd was corrupted. The sound was distored, as well as not even. It would get loud, then drop in volume, then get loud again and did not sound right at all.The replacement dvd was very good. Sound was even and consistent. However, I do not understand that why the second dvd is different from the first. The begining of the the first is different from the second.Either way, the second dvd is good and I will enjoy watching it durning the holidays.Victor Morales"
1,Do not buy this DVD,This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased. I could make a better video using my cell phone. Close up shot's of waves or plant life and even a dog does not show the true beauty of Maui.Do not waste your money on the video!
1,Disappointing!,"Nothing but scenes of water - no words - only sounds of water - actually looked like Malibu lagoon - no proof that this was anywhere near Hawaii! I kept watching hoping that I would learn something about Maui....nothing, nada, zilch!!!!This purchase was a total waste of money."
2,I'm from Delaware,"Being from Delaware, thought this would be good to have and remind me of back home. Not. It is rather simplistic and boring. Would not recommend it and don't feel it represents the delicious and varied cuisine that I remember."
5,Beyonce is back!,"After leaving Destiny's Child on great terms, Beyonce comes back STRONG with this fantastic single, which is now number one in America! Who needs rock when you have Beyonce, the original true diva? Get this single now or prepare to be ridiculed."
1,Horrible.,"I usually like Beyonce's songs, but this has got to be an exception. I really don't think there's anything good about this song! The beat is irritating, there is no apparent melody, and the lyrics are just lame. Slim Thug doesn't do anything to improve the song. Sorry, Beyonce. This has got to be the worst song of the year."
1,Check This Out: This Song Is Wack!,"I heard this song on radio several times before I realized that the song was by Beyonce. I've never admired Beyonce's music style because she's mainly pop with very little substance. ""Check On It"" has to be the worst song so far in 2006. The video is just as awful, showing Beyonce caked with make-up, scantily clad, and shaking her behind. I thought she looked ridiculous, especially with that matted cat fur on her head. Basically, the song is about shaking your booty at the club and giving some perverted scumbag permission to grind into the back of you. That's one of the reasons why I stopped going to the clubs a long time ago because that type of ""dancing"" is just plain vulgar. Anyway, the song sounds better without the guest rapper (Slim Thug), but it's still an awful song."
1,Her worst recording to date,"this is the worst R&B; song i've ever heard, seriously.i like the beyonce in ""the closer i get to you"", ""dangerously in love"" and ""so amazing""guys don't you listen to this garbage"
1,A Bit of a Disappointment,"The sticker on the front of this CD stated that it contained the Album Version of ""Check On It"" taken from Destiny's Child #1's and also contained remixes. After taking the wrapper off and to my surprise, that sticker covered over the bottom right corner where it states that this CD does not contain the Album Version. I just wanted to get the version of this song featured in the new THE PINK PANTHER film. However, that version is not on here. All the cuts on this CD are just remixes. The back of the CD states that that version is available on the soundtrack to THE PINK PANTHER. However, when I checked the soundtrack it states that Beyonce does not perform on that CD. I am totally confused and disappointed."
5,Beyonce rocks,"I received A Beyonce concert DVD as a stocking stuffer this past Christmas. Prior to that, I didn't own any of her or Destiny's Child music. Then I saw her perform ""Single Ladies"" on the Grammys? Anyway, I was hooked and researched most of her work. ""Check on It"" is from a few years ago and includes Destiny's Child but still fits in with todays music. Great song to clean and drive to!"
3,Mean analog and chop vox make mad groove.,"In this side project from God Lives Underwater, the industrial penchant for driving sound comes through beautifully while maintaining (or establishing) some kind of super-pop house feel. The analog skill Mass Hystereo wields is astounding, and it's hard not to be drawn along. Although extraordinarily professional and distinctive, the percussion left me feeling somewhat cheated as it failed to truly interface w/ the melody. All in all an excellent single. Anyone hungry for a taste of pseudo-80's technocore, face-lifted and polished by soft-spoken electric handlers should totally scope this disc."
1,"The bottom of the barrel. Bland, flavorless dance music at its worst.","I fished this out of a discount record bin after being amused that any retailer would even bother selling a CD that they had marked down to $0.50. I still think I overpaid. Mass Hystereo is an exercise in the most banal, generic of all dance music. It sounds something like a watered down Crystal Method - a blend of big beat and acid house, but in a boring repetitive manner and without anything to set it apart from all the other material out there.It's totally flavorless music like this that gives dance music a bad name in some circles. God Lives Underwater is responsible for some interesting music, but this side project is so by-the-numbers and unremarkable, that I have to wonder what Jeff Turzo was thinking when he made this.Keep away."
4,Window works now!,My husband and I repaired the window motor in my '98 Olds Intrigue with this product. Works like a charm now! The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the lack of instructions for installation. We did find a terrific video online that helped us complete the project (with only one leftover screw) in less than two hours.
1,Complete Waste of Time and Money,"Spend the money on anything else. Historically inaccurate, biased in some places to the point of bigotry, and without value even for someone with little or no background in the subject."
4,Love this phone,This is my first cordless phone and I love it. My only problem is that after about 2 years of use I now have to replace the battery in the handset because it doesn't seem to hold a charge- I don't know if that is normal wear- I've heard that rechargeable batteries lose their life after so many charges. Other than that I'm very happy with it
4,Engaging,"I am not a climber but become hopelessly addicted to the mystery of Everest nonetheless. I enjoyed reading this heartbreaking tale of Everest as it opens another window into what climbers face on the mountain. Honest and informative, at times it painted a very different picture of a journey onto Everest. If you have an interest in Everest, climbing or enjoy the thrill of adventure than you will enjoy this book!"
2,Being Blunt,"I liked the first book and was happy to buy the second (third has such bad reviews I am not even tempted). I have stopped reading even though I am 75% done. I just can't read anymore how much a fool the heroine makes of herself. She is an absolute idiot. The eldest brother, who I disliked in the first book, doesn't learn his lesson and repeats stupid acts. Seriously, all the people in these books are morons."
3,"Use of professional porn stars with more actings, not as natural.","I was hoping to see real people, not professional porn stars. Cuz it does make the DVD seem more like a porn movie instead."
3,Decent,"Not porn, not bad. You can watch this with the wife and she will not be grossed out. Tastefully done. I gave it a three based on the repetitiveness. Positions are reused based on a different location, not new positions. Not a whole lot of surprises."
2,Educational for the newbie,"This product was received with great anticipation, hoping to find something new and exciting for a married couple of 19 years. Unfortunately, most of these sexual positions were minor variations of a few known (common) positions that are typical for any adventurous couple. The best portion was the guide to pleasurable anal sex, which was beneficial and even helpful with a few suggested pointers from the narrator.Overall, i (personally) did not find the product as exciting or as beneficial as I would have liked. I do believe they could have shown a little more variety in the number of positions rather than variation on a few positions. If this is the best the narrator/producer has to offer, perhaps she should have titled it 'The Complete Guide to the Few Sexual Positions I Know'... seriously...Best Target Audience: Newbies or the conservative who wants to 'gently' display something new to his missionary wife.Anyone want to buy a 'viewed ALMOST once' copy?"
2,Don't wast your money,The actors in this dvd must come from the porn film business since they shave their pubic hair off. As for learning anything you would have to be a child to get anything new from it. The girls in this dvd are cute though.
3,COMPLETE GUIDE TO SEXUAL POSITIONS,I DID NOT CARE FOR THIS DVD AS IT WENT OVER THE SAME THING FOR A LONG TIME THAT IS WHY I ORDER A BOOK AND LIKE IT A LOT BETTER
4,"Great math, too much reading","My son likes the Blaster series and the math part is great. However, most math software allows a non-reading math wiz to use them. Usually written items are accompanied by spoken words, or you can click on the words to have them read to you. Not so here. So my son is forever calling me over to read the instructions to him. Once I do, he can do the math part just fine and enjoys it."
4,Love this series!,"Belle Day accepts a job as a live-in physical therapist to the daughter of Cage Buchanan. Cage suffered a loss in his past and has held a grudge against Belle's family for years. Having someone he considered the enemy under his roof bothered him..especially when where he really wanted her, was in his bedroom.....I was excited to hear that this was being released. Fans of the Men of the Double C series fell in love with the Clay family, which Belle became a member of when her mother married Squire Clay. This book was wonderfully written and was not lacking in any way. My biggest dissapointment is the only Clays mentioned by name, besides Squire, were Tristan and Sawyer. The best books written in this series were the stories of Jefferson, Matthew and Daniel, and not to see these characters mentioned by name was dissapointing. Although this book is not in the same league as ""Stay"", it is a worthy addition to this series and a must read."
5,AWESOME,I Got mine on clearence at Sports Authority for $75!!!!!!!!!! Feel like they were broke in out of the box. Really comfortable and lightweight
5,A+,"This line of boots came highly recommended to me, I second that opinion. Used them for 4 days straight on an AZ dove hunt. Outside temps ranged from mid 80s to 115 degrees. Sure it was hot but my feet were comfortable and after being on my feet all day long, I didn't have any complaints. They did take a couple of hikes prior to my hunt to break in, but they softened up quite nice. Boot has great traction on various terrain. Quality built. Would recommend to anyone. I have the uninsulated model but you should consider insulated ones if you hunt in cooler climates than I do."
1,Danner Men's Pronghorn GTX-Leather,"This boot was suppose to be waterproof, it leaked as soon as my husband started using it, we did return it and got a refund."
3,Chips Easily,"This is a wonderful size mug and I use it for hot tea. Nice color, but they chip very easily. After only a few weeks there were chips on the top edge.Fortunately, those chips are not sharp so I have continued to use the mug. Also, after the initial chips appeared, I have not noticed any new ones. So it seems each mug developed 2-3 chips and then stopped."
3,Does what I needed,Had a tight spot to plug in a transformer so I got this. And it works. It's about the quality you'd expect for the price. So I wasn't sure if I should rate it higher as it was about what I expected.
1,An incomplete set,"Amazon doesn't tell you that this book is Volume 1 of 2. Additionally, when you receive the book and find out it is 1 of 2, you can't buy Volume 2. Apparently what is needed is the following ISBN, which is supposed to contain both volumes: 1-58976-287-8. Very poor identification on the Amazon website."
1,Do not buy this book,"This is a cheap, poorly constructed book that is certainly not worth the money. The CONTENT is not bad - it is the cheap quality of the book, like it was made on a copy machine. You also cannot read the very pale type. I would try to get my money back but for ten bucks it's not worth the effort."
5,Amazing interpretation --- J. S. Bach would surely approve,"A print reviewer said it all: ""chamber music making of the highest order.""Guaranteed, you have not heard Bach played with more subtlety and substance. Just seven artists, sounding like the whole world, revealing the inner workings of the ""Grand Master."" Let us have more!"
2,Disappointing,"Covey's point about the importance of trust is most worthwhile, but his behavioral suggestions on how to achieve it are mostly a rehash of ideas already out there, and on almost all of his points as the book goes along, he merely skims the surface of the possibilities rather than providing depth."
3,The Speed of Trust,"I didnt think it was the best of Coveys work that i have listened to or read before. It was OK, but nothing I would really recommend"
3,"Great points about Trust, somewhat lacking in reality","The Covey's do a great job of writing books which appear on the surface to be the key to life and everything successful in it. The problem is by taking stories of successful people, ignoring the thousands who did the same thing and failed, the conclusions result in weak statistical validity. But their ideas are important to learn, and offer value to leaders. There are lots of lists for trust development, etc, in this book. I would liken this more to Airport Leadership books, the ones people find in the airport book store and read before a big corporate power meeting. It is always a laugh to hear people quote from these books of the month. Key to this book, take away the importance of trust, but cut through much of the light stories and ""data""."
5,Great Book,Bought this book as a gift for a friend and it was truly amazing to see how they liked the messages which were delivered within the simple contexts which were put forward by the writer.Great gift for a great friend.
4,Speed of Trust Brings You Up to Speed,"The Speed of Trust will bring you up to speed on how to build trust in a (mostly) business world. Covey shares personal experience and anecdotes that break up the ""business"" model the book relies on to promote it's message. If you can get past this ""business"" model, the premise can be helpful to entrepreneurs, entrepreneur wannabes, parents, and anyone in a position of leadership. (Which includes most everyone on the planet.)I especially enjoyed the direct quotes sprinkled throughout the text, and the analogy on how trust, or lack thereof, can be an asset or a deficit personally and financially. I hadn't thought of trust in this way. So it's worth a read or two. It definitely can cause a paradigm shift."
3,"So Poorly Written, I Could Not See the Message","A friend and collegue called me from a, ""Speed of Trust"" workshop, and said that I had to read this book - it was so great. My friend is a decent writer himself, and I trust his judgement. However, he did not actually read the book. He attended the workshop. From that I conclude that the workshop and concepts are probably good, which is why I gave it three stars instead of two. Nevertheless, I could not get past the poor writing. I struggled through the first two chapters and had to set the book aside."
5,"For leadership training, this is the pinnacle","Having read many leadership related books and been trained in many seminars, nothing compares with the guiding principles in this book.This book should change the way you think about how you lead and who you lead. It not just inspires, it changes you to be a trusted leader. The result? You change for good the world around you!The negative will say this is idealistic, but in reality it is possible with those that commit to the importance of these guiding principles.The bottom line is that most organizations are disfunctional because of low trust cultures. However, you can be the one penetrating these cultures strong trusting leadership.The question is: can you arise to the challenge of being a true leader?This book defined my leadership roadmap for the remainder of my career."
5,A great read!,This book is a great read for anybody that is looking to improve their relationships in both their personal and private lives. I personally found it an easy and enjoyable read. I am going to lend my copy to fellow co-workers and see if we can all implement some of the ideas in the book.
5,Amazing transformative book,"After I read this book, I gave it to the head of our department. He wants to meet to discuss using it in our department. Sorry I don't have time to write more."
2,"What is it, that the 5-star review readers are used to read?","After going trough this book, I wondered: what do the 5-star review readers normally read? How can one be seriously inspired by a book with a content this shallow? Maybe it's the same reason as why books like 'Help, the iceberg is melting' are so hugely popular: the illusion of control or influence is being sold well. As I found out through my work as a consultant, even readers with a masters degree, are fond of simplification and 'generic recipes'. Of course: reading this book won't make you a worse person and hopefully it will inspire some to really behave or act in a more ecological way... The 'brand' Covey sells well, that's for sure!"
5,A Keeper,"After attending a webinar on SOT, our team was so impressed that we ordered a copy for each of the team, and they review a chapter at each regular meeting together. It has bolstered our company culture."
4,No Trust No Life,"Great book; lots of useful tools to use everyday.What is ""trust"" ""Who is trustworthy?""""How to discover trust""""How to create trust""""How to become trustworthy""""What do you do when someone looses ""trust""""What is ""a little trust?"" ""What is a lot of trust?""""Are their different kinds of ""trust""Trust plays a very important roll in our daily lives with out it; we would be very lonely!"
4,Great Book!,"We are using it for a Leadership Symposium. I am a bit skeptical of Covey's theory of restoring a broken trust, but am hopeful of gaining insight that will lend itself to my business as well as personal life. I recommend purchasing."
3,Dianne Roberts is right!,"Great book for someone who hasn't read anything on the mechanism of trust. A short, pithy book would have worked well ..."
3,Trust is the root of any relationship or organization,"Self trust - just what is my agenda? Do I feel relevant? Can people trust me? All questions which I asked myself while reading the book. I particularly liked the first line of his foreward ""How can a father ""brag"" on his son and still be credible - particularly regarding a book on trust?"" How many times do we tell that little ""white lie"" whether it's on a personal matter or a business related one?As a manager, trust is paramount. It could be the different between an effective or an unproductive staff. It could also be the difference between meeting an organizational goal or become a dismal failure.Covey takes us through a journey in understanding the answers within ourselves to these questions and moving outward. While we may say it's a given to ""recognize that each relationship has two trust accounts"", how often do we really stop to think about it? I believe that Covey's book helps to ask and answer those questions."
4,Tough Trust lesson,"The book will hit you right between the eyes if you read it with an open mind and objective perspective. My initial purpose of choosing this book was to help others. The tables were quickly turned. Failure can be a great motivator for me. I recently failed with a team. The book pointed out to me, very quickly, that I failed because I had not established enough trust with the team. I now know the steps in which the team is counting on me to provide before we can move forward together."
4,There is truth and important lessons in this book.,"Just like his father, Stephen brings incredible insights into what is important. He does a great job of demonstrating how must problems are caused by the simple breakdown of trust. Weather it be in others or ourselves, Trust is a fundamental need. The book follows a pretty logic order and method. While the print is a bit small, it's still pretty good reading and one of the many recommended development books that I suggest."
5,So true,I have certainly observed the effects of the trust issue in corporate life. I have worked in large professional service corporations where the loss of trust in the administration was a significant cost of doing business. It will remain an issue until the management reads this book and pays attention to it.
5,It's good to know that doing the right thing is also profitable,"In professional circles, sometimes its not been acceptable or hard to do what we know in our hearts as doing the right thing. Covey helps us understand that by doing the right thing we will be more profitable and effective. In essence, Covey's book gives us all ""permission"" to do what is right. Our organization held a seminar based on this book and received numerous accolades for sharing it with our community. The local school district, city management, and several other local governing entities have implemented study sessions within their organizations about the book's 4 cores and 13 behaviors. Its a quick enjoyable read."
2,Choose audio instead,"This was a rough read. Granted the author explains personal experiences as well as facets of trust, I would have preferred a seminar or audio version."
5,Bible for interpersonal relationships,Everyone must read this book. I wish I had read this years back. Highly recommended to anyone looking to make extraordinary relationships.
1,Kindle pricing,"I'm always stunned that the pricing for a Kindle copy is more than a new paperback copy of any title in Amazon. No production cost, warehouse overhead or labor. How can this be justified?"
4,Competence is the key,I've read many of the books and articles by Stephen Covey and his son and I believe this may get to the core of it all more than the others. I've always believed the Coveys have the wonderful ability to articulate common sense elegantly.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I was looking for a a book that has to do with personal relationships an not with organizational trust! THIS IS A BETRAYAL. THE TITLE SAID BUILDING TRUST THEY SHOULD BE MORE SPECIFIC AN NOT MAKE PEOPLES WASTE TIME AN MONEY, SO IF IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR TRUST IN PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS DO NOT BUY THIS BOOOK!!IM VERY DISSPOINTED"
1,Drowning in the Cruel Sea,"This classic story was totally ruined by a computer generated voice. We listened to this travelling interstate, and nearly ran off the road several times through sheer boredom...a monotonous disaster. Our last ebook 'Woman in Black' was good...so we were not expecting this type of presentation. Before purchase,can you indicate if the book is read by a real person or computer so we don't make that mistake again...otherwise you'll lose us!"
5,"Yes, it is","the best drama-at-sea novel of WWII, really, and stylishly written, by a professional writer who served as a naval officer. You not only believe he was there, you believe you are there. After reading it, one feels the weariness of war."
5,One of the most realistic accounts of sea life I've read,"As a cadet at the Coast Guard Academy, I have been searching for books that can give me an idea of what the seagoing officer experiences on a deployment. Monsaerrat's THE CRUEL SEA is by far the most realistic, vivid portrayal I've read about life on a small ship. From personnel problems to equipment failures to helping injured, dying sailors, THE CRUEL SEA covers a vast spectrum of nightmares and headaches aboard a small convoy escort. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in going to sea!"
5,Live through the war in the Atlantic - over and over again,"This is absolutely one of my favourite books, and I'm reading it for the 5th or 6th time right now.Based on his real wartime experinces, the author creates a fascinating story of ""one ocean, two ships, and some 150 men"". Living from day to day through the horrors of naval war in the North Atlantic with the wonderfully-crafted characters, one is only beginning to imagine just how terrible it must have been. You breathe with them, you fight with them, you sleep with them and you live through their good and bad times - finding yourself unwilling to put this book aside.Read this book, and Buchheim's ""The Boat"", and you can truly say: ""Now I know what it was like!"""
5,One of the best WW2 sea stories,"I don't know if Monsarrat was a naval officer in WW2 but it would seem so from the impression of reality when one reads this book. A must read for all naval buffs.Barry Pollock,Beijing"
4,The Cruel Sea,A very real story. Brings the reality of war at sea to life. A classic read for people that enjoy stories about the sea
4,First-rate historical fiction,"Well researched; faithful to the tragic and heroic historical events of WWII in the North Atlantic. History is only the backdrop, however, for what is, at heart, a novel whose main strength is its characters."
5,The Cruel Sea,"The Cruel Sea. Great sea story brought to life. How little me knew of the Atlantic convoys during WW II, and the dangers they faced. One of those hard to put down reads."
5,The Cruel Sea,"Mosarrat shows us that there is no glory in war, but much honor attached to the men and women of the armed forces. The Cruel Sea tells us how to behave during a conflict - be loyal, resilient, and have faith in ourselves and our comradesI re-read this book every few years and each time I am impressed with the characters, settings, and the lessons that Erickson and Lockhart teach us. And each time I feel better about people and their potentials. This book stays in the current section of my bookshelf."
5,love and war on the North-Atlantic during WW II,"It's a pity this book's out of print. I read it for the first time in a Dutch translation when I was 17 years old. It made a deep impression on me. When I read the English version, fifteen years on, this impression was even deepened. What the people on board of the cargo-vessels and warships that crossed the North-Atlantic during WW II had to endure is almost beyond description. Monserrat did a terrific job doing this. I was captured from the beginning to the end. I myself being a ship's captain was moved deeply by this story of the sea, the war and the movings of small human beings caught in between. Anything Alistair McLean might have written about this subject is put very much in the shadow by this terriffic book."
1,Broken Table of Contents,The Table of Contents is severely broken. It actually links out of the book and to the Project Gutenberg website. How awesome is that?
5,Mystery at the Inn,I have liked all the the Guideposts books. And the Grace Chapel Inn books are some of the very best. The characters are interesting and they help people who stay at their inn.
5,Memories of past,"Great disc, many of the favorites included. A must have for motown fans. I would recommend this disc to all."
1,Worthless,This book has no more info than the instruction manual. The little character strategy info (setences worth) they do have contradicts info posted by top players on DOAU forums. The screenshots for moves are very pixelated--they appear to be taken DOA2 on Dreamcast--the whole guide is probably rehashed from the DOA2 guide for Dreamcast. STAY AWAY
5,Comfortable and Classy,First shoes I've ever purchased on the internet. They are comfortable and classy with a true fit.
3,Quite honestly the last -but not the best,"Over the years a collector of Rumpole and his other works I have thoroughly enjoyed his writing, some to a greater extent than others.This, his last work ,I believe, is not memorable as it should have been.It appears to be aimed at a teen feminine market as many of the latest movies appear to be.This ,obviously is my own opinion but leaves me wishing for the wit and characters to be found in so many of his other works.The angst between the two main characters has its witty moments but on the whole fail,in my opinion, to achieve any high points."
1,"Quite honestly, I couldn't finish this book","I hate books where the point of view jumps from chapter to chapter. In alternating chapters, the story is told by Lucy and then by Terry. Thus the same material is covered twice. A great device for an author to double the page count, but repetitious and boring. Even though I liked the Rumpole series, I do not recommend this book."
4,some great psych garage,"This is a trippy little CD EP much worth having. The tunes by Dino Sorbello are outstanding (the ones by keys player Fastfingers not quite so much). But ""Psilocybe,"" ""Another Sip"" and ""Bardos"" are instant classics. ""Freedom Afterwards"" quite good with some rousing instrumental interludes. Playing overall quite good, especially the ""tight-but-loose"" rhythm section of Joe Chonto on drums who mixes tasty jazzy beats and fills and still bashes out the rock like nobody's bizniz and Starry Knight on bass who is always pushing the groove with a feeling. And Dino's imaginative guitar effects are always used to best advantage. A couple tunes suffer from poor mixing with the VOCALS WAY UP, but overall some cool stuff here."
3,"Great photos, short on content.","If you want a Tour book to go on the coffee table, this would be a good choice. It's got great photos ranging across the lifetime of the Tour and has enough written history to clue you into the major players from each era. But as a history book, it is too short on content to be taken seriously."
1,A Weak Entry In The Series,"Pride Of The Bowery finds the Eastside Kids at a CCC camp with a bunch of other ""kids"".Muggs (Leo Gorcey) can't seem to keep out of trouble in this film.The plot is thin, the acting atrocious, the production values almost non-existant.Best for fans of the Eastside Kids."
2,A joyless B movie,"This undistinguished effort (which seems like a promotion for Franklin Roosevelt's CCC camps of that time) is very disliked by most of today's film historians and critics. Though not a total turkey, it's still very slow-paced and, like the majority of the Bowery Boys/East Side Kids films, is badly dated. If there is a message in this movie, it gets lost in uninspired, forced humor, uneven scripting, and generally unappealling performances."
4,"Good Quality discs, Marginals cases.","I've used Imation products since 5 1/4 inch floppies.... Some are great some are not as great.. These are good discs, I can burn them in any of my burners REGARDLESS of disc color which is rare in this sort of thing.The cases however are another story. Thin and brittle they are not really up to the job of protecting these products.If you are going to use them in a camera or local are they'll be OK, if you are mailing them, choose elsewhere."
4,Great Gift!,"My husband and I have used a number of travel guides over the years and always found them helpful. When two of my friends/retiring co-workers decided to spend 6 weeks in the Rio Grande Valley including some time in Austin, San Antonio and the Texas Hill Country I did some research on Amazon for a travel guide as a gift.Knowing what they have planned I think this guide will only make their trip better. There are laminated maps, sidetrips to the Hill Country, restaurant recommendations, and shopping, shopping and shopping trip tips.I hope they enjoy the guide!I hope they enjoy their retirement, they have earned it! :)"
3,Good general information-not so good details,"This book served its basic purpose, however did not contain many specifics, for instance: it mentions to do a self guided walking tour of the King William District but they only give you the main street in the King William District--directions for a walking tour would be nice since there are several areas that aren't very worthy of a tour.The worst part of this book, however, was that the main San Antonio map had a critical HWY missing! It appears that HWY 151 was extended to HWY 90 several years ago, but the book has it stopping at the 410. This provided us with several overdriven directions until we discovered the error. I usually like Frommers but I think this one needs a little tweaking."
4,realistic yet hopeful,"I had RA for 20 years before finding a book about it I could connect with. Through Nies personal experiences, beautifully rendered, I started to analyze my own struggles and think about life style choices I have made and others that I need to question again. Her book compels me to question western medecine and realize that by listening to my body more closely, I can take care of my arthritis and my soul in a more fruitful way. A must read for any woman with RA at any age."
5,Love this Kettle!!,"I make coffee or tea every day, and this kettle gets some hard use at my house. I love it, the handle stays cool when the water is boiling and it doesn't release that much steam out of the spout. It pours extremely well, it has never dripped. I even use it for cooking as it boils water faster than in a conventional pot on the stove. I highly recommend this kettle!"
5,Very nice,"It works fast. Mineral deposits on the bottom, but not a big problem to clean. It is actually boiling water, not just heating it and also turning off at correct time. I have it for around 2 years. Works fine."
3,it boils water,"The product is all plastic with the exception of the heater coil inside. The lid breaks off easily. Other than that, it does boil water very fast. So, if you are a gentle person, then nothing will break and you will have a nice intact waterpot to use. :o)"
4,Works as Advertised,This kettle heats water fast and has a convenient base unit. The click it makes when done is enough to alert me in the next room that my tea water is ready.I am something of a noise-hater and I wonder if a kettle with a larger base area would heat water more quietly than this unit. But I am satisfied with this purchase.
5,Wonderful for tea drinkers,"My mom loves this. I bought it for her last year and bought one for someone else this year. Everyone I know who has tried it has loved it. Heats water quickly, wireless pour, and auto shut off!"
2,Lasted less than one year,"I would not recommend the T-Fal kettle. It just stopped working after less than a year. It was only being used a couple of times a day, and treated with care. Waste of money."
3,"Handy, but not designed for daily use.","This tea kettle certainly boils quickly, which is wonderful. I used this kettle three to four times a day. Unfortunately, this tea kettle must not be made to be used so frequently. It quit working after nine months of daily use. I was lucky enough to purchase it when amazon.com was offering it for $19.99, so I wasn't out very much money. I would say if you are going to use it once a day or less, then it's probably a decent purchase, but any more than that, look to another tea kettle."
5,The best kettle,Has endured two years of solid abuse in my kitchen. Fast and hot water is the continued result. Best kettle ever.
2,nice but not really a play toy,"This was exactly the plane my son wanted because it looks the way he wanted it to, but it is a model and within a few test flights the gas tanks on the bottom came off and then the tail wings came off. We have glued it several times because he really does love it, but wish it were more durable."
4,Wake Up America!,"There are some values that simply can not be measured. In the synopsis of SubUrbia, one can read of the plot in the book. The true power of the book, however, is not in its plot. The power is in the searing criticism of American society. Bogosian masterfully depicts the evils of American society through the actions and the very constitutions of his characters. These characters find themselves aimlessly adrift in the horse latitudes on the way to adulthood. Bogosian's wake up call to America is driven home when the abrupt ending is punctuated with crazed shouts from a foreigner"
2,cold tent,"cranked it up and froze my beans off, had a -5 degree bag and was still so cold i barley got any sleep."
2,Not as advertised,"Purchased this Blackcat specifically because it appeared to be the older, non plastic style and paid a bit of a premium over the new version. When it arrived I realized it was in fact the new version. Picture is incorrect. By the Blackcat cheaper from another reseller."
2,Fisherman,"Bought this to keep warm ice fishing. Not enough btu's. Great for a small tent or a camping trip just to keep the chill out. I have a 6X6 tent and on a 20* day or less, it's not enough. If you are looking to stay warm in cold situations, buy something else. Over priced product."
1,Should Have Listened to Other Reviews!,"Even though I read a review saying this product didn't work I bought it anyway because I needed it for job interviews. Well I ended up returning them. I have a BRAND NEW burner and CD ROM. These CD's are not recognized by either. The burn fails everytime and the CD ROM just spins the CD, then says that it cannot read it.Buyer Beware!"
4,Excellent information and pictorial review of ships.,"For the North American modern merchant ship buff this book supplies excellent data and pictorial information on the major shipping companies with service to the UK and Northern Europe. The only shortcoming, although plentiful, may be the black and white photo presentation, yet this also allows the book to be relatively inexpensive for the material contained. No book short of Lloyds Register will list all the world's merchant ships yet this effort covers a portion. I would suggest this to any merchant ship viewer or enthusiast."
3,"Nice, but not sweet.","I purchased this CD based on the previous feedback below. While I enjoyed the music in a lot of places, I did find that the music and lyrics became almost eery: ""Your time to die... your time to die."" Yes, it is simply talking about the life of a bee, but still, it wasn't sweet sweet sweet as I'd hoped it would be."
3,Aspen heavy,During my final year of undergrad coursework I used this textbook for my design courses. The good thing is Dr. Seader was the professor for my second design course. As a teacher I think he is great with an ability to effectively communicate theory and its practical application without getting caught up in the details. Unfortunately I felt this textbook tries to consolidate the knowledge he has gained in his career resulting in a very dense book. Some problems are solved using direct calculations but a large amount are done using Aspen (a program no one in my class had used) which I felt didn't adequately help develop sequential problem solving skills. The costing analysis theory is good but most of us used Peters & Timerhaus for homework. If you work with Aspen or want a detailed book this will satisfy your desires.
3,"incredibly thorough, but difficult to wade through","As my professor for this class put it, ""the good news is that this book is incredibly thorough. the bad news is that it's incredibly thorough."" tough for an introductory text on the subject, mainly because the notation is different from most other books i've used, and the style of writing is not quite as straightforward as could be hoped. if i could add one thing to this book, it would be a general overview in each chapter -- the authors just jump into each topic without introducing the bigger picture, so it's easy to wonder ""why are we doing this calculation?"" then again, maybe a professor could take that role during lecture. as another reviewer noted, this book does have an excellent review of thermo and mass transfer; it was only during this class that i started to really understand these two subects in any kind of depth."
2,Try Treybal instead,"The book is decent for an undergraduate course but there are numerous typos throughout the book and some of the HW problems are poorly written. The poorly written questions gave many of my students problems because the wording is confusing. Treybal is a much better book; unfortunately, it is a bit outdated and does not have all of the latest separations processes included. I will contiue to look for a better book. I will post the name of any other books I come across for those who are interested."
2,Not the best,"I was really excited to sell my book back once the course was over for this one. It is a really difficult book to read both to understand and to follow in any continuous sequence (I did pass, though with a decent grade). Several problems are quite confusing, especially in chapter 7 (many students had to see the teacher for clarification). It does give you some HYSYS/Aspen problems to work, which is nice."
5,An Essential Health Technique!,"EFT (Emotional Freedome Technique) is a stress release technique that involves tapping gently on a few easily reachable accupuncture spots on your body while focusing on your problems. This dvd does a great job of teaching the technique and includes real-life demonstrations of using the technique to releave problems. The people in the demonstrations are diverse. I believe this technique has value in relieving the daily stress of racism as well as other ""ism""s. The production is a bit dated and the delivery can be a bit stiff but the Mountroses are sincere and thorough teachers. I have several dvd's on EFT and this one and those produced by Gary Craig (the founder of EFT) are the best. Gary Craig'd dvd's are no longer available for purchase but can be rented."
4,Naikaku - Modern Progressive Rock From Japan,"Naikaku proved to be one of the highlights at this years ProgDay festival. They are an all instrumental band of young rockers from Japan who blend elements of fusion, heavy rock, jazz and even a bit of metal into their mix of music. Their sound is really unique, at time very heavy with loud crashing guitars and drums, while at times the move into almost jazz territory with plenty of outstanding flute. The flute parts will undoubtedly remind the listener of Jethro Tull at times, with King Crimson and maybe even Tool being other comparisons. These guys are great live and if you ever get the chance to see them check them out."
5,Spare and strong writing that seizes the power of ordinary,"This is a carefully crafted set of stories by a master. The prose is sinewy and firmly grounded in the real experiences of real people. Wolff has the short story teller's gift of transforming ordinary, mundane events into revealing glimpses into the human condition. Many of these stories deal with a generation of wanderers who came of age in the seventies and eighties in America. Regular people whose unremarkable lives suddenly jump out of an uninteresting pattern. These stories show the reader, if not the characters, how the smallest events and details can suddenly shape our experience of life and our understanding of ourselves"
3,Mildly Amusing,"An mildly entertaining collection of stories. Not exactly my genre and not riveting, but generally well crafted and diverse. Some interesting characters and ideas. Full disclosure: I rarely read modern fiction."
4,"Witty, charming and churning. Wolf gives us ourselves.","Simply, THE NIGHT IN QUESTION, is filled with quick witted, short stories, that subtly asks and answers the small questions of all our lives. The actions of the characters are filled with a regularity that we all can be empathetic towards, and yet also be surprised in the turn of events that face those characters with the questions of mortality, fear, and solitude. This is an easy read, and yet thought provoking. I would recommend to anyone who truly enjoys short stories."
5,Wolff's stories in Russia,"Reading the stories from ""The Night in Question"", I noticed close similiraties of his works to the ones of Anton Chekhov. Especially the first one, ""Mortals"". To tell the truth, I always thought that today's American Literature has only a-la Stephen King and Sydney Sheldon authors. It turned out otherwise. Tobias Wolff's book is so nice to read, that I even caught myself wishing to try and translate it into Russian. I'm sure Tobias Wolff is an international author."
1,[$$]? Not if your doing payroll!,"This product is very misleading, in order to do payroll you have to subscribe to the 'payroll tax service' from Peachtree, which costs [$$], twice the original product price. Sure, they say you can 'edit the tax tables' yourself, but this is actually entering an equation where you must know all the variable names the program uses."
2,It takes time to learn this software!,"If you dont' know anything about accouting, this is not the software for you. There are tutorials available with the software, but you must know the terminology first for it to make sense. There is a free trial of the full PeachTree Accounting available from Best Software, but be aware that if you try it out, you cannot transfer anything from the free trial to First Accounting, since they are different versions. You could spend a lot of time working with the trial and then have to do it all again if you buy First Accounting.I am able to handle a small payroll without subscribing to the payroll service, but it did take some experimentation and time to figure out how the user-entered tax formulas worked (there are two sample companies included with the software). There are a lot of options for computing taxes -- you don't have to use complicate tables, and simple formulas are available. But it wasn't easy and I am still learning."
3,An excellent refutation and understanding of Christianity.,"A concise book which explains the false beliefs of Christianity, such as the divinity of Christ and pagan parallels. The author refutes the myths of the Trinity and explains the apotheosis of Jesus, a prophet of God. A simple and solid refutation of Christianity and it's blasphemous assertions. Excellent reading."
3,Another great Kindle public domain book.....,"...and another serialized gem from Jacobs. This one is not a collection of tales, but rather a funny take on the sea-faring life: the philandering captain with a woman in every port. If you have never tried Jacobs before, his work is often hilarious (at least when the tale surrounds the exploits of Ginger Pete, the night watchman and other assorted seafaring types).This story has quite a few twists and some real chuckles as the captain finds himself having to endure the attention of several females and his first-mates pithy commentary on his actions. Definitely worth a try but by no means is this Jacobs' finest work....."
5,Wonderful spices-adds a punch of flavor to your food!,I love Rosie's Kitchen spices. A wonderful combination for enhancing all your kitchen delights. I have used them for years. Great tins for keeping them fresh as well.
3,didn't arrive packaged as picture,"i thought the picture looked like a well presented gift set, but it came wrapped in tissue paper, one on top of another and then in a gift bag that was too small. all in cheesy xmas print. i was willing to pay a little extra for a cute boxed up gift set, but it wasn't cute and now i feel it's overpriced.i bought this as a gift, so i'm not sure how tasty the spices are. we'll see how the recipient likes the rubs. i ended up rewrapping so he will never know how it arrived."
4,Good CB,The radio works as advertised. Clear and sensitive. Also a powerful transmitter. The controls are a little complex. The only true negative is how large the unit is. I have no place to mount it and it is too big to fit in the glove box. I had to set it up to rest on the dash.
5,Great Product,I just installed the DX-939 on my truck and decided to get one for my Motor Home. Then I noticed this Flame Thrower Special Edition. Wow! It`s $300 so don`t go breaking out your checkbooks unless you want the best rig on the road. Go to their site or ebay and read the specs. Everyone that I talk to is impressed. It`s the Flame Thrower DX-959 from Flame Thrower. It gets out farther and clearer than any one else. We put one in our Motor Home and man the responses were overwhelming.
4,"smooth reading, fun history","This book explained a lot to me. I selected over AC/DC based upon the reviews. I wasn't disappointed. Buy it, reading it, enjoy it."
1,Goes out of the way to make Edison less important than he was,"If you want to read a book about how cities from Paris, New york, Cleveland, down to Po Dunk Holler were awed by electric lights and how the gas industry felt threatened this is the book for you. If you are hoping for a book to confirm that Edison was a successful businesman and hard working scietist you want find it here. It's intersting the first time you read about a city being impressed by electricity coming to town, but to read it again and again is boring. It's a dull book and really not that informative. Do not waste your money."
2,KidKraft Fashion Dollhouse,"Unfortunately within only weeks of putting this product together, the wooden strip that supports the middle level ""bowed"" thereby making the cardboard floor fall through. We tried holding it together with duct tape but that didn't work. We were disappointed with the quality of this product."
4,"Nice dollhouse, not great quality","We gave this dollhouse to my 3.5-year old daughter as a gift this holiday season. She loved it, mainly the fact that it's so huge and she can play with her regular dolls in it. However, assembling this dollhouse was a pain - parts were mislabeled, one was broken and one did not fit. Took my husband and I almost 2 hours to put it together. And after only one day the cardboard floors on 2nd and 3rd levels started ""sinking in"" from the weight of the play furniture! So while my daughter loves this dollhouse, I am dissapointed with the quality and the difficulty of putting it together."
3,Barbie Doll House,"Although the doll house is nice, no average woman can put it together. It is a difficult project. Also, it is priced too high for what it is. It is not your normal doll house, being much larger. It seems to bore the children quickly."
5,a winner for an active child,"Jumping Jack the Grasshopper is an adorable book about a grasshopper named Jack who is looking for a friend. In the end, Jack leanrns that he doesn't have to be just like someone in order to be their friend...some friends wiggle, fly, and swim. My active 2 year old little boy will actually sit down to read this book as he hops the toy grasshopper ""Jack"" that comes with the book from page to page on his adventure, and he learns a valuable lesson."
3,3 minute timer,"Nowhere in this item's description or online did it mention that this is supposed to be a 3 minute timer. The packaging does, though. I needed a 3 minute timer, but the sand actually runs out at 2 1/2 minutes."
5,Couldn't be happier!,Received a great timer for CHEAP!Perfect fit & finish and holds consistent 3:00 min cycle rate. Buy with confidence!
4,"fun stories, faulty binding",A new paperback shouldn't shed pages on the first reading. My copy did that. But I'll re-read several of these tales and mend the book as I go.A fun assortment of yarns. Turtledove crafts Short Stories well. These stories give more insights into the Author himself than his novels do.
4,If you like SF its well worth your time!,Mr. T. is always a good read when one finds some down time. His characters are believeable folks one can identify. Who behave in ways that make sense when thrown into unusual sitituations. His plots while at first seen unlikey to the critical eye. They quickly grown and develope into a good story.
4,Splendid,"An immensely enjoyable collection of alternate history tales. This genre is growing more popular all the time and that is good, because we can learn alot from well written AH. It teaches us to appreciate the people who made things happen throughout the threads of time instead of taking them for granted. Departures accomplishes this."
3,Crazy Machines Style game,I love this kind of smart software for kids. I would give it more stars but it is dated.
1,Nothing like the original,"This game is reminiscent like ""stronghold crusader extreme"" on many levels; both reduce audio quality, add virtually nothing, and were a money gag.Even more contraptions added puzzles that were boring and unintuitive (not to mention weird). I was expecting something really fun, but, Sierra just wanted to squeeze the juice out of contraptions before it went into the oblivion.Buy ""return of the incredible machine contraptions"" instead, that is a game worthy of praise. Higher quality music, awesome puzzles, and simply a classic by Jeff Tunnell."
4,Great fun!,"""The Incredible Machine - Even More Contraptions"" is my first experience with such a game. It's very fun and pretty darned addictive! I actually bought it for my logically-minded son's fifth birthday, which I think was a little ambitious; he enjoyed putting pieces into play and fidgeting with them to get them to work, which was fun enough in itself, but I think the GAME might be too difficult for him. We'll see. He enjoyed playing it the one time, but hasn't begged to play it again. I, on the other hand, could play it all night long! :=D I haven't let myself, yet, but... I look forward to giving it another try. Regardless, I give this game two thumbs up! [Although I'm a little disappointed that it installed something on my computer AND still requires the CD to play the game. Huh?]"
1,Works great on a PC but,Works great on a PC but you are out of luck if you have a Mac. Too bad as this is a game that I will miss now that I have a Mac.
5,Parent of pre-teen and college kids,"I chose this game as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter, after reading the reviews on Amazon. This was the hottest gift in the household. My 19 year old son and 23 year old daughter and her husband all enjoyed the game. Everything about this game is well done. Good sound, graphics, variety, and appeal to various ages. It provided many hours of family entertainment and was a vehicle for building teamwork and self-esteem."
1,Bullet Proof? Not exactly,"I bought the product and went through trying to install BOTH shields included, ruining them both. I followed the directions properly and was very disgusted with the results. Little bubbles never came out.The company wants me to try it again, so I may get enough to make it worth my while on my iPod touch. So far, it has not been a walk in the park."
5,Worth every penny spent on it.,"Excellent product. Next time I will buy an iPod, I will never use it before having one of those installed. Looks like it came from the factory this way. Highly recommended."
3,Movie Night Fun,"This is a great flick for movie night with the guys in the man cave. With a few beers and some pretzels it makes for a fun evening. I own many of these old hot rod flicks and we try to get together at least every other month to ""Review"" at least one with some ""frosty beverages"". Recommended by ""The Guys""!"
3,Easy reading,"nice, varied stories told of the days during the war. Told through the soldiers and personnel of the era. Would recommend reading."
2,Rambling,This was not what I had hoped for. Though somewhat interesting you have to work at maintaining that interest. It rambles on through old English prison escapes but has trouble keeping the reader engaged.
3,no o-rings,"this filter was ok but did not come with the o-rings. No big deal, but would have been nice to know ahead of time"
4,"Not for everyone, but I sure liked it.","Its paradoxical, sardonic, satiric, and pedantic... its a glance into Sartre's life. I like it."
3,A guidebook on how to make yourself unhappy,"Want to live a miserable existence? Then hang out with people who avoid every possible form of humanly, earthly happiness. Mathieu has made a career of idling in the doldrums. His longtime lover--as punishment for being with him--is destined to the same fate, with or without him.The Age of Reason is a turgid descent into lonliness. It speaks about the intellectual culture of the time in the big city (Paris), which was pretty despairing. Well written and engaging, but terribly sad."
1,Defective Book Shipped by Amazon,"The first 3-5 lines of the following pages were poorly printed and the remainder of the pages were blank. The defectively printed pages were 291, 292, 293, & 294 plus pages 299, 300, 301, & 302. I have never before received a defective book from Amazon, in spite of the large number of books that I have purchased from them."
1,The Age of Selfishness,"Sartre's characters are shallow, self-centered worms bent on self-destruction. However, because of a broad streak of narcissism, they are unable or unwilling to do significant harm to themselves. As a consequence, they turn their destructive ambitions toward their unsuspecting, but nevertheless deserving, acquaintances. Each character is deluded in the belief that he or she is seeking some noble objective, for example Mathieu's quest for ultimate freedom, while in fact settling for cheap self-indulgence at others' expense. These characters are irredeemable and certainly not worthy of the several hours required to read Sartre's novel. One wonders which character, if not each of them, represents Sartre's alter ego."
4,MASTERFUL WOODCUT ILLUSTRATIONS,"Superbly illustrated with masterful woodcuts, Stranded at Plimouth Plantation is a thoroughly researched account of everyday life on the Plimouth Plantation.The journal of Christopher Sears, a 13-year-old orphan who is stranded after a shipwreck, is the starting point for this story of courage and excitement.An apt lesson in history for young readers."
5,Great Resource,This book is a great first hand account for the classroom. My students enjoyed learning about Plimoth Colony from the perspective of a boy their age.
3,Shocking,"Though not very well written, this book does not fail to disgust and numb me. The startling revelations made by Mustafa Khar's wife, Tehmina, are almost too horrifying to believe. However, surprisingly, this battered wife who claims to have suffered so much pain does not evoke any sympathy from me which I believe she tried to seek. The story is about a pakistani politician who brutally abused his wives, who wrongfully used Islamic law to his advantage and at the same time committed sins such as adultary, and even conducted an affair with his wife's sister. However, Tehmina herself got involved with Mustafa Khar while she was still married and she also broke up Mustafa Khar's marriage with his former wife. The book does not arouse as much curiosity as it should, and towards the end begins to command even less attention from the reader. The book does not deserve more than a 5"
5,"Not new, but still relevant","This book was the first recommended to me by a male friend in Pakistan when I visited there last year. Although not a new bestseller, it provides context for understanding Pakistan. Beware--it is not upbeat, but I found it thoroughly enlightening and helpful."
4,Interesting read,"I read this book during my flight from WA to Orlando,FL. It kept my interest and gave an accurate depiction of the history and traditions in Pakistani culture."
5,Great book,Great book! I can hardly put it down. The author really does a wonderful job of stirring your emotions for what she is going through.
4,Bold and daring stuff...,"This is an exceptional book because it presents in lurid detail how corrupt and immoral Pakistan's ruling, feudal elite truly is and how society turns a blind eye to this wretched evil. People who have felt this book was internally inconsistent and were confused by Tehmina's willingness to repeatedly reconcile with Khar, obviously don't understand the traumatic effects of physical spousal abuse or the social stigma divorce carries in a country like Pakistan. This book is not about extra-marrital affairs or adultory as some reviewers contemptuously try to paint it. It is about the struggle and eventual triumph of a victim against astonishing odds. Tehmina's tale will be a source of inspiration to many victims of spousal abuse in the world. Read her book, if only to familiarize yourself with their struggles."
5,Great,"OK, considering my age, my opinion may be ignored, but I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good book. This story covers about 20 years of Tehmina's life, discusses her early childhood, her marriage to Mustafa Khar, and the torment she was put through during her marriage. It wasn't very good for the impression people had of Pakistan abroad, but her frankness is remarkable. A good book."
4,Glad to finally see a Pakistani women speak out,I commend Tehmina Durrani for having the courage to write this book. I hope she continues her writing career and I look forward to reading more of her writings.
3,A never ending cycle,"Tehmina Durrani has managed to dramatize her life, and turn it into a soap opera.At the beginning of the story I felt pity for her, and for those around her who suffered as well. Soon my pity turned to puzzlement as I tried to determine why Tehmina always returned to Mustafa after divorcing him. This happened three times! She claimed to be miserable living with him, and yet she went back to her tormentor time and again.I couldn't stand reading about him abusing her - it made me sick to the stomach that she endured it in silence. I understand that Pakistani society had constraints, but how Tehmina managed to keep up the facade is beyond me.By the time she finally divorced her husband the novelty of leaving Mustafa had worn out. I just cannot comprehend how she could subject herself and her children to such cruelty."
2,"Not much new, writing about a failed movement.","Levitas' book is well written and documented but it doesn't contain much that is new. I've been reading about the radical right for almost 20 years now and there were no surprises here, only a rewritten version of what is in about 20 other books and reports. The subject has been exhausted and this book proves it."
4,Excellent Historical look at the evolution of domestic terrorism,"Levitas does a thorough job of looking at the historical developments of domestic terrorism in regards to anti-semitic and racial hatred. However, he does take a shot at conservative Christians that believe the U.S. was founded on Christian principles (and think it should stay that way) as he appears to categorize them with the ""extreme right"". Morever, as a law enforcement officer and former negotiator, he does take a pot-shot at police by characterizing them in one sentence as eager to kill ""cop-killers"" -- statements like these create concerns with the rest of the material when facts are juxtaposed with feelings."
3,"Not as good as their previous album, Empty","There are a few good songs that catch my attention on this album, but I can't get over the fact that they lost the guitars. I really like pure electronic music, but God Lives Underwater sounds a whole lot better with the electric guitar riffs to back up the keyboards. Many of these songs would have been great if they just had some guitar sounds in there to balance things out. Without them it just sounds...incomplete. If you buy only one God Lives Underwater album, get Empty. It's their best release in my opinion."
4,a few creative and catchy songs (the rest is trash),"GLU has a really unique techno/rock sound that I like. Songs I recommend are tracks 2, 3, and 5. I remember track 3 ""from your mouth"" playing on the radio a few years back, but GLU's denser tracks are far better in my opinion. A pretty solid CD that I would buy again."
2,Not my thing,"I really liked Mouth when I heard it on the radio, and I heard a few clips from the rest of the album. Plus lots of people seem to like it a lot, so I decided to give it a chance. The first four songs are pretty good, but then the rest I didn't like all that much. Then there's that crap at the end of the CD -- I was utterly amazed at the last track, which was a solid half hour of some slow, very low thumping and little else. What a waste of disc space. Perhaps I chose the wrong CD, because I like a lot of GLUW's stuff. Just make sure you listen to the whole thing before you buy this one."
2,Not worth your time.,"Aside from the lumbering, but still intresting single ""From Your Mouth,"" the rest of this album sounds muddled and un-intresting. The words are song un-emotionaly and some of the music sounds like it could be used on a TV action show like TJ Hooker. Don't wast your time with this."
2,bad,these guys did a bad job on this cd. about 2 or 3 decent songs and the rest of it i cant even remember what they sound like. thats a bad thing because if you cant remember it.. then it means you didnt like it.. empty and the ep were very good in my view but they really let me down with this one. no live instruments it would seem. these guys made a 3rd album and i've heard a song off it and it sounds really good.. but some record issues prevented them from releasing it.. and seeing how that was 2001 i dont think they are ever coming back. so that means this cd means it was there last effort to the public.. which is a shame..
2,Paying for so-called music,"This CD was a waste of my money (and time). I heard the song ""From Your Mouth"" on the radio, and I thought it was pretty funky, so I bought this CD. It is the only good song on this CD. And the sleeve contains nothing more than a big, stupid picture of a businessman walking off a table. I hope for a future where music can be returned if it is unacceptable, so bad artists like this won't make money."
5,Rock/electronic mix with muscle,"I first heard about GLU a couple of years ago when this album came out. The first time I heard it I was astounded. The music is a perfectly blended combination of Depeche Mode on 'roids, electronic beats and noises, and industrial guitar riffing. The Intro builds up and segues into ""Rearranged,"" a powerful anthem that turns up the intensity. ""The Rush is Loud"" amd ""Dress Rehearsal For Reproduction"" follow in much the same vein as ""Rearranged"" with loud, powerful choruses. ""Medicated to the One I Love"" is a little too long, but it works for the first 5 minutes and the last 3 minutes. This album will appeal to fans of guitar-based rock and electronic music along the lines of Depeche Mode, KMFDM, Nine Inch Nails, Stabbing Westward, and Gravity Kills. Recommended."
5,EXCELLENT RELEASE,"I agree with the first reviewer falzano, sums up what i think too in all honesty. Peter tagtgren really makes an album more industrial than previouse works, its more original to the genre. Not to degrade his other works, every release is awesome, memorable songs, but this one, hits the jackpot, cant wait for his next release!! worth every penny, you love industrial GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!"
2,Not good with #10 stranded wire,"Being a Leviton product, one might suppose it is the industry standard. Nevertheless, the connectors on the plug I got would not cinch tight on #10 stranded wire, which should be a very common wire type for this application (and apparently among the gauges the plug is designed for). I had to bend two ears on each terminal to get an improved fit when the terminal was screwed down tight. This took care of two of the three prongs, but it was still easy to pull the wire out of the terminal on the third prong. Unfortunately the third prong was the one that required some persuasion to force it into its proper position (the other two went in quite easily), and the wire kept slipping out.After enough fussing it all went together, looks good, and works fine; but I was surprised by the hassle."
3,Remember the red wooly men?,"The first disc or season 1 was excellent. Perfect pacing. Engaging plots and passable acting.The second disc changed the format of the show from a half hour thingy to a full houred marathon. It became too long and so became very boring. Chucked it into storage.If you get it, just watch the first disc and not mar your appreciation for this fine series by watching the rest."
5,By a drummer for drummers,"A really great book on sampling techniques. The chapters on loops heavily reference sampling. The MIDI chapters concentrate on drum sequencing. To get the most out of this book you will need to have a minimal investment in microphones and recording equipment. This book is written for those who really want to create their own sample libraries. The author emphasizes the difference between live track recording and sampling. The book is also useful to those who will use samples in their music, providing criteria to judge sample quality."
1,inaccurate garbage,"I would give this book a zero star rating if it was possible. As a professor of music technology, new books cross my desk constantly. This is hands-down the worst music technology book I have ever seen. It is chock-full of inaccuracies and is written in the style of a freshman term paper. The majority of the book is devoted to simple audio recording - a rehash of Gibson's other books. There is a small amount of information dealing with sample editing which is the one saving grace of the book. The MIDI information is simply WRONG. Finally, there is far-too-much filler writing about how Gibson dislikes hardware samplers but loves Macs, Steely Dan, and Toto. The book IS pretty, though."
2,Sorry but this book is not all that helpful....,"I was able to obtain this book through a bookswap. I read through it quickly in one sitting and am about to pass it along after spending a short time with it.I found Ms. Bernard's personal history boring and tedious and the tips that are contained in the last half of the book much better presented in other weight loss books.If you are serious about losing weight, I would suggest that one work through a program that combines a sensible diet, exercise, and mindfulness. The Beck Diet Solution: Train Your Brain to Think Like a Thin Person by Judith S. Beck is an invaluable book that integrates all critical components for weight loss success and healthy living."
3,no big surprise!,"I am sure that writing was very cathartic for Ms. Bernard, but I was hoping for a little inspiration. What I got was a feeling of DUH!! You mean, I have to eat right and exercise to lose weight? Of course we all know this. I don't know what inspiration I was hoping to gleam from the book, but I got little out of it.Overall, it was a fun read...but hardly helpful."
2,A litte bit of a let down....,I had trouble finishing the book. I did not find the inspiration I was hoping for as I have with other books. Writing down one's journey through weight loss is a daring move yet not all are worthwhile for everyone to read. I am in my late twenties and feel maybe this book is better for someone in their 30s or so given the age of the writer.
5,"""Progress, not perfection""",This is the best book on weight loss I've ever read! I laughed all the way through it and could relate to almost every piece of it. I found myself smiling and nodding in agreement repeatedly...sometimes cheering! If you've stuggled with weight issues for a good part of your life do yourself a favor and buy this book. A week after I bought it I picked up a copy for a good friend and she finished it before me. I will go back for a second read through very soon. Jami gives sound advice and combines personal experience with research and facts. I can't say enough about this book.
3,"I did enjoy the book, but....","I bought this book when it was plugged to me as a recommendation at a bargain price. I read half of it the first night, and parts of it were laugh out load hilarious. I do think it is worth the read. However, it was hard for me to finish for a few reasons. Mainly, not all of us are as well cultured, well traveled, and well off as the author. It was hard to feel sorry for her and especially to relate to her when she can go to spas, have expensive massages, go to the best gyms and have the best food (some of which I had no idea what it was since it appeared to be written in French).I did like her approach and style of writing. I just felt like the book was written for somebody other than me, and the reviews had me believing otherwise."
5,"Great story, couldn't put the book down","I have read so much about dieting, diets, what to do, what not to do, but the thing I always found missing was the motivational aspect.This book is well written, and the story is something I can relate to. Nothing extreme happened! Jami simply grew fatter, and then fixed it. I love this book!"
5,Very Real,This is one of the series in the intermediate years between communism and post-communism. The emotional conflicts of the characters and how they are expressed are very real. Excellent!
3,Good but what this Warning!,"They are great DVDs, I bought Rainforest Creeks, Clouds and Rain, there are a lot of great scenes and most of the scenes are good.When I bought nature scenes I was only planning to add sound tracks recorded by me (recitations), translation and then uploaded them to youtube not for a commerical use. just like this video [...] And to refer to Tony Helsloot as the producer of the videos.Even though, I can use the nature video streams which available online without buying them, but appreciating and supporting the hard work I decided to buy them and paid $57.85 however I am very very shocked when I read the warning in the DVD case I already paid so to use them legally.What the meaning of buying them, if I can not use them, I really feel aggrieved. I am seriously thinking of returning them, unfortunatly.I appreciate any resonable solution or recommendation DVDs that suite my case."
3,It's not the End of the world,"I would highly recommend It's Not the End of the World by Judy blume . This book would be good for children who have divorced parents .Where my parents have been together 30 happily years , so it was hard for me to get in the book because I did not know how she felt. This book about a14 year girl who spends 3 of her teenager years thinking that she will get her parents back together , so what happens ? So read on to find out !!!!!I would recommemd this book for divorced parents who have children to read."
3,It's not th end of the end fof the world,"I would highly recommend It's Not the End of the World by Judy blume .

This book about a14 year girl who spends 3 of her teenager years thinking that she will get her parents back together , so what happens ? So read on to find out !!!!!I would recommemd this book for divorced parents who have children to read."
1,Boooooooooooooring,It's Not the End of the WorldThis is a boring book. It's about a kid whose parents get divorced. Who wants to read about divorce? Yawn!
5,A wonderful book,"This is a really great book by a great author.I happened to have this book when my sister was telling me about the author, so I started to read it and I could not put it down. This is a good book because the author knows how to involve you in the story. I think every kid should read this book for fun. If your parents are divorced or are going through one, I definitely feel you should read this book."
3,Quick read,This book is very teenage oriented. Its a little older but its still entertaining. I would recommend it to teenage girls who like to read.
4,doesnt get old...,"i was looking for all of my old books and found that someone gave away ITS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD... well i re-bought it and re read it and i liked it alot. i remembered everything about the book as i read it, it can deffently be read more then once..."
4,Good accounting software for small business.,I find this software very useful to run my small business and it tracks and alerts me about payable and receivable invoices due. This is my first accounting software I have started using. I have not used other accounting softwares to make a comparitive review.
2,"10k Yellow Gold Round 4-Prong Solitaire Diamond Ring (1/6 ct, j-k color, I2-I3 Clarity) - Size 9 Review","I tried this ring on my wedding ring band finger and it would slip and slide around my finger, so I know that I must need an 8.5 size ring for my wedding ring band finger. I was disappointed that it didn't fit but I am getting another one that is a 3-Stone ring that is a size 8.5 and it represents more to me about my wedding day and process than just the one solitary stone."
3,Color and clarity varies considerably,"I wasn't totally sure of my ring size, so I bought two different sizes, just to be sure. Now I'm disappointed because one is fairly colorless but cloudy, and the other one is very clear but definitely yellower. For those who aren't familiar with diamond grading, know that these diamonds may not sparkle in the way you're hoping, and also might be yellow. This item is out of stock now, but if I could I would order 5 more, and see if I could luck out and get a nicer diamond : ) Anyway, I got this ring in a special sale for an unbelievable price, so at the end of the day I'm not complaining!"
3,Plot like molassus but characters make it all worth while!,"This film is a sort of ""day movie""; where the audience is taken into the life of a few men working at a normal job in normal lives. A slight criminal twist at the end simply adds to the flavor of the characters who are really the only reason to watch the movie. Each man and his personality is subtley revealed throughout the film and the nearly oscar winning performances by Al Paccino, Kevin Spacey and Jack Lemmon are stunning. Worth the experience and worth the down time."
3,Actor's Showcase,"""Glengarry"" is what's often referred to as an ""actor's showcase"", and that's not ncessarily a good thing. There are a great number of very strong individual performances in this film, but the problem is that there are very few good ensemble performances; every scene seems to be set up as an opportunity for one actor to deliver a monologue, whether it's Alec Baldwin's initial ""pep talk"", or Jack Lemmon delivering his standard pathetic character we've seen in countless movies like ""Save the Tiger"". In fact, the entire movie is full of excessivley mannered performances. Too often you find yourself saying something like ""Look! It's Alec Baldwin!"". None of the actors really disappear into their roles.It's also one of the most resolutely downcast and depressing movies you'll ever see; it begins on a low note, and heads South from there, as these pathetic men attempt to scrape out some sort of living in a corrupt business. Recommended for college film class students only."
1,"Boring, tired actors swearing alot","My past boss LOVED this movie and referenced it all the time. I was reminded of it when a friend saw it in NYC recently at the anniversary so I thought I'd rent it. I kept waiting for it to get funny and interesting. Thought it ended poorly. Boring, tired actors swearing alot. Great if you like to be reminded how lame salespeople act in the office."
5,The Perfect Movie,"This movie surely has all the elements of the perfect movie. Excellent actors engaged in excellent, believable acting; superb storyline; fantastic sets and mood; and a well-crafted and laid out plot. Glengarry Glen Ross has many of my favorite actors in it: Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, et al. With this cast, it was almost sure to succeed. But, we've seen films with superb casts that have gone nowhere. Well, Glengarry Glen Ross goes somewhere; it goes straight into one's memory bank as a great film worth watching over and over again. I haven't bought it yet, but definitely intend to. Enjoy this excellent film"
2,Streaming playback is bad. Sound and picture don't sync!,Great movie. The reason for the 2 star review was that the streaming playback on Amazon was so poor that the voices and action never synced up. We paid more attention to that after a while than the actual movie. Bummer...Do yourself a favor and buy a hard copy of this great movie or stream it on a less buggy platform.
1,Bad movie. Period.,I rented this movie based on the Amazon recommendation because I liked the movie Boiler Room. I thought this movie would be good because it dealt with real estate. The whole movie revolves around struggling real estate investment salesman who work for a company that sells the real estate investments. About 80% of the movie takes place in the company office and they talk back and forth about how to sell to customers and making commissions. I would much rather watch Wall Street and Boiler Room than this boring movie...avoid. I wrote this review while the movie was streaming (via Amazon Video on Demand) because I was extremely bored and disappointed by this movie.
1,What The.......!???,"Quick synopsis: These 4 or 5 guys sit around their real estate office for 2 hours talking about not getting good leads....PERIOD.This is SO boriing! I made it through 30 minutes and then I fell asleep. After I woke up I fast forwarded through to get to the GOOD PART, but there is no good part!!!!!!!!!!!!Who wrote the 'good reviews' for this waste of film? Amazon, are you hiring people to do this? Say it isn't so."
1,ABC - awfully boring crapola,"I heard people refer to this movie when they were enthusiastically trying to illustrate a point about sales or something along those lines. I rented it and was severely disappointed. I have an MBA in finance and a PhD in psychology, so it's not a matter of a lack of qualifications to appreciate a fine film. With the exception of a few lines here and there, the movie is just plain boring."
1,two wasted hours and [$$$] bucks down the drain,"A complete waste of time - the point (if any) is made in 10 minutes and then rehashed over and over and over. So real estate sales people are lying cheating scum bags, which is nothing to make a whole movie about. Will the sequel be two hours of used car slalesmen swearing and lying to customers and each other?"
1,Horrible...,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. When you see Pacino, Harris, Spacey, Lemmon, Baldwin all in one movie, you have to think it would be a great movie. It was absolutely pathetic. What I cannot figure out is how this movie is even still in print, and yet A Bronx Tale is out of print!DO NOT BUY"
2,Great? Wait a second...,"My friend and I read many reviews of this movie- rave reviews. We are wondering if we missed something, because it is honestly one of the least interesting movies each of us has seen. Riveting?... Possibly in its ability to lull one to sleep. Even as fans of the movie's actors, we were left extremely unsatiated. If you are older, possibly this is for you. If you are looking for action, this would be your last choice."
5,Like angels descended from heaven...,"This movie is essentially a documentary about real estate agents and how similar they are to angels directly descended from heaven. We see these selfless cherubs offer their precious time to help us lesser folk buy investments in land, offering their assistance every step of the way. These virtuous spirits of real estate work for Wise Old Williamson, a kind godly like figure who generously gives them ""leads"" (a list of people that need help to buy property). However dramas arise when these leads are stolen and the angels become very upset as they no longer know who to help. After seeing this movie, I am convinced that any one working in the Real Estate industry should be Sainted. How else would we know what property we have to buy!"
2,Glengarry review,"I am a huge Al Pacino fan, but honestly, this film bored me.I did not enjoy any aspect of it and would not recommend itto anyone. I am surprised so many others enjoyed it.This is the only Al Pacino film I did not enjoy."
2,good acting but,good acting and kind of engaging but 2 hours of listening to people's pain - guys who are lying - who hate their job - is not my idea of entertainment.
5,No chases...just exceptional acting from an all-star cast,"If you're looking for a smart, sharp dialogue-filled extravaganza, look no further. This film is brilliant, it's just that simple. Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, and Alan Arkin, with that cast, how can you go wrong? The majority of this film takes place in and around a real-estate office. Yet the script and dialogue are so spectacular, that you really won't notice. Without giving the film away, it just shows the depths that some will stoop, to save their job, and the depths that companies will stoop to motivate their employees. One caution, this film has extremely harsh language. If you're easily offended by 'foul' language, you might need to pass. There is 'foul' language a plenty in this film, but if you can get through it, you'll really witness something special in film."
5,All salespeople must watch this!,"If you want to know anything about ANYTHING, this movie will tell you... it will show you how to stand up and always close a deal... whether it is selling something, or meeting a new person.Once you are done watching this movie, repeat the acronyms ABC and AIDA, and their meanings, to yourself every morning..."
5,"""Will you go to lunch!""","Possibly one of the finest ensemble films ever made! Acting teachers should show this movie scene by scene, it is that brilliant. Mamet's sticatto dialogue is mesmerizing. Al Pacino is alternately smooth, with his slick, salesman's pitch, and menacing with his biting, angry verbal attacks. Jack Lemmon, the master of subtly, is wonderful. But, Kevin Spacey, steals the scenes with his quiet, pensive and, ultimately, cunning performance. (And you can download the wavs @ his website to amuse your co-workers!) You'll watch it over and over! Enjoy!"
4,ACTING AT THE GREATEST LEVEL,"This is acting at its best, and does not get much better than this ! PAcino, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and even Baldwin in his brie appearance are outstanding here, extracting the best from the actors in a situation that makes you feel sorry for being a salesman !!!!"
4,Superb Dialogue Top-notch cast led by Jack Lemmon,"Jack Lemmon is superb in this intrinsic movie about the harsh realities of the real estate game. I you love intense drama or enjoy fast paced talk , while peering into the psychology of real salesmen , this is for you . Goodfellas , Wall Street kind of intensity . Buy it on DVD and call your girlfriend , tell her she's staying the night , you will never look at salesmen the same way again . It is harsh , but undeniably attractive , Pacino is also magnificent as Roma the suave hustler ."
5,One of the top 100 flicks of all time,"This is one of the best movies ever made. James foley is a brilliant director, and the ensemble cast is amazingly good, especially Jack Lemmon and Kevin Spacey. If you like great cinema, you can't miss this film."
5,"Great Cast, Great Story and a Great Movie!","It's refreshing to see a film, where the script alone is enough to give it five stars, since Reservoir Dogs. In addition to which, the first rate performances of Pacino, Harris, Lemmon and Spacey were matched by Alec Baldwin's shocking histrionics. Intense and above all entertaining!"
5,Always Be Closing!,"Most people think of explosions, car chases and action/adventure films as guy movies. Well, maybe, but those are for boys. There's no car chase in this movie, no deaths and no guns. But it manages to hold your attention while telling its story of real estate salesmen. This is the quintessential guy movie. This screen adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer-winning play is incredibly stagebound, which was a stroke of genius: thus, the fast-paced dialogue and the desperate, macho facades of the characters become, and stay, the focus. This allows the amazing talents of the cast to flourish. Pacino and Lemmon are untouchable. Ed Harris is outstanding. Having just the four main characters makes the whole thing seem oddly forced at times. Baldwin's slick delivery of his ball-busting speech to the three underachieving salesmen, is a scene to remember. Highly recommended."
2,Dissapointing...,"After reading reviews and seeing the impressive casting I had a certain amount of expectation... sadly few were fulfilled. Interesting characters and a simple plot, well acted... should be in the bag, just don't know where it went wrong... No wonder I had never heard of it. If you want to watch a better depiction of a pressurised, sales environment try Boiler Room, Swimming with Sharks or Wall Street."
2,Overrated,"I am giving this film 2 starts for the acting, which is good.The movie itself was a huge disappointment. It's obvious that the film is based on a play; the way the actors interrupt eachother and repeat certain phrases makes you feel like you're watching a theatre performance. I didn't care for a single character in the film, every line is screamed, every third word is a curse. I felt exhausted half way through and my mind began to wander. Real estate is just not that exciting and if you find it too stressful, get another job."
2,It did not convince me....,"Unlike most of the reviewers here and on IMDB, I didn't like it. To me, the acting seemed contrived. I have been in places that operated like this (luckily I was a consultant, not actually working for the company) and I have seen what the actors here attempted to portray firsthand. I think they did their best but it did not 'feel' like the real thing to me. Baldwin's famous speech seemed so scripted to me, the words are right, but the way it was delivered seemed too fake."
3,"Not bad, but very overated","Don't get me wrong- there are some things about this movie that I love (Baldwin and Lemmon's performances), but a few things become readily apparent when watching this film: 1.) Real Estate looks like a hard job. 2.) Everyone has a small vocabulary. 3.) Agents will swindle you without blinking. 4.) Arkin and Pacino together- they make the film twice as long as it should be. WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH REPEATING EVERYTHING? Both of their entire dialogue consists of an exact statement or switched around version of what someone else just said to them. It's very annoying."
5,Classic Sales Movie,This is one of few great Sales movies. This movie ranks right up there with Wall Street and more recent Boiler Room. This movie employs an entourage of big name actors. This is a must see for any person in the Sales Industry.
5,"For anybody who knows every line to ""Reservoir Dogs""-",this movie is for you. For those people who can appreciate great dialogue and need a crash course in the world of high pressure selling - rent this movie and you will not be disappointed. The Alec Baldwin scene alone makes this movie an instant classic
1,Get Real!,"Sorry to be out of step here, but this movie is simply awful! Awful because, the ""real thing,"" the allegory for the Reagan Administration, the ""evils of the free enterprise system,"" wasn't real at all. There is no sales office on the planet where this type of ""lead chaos,"" language, mutinous and insubordinate talk, et al goes on - despite those who would like to ascribe the worst to business and business people. Baldwin's character is total BS; contests NEVER are Cadillac, then steak knives, then you're fired. Spacey's character is preposterous as it gets for a sales manager. The ""second thoughts"" buyer is a well-heeled idiot, and how many of those do you know? Using the ""F Word"" 500 times in a film does not make the dialog ""gritty and real."" Yes, some of the performances were top notch, and yes, there ARE a great many abuses in business, we see that every day, unfortunately; but this is just nonsense on a big screen."
2,Depressing - not for the feint of heart,I watched this movie some time ago and would not watch it again. Unless you enjoy watching middle aged men ruin their careers and sink into depression I would skip this one despite the top names.
1,Hated it!,"This is a movie that stands out in my mind as one of the worst I have ever seen. It is so depressing, and unsavory. I'm sure the actors played their parts wonderfully, because I hated all of the characters by the end of this film. I guess I can't stand all of the slick SOBs that close deals! I can't believe I watched the entire thing, I was waiting for it to get better."
3,Glengarry Glen Ross,"I first heard about this movie from a co-worker who compared the movie to ""Office Space"" for the sales world. I was expecting a hillarious comedy. When I watched it, I kept waiting for it to get funny, but it was more of a drama. The all-star cast was great though. Upon reflection, I could see points made that are good lessons learned in business -- points that I could make at work. When I talked with some of our sales people about it, they had really enjoyed this movie. So maybe it has a very special audience. Just don't expect a comedy. . . it's a drama with a few funny moments."
3,Cost-Benefit,"Selected scenes of the movie is good for managers and small business owners to show to their sub-ordinates. This special edition has documentary on salesmen psychology, which adds to the value of the price."
3,"Wife hated it, I thought it was good","If you've never worked in sales or part of a selling organization, you're likely to be bored... such as my wife. I thought it was a good story of the struggle of salespeople who are expected to perform impossible feats with poor tools that leads to desperation."
5,"Great movie, great performances, great cast","This is one great movie. It takes place in an office building, a Chinese food restaurant, a diner, a car, and outside in the rain. It is brilliantly written and has a large amount of suspense and tension that really catches the viewer and holds him in its clutches. It shows the costs of depravity and the greed lust for success in a tough business.The cast is fantastic with Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, and screen legend Jack Lemmon. They make this movie what it is and what it is is fabulous."
3,"Very good movie, dissapointing DVD","Let me say that this is a really solid movie with great performances. I'd give the film itself 4 stars, but docked one for the purposes of this review due to a rather lackluster roster of extras.Two disc set? Come on, some of this stuff is just boring. The all-new ""documentary"", ABC, is not even about the movie! It's just a bunch of salesman rambling on about their jobs. The commentary from James Foley wasn't worth my time, too dry. But the actor's commentaries are really entertaining and enjoyable. But the Jack Lemmon tribute is a fairly embarrassing piece, one that I will never watch again. That's how I feel about the entire second disc, it'll never come out of the case again.But the movie will, and when all is said and done, that's what matters."
3,Like Alistair MacLean -- only nastier!,"Expertly researched and written maritime thriller in the solid tradition of Alistair MacLean and Hammond Innes. Terrific atmosphere aboard a tug that salvages wrecked ships -- and with much knowledge to impart about the little-known salvage business. Strong plotting, lots of gritty action, including a nuclear device -- but a bit too much death and bloodshed for my tastes. Callison seems to enjoy bumping off major characters, often in a somewhat grisly way, and this happened a few too many times to conform to the traditional thriller plot (a al Innes) where the bad guys ""get theirs"" and the good guys win. Not a bad, book, though, for those who've run out of MacLean novels to read."
5,Berlitz Romanian: Phrase Book & Dictionary,I got the book within several days and it was in excellent condition. I was very happy with it and used it a lot while in Romania. Romanian nationals were even impressed with the book!
3,Absolete,This book isn't bad. It is useful if you stick with it but there are so many other resources out there. You can get better study guides from free websites.
2,travel time to get to destination,this movie took way to long i cant remember what company on amazon i ordered it from but make sure you ask them how long it would take for the price your paying
3,"This re-release is in fullscreen, 1.33:1 & devoid of extras...","...but the bargain price was right up my alley to see these later Hellraiser films for the 1st time. I only owned the 1st 3 on DVD and saw Hellraiser IV: Bloodline back in the 90's, a title I was initially disappointed with back then but have more appreciation for now despite being not as good as the classic earlier films.The fullscreen presentation right off the bat cuts off the beginning credits as all the names of the stars & crew get cut off at the sides, such as star of the film ""Kari Wu""! She's not even Asian. The sound quality is a bit lacking also as some dialogue is hard to understand versus the music, and there are NO subtitles or closed captioning. No anything on the menu screen except ""Play"" and ""Scene selection"".The previous release of Deader on DVD according to Amazon's page is 1.85:1 widescreen, but I don't own that disc but those out there may want that version if bothered by the boxiness of this newer disc."
2,Yet another direct to dvd sequel,"The Hellraiser series continues to be an excersise in pointless filmmaking. This new film is a badly thought out mess that uses plot points from the original film, but has no actual point. It's a cliche filled mess that might be enetertaining if you're drunk enough. Bad as it is though it's better than the previous four or five sequels"
2,GETTING COLLECTTION,AGAIN JUST ADD TO COLLECTION.. NOT A GOOD PLOT....IM NOT SURE IF CLIVE BARKER DIRECTED THIS OR NOT. BUT IT JUST CANT CUT THE MUSTARD FOR ME.
2,Disappointed,"Being the mother of an autistic daughter, I have read a few books on the subject. This book was much too clinical to the parent who basically wants to know what is happening to their child. I have read other books which talk on this subject in language which is easier to understand."
4,Standard Issue,Not much to say. These plugs look good and function well. Overall quality is good. I attached mine with the screw-in connectors which worked well. Price is great.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The 60's are gone, long gone..... We have all moved on, hopefully... Apparently some of us have not.... I was sorry to have wasted all that time reading what turned out to be a very typical, and not particularly entertaining, story of teenage angst."
3,"not what i expected, but interesting","I am intrigued by old hospitals and institutions and bought this book based on the author's stay in such a place. About two-thirds through the book, the location shifted to life on the outside. Now yes, this is all in all a good thing for our character, but up my alley. I understand why, but much of the sexual content was a little too graphic for me."
4,An excellent book for sciatica sufferers,"I found this book to be an excellent educational tool for someone new to low back pain and sciatica. The authors do a good job of explaining the pysiology of the problem, something many doctors fail to do. Subtle causes of pain are dealt with quite well, which to me suggests that the authors know their stuff. I thought it was written with the knowledge of a skilled doctor, but from the point of view of an inquisitive patient."
5,Very well put together album,"this album is very powerful yet slows down at the right time. And for those that are patient, 17 minutes after kill the music industry goes off, gone away plays."
2,Recluse yourself from this CD,"Why is it that bands continue to pump out CD's long before they have enough sustaining content for a truly memorable disk. While Remedy and Stupid Girl almost make this Cd worth the price, the rest of the songs are far from memorable. I kept hoping that something great would grab me after Stupid Girl, but after many fast forwards, I realized that I had bought another one hit wonder band cd."
4,Superior male vocals and catchy guitar licks!!,"The thing I love most about this disc is Scooter Ward's vocals. He has such a consistent, yet rugged tone. Eventhough I didn't care for all of the songs I never got tired of his voice. Another great aspect of this disc is the minory guitar licks whining in the background. The nicely contrast the underlying melodies that are more natural in chord structures.The first half of album is very pleasing. I especially like: Stupid Girl, Don't Belong, Remedy and Wasted Years. The final half was just OK. I was getting a bit lost in trying to find a theme in the second half and the material was weaker than the first half.All in all, four stars. A bonus DVD is always nice, but as with anything free, don't expect it blow your socks off. The images and concept are cool, but it missing something...not sure what, but it is."
4,Awesome Album,"This Album is for everyone who loves rock music. one of my favorite songs on this album is ""stupid girl"".Also, the limited edition DVD is really cool."
2,So very disappointing.,"I really love Cold. I thought their first two albums were excellent, and I've been looking forward to this for a long time, but I really can't begin to describe how let down I was upon receiving this. More than once, I thought I'd bought the new Staind album by mistake. It sounds like they're actually trying to sound like Staind on practically every song. Since I'm not a fan of Staind, and have always thought that Cold had a much more interesting sound, that is not a good thing.And one more thing: Where is ""Gone Away""? They release this amazing song, put it on a freakin' WWF album, and then don't even put it on the new album, even though it's a fantastic song? I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on this band at the moment, but I think my respect for them has significantly dropped.Oh, and ""Stupid Girl"" is just awful. I think I'm going to go listen to ""13 Ways to Bleed Onstage"", to try to erase this atrocity from my memory."
4,Well Written,"I really dont have much to say except i suggest getting in your car, start driving around and blasting the opener to this cd ""Remede"". i really could not stop listening to it, its adictive. i know that there are many nay-sayers for this band, as there are to any band but i would suggest, even if you dont like the band in general/their actions outside of music or the people in the band, keep an open mind and i can almost guarentee that you will like it if you are into this kind of music. its not a bad price for a great cd. other recomendations are the obvious suffocate and stupid girl but also i would suggest listening to the more melodic ""wasted years"". very good cd over all so i give it 4 out of five stars."
4,Kinda soft for Cold but still awesome,"This is Cold's third album, and they seem to soften up with each one. But these guys make great music no matter how they sound. The best song on this cd is ''Stupid Girl.'' My other favorites are ''Remedy'', ''Suffocate''', '' Wasted Years'', and ''Kill the Music Industry.'' The recording quality of this album is better than the previous two releases and it is WAY easier to understand what Scooter is saying. There is almost no screaming in this album, so super hard rockers probably won't enjoy it that much. It is good pure rock but it can get annoying at some parts. That's the only reason i didn't give this album a 5 star rating. However it is easy to listen to if you are in the right mood. There is some explicit language in this cd but there is an edited version for those of you that do not like cussing. Overall this is a fantastic album and a must-have for any Cold fan or any fans of good rock."
3,LOVED IT THE FIRST DAY...,"The first day I bought this, I had, obviously, never heard it before; only small clips of it. After I had become familiar with it, I started noticing BIG imperfections in this CD, such as the singer's aparant inability to annunciate and the guitars' lack of strength. The instrumentation isn't near as complex as it is emotional and therefore can only be listened to successfully about once every six months. I think this is a shame, because aside from this, I don't know what else to fill my CD collection with."
5,Read this,"Great CD. In all honesty, probably the best CD ever made. Of course, this kind of laid back, melodic rock (I think they refer to it as recession rock) is my favorite genre of music. I play the guitar, and although simple, their acoustic and electric riff ideas are beautiful and ingenious. Every song on this CD is exeptional. The best song being 'Gone Away' which is actually the secret track so you have to wait 13 minutes until the CD is over to hear it! But seriously, if you're thinking of buying this CD, do it. Now. You definetly won't regret it."
5,Simply AMAZING!,"COLD is a wonderful band who displays there vocals with lead singer scooter and the backups by the guatarists, this band touches all floors when it comes to self emotions reguvination and just the overall basis of rocking it hard and not giving a shi* with the record lable FLIP still around it could be a jump start to a new revolution of hard rock with feeling which really brings back why we are here in this world, with the whole CD and songs there is no reason not to by this cd this is not a 1 hit wonder CD its the best ive heard in awhile from anyband and they deserve all the credit in the worldand for getting this far i do not see a end to COLD..."
5,"Cold's latest and greatest, Year of the Spider.","Cold's third release, Year of the Spider is definetly an improvement over there first two albums. Scooter's lyrics are deep and meaningful backed up behind the rest of the group's instrumental work. There first single off the album ""Stupid Girl"" might be different from there older songs as is the majority of the rest of the album, but surely is by far the best music the band has written. From beginning to end the album sends chills up your spine. If your a fan of there previous albums then definetly pick this one up, if you arent then give it a try anyway. This album has a different vibe and serves up something for everyone."
2,Cold feet,"Was a fan of '13 ways to bleed on stage'. This album is another main stream tragedy. Poppy enough to fit right in at a U2 concert. Dark and heartfelt you say? Yeah, if your 14 and grounded."
1,not what I expected,"I downloaded the songs from Cold's second album - 13 Ways to Bleed Onstage - when it was still legal and I absolutely loved it. I still consider it one of my favorite albums. So of course when Year of the Spider was released I was anxious to get it. Unfortunately what I found I did not like. It's been said before in these reviews and I'll say it again...this is mainstream rock meant to bring in dollars from mass appeal. The transformation from the debut album (Cold) - which isn't anything to right home about - to this one is astounding. The production on ""13 Ways"" blows ""Year of the..."" away. So, I would recommend you listen to this first before purchasing. And if you are looking for something with more of an edge, than definitely look into their second album (13 Ways to Bleed Onstage). I would avoid the first album as well."
1,typical radio rock,"This album sounds exactly like all the other rocks songs that you hear when you turn on your local rock radio station. If you like that kind of thing, then this is the music for you.Me? I yearn for something original.What makes this band stand out in comparison to all the other popular radio rock bands out there right now? You tell me... because I don't see it."
4,Weak,"Now i love cold, i really do, but this cd really dissapointed me. Year of the spider sounds so... mainstream. while cold in the past had it's fair share of slow songs and wasn't really hard, it just wasnt so whiney as this. There are some good songs on here though, like remedy, sufficate, and don't belong. buy thier self titled album or 13 ways to bleed befor this.3.5 stars overall"
4,Cold almost reaches peak again,"THis cold cd was probably the most anticipated cd i wanted to buy in a long time. there last 13 way to bleed was the album ever since pantera's Far Beyond Driven. Anyways at first i was torn. I was let down becasue it was not an instant classic. After listining to it a few times it had 5 stellar songs and the rest were just either radio friendly or fillir crap. It was more polished and comercialized unlike there previous 2 which were raw, harder, darker, and edger. DOnt get me wrong this cd is good, but not a must have. To me this cd was more for the younger masses. the best songs are Cure My Tragedy, Wasted Years, Remedy, dont belong, and like the rockin KIll the music industry. It is short but faster paced. I really loved this band it seemed when there were not so famous that they were better. Scooter is still amaazing."
2,"Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, Bush","If you like the bands listed above in that order then you will like this album. For me, I can't listen to an album like this too long before getting bored. Many of the songs sound the same, especially the vocals. The vocals are good, but too much of the same sound gets me about three songs into the album before I'm looking for another CD. 13 Ways is a better album. It has more variety."
1,What a shame...a not a good album at all.,"To sum it up, Cold started theier album career with a very good debut album that seemed to garner the band a bit of street cred as a band who were dangerous and dark, dude.They could have even been quoted in the same sentance as a band like TooL, they were that good.But this album is just what Nickleback and Creed fans have been waiting for, slow mid tempo riffs, detuned guitars, boring meaningless lyrics, basically everything that you've heard before, and perfect for the mindless mass American market.Which is a shame coz they could have been a good modern heavy metal band, but i guess they still have to pay off there label advance, and had to give thier sound mass appeal.If you dont have taste in good rock, you will love this, if you are a puritan and hard rock obbsessive, you wont even care."
4,"Different, but better than I expected it to be","I've never listened to Cold before, and probably the only reason that I even heard about them was because 'Stupid Girl' was played so much on the radio. That was what drew me to the CD, that song. It was jagged but had a real vocals and a good tune, it was absent of the screaming that I almost expected it would have. The rest of the songs on CD were even better than Stupid Girl. The angst was gone from the songs, replaced with something more emotionally felt. It isn't perfect, but then again, what is?"
2,"Terrible, mundane, psuedo-hard rock","While the first single Stupid Girl caught my attention, the rest of this album made me sorry to have wasted my money on it. My previous experience with Cold had been the song Bleed (with Aaron Lewis, horray for cookie cutter hard rock...) which I liked, so I hoped for more from this cd.This album offers nothing new or imaginative. Lyrically its stereotypical i-feel-sorry-for-myself-and-want-everyone-else-to rock (Staind fans will like this one), and musically its the same formula repeated 13 times. I had a hard time finishing any of these songs, being sufficiently bored by the second verse most times.Stay away from this one. If you really want some angry music, listen to some Metallica or something with some creativity included."
1,"I'm A Cold Fan, But....","I wanted to like this record, I really did. But to be honest, it's one of the more over-hyped, disappointing releases outside the realm of Metallica. Now we've all heard the heavy sing along chorus of ""Stupid Girl"" and it's a great song. Too bad the rest of the album has no such other redeeming moments. I'm not one of these guys who hates bands that try something different. Hell, I even consider myself a big time Cold fan. ""13 Ways"" was a killer record with lots of different material on it. The bleakness is still here, on songs like ""Cure My Tragedy"" and ""Suffocate."" But the spark of there previous work is noticeably absent. Other songs, like the tribute number ""The Day Seattle Died"" and the laughable ""Kill the Music Industry"" seem very ponderous and almost pretentious. Too bad, Cold has a ton of talent, but here they're just going through the motions."
3,A overrated dissapointment.,"While many people are giving this album a perfect 5 and claiming it to be the best Cold album yet,I have to strongly dissagree with those reviews.This album is overrated,and is very dissapointing.'13 Ways to Bleed on Stage' is one of the greatest albums of all time,and I expected this to be at least a 4.But no.'The Year of the Spider' is just a adverage album and nothing special at all.The DVD that came with this wasen't that bad though,and the it also came with a cool temperary tatoo of the Cold spider logo.But the album itself?Eh...What a dissapointment."
1,Is this Cold?,"I have been a big supporter of Cold, love 13 Ways to Bleed Onstage. I rushed out to buy this and to say I am depressed could be a good thing considering I am listening to Cold, but my depression comes from knowing I spent money on a manufactured pop cd. Three or four good songs that are sure to be sinlges, ""Stupid Girl"", ""Remedy"" are the obvious two. The rest is the same song with slight changes. I rated their last album a 5 year before last when I bought it, so I am not somebody that doesn't like these guys. I just think they rushed this album. Not for sure what has happened to Scooter's voice either. They have been together for 15 years so hopefully by the time the next album comes out they can muster something better then this. Buy the self-titled and 13 Ways to Bleed Onstage way before even considering buying this."
2,Reeks of Fred Durst,"I really liked this group, when they were Stained, the CD sounds EXACTLY like Staind's. So, if you really like Stained and cannot wait two more weeks for their new CD, get this one. It's not a bad sound at all, but it's been done hense the two star raiting. These guys look really [good] in their video, but it is all just a show, they are soft all over, I'll be the first to coin the phrase ""radio metal"" because they are hard, harder than Phil Collins, Sting, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, and the like, but they got nothing on Metallica, Megadeth, Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Godsmack and other rarely played metal music. In fact, when I first saw these guys, Godsmack is what I thought, a Godsmack knock off, but i found they were nowhere near that caliber. Apparently the band has been together for 15 years, as Limp Bizkit and Stained. Basically, if you like Stained, buy the CD, if not AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS."
5,My first cold album - certainly not the last,"I will defer to the more educated opinion of others as i listen to a variety of music (r&b,pop,classical,rock and its various forms). So i will not compare the band to their contemporaries or talk about their influences (dont know and dont care).But about the album - its really good. Although the lyrics in most songs are about turmoil, sadness, anger etc. the songs and music is quite good and very listenable. My favorites are Suffocate (i really like the background singer) and stupid girl. The one that i didnt like is ""kill the music industry"" - just too loud for my tastes.In conclusion this album is not just for afficianadoes but also for listeners who just like good music irrespective of the genre. Happy Listening."
2,Very Disapointing!,"I bought this CD with very high expectations but, they were all let down. Remedy, Stupid Girl and Kill the Music Industry are the only good songs on the album, all the rest are just ballads that all sound the same. I should have gotten the new Marilyn Manson album instead because this is horrible!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,"This product has to be, by far, the worst value for anyone's money, be it a free gift certificate or your own hard earned cash. Of the 15 disks I have tried to use of the 50 in the package, NOT A SINGLE ONE HAS WORKED! THEY ARE COMPLETE GARBAGE!"
4,Great book for Newbies,"Great book for those wanting to get into Napoleonic minis. Overview of the period, major combatants, armies and campaigns. Even a simple painting guide. Very good one stop book for those new to the hobby."
4,"Good, but not great","This video was good, however I think that Warren Miller has done better. All of Warren's videos are great, but of his films I have seen this was not one of my favorites. I recomend getting Freeriders, also by Warren Miller, which in my opinion is the best video he has made."
4,Another great film by the legendary ski film master.,"Music by the Counting Crows, Big Head Todd and Patty Griffin complement the epic skiing footage. Don't miss and feel free to rewind the huge double back flip by the snowboarder at the end of the film. It seems he has plenty of air to do a third. Did I say huge?"
3,yuck(at least for me),not a very good game. kids will be bored and the old i wanna another game speech will come. i dont hate it im just saying it could have more options and more play to it. im 10 so im outgrown from this game but when i play with my brother he dosnt seem entertained and he goes crying to mom and saying i want this or i want that so im stuck playing it.if you want a game that your child will sit and play then let me suggest fisher price dollhouse or fisher price pet shop. if you want the outdoors and outdoor animals then ACUALLY go there and see it instead buying it through a one-day-worth game.
1,Wrong One,"Although this is a quality book and I love Calvin and Hobbes, I ordered Library Binding and was sent a Paperback book in sub par condition. Bought from SPL Management, LLC."
5,Back from hiatus and back in the groove,"This book represents the first strips published by Bill Waterson after he returned from a long hiatus. Though it does not contain any sequence of strips as memorable as the classic ""Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Snow Goons,"" it is still another excellent collection of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons. Starting with this book, the collections got larger, with color for the Sunday strips. For that alone, its worth the price."
4,"Very funny, but sometimes monotonous",The best thing I like about Calvin & Hobbes is the dialogue between Calvin and his father. I rate this book just below Asterix (European comic book).
5,The best of them all,"Well, ""Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat"" is by far the most sadisitc of the series, and the best. It holds this honor for many reasons, probably the most obvious, though, is the 'traffic safety poster contest.' That strip was pure gold. Definitely read this, but read the others first (that way, you build up to this one).After this one,the best are probably ""Something Under The Bed Is Drooling,"" and ""Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons."""
5,Jackie Mason helps you learn to talk Jewish the Yiddish way,"I wanted to learn some common Yiddish sayings. So I bought Jackie Masons' book titled: ""How to Talk Jewish"". It is an enjoyable book complete with Yiddish sayings and a taste of Jewish life as only Jackie Mason can tell it."
2,How to Talk Jewish,Not as good as I had hoped. He explains a lot of Yiddish phrases that are not commonly used. The commonly used expressions were not defined as well as I could have defined them myself.
2,Not much else out there,"The book was minimally helpful in my review for the oral boards. I was dumbfounded that one of the cases involving Creutzfeld-Jakob didn't mention the 14-3-3 protein in the workup of this illness. I'd recommend you get this book used, or even better, borrow it."
2,Translation?,This will be short. The art was wonderful. Any of Sulamith Wulfing's art is good and is the only reason to keep this book. The Translation of the fairy tales left a lot to be desired.
1,Dangerous Poisonous Device,"Purchased New, First the positive: Very satisfying massage, The thump effect is unusual, but feels effective and gives pleasing massage.Now the horrible: Whether on low back, thighs, or calves, this unit is so heavy, and so poorly balanced that I could not keep it in position while using with my non-dominant hand. Result was multiple round to oval gouges in my skin (more than 18 in all) on low back, calf, thigh, and ankle. Sort of a cross between a gouge and a bruise, as there was no overt bleeding but rather sores developed everywhere the device 'thumped' me when off center which was often because it is heavy and has an extremely awkward center of gravity. Worst thing is that every sore became infected. Lesions were painful very discolored, and didn't heal on their own. Healing was slow even with daily applications of antibiotic ointment. After more than a month sores are still discolored and healing slowly. Clearly, I cannot recommend thid device."
5,Great Percussive Massager!! Worked Wonders!,"The Thumper Mini-Pro 2's shape fit my body just perfectly. With 3 speeds to choose from there was always one that was just what I needed. The higher settings worked great on my tighter, more knotty spots. I'm recommending this to all my friends, no matter what their problems! There's sure to be some way the Thumper can help!"
4,VersaPro Thumper Mini Pro 2 Massager,"We are very happy with this product. Good price and value. Although a little heavy for me, its not a great deal, it does well as expected. I would recommend this to anybody."
2,Original vs New,The new Thumper Mini Pro 2 Personal Massager isn't as good as the original. The new one overheats and shuts down to quickly(30min) The original one went for an hour with no problem. It isn't as strong as the original.
5,"BETTER THAN A WIFE.,AND YOU DONT LOOSE YOUR HOUSE.","THIS IS THE ULTIMATE AUTO MASSAGE TOOL.,IT HAS WEIGHT AND STRONG MECHANICAL ACTION.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR MUSCLE WORK."
3,Not as durable as they used to be,"My first one lasted 11 years. Excellent value for about $200.The second one starts to make a sound like bearings rattling after about 12-15 minutes of use. It's about 13 months old.Works well for a short time, not a good value for the money anymore.Emailing the company hooked me up with a woman who explained that all changes they make in the product are for the better. Uh huh.Asking her for contact info for the head of the company, she sent me to the Director of Business Development. I didn't bother. Time to look for something else."
3,Not enough thump,"I bought this massager mainly for my back, and found it insufficient to massage deeper muscles. In that, you cannot push the massager against your body very hard without the massager freezing up (and quickly overheating). I would recommend it for small, surface muscles, however."
3,"ok unit, but too tempermental","this is our second hand-held unit. it performs ok, but must be held at a 90 degree angle to be most effective. also, you must unplug the unit when not in use. it tends to overheat easily. not very convenient for a unit at this price point."
2,We need stronger percussion...,"We use percussion massagers on the soles of the feet, the back, and the legs; and found this one to be not as strong as we like. We will be returning this as it does not do enough of what we want for the money we paid. We will keep looking for something that does a more vigorous job. If we had paid half of what we did. we could keep it, but we will put this money towards one that we like better."
3,Good massager unsound design,"I bought my mini pro massager several years ago and first it stopped operating properly, it did not produce the percussive vibrations as it should have. So I contacted the manufacturer, it was still under warranty and I was sent a new/reconditioned one. That was in 2005, now the power cord going into the handle, has split open. I am so upset and disappointed, this should not happen for this price, I take great care in handling it and the power cord should be more robust. I have had other electronic appliance for twenty years and the power cord has never split. It is a great massager but sadly is not well made."
1,Save your money,"The product itself works fine, but the day after I received it, I was in Wal-Mart and saw a Home-Medics version of the SAME THING for $29.95 and decided to buy it to compare. I did not feel any difference between the 29.95 Walmart version and this $189 version. The Walmart thumper had more settings, AND heat option (if you like that). When I contacted Pro Therapy Supplies to return this unit - because you have to contact them to get a return authorization number(sigh) - they informed me that there would be a 10% restocking fee. So I figure I'm out about $30-$35 total just for ordering this product even though I didn't keep it. Take my advice, go to Wal-Mart and order the Home Medics percussion massager and save yourself a ton of money."
3,cheap construction,"i've had the thumper 2 for a few weeks. it works fine, but the build quality is poor. my unit has a loose piece of plastic rattling around inside. i'd send it back but it's hard to find time to get to the post office. the exterior of the unit also appears cheap. given the price of the unit, i expected more.i think there's an opening at this price point for a manufacturer to produce a decent quality massager."
1,"Lame, and not original.....",Never seen the band live but this CD is a big disappointment.The sound is a low budget version of Santana / Los Lonely Boys.The songs are lame and way too commercial. Hope their next album turns out to be better (a lot).
4,You Know How to Whistle Don't You?,"Excellent Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall vehicle. Bogart plays a Key West fishing boat captain, and Bacall a 22 year old woman that wishes she hadn't ran from home. They both wind up in German friendly Martinique. It starts with Bogart taking a man deep sea fishing for Marlin. Bogart meets Bacall at the Hotel and the magic begins. When Bogart is approached by free French supporters trying to avoid the Vischy French, things get hot. Directed by Howard Hawks masterfully, it is again another great movie for fans of movies like ""Casablanca"" and ""Key West"". Well worth adding to your library. The picture and sound quality are excellent and it includes several extras."
2,Poor quality DVD - The Big Sleep,"The Big Sleep is one of my favorite films so I was very disappointed to discover that the DVD is a very poor quality transfer. The film has numerous scenes that are fogged, especially on the right side of the screen. Warner Bros. should restore this classic film."
5,a treasure chest of memories collection,"enough here to keep my memories alive, these are four of my favorite movies saves a lot of time not having to search for all four."
3,Fine entertainment with all concerned in their prime.,"3 1/2 stars actually. The film is fine entertainment with Bogie,Bacall and Howard Hawks in top form. In 1950 Warners came out with another version called The Breaking Point which starred John Garfield and was faithful to the Hemingway novel. It was equally good."
5,Bogart and Bacall,"It doesn't get any better then this,except maybe (Casablanca.) Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall really turn it on in this one."
5,Bogie and Bacall,This is a wonderful movie! I love Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall together and this movie doesn't disappoint. I absolutely love this!
4,Bogey Fan for many years GOOD AS EVER,"Along with Humphrey & Lauren I thought Walter Brennen was pretty good, Hoagy with his Music goes along way to also help out. I own this Movie an like it very much"
3,"Oh, Come off it, Lauren!","While ""To Have and Have Not"" helped make Bacall a star, her slinking around and awful singing voice seem old-fashioned and laughable today. Good story, though."
4,It Will Not Remind You of The Hemingway Novel,The movie is only vaguely reminiscent of the Hemingway story which was written in 1937 after the author finished his assignment as foreign correspondent covering the Spanish Civil War. The film takes place in Martinique following the beginning of World War II and it involves fighting between supporters of the new Vichy government and Free French partisans of Charles de Gaulle.The motion picture actually resembles CASABLANCA but it manages to be memorable in its own right mostly because of superb performances by Bogart and Bacall. Dan Seymour also does a magnificent job of playing the thoroughly obnoxious Captain Renard. Walter Brennan is a fairly good character actor but he is not very convincing in his portrayal of the alcoholic Eddy.
5,Bacalls first time,"Bogart and Bacal's sexual tension in this remake of Casablanca is so thick you can cut it with a knife. They had almost instant chemistry off screen and from the ""you know how to whistle"" scene on Bacal gets better. Even picking up comic business for the scene where Bogart is digging a bullet out of the French Resistence ""leader"". Walter Brenan also gives a good supporting prefomance as a drunk sidekick. Of course Bogart does not phone it in; he never does. In some ways the film is better than Casablanca because of the Bogart/Bacal relationship. And if you care about acting in films, this one lets you watch Bacal go from model to actress. One problem, they insisted on having Bacal sing. But the Hoggie Carmical at the piano is a treat beyond that song.But Bacal sings in the Big Sleep too with more success. If your a Hemingway fan, you will find that the screen writers used little beyond the title of his book."
5,Bogart and Bacall-The Signature Collection,"I LOVE Bogart and to see him act with the love of his life was a real treat. Two of these films-To Have and Have Not and Key Largo-should be in every Bogart fans' DVD collection. Unfortunately, The Big Sleep and Dark Passage do not measure up to the first two I mentioned, but are still interesting enough to take a look at."
1,Don't buy this from Amazon!,I waited to order this until after the official release becuase I had heard that amazon was shipping the dvds in the snap cases that don't even fit the box they come in(they hang out to far and are not tight enough to sit in the box snugly without falling out). It didn't really matter because I ended up getting what I didn't want in the first place. I would advise against buying this from amazon. Go to Wal-Mart or Best Buy where they most likely have the the same items except with the nice cases for the same price. The movies however are great.
3,Look Further for Big Sleep,"Three of the four movies in this collection are among my very favorite movies with ""The Big Sleep"" being the front runner. I was so disappointed at the poor quality of that particular DVD's burn! In many key scenes the right side is so pale that it is distracting. Come on Bogie lovers, let's get Criterion on this one. We deserve better! (So does ""The Big Sleep""). That being said, it's great to have the Bogart/Bacall collection offered together."
4,maybe just whistle,"If only all movie couples had this much chemistry. The Big Sleep is an intricate film noir - so much so that it's easy to lose track of the plot if you blink during a piece of dialogue - while To Have And To Have Not is more Casablanca-esque complete with WWII setting and reluctant but always heroic Bogart.Key Largo and Dark Passage are the weaker of the four, but the former has some interesting characters and the latter picks up after they do away with the first-person camera."
5,To Buy or Buy Not (recommended),"Though the wartime setting attempts to recreate the mood of Casablanca (nightclub, resistance groups, efforts to flee Martinique), the story lacks the requisite impact. Viewers can't help but be forgiving because in Lauren Bacall's coming out party she's fresh, sultry, and well dressed. And Bogie quite capably holds everything together even with a less than spectacular script. Just watching Bogie and Bacall interact is worth the highest rating. The chemestry between the two does not appear to be scripted. A real romance was nurtured on the set. The DVD commentary offers interesting insight to how the mediocre film was salvaged so as not to wreck Bacall's budding career. All things considered, this is a classic worthy of purchase.Movie quote: ""You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow."""
1,Useless.,"Amazon keeps prompting me to review these socks that I bought over a year ago. I wore them once or twice and then I think I threw them away. I have no idea where they are now. These socks: a. run really large, b. do not stay put on your foot, c. do not wick moisture. Really useless socks."
1,Not the right kind!,I have purchased these before from the NB store itself. These are not the same!!! They were also huge...like men's socks. The material isn't nearly as nice as the ones I got from the NB store.
4,Excellent Reference for Practicing Engineers,"This is another in the valuable ""Concept Series"" of books by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers' Center for Chemical Process Safety. It's purpose is ""to assist designers and operators of chemical facilities to understand and reduce potential hazards associated with static electricity."" The book succeeds admirably in achieving this purpose for it's target audience. This work is particularly valuable as a supplement to the NFPA and API publications on the control of static electicty, providing a nicely balanced combination of theoretical background and practical example. The extensive References section is a very helpful guide to the literature. The book is well organized and very clearly written.Highly recommended for practicing engineers who want to improve their understanding of static ignition mechanisms and who need to apply the published standards to real world situations."
3,Mostly data,The majority of the book is tables. They are evaluating versions of the greek manuscripts which indirectly correlate to the different versions of the New Testament. I think James White's book is much better although it reaches different conclusions.
1,Screamer!,This kettle doesn't whistle; it's more like a loud wail!Also; it's impossible to pour a cup of coffee or tea without dripping alongside the cup!
2,do the original,this album was ok but my suggestion is to get Dr. Buzzard & the original Savannah Band if you want the best of this type of music - Kid Creole and the Coconuts was birthed from Dr. Buzzard so why not get the original
4,"Trying to be original, and mostly succeeding","Buchbinder makes a good show of the solo part, not really adding anything new but more than holding his own. He is not the most lyrical or heroic of pianists. Where this performance differs from others, as you'd expect, is Harnoncourt. He has ideas about Brahms that cana't be ignored. The strings play with no vibrato at times, the repeated accents in the Scherzo are clipped staccato bursts (I felt a little sea sick), and above all he inserts hairpin turns in sustained notes, a la Baroque and Rococco performance practice.You will find these quirks either interesting or irritating. They at least add an element of originality. Otehrwise, Harnoncourt chiefly feels that Brahms shouldn't be overblown--this is most evident in the modetly phrased slow movement. I liked that, and the sweet Concertgebouw accompaniment throughout, but I wouldn't say that conducting quirks make for greatness."
4,"A very good book, I highly recommend it.",Richard Cole has put together a very good overview on electrospray ionization. The book is a nice compilation of information concerning different aspects of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
4,Good Book,"If built, I doubt this gun would last 1000 rounds, due to the soft materials used, but at least that's 1000 rounds more than most others (too complicated to make) would."
4,just hard to find materials,"I found out the book satisfactory.Gun easy to built & require a lot of patience to complete project. Buy the book if you live in an industrialized country because mat'ls(materials) are easily obtained in such locations. Buy it for educatonal, refference or experimental purpose only. ABC"
4,machine gun review,"A very intresting book explaining the workings of the machine gun with easy to understand text however I dont imagine building one is as straight forward as it seems,an excellant book though."
4,"Excellent, but not complete...","I gave this book 4 stars because it is not complete in certain parts. Fortunately I bought the Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun Book from Gerard Metral from a Shop here in Brasil (Actually I bought those books, because a civilian war is iminent here in Rio de Janeiro, and Brasil now have laws prohibiting the selling of Weapons).Well, the Expedient Homemade Firearms is complete with the aquisition of Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun book, because this book covers important steps that the Expedient Homemade Firearms doesn't cover, like the Parkerization Process, Handgrip manufature and some most technical details.If you wanna make your weapon, buy both books, focus on building the weapon explained in the Expedient Homemade Firearms, and add to it the important details described on Do-It-Yourself book."
4,now this is what I call music,"I saw The Music live in San Francisco a few weeks ago and they put on an incredible show. Although I haven't bought this album, I've downloaded most of it, and all the songs are great. It's not deep, introspective music, but it's a lot of fun to rock out to. If you can afford to shell out for the import I highly reccomend it."
2,On the dry side,"Prayer is divided into two parts: an exposition of what true prayer is and how praying is an appeal to Jesus on his throne of grace. To be frank, this is not Bunyan at his best. He's written better stuff (see Pilgrim's Progress). The material is pretty dry and half the time, he's battling high church Anglicanism. The few diamonds here are his descriptions of prayer being from the heart, not an formulistic external exercise.The backdrop of where the book was written (Bunyan was imprisioned for his Puritan beliefs after Cromwell died and England reverted back to monarchy) is very interesting and I suggest all to familiarize themselves with that interesting period."
2,"The ""Good"" Ibsen","Brand is the flip side of Peer Gynt. Ibsen may well have intended to write heroism into Brand, a charismatic dissenting priest, but could not breathe any life into his protagonist at all. Brand is cold, righteous, merciless, uncompromising. The play is dated, dull, static, but of historical interest to Ibsen scholars, since he may have learned plenty by writing Brand. The rather rigid Norwegian state/church of his time loved it, granted Henrik a permanent poet stipend for Brand. Modern gentle readers may roll their eyes."
2,Not that great,"This single contains two remixes of ""Dance Commander"" and the original album version. The first track is the Benny Benassi Satisfaction Remix. This remix alright, but first two minutes a bit repetitive. The second track is the Fatboy Slim Dub Mix, which is not very good. The music sounds nothing like the original ""Dance Commander"", and the words don't go well with the beat. The third and best track is the album version of ""Dance Commander"". Overall, this single was not that great. I would recommend the other ""Dance Commander"" single which has the tracks ""Dance Commander (Radio Edit)"", ""I Am Detroit"", and ""Dance Commander (Soulchild Extended Night Version)""."
4,Classics for Kids CD,The music is well done and meets my needs. I'm a music teacher in elementary school and have been looking for ways to make classical music interesting to the students. This CD works well with a lesson plan I have developed for the children to learn about Mozart's music.
5,Great Book,"This book is very easy to read and understand.There is a test before starting the book and one at the end.It's a good choice for anyone who wants to improve the reasoning skills and avoid to fall in the traps of thinking, what is common in conversations, relationships, negotiation, etc. If you want to invest low money with a good pay back, this book is the one."
5,Cool Ruler delivers with aplomb,"Gregory Isaacs has oft been referred to as the Frank Sinatra of regge and this is not just hyperbole. The man's phrasing is as subtle as it is ultimately powerfully moving. Before the drugs took their toll on his pipes Isaacs was peerless in reggae for his ability to put a song across. Even the mighty Dennis Brown acknowledged his good friend's talents. All that said Soon Forward is perhaps the Cool Ruler's finest LP. Covering reality themes on Universal Tribulation (an absolutely devestating track) and Black Liberation Struggle et al while also delivering classic Isaacs romanticism on Lonely Girl and the title track. Produced by Isaacs and featuring a band that includes Horsemouth, Bingy Bunny, Sly and Robbie, Ansel Collins, Deadly Headly, Bobby Ellis and Wire Lindo plus backing vocals from Leroy Sibbles (Heptones) Dennis Brown and Junior Delgado, what more do you need to know? If you don't already own it, I feel for you,friend."
3,"Great world building, but disappointing endings.","The Bone Forest is a collection of eight short stories by Robert Holdstock, the first and eponymous one of which is a Mythago Wood narrative from the point of view of George Huxley, about how he came to involve his sons Steven and Christian.The six next (Thorn, The Shapechanger, The Boy Who Jumped the Rapids, Time of the Tree, Magic Man, and Scarrowfell), although not sharing the same settings, are very similar in style and atmosphere.The last one (The Time Beyond Age) tells of a scientific experiment where two children are artificially grown old in a disease-proof environment.As a whole, I like the way Robert Holdstock builds enchanting worlds for us to explore, but I'm always disappointed by the abrupt, sometimes far-fetched endings."
4,Old fashioned but thorough,"I first came across this book back in 1996 in my library, and having been using pages from it ever since, so I finally figured I should buy the whole book :-) I have found it very useful over the years.This book is laid out in alphabetical order, as the title 'encyclopaedia' suggests. This makes it fabulous for looking up techniques quickly. It is a techniques and information book, not a how-to book, as it is not listed in order of categories of techniques or order of difficulty.The look is old-fashioned, and there are not many pictures, but this makes it able to have more information for the same size of book. It is great for checking which paired decrease you need, how to do short rows, altering existing garments and more.I would highly recommend this book as a reference book for your shelf, perhaps paired with a book with more photos (I have bought it paired with Finishing Techniques for Hand Knitters, which I have also reviewed)."
5,outstanding playing and techniques..,"Janet Marlow starts off this CD with a brilliant and articulate piece ""The Bee's"". From there it keeps going and doesn't stop. Her mastery of the 10-string and musical knowledge is all throughout this CD. This should have been nominated for a Grammy. I recommend it."
2,Not acceptable,"The cooling fan motor arrived on time. Labled right on the motor that it fits a 99 3.8L Mustang. Removed the fan assembly and the existing motor from the assembly. First the fan motor is significantly smaller in both diameter and length than the original Ford motor! Next the mounting bracked fits into the existing fan housing but it is 3/4 inches offset from the correct position to align the fan blades with the housing. In a couple of hours I was able to build an adapter by using 3/4"" X 3/8"" spacers and using longer mounting bolts to make it work.If I had to do it over I would spring for the OEM motor even at 3X the price. I wouldn't trust this smaller motor keeping the engine cool while idleing in traffic with the airconditioner on a hot summer day."
4,Back in a big way,"When I first heard that Perry Farrell was releasing a solo album, I thought ""finally!"". And I must say, that now when I have listened at the record thuroughly, that it lives up to all of my expectations. Perry Farrell is and will always be a big rock hero to me, and although his music has changed over the years (from the pounding and energetic Jane's Addiction and so on)he still delivers in a big way. Song Yet To Be Sung is a soft, yet exilirating and magnificent album, with humble tunes as well as some more freaked out, as for example the crazy ""Admit I"". The song ""Song yet to be sung"" itself is a mellow and deep tune. It broke my heart instantly. Buy it!"
1,What a waste of talent,"I have been waiting a while for this album to come out, and this is the best he can come up with? It's all dated!!! There is nothing new or innovatve at all on this album. This coming from Perry is a huge dissapointment. He has lost it, and the only way to stay in the limelight is to re-unite Jane's...once again. Please give me a break! Either stay together or don't re-unite and keep Jane's as it is...a legend. Do not waste your cash on this piece of electronic crap. I would have goven it no stars but unfortunately, amazon doesn't give you that choice."
5,blind boy rules!,"Blind Boy Fuller, among the best of the ""Blind Bluesmen"" (ie Blind WIllie Johnson, Blind Blake, Blind Gary Davis, and Blind Willie McTell), reveals his true talent on this highly reccommended compilation. It contains some of the greatest American music ever to be composed, performed, and recorded! Buy this for the love of God almighty!"
4,It's a nice cd just a lot of reggae people.,The cd is not only latinos but people from the islands so it has that reggae feel to it.
2,IT'S OK,"I LIKE MAYBE 1 OR 2 SONGS FROM THE WHOLE CD. IT IS MAINLY REGGAE, WHICH I DONT LIKE. I'M MORE OF A REGGAETON SHAKE YOUR BOOTY PERRIANDO TYPE OF GIRL"
5,Just Desserts,"Victoria Laurie is one heck of a suspense author, I couldn't put her books down. Instead of taking a week to read, I read it in two days. She really keeps you in suspense the entire book.I've read all her ""psychic"" books and wish there were more."
2,Wasted trees,"Although I don't like to discourage authors from writing I must say this book was diplorable. The story line was terrible, the charachters behaved unbelievably (teenage sister too naive to believe that there is a sex trade,etc) and the response of the lead charachter, Savannah, to someone who is gay is terrible. Also the emphasis of her southern accent and strange references that are supposedly southern is irritating. I better post this message after I sell my book!"
4,Good debut mystery novel,"This is a murder/mystery story with the lead character, Savannah Reid, a detective from San Carmelita investigating the murder of a prestigious designer. I enjoyed the characters in the story including Savannah and her sister Atlanta (their mother names her children after cities in Georgia). The story centers around a not-so-well-liked man, Jonathon Winston, who owns a high end boutique in San Carmlita and is married to a wealthy councilwoman, Beverly Winston. Savannah is placed on the case to investigate the homicide but is unceremoniously dumped from the case due to a clause concerning her ""weight"". This debut novel sets up for Savannah Reid to go into private investigating. The book is entertaining and the mystery keeps you interested."
1,pathetic,"This album would rank, alongside her 'Rainbow' album, as among the worst bankrupt tripe ever foisted on the listening public of the world. Unlike the rest of her catalogue, except the aforementioned 'Rainbow' album, musically this album is bankrupt...aimless pop music. Her voice is the only redeeming quality here, but on her albums you know you're going to get that anyway. So, along with the 'Rainbow' album, it's the music that lets this one down. One to be avoided."
2,Not very well organized,"I have read every Harry Potter book and have studied Philosophy extensively. When I saw this book I thought it an exciting read. I read the first fifty pages and saw many great ideas, yet poorly organized and not very in depth. I expected more Philosophy."
5,aristotle and hogwarts,"unfortunately i havent begun to read it read, because my spouse is VERY ill, and my mother is, as well i feel that when i read this book, i'll have to 'think', and i cant read philosophy w/out thinking SO, i've not read it yet, look forwrd to doing so, but i had absolutely NO problems w/the vendor from whom i would happily purchase books again c bickett"
2,not enough information,"this book does not go into enough depth to be of much use as you shop for dolls. you can use it to get some info on year produced, and to get a rough idea of where each doll fits into the larger scheme, but to do it right, you really need a book that includes much more."
4,Cool Dancehall-Ragga collection,Hey Frank....in Panama we would say to you...CALLATE IGNORANTE!!!.This is one of the best compilation of cool commercial dancehall with big reggae artist on it.Please learn a bit more about reggae before you give such a ignorant opinion.
1,A reggae mix if you dont want reggae!,"I just saw the commercial on television and I would have to say that it is a reggae mix of no reggae songs what so ever. It is all trash with dudes that pretend to have crappy fake jamaican accents. Avoid at all costs. So if you want a reggae mix that doesnt have one reggae song on it, go right ahead and waste your money!"
4,Reef Runner Cicada,"The cicada is a vibrating lure that works well in the cold water of early spring or late fall. I hear that it's also effective through the ice in winter. Most strikes occur ""on the drop"" so work the lure without line slack for best results. I find nickle with red reflective tape seems to simulate gills or blood and it works great for walleye, saugeye, and panfish until the water temperature reaches 64 degrees F. Then they'll still work, but more real food is in the water, so for walleyes jigs or live bait might work better."
5,Ashana shares her gift and beauty,"Ashana's music evokes peacefulness and awareness. When I listen to her, I realize not only ""all is well"" but also ""all is wonderful!"" Easily I recommend Ashana. The music will touch your heart."
5,My Magic Dog,"Great movie for kids and adults as well. This film conveys to the viewer what sentimentality and love from a boy to his dog mean from the beginning to the end. By the term ""end"" I mean that ""true"" love and friendship never fades away. This is a funny, but, touching story of a boy and his dog. That even through a tragic accident that the dog gets killed, the dog comes back to help the boy through tough times. I'm not going to give away anymore about this story. However, I truly recommend buying this one. It was great!"
1,R u kidding?,Thank God this is free on demand. My daughter wanted to watch it when we scrolled thru the movies. This has to be the worst movie with the worst acting that I have ever seen in my life. Ugh!!!!
3,Complete Guide to Sex Toys,"This video has some good information. However, I found it to be lacking in REALLY showing couples using the sex toys in a way that liked real."
5,Anti Icky Poo,"Anti Icky Poo works wonderful on accidents, after clean up our dogs don't return to the spot. I highly recommend it to all our friends who have pets."
5,So far so good,"I am a professional carpet cleaner of 14 years, so I know how hard it can be to get rid of pet odors. I have only had to use AIP once so far for cat odor. I honestly thought I was going to have to Ozone the basement where the odor was. I treated the carpet and left. 2 days later, not even the slightest hint of cat odor was left. I hope they all go this well."
5,Blues Fun? You Bet!,"It's too bad Frank Stokes gets short-shrifted when compared with more voodoo-istic, depressed blues players of the 20's. He and partner Dan Sane are no less virtuoso just because they play really funny stuff (""Mr. Crump Don't Like It."") Here is a blues album you can listen to without intellectualizing it, although lots of references only make sense in historical context. And that voice! It's a curious mix of yelling and harmonizing that has no equal. Mr Crump May Not Like It, but you will!"
2,Sorry Macca Fans,"Sorry Macca fans everywhere, but this record isn't very good. There are a couple of melodies worth noting(San Ferry Anne, Warm and Beautiful), but anything that Silly Love Songs on it really stinks.Again, I'm amazed at how a genius like McCartney can put out such meaningless trite garbage."
4,"It's not great, but it is pretty good","OK. It must be admitted that this is not one of the better Wings albums. It was put together between tours, and kind of feels ""thrown together."" Also, to deal with criticism that Wings was just a vehicle for Paul McCartney, he let each of the band members contribute a song, only adding to the ""thrown together"" feel.But, that said, it is a pretty good album. Most of the songs are pretty good, 1970s tunes, and the hit songs ""Let `Em In"" and ""Silly Love Songs"" add a lot of weight to the album. As a Wings fan, I must say that I liked this album. Yes, it's not great, but it is pretty good, and I enjoyed it."
4,"Digitally Remastered, not improved?","For some reason, most of the 1970-1990 McCartney/Wings catalogue is now available in two versions: the Capitol CDs and the British remastered ""McCartney Collection"".The British CD's offer, in many cases, more bonus tracks than the Capitol CD's, on this release they are the same though. Why not include Junior's Farm???The remastering of the British series is, to my ears, NOT a bonus. The signal has been compressed in such a way, that the average level is louder than on the Capitol CD's, although the peaks are not. The balance has changed: low frequencies have been boosted, resulting in a somewhat muddy sound and a less focused midrange. This has also affected the stereo image. To me, the Capitol CDs are sonically superior and closer to the original LPs.I found the remastered sound a disappointment, not doing justice to the obvious care that went into the original production!"
2,Typical McCartney Solo Album,"This is a typical McCartney/Wings solo album -- a few good songs and the rest filler (if not junk). Linda McCartney' song, Cook of the House, has to be one of the all time WORST songs. But, Silly Love Songs, Let 'Em In, and Beware My Love redeem this disk, somewhat."
3,"Shoulda',Coulda',Woulda' But Didn't","Paul McCartney was aiming for the ultimate Wings album byhaving Denny Laine and other members contribute songs and he lost BIG TIME with ""Speed Of Sound"".Clearly it'sMcCratney's contributions that even register like the classic hits in the Beatlesqe pop of ""Let 'Em In"" and the more orchestrated uptempo pop-disco self parody of ""Silly Love Songs"".The Aerosmith-like hard rock of ""Beware Of Love"",the wonderful blue-eyed soul of ""She's My Baby"",the classic McCartney ballad ""Warm And Beautiful"" and even wife Linda's kitchy ""Cook Of The House"" are the only highlites.If you can dub off those six tracks you'll be saved from having to by this erratic album.Sorry!"
3,"Silly Love Songs, Or Vapid?","McCartney's specialty, even when he was with the Beatles, was creating slight, trite hooky blandness. Freed from the creative pressures of the `greatest rock band in the world' he expresses his cheap sentimentality and vapid hook worship with boundless abandon. Is this not the message of `Silly Love Songs'? The album will not inspire passion in many; it's so bland as to be unnoticeable, muzak for the rock generation. But who needs to own elevator music?"
3,Wings at full stride,"The most popular Wings' lineup makes mid-'70s pop, with many pretty but somewhat forgettable songs. Unique to this album is that everyone in the band sings a lead--even the drummer, Joe English, and Linda, to mixed effect.The two huge singles (Let 'Em In and Silly Love Songs) are just as annoying as you remember them, good examples of Paul's sometimes poor ability to be more self-critical.On this disc are three bonus cuts, including a catchy and credible country tune, Sally G.If you like Paul, this is a must-have."
2,Wings at the Speed of Decline,"After the high standards established by ""Band on the Run"" and ""Venus and Mars,"" Paul McCartney and Wings display their group unity by producing a remarkably mediocre album. Released to coincide with the band's American tour, ""Wings at the Speed of Sound"" (1976) has two hit singles - ""Silly Love Songs"" and ""Let 'Em In"" - the snappy rocker ""Beware My Love"" and plenty of obvious filler. The low point is Linda's embarrassing ""Cook of the House."" Despite the tour's phenomenal success, the decline of Wings as a studio entity begins here."
3,Patchy,"As with many Macca albums, this is patchy. There are fantastic songs, such as 'warm and beautiful', a gorgeous piano ballad. 'Let em in' is just genius. Catchy and original. 'Silly love songs' has received much flack, but is a clever soft rock song, with a great driving bass line. 'Beware my love' is the only rock song on here. It is very good, except Linda is doing out of tune harmony vocals, that really take away from the main melody. Linda also sings lead on 'cook of the house', and this has to be the most dire recording in the Macca catalogue. She is out of tune, the melody is non existent and the lyrics are awful. I also find Denny's 'Time to hide' tuneless and boring. It is a hit and miss album."
3,Wings at the speed of the music business,"A lighter follow-up to Band on the Run and Venus and Mars. While the songs don't sound as inspired as some of the earlier McCartney/Wings material, the subtle yet intricate arrangements of the songs shows McCartney to still be a groundbreaker as a producer and arranger. Though the band might have been under some pressure to get an album out in time for the next big tour, McCartney and band-mates still took time to select only the finest musical ingredients. All-in-all a listenable album with some catchy pop songs and a little experimentation thrown in for balance."
2,Worth It for Beware My Love and 2 Hits....,"If there's anything to be said about Wings At The Speed Of Sound is that the album is really worth it for 1 track - ""Beware My Love"".It's the only place where you'll find the studio version of this song -- other than on the B-side of the Let 'Em In Single.Now why this song was NOT released on Wingspan, is beyond me.Other than that - the only other songs that are good IMO is Time To Hide (the WOA version is far better) and the 2 hit singles Let Em In and Silly Love Songs.Part of the problem is that Paul decided to split the album up among the other members of Wings -- giving the album a collaborative feel. Other than the Denny Lane tracks, it doesn't really work.Bottom Line: If you are interested in obtaining the song Beware My Love, go for it. But be forwarned, you'll be sleeping through most of it."
3,"This album is Wings , pop rock , not a Beatles record","People expect a lot from Paul ( understandable , but he is human ) however this album is not about him so much .Rather , this album features lead vocals from a few other singers , but that's what makes it so interesting to my ears .Imagine Paul as a producer on other people's songs and you get the idea . I first got this on cassette years ago and it caught my attention then and I rediscovered it recently .It is music with mostly soft edges , though 'Beware of my Love' starts to build up steam and is the closest the album comes to rock .If you're looking for a chill out record , you may find this fits the bill nicely ."
4,Fretless Bass Glory,"The title of this CD talks for itself - music inspired by genius of BASS player Jaco pasTORIUS. Jaco 'was one of THE cats' how one of musicians once said about him. He became an historical figure in the world of music, for his revolutionary new approach for bass guitar and new style of thinking of it. This CD features some of noted bass players like Laurence Cottle, Dave La Rue and Carlos Benavent, presenting their vision of fretless bass playing style based on Pastorius works. They bring the bass in more advanced level, demonstrating how it can fit an almost all niches in song structure. Sometimes you will be surprised how different the bass may sound. With this CD in your collection you can share your feels and ideas about fretless bass with many hot musicians, who love it like you do."
4,Who's afraid of Beowolf,"A fun Sci-Fi rompt combining the sensibility of a modern day archeologist who unwittingly finds herself helping a band of Vikings roused from a 1,000 year sleep."
3,Live-to-Live Attitude,"It is a strange movie.Suffering communicating problems because of his odd birthmark and financial situation, same gender attracted Harry found himself solaced by mature Flint, a sweet murderer, crook and womanizer with a string of stories untold.A produce is of a good audio quality, a sort of a romantic tragic comedy of which live-to-live attitude rules."
5,A wonderfully informative tour of what community libraries have to offer,"Informatively written for children ages four through eight by Kitty Shea, and colorfully illustrated by Zachary Trover, Out And About At The Public Library is an ideal picturebook introduction to what kids will find at their local community library. Boys and girls will learn what is available at community libraries in addition to books; what kinds of questions librarians can answer; whether or not using the library costs anything; even what happens to books after they are returned to the library after hours through those little slots in the library doors or walls. A strongly recommended addition to both school and community library picturebook collections for preschool and elementary school children, Out And About At The Public Library is a wonderfully informative tour of what community libraries have to offer and how to use library resources -- including the acquisition of a library card!"
5,Finally Some HELP!,This book really helped me know what my rights are and how to handle my landlord. It helped me understand my lease and now I know how to get my landlord to fix things. There is lots of info about anything that could come up while renting. Great book to have around even if you aren't having a problem.
4,Classic comedy at its best,"Cheech & Chong's drug oriented humor found a large & loyal audience in the early 1970's-Now,the good folks at Rhino Records have seen fit to include all their classic routines on a double CD package-These guys were true originals & the fact that they did all the character voices themselves is truly impressive-My favorite cuts are ""Sister Mary Elephant"",""Basketball Jones"" featuring Tyrone Shoelaces,""Earache My Eye"", & ""Framed""-Also included is a fantastic booklet written by noted novelty record expert Barry Hansen,who's better known as Dr.Demento-Too bad this collection doesn't contain a huge wad of rolling papers (Note:rolling papers were found inside C&C's second album,""Big Bambu"" in 1972)-Anyway,if you have fond memories of Cheech & Chong or are just discovering them for the first time,you've got to buy this set-As they said way back when:""It's far out,man""."
2,Way Over my Head,Even though I hold a masters degree I am not able to follow the techno lingo in this book. It seems its written by engeneers for wanna-be-engeneers. It holds some interesting descriptions on appliances and other solar gadgets but it is certainly not for the everage person intersted in the solar energy field. Is it not possible to write a simple book. This kind of book hurts more then it helps because it dicourages.
4,Amazing,"I first heard Izzy on a talk-show in Portugal. She was singing ""My Love is Like a Red Rose"" from her album ""Ascolta""... I was, positively, in state of shock. With this wonderful singer I begin to enjoy arias, opera, and become more interested in languages as french and italian to understand and sing the lyrics. I get emotional everytime I put the CD on the player as it's such a great sensation of freedom, peace and beauty that she carries in her voice. A great album with classical and traditional pieces (as usual in her records)."
1,$15 dollars for less than 10 minutes of film,"I was really disappointed when I received this DVD. From start to end, it ran less than ten minutes. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling this for $15 dollars. I wish I could get my money back :("
5,A real find!,This book has great stories and recipes for the Holy Days during the Liturgical year. Very quaint and a darling of a book.
2,a yawn,"Tom is a gay professor at a college in New York City. He reconnects with an old childhood friend, Ritchie. Ritchie, then, begs him to join him as he has set up an upcoming date with an Internet friend.Meanwhile, Tom has a platonic relationship with a ""bi"" student, whom he guides through about life using a series of poetry.Between Ritchie and his student, Tom flashes back in his life to his younger days with Ritchie and a dear friend, Zach, who has since died from AIDS.Contemplation and redemption is constant throughout the novel. Simply, a yawn."
3,A Review,"Some lively writing (both in his fiction and his responses).THat being said, is there anything more pathetic than a narcissistic author responding to negative reviews of his work? I'm certain Mr. Weir will come up with a ""snarky"" answer to that very question, chock full of golden-era movie references, which coincidentally takes up the loin's share of his work. Enough already. Reference a Jim Varney flick, and maybe I'd be impressed. Then proceeding to explain the motives of both the author AND the characters? Sad. Creative Writing 101: Show, don't tell.Perhaps if the author concentrated on writing original engaging fiction, rather that cattily responding to negative reviews and drawing parallels to Ether Williams (see, name-dropping's easy), he's be able to crank out more than one novel every sixteen years."
1,A Mess,"I'm afraid I'll have to agree with Publishers Weekly on this one. It's a chattering, clattering mess that fails to obscure the complete lack of a novel underneath the noise. Perhaps Mr. Weir should try a memoir?"
3,know-it-all bore,"Spending 243 pages with a compulsive guy (the professor) who needs to tell you everything he knows was not that enjoyabe for me. Sure, the author created a ""real"" person---but isn't such a character someone you try to avoid? Wier lets his other characters comment on the professor's tendency to ""kill the moment,"" but the fact that the author may have intended to create a bore, did not improve the reading experience. Further, the professor's cataloguing tendency extends to the author. Page 112 is a prime example of this. While a student is taking ONE step into his office we are asked to believe that the professor is able to conjure up Henry James' father, characters from Hemingway and Williams, and Kerouac's broken leg, received in a college football game. Really? The story is held together by several improbable coincidental meetings and padded with literary references and gay history---none of which seemed all that organic to me."
5,This 2 cds Box is an excellent buying.,"These are the Dvorak masterworks originally composed for Piano Duet.Later, all these compositions were orchestrated but the piano performance by Ingryd Thorson & Julian Thurber is excellent and lovely too.This 2-cds Box recording on label Brilliant (at a low cost) is a ""must"" for all Dvorak lovers.Complete Slavonic Dances, Legends and From the Bohemian Forest are really great to listen on piano duet."
2,"Good Movie, but Be Careful!","You don't see the part that says, ""Will not play on US DVD Players"" until you look around a bit. You may wind up wasting $60 like I did."
4,A good take on Rommel's actions in Africa,"This is an interesting book mostly because of the viewpoint of the author. The author is a German who does not think Rommel was all that great. And so you have the whole series of events in Africa viewed from a critical German perspective.And as he says, Rommel was very lucky in who he had as opponents. The British were horribly led in the begining (with some notable exceptions) leading to numerous German victories.This is not a ""must read."" But it is worth the time and the unique viewpoint of the author makes it quite informative."
2,Trip lever for Toto is weak link,Our toilet is only 8 years old and is only used a few times a day. So there is no reason why the old TOT trip lever should break. And it is irritating that it is so expensive. I wanted the gray one to match our existing gray trip lever. But it is back ordered (even on the Toto web site). So we got chrome. Not happy.
4,TOTO lever,"About 30% less expensive than buying the item locally. Very fast shipping!The TOTO lever can actually be replaced with a much less expensive item from HD or Lowe's, but I wanted the matching beige color."
5,Toto flush handle,Perfect. Needed to Bend the wire a little to adjust the height / angle. After that it was perfect. Installation was easy and it was Ythentic TOTO. Quite pleased with quality and price.
2,THU068#CP Trip Lever,"What a disappointment. I bought this through a plumber (way expensive as it turns out), and after insalling, I found that it does not lift the flapper enough to cause a proper flush, nor does the handle come back up to its full upright position after release. I have sent email to Toto to see what can be done."
1,"Frankly, I've read better","I'd recommend Contreras' earlier works in lieu of this one. In particular, his text ""Mantequillas de los Tomates"" (later adapted for film under the title ""Adventures in Babysitting"") addresses similar issues but with none of the pretense with which this book is infused."
2,"Thin, unbalanced pad","Mat was much thinner than I expected, and pretty much useless. The top cover isn't comfortable for bare feet, the bottom padding doesn't even cover the whole mat, comes in a good 2"" from each side, and at that didn't offer much padding. Definitely not worth the price."
2,"Maybe not plagiarized...but not fiction, either","Anyone who has lived in Atlanta since the nineties will recognize the plotline of this ""fiction"" novel from the get-go. I won't spoil it, but the story was absolutely ripped from the headlines about an infamous Atlanta murder the year before this book was released.However, I still enjoyed the characterizations of Callahan, Edna (my favorite character), Miss Baby and Sister, and Neva Jean. I just think it's a shame to capitalize on a horrific real-life murder for a ""cozy"" mystery story."
4,"Light, Enjoyable Read","I don't usually go for such light-hearted mysteries, I prefer more gore and murder. But I picked this up after a friend recommended it to me, and I was not disappointed. Having grown up in and around Atlanta my whole life, it was fun to read the fictional events and actually picture where they were taking place. I could just see where the murder occured, where Callihan lived and ate, where her relatives lived. I guess that was the most appealing thing about this book. You may have to live in Atlanta to truly like it.That said, the story was quick and interesting. You know almost from the beginning 'whodunnit', but keep reading to see him get caught. I don't think this book was as close to the Tokars case as some may think, but there were some similarites. I picked this book up on Saturday morning and was done by the next day. I may read more of her books, if just to enjoy the local setting a bit more."
3,its ok...,"it feels cheap, like the Coleman products made in china. The metal is thin and I fear it wont last more than a couple seasons. It does work fantastically as a lantern holder, but standing over the heat of a fire is going to wear on it quickly."
3,It's good...,"We used this all week while we were camping...I loved it as the lantern holder and could take it or leave it as a grill... As a lantern holder it was quick and easy to move it wherever we wanted... As a grill it was very awkward to move food around since it swings around a lot as soon as you touch it - works perfectly with pots and pans - just not with food directly on the grill.Also as a plus in our campsite it became our ""Cell Phone Tower"". At the top where the 3 poles come together my husbands cell phone fit perfectly! ha ha ha! It just happened to be the only spot in our campsite where we actually had reception - go figure! ;)"
3,Camping,Our neighbor had one of these. We were eager to puchase one and read it came with a cover which it did not. Now we have to find something to store it in. Makes it hard to put it in the camper without the bag for storage.
3,"Good ti-pod, great for the price.","I have had more than one brand of these and they all seem to last on or two seasons. This one is by far the least expensive and it lasts about the same. For $20.00 it can easily be replace every other season. If you only use them a few times a year it would last five or six years. We use ours at the fire pit in our back yard as well as camping. This is a light duty grill. If the Grill itself wears out before the legs do, replace it with a webber coal grill it will last 10 years."
5,My Soul impression was good,A very clear and informative demonstration of Spiritual Kinesiology. I had no prior knowledge of the subject but after watching the DVD a couple of times I felt able to use the technique myself. Very impressive. Very empowering.
3,Very informative but the mots rigid presentors I have aver seen,The DVD is very informative and easy to follow but I wish the presentors were more animated and pleasent to watch. I was more impressed with their book than the DVD.
5,Reet,"Is this a great album? Yes, a selection of Smiths hits is always gonna be a winner. This was infact my introduction to them aged 20 some years ago. Well, i think it was as boy, there are so many of these bleeding compellations.I cannot stress more, go and buy the actual albums. Start a thread on best smiths songs and what will you get? A great frigging argument as there are so so many great songs that mean so much to people. Rusholme Ruffians, The Queen Is Dead, Reel Around The Fountain, where are they? B sides and album tracks. Go forth and search and make your own compellation, it's the only way."
2,frankly vulgar,"The smiths a band of the nineties? Anyway, despite the fact that Morrissey and Marr were very against the release of this album the songs are great. Marr's guitar playing is the best and Morrissey's lyrics are wonderful. The songs do not sound that much better from the older albums. I suggest people just get an older album that the Smiths actualy wanted to release and that is not full of printing errors in the song titles. Oh yes, the Smiths were an 80's band that have inspired many bands of today, not a 90's grunge band."
2,"Love the movies, just wish I could get a reasonably priced DVD of them","This reviews is not for the films themselves, as I am my family love them, the 2 movies themselves would get 5 STARS, this is the fact that for close to a year now I have been trying to buy the DVD for something close to 20 bucks, at the most and I can never find anyplace selling them for that price, because they are out of print from what I have heard, if they would bring this back out at a reasonable price, not the 40+ price tag, for USED copies, that is rediculous, anyways if you have that kinda extra cash then pay it, the movies are great, I just hate the high prices, if this get re-released or start selling at a reasonable price, I would be more than willing to change my review."
5,One of the finest made for tv movies!!,It was 25 years ago the viewing public was introduced to Bill Sackter thanks to two made for tv movies on the life of this individual. Mickey Rooney deserved the awards for his role as a man who was an institution for 66 years and later learning life in Iowa City. This is a movie that demonstrates the human spirit in each of us. A good double feature for a nice price!
2,Dense,"Even coming from a strong interest in Vedanta, I found this book extremely dense, seemingly arguing details of Christian theology in long, complicated sentences full of jargon and untranslated Latin. Moreover, the book takes great pain to be ""politically correct"" against Catholic theology and dogma, leaving the impression that without this there is no possiblity of Truth. This prejudice colors my perception the the text. All this is not to say that there are not a few diamonds in the all details, but as might be said in a business setting, there is a great deal of paralysis by analysis here."
4,Fun gift for a serious cook,I gave this book to my brother for his birthday. Everyone had a few good laughs over the different recipes. I am worried that a Twinkie Salad or Twinkie Tiramasu may show up at the next family gathering.
3,Very strange book,"When I bought this book, I intended it to be more of a gag gift than anything. Personally, I would describe most of the recipes that the books contains to be ""inedible."" With that said, it delivers exactly what it promises: Various abominable things to do with Twinkies, which includes ""twinkie sushi"" which I both gagged and laughed at.While I do not enjoy twinkies, in any way, somebody who does would probably enjoy this book. At a minimum, it would at least entertain them."
5,Comfort Food at its Best,"What a wonderful little book! This book takes childhood comfort food to a new level. If you are a babyboomer, this book is a must--even if you do not cook. If you are not a babyboomer, buy the book anyway--you will not be sorry.Ed Rigsbee, author, PartnerShift--How to Profit from the Partnering Trend"
5,Amazing Bit of Americana - Who Knew You Could Do All This With a Twinkie,"This book is so good on several levels.You can goof on it: Who ever thought up these ideas? Why did they do it?You can read it for fun ideas of things to make with Twinkies for your next party.You can read it and appreciate the American spirit, which inspires people to take a very basic and generally well-loved sweet treat/junk food, and create the most amazing desserts with it.I use it to show my foreign students a little of how we Americans approach life, with a humor and funkiness, and, I think, a basic lack of fear."
2,"Cute, but recipes aren't great.","My hubby loves Twinkies and received this book from a coworker. The past 2 birthdays, instead of home-made Twinkies, he has chosen a recipe from this book for me to make for his birthday. Last year was TwinkieHenge, and it was AWFUL. This year, he chose more a cake-style recipe, and it was better, but still not right because the directions stated to cut the Twinkies the wrong way to put them in the batter. So, it's just a cake with chunks of Twinkie in it. I suggest if you love Twinikies...get an extra few boxes of them instead of wasting your money on this book."
4,"Great Journal, Some References are Outdated","I LOVE this journal. I've used several of them over the years. It has plenty of room for your itinerary and expenses, and enough journal pages for a long trip or for pasting in little mementos like ticket stubs, pressed flowers, or small photos. I use Post-It Write-On tabs so I can find sections at a glance. The plastic cover is durable and protects the journal well from dirty hands, rain, etc. Since this journal is out of print, some of the references are out of date. Who uses traveller's checks anymore? I usually have to buy my copies used because new ones are not plentiful. Luckily, I've gotten them with only minimal markings and those were easily obliterated with correction tape. I wish Ten Speed Press would issue a new edition. I'd give it 5 stars if it was updated."
4,I Roy's attack,"I Roy is probably one of my top 3 favorite chanters in Reggae music. His style, wit, and cleverness put him in top rankin fe sure. Musical Shark Attack however is not one of his strongest albums, but make no mistake, the biting social commentary, black pride lyrics ride high and the music of course is brilliant. Fitting his lyrical attack all throughout. Standout cuts: ""Love I a Deal With"", ""Tribute to Marcus Garvey"" and the outrageous ""Semi Classical Natty"", are strong tunes. As always, I miss the great I Roy, there are not many chanters left with his style, class and charm."
3,Not working as 3 way switch,"There are two styles of this Mogul base lamp socket- on/off and 3 way. The on/off style was about half the price of the 3 way.I was looking to replace with a 3 way and this was advertised as such. I replaced my old socket with this part and put in a new Mogul 3 way bulb (100,200,300W), but only get on/off.So, the lamp is working, and I won't replace anytime soon, but this part was a disappointment."
1,product missing knob to turn light on,"this was not a very good product after replacing the old mogel base, went to check the knob, however, there was no knob included with the product. Without the knob it is of no use, because you cannot turn the light on. somewhere along the line i received an e mail stating that they would send the knob, but as of this date i have not received one. I checked all the stores within 15 miles of where i live however they do not sell a knob separately. So my 100 year old floor lamp sits there, and i am unable to use it since i do not have the knob! I would like a refund or a knob or a new mogel base with the knob included..I hope this is something you could do for me since i purchase a lot of things from amazon. sincerely, al fagundes"
5,"Good quality product, as pictured.","Some people complain that the mask they received was too short, was that was not the case with mine. It was as described and double layered, adding to the warmth and quality. AND! It was cheap, I highly recommend it. If you get unlucky and they send you one that is short and not like the picture simply email them and I am sure they will send you another."
2,Shortie,"This ski mask is of good material: However I found it to be a little short in the neck. When the mask is pulled up over the nose, the mask leaves the neck area esposed. It does not come all the way down as shown in the picture. I am 6' tall and do not have a long face."
2,Too short,"My product arrived fast but it was different from the image posted here. While the quality is good, it is short and the hole is too big, twice as big as in the picture. I wanted a balaclava that only exposes my eyes but if I try to adjust it, my neck becomes exposed. They must have sent me a wrong one or an irregular."
1,ski mask,"the ski mask is not NEARLY as long as pictured. it does not cover the neck, it only covers the chin at best."
2,Too short!,"The mask is way too short. It barely is enough to go over your chin, much less cover any part of your neck. If you try to adjust the mask so that only your eyes show, then it rides up high and your neck is totally exposed."
1,Unethical shipping policy,"I was very excited to order this project, only to be extremely dismayed by the company's shipping policy. They were charging me to ship each item individually, over $4 PER ITEM, for 20 masks. My shipping came to over $60, for standard shipping, for an item that couldn't possibly weigh enough to warrant that kind of shipping. I figured it was a glitch of some sort, but when I contacted the seller directly to inquire, they said it was Amazon's policy to group items into one order, but that they (the seller) still charged a $3 shipping fee per item, regardless. I can't stand it when sellers do this bait and switch - offer a really low price on an item and then make up for it by overcharging you for shipping. I see this sort of practice on E-bay a lot, but never expected to see it on Amazon!"
2,Wouldn't buy again,"Definitely not as pictured. The hole is oddly-shaped, and the front barely covers the chin. Spend the extra few dollars and get one on eBay."
1,Horrible.,"The only good thing about this product is that it arrived on time. The fabric is different, the seams around the eye hole and bottom were horribly done and the two layers of fabric were uneven. The eyehole was small and the neck of the mask only went down to right below my chin. It didn't even touch my neck. Overall, this is the worst thing I've ever bought. Don't buy from this provider or else all you'll get is a cheap reject that was made in China."
2,"one size fits all, or not","I ordered 2 of these masks, one blue and one grey. They're supposed to be one size fits all but the blue one was much larger than the grey. In fact, the grey must have been a child's ski mask because it was too tight along the forehead (painfully tight) and the part that is supposed to cover the neck, only covered half the neck. I had to take a pair of scissors and cut the elastic around the eye hole so that it wouldn't be so tight.It would be a great mask (I know because the blue one that fits is great) but you can't trust the seller - misleading.I noticed that the blue one was sent from a different seller even though they were both ordered at the same time. I won't order from this seller again."
4,Hat,"Good product just what I thought it would be keeps my face warm. Material is nice, just a normal ski mask."
2,Not for average sized adults,"Reasonable fabric - Eye opening works fine - Way too tight for my head - I gave it to my grandson and it fits him fine - Pretty cost effective also, so buy one for your kids BUT do not buy it for the adults"
5,son loves it,"just what we were looking for --very nice at this price, WOW!! we bought the black too and are pleased with both......"
5,does the job.,"Purchest for a 7 year old that loves to play ningas. On a cold snow day I used it to shovel the drive way. IT fit just fine, and kept me nice and worm."
2,Get whatu pay for,Pros:1. CheapCons:1. though it does protect u from the wind ...i found it a bit porous.2. the stuff stinks like hell and needs a wash before first use.3. found the visor irritating
3,Decent,"1) 100% Polyester2) Not the ribbed fabric shown in the picture, just a flat weaveYou get what you pay for."
2,Hole is too small,The mask is of good quality but the hole for the eyes is too small (O ordered a BLACK one). I bought this for my 9 years old but it only will be useful for my toddler. It fits loose to my toddler but the hole for the eyes is made for his size. It cover the neck for an adult but I can not see anything since it covers the sides of my eyes.
5,The AYES have it.,"A good quality, heavy material ski mask. It certainly beats a scarf and hat. Makes snow blowing a much easier task in the winter temps."
4,Face Ski Mask,"Product was what we expected, was delivered in a very timely manner.We were very satisfied, would order again if the need arises."
3,keeps on moving into your face,the hole part is big enough so you can put your whole face in. The only problem is that if your on constant movement it moves and goes over your eyes.
4,Good basic mask,"Bought this for a 5 year old who ""Spy Mask"" and spifically pointed this one out. He was very happy. It pulls up over his mouth and nose just like he wanted."
5,Worth the wait,"We saw John for the first time in Reno, NV and did indeed ask ""who the hell is this guy?"" We enjoyed his performance so much that we asked about purchasing the songs he performed. Although this CD was due out November 2002, it was definitely worth the wait. I agree with the customer reviewer who stated that the Amazon reviewer doesn't ""get"" John's sense of humor. All the songs touch you in some way if you really listen. This is my new favorite CD too!! If you can find him on the West Coast by all means see him and definitely buy this CD."
3,"Should be ""Where"" and not ""Who""","John Eddie is an unbelieveable live performer and has written some of the greatest lyrics ever. What's more frustrating is that so many of them were on songs that have never seen the light of day other than in his live shows. ""Pretty as Sin"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are two that immediately come to mind. Other of his earlier should-have-been hits like ""Romance"", ""Stranded"" or ""Buster"", are inspired as well while his cover versions of songs like ""In Between Days"" and ""Suspicious Minds"" are equally exciting.Once again, though, the recorded version is far short of what John is capable of doing. With a couple of worthwhile exceptions, what comes across on this CD is a dry mixture of frustration bordering on self-pity rather than the bravado and brilliance that John frequently produces on stage and with a pen and paper.He's definitely worth seeing any time you can! On CD it's sometimes another story."
2,A disappointment,"After all the years of down time between record deals, this fan expected more than this generic offering that barely catches fire when it tries to rock and bores this listener when it slows down."
1,Almost Offensive,"I picked this up for free from a radio station otherwise I never would have spent good money on it. The songs John Eddie thinks are funny aren't. I just don't have any sympathy that he is 40. And even the song that gets airplay ""Let Me Down Hard"" is just plain boring. And is there any reason that John Eddie really has to put out an album that I can't play around my kids?"
3,I know now!,"I had heard of John Eddie, a fellow Jerseyan, but never heard his music until I saw him at an outdoor music fest in Philly in the summer of '02, and he just about stole the show. I see why he is a favorite of Springsteen's - he is a solid roots-rocker who leans toward the country side and doesn't have to take himself too seriously. This is an enjoyable record - while not all the tunes are memorable, ""Let Me Down Hard"" is one of the prettiest tunes I heard all last year. ""Play Some Skynyrd"" is a great mock-anthem to unappreciative audiences everywhere, and ""Forty"" is a hoot (though, like Springsteen, I'm almost ""F**kin' fifty-three""). It's a great comeback, of sorts, for a guy who's paid some dues in recent years - this is a fine payoff. Three-and-a-half stars."
3,who the hell is John Eddie?,"he's a pretty witty guy apparently... nicely done... i can't say every song here is a gem, but there are definitely some big winners! my favs are ""Jesus is coming"" and ""40""..."
4,"""attempts at humor""??","Moerer must have lost his since of humor. I laughed outloud listneing to ""Forty"" the first time. As the album title suggests, I had never heard of John Eddie until I Pandora'd The Hangdogs the other day. in my opinion, some of the best music in America today comes from bar bands like these whose music does not fit some radio station format. ""Who the hell are they?"" should become a music category until itself so the listneing public could more easily find serious singer-songwriters like John Eddie and Matthew Grimm."
4,classic song writing,"John Eddie has created some classic songs on his new Cd; ""Who The Hell Is John Eddie"". His song writing is touching at times and his intensions are clearly communicated. The music is excellent, a great production. He is best on the serious songs.""If You're Here When I Get Back"", is a classic. This song will be played forever. ""Play Some Skynyrd"" is a great anthem for all creative people. Many of the songs from this Cd are getting a lot of air time in Northern California. This is a very enjoyable music experience."
4,I liked this one.,"I've listened to ""If You're Here When I Get Back"" a lot since I've downloaded it from itunes. Waaaaay back when I was a John Eddie fan, visiting dive bars at the Jersey Shore. (Some of the best times...) The lyrics & tunes gently breeze by. Bruce-esque, perhaps a bit, but John Eddie has his unique sound, and I enjoy it. It's really good -- give it a try!"
2,Disappointing,"I really tried to love this novel. I enjoy historical murder mysteries, stories with a female sleuth, and the Elizabethan period. So I gave it many, many chances. And I just couldn't bring myself to like it. The heroine's marriage doesn't seem believable, her attitude towards life and the world rings wrong not only for the period but for a woman of any era, and her relationship with Queen Elizabeth I is contrived at best. The secondary characters seem stiff and uni-dimensional and the story felt like a modern tale with a few anachronistic phrases thrown in and the technology taken out.What I did enjoy, however, were the descriptions of places. In this the author excelled and that is what earned this book that second star from me."
4,"not as good as the first, but still a good read",As much as I enjoyed the first book I was a little disappointed with this one. It ran a little slow and I found myself at times skimming for some pages. When the book finally did heat up though I was on the edge of my seat and it was hard to put the book down. I definitely want to continue the series. I can definitely overcome the slow spots to continue with a good story.
3,Great CD but not for MACS,I'm sure this CD had great contents but what it fails to mention in the description is that it does not work with the MAC OS :( Very sad to have to return this item.
5,given as a gift...,And he loved it! Was delivered on time - as it was for a birthday it was perfect. The person that received this really appreciated it and is enjoying learning from it.
5,Excellent Reading!!!! Fantastic Storyline!!!!!,"I have never read a book that had me so involved with the characters. I've read the book over and over again looking for something unreal in the storyline but each time I seem to get even more enthused. I felt for both Leah and Jason. Gail's character, as well as Joe's and Spano's, were true to life. The emotions were so real. I think every facet of having an interracial relationship was properly explored. THIS BOOK DEFINITELY NEEDS A SEQUEL. WE NEED TO KNOW HOW THEIR MARRIAGE AND GAIL AND ALLEN'S MARRIAGE FEARED. MS KITT THINK ABOUT THAT!!!!"
5,You will do some soul-searching as you read this book!,I really appreciated Kitt's realistic tale of interracial romance and the confusion that often accompanies it. I felt as though Leah and Jason were everyday people experiencing true emotions.
4,Realistic IR Romance,"I loved this book. I'm a black woman who fell in love with a white man. I was with him for almost three years, and let me tell you, this book touched on every one of the issues we faced. Leah and Jason were strong characters, however, I thought that Leah was a bit too...soft. I know that she was trying to make Leah a strong, yet very soft and sensitive person, but I feel she went alittle over the top. However, I totally recommend this novel."
4,Strong story with characters to care for,"I think that overall this is a story of two people who were meant to be together, regardless of race or anything else. There was a connection from the very beginning that they couldn't deny. I did like Sandra's characterizations of Leah and Jason, but I do agree to some extent, with the criticisms leveled at the Gail/Allen storyline. But I will say, in Leah's defense, that after what Allen did to her, coming at the end of a long time of ambivalant feelings towards him, that at that point she was beyond caring about him one way or the other. And I think she was very hurt at what her sister had done, but she definitly could have gotten more angry. Gail DID NOT deserve to get what she wanted. But I think if Sandra writes a sequal (hint, hint) that we'll see that ultimately she didn't. Good job Sandra."
3,Good Book,"I read this book in a couple of days and I really liked it. However, I felt that the characters got annoyed too quickly about everything. It seemed to me that the author's favorite word was ""annoyed"" and she really overused that word. Also, I felt that the main character was too passive and she let people push her around, especially her sister. This book wasn't the greatest book I ever read but it was good enough and captivated me for the most part."
3,an okay read,"the book has an interesting premise which is why I bought it in the first place. it was my first Sandra Kitt novel and my second i/r romance.my problem was that the story just wasn't steamy enoughI personally like my romance novels to have some kick and this didnt do it for methe love scene is very bland..and thats the most important part of the bookI also didnt care for the way she dealt with her sister,she really should have fought her[I won't spoil]or at least slapped her."
2,Thought It Was Just Me,"I thought I was the only one who saw the ludicrousness of the story line between the sister sleeping with the boyfriend and the tart way they interacted. Red flags should have been raised with Leah, instead of the ""oh well"" attitude she had everytime her boy friend and her sister were in the same room.I found the sister over the top and WAY too catty to be real and neither she nor the boyfriend had enough flesh and bones to give cause for their behaviors. I never found out why.I did like the interactions between Leah and Jason and found that the most endearing part of the novel, but the high praises this book got did not mesh with the overall story and it's nice to know that it wasn't just me who 'didn't' get it."
3,Just okay. Kind of dark,"This was just okay for me, and that is almost a stretch. There was way too much betrayal and bitterness for me. Gail was a TRIP!!! It's good to see the different facets of love but I thought this needed to be a little more upbeat."
5,Sandra Kitt does it once again,"This story by Kitt was by far the most romantic and heart felt story I've read in a long time. I could not put the book down. The characters were believable and real. The love that Leah and Jason had was true and genuine despite the obstacles they had to go through. But in the end love prevailed and showed that color or race wasn't the issue even though society puts pressure on that element, but loving someone and being loved in return is the greatest reward of all."
4,absolutely fabulous,"I LOVED THIS BOOK. THE STORYLINE WAS BELIEVABLE AND TOUCHING. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THERE WASN'T MORE. I WOULD HAVE MORE DESCRIPTION IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS. I ALSO WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE DESCRIPTIVE AND LONGER LOVE SCENES. BUT, ALL IN ALL IT WAS A FABULOUS STORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,An okay interracial love story,"An interracial love develops despite the usual obstacles (family, friends, co-workers, etc.). I could never truly picture Leah's character as an enterprising black woman and I also had trouble with Jason's inability as a ""street-smart"" cop to see trouble coming. Otherwise, an okay book."
3,A nice read.,"This was my first Sandra Kitt book. It was listed as a recommendation if you liked A ship Made of Paper by Scott Spencer, and I did, for the most part, so I picked it up.I have to say it's a departure from most of the romance novels I read, and I've read several. There was a lot of DETAIL about things I didn't necessarily care about. The story and the characters were certainly well develeoped, almost to the point of being overdeveloped, but it was still good. It did lack steam. I wanted more from the sex. And I was furious about how Leah handled the situation with her sister, and just how she let Gail talk to her in general. It seemed as though Leah had no real backbone, and that ruined the story for me. All in all, and okay read. I agree that there should have been a epiloge. Could have been a great book with better sex and a stonger female lead charachter."
5,Dramatic Read,"I am an avid reader of biracial romance novels. Ms.Kittgive you the ""411"" on interracial relationships. This is a goodread. I loved Leah. She had a lot of issues to deal with----a silly sister and a stupid boyfriend. Jason was a tough as nails type of guy. He had to battle with the loss of his son and with the stupid bigots on his job. Inspite of all Jason and Leah had to go through, love won in the end."
3,Views are outdated!,"I read the book because it was the ""book of the month"" for our book club. I found it to be pretty naiveté for this day and age. I'm sure interracial couples still go through some problems due to ignorance, but it just does not seem to be as big a deal as the book made it out to be. I know the book was written in 1995 but the thinking was more 1950ish.I am still trying to figure out the ""sisters"" relationship.Althea"
3,Good. Typical Warren Miller flick.,"I enjoyed this film. Although it would be better if there are less really close-up slow motion shots and more medium range shots so I can what the riders are doing and where they are going. Snowriders 2 have more up close scenes in slow motion than other Miller films I saw, and that is more distracting than anything. Imagine watching up close Pamela Anderson Lee runs in her bathing suit in slow motion for 90 minutes. After a while, it gets tiresome.It's an entertaining film, no doubt. If you're a snow enthusiasts it'll pump you up. The visual is stunning and the camera work excellent. But I can't help but wonder, do they really need to spice up the riding so much? Doesn't a skier charging down a 60 degree vertical is hair-raising enough by itself?"
5,Gut wrenching laughter on almost every poem,The funniest compilation of motherisms I've seen; I loved this book and recommend it highly
5,Hook me up with Harold!,"I had no idea what to expect, however the book was well written & had good details from a historical perspective. Before reading this, I had not really known of the story of Harold & Edith. It made me go on a ""google frenzy"" finding out all I could!Tragic ending, yet considering the time period, and knowing history... it came as no suprise!Delightful read... highly recommend this book!"
2,Hard for non-native speakers,Be advised that the language of the book is sort of archaic. I (as a non-native speaker) found it very hard to read.
5,My opinion on Harold the Last of the Saxon Kings,"I think the book was very well written. Most biographys are written promoting the subject as the hero of the piece, using selected source material to back them up. Here the author does neither. Harold is presented in a straight forward manner, and source material is presented that both backs up the English view of a hero as well as the Norman view of a lying oathbreaker. By the end of the book I was pulling for Harold to win!"
4,Harold the last of Saxon Kings,"It is a very long read, but kept my interest all the way thru. It is a story that keeps moving along all the time with never a dull moment. A true page turner. It is one I plan to read again in the future."
1,Difficult to digest,"I tried, I tried, I did. But I couldn't get past the dreadful archaic writing. Why the author wrote this in his version of old English I don't know. I didn't think they even spoke English in those days. I could not finish and don't think I could return to it. Shame. A good story not well told."
2,Not what I expected,"I started this book. Very old English sounding. I read over 2 chapters and just couldn't get into this book. As far as I got, I consider it boring. I may try it again, but for now ... it was no page turner!"
5,"Gray, At His Best","David Gray sold out, big time, period! A Century Ends is his debut album from 16 years ago, a release the proved that maximum intensity, angst and passion can be communicated with an acoustic guitar and a Welsh singer songwriter who really felt what he bellowed. Unlike more recent releases, these songs are well-crafted, unique and thoughtful. If you are a David Gray fan now, I URGE you to hear this album - simple, severe, passionate, personal - can a folk rock album really have more edge and intensity than an alternative / punk album? Yup. GENRES: Folk Rock, Mellow Rock, Contemporary Folk.BUY IF YOU LIKE: David Gray, Richard Shindell.MUST HEAR TRACKS: ""Shine,"" ""Debauchery,"" ""Living Room."""
5,Beautiful!!1,"This cd is briliace in my opinion,listen it more than once in record store.And you will be amazed by the Briliance of the songs of this album.This album is way diferent from White Ladder,far less ""produced"",raw and you can 'hear his accent much more.A recommend this album with 5 stars.Personal favourits of this album:-Shine-Living room-Leave me upstairs"
5,David 'SHINES',"Anyone who's heard 'White Ladder' or 'A New Day At Midnight' knows that David Gray is a GREAT singer/songwriter with heartfelt lyrics and not an ounce of pretense. He sings, writes and plays and we know that he's a smart, insightful, humble person. However, not as many people have heard 'A Century Ends' which is a shame because it's definitely Gray's best album. It's truly heartfelt. There isn't a bad track on the album -- it's really a strong, strong debut. It's one of my favorite albums of all time and no adult alternative/folk/acoustic fan can go on listening to music without picking this album up first. If you don't believe me, listen -- the album speaks for itself!"
4,An amazing debut,"David Gray's first album (thankfully rereleased due to popular demand) is as stunning as it is complex. Don't expect to turn this record on and let it become background music. This album grips you and holds you down for the entire ride through the tracks. My personal favorite on this album is ""Gathering Dust"" with lyrics that are as striking as they are beautiful. Whether you are a longtime David Gray fan or a new follower don't miss out on this opportunity to experience the magic of his first album."
5,Pull Chain Switch,"The exhaust fan in my bathroom comes on with the light. I hate having it draw cold air over me when I step out of the shower. I also would hate to take a shower in the dark. The ""Leviton 10097-8 Pull Chain Switch, Single Pole On-Off; 1A-125V T, 3A-125V, 1A-250V; With Two 6 Inch Black Leads 18 Awg Awm Tew 105C 600V, Stripped 1/2 Inch"" solved the problem. And Hey It came with a couple of wire nuts to accomplish the installation. Good on Leviton!"
1,Horrible - DO NOT BUY,I purchased this because it stated a long lasting shine. What a HUGE mistake. The only time I saw a shine was when it was wet and then it dried to a matte finish. Now I have to strip my floor because it is actual wax and now won't take any other product. Thank goodness I noticed the dull finish before I did more than my hallway. Down the drain with this junk.
1,EZ Shine?,"Instead of sending dead flowers, give your ex a can of this stuff. J & J is doing Canadian consumers a favor by withholding this product from the market. Hoping I was getting a worthy successor to the Johnson's Beautiflor my mother used, I ordered a bottle of this stuff from the States. It is easy to apply and dries to a brilliant shine. But here's the rub (ha ha). As soon as I shifted some furniture on it, it scuffed. Unlike paste wax or Beautiflor you can't buff it back up. The dog leaves scratch marks all over it. I am waiting for spring in order to remove the mess with mineral spirits (the solvent)."
3,Not 100%,"There was nothing wrong with the product. It was me. I wanted a liquid paste wax, but I was mistaken on the brand. However I received the product above mentioned in excellent time and it put a nice shine on my hardwood, but just was not the type cleaner I was use to. Therefore I only gave it a 3-star rating. M. N."
5,The Best Band I've Heard In A While,"This album and this band are truly amazing! I can't recomend Gatsby's highly enough. I've seen them live 3 times now and I keep coming back for more. This is the best ""punk"" has to offer, high proficiency musicianship, catchy songs, and pure passion. You MUST hear these guys! If you're into Coheed and Cambria or Thirce you'll love them, and if you're into New Found Glory or Sum 41, they'll convert you!!!!"
4,Disney Animation Collection 2: Three Little Pigs,"My not quite 3 year old granddaughter is into big bad wolfs and 3 little pigs right now so I purchased this for her when she comes to visit. I must admit it was a little more graphic then I remembered it, but no matter my granddaughter just can't get enough of it. This DVD includes the song ""who's afraid of the big bad wolf"". She also loves Little Red Riding Hood which is also covered on this DVD. I myself like the Lambert segment which is a much more pleasant story no big bad wolf until the very end. So if your child is into the above and won't be scared by the angry wolves they will just love this. By the way great picture quality.However for the more faint a heart there is always ""Dora and the Three Little Pigs"" too. I bought them both and they are both enjoyed."
3,dvd,Was okay for my three year old who loves the story. Old time for his liking but kept him occupied
3,This dvd went to market but the litho stayed in the vault,Okay the dvd may have come out to buy and your suppose to get a free litho with each dvd in the series but the my copy of the three little pigs did not. So the did went to market and the litho stayed in the vault. I did not get mine copy from amazon.However it is still a good movie to add to any disney collection. Many of the shorts are ones that have not been released before from disney's vault buit you have to wonder if this means that more previously unreleased shorts and or movies will be coimng in the furture.While it would have been nice if these shorts would have been digitally remastered they are still enjoyable to watch. If you like disney and classic animation i recomend these dvds. I am looking forward to getting the rest and hope that the will eventually come out on a dvd in remastered form.
4,Just what I wanted.,"I wasn't looking for the [...] box set of shorts so I was very happy with what I got. Classic Disney shorts that my 4 year old niece loves. I remember these from when I was little and they are as fun now as they were then. It doesn't say that they were ""remastered"" so I didn't expect or want a new looking shows. The sound was fine and the picture was fine so it is getting a 4 out of 5 from me."
3,big bad wolf on Amazon,"My grandsons just love this video they just love the old vintage cartoons, I thought it might have been easier to hear still a lot of the old static. Shipped out very fast."
3,It's Little Feat,"...this documents the continuing catalog of Little Feat material, at a point with Lowell George hadn't quite sunk into the depths of narcotic addiction and the rest of the band was coming into it's own musically. I chose this one rather than a re-mastered version, simply because, this is the one I remember. I have re-mastered releases that have been tampered with and some that are just cleaned up aurally (which is what I prefer) The sound quality on this isn't bad as some suggest and it was recorded up in Maryland -- another testament to the bands allegience with the D.C. area..."
2,Feats done failed me now,This CD was given a good review in Baggers magazine so I thought I would try it. Turns out to be a somewhat pale version of the Holmes Bros. sound. Not really bad just bland by comparison.
5,Classic Little Feat,"While perhaps not as well known as their other albums, ""Sailing Shoes"" and ""Dixie Chicken"", this disc offers more of the same Little Feat sound. Classics such as ""Rock and Roll Doctor"" and ""Oh Atlanta"" are probably quite familiar to diehard LF fans--I have a live recording that was made shortly after this album, and basically every song is on it. I love every track (except maybe ""Spanish Moon""--the only one that's not my favorite.) If you, like me, can't get enough of this band at their prime, then you'll have to get this album. Don't bother buying it track by track b/c you'll probably want all of them. The magic comes from Lowell George's guitar and vocals, combined with Bill Payne's piano, Richie Hayward's drums--the entire band rocks in their unique blend of LA-New Orleans rock-funk. Add to that the backup vocals of Emmy Lou Harris and Bonnie Raitt and you've got an unbeatable sound."
3,a second vote against the poor mastering,"I agree completely with the reviewer below who points out just how poorly this album was transfered to CD. The music itself is fine, featuring Little Feat in all their greasy glory, with interesting arrangements and deceptive playing that comes off so effortless that it sometimes hides what truly outstanding musicians they are. ""Skin It Back"" is just one of many that you can't help enjoy. However, it is almost hard to enjoy ANY of it on this extrmemly poorly mastered CD. This really harkens back to the days when albums were first being put on CD, and many known ""dogs"" were floating around, notorious for the exceptionally lousy transfer job--Fleetwood Mac ""Rumours"" being the most famous of these (""Yessongs"", also). Little Feat deserves remastering just on their merit and place in music history, but the desperate need for it to happen NOW stems from the horrible sound quality of this CD. The three stars is to balance great music with miserable sound quality."
5,tops,This album was the best put forth by Little Feat. Ever. Dixie Chicken comes in 2nd. Sailin Shoes comes in 3rd. (From someone who listened to this stuff when it first came out.) Buy them in that order.
3,Good book,I thought this was a good book but it would have been alot better if he would have told it in his own voice. He has a much better fluctuation and expressiion than the guy who read this one for the audio. But overall really good book.
1,Don't waste your money on this DVD release!!!,"The movie isn't half bad for a spaghetti western comedy, however the idea of East meets West was much better executed in Red Sun (1972) starring Charles Bronson & Toshiro Mifune. The one star rating is for the awful DVD transfer you are getting. The source material must have been a poor quality VHS copy complete with plenty of stretch marks (visible throughout movie),which in turn used a totally worn out 16 or 35mm print as its source. If you are a die hard Eli Wallach fan, and you want to see him in a fairly hard to find movie, then by all means, buy it. To everybody else,I recommend waiting for a better quality DVD release that will do this movie justice. Better yet, give ""Red Sun"" a try."
5,Foot-stomping groovy fun - clean your house twice as fast!,"Crank up the volume and then start cleaning the house. You will get done twice as fast and have fun. More fun than Don Braden ""Organic"", more hip than Joey DeFrancesco ""At the 5 Spot"", and possibly, just possibly groovier than the Essence All Stars ""Organic Grooves!"" One of my favorite CD's of all 1998."
4,The world's greatest banjo player,"When Harry Reser wasn't leading the two best hot white jazz bands of the 1920's, the Six Jumping Jacks and the Clicquot Club eskimos, he was making these incredible banjo recordings. Think of Harry Reser as the Les Paul of the 1920's. His fingers were the fastest in the world and his technique was jaw dropping. He seems to playing chords and picking at the same time or is he playing two banjos at once? This particular album will appeal more to guitarists and musicians than to those seeking twenties pop music. For those, grab the other Harry Reser albums on Amazon."
5,RAGTIME BANJO MUSIC,HARRY RESER WAS THE PRE-EMINENT BANJO PLAYER IN JAZZ IN THE 1920'S BEFORE THE GUITAR REPLACED THE BANJO. THESE ARE SMALL GROUP RECORDINGS MADE BETWEEN 1922-1930. THIS MAN HAS SO MUCH DEXTERITY AT TIMES IT SOUNDS AS IF THERE ARE TWO BANJOS BEING PLAYED SIMULTANEOUSLY. ALL OF THE RELEASES ON THE YAZOO LABEL ARE HIGH QUALITY AND CLEANED UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
1,very drab.,"The first thing that disappointed me about this book was that fact that the blurb on the back gives away what seems to be the only thing that would even come close to a plot twist. That has nothing to do with the acutal writing itself, but it was rather a spoiler.Then I started to actually read the book, which was worse. Frame uses 40-word setences when being 'descriptive'. She ends up to near rambling, and using almost hackneyed descriptions of what the characters do.Her whole idea is very intriguing, but she goes nowhere with it. The end of the book is in the blurb, and even if it was not, it would still be a very boring read. No empathy or connection was made with any of the charachters, false or not. They were stiff and dull."
4,Percolator for travel for family,"It's NOT for fancy home or special ocasion gathering, but it's good and handy travel Percolator for family. Simple and safe. Price very low, so if it brakes in a few months or in a year, I don't care - one visit to restoran costs me more. Works good so far - boils water and makes coffee. Sertanly worth the money."
1,leaky percolator,"This thing leaked bad the first time I used it !Really, I have never received such a low quality item...........I didn't bother to report the problem, as I knew it would be to much trouble to get a replacement.BUT I would like to have one.........."
1,Worked Great....for about two weeks!,"Up until yesterday, this was the best little coffee percolator ever! Then I went to make my coffee as usual and plugged it in...but no coffee! It didn't even heat up the water! Looks like you really do get what you pay for :-(I still like using a percolator as they make superior coffee but next time, I'll invest the $$$ for a good one!"
3,Elite EC902 Pecolator,"I bought this product in Jan. 2006. I had it for 3 days & when I went to serve me coffee. It was not working, so of course I went on line w/Amzon.com. Found out what I needed to return the item(by the way it was the BEST RETURN I have ever done) so. easy.No complications so I will highly recommended Amazon. com to all my friends. Oh , I received another one, & so far its been great.Susan"
1,Elite Cuisine EC902,"You get what you pay for, cheap is not always better. Using the product to heat water the percolator feature brews coffee about as good as cold water."
2,Elite Cuisine EC902 8 Cup Automatic Tea and coffee pot,This was too small for me. Only made about 2 big mugs of coffee at one time.
1,Not Really,the percolators i have experienced in the past was nothing like this one it has made my clean up more then ever before don't like it at all!
2,Decent,"While most certainly a descriptive look at the role of infantry in the 20th century(excluding late conflicts such as the Gulf War), the author focuses far too much on the singular role of infantry weapons and squad composition for success. He very lightly looks at the overall strategy of conflicts, so it is quite ironic that he focuses on the tactical brilliance of the Japanese and German troops during WWII, without realizing the sole purpose of warfare is to win wars. His chapters on the Japanese are probably the most troubling when he discusses their small unit abilities while failing to mention the inevitable devastation that their human wave tactics caused on their infantry units and war plan as a whole."
3,Had to make it work,"The bolts to mount the window to the regulator would not fit. They are the original factory bolts so I know they were not the issue. It appears as if the mount was stamped about an 1/8th of an inch to small. The extra clearance would have allowed the slight shift in the window that is needed to prevent it from binding during operation. So now my daughter can only roll the window down halfway before it starts to bind up. It will still go all the way down, but I told her not to do so to prevent damage to the regulator. Other then that it works fine."
1,Never again,"This product absolutely does NOT fit a 1997 Honda EX. Although Amazon part finder claims it does, it does not. I don't care if anyone comments and argues with me or not. The product DOES NOT fit the 1997 Honda EX that is sitting in my driveway. BEWARE!"
5,A note from the JYPU's record label,"The knock-down, drag-out debut full length from Oakland's mighty five piece. Three writhing guitars rolling all over the drums and bass with the most gripping vocals we've heard in a while. Lyrics convey subtle wit and brutally stark alienation with an earnestness currently out of vogue though no less potent for it. This album will leave you in a puddle made of either you or yours. Includes the barn-burner ""Breakdown Championship"" plus a re-recording of ""Monotonologue"" from the debut EP. - Absolutely Kosher Records"
3,mixed results for dimmer socket,"Actually, they (2) did not fit the lamps for which they were ordered, so I used them in different lamps. One has already failed, but I still had the original socket. The other one is working satisfactorily."
4,A book that will grab you in the first few pages,"The story of two, young and very accomplished violinists from two very different backgrounds. They meet in a music school in pre-war Vienna. As they mature, something sinister develops in one as it does in the country itself. The story begins with the auction (many years later) of a violin which was owned by one of them. The author tells his story around this violin which in the end reveals the connection between the two violinists. I found it a great Sunday afternoon read, next to a fire."
1,Schmaltz! Cliche! Gothic Potboiler!,"I cannot believe the slew of positive reviews this book has garnered! This book is a schmaltzy, badly-written, gothic potboiler, at best. Minimal literary merit. At least it's short. Characters were poorly developed, and the plot is predictably silly. This book would find its true audience more effectively were it to be covered in pink foil, with a picture of Fabio brandishing a violin!"
4,A finely woven tale,"This novel is a finely woven tale of two boys and their passion for mastering the art of the violin in and around Austria during pre- and post war times. Tied together by a very strange lineage of events, the author brings all mystery together in the last few pages that will keep you glued to the story and marveling at the cleverness of this novel."
3,A gripping story that leaves too many unanswered questions,"On the advice of a friend I bought this book. As I began reading, I was pleasantly surprised by the book's excellence. I am sorry that the author didn't maintain it to the very end.The mysterious circumstances of the story immediately caught my attention, demanding me to continue reading. In the middle of the book I feel that story begins to stray a bit from Jenö, the main character, and his passions and ambition. I found the end to be rather abrupt and one that answers far too little. The bits of information that the author offers do not add up, leaving the ending and the true fate of the characters open to much debate. I would have preferred a clearer ending.However, it is an excellent story and one that you will not be able to forget for a long time."
2,Disappointed,"These were bought with the Fiskars 98887097 No. 5 Softgrip Micro-Tip Craft Scissors for use in embroidery, with the intent to use it in situations where it was necessary to snip floss as close to the fabric as possible. It's performance has been haphazard as it tends to chew the thread rather than cutting it cleanly.This has been the only disappointment thus far with the Fiskars brand."
2,its ok if you dont need the dvd,"i bought this computer when it first came out. best Buy had a really good deal on it. The computer works like a charm and i love the amount of hard drive space. That being said it is not without its flaws, mainly the Dvd. I watched about 2 dvds burned a few movies and used the light scribe. about a week after purchasing I noticed the dvds I watched started skipping. also the burn speed was greatly reduced. I'm burning dvds at a stunning .5X and cds at a whopping 4x speed at max. Also playing games using the cd/dvd drive is severely slow. if you need a computer with lots of memory its good, but if you need a light scribe, dvd player/burner, or a cd burner think again."
1,HP Sucks,"HP has the WORST customer service of any company of any kind that I have ever dealt with. I have never called without having spent at least one hour on the phone with them before the various extensions in India, none of whom are helpful. And once the service is complete the computer is usually returned with more problems than they were originally sent with. I would never buy another HP again"
4,"Good, but..",It has been many years since I read this and I guess the boquets that are so generously thrown at Aasimov don't seem quite as wonderful as they used to.
5,Not bad at all!,"Most people usually give a nice, scientific analysis of the CD in this section but to be honest I think in The Music's case, this is simply not needed! All of the songs are awesome and you can't help but lose yourself in The Music's music, and before long you find yourself jumping around the room out of control.For me the best songs on the album are, ""Turn out the light"" (A wonderfully mellow tune) and, ""Getaway"" (Just awesome!)Buy this album!"
2,~Classic Disappointment~,"I would like to make a couple of things clear before I begin my review.1.) This review is for 'Mickey and The Beanstalk' Disney animated short only.2.) I bought this at Target not Amazon.comI've had for a really long time wanted to buy 'Mickey and The Beanstalk' ever since the VHS tape I had of it was lost in one of my many moves.So when 'Disney Animation Collection 1: Mickey & the Beanstalk' was released I was ecstatic and bought it for a premium price of $20.The packaging and title screens are pristine in quality and sound however 'Mickey and The Beanstalk' is not, the animation looks like it hasn't been cleaned up in decades, even the VHS Version was better, the sound is horrific with the music and sounds and sound effects being really loud while the speech is very soft.I agree with other previous posters to rent before buying because as much of a classic as this is it's not worth $20 and it's probably not worth watching more than twice in a decade."
2,Mickey & the Beanstalk,"When I purchased this new DVD release, I was expecting the original version I had seen when I was growing up. HA!! What a disappointment!This version is so heavily edited, and with useless narration by Ludwig Von Drake, that it was hard to watch and enjoy. And when I wrote to the Disney Studio about this version, I was told I was mistaken and that this is the only ""true"" version. Again, what a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!"
5,"Great condition, good quality shows","These were among my kids' favorites when they were little. Now we have them on DVD for their kids. A corner of the case was broken out, but the disk works fine."
5,"Turkey, Lobster, Sweet potato pie!","I LOVE this cartoon. My brother, sister and I memorized this cute cartoon. In fact, I still have the ""Eat until I die"" song in my head (I'm 31--good grief, that went fast!) I've been looking for this video on and off for years now and am excited that it will be released this April."
5,Mickey & The Beanstock,"This was a great movie. Had it years ago and lost it, so was thrilled to have it come out again."
2,Mickey Mouse never got much respect...and that includes from me,"The first of 3 volumes of Disney animation contains Mickey starring in a retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk along with four other shorts. Disney is the king of feature-length animation and won all the Oscars in sight for many years when it came to shorts, but they're remembered far less fondly than Merrie Melodies, Bugs Bunny, the Fleischer work and just about any other artist creating shorts. It's not wholly fair -- despite being far less anarchic, they're solid works, albeit a bit staid. It's the difference between the original Grimm fairy tales and the sanitized versions with all the scary and sexy bits taken out. Volume 2 has seven shorts, including Three Little Pigs and Volume 3 has Mickey in The Prince and the Pauper, along with four other shorts."
4,Tough call for readers,"It's very hard to figure out who this book is for and when they should be reading it. What I mean is, the writing, humor, and storyline is for a more advanced reader, but the vaguely arch teddy-bear character and treatment is for a younger kid. So the ones who might most like it could have trouble reading it and the ones who can read it might very well find it too childish. So far that's been our experience, at least, with our readers.That said, the book is a good read-to. Some of the humor is over the little ones' heads, but the charm of the character and of the situations he encounters comes through clearly and seems to satisfy. I don't think this is a library essential, but it certainly is a fun option to have available when the mood strikes."
5,GREAT book!,"I loved this book; it shows a girl of great courage coping with grief. Even though it is sad in parts, it is about healing and is immensely positive. I highly recommend it."
3,This is from the back of the soft cover book!!!!,"The swallows are here again. They have come south looking for summer. Did they fly over my country? Did they see my mum amd dad? Did they see my little yellow canary?Nam-Huong cries lots of onion tears...It's only when she laens to smile inside, andd finally laugh, that her tears fall like drops of dew."
5,Great CD,"Johnny permenently gave up singing pop when he went in the army in 1964, but he's still going strong in the music business today performing 20's and 30's big band era music with his own 16 piece orchastra and the crowds love him as much as ever. http://www.johnnycrawford.com"
5,Good Stuff,"I don't know about the USA, but here in Canada, we do not hear enough Johnny Crawford on the oldies stations. His voice and the types of songs he recorded in the 60s are part of a style of music that really made people feel good. I recommend this CD both for the great music and the memories it will bring to all those folks who grew up watching Johnny on TV and listening to him on the radio... It is five stars all the way.Mike Shaw"
3,Today is Johnny's birthday.,"Back in 1961, Johnny Crawford appeared on the TV showThe Rifleman, playing the son of Chuck Conners. He was a good looking kid who was popular with girls, so LA based independent record label Del-Fi decided to turn him into a singing teen idol. Fortunately, it turned out that he had a pleasant light tenor voice. He went on to become the most successful recording artist that Del-Fi had. He placed eight singles on the Hot 100, including one Top 10 and two Top 20s. His records were all of the teenage pop variety, mostly ballads that didn't rock too hard. Most of them are pretty enjoyable. The first eight songs on this CD are his eight chart singles, in order of how big a hit they were. Then there are 16 other songs, which consist of b-sides, album tracks and flop singles. This is more Johnny Crawford than most people will want to listen to, but it's better too have too many songs than not enough songs."
2,history,"My mistake I'm sure, but I thought this would be acrobatic perfomances. It is actually a cultural history lesson. There are no complete performances shown, only snippets. There are subtitles avaible."
5,Great Deal for a Great Game,"The price on this game was amazing.... I was very surprised at the condiion of this ""used"" product. Being a board game, with paper componenets, I was shocked that nothing was torn, ripped, or frayed. I will be buying more from this vendor again."
2,..,"I didn't like this book that nuch, and I was a bit disappointed because I thought it could've been better that what it turned out to be."
3,So Little Brain!,"Identical twin,Chloe Carson,is in love with a boy who is constantly in detention and tries her best to come up with heaps of plans to get herself detention too,to be with him. Meanwhile, the other half of the twin faction,Riley Carson,is in love with one boy while being stuck with a total geek!!I recommend buying this series if you have been a Sweet Valley fan."
1,Best to ignore this one!,I remember watching this and the feeling of disappointment I had at the end. This does not live up to the Omen Trilogy! While watching it I actually became somewhat bored and considered stopping the tape and doing something else. In 50 years I doubt if anyone will remember this flick.
2,Don't waste your time....,"I saw this movie right after watching the original Omen. At the time, I thought it was a decent movie, but after seeing Omen II and III, I realize that it did not live up to its predecessors at all! It made absolutely no sense, but it did make you jump occassionally. If you really want a scare, get the original trilogy."
1,A pure crap,"This movie is a blasfemy indeed. I gave one star because I had no more options below it. Why was it called ""The Omen"" anyway? It made no sense at all. It's a horrible movie that had nothing to do with the original trilogy. This movie sucks. Avoid it at all cost if you really liked the original trilogy.BTW... It's hard to decide which one will suck more. The Awakening or the trilogy remake."
2,The Omen 4,Anyfan of The Omen who has faithfully watched the first three and not seen this one should stop right now so you'll continue to have great memories from the frightfest called the Omen. The Omen 4 (1992) is the worst sequel in the history of horror film sequels and I'm including the worst of the Halloween and Friday the 13th sequels.The Omen 4 is about Damien's spawn and the next coming of the antichrist. The problem is the Damien's child who is set to be the next antichrist is a girl. The explanation of how a girl is the next antichrist doesn't work not to mention that she's an annoying spoiled brat. The original omen worked because you weren't sure what to believe about Damien since he was likable. Delia is not likable and the story is lame.
1,Omen Iv-The Awakening.,"Or The Sleepiness? Dullness? what scare was there here? I though Omen III had hit rock bottom? I was wrong! This movie is just as awful. the only good in the series are Parts 1 and Part 2(not as much as Part 1). This movie is almost a comedy, zany music,(clown type music?) Bad Actors/Acting,bad story,bad all around."
1,"The Omen, without Damien?","I am a huge fan of The Omen series but The Omen without Damien should not have been made. Generally when the main character is killed off that means that the series is complete, when they try to start up the series with a new main character that almost always means failure, and in this movie that is exactly what happened. I've heard that they made an Omen 5 but I think it's just a rumor, is this true?"
2,Rubbish,"This is not Omen, this is just a cheap copy of it. Death scenes nearly the same with other Omens but this time they are too weak and not impressive. Also that black dog from the first episode appears suddenly and becomes a member of family which I find very unnecessary. Apparently Delia is luckier than her own father because Damien was 12 when he realized who he was indeed but Delia awares of herself since she was born. Maybe females of the Devil's family are more clever :)))) We hear less music in this movie therefore the important scenes turns out to be ordinary especially for the viewers who has seen the Real Omens . To sum up I can say that there had been no reason to make this movie, so you don't have any to see it. the previos Omens."
1,"What a silly, silly thing to do.","I thought The Omen and it's sequels were part of a trilogy? Well I was wrong. Omen 4, originally made for tv was released in 1991. This time the seed of Damien is apparent in a child, Delia who seems to appear as the demon child in this sequel. The death scenes are silly, the producers obviously trying to entertain the horror crowds with gore so they won't notice the thin plot of this film. Of course one thing is saved from this movie being a total flop, Jerry Goldsmith returns with his original movie score to give the film some credibility although it doesn't deserve any whatsoever. Pathetic sequel, made to squeeze every last drop of blood the other films every had."
2,The beast will come. . .,"Damien Thorn is dead, but his legacy lives on in a little girl. Delia York seems like your average child yet the strange deaths happen wherever she goes. Her mother starts to question about what their adoptive child really is.Another sequel in The Omen films. . . You are lead to believe that Delia is the Anti-Christ, but there's a small plot twist to shock you. Not at good as the movies before. It's almost like when Halloween 3 was made without Michael Myers, The Omen 4 isn't as good without Damien Thorn."
5,HAIL DELIA,I like this movie a lot. I like it a lot because of the Girl DELIA. I have always liked movies that have Evil Chrildren in it. DELIA I am on your side. HAIL SATAN HAIL DELIA.
4,"Good, But Limited Audience Only","This was an amazing book. You have to read the other books before it though, Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Spring Dawning. You find out about a lot of vital information. There is a lot of action. It is awesome."
2,Disappointment,"After the several books that I have read involving Dragonlance, I expected more of this seminal series. I had hope. The second book had some potential. This book dashed those hopes, and squandered that potential. The characters are entirely too transparent. If I have to hear one more time how kenders never feel fear, but in that instance Tasselhoff felt something that equates to fear, I swear I'm going to scream. Raistlin is so ambitious for power that he has to constantly remind everyone, including the reader, of this, and oh yeah, by the way, he's Fistandantilus. What? Could that have come from any farther out in left field?This series is a poor example of Fantasy writing. The only reason that this book rates two stars is that it may serve as a whirlwind introduction to the world of Dragonlance. However, a book of short stories could have served that purpose better.All in all a disappointment."
5,A Great end to a great triology,"Books you should have already read : Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night.The companions are separated and even though they won an important battle against the evil armies of the Dark Queen, have silver, gold and brass dragons to help them and have mastered the art of using dragonorbs and dragonlances, the final battle has to be fought hand to hand(sometimes literally!).The end is not as predictable as it sounds. Friends will die or worse, turn enemies!Who will rule Krynn in the end is not obvious.So my dear friends, read on. Take a plunge in this high adrenaline finale to the triology that keeps you on the edge and makes you a part of the victories and defeats of the valiant warriors fighting to save Krynn from eternal darkness."
5,The balance is restored!,"A perfect conclusion to a perfect trilogy! The ending is why I love the Dragonlance novels. The bad guys didn't win but the good guys didn't either. The balance was restored. Nothing more, nothing less.The ending with Raistlin is great. I love him but he gives me the creeps."
4,well...,"You gotta admit the book was pretty good. I could see worse endings to the trilogy. However, most of the characters were pretty much ruined by the 2nd part. I just can't imagin Tanis like that! The only two chars to successfully live through the book was Raistlin and Laurana. The mage proved to be truly fascinating. Laurana (my favorite char) finally proved her courage and strength. Two stars goes to each of these two chars. As for the rest... *sigh* well, at least Flint was killed before he could suffer any of the changes."
4,Nice conclusion,"Though the whole series seemed a bit cliché to me (too much of the good vs. evil thing), it was still excellent. I read it real fast, which is a good sign. I don't see what's wrong with what happens to Tanis: it's quite dramatic and it's good to see characters have their flaws. Raistlin rules, as always. Can't wait to try the Legends trilogy..."
4,"Good, but not great","The Spring Dawning is not quite as good as the other two books in the chronicles. It is a good book, but in the beginning it is boring. It doesn't live up to the other two. But if you read them, I reccommend reading this."
4,No Suprises,Once again Hickman and Weis come through with flying colors!Each volume seems to flow seemlessly into the next. I can hardly wait to read the next adventure.
4,An incredible novel to conclude an incredible trilogy.,"Most trilogies give out a great first chapter, a half-hearted second installment, and conclude on a glittery finale, with lots of style and no substance. This is not an example of that - this is an excellent work that can only be fully appreciated by reading the novels that preceeded it. Excellent writing by Weis and Hickman make this book a real winner. There are a few spots that could've been better - an ending that is pretty much a plug for the next series of books, and the rushed write-out of two characters is disappointing to say the least. But there's a lot to like in this book, and that's enough to make it a must-have for any reader."
4,"Not as good as the others, but definately a must-get.","The last book in the series, DoSD ties the whole thing together. Unfortunately, it doesn't tell you what happens to Kitiara. I know that they are probably letting you make your won conclusions, but still, they should give a hint. Well, I guess it was all right."
5,Excellent ending to the trilogy,"This is one of my favorite series written by M.W. & T.H. Well written and full of adventure, villainy and romance."
3,Just okay,"This is the comic adaption of the third part of the Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy, first published in 1984. Unlike the first two adaptions, this one was split up into two parts, and this is the second part.Unfortunately this graphic-novel was drawn by people with only average artistic talent.Nevertheless the story adaption is as excellent as before and everybody who owns the previous 3 books of this adaption will want to have the final one."
5,The eternal balance,"The most interesting aspect of this book isn't the fact that good triumps, but simply, that good matches evil. It poses the intriuqing question of which is better, eternal good or an eternal balance between good and evil? The characterisation is incredible, the build up of the previous two, climaxes in this as all character reaches their full potential."
4,Pretty good,I liked it but you have to read the series to really enjoy it. I have enjoyed the series verymuch
5,This is an amazing work of art!!,"I read this book last year,in 5th grade. I DID NOT put it down. I found that I had no truble with the wording, but the story kept me on the edge of my seat. So far, I have read about 6 of these books, and loved them all!!!!"
1,None,Horiffic book. Tough to believe that Weis and Hickman were not trying to write some filthy heap of romantic trash. I have never before seen a book so badly written. A 4-year old could not have written worse trash. They should have stopped at book 1.
5,"Five Stars only if you have read the first 2, otherwise 0","I almost think there is no need to write a review of this book:You either didn't like the simplistic characterization and poor writing of the first two, or you enjoyed the first enough to read the second. If you have read the first two you HAVE to read the third. Think about all the time you will have wasted only reading the first 3! Furthermore, for those still reading, you can look forward to a good ending. Some series (most notably Douglas Adam's) end very disappointingly, but this is not true of Dragons of Spring Dawning. The War of the Lance is brought to a satisfying end.I further recommend the ""Legends"" saga. It is overall better and is a natural next step in the saga."
5,Second Peak Album,"""Hard Promises,"" in my opinion, refers to the tough task TP&HBs had in following the greatness (artistic and commercial) of ""Damn The Torpedoes."" They completely made good on that ""promise"" with this record. I personally like ""Hard"" more than ""Damn,"" which may only be because it received slightly less overkill/exposure when it was released. Both are absolutely outstanding. Back in the day when bands were allowed (by their record companies) to develop their sound over the course of a few albums, greatness was often born. That is the case here. ""Damn"" marked the beginning of their peak creativity, and ""Hard"" found them calmly enjoying the view from the top. Most bands quickly slide downhill after they peak, but TP&HBs mananged to remain there for this album and then slowly (very slowly) ""descended."" Over the years they've managed to hit other career peaks as well but never as naturally and confidently as on ""Hard Promises."""
4,"HIS BEST ALBUM, NEVER EQUALLED ..","THis is TOm Petty and his band at their best. This album was never equalled. THe only weak point are the drums, really annoying, flat sound. The rest is close to perfection (well, if you like pop anyway...). Congratulations. This album was released in 1981."
3,Hard Promises (1981),"While two years came between Damn the Torpedoes and Hard Promises, Hard Promises tends to be the weakest entry in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers catalog so far. There are classic Petty tunes here like The Waiting and Insider, but much of the filler is weaker than it had been on previous albums. Songs like Nightwatchman tend to be rather goofy to me. Hard Promises is still a worthwhile edition to your Tom Petty collection, but it is just not as good as the albums that came before it."
4,hard promises,great album great songs great beat great vocals great to hear early tom the band sounds tight if you like tom petty you will like this album
4,Tom Petty Hard Promises,"I recently saw Tom perform in Little Rock AR, and he put on a great show, he performed the song ""Something Big"" I'd never heard the song before and was blown away, I purchases ""Hard Promises"" because it contained that song and impressed by the other songs including, ""Nightwatchman"", ""The Waiting"" ""The Criminal Kind"" and ""Letting you go"" this is a solid rock album that you enjoy for yearsRazorbackfan"
4,Hard Promises,"'Hard Promises' is one of Pettys most underrated albums. It is often overlooked in favour of his earlier work or his mega successful later output, but this album has it's own sound and some great tracks. 'Waiting' is one of the most well known from this album and it really is an amazing track, but tracks like 'Woman in Love (it's not me)' are just as powerful and the lyrics of this particular track are just awesome. The Stevie Nicks duet 'Insider' is a brilliant listen and sits perfectly in the middle of this album. This isn't always the first album I go to when I want a hit of Petty, but at the right time and place it is just superb to put on and soak up. Worth a listen, not essential Petty, but definitely one to add to your collection as you're finding those last gems.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,"Better than ""Torpedoes"" and arguably his very best","Petty's writing on classic songs like ""Insider"" and ""The Waiting"" is surely on a par with Dylan, and may even surpass that. This is such an emotional, hellbent, crazy-sad rock and roll record, filled with little twisted masterpieces. Petty topped his previous albums with ""Hard Promises"" and never quite equalled it afterward. That's OK. Any artist who hits a peak like this can be forgiven for ""Into The Great Wide Open""..."
4,A very good resource reference,Bought this sometime ago however provided very good reference material and was most worthwhile to the studies I was then doing and have subsequently completed. Written clearly and quite easily understood.
4,Les Boreades,"A must-have for Rameau freaks, Les Boreades is a fully staged production, with many incidental ballets and fabulous music by France's greatest Rococo composer. The choreography is amazing...modern ballet, and yet perfectly appropriate to the wildly ornate music. The seasonal theme here is handled nicely. Bonney is the strongest vocalist here. Agnew has that reedy French baroque tenor sound but little force and no ping. But who else would sing these roles? Alagna? Rivenq is great.My only criticism concerns the dramatic direction. Typical camp mugging creeps in to modern baroque opera productions all the time, because no one knows what to do with all the music or the plot except to render it modern by making it funny. It gets boring. Maybe everyone should just do less. The music isn't boring. And the musical direction is the best there is.Most excellent direction of a baroque opera I ever saw was Steven Wadsworth's handling of Xerxes by Handel at City Opera."
1,Make it stop...pleeease!,"If you like ultra modern productions coupled with 270 year old music then you will love this DVD. Personally I'm not such a good reviewer on the music of this DVD. Because of the inappropriate staging of this production, I could only stand to watch the first couple arias before hitting the ""power"" button on my DVD player.One thing I don't AT ALL understand is why you have an ensemble of musicians dedicated to historically informed performances and then couple it with a staging reminicent of the SNL ""Sprockets"" sketch from the 1980's!!! Buy a CD and listen to the music only, if you're like me you'll be much happier. What's with the French detroying their own culture anyway? Les Indes Gallantes is 100% better in all respects."
3,Overpriced,"I have waited years to acquire this book. No local library carried it, and you only get a couple of pages to browse through online. I finally purchased this book used. Thank goodness for that - although it is enjoyable and a nice book, the quality of the paper, and number of colored photographs do not merit a publishers' price of $50! I would price it at maybe $30 to start. Find a used copy!"
1,I'm puzzled,"What does this book have to do with Don Leevers and Lindsay Megarrity? The editorial on this book refers to a book written by Stephanie Donaldson who chronicles the efforts of these two folks who, literally, ""start from scratch"" in a garden in Tuscany, and produce a masterpiece of knot gardening. ""The real content of this book is the story of Don and Lindsay's determination to achieve the dream to which they aspired."" is the quote from the editorial review and then it goes on into a history of knot gardens and how to create your own by Robin Whalley and Anne Jennings. I truly thot I was buying a book relating the experiences of Don Leevers and Lindsay Megarrity, especially when the editorial referred to the book being written by Stephanie Donaldson and even relating that there were actual photos that were taken showing the progress made. Am I the only one fooled by what I thot I bought?"
2,Minor amusement for horror fans,"Classic Horror Trailers is nothing more than the original trailers of old movies (mostly horror) strung together. No bumper titles, no production value at all. Sometimes it wasn't clear if the movie title on the screen was for the previous movie or the next.Another disappointment was that no classic horror movies are found here. It's unfortunate that the Karloff/Strange image of Frankenstein is used for this title when none of their movies are included. The closest thing to classic are some of the original Hammer films.One trailer was run twice and several non-horror titles are included like High Plains Drifter, Flower Drum Song, and Marine. This title is simply an unedited collection of public domain trailers (in public domain condition) strung together. As such, it's fairly amusing, but it begs the question why didn't they put a little effort into it and make something really worth viewing."
5,Perfect for a Halloween party!,Run this on the tube with the sound off...campy perfection! I typical run old classics like the original Dracula or Frankenstein but this is compilation is exactly what I was looking for.
4,Good condition.. Took a long time to receive book.,"It took a long time, however when I emailed the company to ask the status of my order, they replied quickly!"
3,childrens books,"I don't remember this purchase, have not read the book, think it was donated to a school library from their wishlist, service ok"
3,sad story,"I've just finished reading this book. It says that it is a composite of different children that the author has worked with and not an actual child although it reads as if it was one child, 'Sheila'. The little six year old has a horrible life and then is badly abused by an uncle. If this was a true account it would be wrong for a teacher to be pushing a disturbed child to learn. Her emotional well-being should be taken care of first. In England social workers would remove her from her highly inadequate home. I recommend the books by Virginia Axeline."
3,One Child,"I would recon\mmend teachers to read One Child. The book gives a real insight to how a special needs classroom operates. The author does not try to cover up the negative aspects. Howver, the author deals withthe negatie situations in a very positive and uplifting manner. After reading the book, teachers would be motivated to deal with and handle any uncomfortable situations that arise in their class. I think this book helps teachers see the good and the bad parts of a class in an inspirational way. I strongly belive that all teachers can learn or gain something by reading this book. This book, in a sense, is a recipe for teachers to follow on how to care formstudents with special needs. This book would be for personal use and not for use in a classroom."
5,One of the Best Books Ever Written,"I agree with all the favorable reviews.One reviewer wanted to know about the movie. The movie stinks and does a disservice to the book. Sheila is called ""Caitlin Eldrige"" with an IQ of 168 in the movie. It is a poor, pale ersatz version of the book and isn't even worth watching. Torey is portrayed as a martyr. The movie is really bad and poorly done. Forget the movie.The book is first rate and nothing can take away from this amazing teacher's talent, courage and perseverance. Stick with the book instead."
