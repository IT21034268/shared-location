2,saddie-waddie,"This volume has received mostly favorable reviews and has been promoted as an excellent guide to the 90s art scene in New York. Unfortunately, the neurotic fixation of the author on graphic sex detracts from any appreciation of the ""art scene"". The organization of the book, especially the 3-5 line interspersed episodes, are distracting. It would have been better to have had 4-5 short stories, than snippets interwoven, so that keeping track of all the characters (with similar fixations on sex, rather than art)might be more easily accomplished. Gives the tone of NCY 90s art scene- but not the substance."
1,Not ideal for adults,"If your an adult looking to buy this raft for yourself or another adult don't waste your time and money. This product should be advertised as a toy, although it's rated to hold 200 pounds dont get the wrong idea. The vessel is hard to keep from folding and taking water on board the trick is to displace your center wieght almost like your lying down, this will keep the boat a float but it's really hard to paddle in that position. As a boat being tugged or lazy floats about it could be beneficial somewhat or for a pool toy for kids you can again somewhat get your money's worth out of it.One more thing; to inflate this raft takes a good bit of time, the pumps works but not that efficiently and furthermore it will take you longer to deflate the toy than it did to inflate."
3,Disappointed it's not really a 2 person boat,"I purchased this boat according to what it said, 2 person boat, but should of paid more attention to what other reviews were saying. It definitely is onlyfor one person unless you consider two toddlers would fit. The boat is very 'front' heavy so basically you cant sit in it the way you would expect to, you haveto sit backwards and row. I wanted it for fun at the lake for my 3 teen grandsons and sorry to say not one used it as it's too small and rather 'awkward'."
5,Great Fun!!!!,This toy is wonderful! I play in it for HOURS at the pool! Sometimes I tip it upside-down and I go under it! It's great fun! I highly recommend it!
2,"Fun, but quality questionable","These boats are nice way to float with minimal packing space. But as soon as we inflated both boats each one had a hole already in it (one in the sidewall along a crease from folding, one in the floor panel)."
5,Had it over a year and it's still GREAT,"We use this at the beach, in the Gulf of Mexico. My daughters LOVE to get in this little boat and fight the waves ~ where we live, there is a ""shelf"" that keeps the depth of the water at about 3 feet for maybe 200-300 yards. I've had up to six little (13, 14, 15 & 16 year old's) flopping in and playing rough in this little boat. Ideally it's for 2 passengers and then it's very comfortable. Three, still not a problem. I don't recommend more than that, but as I stated, the boat has held up. The paddles are great and come with the boat. It's too much boat to blow up, but an air pump makes short and easy work of that.If you're going to use this in saltwater, I highly recommend washing it after each use and not storing on the sand when not in use. It works equally great in the rivers."
2,"Made For Small Kids , Not Teens",i took this to a lake camping trip with friends hoping we could float around the lake . I was too heavy and even under the weight limit .if your buying this for your kids then i could see this being fun .
3,It is a pool toy and that's about it.,"This boat is for pool use only. It did not hold up during a 4 hour, 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water. By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy. However, if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
3,Had some fun,"ok so I bought the boat near the end of july and left a super positive review. By a few weeks ago it had a hole and deflated completely. I weigh 120 lbs while my brother was 215 lbs. Maybe that was the problem. I still recommend buying this boat though, cuz i bet i just got a bad one."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Only an idiot would buy this. A boat is a device meant to carry people across water without sinking or getting wet. There's an old expression, ""you get what you pay for"". Oars cost about fifteen bucks. High quality PVC glue costs about fifteen bucks. Do the math.If you own a swimming pool and know how to swim and love to waste money on garbage you dont need, then donate this money to people that do need it.Seriously, dont buy CHICOM garbage like this when you ALREADY know it's going to fail. No seriously... If I was up at a lake and handed this out to six children to play with, it would last about eight minutes and we all know it."
3,Pool Toy,We had one of these when my son was little...it held up for a whole summer tubing down the creek before it got a hole in it. Purchased one just recently for my daughter to use the same way. It got a whole in it the first trip down the creek. I don't think they are made as well as they used to be. This would be a great toy for the pool but isn't so great for our use.
3,It's OK,Purchased this for my daughter's birthday so we could use it on the lake. It doesn't stay inflated very well. Not that we sank but it did need to be blown up while we were out in it. Fun for the price just don't expect too much! :)
3,Intex Explorer 200,Don't plan on long usage as we have had to fill with air daily. Fun for kids in a pool. Would not use in any other situation like at the beach or any water that may get rough.
4,Seems great,Hours of fun for our kids. Just what we were looking for to let them explore more at the lake.
4,RiverRaft,"This is a great two seater raft for the money. We were on a family vacation and used it with our grandchildren on a slow moving river, no problems, no leaks and it made for a lot of fun what with the other tubes we had along for the adults, tied them all together and just drifted along."
3,Worked well with kids riding breakers at beach,"I bought this boat for my grandson to use at the beach. The ocean was rough, but my granddaughter and two of her cousins rode in the boat at the same time and had an absolute blast riding breakers in to the beach. The bottom inflates separately, so don't forget to inflate it as well. The only thing I really did not like is the inflation valve. It is one of those valves that comes on any cheap float or tube you buy at the beach. The Intex River Run tube I bought for my granddaughter had a heavy duty inflation valve that you could unscrew and it would deflate instantly. The valve on this boat (also an Intex product) you must squeeze together to let air out and it took a long, long time to deflate. If this boat had the same valve that comes on the River Rub tube I would give it 5 stars."
4,cheap,"you get what you pay for here. single chamber, thin plastic, and a small valve. consider it a pool toy and not a lake toy."
5,Excellent Expert Advice!,"One of the best compilations of expert advice ever assembled into ready-to-use instructions! Veterinarians cover ""How to Introduce Dogs and Cats"" while psychologists give tips on ""How to Be a Better Listener"" and financial advisors guide readers on ""How to Calculate Your Net Worth"" and much more. This book is published by Simon & Schuster as part of its reference category--a great addition to their stellar line up. Editor-in-Chief of the book is the 30+ year how-to editorial veteran Bill Marken, former Editor-in-Chief of Sunset Magazine and author of multiple books, including Gardening for Dummies. Hats off to Marken and his team of 150+ experts for creating an enduring 600+ page reference guide which is sure to become a classic. Great idea, great expertise, great guide! Thank you!"
1,Penetrating Glimpses of the Obvious,"640 Pages of web site clippings. I found little useful information and was offended by the tone of many of the ""How 2s"". Too broad of coverage very little depth."
1,How to Do Just About Everything (but run a business),"Not at all very helpful. The advice is too high level and not detailed enough. It would be better if the book was peppered with more valuable advice from well established and renowned advisors.Stay away from the business advice section. If eHow couldn't even succeed as a business, then you're better off not heeding its tips."
1,Are you kidding!,"I recieved this book as a gift. I guess the person who gave it to me must really think I am stupid. Save your money, this book is childish in its approach to solving obvious simple tasks. Not one ounce of how-to in it."
2,Cleaning cone...,I did not like this cone as it was too large for what I wanted to use it for and the instructions and the product labeling was wrong on the size.
1,Piece of garbage,"I bought this game in anticipation of a great product. My last computer chessboard lasted 10 years. This one....about three weeks, or maybe 20 games.Then the G and H rank squares would no longer operate. I changed batteries and did the ACL reset to no effect. G and H were dead.This is a loser when it comes to quality, don't buy this garbage."
1,Arrived defective,"The chess computer arrived defective - squares in columns ""d"" and ""h"" would not respond to presses, rendering it unusable. On the plus side, the amazon refund process went smoothly. And I guess there's a life lesson somewhere in disappointing a child who is excited about a gift only to find out it doesn't work. So I suppose that if those are the things you're looking for, then this chess set is for you!"
3,What is true and what is not,"I think the previous reviews for this item are a little mistaken. This second album is much inferior compared to the first one. Main point: J. Gioeli lost his voice! What happened to that wonderful voice I heard in the first record?! The guy sounds like if he had a flu! What happened, Gioeli, you didn't practice in the past ten years?? The new guitarist is ok, but Neal Schon is way too superior. And the songs are a little different from the old days. The best songs are ""Hold Me Down"" and ""Face the Night"", which remind of the band original style. ""Face the Night"" sounds like ""Can't Find My Way"", but is inferior, 'cause Gioeli can't sing anymore! Well, if you have never listened to the ""Double Eclipse"" album, ""II"" is a good album by itself. If you have listened to their debut, ""II"" is a major disappointment. The fact is that ""Double Eclipse"" remains as a single and unique masterpiece."
1,BORING!!!!,"Any of these reviewers that think this release is even close to the first release have got to be stoned. Hardline II is the reason that there is no more Hardline.The first Hardline release absolutly SMOKED! There was not a bad song on it. An absolute rock classic! Hardline II is loaded with sappy, overproduced, re-hashed licks. And Gioli's voice is shot.Plus the ""new"" guitarist can't even come close to carrying Niel Schon's gig bag!Don't waste your time here...."
5,One of my all time favorite authors,"Every Winton book I read, I love. These early stories are as captivating as the more recent. Highly recommended."
1,Terrible waste of time. Don't watch this,"Who are these people who write reviews claiming this is a brilliant worth-while movie?It is not, by any means, worth watching. It is a 90-minute movie that drags on and onand tortures the viewer for 2 hours and 36 minutes.Loooong drawn-out lingering shots indicative of a very poor director.Boring segments. Lack of much emotion. Random pornographic scenes.There really isn't any way to figure out who would write this, make such a film, fund such a film.I wish I could get my money back from Amazon. I wish I could rate it zero stars.PLEASE do not watch this film and waste precious moments of your time."
3,Too Long for My Taste,"A much too long dramatic panorama of French prison life with vivid scenes of ethnic conflict, violence and psychological depravity. Difficult to watch at times. In essence, we are confronted with the pain of incarceration, albeit with some superlative and convincing acting There is also a promise of personal redemption that basically saves the film. The amount of time expended on various deceits and intrigues, however, comes acros as excessive and there is some confusion in plot perhaps due to the subtitles. My overall impression is a 3-star movie viewing experience."
3,The education of a petty criminal.,"Very well made and well acted movie which chronicles, step by step, a petty crook's education and growth in a French prison."
2,I couldn't get into it.,Not sure if I was tired or just too much story but it sure made me sleep good and sound.
4,Well-Done,"in general, i don't like films with a lot of violence, but this one has a lot more in it that makes it worth-while.why do people post reviews that are like doctoral dissertations? and i think retelling so much of the plot sometimes verges on ""spoiling"" the film."
3,Struggled to give it 3 stars.,"A Prophet is completely overrated. It's not bad, just not what reviews claim it is. It's a story about one man's evolution in prison - nothing more, nothing less. I watched it, appreciated it, don't think I will ever be compelled to watch it again."
5,KILL KILL AND KILL,"You people like violence, then buy this game. THE BEST FPS EVER MADE> WHen i first played it at my friends house, i got hooked on it. It has some nice graphics, physics, and lot's of people to fight against. I recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS'"
4,great game,this is game is great for action and is much better than half life and unreal tournament!
4,Totally Wrong!,"This game works well on Windows 98, but twice as good on XP, which isn't included on the list, and on 98, I can't even finish a level. I need a Windows XP for myself now. I am hoping it works on that. My friend has the XP I used, and I thought it would work worse, but it works so much better, I was dying to play all the time I was there. We even finished the game! There is not enough RAM on my windows 98, and it's probably the problem. I have 56MB, I need 64MB. I would like to see what that XP has. I would not suggest using this on Windows 95 or 98, but on a newer model. This game needs some better testing."
5,Quake,"Quake is the best game ever! if you like action you will love this, umm even though its rated m id recommend Quake for anyone 11 or up if they know its not real."
4,An important and compelling book,"I found this description of the lives of orphans and abandoned children to be moving, heartbreaking and compelling. There was so much about the Vietnam war that overshadowed the great humanitarian effort to save children -- one of the few uplifting aspects of the war. This is a story that needed to be told by someone closely involved. Personally, I found the story about the last days in Saigon and the final hours at the Embassy to be quite gripping. I could hardly put the book down. The testimonies by the children leading new lives in the United States are bittersweet and worthy of reflection. I recommend this book to anyone who missed this dimension of the Vietnam story."
1,Not True But Not False,"I am a Vietnamese Adoptee, and have no doubt that Ms. Peck-Barnes story of what took place in Denver at the Continental Care Center is accurate. However, how can a woman who never stepped foot in Vietnam until 2005 know what happened over there. Her sources at best are shaky and some of the people who are mentioned in her book are not alive to defend themselves or lend their opinions to her. [...] Read the book if you must then investigate all of the other people who cared for us in Vietnam, then talk to us see how we feel."
3,Lead with chain,"The lead is good, a little bit short, but good. The chain is bad. I recieved the product brand new, but the chain was already dark."
3,medium,"Unlike other albums in the Exotic Sounds of series, this album does not contain the best work of the artist. I would start with ESO Martin Denny (which features Lyman) and then do Les Baxter and then this. . ."
5,He Is My Peace!,"I just LOVE PROPHETESS BYNUM! This cassette/CD is soooooooooooo uplifting! It literally brings hope to the hopeless and peace to the troubled. There has been many occassions in which I have been going through something and felt like giving up completely, but the songs and prophetic words that Prophetess Bynums shares ""shook me"" and restored my peace. GORLY BE TO GOD! It is also EXCELLENT for early morning praise and whorship. IT WILL USHER YOU INTO HIS PRESENCE FOR SURE! I know the title says ""Morning Glory"" but it has also caused me to have many peaceful nights. I strongly encourage YOU! to add this to your music collection. PEACE!"
3,"Elegant, fragile and no crystal ring","Very elegant, very fragile and when full, sounds like plastic when toasted. When empty, a nice ring but empty glasses are not often toasted.So, overall pretty but not great. Who doesn't toast champagne? IMHO, a nice ring is important."
4,Analog surfmonster?,"'Beyond the black hole' is a compilation of material from the Estrus days of Man or Astro-man?, similar to 'What remains inside a black hole' from '97. But not entirely. Exception number one: These tracks are digitally remastered, which makes the sound more powerful, ecspecially with this energetic surf-music. Exception numer two: It contains 3(?) previously unreleased, that is on disc-format, amazing tracks, not to be found on 'What remains inside a black hole'. So, if you already have 'What remains...' and if you are not a die-hard fan, you don't have to buy this one. But if you ARE a die-hard fan, you can't miss it. Plus: it's nice to hear those old analog surfmonster-sounds again, they make you wanna dance."
4,Thin wool sock,"This sock is a nice wool sock and not too thick -- good for rainy days that aren't too cold, when your feet might get a bit wet. It's a little tighter than I might wish, but other than that, good stuff."
1,LATE,"3 weeks and still waiting. (hold on, almost a month now) Do yourself a favor and don't use these guys unless of course you don't care to ever receive the product for which you have already paid."
1,NOT traditional Smartwool socks,I am a huge fan of Smartwool socks - I have worn them for years - but want to warn you away from these. They are not up to the Smartwool standard. They are not warm and the seams at the toe and heel are very rigid and awkward and do not fit comfortably when wearing shoes. Please avoid these!
1,very disappointed,"Have been wearing Smart Socks for years purchased from retail stores. No problem with them ever. Purchased 3 pairs from Amazon recently. The two black pairs sent from Amazing Socks are fine, but the brown pair from eSource Wellness produced two holes on the same sock the second & third time I wore them. One on the top of the foot and other on back of heel."
3,Good wool socks for work,"The company that I ordered them from is fast and excellent (Altrec). The socks are fashionable and keep my feet warmer than cotton socks, but they aren't super warm. I wear them to work and they are perfect for that."
1,Terrible quality,"Smartwool's cable socks are the worst socks I've ever bought. Both heels developed holes the first week that I wore them. Unlike every other Smartwool sock I've owned, the cable socks are paper thin and do not insulate."
4,Great socks!,"I really like these socks, but they don't seem as heavy as ones I bought in a store two years ago."
4,great socks!,"These socks give you support in the foot and ankle. However, the support lessens after several washings. I wish you could get them in white for summer."
2,Really Smartwool?,"These don't fit well at all - they are boxy around the heel and toe - and my feet sweat when I wear them. My feet never sweat when I wear real Smartwool socks, or I wouldn't buy them. I guess that's what I get for ordering from a site other than smartwool.com."
3,Disappointed,"I love Smartwool socks, but these are a disappointment. There is a hole in the toe of one of the socks!"
1,The only book I ever returned,"I can't be totally negative about this book. It is well written and even gives a very good description of how to install dry wall tape. But that's about it. Unless the reader is a total novice, this book will add nothing to ones knowledge of how to finish a basement - it is much too basic to be of any help to anyone contemplating doing such a job themselves."
3,Not the only book you're going to need.,"I have no experience with remodeling, and have decided to finish my basement. I bought this book hoping it would show me how to do everything from framing to finishing. This book, however, gives general ideas, but not too many specifics. For example, at one point it says you may need to lay a vapor barrier down, and tells you to put on two coats of bitumen product and then a vapor barrier over it - it does not, however, describe in detail how to do this, i.e. how do you cover the whole floor/wall with the barrier without any gaps? Another chapter, the one on running the electricity, starts off by saying one should hire a contractor - not what I wanted to see. Last example, on framing it doesn't show how to frame windows. Anyway, a good start, however you'll need other books for the specifics."
3,Necessary Info... But Rather Dry,"Maybe it's all the legal jargon, but this book's a little tough to plow through... okay, fine, it's boring to read, for me anyway.The info in it is important to know. I wish it was presented in a much more accessible way though."
4,A nice story,"""The Victory Club"" was well written and a nice ""clean"" book.It did get a little preachy at times and I don't like how the one character who wasn't a Christian had the wayward life. Makes it seem that if you don't do things the Christain way, you will be miserable."
5,Excellent WW II Historical Fiction,"This book really opened my eyes to the heart ache of women who have loved ones fighting in a war. The 4 main characters are women who form a Victory Club. A club designed to support and help each other as well as others in the community during WW II.Each woman has struggles to over come and all (except one) look to God to help them through. It was provoking to witness how these women put their trust in God and built their faith, and how they fought against the temptations that were before them.My only disappointment is that I felt that the story ended too soon. I had wished that the author continued the story for a longer duration of time. But, it is still an excellent book and worth reading."
5,Awesome story...wonderfully written,"I picked up this book to read because it was about WW2. Robin Lee Hatcher is now one of my favorite authors. The way she writes her characters brings them to life, and I found myself wanting to walk into the book and live in the town with the rest of them. LOVED IT!!"
1,Horrible,"I also bought this cologne without smelling it first.... bad idea. It is horrible. Way too strong, and it gives me a slight headache."
1,Terrible,"Nigel Pennick is not a historian or mathematician, this is a fact made abundantly clear by the numerous inaccuracies in this book, which is probably why it doesn't cite any sources. Anyone who would give this a good review either knows nothing about history and math or they were paid to write one. On top of being inaccurate in many areas the book is loaded with typos and very vague, making many claims that it does not elaborate on. The book is very short so if you want to spend a few hours hating how ignorant people can publish books, buy this one."
4,SON LOVES IT!,"My son received this toy for his great report card about 9 wks ago. He sleeps with it and wears it everywhere. The only thing that I don't like is the strap. It's hard for me to get a good grip to insert the pegs/ fastners. I wish it's redesigned with a regular watch band buckle/fastners. Oh, I can't believe how the price has gone up. I got it online for $30 because I needed it rushed. Base price was about $22."
2,Very disappointed!!!,"I was expecting a lot more than this. I had never heard of Ben 10 until my four year old son asked for the watch for Christmas. I couldn't find the watch in stores and it was sold out on line, that made me want it for him even more. I finally found one on line. It cost $16 in stores but I bought it for 24.95 plus with shipping and taxes I paid a total of $31.45. When I got the watch I was so excited. After playing with it for a minute, it reminded me of a toy a child would get in a happy meal but a lot bigger. The size of it is another thing, my son is a twin and he is small four year old. The watch is too big for a four year old. I've never watched an entire show so I don't know if I'm missing the point of the show. I hope this is helpful."
2,Fine toy but WAY overpriced,"This is only 14 dollars and some change at Wal-mart. I'm glad I read the reviews. I almost bought it on Amazon because my son wants it so bad for Christmas. Thanks for all the previous warnings. There's a lot of deals on Amazon, but this isn't one of them."
5,Son,"My 3 yr old LOVES this toy. He has been asking for a Ben 10 watch ever since the movie came out. He watched the cartoon all the time, but it wasn't until the movie was made, that he started asking for one. He pretends he is the alien on the watch and fights off the pretend bad guys."
4,Ben 10,"My nephew's reaction was priceless. He was so happy he started screaming, running around and finally ran up to me for a hug. When I let go of him, he looked up at me and whispered thank you and wiped the tears from his eyes. He had no idea that this toy existed he only thought that the cartoon character had it. Now he has one too."
1,disgusted with product for the money spent,This toy should not be priced over $5 for what it does! And it is already broken...it makes one sound and now it doesnot even do that
2,Difficult Wrist Strap,"My son loves Ben 10 and had to have this watch. The play value of the watch itself is fine - he really likes it. But the strap is horrible. We cut off a couple of the tabs that stick up in hopes to make it fit better. The problem is that the band is not very adjustable. Yet it must be worn tight on the wrist because it is so large that if it is loose, it flops around. Please, please redesign this toy to fit small boys better - maybe with the velcro?"
1,Ben 10 Watch is HORRIBLE,"This is the worst ""toy"" I have ever purchased for the money. It is worse than the quality of a Happy Meal toy at McDonalds. I do not recommend it at all. The wrist band is stiff and much too big for a 6 year old arm; my son could not put it on himself. After 30 seconds he asked if we could give it back to Santa and get something else. Do not buy this item."
2,"Overpriced, Kids expect the`watch to do more","My 8 year old son was starting a new school and was nervous about the first day. He asked for this watch to wear it to school. It took two days for me to find one locally. My son was hoping for it to do more. He wanted it to be more like the real thing. My son said this isn't much better then a happy meal toy. I was thinking I just paid 10 times more then a happy meal for the watch! He did wear it for aboyt 2 weeks but since he said it didn't have ANY cool functions , he stopped wearing it."
4,pull up bar,"Great product with a very wide pull up range. Mounts easily with lag bolts to any wall studs. (Does not come with lag bolts, you have to buy 4 of them from a hardware store 5/16 X 2 1/2 in.) Overall a great product for home use."
2,don't expect instructions,"Not a bad nailer BUTThe only instructions it come with are how to load nails and those aren't very clear.The online 'instructions' at Paslode's website are only the warranty, nothing else.I contacted Paslode service and they sent me a manual for 4 other nailers, not this one.It works, es. Adjusting the depth is a guessing game without a manual. There is a large knob on top of the gun the purpose of which is a mystery."
5,Solid Tool - No Major Complaints,"I've had this gun for a couple of years now and it's always worked like it should. I got it to replace a cheap ""off brand"" nailer, and the difference is night and day. The head design is good & the depth of drive is consistent, with clean setting. Handles the full range of lengths without a problem. Could use a little more ""range"" on the depth thumbwheel, but not a huge negative. I also have the Paslode 16 ga. nailer and it's been great too."
1,Useless stuff from people who can't spell.,"I gave Quick Steel a try on my muffler. On the left side, a muffler hanger has rusted loose. On the other side, the inlet pipe has separated from the muffler.I sanded the rust away and I did a good job. I mixed the Quick Steel in small amounts. It set up hard and the repair looked fine. But, the very next day, while driving around the patches failed and my muffler is swinging in the breeze again.What a waste! It says right on the package that Quick Steel is supposed to work up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit and it's supposed to work on mufflers. They're wrong about that. It didn't even last one day. In this case, quick means quick to fail.I've decided if the folks who make something aren't bright enough to spell a simple word such as quick properly, they're not bright enough to understand materials science or chemistry."
5,Lighten up! Spirit has a sense of humor!,"Reading Be Blesséd: Daily Devotions for Busy Wiccans and Pagans is like having a kitchen-table chat with author Denise ""Dion-Isis"" Dumars over herbal ice tea on a sweltering summer day. While the Introduction shows this priestess of Isis Isis, Thoth, and Yemaya to be an organized, competent guide, Dumars's first chapter proves her to be an easygoing companion, and jokester to boot. Be Blesséd details numerous simple ways to infuse every aspect of even the busiest life with spiritual energy and meaning. The book encourages both excellent self-care and the nurturing of respectful, friendly relationships with the gods and goddesses of your choosing. (Dumars calls Thor the Dude of Dudes, a very accessible buddy-type; visualize him dispensing his wisdom from a bar stool, beer mug in hand.) Best of all, Be Blesséd feels like a book written by an explorer who genuinely lives what she teaches and enjoys life very much."
1,Be Blessed Daily Devotions,"Not very happy with this book. I thought that I was getting a book that would give me a daily thought to meditate on and give me something to think about for the day. I've managed to get through a couple of pages, keep in my bathroom to read in the morning to inspire me for the day, and I was sadly disapponted with it. Not much to go on for us busy Wiccans to carry us through the day. Daily Devotions are supposed to uplift you and give you something to think on that will make you feel better through the day. This doesn't do it! If you are looking for somethin of this nature, buy the Lewellyn calender."
4,"Weird, But Worth It","Each vignette is basically the same: two people seemingly miscommunicating and casting oddly ominous glances at one or the other. I did enjoy the soundtrack, though, which fits the mood. There is no point to this film, but that's part of its charm. It all seems to add up to more than it appears, but it doesn't really. I can't discern a real message. But don't let that stop you from watching it. It's better than a big-budget Hollywood shoot-em-up."
1,Attention Jim Jarmusch:,"Dear Sir:I write this merely to help you. Please understand that it is not my intention to undermine your artistic vision. That said, Coffee and Cigarettes is AWFUL. It is not post-modern and hip, it is just boring. The ""coolness"" value of the actual individuals having conversations is dwarfed by the absolute inanity of the conversations themselves, and the cinematography is shot in the flattest, most personality-free style I have ever experienced.I know you have worked with some very interesting people over the years, and it's great that you got them to work with you on this project, but in the future please stick at least in some small way to cinematic conventions such as plot so that you can showcase the real talents of your actors, cinematographers, editors, and key grips."
1,SOOOO BOOOOORING!!,"Boring, tedious, dull, monotonous, repetitive, unrelieved, unvaried, unimaginative, uneventful; characterless, featureless, colorless, lifeless, insipid, uninteresting, unexciting, uninspiring, unstimulating; unreadable, unwatchable; jejune, flat, bland, dry, stale, tired, banal, lackluster, stodgy, vapid, monochrome, dreary, humdrum, mundane; mind-numbing, wearisome, tiring, tiresome, irksome, trying, frustrating; informal deadly, ho-hum, dullsville, dull as dishwater, plain-vanilla.People whom you would think were interesting sit and drink coffee and smoke cigarettes and are uncomfortable with each other over and over and over and over.....YAWN!!!!"
2,metafictional experiment gone awry,"Psuedo-existential homage to the drugs of choice for many of us. Unfortunately, this idiosyncratic short on life's mundaneness isn't as provocative as its trailer."
1,unwatchable,I had really high expectations for this movie....a great premise andinteresting subjects. It could have been something special butcomes off forced and boring. Don't waste your time watching this movie.
1,How about ZERO stars for a ZERO of a movie?,"This ""movie"" was SO BAD, I just knew it had to get better. I waited through the segments for a glimmer of something funny, entertaining or even interisting...NOTHING! I hoped there was some punchline at the end or something to make these stories come together...NOTHING! Please, if you're reading this, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! I want the time of my life wasted on this back. I think I should sue!"
1,A colossal bore,"This movie sounds interesting, but, trust me, it isn't. There are some wonderful people in it, but it doesn't matter. They pretty much don't do or say anything. I have a high tolerance for boring and will hang in there to the end with many films that are quite dreadful. And I like talky movies--if they're smart. But this movie isn't intelligent and is just so very dull that even I couldn't stand it. I watched all of a few, but at least part of, every sequence--if you do buy or rent this movie, you'll be impressed--and it was tough going. The only sequence that was somewhat interesting was the one with Cate Blanchett. So, if you do rent or buy it and you're ready to throw in the towel, flip to that scene, just so you think you got something for your money. It's not great, but it's the best the movie has to offer."
1,"""Just don't tell anyone.""","Simply awful. the whole plot, if any, was about meanigless discussions that had no relevance or interest in one another while sipping coffee and smoking cigarettes. WHY ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT COFFEE AND CIGARETTES??!!!"
3,What goes with coffee and cigarettes...,"A collection of vignettes that take place in various setting but all include coffee and cigarettes. This film is all black and white. Some of the short scenes are funny, some sad, some just 'eh, what was that about?', and some that made you think. There are even two totally different scenes that have basically the same dialogue but have a different feel to them because of the actors. This is definitely not a film for everyone but it's worth a try -- the time flew by as I watched and while it was uneven it wasn't wasted time."
4,One of those uneven ones...,"By no means one of jarmusch' best efforts. My favorite episodes are ""Somewhere in California"" with Tom Waits expounding to Iggy Pop how how he just performed a life-saving surgery using his pen-knife. LOL. Another keeper is Renee French jealously guarding the right temp or her cup of java. Purr-purr!Forget about Beningi though. It might have worked with the ""Down by law"", but no cigar here. Other episodes fade away into quick oblivion, but each viewer will surely find his or her own favorite little story."
4,Awesome,"This movie has a very dry, awkward sense of humor. It is amusing to see so many familiar faces interacting in such strange and funny scenarios."
4,"Quirky, unusual, surprisingly funny","I saw this in the theatre and wasn't sure what to expect -- hadn't seen a Jim Jarmusch movie in a long time. I was pleased to see something else I hadn't seen in a long time - a movie without a real narrative, that presents simple little ideas gathered around a theme (the coffee and cigarettes), lets them play out and then moves on to the next. Judging by the other reviews here, a lot of people didn't get it, so let's presume it's an acquired taste. But if you like the idea of Tom Waits getting touchy over Iggy Pop's offer to introduce him to a drummer Iggy likes (Waits: ""What are you saying? The drumming on my records sucks?""), or Bill Murray pouring joe for the Wu-Tang Clan, this one'll tickle you. Some of it is hilarious, some of it is touching, all of it is in black and white."
3,"Like Life Itself, Sometimes Interesting, Sometimes Boring","The thing about Coffee and Cigarettes is that it is a movie that is completely realistic and shows conversations between people sitting around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. Like life itself, sometimes it is interesting, sometimes it is boring. With 11 different vignettes, not all of them shine like a diamond, some are as dull as lumpy coal. The movie is actually a mixture of the very good and the very bad, so overall, it just averages out to, well, average. Not a particularly entertaining film, unless you like to hear small talk around the table while people drink coffee and smoke cigarettes."
1,So BORING,"Several vignettes of mostly two people at a table, drinking coffee and smoking. Except in two cases I believe the characters had tea. I kept dozing off during the characters' very mundane conversations. What was the filmmaker trying to say? That we could all be stars? Sitting around drinking coffee and talking? Save your money, and go get your own coffee experience. I guarantee that no matter how boring it is, it has got to be more interesting than this film."
1,Quite a disappointment.,"This review is primarily for folks who aren't already Jim Jarmusch devotees.I suppose it's cliché, but, ""I really wanted to like this film!""A disappointment from start to finish. Too few meaningful moments separated by too much space and time. Little humor, charisma, even angst & edginess was in short supply. Sparse sets don't quite reach minimalist (minimalism would have been more forgivable). For example, why have customer background noises (but no other customers)? Running themes (e.g. cousins/siblings, self-conscious envy and nervous graciousness, vertical camera shots onto the tables) with no meaning.If you're hoping for an insightful film, a good bit of humor, or a few really shining moments for one or more of your favorite actors, I suspect you'll feel as let down as I did.Undoubtedly, hardcore Jim Jarmusch fans (and perhaps Cate Blanchett fans as well - hers is the one scene which shines a bit) will pick this one up, but I can't recommend it to anyone else."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G!,"An amazing, can't-go-wrong cast...goes WRONG. I'd have to assume these were either improvised pieces or written by the performers (no writing credits given); regardless, the results are uniformly dull. To sit through this in one sitting, you'd have to have the patience of Job; to be entertained by it, you'd have to be a flaming retard. The worst movie I've ever rented."
3,Cigaretts & Coffee,"Listen ... the Iggy Pop/Tom Waits bit is brilliant, so if you can score this at a great price just for that interview, then grab it, otherwise, watch that selection on YouTube, the rest leaves MUCH to be desired ... making for a fun watch one time."
3,authentic or artificial?,"Writer and director Jim Jarmusch gathers ostensibly random combinations of conversation partners in coffee shops for smoke, drink, and impromptu talk. There is no introduction or conclusion, no soundtrack except for the ambient, background noise of the various coffee shops, no narration or explanation, and filmed in black and white. But only two of the eleven vignettes worked for me; the others felt and sounded very much like playing for the camera. The effect was artificial rather than authentic human conversations about important matters."
2,slow death,"a perpetually boring and at times excruciating waste of time that hopelessly squanders the time of such otherwise intriguing individuals as Iggy Pop and Tom Waits.Out of self-respect, I had to shut the movie off at the point where the cool jazz-looking character is hounding his friend about there being something wrong. I took that as my cue to wake up from all the caffeine and put a stop to what was wrong: the entire premise of the movie.It's like some pointless snapshot of people doing practically nothing and taking way too long at that."
3,Make that decafe please,This DVD is worth seeing especial for fans of JJ. Any film that has Bill Murry and Taylor Mead has to be seen at least once.
4,pretty great,"I think this movie is great. Yeah, it's dry and it ""isn't about anything"", but I think it's hilarious and cool and awesome. I generaly like movies like this with no real ""story"", It's understandable that some people who bore easily wouldn't like this, but well I think its good."
3,This is just for certain people,"Once in a while I don't like movies most people love to death. Once in a while I love movies most people don't care for. That's right. It is a matter of preference. I like this one very subjectively. I know this one is not for everybody. Just for certain people - like myself. I like things unique, and this film falls into that category. Even though I like it, as a film it does not have high quality."
3,It Works On Some Interesting Levels,"I am admittedly a lover of hard core indie film, so I'm generally more forgiving of flawed works if I can discern a spark of genius. That's how I view Coffee and Cigs. The director may be well known, but looking at this film you get the idea that he's a first time filmmaker attempting to break some new ground. At times he accomplishes just that. At other times, you kind of wonder where the scene is going. I would say the only scene I did not like was the one with the two rocks stars (Iggy Pop and I forget the other guy's name). I think it okay to give stars their stroking, but this scene was all pop star hubris. Other than that, the film is actually a pretty warm and inviting series of anecdotes. Not for the super picky or Hollywood brainwashed."
3,"Murray, RZA and GZA","Its worth it just to see this scene alone. Otherwise, very slow but interesting and insightful."
2,meh,"I was expecting much more from this series of short films. More humor, more artistic expression, something. I watched until the end, hoping it would get better. It didn't. Most of the scenes were mildly entertaining, but not really worth watching for more than a few minutes."
2,bear,My son bought this for me to cheer me up. It was so cute. I would have never purchased this item however it came from my son so I love it!
5,Pamplona revealed,I truely enjoyed this book. Someday I will get there and also live the legend of this city that Ernest made popular- though it was doing just fine without him.Good writing takes you to a place you have not been before and Ray Mouton does it with this book.
1,BROKE AFTER TEN MINUTES,ENGINE STOPPED AFTER TEN MINUTES ---- AMAZON.COM SAYS I AM ON MY OWN!!!IF LAWN-BOY DOESN'T MAKE GOOD ON THIS I WILL GO BACK TO AMAZON AND IF THEY DON'T MAKE IT RIGHT -- I WILL LET YOU KNOW.
4,I felt like I had really been there on the river.,I enjoyed this book because it gave me the feeling of having actually gone down the river with the author. I also liked hearing about it from the point of view of a woman in her forties.
2,Good for Generalization,"This book gives a good general overview of how to restore an XJ model. But, does not go into any of the small details on making the vehicle run properly. I.E.; nothing is mentioned about the vehicles electrical system. It is nice to know how to rebuild an engine, but, without knowing how to hook up the electrical system it will never run. Too much emphasis on how to buy the car and not how to fix it."
2,Invest your money elsewhere,"Good idea, but poorly executed. I spotted one glaring error immediately, author refers several times to door cards as leather when they are in fact vinyl and thus require completely different care. Too many pages devoted to a complete engine rebuild, not enough to restoration/repair of items more likely to need fixing on a car of this age. Rather than buying this and the Haynes service and repair manual, pool your money and buy the official workshop manual."
4,A reasonable guide to restoring an XJ6:an overview.,"The copy I bought is a hardcover edition with a different cover but same ISBN by same author.(Haynes # H4020).This book covers a general guide/overview to restoring an XJ6, history and a buyers guide,etc.Its not a complete bolt by bolt restoration guide.But,it does offer enough information for any DIY to get the general idea.Its a reasonable book for what it has to offer.For what this book is,it is a good book to start with.This is a general overview of restoration.Its not a complete restoration manual.You should buy a workshop manual and/or a factory manual as well.This book on its own is okay but consider buying specific books that show how to paint your car,restore interiors,rebuild engines,etc.The book is good value too.I hope the publisher considers publishing a similar book for the XJ12 model Jaguars,with more indepth chapters please."
1,Didn't work at all.,"This was a Christmas present for my son. Unfortunately, it would not even turn on. A big disappointment. Received a full refund from Amazon."
2,Product good but support is terrible,"The product is fairly easy to use though re-ordering and removing sections is not very intuitive. Spell checking is very slow. Also, I had a problem where, after I already purchased and activated the product, it said I had to enter the activation key again. When I did it said I already entered the key. Now I can't get at my resume. I have not been able to get any phone or email support at all."
1,Don't buy...,"I definitely got what I paid for. There are some issues with this software. It is not very well laid out and it is not conducive to current Word software, etc. I had to re-do a lot of it after it ""moved"" to a software that I could print from, etc. I ended up throwing the software away and just doing it manually."
1,Horrible user interface,"You will spend more time trying to figure out how to create a resume using this horrible product than actually using it. The user interface is horribly bad. It is impossible to change field size or make changes to the entire document at once. The fields are very rigid and do not allow for custom fabrication. Forget about using keyboard short cuts; it's either the tools on the menu bar or nothing. Stick with a word processor to create a resume, not this piece of garbage. If I could take back an opened software box to the store where purchased, I would in a second."
1,Very Poorly Written Software,Difficult to navigate. Nearly impossible to make revisions or correct mistakes. It is much easier and more effective just to write it in MS Word from the beginning. I tossed it in the garbage.
4,Milk thistle dandelion,"Increase bile secretion, no side effect. Should be taken as directed. Absolutely NO ALCOHOL while taking it; otherwise discomfort and pain in right upper quadrant of abdomen."
4,Chen Kuan Tai Shines Very Brightly Here...,"It's a shame Chen Kuan Tai wasn't the main star of this film, but what scenes he does grace are superb. As morgoth alludes to in regards to the opening scene fighting, he's dead on. Simply outstanding choreographing in the beginning of this film. Chen Kuan Tai (Iron Monkey 77 The Killer Constable and Shaolin King Boxer)was in reality King Boxer of South East Asia (monkey style and deflecting elbow were his specialties) when he was discovered by Shaws Brothers and this film showcases some of his abilities. Great film. A must own for any Chen Kuan Tai fan."
1,Keep an Eye On It!,"This item worked well for a short time but you had better keep an eye on it. I left it in a temperature controlled environment and initially checked it every month for charge. I got a little complacent and let three months pass without checking it, needed it during a power outage and, as luck would have it - it was completely dead. Apparently one of the cells in a battery shorted. This caused a complete discharge of both batteries. You would think the system could monitor this for the $300 price."
2,pro's and con's,"I use the power pack as backup in my truck, so I don't have to drain the starting batteries. I thought that 1500 watt inverter would be plenty. First complaint is that the battery is only 51ah. Basically it will run 40 watts for 9 hours , so you can watch t.v for 9 hours it has a dc outlet so you can use that. The inverter has a annoying alarm when the battery gets to low. You can run a microwave for about 10 minutes and then you have to recharge again . Recharge time 8hours using the car and 12 hours using the house. So as far as back up power I would not want to be caught with this power pack in a power outage, unless you just plan on watching t.v. or charging you cell phone and no usb either. 2 stars"
1,Do not buy!,"2nd one I purchased, batteries discharge while plugged into wall.Had the very same problem with first one then batteries went dead after 2 years.This thing really sucks!!!!"
1,Do not buy!,This is the second 1500 I purchased. I returned the first one and now the second one is working. I own two of the 600's which outperform the 1500. Very disappointed with this product. Buyer beware!
3,Badly damaged once again.,"I previously ordered two of these units and wrote a review. Both were badly damaged, but one was salvagable. The other I had to return, after it overheated and emitted a noxious odor. I decided to take a chance and order another unit this month (goal was to have total of two working units), hoping that whatever warehouse or shipping issues that resulted in previous damage had been resolved. They weren't. This unit also came with crushed top and wheels. Until the manufacturer comes up with a better way to ship these heavy beasts, not worth it."
1,Didn't work,"After searching for a battery powerpack I was excited to find this product. After receiving it I followed the manufacturer's recommendations and plugged the unit in overnight. The next day, nothing - no power. I went to a Xantrex forum and found that sometimes a battery needs 7 days of charging to restore it. I plugged it in for 7 days and, nothing, totally dead. I am still waiting for a call tag from Amazon for return."
4,Performs as Advertised!,"I bought this unit in the summer of 2007 to power a tv, satellite dish, and receiver during tailgating at college football games. I decided to give it a practice run before football season started so I charged it up as directed and plugged up the unit and turned on my 13"" tube tv and let Directv run until the battery gave out. According to the formula in the manual it should have lasted almost 8.5 hours and it ran over 9 hours (82 watts total AC draw). It will also be our backup if we get more hurricanes. Can't wait to use it this fall!"
1,Xantrex won't sell parts for repair on this item,I have a Xantrex Xpower 1500 and the inverter alarm light comes on with nothing plugged into it and the batteries fully charged. I contact Xantrex to see about replacing the inverter and they don't sell repair parts. They did however offer me a customer discount on a new unit - Don't Think So!
4,XANTREX REALLY WORKS,"I decided to purchase this product after experiencing a prolonged black out while shaving my face around 5 am. ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH. I have tested this generator to determine its capacity to deliver the next time I would need it. It will function well if used to operate small low powered decvices, radio, tv, computer, shavers, light fixtures, charging cell phones, etc. however it is not up to snuff for larger appliances such as a refrigerator or freezer. Recharge every 3-4 months to keep charge level full this take 1-2 minutes and recharge immediately after using. A fantastic product for times when everything in your house goes out out except your flash light."
5,Works as advertised,"Good quality.. I did have to work on some rough areas in the threads of the jack screw, but no big deal."
5,Great Stand,Bought this as an addition to the other older stand we have in the shop I work at. OTC is always a good tool brand and this is no exception. The Amazon price with free shipping was a much better deal than what Snap On or Cornwell wanted for their brands. Don't have a Mac or Matco truck come by right now so wasn't able to compare their prices. The actual delivery time (at least 2 weeks) was longer than usual but that was no big deal.
2,Anne of Green Gables Music,This music isn't nearly as good as the original Harwood Hagardy edition from the original.
3,The tool is good but the battery Is Wack!!,"My battery lasted about 2 years under little use. Item is heavy, what good is a tool when the battery is not working. Item is built good but the Battery Design sucks. I wouldn't have bought this if I knew the battery would die with so little use. Impact gun couldn't take out a torque bolt to 150ft.lbs. The rating mean squat. It couldn't take some of my bolts. I mostly use it for tire changing and some car suspension work. Hope this review helps. Mostly work on Honda/Acura!! 3 stars. Battery Sucks, Heavy, Battery sucks, didn't take some of my bolts ~weak~. Bottom line don't get this tool if your looking into spending hundreds on battery replacements. OK tool nothing special needs more power and better battery design!!!!!!"
1,Not as advertised,"I purchased this tool to help me remove 32 lug nuts from a Ford F350 Super Duty. These nuts were all torqued to 148 ft. lbs. with a certified Proto torque wrench with a very light coating of oil on the threads. This tool would not budge these lug nuts. My wife's Taurus has its lug nuts torqued to 100 ft. lbs. with the same Proto certified torque wrench. Same result. Once the lug nuts were removed, I used the tool to install the nuts. As best I can determine, the torque applied was around 80 ft. lbs. Quite a bit different from the 240 ft. lbs. advertised. My advise is to look elsewhere."
3,"A BIT ON THE LIGHT SIDE, BUT....","ABOUT WHAT EXPECTED. MAY NOT MATCH UP TO A GOOD AIR IMPACT, BUT WORKS ANYWHERE. EVER CHANGED A PICKUP TRUCK TIRE MILES FROM NOWHERE? EIGHT LONG FINE THREAD LUGS? YOU'LL SING THE PRAISES OF THIS WRENCH."
5,Incredible Cooking Resource!,"Have you ever found yourself wondering, ""What really is the difference between Ice Cream, Sherbet, Sorbet, and Gelato?"" or ""Is Allspice just a blend ALL Spices?"" or ""Do I really need to sift my flour?"" All of these questions, and many, many more are easily answered in this amateur chef's bible. Even though it is primarily a reference book, I've frequently been drawn into reading parts of it like a novel while doing a ""quick"" check of some obscure ingredient.Whenever I have a question about food, cooking, or ingredients, this is the first place I turn. When I'm through, I frequently find myself exclaiming to my wife, ""This really is a GREAT book!""From Abalone to Zucchini, this colorful reference guide to all things culinary is a must for every kitchen!"
4,Great Leadership Tips,I would encourage every one that is serious about improving their positive influence on the people you work with and for to take the plunge.
5,Love it,"A classic...I already owned it; bought this one for making annotations as the other one is in use as a facilitator's copy for a book study. Wonderful for beginning leaders and for leaders who are time-worn and need some ""pep"" in their leadership style!"
5,Mack is the Man,"John Mack is, needless to say, an amazing musician and a brilliant oboe player, and this disc is an excellent representation of his art. I especially love the Loeffler trio, which I think is such a beautiful piece, and here we get to enjoy the combination of Mack's gorgeous sound with the luscious warmth of the viola in ways I wish more romantic composers had explored! An unusual collection of music but well worth a listen (or two, or seven...)!"
3,Great Music -- So-so Sound Quality,"I have always been a great fan of the oboe. So more than anything, I was looking for a CD that would faithfully reproduce the sound of the instrument. While John Mack is clearly a virtuoso, and the musical selections are beautiful, the recording is not up to par.There is a tremendous amount of surface noise from the original tape machine (or perhaps a turntable if this was transferred from vinyl). In addition, there is an intermittent flapping noise that seems to be an exaggeration of the sound of keys being quickly pressed and released. But it's the surface noise that spoils it for me."

3,Vash's Review (the knickname i go by),"RC blades take the fun out of the game. You can't customize them or use them in tournaments, so whats the point? For less money, you could get the new blades from Japan that are made completely out of metal and are the highest quality blades ever made, so get one of those."
4,Just Awesome!,This launcher is better than the electronic launchers. When they say remote control they mean it controls its spin not it's movement. It comes with a dranzer v2 beyblade that can't be customized except for the attack ring. The beyblade is so huge that it always wins. The launcher is very comfortable to hold so it makes your launch better. The ripcord is sideways so you can always get a full power rip. This launcher rocks!!
1,Outdated- prices have changed,Get a newer ones - prices have changed in the last 6 yrs. - this is now a waste of money.
2,Harmony Kindom Value Book,The book did not address all of the Harmony Kingdom available at the time. I bought it as a value book and at least 1/3 of the book had no price references.
4,Spock Does Hallucinogens -- and Jill Ireland,"For the first time in his life, Spock has a good time. After Jill Ireland's character, Leila, tricks him into ingesting hallucinogenic spores, he smiles, laughs, plays in trees, marvels at clouds and sunsets, and becomes incredibly insubordinate to captain Kirk. He also falls in love with Leila.Eventually, the entire crew, with the exception of the captain, succumb to the spell of the spores and abandon the Enterprise in lieu of an idyllic life on a peaceful planet.This fun episode is a bit slow in parts, but Kirk's solution to the problem is one of those classic Trek moments. It must be viewed to truly appreciate. Over all, a very good episode."
5,Good but could be better.,"this is a good CD, however my kids only listent o gangster rap so this record hasnt seen a lot of spins in this house."
1,14K Gold Large Oval Tubal Hoops Earrings,"The product was a LOT smaller than I expected, based on the description. They are definitely NOT Large by any standards. I was highly disappointed in this product."
5,Never Kissed Goodnight,"After reading this book, I ordered and read all six of the ""Koslow"" series and also the short story which I normally don't bother with. But these stories are so good that I got the short story as well. The stories are based in the Pittsburgh PA area and it was nice to read about the area whwere I spent my childhood."
4,Entertaining mystery,"I enjoyed readingNever Kissed Goodnight (Leigh Koslow Mystery Series). The main characters were diverse and well-drawn. Leigh herself is a Character worth knowing: enthusiastic, driven, and (generally) caring of those around her. The plot concept and pacing were very good. Action began early and there were enough surprises to pull me forward.It's a relief to find a book with restraint in cussing and sex. No reliance on ""big gore"" either.I highly recommend this one to fans of light mysteries."
4,Super reading,"Leigh Coslow is a funny, interesting personality. She gets herself in and out of trouble in the most fascinating ways. A great book for us mystery lovers."
5,Fun to Read,"An easy to read book, lighted and funny. Edie is a good writer that keeps you wanting more of her stories."
5,Another good one!,I can't say enough about Leigh Koslow or her author Edie Claire. I can't wait for more. Reading her other books now.
4,Never kissed,I liked all of her books. They were a good read with some mystery. I enjoyed this book and was not disappointed.
3,Meh,"I continue to buy this series because I've gotten attached to the characters, but the stories themselves aren't great. Not bad, if you just want something for killing time, but there are definitely better books out there. A little repetitive, a little predictable.. and to be honest.. a little boring too. Once again, not bad, not great."
4,Cute slice of life anime.,"Anime news network summed it up pretty well , "" Cute girls do cute things in cute ways."" Its a good show, not great , but at such a cheap price its worth checking out."
1,Poor Imitation of Wilton Armetale.,"Just like the rest of the pieces in the same line ""Butterly Meadow"" (metal) this stained after a few monhts use, and even though I tried many different ways (even ones suggested by Lenox) none has worked. The inside of the bowl is permanently stained and the bowl is ruined."
5,"What A Book, A Must Read........","Bill may have been a little excessive in 1 or 2 instances in this book, but otherwise his examples were precise, well documented, and accurate. I found the book to be alarmingly true and valid about the schmucks from Bentonville. It will validate what you probably already know, but get a little more fired up. Read this book and you will think twice as a city before letting Wal-Mart in your town or think twice before stepping in one to shop. Learn about what Wal-Mart does because it defies capitalism, their pre-fab ways and consolidation are down-right socialist. With Slick Willy and Wal-Mart, I'm starting to wonder if anything good comes out of Arkansas."
1,Whew! Get a life people!!!,"did you read these summaries? what junk!I'm sure the wal-mart in texas employs more than the retail stores it put out and allows the citizens to retain more of their money. Now, instead of being a drag on the economy, you can actually contribute.I guess they don't realize that wal-mart is (at least about a week ago) the largest american employer in the US besides the Government.""They should sign a book entitled ""How to get ANYTHING published"""
4,Read this book prior to going to Wal-Mart,"If every thoughtful consumer read this book, Wal-Mart would be going out of business. Throughout the book, Bill Quinn repeatedly reminds the reader that he is no friend of the Waltons and their ilk. His writing style is folksy, extremely easy to read and factual. I even learned of some new reasons not to like Wal-Mart, however much of it I've heard and seen before. I wish that the writer had more specific statistics to back up his anecdotal examples. It would have made his conlusions even more compelling.You have to wonder how a company with such predatory business ethics could have been so successful. I guess it speaks for the ignorance of the masses."
4,A different way of thinking about giant box retailers.,"Bill Quinn has researched his subject for an extended period and continuely reached the same conclusion; Walmart is effectively an insensitive hipocritive organization. This book is an early warning sign of a gaint about to fall. This book will keep you on your toes as an investor or competitor or consumer when tracking information about various retailers.Quinn writes like he talks. He doesn't hold back expressing his deepest thoughts about a subject. Especially a subject like Walmart, that directly and indirectly has negatively inpacted his pocket book."
2,Disorganized Hearsay (mostly),"Bill Quinn has written this book in a very disjointed and disorganized manner. In addition, a lot of the information in the book seems to be based on anecdotes by disgruntled Wal-Mart haters. Could have been better organized and used more research-based facts."
3,Interesting...,"How Wal Mart is Destroying America (and the World) By Bill QuinnThe author of this book is very convinced that Wal Mart is evil, in fact he appears to hate Wal Mart more than anything else in the world. His writing is very convincing with all of this ""proof"" that people have given him, however like everything else don't take something just on someone's word. If you are pro Wal Mart (like I am) you might want to just read this at a library sometime, after reading maybe ask some of the employee's questions. However if you already hate Wal Mart you might want to buy a copy.Reed Floren"
1,kind of a simplistic book,"This book points out some of the problems of big corporations, problems I would say are not unique to WMT. The trouble with this book is that it assumes people in small towns are too stupid to make their own choices. If WalMart didn't deliver value, no one would shop there and it would go out of business. If people in small towns valued smaller stores over lower prices, they would not shop at WalMart--who is this author to say they are making the wrong choice? WMT is the largest employer in the country of minorities and has the largest proportion of minority managers of any large company. As for goods made in China, I have no problem with that. Don't the Chinese need jobs too? Shouldn't we be designing computer networks instead of making plastic toys?"
1,this does'nt even deserve a one star,"I am writing to let everyone know how our Wal-Mart has helped my family, Wal-Mart has given over $1 billion dallars to the Childrens Miracle Network, not to mention Big Brothers and Big Sisters and most recently The March of Dimes, They have helped all the little people, by donating money, time and their hearts to those in need, People see what they want to see, and Sam Walton saw The Big Picture. I do not work for Wal-Mart, I live in a small community, and anytime a disaster hits, (fires, etc.) Wal-Mart is always there, The biggest contributor, the most heart filled employees, and I thank them for being around. Maybe I should write a book, and let the readers decide, You believe what you want, and I'll believe in Wal-Mart."
1,Get a life!!,"This man is obsessed with wal-mart. If he hates them as much as he states,he should move to a country where capitalistic pigs are not allowed...then he would understand the difference between a free market economy and a command ecomony. As stated by someone I know not...""It's not perfect, but it's way ahead of what's in second place"".Sure there are internal and external problems with wal-mart and every other large corporation. I agree with the other book review writer who stated that Mr. Quinn makes small town folk look incapable of making decisions as to their shopping preferences. If they are treated so badly, they wouldn't shop there and wal-mart would close.Mr. Quinn's problem with wal-mart is personal. America, and the world, vote with their dollars and apparently overwhelmingly support wal-mart's concept."
3,A lot of anecdotes but no smoking guns here.,"The author has a bias against wal-mart and he never bothers to conceal it. He even refers to Wal-Mart as ""Bentonvillians"" and ""blankety-blanks"". This gives you an idea what to expect throughout. At least you know what you're in for.Unfortunately it appears most of the information comes from disgruntled former employees and other people who have an axe to grind. While the anecdotes are amusing and informative most of them appear to be isolated incidents. He never gives specific insider information that this was all part of some grand plan. It just looks like a bumbling bureacracy with some medium level tyrants.The most insightful information given is the information about the moving around of management level employees so they don't get settled in and the fact that Wal-Mart fights (and appeals) every lawsuit.I hate Wal-Mart as much as the next fella but I'd prefer to have a few less amusing anecdotes and a few more smoking guns of intentional wrongdoing."
5,The Truth can set you free!,"I always felt there was something wrong and soulless every time I stepped into a Wal-mart, I just couldn't put my finger on it. After reading this book, the truth about Wal-mart is here -- every bit as scary as I imagined. Inside the book, Quinn supports his anti-Walmart message with FACTS and ACTUAL EVENTS and LAWSUITS, showing us why the last thing you should want in your community is the [is the local] store, because that will basically mean the end of your community. From horrible treatment of workers, low wages, lack of community involvement, destruction of the environment, lack of respect for ecology, willful destruction of competitors and misuse of its OWN CUSTOMERS, Wal-mart has done it all. Its high time we stop supporting them. Read this book, do something about Wal-mart, we can make a difference."
5,"Blue arcs, not rainbow. Fascinating item.","This is a well built & fascinating item. I predict it will become a conversation starter when people notice it, especially since it's portable. But the one picture is wrong here. It gives off BLUE arcs, not rainbow. Yes, there are 3 positions on the switch. OFF, ON, and SOUND ACTIVATED."
4,Loved it!,Got this for my grandson for christmas. He loved it (8) and everybody else loved it also. Didn't matter what age they were they all enjoyed it!
1,didn't last,fun toy. only lasted ten minutes. my son dropped it and that was that. did hold his interest until it met the floor.
5,Perfect Textbook - Clear and Easy to Understand,"""Chess For Juniors"" is the textbook used at our school's chess program for kids from grade 2 to 8.The book is logically set up in twenty lessons that are clear and easy to understand for any student in grade 2 on up. The reading level is probably 5th or 6th grade level. However, it is still easy enough to read for students in lower grades.The index at the back of the book makes it easy for a student to quickly locate any term or concept.""Chess For Juniors"" is extremely comprehensive covering every concept that is needed to take a student from absolute beginner up to an intermediate skill level. Covered are all of the basic rules, ideas behind the opening (including setting up a basic opening system), the very most basic endgames (basic checkmates & King and Pawn endgames), tactics (including some problems to work on) and much, much more.This is certainly a ""complete"" guide for the beginner!"
3,OK but has gaps,"This is not a bad book, and the content is reasonable. Presentation is satisfactory, but I found it dull in parts, and there are gaps. [...] It would be better if he concentrated on writing books."
1,Printed book price is $14 but it sells for much more,"Sellers indicate a very high marked price for this book. However, the book has a printed price of USD 14 on the back cover. Is this because the book is not in print now?"
5,Fantastic Book,This is book which provides a great and consistant method of teaaching kids around. Just read the last review (obiously not a kid but someone out to get the sucess of this book with a problem hiding) - WOW! Such humor and would love my kid to learn from methods which have made this book become the top seller!I have read this book from cover to cover even though this is a book titled for kids.Adult or Child all will love the humor and great teaching methods used by the author.
5,Not What I Wanted? Buyer Not Beward,"This book is EXACTLY what I hoped for when I ordered it from Amazon... awesomely written and nicely designed. Here is a sample from page 202 that is supposed to be educational: ""Once upon a pawn a time, many moves ago, on a chessboard far far away, there was a dumb but happy kingdom. The birds were always chirping, the cows always gave milk, and"" - well you get the idea. Kids love the entertainment!There are no better introductory courses elsewhere on Amazon.If only the reviews of this book hadn't been accurate I would have have wasted my money on another book!"
5,Good for anyone Grade 3 on up,"CHESS FOR JUNIORS is an amazing book. It is at a reading level that my third grade brother can understand and a seventh grader will still very much like. I think it was put together with a lot of thought and understanding of how a kid learns and likes to learn.If you do not know anything about chess at all CHESS FOR JUNIORS will teach you from the start. If you know how the pieces move and maybe a little stuff about stratigic play then CHESS FOR JUNIORS will teach you things right and puts it in a way for you to grasp it. I like ""a Knight on the rim is dim, its chances are very slim"". It has neat saying and rymes so you can remember things that are important.It shows you about openings, endgames and things to use to set up checkmates and win the opponents pieces.I also do well at our school chess club and am the top player there after reading this book."
5,Easy to understand,My husband loves this book. He wants to be able to play with all the grandkids when they come over and this has been very helpful.
3,Endgame coverage could be more extensive,"The endgame is a bit neglected in this book. As this is one of the more important stages for a player just starting chess, I feel this could be an area to be improved in future."
5,Tells things good,This book makes it so easy to learn chess and teaches you not only the rules but shows you strategies to help you to win. It had no problem understanding it. It is goo d for an 8 year old or an adult.You learn from 20 lessons that progress in easy to learn steps.Lots of diagrams to show you the graphical things. A great book.
5,Was looking for this book,This book is what I was looking for. It uses good humor to keep my interest. The Dumb Kingdom story is great. It is well organized and easy to learn from.
5,Kewl!,"This is a Kewl book. It gave me the ability to beat the other kids at the chess club and I won a second place trophy at the county youth chess championship. I couldn't have done it without this book. I warded off scholers mates, used two backrank mates and some forks to win.This book will also help you win!"
1,don't buy this...,"This convicted child molester author with his boyish good looks should rot penniless in prison; but if he ever gets out, make it without a nest egg. Instead, check out top quality books by Dan Heisman or even C J S Purdy. Larry Evans would even be better than this. Just say no to 'lithe Athenians.'"
5,First Book in a Wonderful Series for the Young Reader,"The author has created the best series of chess books that a beginning or intermediate child or teen can get.CHESS FOR JUNIORS is the first book in the series. The author uses 20 Lessons in the book to introduce all of the basics. However, as you get deeper into the book it gets into the most important strategies, such as tactics (smothered mate, backrank mate, pins, forks, skewers, discovered attacks and much more), openings and endgames.The author has a unique quality of being able to reach kids through some great humor and sayings that help students to remember the material in the book.This book will provide a chess teacher with enough material to take their students forward for many months.The flow of the book and its clarity has certainly done the job to distinquish this book as the best selling chess book in the country."
4,Great for a proof album.,"These refil pages are very affordable for the price. I ordered them along with the matching album, except the pages that came with the album were black and the refil pages are white.... dont know if i could have specified a color. It is only noticable from the top and bottom, so nothing to really stress out about. Good quality, great pricing, and fast shipping."
1,making more money out of a huge success,"This film is quite more elaborate than the first one 'Pelo Suelto' the making is neater and the quality in total is better. But it is quite the same story, very similar characters and ending. Nevertheless this film is a must for any Trevi follower, almost a long length videoclip. After knowing the terrible story behind the success of the star that took both producer and artist to jail for child abuse ( gloria lost seven years in jail before being declared innocent, producer sergio andrade remains) the scenne where gloria and other little girls put on bikinis and pretend modeling gets quite disturbing and sickening..."
5,Better stock up on Band-Aids,This will get your knives so sharp you can cut yourself and not even realize you've done it. The one I bought at Christmas was so great I immediately ordered another for my brother's birthday gift. He too loves it and has already sharpened all his knives and my mother's too.
2,Ruin your knives appearance,"Altho the product works well enough as a sharpener, it has the nasty practice of marling the sides of the knives, so that after a few sharpenings, the knives look abused."
3,A Gift,"This was a gift for someone who REALLY needed to have his knives sharpened. He took them to a knife sharpener, but the knives did not hold their edge."
3,Disappointed,"I am not very impressed with this product so far. However, I've only used it once since it arrived so I will keep an open mind. Maybe after using it some more, it may change my mind. At the moment, I don't feel that this product sharpens my knives well enough."
1,chef's choice M130 knife sharpener,received the sharpener on time but expected more from this product. It didn't do any more that a $30 sharpener I already have. This is suppose to be a top of the line professional grade item. I doubt most professionals would rate this very high.
2,Poor Quality,"I received my new M130 sharpener last week. I returned it the next day. I have a set of Carvel Hall kitchen knives that had become pretty dull and thought I would try my new sharpener on them. I gathered up 7 of the knives and headed to the basement where I had my new sharpener set up. I sharpened the first six knives and they really came out sharp. I was impressed. But while finishing the 7th knife in the polishing/stropping station, the polishing wheel broke. I also collect knives and so my sharpener would have gotten alot of use. I don't feel that the M130 could stand up to that much use. I would rate it as a light home use sharpener. It did a very good job sharpening but the quality is just not there to hold up to alot of use. Maybe I'm just too rough but I don't think so.I'll check into the Chef's Choice commercial sharpener."
4,Great time saver,"This item produces a very sharp edge in a short amount of time making it a great time saver in a busy kitchen. The angle of the edge is the only thing keeping me from rating this 5 stars. The angle is very steep, unlike the angle produced by hand sharpening on a wet stone akin to the Oregon stone. Unfortunately, there is no way to adjust this as the guides are preset. This takes a little getting used to but the fact that you can go from completely dull to razor sharp in a few minutes more than makes up for it. Unless you have endless hours of free time to hand sharpen a blade, this is an excellent piece of equipment."
5,Exceeded all expectations!,"I have high quality knives which I have had professionally sharpened over the years. But after having read a good review of the M130 in Cook's Illustrated, I decided to give it a try for the sake of convenience. I started on some old knives that I haven't bothered to maintain, and it did an excellent job. I then moved on to my better knives and the results were surprising. I think the edge is every bit as good as the best I've gotten from a professional sharpening service, and even better than the factory edge. I also love the steel function, which does a better job and with less effort than I am able to get using my regular steel. Best part is the ease of use. I was not able to get the edge I wanted on my Henckels cleaver due to the thickness of the blade, but I did improve the edge over the factory. Excellent machine."
4,Meets my expectations,"This works well for keeping my every-day work knives serviceable. Short paring knives are a little trouble, and it does not put on the same quality edge a pro with a belt sharpener does. It takes far less time to keep the cutlery up than using a stone."
5,It is nice to have something that really works as advertised,I have tried a number of different knife sharpeners over the years and have always been unhappy with the results. Even if I carefully followed the instructions on how to sharpen a knife they never seemed to be any where near as sharp as when they were new.I read a report on knife sharpeners in Cooks and the M130 was the highest rated and the most expensive as I recall. We decided to order the machine and it really works. The knives are actually as sharp as they were when purchased. You could probably open a business sharpening knives with this machine and it would pay for itself. You could also impress your friends and family by sharpening their knives.I recommend this machine.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Does a decent job. However, scratched some of my high grade forged Wusthof knives. As another reviewer stated, does not affect the performance of the knives. Did not do a good job on some of my knives. I felt they could be a lot sharper then they were. I followed the instructions carefully and did develop the burr as described in the instuctions. It did do a pretty good job on some of the knives but didn't do a good job on others. As soon as the Wusthof electric sharpener dropped in price, knowing the quality of the manufacturer, I decided to splurge and purchase it. I am very happy I did, although it doesn't do serrated and Asian knives, it does a fabulous job on straight edge knives. After reading the instructions, I ran a carving knife I was having a problem with for several strokes through the fine slot and wow!!, the proverbial hot knife through butter. As a result, all the knives I was having a problem with are now scary sharp. I will retain the 130 as a back up."
5,OH - SO Sharp!,I bought this Knife Sharpener and am so glad that I did. I have expensive knives and they never seem to hold an edge. This sharpener actually sharpens them better than the factory did. I'm thrilled to have found this!!!!
5,Chef's Choice,It does exactly like it is supposed to and does it very well. Now we have sharp knives everywhere. Thank you.
3,Model 120 is better!,"After enjoying the model 120 for numerous years, I decided to buy another 120 and a 130. I wish I would have bought two of the 120s now. The 130 to me does not give me the lasting sharpness as the 120 does. If you are trying to decide between the 120 or the 130, then make it the 120."
5,watch your fingers after you use this item.,"I am real big about knives being sharp,and I usually use the Lansky system or oil stones to get the job done,and I still use them for my pocket knives. I own some nice kitchen knives snd I was a little leary about using an electric sharpener on them. Not any more! The chef's choice works as advertised.It makes all your knives very sharp without scratching up the blade.Be sure to warn others in the household after using the chef's choice so they know to watch their fingers. Good product,good investment, glad I got it. One last thing,the chef's choice works really fast.What used to take me at least a couple of hours now only takes a few minutes."
5,Easy to use,"Cook's County Kitchen show highly recommended this sharpener. I have to say that it is very easy to use and does a great job sharpening. Would highly recommend, it's worth the price."
4,I'll never have to buy a new knife set again!,"I was given this as a gift and was somewhat skeptical, however with my father-in-law's constant raving about this product, I had to give it a try. So tonight I did and I must say that my knives are know sharper than they were when I first bought them, which I did not think was possible since the knives are high quality and relatively new. I must say that the M130 is worth the purchase. To Robert from GA, I'm not so sure that shaving your arm hair is the most sanitary culinary practice. Better stick to the tomatoes."
4,Review od Chef Choice M130,"Pro - Quiet. Very good sharpner. Use positions 1 and 3 for normal kitchen knifes, J.A. HENCKELS. Position 1 - diamond wheel, for very dull blades. Position 3 - synthetic wheel, use after every knife use to maintain sharpness.3 year warranty.Con - expensive"
5,A review of Chef's sharpening center,"I, in times past, purchased various sharpening systems none of which, no matter how much time or energy expended, ever produced a sharp edge anywhere approaching the original factory edge. This Chef's sharpening system produces quickly and easily an edge comparable or better than the original factory edge. I would highly recommend this to anyone spending time in the kitchen."
4,Like having new knives ...,Better even. Most of my knives are now sharper than when they were taken out of their packaging. We bought this after I decided that I wanted some higher quality knives. My husband wanted to be able to keep the blades sharp after the investment in the knives. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Sharpening to a razor edge,"I was not expecting such a large item and that is my only complaint. My knives have never been dull but, compared to what I have now, they sure seem that way."
5,Excellent sharpener,This knife sharpener is worth the investment. It is easy to use and can quickly restore the sharp edge on even the dullest knife.
2,Chef's Choice M130,"Not as good as advertised. It takes a long long time to sharpen any knife on this unit. I was dissapointed and it sits in the drawer unused. Buy something else, this is not the one."
4,Just what they wanted.....,"My men folk had been wanting a better, easier sharpening method. They are in the middle of hunting season and a sharp knife is a must!!! (I also sneak my kitchen knives in with their pile.) Well, this is perfect!! They love it...and so do I !!!!"
1,"It works, but use with caution.","I used it, but it removes more material than necessary. If you have a good sharpening stone you can do much better with a small amount of practice. I sharpen knives, axes, chisels and saws. I would NEVER use it on one of my good knives costing more than $20.00....."
2,Average Knife Sharpener Over Priced,"The title say's it all, AVERAGE electric knife sharpener at OVER PRICE. I should have paid more attention to the other 3 star reviews of this product. I will KEEP this product only because my other electric sharpeners I have burned out and I don't have the time to research electric knife sharpeners. My advice to any one looking to purchase an electric knife sharpener is go to any discount store and buy any one of the many available off the shelf. Maybe someday soon a LASER sharpener will become available for home use."
4,Knife Sharpner,I suggest reading the instructions before attempting to sharpen any knife. The M130 sharpen my eight kitchen knifes as advertised with no problem. Not sure how the M130 would hold up under heavy use.
4,I like it,"I have always had a 'problem sharpening my knives. I tried steel, ceramic, wetstone, even a Dremel tool. The best was the Dremel, but then...... My son bought me a diamond sharpenin gadget, so, so. He also bought a shushi knife, wow, that is sharp. I tried, but never succeded to get an equal edge. Alas, come the 130, and now I can compete, on the first trial. Razor sharp in no time!! Thank you."
1,Be careful,"DO NOT buy this product if you live outside the USA, or if where you live uses a different electrical system to the 120V used in the US. I made the mistake of assuming that because Amazon stated quite clearly that this product shipped internationally, and they happily sent it to me, that it would be suitable for use in my country with a 240V system. The plug would not fit into the electrical outlet and even if it had, plugging it in and turning it on would have blown the appliance's motor. Amazon should include this kind of information in the specs on the appliance, or else not ship it to a country where it won't work. Whilst I have received a refund, I am still substantially out of pocket, as Amazon have only refunded a very small portion of the cost of posting it back to them. An expensive lesson learned. That being said, I have since bought this machine locally, and it is absolutely wonderful. My knives and the knives of family and friends have never been sharper."
1,The Best Sharpener is Knife Solutions,"After using wands and electric sharpeners (this one is bulky), neither which sharpened my knife consistently every time, I bought a Knife Solutions sharpener which gave a perfect edge (and great for easy and fast edges), even to my decade-old steak knives. It has an added safety/health bonus in that it magnitizes the shavings so no metal gets into your food. Awesome if you have health issues."
2,just not worth the cost,this product just does not do what it was intended to do as well as the cost should make it do.i am certainly not happy with the outcome.
1,Utter junk,"I've been a tool maker for 50 years.Thought this woud make sharpening easier and better.Wrong! Silliest 130 bucks I ever spent. Item is, in my oonion, worth nothing. Can't even do a pocket knife."
5,Do you want razor sharp knives?,"This sharpener does an absolutely GREAT job sharpening any knife. All of my knives are now sharper then when they were new, even sharp enough to shave with. No regrets from this buyer!"
5,An excellent sharpener.,"I have sharpened knives ever since I was a teenager. Now in my seventies I have learned there really is a better and easier way. The manual is well written and I would suggest that you read it first to determine the kind of sharpness you desire. I have learned that for me, I like a knife that has the micro edges that are produced by using a steel for the cutting that I do in the kitchen. This sharpener does it quickly and easily. For my hunting knife I want it to be able to shave the hair off my arm, and again it does it so easily. I am not saying that I can't produce the same degree of sharpness with my stone and steel. What I am saying is now I can do it in 5 minutes.Seymour Pelton"
4,Excellent.,I researched knife sharpeners for about one year before I bought this one. I'm happy with my purchase. You can make knives scary sharp with this device. I followed other reviewers recommendations to read the manual carefully. A little practice and you can create a very sharp knife. I can't say much more about this knife sharpener without some sort of scientific apparatus to measure how sharp is very very sharp.
5,9th Da IIIest!!!,"True School HipHop From Start To Finish!!!! Illmatic Beats, Dope Rhymes, Straight Classic Hiphop Sound all the way Through, 9TH wONDER IS A BEAST! COP IT!"
5,"HIP HOP IS STILL ALIVE, WELL AT LEAST ON THIS ALBUM",FIRST EVER REVIEW FELT COMPELLED TO WRITE THIS I WILL KEEP THIS SHORT THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE JUSTOUS LEAUGE HAS REALLY TALENTED MC MAKING GOOD MUSIC ALSO TRY KENN STARR (STAR STATUS)
4,Back to the Basics,"There was a time where all you needed was a good beat and some good lyrics, you know, nothing fancy, no thumping beat, no crew with 40+ posses, no beef of the week, none of that glitter, no cribs with chicks packed in every rooms, just a solid production, that sets the mood, but lets you focus on the lyrics. Nowadays everything is drawn into a whole lot of nada, and every cat sounds the same as the next one.Skyzoo brings it back to the essentials, with real lyricism and honest, honed and introspective story-telling. And if it wasn't good enough, 9th wonder brings some quality, soulful and sample-driven productions.It's refreshing to hear a sound that embraces the best of the 90s, the beautiful sound of the golden era, when NY was the mecca, and it was all about the lyrics.The real Rotten Apple, sure to put you in a NY state of mind."
3,Mediocre and overpriced condenser mic,"I owned this mic for five years before it blew some condenser and the recording volume started to oscillate. I have been using the mic mostly for recording vocals and it proved a little too sensitive for that purpose. If you are planning to record ambiance, or vocals with a lot of room sound, this mic could work for you. But for recording clean vocals it picks up a little too much room for my taste.So I recently replaced this mic with a second hand R0DE NT2000 (for under $400), and I think it is a much better investment of $$. See the reviews for NT2000 for more information on that mic."
2,"OK, but ...","I'll keep this short. Not knowing much about neuroscience, I'll assume the science in this book is ok. That said, what's NOT ok is Damasio's sense of the ethical. Too often (especially when he's trying to recover Spinoza) Damasio argues that the self is the starting place for ethics and ethical action, and while this may fit his argument, it seems like a dangerous road to tread. If the twentieth century taught us anything, let's hope that it taught us that the we are called to the ethical by the other, not the self."
5,too easy,couldn't have been easier. exact fit replacement part. took less than 20 min to remove and replace and now it works like a champ!
5,A wonderful book!,"I don't think you can find a more practical guide. It helped me think through a lot of issues.Especially helpful after you've been through McKee, Seger, Field, Cowgill, and all the other standards."
5,Absolutely great book,"When ordering several books on screenwriting this book caught my eye because of the high ratings afforded it by others. After reading it I fully concur with what others had to say. I went out and purchased DVDs of the four main example films (The Verdict, Terminator, Sleepless in Seattle, and Witness) that Mr. Lucey focuses on and they allowed me to pick up the fine points described in the text. His vast experience in script writing shows through in each of the topics discussed. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. For a detail-oriented individual such as myself, this book met all my expectations. If you are interested in this topic, this book is a ""must have"" by all means."
5,Add this book to your Screenwriting bookshelf,"Mr. Lucey has done an excellent job in breaking down the steps of writing a screenplay. Most of us handle the job of writing on an intuitive basis, not realizing the process we go through in developing the story.This book clearly explains that process, giving many examples from popular movies. It is a book that has such a wealth of information, you will want to read it more than once. It will be a dog-eared reference tool that you utilize for many years."
3,Not what I was expecting,I got a great price on these here on Amazon which was good beacause if I had paid regular price for these I would definitely return them. They are a custom fit but in my opinion still don't fit perfectly. I trimmed the passenger side to make it fit like I wanted it. The anchors screw into the carpet to hold it down and leave holes in the carpet so make very sure you get it where you want it the first time. These mats are pretty well designed but could be better in my opinion.
2,Not so great,"We purchased these for our SUV and were disappointed. If we had to do over again, we would purchase Huffy liners like we have for our truck."
4,Customer Friendly,Very informative and easy to use - and I used it to find the religious reference to my new grandson's name.
2,"I Love Christmas, but...","When I buy a Christmas book I usually expect some of the traditional miracles. This usually includes boy finding girl, some sort of tragedy and they find their way back together. This book included that, but sent you way out on a limb. The story began very sweetly but becomes somewhat far fetched toward the middle. I love Christmas more than anyone but this was just too far out there for me. The best part of the book though is the very end. If you can make it through the middle you will love the conclusion."
2,a formulaic Christmas tale that doesn't deliver,"This would have made a sweet short story, but as a novel it's a predictable tale that doesn't take the reader anywhere close to the ""Magic of Christmas"". Even the names of the characters (Noella Wright -- ""Miss Wright"" and Tom Douten -- ""Doubting Thomas"") are so contrived -- the author doesn't require much of the reader to figure out what's going to happen here.My book club chooses a book with a holiday theme each December -- I guess we've run out of the better titles. If you're looking for holiday reading, try ""The Christmas Box"" or ""The Christmas Wish"" instead."
2,The Santa Story,"I read this book because I thought it was a Christian Christmas romance. It's a romance set during the Christmas season, but to my surprise, it didn't even talk about Christmas being Jesus's birthday. Instead, this author (who also penned the Left Behind series) wrote a book about believing in Santa Claus. What the world doesn't need is another book or movie about Santa Claus. Christmas isn't about Santa Claus, it's about the miracle of the birth of Christ. The book was laid out with big print and big margins and was a fast read, but don't expect to find any theological messages."
5,Get swept up in the Christmas Magic,"Okay, when Christmas comes around, most people think of the mob scene that is Christmas shopping. However, in this easy, fun, and over-much-too-soon read, the spirit and the miracle of Christmas can be lived. The story of Noella and Tom is destined to become a classic, even though I don't believe that it's well-know as of yet. Hopefully that will change. Anyway, this is truly a great read and I hope that you will enjoy it too."
1,bad in every possible way,"Our family usually reads a book together at Christmas; my mother found this monstrosity in a Christian book store... we only finished it because we all found it so hilariously bad. One of my favorite lines is 'to others it may have looked like a casual kiss, but he knew how she really felt when she brushed his lips with her tongue."" The whole book is filled with this sort of clumsy writing. This book might be worth a penny just for the amusement, but how it was every published is beyond me. I mean-- the main characters' names are Tom Douten (perhaps.. could this mean... ""doubting Thomas""?) and Noella Wright. Please."
3,"kind of cute, but...","Okay, credit to the author for a novel idea and a cute storyline that tries to make believers out of all of us. In the tradition of Richard Evans and other simple-plot writers, this is a neat little love story with a Christmas theme. I read it in about an hour and found the story charming. On the other hand, the writing is mundane, the characters' thoughts spelled out to the nth degree (she wanted to kiss him, he wanted to see her...) to the point that it almost took the magic out of the story. At times it felt like a poor version of writer's workshop. Still, the story has merit and I don't think the author aspired to great literary heights -- I apologize if I'm being too harsh, but the writing just wasn't as good as the idea. If you want a quick read and an inspiring love story, you won't regret it, but if you're looking for literature, you have the wrong book."
5,BUY THIS BLADE IF YOU WISH TO WIN,THIS IS TH BEST BLADE IN THE WORLD IT IS WORTH THE MONEY YOU CAN BEAT THE HECK OUT OF EVERYBODY YOU FIGHT IT IS THE BEST. BUY THIS FOR A STARTER YOU WILL RULE . LET IT RIP
4,Its an ok blade.,"It works trust me get it.Still a little expensive I would wait till it goes down in price,one down side though you cant notice the effect of controling it right or left.Get it if you want to win Let it rip!!"
1,It was a deception!!!!!,It was really frustating for me and my litle son. I bought it at amazon.com site. It took about 10 days to get in my house because I live outside US and when my son tried to play it was not working. What about the QC of this toy? is it a joke! As I live outside US I can't exchange it. But the worth is the frustation of my kid. This Mastecard can not afford!
1,Not even worth $10,"This is the first review I've ever written, but I have to tell everyone that this is the crappiest toy I have ever seen. It didn't even work the way it was supposed to once. My son tried to play with it, very carefully I might add, and it still fell to pieces. I now have to find a time that he's not around so that I can throw it in the trash. Seriously, don't buy this toy. I would give it 0 stars if it would let me. I can't believe that anyone gave it a good review."
3,Not Totally Happy,"Putting this toy together is not nearly as difficult as some on here would have you believe. The directions are just simple pictures that show you what needs to be connected to what and don't give written instructions, but you shouldn't need them since the pieces are clearly labeled and connect with the other piece with the same label. It took me about 20 minutes to put it together.My 3 year old loves it, but after about a week of use, we are starting to notice a problem. The point where the car does the 180 and spins around seems to have become a problem spot. For some reason, both of the cars we use on the track reach this point but only do a 90 degree turn and then stop. It seems like the vertical descent isn't quite enough at this point to keep the vehicle moving. I'm going to try some silicon spray and/or some graphite to keep the friction down at this point and see how it works.If it wasn't for this problem, I'd be giving this 4 or 5 stars."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this.,"First let me say, I grew up playing with Mattel toys. Whatever they have done is a crying shame. I read the reviews on this toy and against my better judgement I bought it for my son. You can't imagine how excited he was to see this under the tree.We put it together two days later and one of the reviews said to use ""older"" batteries with this. It didn't matter if the batteries were old or new the car wouldn't go through the rubber tires. I'm sorry it did go through and it just bumped back against them. The thing had no power to push the car up the track.I took it apart and put it back together to make sure I didn't mess up and still it didn't work. I'm appaled that Mattel even is selling this garbage to kids. What happened to the days when making kids happy was more important then just making a dollar.Stay away from this toy. It's not worth the money you spend on it. My son ended up disappointed instead of happy. Thanks Mattel."
1,Didn't even work,"We tried several different sets of batteries and couldn't even get the thing to come on. Maybe just a lemon. But after reading the bad reviews on other aspects of the product, I think I will exchange this for something else instead of getting another. Very dissapointing for my young son since he couldn't even try it."
2,Disappointed,"I brought home this toy for my two boys and used my college degree putting it together. It comes with one Lightning McQueen car and the others must be purchased separately for around $3-4. No problem, right? Wrong! You can't find these toys! Evidently the cars are so scarce that they are going for $30+ on ebay! Not only that, while my boys love the toy and are pretty good about turning it off while not playing with it, they had some friends over to play and they ran it for about 15 minutes continuously. It burned up the motor! We've only had it a week! I gave it two stars because the cars themselves seem to be well built, and my kids truly love this toy, it's just not a quality product."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This toy is very cheap for the price you pay. My son got it for one of his birthday gifts, and it was nothing but a waste of our money. It falls apart all the time, you can't even move it without it falling apart. It's a pain to put it back together, especially if it's sat around for awhile, because you can't remember how it goes back together. I wouldn't even give this toy a one star it deserves a big fat ZERO! But of course 1 star is the lowest you can give. Don't waste your money on this toy!"
1,Not worth it one bit,"The track comes apart too easy, the cars do not go all the way around the track, it eats up batteries, it falls apart every time I move it, my 5 and two year olds play with it for a few minutes then remember why they don't like playing with and leave it alone."
3,"Difficult assembly, still fun.","Despite the difficult assembly, this track is still fun. My 4 year old CARS-enthusiast received this for his birthday, and he loves it. It works best with the one car it came with: Lightning McQueen. The McDonald's Happy Meals Cars will not fit this track, due to the width. Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars may be the right width, however, they are too heavy for the special spin out trick (rememember Doc's advice from the movie?), a Matchbox convertible does better, possibly because of the decreased weight of the car. Still, my son and I have fun starting the cars on the ""spin out"" and then ""helping"" them by catching them on the return to the ""spin out"" and guiding them back down to the motorized booster. Also, the included Lightning McQueen car fits in the Mack Truck, as well."
2,Radiator Springs,"What a piece of JUNK. It was the only thing on my 4 year old's list to Santa. Took too long to put together, and it snaps apart too easily. False advertising too, it says you can put other Cars vehicles on this thing? We have every plastic, diecast, even odd ball Pixar car vehicles and nothing but the car that comes with the track works on it. Don't waste your money."
4,Mountain Challenge fun,"My 4 year old son jumped for joy when he opened this gift and exclaimed ""It's just what I wanted!"" It was easy to put together and he and his 7 year old brother are having a blast racing the cars around the track. I am giving this 4 stars only because it has been difficult finding the other Cars cars that are supposed to be available. The ones that I have found, Chick, Lawless, Nitroade, do not always stay on the track through the first curve."
4,Neat track!,"My 5-year-old son loves playing with this race track. I can't say I had any fun putting it together, but that's typical of toy race tracks. The only problem may be that the wagon wheel doesn't seem to turn on its own. Also, it would be nice to have other Cars characters to drive on it that are the same weight as the one that came with it, but I can't seem to find any. The die cast models don't work as well."
2,Don't Bother,"This item is completely useless. Assuming the car stays on the track, you place the car on the track and it goes around and round in circles. You can change which way it goes, but it is too fast to track so it's not even like watching a toy railroad. The child doesn't have to do anything but stare at it. My 3 year old turns it on, does it once, then leaves because there is really no ""playing"" with this toy!"
1,I should have paid attention.,I read the reviews for this product and thought it can't be that bad. It was. I have to think that the people who had positive experiences with this set had the few that were made to fit. The toy designers have to go back to the drawing board. My son was way disappointed. He wanted it so badly I and I wanted to give it to him. Oh well. I think we'll get something more reliable.
2,Yard Sale It - More Than 1 Car Doesn't Work At A Time,"""Santa"" gave this to our son this Christmas, and I (his father) was nearly as excited as he was. However, after spending nearly an hour making sure I put it together correctly, we were both disappointed to find that only 1 car can run on it at a time, and *occassionally* one car will make it all the way around. Sally works best. The Lightning McQ that came with it worked great originally, but doesn't make it all the way around.The only ""Challenge"" (as the name states) is trying to get two to stay on the track at the same time. We've tried a number of the cars and a bunch of 'timing' to get two cars to run, but no luck. If anyone figures it out - please post!Will probably end up yard-sale-ing it in the summer -- what a bummer."
3,"Poor workmanship, false advertising","My son received this toy for Christmas. Santa says it went together easily. It doesn't fall apart like some are describing, but it does move out of position and unhook at the bottom and my son has to ask for help to fix it because it has a lot of movable parts and is not easy to fix for a 5 year old. It is noisy and that's annoying. The biggest disappointment is that the cars which are sold to go with this set of ""Radiator Springs"" product do not work on it. Even the cars which are PICTURED ON THE BOX ON THE TRACK do not work on it, except the McQueen car which comes with it. I cannot believe they tested this before they released it. All of the engineering which had to go into this and they could't make more of the cars work on it? I rate it a 3 because he does play with it despite its faults, as a parent consumer however, thumbs down."
1,Not worth your time or money,"Reading the other reviews, I can't understand how anyone could like this product. Putting it together was nearly impossible with the terrible instructions, and the pieces didn't go together very well(some, not at all). Once together, it didn't work. The car hasn't even made it around the track once, despite my son's best efforts. Don't waste your time, money, or energy on this inferior waste of a product."
1,a piece of junk,"I got this for the holiday for my son last year. We threw it out shortly after. It falls apart easily and makes a lot of noise. The most enjoyment he got out of this piece of junk was taking all of the pieces I spent forever putting together apart. I can NOT believe this thing has went up to nearly $80 in price. That is out of control! I probably spent $25 last year, and THAT wasn't even worth it. Seriously people, do not waste your money on this thing."
1,Terribly disappointing!!!!!!,"My son got this as a gift and it was hard to put together and even harder to KEEP together!! It's flimsy and the cars keep falling off of the track. It's annoyingly loud too. My son kept asking me to put it back together approximately every 5 minutes! Needless to say, I threw it out with the rest of the garbage! Good riddance."
2,Kids love parents don't,"The track did not assemble as it should. The parts didn't fit right and caused the whole track to be off. Several people tried putting it together so this is not one person's opinion but several. Kids loved it even though it didn,t stay together well and the cars didn't stay on the track."
1,"If I could give it no stars, I would.","This toy is the poster child for manipulative corporate greed.The playset is obviously designed to only look good from the angle it was photographed from. Don't be fooled, it's all facade, no substance.It is flimsy, and the cars do not go around the track properly. The ""Wagon wheel"" which is supposed to be a ""see if your car can get through"" kind of challenge, always swings around to block the car unless you are actually HOLDING it.I'm glad that there were a few reviews that said their child liked it, but mine became bored with it after 5 minutes of it NOT working right, and went back to his simpler hot wheels figure-8 track. And he LOVES the movie, so that's saying soemthing.Don't buy it. It's a waste of plastic."
4,worked well for us,"Although this took about 30 to 45 minutes to set up, it has not fallen apart at all after lots of playing time. Our kids have really enjoyed playing with it, ages 4, 5, and 9. My husband did not want to buy this after reading all the reviews, but for us it turned out to be a fun toy!! Our 5 year old boy especially likes it. The character car Sally works as well as the Lightining McQueen that comes with it. The sheriff is too heavy, he makes it up the hill and stops. Luigi, Ramone and Sarge don't work either. Batteries still working well after 4+ hours of play. I would recommend this toy, just make sure you put it together correctly."
4,GREAT GIFT,"Santa got this for my son and he loves it, I dont have any problems with it at all. Easy to put together had it together in 20 minutes."
1,My kid won't stop crying,"Please don't buy this toy. It was very difficult to put together, poorly designed, flimsy, will eat batteries, has an annoying sound, and is generally a huge waste of money. My 5-year old lost interest quickly and my 2 year found it so frustatingly flimsy that he wouldn't stop sceaming and crying. Also note that unless you throw it away (thereby granting yourself peace and salvation), it will take up a lot of space because you will be unwilling to disassemble and then reassemble it at a future time."
2,Very disappointing for the price,"My 4 year old son received this as a birthday present. My husband and I worked together for about an hour to get it together but we were able to do it. When we turned it on for the first time everyone was very excited. It worked great and my son was having a great time putting all of the cars in his collection in and watching them shoot around - we thought it was great!!! THEN...after a few rounds of playing (within the same day) pieces of the track started coming disconnected. No problem we just put them back. Then every minute or so my son was calling us to put it back together. This toy is a great idea but not well executed, especially for the near $40 price. We put the toy in the closet while we had company in the house and haven't taken it out yet. We are trying to decide what to do with it. Overall I was very disappointed and sorry that his grandmother spent the money on a toy that just isn't well made."
1,Poor choice,This toy was disapointing! I purchaced one for my son and one for my nephew for a total of $[...] waisted. The toy took a long time to put together and fell apart continously. The boys were delighted for about 15 minutes after wiating an hour or more for assembly and before it broke. Poorly made very cheap.
5,Entertainment for days!,"I did not put this together, but I'm told it was pretty easy. Once up and running, so were we. My five year old son spent almost an entire day ""charting"" which Radiator Springs resident ran the track the best. We then spent the next two days at tryouts for the rest of his Hot Wheels/ Matchbox collection. He really likes the ""tipper"" that gently dumps a car from the track and the spin out at the curve. I'm surprized that it hasn't come apart like so many other racetracks, and that it has captivated him so. We are continuing our test runs with other materials too, like marbles and superballs. Neat."
4,"When it works, it's cool!","My son really likes this game. The only problem we have with it is that if the track is not just right, the car won't go all the way around, but it is pretty cool when it works. We've added some tape to keep the track just right. Some of the other cars work too, like Sally."
3,An Ok toy,"My three year old son received this as a Christmas present. At first, he played with it a lot, then grew tired of it. Lightning McQueen drives around in circles and occassionally falls off. Thats about all it does."
2,Great . . . for a few days,"I have a 3 & 4 year old that reeeeeeally wanted this for Christmas. They LOVED playing with it for 4-5 days, but that's when it started having problems. First, the wheels that shoot the cars around the track started getting off track, causing friction, thus it couldn't get the power it needed to shoot the cars up and around the track anymore. Several times my husband took that part apart to fix it, and it worked fine for awhile, then it'd start all over again. Currently, besides that happening, the track mis-aligned somehow, so one part of the ramp is too high, another too low, etc. The cars can't move around it properly. Also, only certain cars (one comes with it) have the right weight and size to work on the ramp . . . no Hot Wheels. Overall, my kids played with it for hours at a time before it started having problems----now (only a few weeks later) it is in a non-functioning heap in the playroom. In hindsight . . . not a wise purchase."
3,There is a reason they call this a mountain challenge,This product was a little over rated in my opinion. This was one of the only things that my son stated that he had to have for Christmas. It was hard to assemble and is not much bang for the buck.
4,Pretty cool,"Instructions and putting together pretty easy, had a little trouble, but it was easy to re-do the one connection we had wrong. The car does continuously go around and around, only occaisionly stops in the big curve, but this may be intentional....and it is realistic. It is fairly noisy. Not sure what the stick next to the wheel is supposed to do, my child didn't want the wheel to interfere with McQueen's jumps, so we made it stationary."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this product for my son for Christmas. It is a cute concept however the product falls apart alot and the car doesnt stay on the track that often. I thing it would be a good toy with a few adjustments.
2,It's ok.,"It's a ""so-so"" comedy. There is a well-shot scene on a canal in Copenhagen, but overall it's nothing special. For completists only."
3,"INGMAR BERGMAN, OPUS 14","*** 1954. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. A comedy for adults as the introduction says. After 15 years of marriage, Marianne and David Erneman hardly lives together anymore but one day David decides to leave his mistress and to reconquer Marianne. Three major feminine figures gravitate round David -Gunnar Björnstrand- Erneman : his wife played by the sublime Eva Dahlbeck, his daughter played by the juvenile Harriet Andersson and at last his mistress impersonated by the venenous Yvonne Lombard. If this comedy of manners is interesting, it can't be compared with works of the same period likeSawdust and Tinsel - Criterion CollectionorSummer Interlude (Sommarlek) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Great Britain]. A movie for the curious ones."
5,La crme de la crme...,"This is THE dictionary. If you are studying law or you are a translator (which is my case) in search of the best dictionary , cease looking, this is the book for you. I'm 100% sure it will never let you down. One last piece of advise: don't be cheap and buy the deluxe edition, it's black hardcover looks great in your bookshelf...."
2,Not the original Buzz,"My son, who loves Toy Story and will be Buzz for Halloween, got this for his birthday and was sorely disappointed. I didn't pay any attention when I bought it and never realized it was not the original with the flip out wings, the correct colors (green and purple) and the voice that says ""to infinity and beyond"". He knew instantly that it wasn't ""the Real Buzz"" and cried. The jet pack wouldn't stay on his back and the missle disappeared within minutes. (The shooting missle is not really appropriate for a 3 yr old anyway). I immediately packed it back up with all those twist ties and took it back to Toy R Us. Then I went over to the Disney store at the mall and bought the ""Original Buzz"" (it even says it on the box) for the same price. If you don't have a Disney store near you, the original Buzz is on sale online at Disneystore.com for $14.99. Buy that instead of this imitation!"
3,disappointed with shipping,"I thought the toy was great, and my son loves it. The arms are kind of hard to move, but other than that it's made well and my kids are very satisfied. The shipping is what disappointed me, when i got it the chest was rubbed off by the box. I would recommend packing it better."
4,BUZZ,"My 3 year old daughter loves this toy, other than the fact it doesn't ""fly"", it's still her favorite toy. I am happy with Buzz because my daughter's eyes light up each time you mention Buzz. She's happy, I'm happy."
5,Charles' mega book,"Dear Readers,Earth Geeks Must Go is a super-gross book. Some gross things are people eating from their armpits. Bugs that can talk to people.It has people who can take their heads off. It also has people who go from one wierd planet to another.READ THIS BOOK."
3,christmas,Good idea but doesn't seem very durable. Must make sure you press down the pieces hard to make contact with the board sensors. Think this is for 13 and above crowd.
2,Too bad I purchased this. Not worth the $ spent.,The talking feature of the unit is useless. You can't understand the words. The pieces are too small and too lightweight. Non magnetic. It would be better if the board was magnetic. A poor purchase on my part.
2,Talking Chess Trainer,I never got the chance to use the product. I could not get it to function properly from the get go so I returned it for a refund. I have since ordered a different brand computer chess which has not been delivered yet.
5,Twisted,I love how Season 1 and 2 are so incredibly different. It's nice to see the characters and storyline develop. Lots of movement and progression in this show.
5,Magical!!!,"This show is simply amazing. Once upon a time is enjoyable of all ages. It manages to blend real life and the imaginary in a way that still makes sense. One of my favorite things is that they can twist the stories we all knew and loved growing up into their own versions without upsetting viewers to the point that we want to stand up, draw the line and cry ""You sir, have gone too far!!!""."
4,Light and fun,This show is mindless fun...a fairy tale soap opera. It is fun and interesting and I love the characters. This season is as good as the first.
4,Good clean entertainment for the entire family,"The concept of this show is very compelling if you like science fiction. This show is good clean entertainment for the whole family. Rumpelstiltsken is perhaps the most interesting character on the show and is defintely one of the corner stones to its success. We started watching season 1 on Netfilx, then picked up the missing season 2 episodes on Amazon Prime. We are now all caught up and have it set on the DVR."
5,GREAT SHOW,"Great show for everyone to enjoy! Set between the fairy-tale world and the small, real-world town of Storybrook. Good acting, writing, and screenplay, as well as a compelling plot. Recommend to anyone who enjoys fairy tale/fantasy television!"
5,A Twisted Fairy Tale,"If you loved ""Once Upon a Time"" season 1, then you have to watch this. The stories and characters are still good and more fairy tales are being woven into the story. Wow, how intricate can this series get? If you haven't seen the first season, I recommend you start from the beginning. Otherwise, you won't know what is going on, who everyone is, and how they know each other."
4,Love this Show,In season 2 they continued the thrill ride of fairytale inspired deadly situations. Hope they continue for many seasons to come.
5,Fun Series!,"My daughter missed Season 2 while away at Army Basic Combat Training. She sat and watched the entire thing over her Christmas Leave from training. The Second Season starts a little slow, but gets better & better as it goes on."
5,Love It,"Love it, this show reminds you of your child hood. A twist to the original stories. The End THE End"
5,Once Upon A Time,"I just love this show. It is so entertaining, and I always can't wait for the next show to air. I am addicted. The whole cast is awesome."
5,Fantastic Fantasy,The Once Upon a Time Series is a journey into our childhood fantasies but with an adult twist. Here all of your fairy tales and other childhood fiction characters come to life with never a dull moment. I love the way the different stories are interwoven and the split between modern life and the world of make believe add contrast. Season II is as exciting and suspensefull as season I. I can't wait for more
5,love it,"Big Doctor Who and fantasy fan, I'd highly recommend it! Not all that great for children though, my son says it's ""a little scary."""
5,great show,"I am hooked. I can't wait for the next show. I just started watching after buying the first season, And had to catch up on the second. Will evenyually buy the second season when it is over and released to video."
4,Great fun,"Yes it's a bit silly and purely escapism, but this series offers fun and flights of imagination. What if those familiar fairy tale, mythological, and legendary characters were alive and living somewhere in Maine? This isn't great cinema, but many viewers will enjoy the what.if element of each episode."
5,Awesome series,If you loved Heroes or Firefly... You will love this. See Disney characters--both villairns and heroes in a whole new light. A marvelous mixture of fantasy and the real world.
4,So far so good.,"If you ever wanted to watch a prime time soap opera aboutpublic domain fairy-tale characters then well this is the showfor you.It was created by some ""Lost"" writers and though it has Hugoplaying a giant and has some purple smoke and flashbacksit's no Lost."
3,Did not enjoy as much as Season 1,"For some reason, Season 2 left us feeling flat compared to Season 1. Maybe the concept of the show got old to us, but we stopped watching after a couple of episodes."
5,Great series!,"Didn't know whether they could keep the storyline interesting after Season 1, but Season 2 is also great. Can't wait to see what happens in Season 3!"
5,best tv show I've seen in years! it truly has me hooked,best tv show I've seen in years! it truly has me hooked to the point I've been paying just so I can watch the next episode
5,Great continuation of Season 1,We love this series. The story lines continue from the first series with enough of a resolve to satisfy but always a great teaser to get you to come back. Can hardly wait for the next episode.
5,Great Show for Family,This is one I really enjoy watching with my ten year old daughter without worrying if its appropriate. We are both hooked on it.
4,My Fav Show!,I love the show!! I HATE that I bought it and it takes so dang long to download it to the app- I can only watch it if i have service of wifi.
5,Once,"So glad they made this show!! It's awesome! The plot definitely keeps me guessing and it's clean, which is nice in this day and age"
4,Second Upon a Time,"If for no other reason, this show is well worth the time and purchase just to watch Robert Carlyle transform from facet to facet as his character demands. He is the show as every other character is anchored by his performance. Not as manaic a perfomance as he gave in Train Spotting, but then again, we don't want him to be too scary."
5,I love this show,"This review duplicates the one I wrote for Revenge. I love this show and I love being able to watch it commercial free. I've given up expensive TV cable/dish providers. I stream Netflix, Amazon, and other free channels with my Roku device and laptop. I dread the day our internet charges sky rocket because the cable/dish providers start noticing the money they are losing because of streaming."
2,Once Upon A Time Season 2,Love Love Love the show....Hate the streaming interruptions and delays. We have no trouble streaming from Netflix!Thank You
2,Not as good as season 1,"Leave it to the guys from Lost to ruin a good premise... Season 1 was wonderful and magical, and then Season 2 just felt like they ran out of storyline and were stalling and hoping no one would notice. Disappointing."
5,Love the show,awesome show! yes recommend this show to anyone. my 10 year old also enjoys it! Enjoy watching with the family.
5,One of the BEST shows on TV (& Amazon),"We were late and missed the first season on commercial TV, but once we started watching, to catch up, was a MUST! This series involves so many fairy tales we've all known, and intricately entwines it with a contemporary thread. Great writing! Awesome! I'm so glad we are able to ""catch up"" with the episodes we missed."
5,Best show ever,This is the best show i have seen in a very long time! It keeps the watcher on the edge of their seat the entire time and I can't wait to finish watching the rest of the show.
4,Fun and imaginative,Just a fun and imaginative take on our old fairy tales!! Enjoy it and see the new spin on old stories!
2,i just can't stand that blond woman,"the 1st season i was hooked, it was really really good, the second season, well, i just cannot take that blond woman's character, i cannot stand how she is over the top confident, true vomit material. i could not get past the 4th episode, the blond woman in the first season seemed to be more tolerable, maybe it was that i could kind of see why she had a chip on her shoulder. second season, just can't take no more"
3,Gushy like the fairy tales they are evoking,"I'm not a big fan of fairy tales but I enjoy the blending of reality and fantasy, plus it's nice to know a character a little bit by only hearing their name.My gripes with this show are the following:They keep trying to make this point that love conquers all but I know this isn't true but it's good to give into a fantasy every once in a while, right?The good characters in the story also keep treating these despicable characters with the utmost respect and kindness, possibly out of some hope in changing them but then they don't even try to help them to be better people which is a good reflection of modern society and how it has imperfectly accepted pacifism."
2,Man of Steel?,"""Steel"",the comic book clunker starring basketball player Shaquille O'Neal,would best be titled ""Steal"" because it manages tie together disparate quotes--FROM OTHER MOVIES. It even has the lead of ""Shaft"" make Shaft jokes(!!!) that aren't funny. O'Neal stars as a soldier whose buddy turns evil (Judd Nelson),and injures his friend Sparky (Sigourney Weaver lookalike Annabeth Gish) in the process. Unlike most superheroes, Steel doesn't become one until waaay late in the film. Luckily, Sparky gets a cool action sequence in which she blasts the bad guys with her weaponized wheel chair. That is an awesome scene. Steel blunders his way through it. This movie certainly heralded the end of comic book movies for a good long time,and for a good reason. It certainly wasn't comic. ""Steel"" only steals your time--which you can't get back."
4,So trite and predictable that it's good!,"I agree with the other reviewer in that one must look at this as a B-movie in order to assess it. Yes, the characters were one-sided, the plot was predictable, and everyone knew that the good guys were going to come out on top in the end, but it's still a pretty entertaining movie. And there's nothing wrong with that."
4,Enjoyable movie,"It's not the best movie out there, but it is better than a lot of the over-hyped crap Hollywood produces. It's got a decent story and a good theme. If I were a parent, this is a movie that I would like my child to watch. The action is good without it being graphic, and I don't recall a lot of (if any) profanity...which is pretty tiresome. I'm sick of movies where everyone is swearing. Watching this movie to the end might put you in a pretty good mood. The good guy cast I feel is actually portrayed well by the actors/actresses."
2,How to fix this movie,"Now I own some of the Steel comics and this movie is nothing like the comic books. It's not Shaq fault for this being a bad movie. If this movie was recast and a few elements removed it can be a decent movie. 1) Recast Steel-Steel in the comics is a genius and Shaq doesn't present that aspect to the viewer. Not Shaq's fault, but Lawrence Fisherburne or even Jaleel White could fit the role better. 2) No free throw references 3) Why is Ray J in the movie? Steel is closer to his neice than nephew. 4) there is no Steel (bat) cave. 5) Create a supervillian for Steel like the comic did. 6) Keep the soundtrack-which was the best thing about the movie."
2,Different product,"I ordered three Incipio Screen Protectors and for no reason they sent me three Inspire Screen Guard kits they should make clear first that they are gonna send you a different item, other than that the product works well however I don't like to receive a different brand of product."
5,Very useful,If yuur looking to provide some direct heat this is a great product. I don't like the automatic restart feature but other then that it works great
2,One of them don't fit,"These stands are supposed to be mirrored of each other, but not exactly identical. I got the exactly identical two, so one of them don't actually fit. I just did the best that I can to attach it under my heater. They are cheaply made by plastic, and $15 is way over price. I don't think that you need them, because they are going to melt, if the heater is so hot. Just waste of money!"
3,"OK, but not metal","Units were nice but plastic, compared to metal legs on old heater. Concerned about durability. Work ok foro now. Good Fit"
2,Made in China!,"Yes! It's dishwasher safe, it's heavy and shiny BUT the set has been poorly made. If you look at the spoons for example, you wont see smooth curves at all. I wonder if it's the quality of Lenox in general or it's because it is made in China!"
4,very good stuff a must have,"this is a great album-- it starts off great--""my eyes are black and white""--classica standout would definately be the track with the live srum samples"
5,Where have they been all my life?,"I first heard of Fleetwood Mac when they reunited for The Dance and tour. Seeing a video for Silver Springs made me go buy the cd. And am so glad I did. It had all the old stuff and the new stuff, but it was all new to me. I loved it so much that I started buying the old stuff like Rumours. WOW, that record blew my mind. And I still love Fleetwood Mac and I contribute that to The Dance. Now, with their renewed energy, will the five continue, or leave us again?"
3,Doesn't translate well on audio cd.,"The Dance by Fleetwood Mac was probably one of the best concerts ever but the final product doesn't sound so great on an audio cd. Standout live tracks include: Silver Springs, You Can Go Your On Way, You Make Loving Fun, Everywhere, Bleed To Love Her, and Don't Stop. I'm not sure if there is a way to buy the live concert on DVD but if there is I would go with that version instead."
1,Live music on CD's should be banned,"I bought this hoping to get the best Fleetwood Mac songs on one cd. The first song, ""The Chain"" came on and all you can hear is people screaming. I want to hear the song, not people screaming. Needless to say, I feel I wasted money. I will not listen to this cd again. Somewhere, in the cd description, they should have mentioned it was live. I would have saved money."
5,Incredible,"I had never heard of ""Fleetwood Mac"" back in 1997. I remember riding the bus home from track practice one afternoon and the radio was on playing ""Landslide."" My friend Pat and I agreed that the song was great, but we didn't know who sang it. At another time, with my mom, ""Landslide"" came on again and I asked her who it was, and she said ""Fleetwood Mac."" I told her I thought the song was great, and she bought me this CD. And it is amazing! I think it was the first CD i have ever had that I could really appreciate everysong, it was great. I have since bought several other ""Mac"" Cds, but this remains my No. 1, it may in fact be my favorite CD of all time. Do yourself a favor and get it for yourself, it is worth every penny."
5,Better than the Studio albums,Fleetwood Mac sounds better live than they do in the studio and this record proves it. You can really hear the raw intensity in the songs and the emotions the each members brings out. This is truly a special record and it's one of my favorite live albums of all time.
3,where's gold dust woman!,"I can't believe they excluded my favorite song, and probably the best example of what makes Stevie Nicks so special. Otherwise, The Dance has some terrific music (Landslide, Silver Springs, Tusk) and several duds (Temporary One, My Little Demon, Say You Love Me). Stevie and Lindsey sound great. Christine has a nice voice, but it's wasted here on not-so-great songs. I'd have rather heard her sing Songbird. Oh, and did I mention how sad it is that they excluded Gold Dust Woman!"
3,Aged Voices And A Few Bad Choices,"It's not a chore to tell you what's wrong with this album. I simply don't have enough time. With Buckingham's voice sounding like he's gasping for his last ounce of air and a few songs that were his and not the band's, I would say he's the reason this album isn't one of the greatest of all time. I'm not saying he's the only one with vocal changes; Christine McVie's voice has weakened a bit from what it was in her hey-day. We'll just put it short and simple. If they would have let Nicks carry the band, it would have been a sensation. She was wonderful. Silversprings, and Riannion (which was obviously, yet tastefully rearranged) will take you to a parallel universe from which you'll never want to return. Give it a listen before you run out and buy it, but definitely give it a listen."
4,Fleetwood Mac Attack,"I really enjoy live cds, as they show how the artist can handle a show setting, away from the studio, plus the audience interaction (which some people find annoying) I find exciting. It's the next best thing to actually being at the concert. Anyway, I have always been a Mac fan, and enjoy all their music, so when this album came out, I grabbed it. It is certainly not one of the best live albums I've heard, but for a tru Mac fan, I'm sure they will overlook the obvious flaws. The energy level is not as high as on other live albums, and their voices (quite naturally) do show their ages a bit. But who cares...Fleetwood Mac still, for the most part, have it, and this is an enjoyable listen."
4,Another great performance,"Fleetwood Mac gives their all in this spectacular set. My only complaint is that on the CD Lindsey Buckingham's accoustic version of ""Go Insane"" is not included(you can see it on the video). I realize this was one of his solo project songs, but his performance of ""Big Love"" and that sends chills down my back every time I watch it-the man is amazing(and the accoustic rendition of ""Go Insane"" is much better than the original). If you buy the CD you must get the video as well if only to see the interactions between Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham."
4,Ruined By Lindsay Buckingham Yelping,"Most of this is great, but we certainly don't need another live version of I'm So Afraid and we certainly don't need more grunts and groans from Lindsay Buckingham (you can get more than enough from Fleetwood Mac Live) - sure wish he would just sing instead of yelping all the time. Still pretty good."
4,Still Great After All These Years (with apologies to Paul Simon),"I saw the reunion performance of Fleetwood Mac on PBS many years ago and loved it. So I had to get this CD. I guess we have Bill Clinton to thank for reuniting the band when he chose ""Can't Stop (Thinkin' About Tomorrow)"" as his campaign theme. It isn't Fleetwood Mac's ""greatest hits"" but almost, and being a live performance has an energy that studio tracks just don't have. Also, the new songs are good, and the additional of the UC Marching Band is a hoot!"
5,A Desert Island Choice.,"I bought this disc when it first came out last century. I listen to it regularly and I'm still enjoying it more and more. It's an excellent recording which has new tracks fitting in absoultely beautifuly with the old tracks. It is impossible for me to critisize anything about this disc. Welcome back, Lindsey!I have many CDs that I refer to as my favourites - most of them containing a lot harder rock, but Fleetwood Mac's The Dance is easily my Desert Island Choice."
4,Haunting At Times,"I bought The Dance because of the song ""Silver Springs."" It's haunting lyrics and melody still get to me today, even though much time has passed since that song could rip me apart like it used to.To my delight, there were many other great songs on herem as well. In many ways, Anyone who has an especially close relationship with a parent eeds to hear ""Landslide"" at leas once.It's a beautiful CD overall."
5,Dated group still have it!,"Unlike the dated Mamas & Papa's, which I dearly loved way back when, it was pathetic when they came back and sang their old songs. Was not the same sound, Unlike the Fleetwood Mac group this CD was really great to hear especially several favorites of mine. They seemed fresh and still have a sound all their own, unlike a lot of newer groups and singers today who all have the ""same sound""... All I can say was I was delighted and and not at all disappointed."
4,A Touch of Magic in the Dance,"""The Dance"" is appropriately named; it makes my body and spirit dance at an upbeat, passionate yet steady tempo. The music flows like a river in perfect harmony with the lyrics. Lindsey Buckingham's and Stevie Nick's seductive voices can scarcely be beaten. There are traces of magic--""Welsh Witch Music""--throughout the album, notably in the songs of Stevie Nicks. I'd be hard pressed to pick out my favorite songs off of this album. This seventeen song treasure is definitely worth bringing into your home!"
2,The Dance is short five steps,"First of all I want to say I'm only giving this 2 stars based on the content which has been cut from the cd compared to the DVD. The DVD I give 5 stars, how could any ""Fleetwood Mac"" fan not, but as for the cd release what's going on? Even the song order is different on the cd, for those who are not aware the missing songs from the DVD they are ""Gold Dust Woman"", ""Go Insane"", ""Gypsy"", ""Over My Head"" and ""Songbird"". Now you can understand why I'm pissed, especially leaving out ""Gypsy"" and ""Songbird"". If anyone knows why please let me know. Apart from that this is a magnificent concert, let's just hope the full and correct order version will be released one day."
3,Buckingham is annoying,"His self-indulgent grunts, groans and shrieks ruined The Chain. Big Love, yeah, BIG HEAD. I only downloaded a few MP3's from the CD."
1,"Don't Buy this, You'll be Sorry you did!!!!!!!","Hello,I am writing this to everyone, to tell you not to buy this product. I bought it to back up my memory cards & free up some space, and ending up losing it ALL!!!! I have one card, that can no longer be used because of the corrupted files, which can't be deleted. And the other card, is now completely blank. I am telling you, from experience, don't buy this product.... You'll be as mad as I am now.P.S. - And all this happened within 3 minutes of using this product. My MR3 Files & VS Data, are all gone...."
1,Use at your own risk!,"The only thing i ended up with when i purchased the Max Drive is a corrupted memory card. Corrupted, as in completely destroyed, useless, lost all my games, throw the memory card on the ground and stomp on it. Actually, the Max Drive is the culprit. Here is my advice: if you need to delete any files from your PS2 Memory Card, do not do it through the Max Drive system disc!! Go into your playstation browser and delete each file directly from there. That is how my memory card got destroyed. I had the Max Drive in my hands for less than 2 minutes and it completely destroyed all the hard work/time i put into my games. not to mention now i have to buy another memory card.Also, first make a back up of ALL your games. Cuz they can all vanish into thin air, just like that! So people, buy at your own risk! I just paid Datel 30 bucks to ruin all my games."
1,"Bought it, within a few weeks it was DEAD","This came with the Action Replay CD for $39.99 (without tax). I don't think I was ever able to use it. It was good for the first couple of weeks, then it quickly acted up and now the PC can't even read it. The PC says the max drive is full and won't allow me to format it. I want to buy another one to replace my dead max drive, but my confidence has been shakened."
1,I wish i'd read these reviews sooner....,"I've used my max drive for a while with no problems, then today i was backing up some files to free up space on my memory card and - hey presto - my card says it has corrupted data and there's nothing i can do about.Apparently this is not unusual with many of Datel's products. A great way to destroy a perfectly good memory card and all your hard-earned game saves. Buy it for someone you particularly dislike, otherwise avoid like the ebola virus."
4,Septiderm-V Great For Many Uses,"I recently purchased Septiderm-V Antiseptic Skin Care Lotion from a veterinary supply company for use on my Samoyed's hot spots between ins hind legs. It is a good, inexpensive product that used in conjunction with bathing may help you avoid a trip to the vet. I have also recently used the product to clean the outer portion of Oliver's infected ears. It helped clean the fur surrounding his ears and gave off a pleasant scent to help mask the smell of the infection. It's a great multi-purpose skin care product and the price...at least from the vet supply company found on the web is great. Much better product than you can find at most pet stores."
5,A standard for any oboe player,"John Mack is definitely one of the pillars of the oboe playing world. His playing and teaching alike draw much praise. This CD is no expception. During his career, Mack has put out many definitive and emulated performances, and this CD contains many of the pieces standard in the oboe repetoire. In fact, some of these pieces are rarely recorded and can only be found on this CD. The Schumann Romances are beautifully done with excellent tone and phrasing, the Saint-Saens is wonderful and Mack's interpretation has become the standard for this sonata, the Hindemith is playful and quirky, and the Poulenc is pretty and well executed(though I prefer the Leleux interpretation). The little French pieces are pretty and a nice addition, though not that exciting.My one gripe is with the engineering which makes things sound a bit unbalanced and hollow at times. Nevertheless, the CD is very well done."
4,Pope fans rejoice,"PFR fans eager to see if Patrick Andrew could carry on the great tradition will likely be disappointed as this CD does not blaze new trails.However, Greg Pope fans who remember CDs like ""A Really Cool Sunshine"" where you can hear a metronone ticking in the background, will be pleasantly surprised with the professional quality of this CD. For example, the remake of ""Decide For You"" sounds more full and complete with improved backgrounds. This CD has a lot more edge than the Greg Pope Band, but is softer than Apple Green's ""Umbrella"". In general the CD is a step up for Greg Pope whose lyrics are theologically sound and views of grace are refreshingly simple.The songs written by Patrick Andrew are so deep you have to really listen to them carefully to get their full value. There is a big distinction between the styles of Pope and Andrew which gives the album some variety. However, the predictable guitar solos and sluggish nature of the CD is why I couldn't give it 5 stars."
3,NOT that BAD,"Well, here you have Patrick Andrew's project after PFR broke up, first of all you'll really miss PFR because Andrew's voice is really similar to Joel's. It has some crunchy guitars like PFR's ""pour me out"", its a good CD overall, the only bad thing is that its kinda boring, after listening to eager for a few minutes they can make you feel like you listened to that song before."
1,bland sorta dry sugar free tasteless,I was a huge PFR fan and had high hopes but...Oh well.. At least they put 5 seconds of silence between songs so you can tell one from another! These songs are very plain it sounds uninspired. Maybe it should have been called Eager...WHY?!Maybe Joel and Mark will take you back?
2,"A summary, not for beginners","Though I have ten years of IT experience, this book has not yet helped me with my first venture into e-mail server administration. It summarizes topics without providing implementation guidance and real-world tips. Though it was written during the beta cycle, isn't some of the authors' Exchange 2003 hands-on experience applicable to 2007? Perhaps I'm spoiled by Minasi's ""Mastering Windows Server"". Beginner e-mail administrators may want to look elsewhere."
2,Not worth it unfortunately...,"I only read the first 1/3 of this book before I got involved in an Exchange 2003 to 2007 transition. Some of what I read was applicable, however doing further research on the topic on TechNet I was able to find practically the same information for free, and often, in greater depth than this book offers.The book provides very little insight into how Exchange actually works. The parts on administering E2007 are sparse and not explained very well, and again, you can find all of this on TechNet for free.Compared to Mastering Windows Server 2003 this book is a real letdown. Granted, I've only read the first 1/3, but flipping through the rest and looking for the occasional answer to a question I've run into during the transition I've only been left wanting.I wouldn't buy it again and I certainly don't recommend it. You certainly won't master anything with this book."
4,Wonderful little book,"Found the book in very good condition considering its age. The dustjacket was a bit bent and frayed at the top but this is what happens with dj engineering in some cases. Dj was taller than the book. Great book to have, lovely old world feel, beautiful old paper, and of course George Sterling is a terrific poet! The book was dispatched admirably promptly by the seller. Thank you."
3,So pretty but impractical!,"I registered for these dishes for my wedding, and I LOVE how they look and the range of serving dishes, but we were very dismayed by how easily they chip! The china dept. rep at Macy's said the clue was the sticker that says they are not microwaveable. The glaze also tends to craze (get small cracks in it), that then allows food to seep in which stains the pottery. So here we are with 10 different platters, accessories and 8 place settings that are not going to last. Learn from my mistake!I only wish Lenox would re-design the plates so they don't have these problems, because I truly love their look."
1,Loved the design but not durable,"We chose this dinnerware for the white on white pattern, loved it. Then we used it and washed it, then hated it. The plates and bowls flake and chip, and the finish crazes. I haven't used it in the microwave, just wash in the dishwasher. Something that cannot survive dishwasher use has no place in our household."
4,Not made in Italy!!!,I ordered these dishes mainly because they claimed to be made in Italy!!!! NOT!!!!!! They are typically made in China. Since they are sooooo Large and heavy I kept them but they are Italy inspired. They are pretty just too big.
1,Horrible quality,"We got these dishes for our wedding in 2000. I made the mistake of keeping them in storage for about a year - some were at my house and some at my parents' house. After about a year, we went to use them and discovered that the glaze of many of the dishes had started to craze. The dishes with crazing were from both house, and all had been kept under normal conditions (ie, not humid or too dry). If I had discovered this earlier, I would have returned all of them. We have rarely used them since because they seem so fragile. We have never placed any in the microwave. I did put them in the dishwasher - the result was cracking. In fact, two broke in half. I hope that Lenox has improved the quality of these dishes of this line since it seems very popular. I will never buy Lennox products again. It was a huge waste of money!"
2,"Pretty, but chip easily","While I didn't purchase mine through Amazon, I have to agree with the others that they chip very easily. They are beautiful to look at, but not a dish you want to use as an everyday dinnerware."
5,Christmas Slate,The slate was exactly what I envisioned. Got a lot of compliments on it! I'll definitely be visiting this site again.
4,Provides the essential historical context for Lacan's work.,"Turkle provides a perspective on the French context in which Lacan's revision of Freudian psychoanalytic theory took place.Many clinicians and students will appreciate an understanding of the social, political and cultural millieu that allowed Lacan's ideas to flourish.Within the story of psychoanalysis in France, Turkle provides some insight into some of the more puzzling aspects of Lacanian theory, often within historical context. At points, I had the impression that Turkle was applying some of Lacan's ideas to Lacan - a task which helped impress the logic of some of Lacan's behavior, where it would otherwise have seemed inscrutible.I would recommend this book as an adjunct text for anyone intent on understanding Lacan the man, and his theories."
2,"""Hail Lacan""","If you are interested in Lacan and his work then you will love this book. I found it hard to follow. I am not well versed in Lacan and was required to read this book for a Psyc. class. It took me a long time to get through each page and when I was at the end of a chapter, I constantly found myself saying, ""Now what did I just read?"" I needed to use the notes at the end of the book and constantly re-reading chapters to understand what was going on. This book is deeply connected to French Politics and for someone who is not well versed in French Politics you can find your head spinning and getting confused as to who is who and who did what to whom."
5,DeWalt's HD CutOut Tool is G-R-R-R-EAT!!,"A crew of two just finished installing several roomsful of sheetrock for us, using the DeWalt HD CutOut Tool to cut holes for outlet boxes, switch boxes, and the like. The tool worked beautifully (of course this guy was a pro, does this every day, but the tool would be great in the hands of an amateur as well), zipping sround squares and rectangles in no time. Fun to wa tch, too -- it really Zipped around. This is a great price, as well. I'll buy one as soon as I can."
4,Satisfaction with aDW660SK cutout -tool,I purchased this tool because my roto zip cut-out tool would no longer work. I am a believer in Dewalt tools and have a considerable number of them. This tool works much better that the roto zip cut-out tool and I am very pleases with its performance.
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased the DeWalt DW660 to make some cutouts in 3/4"" plywood for recessed lights. When it arrived I was impressed with the workmanship--from the case to the accessories. I installed a 1/8"" general purpose bit, which was fairly easy, and tried a practice cut in a piece of 1/2"" birch plywood. It plunged into the wood nicely and after that it ""went downhill."" I had to push on it so hard to make the cut that I was afraid I was going to break the bit. After turning off the cutter I noticed that the bit had turned blue. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this machine. I own a lot of DeWalt tools and have been happy with all of them until this one. I rate it 2 stars because of the apparent quality of workmanship and subsequently the poor performance ot it."
2,"Nice power, but messy","I agree with the guy that's a little dissapointed in this tool. Although it has nice power, and will cut through wall board, etc. with ease (what doesn't), it is very messy. This thing will fill your house with sheetrock dust. I was cutting out a large hole in the ceiling (for wallboard repair), and the whole entire living room was completely filled with dust. I even had goggles on, and the vent on the tool directed the dust directly to my face and dust just managed to get in my eyes.The noise I can deal with (wear ear plugs), but I'm hesistant to use it for wallboard repair from now on. NOTE: This is the only power cut-out tool I ever used, so I have no reference to compare it to any other of this kind...I'm no contractor or anything, but I do a lot of home repair/carpenter/landscape & metal fabrication work as a side job."
4,Everything good except packaging,"Inside of the box it was a mess, I still didnt figure it out how or wher to put the different attachments and tool"
2,Flimsy...,"Was NOT pleased with this rotary tool. Returned for another brand.Disappointed, for the first time, in the quality of DeWalt."
2,Limited use tool that creates a big mess,"I bought this tool instead of a Rotozip after reading the reviews with high hopes. Well, I'm a bit disappointed with the lack of attachments the DeWalt tool has when compared to Rotozip or Dremel. For a cut-out tool it also generates a tremendous amount of dust, so it can't be used in a finished house without plastic partitions to seal off the area. I was expecting to use it for many other cutting jobs, but so far have only used it once in a non-occupied house and still needed to vacuum and dust everything off."
3,The Life of Jorge Negrete,"I purchase this DVD just because I like Jorge Negrete, it is a good account of his life and it has footage of him and the great Maria Felix which I had never seen before. I also learned the names of some of the movies that I would like to purchase if they ever become available. The documentary is in black & white & it is narrated by Pedro Armendaris, Jr. I recomend it to Jorge Negrete fans."
5,My go to gifts when I'm out of ideas...,"I love these boxes. I sent this one to my DH for Valentine's day, and I've done others for birthdays and the like. They are so much fun to ""sample"" the old treats from childhood. I recommend them often to those who have a sweet tooth."
1,More Info Needed,Why doesn't this description tell how long the cord is? Thats kinda important. When using the treadmill at the gym they have TVs well my regular earbuds doesn't reach and allow comfortable movement. Need more info.
4,Very Cute!!,This product is very cute. I got it for my 4 year old for christmas and he is going to love it!! He loves alabama football. The only thing I didn't like about it was the strip on the pants was a brighter red than the rest of the uniform. I know he will love it anyway.
5,All about the tickles,"This Elmo is all about the tickling...extreme tickling. You can tickle this Elmo in one of his 3 tickle spots and he's going to laugh harder and harder. You might say his laughter is EXTREME! TMX works ok on uneven surfaces. At times he falls and can't get up, but we attribute that to the extreme nature of his laughter.TMX is a catchy name, be careful not to confuse with rap star DMX, although both have a propensity for losing their mind up in here. That said, TMX reasons for losing his mind are a little more innocent than his rapping cousin, D."
4,Such a joyful toy.,"I am quite fond of the little fuzzy red fellow. Oddly enough, he seems to bring joy to adults more than children. I guess we all could use a bit of levity in our day! I give it 4 stars for kids as it doesn't seem like something you can cuddle or take to bed. But it is red and jolly and makes everyone who sees it work smile. I recommend you tickle him sparingly as it might tend to get on your nerves after a while. LOL."
2,Limited Shelf Life,"OK, yes. This toy will definately make you laugh - but it wears off rather quickly. My son LOVES Elmo. But he was not a fan of this toy. In fact, it kind of freaked him out the first few times. Once he got used to it - he wasn't interested. I was also very disappointed at how quickly it drains the batteries. Had to replace them twice in 6 weeks. (and it was not my 2 year old playing with it - it was my husband).After the initial fun wears off, this will just on a shelf or in a toy chest - unused.[...]"
1,Waste of Money,He laughed twice then died. All it did was grind gears very loudly. My daughter was disappointed but she got over it pretty quick. We replaced it with a regular stuffed animal and she is just as happy.
1,Give it a few months...,Youll find one at the local thrift store or garage sale.Remember the beanie baby collectors? Now no one can give a darn?Well that too will be this Elmo.There's an elmo giggle & shake chair that a young child would enjoy more than this doll. For only $[...].
3,My Grandaughter just loves this tickle me Elmo!,"Ken's Rave review with It Fisher-Price T.M.X. Tickle Me Elmo! Elmo has three modes of giggle action - Press its foot or belly and hear ""You tickled Elmo."" TI can go from standing to sitting. Then, it falls back, sits and stands straight up again - the whole time giggling away and flapping its right arm. Touch its belly again, and it sits and rolls from one side to the other. My grandaughter love this toy and she plays with it for hours at a time. She has eveything Elmo, but I'm sure Tickle me Elmo is her favorite."
2,Tickle Me Elmo,"I bought this for my 1 and 4-yr. old grandsons. While they did like it somewhat, it really did not keep their interest. I also thought that this doll was suppose to flip over and move its arms, which I think would have been a lot better. Perhaps that's a different model???"
4,Tickle Me Elmo,"So funny it even makes me laugh, the kids loved it. Definitely a great gift for Christmas!"
3,It makes an impression.,"I gave this toy last year to my 2-year-old granddaughter, whose household included a couple of turtles and cats. Never had she seen anything like Elmo, however, and she was simply terrified of him, even long after we had disabled and immobilized him. Moreover, the impression seems to have remained because, recently upon trying to renew her acquaintance with the curious creature, we found she was no more receptive of his attempts to entertain her. I guess the toy is potentially useful for encouraging children to love all creatures regardless of their faults and eccentricities. And the experience, in turn, may teach Elmo to be a bit less aggressive and overcompensating in his mannerisms in front of small children, some of whom, it's good to know, have not become so jaded by terrifying actions as to be insensitive to them. Fred Rogers never had to behave like Elmo to secure a child's confidence and trust."
3,buy???,"Elmo is fun for about three times through then he's a waste. Bought him for grandson who really, at age 1 1/2, couldn't have cared. He just knocked him over. The adults enjoyed watching him a few times but that got old quickly. A lot of hype for not much."
2,Scary Elmo,"I first saw Tickle me Elmo at my friend's house. I had a good laugh with it. So I decided to buy it for my 6 month old son.The first time he saw the fury Elmo rolling and talking in scary sound, he started crying.Now he is adjusting to Elmo. He does not cry anymore. However, he does not laugh at it but stares at Elmo most of the time when Elmo talks."
3,My kids aren't that interested...,"I was excited about the NEW Elmo, so I bought this for my 1 and 3 year olds who love to watch Elmo on TV. But they are not really interested in this doll. They have trouble pushing the exact spots to make him laugh. They will watch him once or twice, but then prefer other more interactive toys. Elmo stays on our shelf most of the time..."
2,"Cute until it quit working, save your receipt","We loved Elmo until it stopped working. Three days after Christmas amd yup, nothing, not some single giggle. I called fisher price. They emailed me a shipping label. However, I had to take the label and elmo to the PO. I had to pay for shipping. They are going to mail me a brand new elmo free of charge. I hope this one holds up better. So, keep your receipt."
2,Elmo = a big disapointment,"After searching long and hard for Elmo, I managed to find 2 for my daughters. While you can not help but laugh along with him, BOTH of my Elmos started to malfunction after only 3 uses. It was quite disapointing to see that after all the anticipation, he didnt last for an hour. In the end I wouldn't pay $10 for Elmo."
2,Not as good as I thought,My 15 month old got this for Christmas. I am very diappointed in the Elmo TMX. He is not cuddly at all. It's thin fabric over hard plastic. I don't know if our batteries are low or what (plan on looking more into this but haven't yet)..but he doesn't do anything on the first or second tickle but a slight jerk. It was shipped directly from amazon the day it was released in Sept. and it was like this straight from the box (sat in the closet until Christmas). It's an OK toy but not worth the price tag. My 15 month old isn't real impressed either. He can't get Elmo to do his thing because it is difficult to tickle him in exactlly the right spot. I wouldn't recommend this toy.
2,TMX Elmo,"I bought this for my 3 year old son's birthday. Although he has gotten a few laughs out of it, he never plays with it. Elmo is very hard, not soft and huggable like he used to be. The buttons that make him giggle are hard to find, except the one on his foot. He falls down a lot and actually, that is the only time he is funny. He is supposed to bend over with laughter but when he is laying down he actually stands back up. That is when my son laughs at him. This toy is hugely overpriced and overhyped. I wouldn't bother with it."
1,Waste of money,"We don't buy fad toys but this was gifted to us. I thought he was cute. But there are several things I don't like about him. He takes 6 batteries! When he ""talks"" and he's wiggling the mechanical noise of him competes with his voice. His ""tickle spots"" are buttons that really you have to push pretty good if you are a little kid. If you play him on a hard surface than his kicking feet might startle your little one as it did mine. My child was concerned for Elmo lol, she thought there was something wrong with him when he fell over. The one we were given it seemed to have short outs...it would be going and then stop and lightly pushing on him he'd rev back into action. We exchanged him with a new one from the store, same issue. Nice design flaw. Overall, my child is kinda bored with him."
1,Do not purchase this TMX elmo,"This is horrible, my 2 yr old wanted to just hug elmo and he never stayed still long enoung. He did not like elmo at all. He is now in the car ready to go back to target. Trust me do not waste your money on this elmo get your little one the 10yr anniversary elmo they will love him so much more."
3,elmo TMX,it does make you laugh but it really has been made out to be more then what is worth since some try to sell it for more then the retail sell it for and if you buy it for more then $[...] you'll be upset since it is mechanicial and not praticial for baby to hold all you really can do is look at it but if your child is not to use to noise it may scare them since it look as if the toy is after you i'm glad that i payed only what it is worth $[...] that right price for this toy since there really not much to it
4,Economic Elmo,"I personally called about 10 stores looking for this little guy. Each one said they were sold out and they couldn't tell me when they could possibly be getting some more in. The Toys R' Us was the most annying because I could clearly hear a tickle me elmo laughing in the background. Anyways, this reminds me of the Xbox 360 from just last year. My parents went searching all through November and December looking for one and didn't even see one. Same thing with the original Tickle me Elmo. As more Elmos go onto ebay the new sellers will ahve to lower there prices to be the cheapest. Everybody calm down. It's September and Christmas is nearly three months away. Fisher Price won't just stop making Elmos. There will be plenty for everybody come christmas time. Best of luck to everybody searching for one for their children!"
2,Falls apart very quickly,"I bought the TMX Elmo on a preorder from Amazon. It was intended for my 13 month old daughter. Within 3 days, Elmo stopped moving completely, though his voice still worked fine. Thinking that it may be a battery issue, my husband attempted to replace them. The foot that contained two batteries was very easy to change. The foot that contained the four-battery pack was impossible. It was wedged in there so firmly that we couldn't remove it, even trying to pry it out. I contacted Fisher-Price's customer service, and there was no surprise. I am getting a new Elmo sent out for free within three weeks. But it was clearly defective."
2,"Fun, for a little while","After 15-20 minutes of playing with it my kids lost interest. That's okay with me, since this thing was quickly becoming one of those toys you hope would fall down the stairs. I should have known better, since how much fun is a toy that you only watch?"
1,Not worth the money,"I'd give it a 0 if I could.I bought this toy last night after a customer in the store gave it great reviews. This toy is totally ridiculous. My 10 month old loves elmo. He has all of the other elmo dolls (hokey pokey, ymca, chicken dance, tickle me, rock n' roll, even the build a bear elmo) and a hand puppet and loves these. He looked at the tmx like it was having a seizure. He actually crawled away from it and didn't give it a second look. My six year old played with it for maybe a minute and then said ""Does it do anything else?"" Unfortunately, it doesn't. Maybe if it would talk or sing a song it would be better. But you can hardly understand what he is saying and it just isn't entertaining.Buy something better with your $40.00"
2,Supercute--but a hunk of junk,"My daughter received TMX Elmo from her grandparents for Christmas. It was hysterically funny for the three days it worked. Now when you ""tickle"" him, all he does is slap his hand and does a quick laugh--no more of the belly laughing or rolling on the floor. I called Fisher Price, but it was purchased through a raffle so we don't have a recipt, and although the box had never been opened, Fisher Price considered it second-hand, and could not ""service"" it. (I didn't want the stupid thing serviced--I wanted a brand new one.) I'm just going to wait until they are back in stores and will exchange it for another."
2,2yr. old mom,"Elmo is extremely adorable to all of the adults who have ""played"" with him. Unfortunately my 2yr. old is terrified of him, my husband actually wants to contact fisher-price and tell them they have scarred our child for life. On Christmas morning she just kept saying ""Elmo crying"". She likes him okay when he is turned off but we can't turn him on if she is in the room. My older kids, 9 and 6 think it is hysterical, as have all of the adults. I'm hoping in another year she will like him more. I am fortunate to have found him for $34.99, it would have been a bigger disappointment if I had paid more. She also got the Elmo giggle chair and potty time Elmo, she loves them both."
2,Frustrating,"When we opened it on Christmas it worked fine, but as the days go by it just talks a little and jerks. It doesn't do what it supposed to anymore. I replaced the batteries and there is no improvement. I'm very dissapointed."
4,elmo is great!!!,I got this for my daughter and she loves it... and so far ithas held up to her abuse. she plays with it at least one a day...love it...
2,The mystery Elmo,"Having purchased this for my grandaughter when it was still a ""secret"" I wasn't exactly sure what this product was going to do. When it finally arrived and we gave it to my grandaughter, she seemed to have rather mixed reviews (i.e., am I supposed to play with this or get scared). She seemed to like the button on the box that makes a laughing sound, and also liked to hold Elmo when it wasn't moving, but I am not so sure she enjoyed much else as regards the rest of his antics. She has other Elmo toys that sing and dance and she seems to enjoy these much more. From my perspective, after watching it go through its antics once or twice, I found it rather boring."
4,Smiles Around!!!,"I had purchased this item for my boss who loves elmo and needed a pick me up. Not only did we all laugh with elmo but ""lost"" some time at work due to our amusement. Elmo brought smiles to all of our faces and is a real joy. Not just for kids but grown ups too."
3,Beware- little ones scared of Elmo,"Most of the reviews talk about how much the adults like this toy. And the frenzy of not having them available easily, has added to the madness. But as I learned this morning when we gave him to my 21 month old son- kids may not be quite ready for this Elmo. My son cried endlessly, especially when Elmo bent over laughing and touched my son's leg. He pushed Elmo away and was scared to have him nearby. I was a bit nervous he was scarred for life and wouldn't want elmo again, but once we turned him off and put him aside, he reluctantly gave Elmo a hug. Anyway- bottom line is don't get too crazy about this toy if you can't find it. My son would have loved any Elmo just as much, and probably would prefer one that didn't ""attack"" him."
4,Neat? Yes! The best Elmo toy out there? ehh probably not,"TMX Elmo is cute, but not cuddly. Bought him for my almost 2 year old and don't know how to keep him from mauling Elmo while Elmo giggles and stands and wiggles on his belly. We had got him a Elmo-Knows-Your-Name last Christmas and for the similar MSRP as the TMX Elmo, I think Elmo-Knows-Your-Name is a better toy. TMX Elmo is not cuddly, like I remember the original tickle me Elmo being, a little dissapointed there. TMX Elmo is pretty neat, but I would certainly not spend an attrocious amount of money for this particular furry red monster when there are other more lovable Elmos out there."
1,"Too scary, too boring, too hard","Pardon me for being nostalgic, but the original Tickle Me Elmo was soft and cuddly and just had a cute laugh. This product is heavy, hard, and certainly not cuddly. I bought it for my 18 month old nephew and it scared him; his 3-year old sister didn't like it much either. So 3 minutes after he came out of the box, no one wanted anything to do with the new Elmo.Personally, I'd rather go to ebay and buy an original."
3,TMX ELMO- WORTH THE HYPE??,"I think I like Elmo better than my son- He took one look at him and was finished playing with him. I am not sure he is worth all the hype?? Elmo is cute and funny, but how many times can you watch Elmo fall to the floor laughing??"
3,Fun while it works,"I got this for our 2 1/2 year old. She was afraid of it yesterday when we gave it to her. She kept saying. ""turn it off"". Today she's gotten a little bit better. When we were showing my in-laws it got stuck and kept shaking all over the floor. We got a kick out of it, but the batteries died. So after 1 day of play we need to replace them. No problem! Yeah Right! We've spent 2 hours trying to replace the batteries on Elmo's left foot. The side that requires 4 batteries does not slide out. We've used screw drivers and everything to get them out. Needless to say right now we've given up and I will be calling customer service tomorrow. That's why I'm only giving 3 stars because I can only change the batteries in 1 foot and not both, and for such a short life span. Other than that it was fun for the adults while it lasted."
5,Adorable and funny,"Adorable and funny. I have had people of all ages enjoy the infectious laughter. The only gripes I have are - the battery seems to die too soon and the toy seems to get ""confused"" if a child picks up or pushes down the toy in the middle of a laugh.."
1,I just don't get it...,"This is the classic case of supply and demand. Do you REALLY think this toy would be so much in demand if toystore shelves were fully stocked with the things? Great lesson in mindless purchasing due to mass hysteria, but other than that- I just don't get what's so great about the toy itself. Yes- it's Elmo- but what does it DO other than laugh and move around? I've seen it and I just don't get it. IMO the popularity is just due to the fact that ""everyone wants one"" and no one can find them. It's the classic 'treasure hunt'. IMO save your money and get something a little more educational and a little less obnoxious."
3,No need to insult...,"No one should have to plan their xmas a year in advance. That's just ridiculous.As for those who say there isn't any online, go to the stores, I'm sure they have enough.I wouldn't go all crazy over a toy either. What does that teach your kids about material things when the toy will be available after the hype dies down?It's a sad sight when you see adults fight over a toy."
3,Not for younger toddlers,"My daughter is almost two and LOVES Elmo. But this toy totally freaked her out! The actions were very sudden and she wasn't expecting it. She ended up crying for several minutes and has not wanted to see the toy again. If she sees it, she runs away and says ""All done!"" It might be fun for older toddlers but just didn't go over well with ours."
4,Hilarious Elmo!,"This is probably one of the most funny and hilarious toys ever! It was a gift for a friend who collects various Sesame Street/Elmo Toys and it is the best and most funny one of the entire collection she has!Maybe not suitable for small children, but older and adults will have some great laughs! No real educational value, but the fun value is without comparison!"
3,"Funny, yes, durable, no","My sister gave my daughter the TMX Elmo as a gift for her first birthday because she adores Elmo. The entire family was there at her party for Elmo's big debut, and I must say we were all laughing so hard we had tears in our eyes. Unfortunately my daughter is now the one crying because after 6 months of very limited use Elmo has stopped working. We have tried changing our the batteries several times, but his motor seems to be dead. So, yes this toy was fun for us while it lasted, but it didn't last very long!"
4,Elmo is a great toy,I bought this toy as a gift for a friends grandchild. They were so impressed that I was asked to buy a second one. The kids loved this toy.
4,Giggles & Laughs,This was the best Elmo yet! can't wait to share with my nephew. I may just keep it myself.....
2,the battery only last couple of days,"this elmo use 6 AA batteries.After three days, elmo could not roll over nor stand up.Even changed completed new batteries, Elmo acted wired on the third tickle.The toy is fun to play.But the quality is very poor."
2,Mom to 3 year old,"In the end, I don't think my daughter will play with it that much. For the money, I expected he would do a little more than he does. He seems like one of those toys that kids like for about a day, then they don't play with much anymore. Frankly, my daughter has other ""robots"" she likes better that do more for less money."
2,Red Scary Creature,"My baby cries EVERYTIME she sees the Elmo laughing.The red hair fall off very easily, I have to vaccuum the ground whereever I put or play it. Very troublesome and not sanitary, what if the baby ate or swallowed the hair by accident?You'll see what I am saying on the carpet where this Elmo stood because it leaves the RED marks very noticeably.Conclusion is both the PARENTS and BABY are very scared of this creature."
4,Robot Elmo,"Our kids Love this toy! I, on the other hand, was a little disappointed. He's cute and funny, but not soft by any means. He is basically a robot covered in Elmo fur with no padding in between. And his left arm has Nothing in it and is sewn to his side. Why is this? He works great, just as detailed. But, for the price, he could be a little less robot like with some simple changes. My 3yr old daughter prefers her Guess What Elmo because she can carry him around like a baby, and he sings the Elmo's World theme song along with asking different questions every day. If I had to choose only one of these to buy, I would go with the Guess What Elmo for about $15 less than TMX Elmo."
3,Cute & Funny,"We bought one of these for my son when he was a few months old. He thought it was really funny when it laughed and rolled on the floor. However, now that he's a little bit older (1 year) I think he's scared of it. But us adults think that the toy is cute and funny:)"
4,TMX Good Not the Best,"My husband and I thought he was hilarious and the older kids thought it was really cute too. Unfortunately the target age loved it better turned off then on. She loves elmo and loves carrying him around, but doesn't like him so much turned on. Seems a little freaked my the movements. I will say out of the couple of elmos she has this is her favorite to cuddle with despite the awkwardness of his heavier body."
5,Go to Fisher-Price online store!!!!!,"The Fisher-Price online store is accepting orders for TMX Elmo for $40, the site said it would be available to ship on December 8, which should be plenty of time for Christmas!!!!!!!!! I just placed my order 5 minutes ago!!"
4,Great Elmo - MY favorite so far,"I sent my husband to three stores when Elmo came out, and sure enough he found him at Toys-R-Us and only paid $40. Elmo will be a Christmas present for our daughters, but we did take him out to see for ourselves what the hype is all about.I have to say that he's pretty great. He's so hilarious, I couldn't help but laugh right along with him, and wanted to keep tickling him more and more to see what other acrobatics he might do. That being said, I know my children well enough to know that he's certainly not going to be long term entertainment. Even so, I still say he's worth the money...$40, not $200...if you can get your hands on him."
3,Not the best toy for your money.,"TMX does not work very well on carpet. He will not roll around or set himself upright on anything but a hard floor. If your child picks him up while he is laughing, Elmo will stop laughing and make a grinding noise."
3,Great Toy but unreliable electronics,It stopped working after one year of purchase. First thought it was the batteries but putting new batteries did not do anything. Anyway my 2 year old still likes to hold it and play. So its not a total waste. I just feel sad after the lengths I went to get it at the time!!!
4,T.M.X. Elmos,I Work at a childcare center and we got this to cheer up sad children. It's a great toy.
5,Fun and Funny,GREAT FUN. FUN TO WATCH. GREAT A PARTIES. I am talking about adults they understand and see the similarity in people and the effort that went in to Elmo.
5,Has you laughing out loud!,We bought this for our 10 month old granddaughter (she loves Elmo). I think that the adults laughed more than she did! As she gets older we know she'll love him too. He does make her laugh!
3,OK Elmo,"After reading all the reviews and getting sucked into the marketing of this product we expected a whole lot more. My daughter turned 3 in January and was interested in him for about 4 minutes. You cannot touch him while he is in action, or he will stop during 'performance'. He actually is a little bit creepy at times..."
1,You have got to be kidding me.,"Fisher Price says this item should sell for $40.00. Wal-mart has it priced for under that. How dare you take a children's toy and hike up the price to where it is unafordable!!!!I will boycott Amazon. Too bad since that is where I did the bulk of my christmas shopping last year. Not this year-you won't get my money. My child can wait, and we will all learn not to get suckered in like this.Shame on you."
4,Great for Adults Too,"I was one of the lucky few to buy a bunch of these the day they were released, then sold them for a hefty profit on eBay. I kept one for my daughter, and it drove me insane after about a day, so I took the batteries out.It took her a few days to get over Elmo being paralyzed, but she's used to it now. He's not handicapped...he's ""handy-capable"".When we have people over for drinks, and everyone is loosened up, I pop the batteries back in and Elmo causes people to laugh so hard their margaritas come out their noses."
2,Expensive toy that last for 2 weeks,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old boy. The toy was hilarious. But, after 2 days my boy started to get bored of it. However, after 2 weeks of usage, the Elmo start to miss a few moves. After 1 month, it only laugh and waving his arm, without bending and rolling on the floor. This toy was quite expensive, so i expect a stronger durability. Should have spend the money on some other toy."
2,Entertaining for 5 minutes,"Got at Sears yesterday for $40. My 4 kids weren't very impressed. 11 yr-old daughter thinks it looks like poor Elmo's got worms (rubbing his backside on the floor) 7-yr old not too impressed, 4-yr old wants ""cuddly"" stuff more, and 1-yr old is terrified. He's cute, but the grinding mechanical parts are very loud, its not ""new"" tech at all (akin to wind-up toys of the 30's and 40's), it's hard and oddly shaped (not soft and cuddly so not great for little kids), and will be in the closet in a couple of days. Too bad.... absolutely brilliant marketing, though! He doesn't ""slap his knee"" either, just moves one arm up and down."
5,it makes me laugh out loud every time!,this doll is hilariously amazing. it throws itself ont the floor from laughing so hard and then it gets itself back up on its feet when its finished. I still laugh out loud every time. great buy!
3,Not for the children it was invented for.,"My son recieved the TMX Elmo as a Christmas Gift from his grandma. He opened it when there were several other children around. The only people who enjoyed it were the adults. My son, who is 2, and my nieces and nephews who range in age from 3-6, all went running to their parents.It was completely terrifiying to them.Anyways, 1 star for being age appropriate, but 5 stars for adult fun! so Gave it a 3 star rating overall."
3,a little difficult to understand Elmo's speech,"My two yr old daughter was very excited when she received Elmo, but she couldn't really understand what Elmo was saying? Maybe she'll grow into it later on."
1,"DEFECTIVE, DOES NOT WORK","This item was bought as a Xmas present for a child. It arrived in time, Dec 21st,however, it DOES NOT WORK,it just stands still and waves a hand. This for $159!!! There is no return label, plus you are supposedto pay for the return postage. THIS ITEM IS VERY HEAVY. Very unfair, especially the non responseseeing as this is AMAZON. It is now January 4 and I have still not heard from the seller. Do not buy."
1,Fisher-Price T.M.X. Tickle Me Elmo,Fisher-Price T.M.X. Tickle Me Elmo was one of those things done by the formerly ethical in America manufacturing company fisher price sold by bombarding the grandchildren with TV advertisements. It was and is an irritating little toy and is by now in the trash at our son's house. think hard before getting convinced to buy children's toys that are over-advertised.
5,Perfect for a 1 year old,"My brother got this TMX Elmo for my daughter last year for x-mas she had just turned 1. He went to over 8 different stores stood in lines for over hours to get it, but it was worth it. My daughter played with it from day one, she has dropped it thousands of time, and it still works, when he starts laughing and falling she immatates him and does the same, which has become a little dangerous, but she is having a good time. So it is worth the money because my baby didn't put it down for a year."
1,Amazon is a joke,"How is it possible that you order something, get a confirmation number and have your bank account charged only to have a customer serive rep tell you that your order has been canceled because they have sold out of something. I feel like the episode of Seinfeld where he makes a reservation and then they cancel it on him. What's the point of making a reservation. I wouldn't be as upset about this if I was just buying this to sell on ebay, but I was buying it for my daughter's first birthday. Needless to say that I am more than dissapointed with Amazon."
2,Elmo Having A Seizure?,"I wouldn't buy it for my children. It looks too much like my sister having a grand mal epileptic seizure. I had a regular T.M.E and my sister's kids became scaled of it,because of the shaking. They were shown this one and the oldest told me that it looks like mommy.Not cute."
3,Capitalism Rocks!!!!,"The average person does not realize how many consumers are mesmerized by eBay and have the disposable income to go with it. They may set out to buy something at a reasonable price, but the fury of the bidding war takes over and before they know it they are paying $100's for something that is not worth $100's. That my fellow consumer is the beauty of eBay and anyone who sells on eBay knows it. Capitalism Rocks!!!!"
1,Bought it for my daughter but.....,I seemed to get more of a kick out of it in the beginning. For 40.00 the novelty wears off after about 15 minutes of this annoying little troll's laugh
2,Not buying into the hype.,"My 2 year old daughter is a HUGE Elmo fan! We have bought her the original Tickle Me Elmo and several of the other Elmos also. They literally have about 20 minutes of play time on each. Now they just collect dust in the bottom of her toy box. It's a great idea but they lose their play value very quickly. Not worth [...], and especially not worth [...]. I would recommend the stuffed Elmo as she gets to take him everywhere and even gets to dress him up in her old baby clothes.Now as far as the hype goes.... I can't believe people are falling for this again. I remember 10 years ago seeing the original Tickle Me Elmo on store shelves pretty regularly the last week before Christmas, and center aisles full of them the weeks following Christmas. And this years model is not even in ""short supply"" like that one was. I have to give props to Fisher Price for their marketing genius. But folks, seriously, be smart and don't waste your money and pay over retail for this."
2,Over priced.,For the price I expected him to do more. How many times can you watch him do the same thing before it becomes boring? My daughter lost interest after only two minutes. He is not cuddly at all so all you can do is watch and watch and watch.
5,A great trilogy!!,"Can't say a whole lot the people under me haven't. After being extremely disappointed with the Crossroads & Icereach series, I too was down on DL(a first for me)but this trilogy was as engrossing as those named above were boring.I did find myself screaming at the characters to choose differently & thinking 'maybe it'll end differently, maybe the Cataclysm won't strike.' but it did. Of course, evil, as it usually does in the DL novels, stole the show. I found myself in awe & laughing at Fistandantilus's evilness & how like Raistlin he was.One small disappointment. I thought there'd be a tad more dialogue between the Kingpriest & Paladine after Beldinas realized his fatal mistake. I also would've liked to have known what Beldinas's afterlife was like. Paladine said the Kingpriest was a good man in the Chronicles. So, did he not go to the Abyss for what he did? I find it hard to believe the gods' let him off with nothing."
1,Beyond crap,The Earth Embassy in Asgard will surely be attacked if they ever learn of the existence of this movie. Poor acting. Porno movie quality value and just lame and boring. Norway should sue.
2,Metric but odd !,"The quality of the tape is good. But this tape is not numerically marked by centimeters but instead by millimeters; which is not wrong but very odd for anybody who has any familiarity with metric system. I suspect this tape was designed by a person that has never used metric system. When you pull the tape out and look at it, you will see numbers 10, 20, 30, .. 100, 200, ..700, .. 1000 and so on which they all represent millimeters. A regular (normal) metric measuring tape has the little lines for millimeter (which this tape has too) but is numerically marked by centimeters 1,2,3 and so on. This tape does not have individual marking for inches but it does have marking for 16"" and 32"" in case you need to use it for construction in US. I did not like the millimeter numbering and do not have plan to use this tape."
3,OK metric tape measure,"basic metric tape measure. I wanted one without inches, this seemed to be the only choice on amazon. The tape is OK, it extends about 6 feet horizontally before bending. It's bigger than it needs to be, has a thick rubber cover."
4,Wonderfull!,"This book demonstrates the horror of racism. And when you read it you get deeper and deeper into Amalia's thoughts. Don't pass this book up. I recommend this book for all ages, all races, and both male and female."
4,Quite Good,"This book was okay. Personally I thought that it didn't ""live up"" to the rest of the series. If you do like this series, you should read it, but don't expect to much."
2,Waste Your Time If You Want To!,"I read a different number of the California Diaries of Amalia. On the back of the book I read, it says: Sorry Nbook, I lied. But I couldn't help it. I was in no condition to write last night. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare that gets worse and worse the more I try to wake up. I am scared. Sounds like this person has a HUGE problem like she has some horrible disease or she's doing drugs but that is not the problem, she's being stalked. Okay... she's in the eighth grade and her life was just dull. Not what expected to be. I should give the author credit for putting some dramatic content in the book like violence but I need more other content. I've read better diaries. I recommend this book to six and seventh graders. I'm an eighth grader so I would give this book 2 stars. If you have a HUGE heart for people's everyday problems, this book is for you."
4,A Good Book,"Amalia, Diary 3 is a good book. I like the Amalia ones causethey're cool. there are better CA diaries than this one, but its goodtoo. i recommend it to you. Enjoy!"
5,A good Glow,"When we bought our gas fireplace we got a small bag of ""embers"" included. That was 10 yrs ago and they compress and don't work so well over time. NOW try to get another bag! You have to purchase a whole new set of logs whch is ridiculous. The Glowing Embers product is perfect and there's an adequate quantity to last for years. We're very satisfied and recommend it for replenishing older gas log kits."
2,Not as advertised,"While this stuff does glow, the photo is deceptive. There is NO LAVA in this product. It's just the normal glowing cotton ball stuff that everyone else sells for less."
4,Embers for Fireplace,This is a great product to renew your gas logs fireplace. The service was great and so is the product. thanks
1,WARNING: PICTURE IS LAVA ROCK,"Contrary to what the picture depicts, you do not get ""Replacement Lava Rock"". I made the mistake of looking at the picture and not the title and ordered the wrong product. This seems to be common with Meeco products listed on Amazon. Be warned."
4,A Young Reader's Primer to Hazardous Waste Sites,"This is a fun little book to read. The author does a great job describing the numerous technical and political aspects that contaminated sites present, and does so in a way that most young readers will appreciate and comprehend. Its filled with several ""real-world"" examples and poses questions in a manner that (I think) young readers likely would. This book would make a great reference book. Its a book that no public library or elementary/middle school library should be without!"
1,Save your money!,This thing is a toy. You would be far ahead if you spent the $bucks on a new set of drill bits. It comes with six little paper sanding rings. Maybe you could sharpen 2 bits with each one if you wanted to waste the 30 mins on each drill bit. I PLAYED with the toy for about an hour and the drill bit still wasn't sharp.
2,Fairly useful; style is grating,"While Uriagereka's introduction to Minimalism is one of the more accesible books on the subject, the reading experience is not always pleasant. Uriagereka suffers at times from the worst sort of pseudo-scientific pomposity, and the dialogues could be taken as a linguist's self-parody if they were not so obviously written in earnest. Unless you are given to writing extensively in the margins of books, you may also find it annoying that most of the pages in this >600 page book have text on only half the page. Those complaints aside, the book contains some good discussions about syntax and the Minimalist Program. Still, if you are looking for a true introduction, I would go with Webelhuth's Government and Binding and the Minimalist Program, which gives a balanced introduction to both views of syntax. The more advanced linguist will probably find the pedantic tone of Rhyme and Reason book especially grating. There are better books out on the subject."
5,The title says it all,"I found this book to be very through when it comes to giving advice on a wide range of topics regarding fiction writing. I loved hearing the different points of view from both well-known and little known authors. It kept me interested from beginning to end, and I was actually a little sad when it ended (That has never happened to me when it comes to a writing book!) I'd recommend it to any aspiring author."
2,I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this product again!,"Really High in salt (3,250 mg/box) and a third of the calories are from FAT. The package states that it contains less than 0.5% of MSG, etc....again with the neurotoxins!!! The flavor is not really cheesy as you'd expect from the hype on the box. The potatoes do remain firm though. It's hard to describe the flavor. Creamy yet artificial tasting. No, I really must NOT be sucked into buying these awful scalloped potatoes again. Buy it at your own risk."
5,Makes a truly great Microwave casserole,"One 5 ounce box of the Betty Crocker Cheesy Scalloped Skin-On Potatoes makes a truly delicious potato casserole that will serve four. For me this has become a time machine to a long forgotten comfort food.IngredientsHalf cup margarine (Smart Balance)one cup diced onionsone 8.5 oz can sweet corn or peas2.5 cups water1 cup 1% milkDirectionsin a microwavable sauce pan place Milk, Water and MargarineMicrowave on high for 5 minutesPlace corn (or peas) in strainer and rinse in running waterWhisk cheese packet into the hot water sauce mixAdd onions, corn (or peas) and potato packetMicrowave at 70% power for 5 minutes then stirRepeat the heating and stirring 2 more timeslet cool for 5 minutes"
1,"Poor quality control, poor performance","The quality control during manufacture of the sweeper body was poor. Holes in sheets of metal were not aligned properly before welding so bolts would not fit in holes. I had to drill holes to insert bolts. Holes in pins were also too small so cotter keys did not fit.The sweeper can not be used at speeds over 3mph. This is less than half the speed I normally mow with my John Deere tractor. You also can only set the sweeper a half inch from the top of the grass. So, it will not sweep twigs or leaves down in the grass. If you do not follow either of these rules, the gears on the inside of the wheels quickly become stripped. (They became stripped in the first hour I used the sweeper.)This is one of the worst tools I have ever purchased. I strongly urge readers to avoid it."
4,wonderful lawn sweeper.,"When we recieved the lawn sweeper and got it together , we realized there was a part missing. The company sent us a new part and we used it that day. It works well.It is so nice to not have clumps of grass in the yard. it is easy to dump the grass out too. I am very pleased with my purchase. Just wish it folded for easy storage."
2,Pas un bon livre,"I am not a fan of this book. After three years in French, I know what a good French book looks like, and this ain't it. The index leaves much to be desired; it is difficult to find the specific grammar points that one is looking for. ( I often find myself looking in my older French books to find things I can't locate in this text.) Furthermore, the whole book is in French, which I find unfortunate when it is explaining the more tricky, fiddly rules of grammar.The only good thing about this book is it does have examples of sentences demonstrating the various grammar points side-by-side with the rules of grammar themselves."
3,Check the system requirements,"What the seller does not make clear is that you need to be able to set your computer video card to display only 256 colors, otherwise the program will not run. I had to dig out my 9 year old Dell to run the program. That said, my daughter thought it was great to be able to play an old game from when she was just a kid."
5,A definite read aloud or independent read,We have been studying the Acient World this year. My daughters loved the tales inside this book. It is a must have.
5,"I'd go so far as to call this album ""da bomb""","If you haven't heard Zaireeka, you haven't heard the latest frontier of recorded music. An absolutely incomparable experience. A must-have for any Flaming Lips fan especially!!!"
5,a flamed llip,"respect it for nothing more than a wild experiment. who else would have dreamt of an albulm of four discs to be played at the same time. that is completly insane. but you know what, it works. it works on pure artistic merit. a symphony of sound that surrounds you, casting an ugly spell on you until you feel that you can not go on any further, then you continue, following the noise, and sound deep into a cavern of lonliness, and then you find a friend there and its the music shaking your hand and congratulating you for the journey you just made"
4,"Finally, something not annoying about music again","Just picked up this disc. AMAZING! FUN! slightly different every time. i have been lucky to have 1 large stereo, 1 Desktop comuper with big sound, 1 laptop with external speakers and a cd boom box. That makes for a great mix. This is like eating a chilled orange picked off a tree after walking through the desert.Oh and to the reviewer who suggested a mixed down version, I got this clip from the Flaming Lips website:""Whatever you do, remember this - with Zaireeka, YOU are in charge! Find your own way through new sound experiences with the experimentation kit you've got at your disposal... and if anyone offers you a single CD of Zaireeka mixed down from it's four parts, remember to laugh in their face."""
4,probably better stoned,"This is an awesome idea, play four cd's at once and have a slightly different experience each time. While I have been a fan of the Lips for awhile and got to see them at Coachella two years ago, this would have probably been more profound if under the influence of most any controlled substance. It's still nice to have and a welcome addition to the CD collection. For a decent experience, I'd suggest three cd players to really experience the whole thing."
1,"Please waste even MORE of our time, dude...","This is awful. I've followed the Lips since the very first EP, and though their style has changed, their one overwhelming character flaw continues to shine through: Wayne doesn't know when to stop. He has no respect for his listeners. He churns out tedious, mediocre product like this 9 times out of 10. I'm sick of it. Won't waste any more money on their albums."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!,I dont know why some reviewers are saying that if you get togther with friends and make a project out of it youll be dissapointed because the cds eventually go out of sync. Thyre totally missing the point. If you took the time to read the booklet youd see that they are supposed to go out of sync.Not all cd players play at the same speed. When they go out of sync it becomes like a cacaphony of sound where vocal melodies flitter from left to right and sounds echo from one cd player to another. Its an incredible experiment of sound.
5,An immense wall of unrestrained 'melodies',"The Lips' best record yet?-possibly... Their bravest yet?-definetly... and from a band like The Flaming Lips-that's saying something.There's about a million tunes here compressed into four c.d.s that shout this music at the tops of their voices and it's pretty difficult not to take note,'cause this is powerful,cocky,and fantastic stuff.Acoustic,heavy electric,new age,country,and something i simply can't describe,are all explored at the same time and the result is simply unpresidented and exhausting...worth buying for 'A Machine In India' alone..."
1,Toy not as pictured - Not worth the money,"The toy I ordered was not the toy I received. I ordered mine from ""Little Languages"" on Amazon - what I received was a small, cheap piece of junk. My son only played with it a little bit and it frustrated him because once on the elevator the cars don't really have any place to go and the ramps are very flimsy and composed of multiple, unstable pieces. Total ripoff by Little Languages - what you see on the website is not what you get in the mail."
5,matchbox hero city auto garage review,this toy is brilliant I love playing with it all you need to do is use your imageination and youll be on your way whilst you are having fun it also learns you some skills on how to put fuel into a car or take it to the garage to get fix overall this toy is fantactic i would certainly recommend it.
1,Not the toy I ordered!!!,"This was not the toy that I expected to get. The garage that I received, and paid quite a bit of money for, looks nothing like what I expected. Looking closer at this product I noticed that there are two toys mixed in on this sight. I was charged for the more expensive garage and was sent the garage that is worth less. this was quite deceiveing. I feel cheated. Of course now I will have to pack it all up and return it. Hoping to get all of my money back. Not a good thing."
3,Just Okay!!,"Was not really happy with audio quality. There were a few songs that are not easily found elsewhere. If you don't care about the audio, then buy it."
3,Essential for Clapton collectors,"This cd is the missing link between the Bluesbreakers and Cream, for all you Clapton fans. The version of ""Steppin' Out"" is historically important enough to warrant buying this. As for the other bands involved...well, I'm not really a fan/expert of any of them,but I found them to be pleasant enough listening. Sorry, but that's really all I remember about those tracks!"
5,Outstanding Example of Sony Technology,"I have the U.S. version of this camcorder and I must stay it is technology at its finest: the best combination of features, video quality, low light quality and price in the Sony line over the past five years - it's the best deal that Sony has offered in this category. The DCR-TRV38 offers excellent video performance, impressive low light performance and offers a nice manual focus ring. The superior low light performance of the DCR-TRV38 wins out over all other camcorders under $1,000"
3,A different album-by Joel,"I like different kinds of music,except heavy-death metal and Greek music.Jay Jay has not wonderful vocals,but there are good melodies and it is lounge and relaxing to listen in luyin on your bed,like Il always do.Good for trip-hop-electro fans."
3,Less than what I expected..could have been much better,"This CD, released a few months ago, was a real disappointment in that it was a re-hash, for the most part, of a bunch of choruses from the last twenty years or so. Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir and Brooklyn Tabernacle Singers usually have a grandslam homerun with their recordings, but not so this time. The remaking of a couple of the hymns, ""Draw Me nearer"" and ""Power in the blood,"" are tolerable at best. Better luck next time to an outstanding church, with an outstanding choir, and with an amazing pastoral team. I was very disappointed..Can't win them all."
3,So so,"The uncertainty which is given to Michael, disturbs the thrilling of the action. By reading the book we always expected a great end which in fact doesn't exist. It is kind of boring although you hope for a happy end, you know exactly what is going to happen. A great point was the act when Michael had to decide between Moira's life and the responsibility of the whole hotel."
3,School Review,"Lies of silence,First of all, it's clear that this book is a real theme book. I'm convinced that people who don't care about the recent or historic happenings in Ireland won't enjoy it as much as the people who do.True, the story does have a personal drama in it. The main character needs to choose between his wife and his new girlfriend.But this side of the story is in my opinion less important.It is nicely woven into the main problem however, which is: Should the main character stand up against the IRA and be a possible martyr? or should he choose for himself( and the people he loves?The book really captures the feeling of ""troubles"" in Ireland and what it must be like for society and the individual.All In all an interesting book to read if your interested in these sort of things. Certainly not superb however."
3,Just Average,I want to offer a little dissent here. I thought the book to be a bit dull and slow. I really labored to get through it and becuase of it completely turned me off to the rest of his work. I just did not buy into some of the main stroy points. It could be that I spend too much time reading action fiction so I need a fast paced book to keep me interested.
3,"Lies of silence, how realistic is it?","I read the book Lies of Silence by Brian Moore.The first thing that I noticed was that it was very realistic. All the places exist in real life and the problems are real. Of course the actions are described excitingly but that is no problem. The dilemma in the book about warning the police and testifying or not is one about which you can discus for a long long time. I felt like I was looking of the shoulder of Michael and therefore understood is problems well. Eventually he did the right and brave thing. Second dilemma is who does he choose; the girlfriend or the wife. He uses the IRA problem to get rid of his wife.By reading this book, you understand a lot more about the problems in that area."
4,Good Novel,"I think nobody really can imagine the loneliness, that Dillon had to go through. It's not only the tension that makes this book good, but also how the whole situation is explained by the author Brian Moore. Sometimes I had the feeling of being involved in the story myself. I didn't know much about the situation in Ireland, but , reading the book, I got to know (and to feel) the situation in this country. But since I'm not surrounded by those problems, there are still some things I can't really follow. But the novel, as a reader, is very good. It's thrilling, and the most important thing is, it makes you think. Matías"
3,not very captivating,"The novel wasn't very captivating. The story was very predictable, especially when you read (like me) first the last sentence of the book. I have to mention that I didn't like the end because it was too clear for me. I like endings where you have to imagine yourself what's going to happen now, but in ""lies of silence"" there is nothing what is worth to imagine. The minds of the characters aren't well shown. You get to know them only superficially and that's a great pitty. The book deals with the problems of the Irish people and when you don't know well about the situation and the traditions there like me, you don't understand the gravity of the problem. Patrik Schmid"
3,fairly good,"We could not identify us with the main actor Dillon on the contrary we got very excited about his actions. Especially at the end he doesn't think and doesn't want to see the danger, he seems to be naive and we can't imagine that anyone can react this way. The topic of the book is chosen well, but when the main actor has an incomprehensible way to react, the book isn't our style. On the other side we learnt much about the Irish political problems like the quarrel between Catholics and Protestants and about the methods of the IRA."
1,Book review: Brian Moore - Lies of silence,"Lies of silence is the most boring book i've ever read. What Brian Moore discribes on ca.130 pages could have benn written on max. 2 pages. In this book nothing really intersting happens. Anti-IRA-tirades, changing attitudes and two main characters who don't know what they really want. And this on 130pages repeating itself..."
5,The BEST cooking book EVER!,"I have had this book for 20 years. It is the most common wedding present I give, not to mention the most thankful one. Everything anyone, from beginner to everyday cook, needs to know about preparing food is in this book.Not just delicious recipes, but common sense needs, like how to prepare an artichoke to the perfect hard boiled eggs. Timetables for boiling meat and cooking beans. This book includes grilling methods, making pasta, freezing times, and microwaving fresh veggies.Constant tips are placed throughout the book, how to buy a turkey, cooking with oils, selecting cookware, even coffee roasts.The pictures are stunning, the recipes are succulent.It's always important to have a book in front of you that you can count on for anwers when cooking is important to you.I recommend this book now, and have for the past 20 years!"
4,Very Cute!,"I had never seen a charm for a cellphone. But my daughter is really into these skeletal animals so when I saw the charm, I just had to get it for her birthday. She loves it."
1,Clarke good; recording lousy.,"Whereas Clarke is obviously master of the cornet, this CD is so full of hiss as to be unpleasant listening."
3,Worth watching,"A story about a deep, enduring love and passion between two females that exists through years of loneliness, tragedy, yearning, sacrifice and separation. There are several messages flowing through the central theme: recognizing something that has been buried and forgotten with just a touch, surviving life's disappointments by receding into a world of fantasy, surrendering dreams and desires in favor of family cohesion, and hiding one's true self behind a masquerade. Although it is subtitled, the dynamics are a universal language. While there is no role-playing in the relationship between the women, the top/bottom undercurrent is unmistakable -- and sexual depravity is the indulgence of men. The major drawback for me was the use of the ""jasmine"" song meant to convey longing: it serves its purpose the first time and makes sense when restated near the end, but the repetition of it otherwise was downright annoying."
5,A Perfect Film,"I LOVED THIS FILM! Zero Chou has to be one of the most exciting new film makers out there. This film has it all: interesting story line, good writing, great cinematography and direction, and superb acting. A PERFECT film! Can't wait for Chou's next film ""Drifting Flowers""!"
5,Love the movie,Love the movie! The disc was a good quality sort of disc. Overall I was very pleased with the purchase.
2,An okay movie,"I went to see the movie when it first coming out, I was so excited about this movie because it looks good (and usually, what looks good is good). But it turns out not like what I hope, so don't get your hope up too high.This movie is very boring, the main producer (which is a lesbian herself, I think) added too much storyline for the movie (from earthquake, an abnormal brother to a web-cam girl involves with polices), which helps to bring down the movie. Sometimes, I just wish the producers had written more about the relationship between the two characters rather than focus on everything else. Also, some of the characters in the movie are very annoying.Overall, it's not really a good movie, but may be quite enjoyable by some people."
5,Grows on you: I listen to it every day for inspiration,"I'm not a ravenous fan or a collector--I just have a few of Pat's albums and love the subtle interplay of instruments on many of his tunes. This album has many songs with twists and perturbations of this nature, so much so that you can't hear them all in even a dozen plays. At a certain time of day, maybe when I've had a minor breakthrough in work and feel a bit better about everything, the album feels like an intellectual reward. Listen to the first few songs a hundred times and you'll know what I mean."
5,A really cool record,I love this CD!I think that the best song on it is 'Follow Me'If you were to buy one Pat Metheny CD it would be 'Imaginary Day'
3,Looks like a concept album,"The first thing I did when I bought this CD in January 1999 was to decipher the text inside; then I noticed the coincidences between the story that is told and the music (except to ""Roots of Coincidence""). I liked the music very much, but now I call it rather boring. It lacks of improvisation, although the tunes are nice."
1,Are you kidding!,"I can't beleive the amount of good reviews of this CD. I have most of the Pat Metheny library and this CD is the worst by far. It was like listening to all of his un-inspired, not-as-good, filler songs in one sitting. Yuck! Don't get me wrong, I love Pat Metheny's work, but this CD was just BAD!"
5,This one is for the real metheny fan.,"Went to the live show at the State theatre in New Jersey, and it was one of the best ever. Even better then the pier concert several years earlier in New York. Can't wait for Pat and Lyle to do it again. Beat 70 is my favorite.. along with everything he has done."
3,Each member must leave and go on by themselves.,"i was hoping to see the past performance of the group but i was dissapointed. They radically changed their style in the wrong way. They can never achieve the popularitty gained by the albums ""still life taking"" and ""letter from home"" unless they remember the past."
5,Modern approach to IT proj. mgmt. with a practical view,"IT projects are increasingly complex. A number of different models have been developed over the years including the CMM model. However, these do not fit many real world situations. What has been lacking are sources that address the real world issues that IT and business managers face. This book stands out from other project management books because it deals with maintenance, enhancement, development, and management of resources using modern tools. This is an important book because it contains so much useful information. The book also provides guidelines for measuring projects, presenting projects, and working with business managers on IT issues. We use it across our over 50 projects."
4,"Great deal, despite some bad reviews...","I like knives, and as far as ""China-made"" knives go, I think these were a good deal. My complaint about most knives at this price range is that only one side angles to an edge. Most professional kitchen knives have both sides angled to a fine edge. These knives are like that, and I enjoy sharpening them. My set wasn't set crooked like one of the reviewers said, and I easily got them to a razor edge, sharp enough to shave with, using the sharpening stick that comes with the set. What remains to be seen is how long the edge will last...but then, I don't expect too much from knives at this price range. However, I'm not about to go out and spend [a lot of money] on a kitchen knife set, so my expectations are set at the right level. That's all there is to it...set your expectations right and you'll be happy with this set."
3,Great for the money,"We knew we needed better knives this year with 10 relatives visiting for Thanksgiving (hmm, perhaps that came out wrong), but I'm still happy with the knives. They have a good balanced weight and a very comfortable grip (soft but stiff handles).We were surprised to see ""made in China"" stamped on each of what we thought were french knives :)Be warned ... the block is a 14 piece block so you'll have 1 slot empty. We thought we were missing a knife until we realized the block counts as one of the pieces.I gave the product 3 stars based on the knife quality, not price, since I have no way of knowing the price Amazon will have on it when you read this."
3,disapointed,"I don' t have a problem with the knife set for general use in the kitchen, but I was made to believe that they were true ""Sabatier"" from France. This set was made in China. That and the price is the only reason I bought them. I guess that I should do more research in the future."
3,Disappointed,"I share the same complaints/surprises that others have identified about the fact that these are ""made in China"" and definitely of a lower quality than the regular line.In other words, these are poor quality relative to what I expected from this brand. They didn't appear to be very sharp out of the box - even after attempting to sharpen them they don't seem to cut much better than similarly priced knives from KMart. They feel OK but not like the expensive stuff I tried out before discovering this deal.I'll be handing these off to Goodwill and heading to a high-end store to get what I pay for (which will be significantly more than what these cost)."
5,What a deal!,"I am a chef, so I know knives. This is a great deal on a very good set of knives, what a savings. Don't waste your money on any other brand, Sabatier has always been a fine quality knife and this deal is unbeatable!!"
2,LUCKY TO GET A TWO,"....so disappointed. The knives are rusting. The name I trusted so explicitly has let me down. The knives aren't very sharp, the weight is fine.. and maybe they would be a great ""deal"" for newlyweds or someone beginning their kitchen; however, if you're a serious cook, who appreciates quality, whether it's a $ zester or $??? food processor, you're in for a surprise, and not a good one. I'm surprised Sabatier would lend their name to this item. It seems more and more companies are doing following this trend, making it difficult to tell whether you're getting a bargain, or an inferior product.... until you've used it."
1,Not Sabatier,I agree with steve hobson 100%. CAVEAT EMPTOR!I returned them. I would be too embarassed to give these as a gift. I wrote Sabatier to tell them of this sham.You want to know the funniest part of this set? The sharpening steel! I don't thing the Chinese were quite clear on the concept.
3,Worth the price - but beware an open knife slot!,"I just purchased this set based on the Amazon.com reviews and I am quite satisfied based on the price/knife qualty. I paid just as much for a smaller block set of poor quality ""stamped"" knives from Target and these are far superior. However - as stated in other reviews - the wood block that comes with the knives is a bit sub-par in that one of the steak knives is not properly aligned. It is not so bad that I am ashamed to display the knife set on my counter, but it is noticable. Also beware you only get 12 knives (plus the block and scissors) but there are 14 slots. Room to grow I suppose. If you require the best, you should pay 4X more for the good German knife set, for the rest of us, these are a great deal."
3,Perfect Grip 14 Piece,"very nice knives, nice feel in your hand, cut very well, complaint is that they get rust spots on them after washing."
1,rust?!,"i bought this set of knives under the assumption that i'm not getting top quality, however what i most certainly did *not* expect was the rust that showed up on several knives after the first washing! rust!! stainless steel do not rust. i don't know what these are made of, but it's not ""High-carbon stainless-steel blades"" as touted by the description.i won't comment on the other aspects of the quality, but a rusted knife is a health hazard. save yourself some money on healthcare and spend a little more for a descent set of knives."
4,Very nice handles!,"It really is a Perfect grip! I have yet to experience the things other reviewers said about the rusting and etc. But we'll just have to wait and see. So far it cuts nice and is excelent for the price.Ok, it rusts but for the price we'll just toss them and buy a new set as needed."
3,only 13 pieces?,"As someone indicated before, when I got my set, it only has 13 piece. The knifes look good. but less one piece bugs me a little bit. ..."
4,Excellent knives for the $40 price,"Just received a set of these ""Made in China"" Sabatier knives. First, do not confuse these knives with those made in France and don't compare them with fine German knives. BUT, you are not paying $900 for the set either. Are the European made knives 30 times better than these - NO. The knives I received did show some sloppy finishing and tool marks on the blades and they clearly say ""Made in China"" on the back of the blade. But the blades are forged, they are very sharp and should work fine as everyday kitchen knives. I consider this a very good buy."
2,Making good knifes is difficult,"Making good knifes is difficult. Making good wooden blocks to store knives, isn't, that is why there are much cheaper. I bought the 14 piece set for $25 during a promotion, and that is what the block is worth. The knifes are not entirely worthless, however, if you cook a lot (and I mean really a lot), think twice about this set of knifes. The steak knifes are o.k., at least to cut grapefruits. The scissors are great. The paring knives don't hold their sharpness long enough. The bread knife is o.k. The vegetable knife is a big disappointment. It cuts sideways, and is almost always blunt.I guess the wisdom holds true: If something is too good to be true (i.e., getting 14 knives for $25 (or even $80)), then it probably isn't."
2,"My Rusty, Dull Knife Set","I got this brand because my parents had a good set of Sabatier knives that lasted 40 years... These are not the same knife.Too late, I looked up Sabatier on wikipedia -- it is a diluted brand because it was made before the French copyright laws were written. As a result there are many, many Sabatier knife makers, some in China, some in France. The oldest Sabatiers include ""Sabatier Lion"" (made in France) which turned me on to the name, ""Sabatier Diamond"", ""Sabatier-K"".Now on to this knife set -- I have a sharpenning stone, and use it often. As stated elsewhere, these don't hold an edge. I sharpenned a J.A.Henkels once, after I got it in Dec 2006, and I haven't had to sharpen it again (it is March 2007), even after heavy use. These chinese knives lose their edge between vegetables.Also, they have developed rust spots. ""Stainless Steel"" indeed!Spend a few bucks extra and get a real knife set. Don't trust ""Sabatier"" unless it's made in France.-J"
3,You will get what you are paying for,"Like many other Amazon users, I purchased this knife set in December of 2002 when it was advertised as a great deal. The discount was something like 93%. What a deal, right?Here we are 3 years later.Rust? Yes.Handles sliding off? Yes.Shears in pieces and dull edges all around? Yes, and, no matter how many trips through the sharpener...Yes.Like the other reviewers, I knew what I was getting when I got it, but I should've known better.China still has a way to go with cutlery - instead, let me suggest the Henckels Four Star 7-Piece Block Set - a good starter set for a bit more bank."
2,Report after 18 months - rust and breakage,"I have had this set for 18 months, and some serious problems are beginning to show. I would be angry if I had paid as much as is now being asked for these. The strong point is that the knives take and keep an edge to a satisfactory degree, but they have already developed permanent rust spots. This is in spite of their always being cleaned immediately and then dried before being returned to the knife block. This week, the ""shears"" broke asunder while cutting the breastbone of a roasted chicken. When they arrived and I discovered that they were made in China, I considered sending them back. Now, however, I remember a French Sabatier handle disintegrating in my hand while I was chopping vegetables 20 years ago, so it may not matter where they are made. Two points make a straight line, and you get what you pay for. Since I paid very little, I give these a second star."
2,Making good knifes is difficult,"Making good knifes is difficult. Making good wooden blocks to store knives, isn't, that is why there are much cheaper... The knifes are not entirely worthless, however, if you cook a lot (and I mean really a lot), think twice about this set of knifes. The steak knifes are o.k., at least to cut grapefruits. The scissors are great. The paring knives don't hold their sharpness long enough. The bread knife is o.k. The vegetable knife is a big disappointment. It cuts sideways, and is almost always blunt.I guess the wisdom holds true: If something is too good to be true (i.e., getting 14 knives for [that cheap]), then it probably isn't."
4,Great Quality for $$,"Both spouses do a lot of cooking and are very pleased with the quality of these knives. The edges are so sharp that we were hesitant to let our teenage children use them- who also do a lot of cooking. Have experienced no rusting or ""black"" marks. The paring knife has not kept it's sharpness as well as I would have expected. Other than that, it's a great set of knives for the money!"
3,a less than perfect set,"While the knives in this set are good, the package arrived without the critical paring knife that was supposed to be included. The set contained 13 knives and a block. This error probably occurred in factory packaging -- and could have been caught easily. Does anyone check merchandise before it is sent to assure contents are complete?"
1,"Horrible ""kwalitee"" control","You get what you pay for. Yeah, right. Some of the knives in the set are relatively good for a $... set. Others show obvious signs of poor forging. Pieces of metal are missing from the blades, even the laser engraved lettering ""Made in China"" is half-wiped off on one of the knives. The worst new year gift I ever made. I am definitely going to send it back."
1,bad knives,I'll make this brief. The handles fall off and Amazon does not gaurantee them. Buy them at your own folly.
5,"Nice set of knives, especially for the price","I think this is a really nice set of knives, given that I paid [item price]for them. One of my steak knives has a little blob of epoxy or something on it, but other than that, the set looks good. The edges are sharp, and the knives have good balance to them. ..., so I am enjoying using these. Don't try to compare this set to the [$$$] French made Sabatier knives. You get what you pay for, and for less than [$$$], I think I got a heck of a bargain."
1,Does not charge 6030,I purchased this and it does not charge the Nokia 6030. The plug does fit though but no charging happens.
3,Not my trip,"It's called Lesbian. A sticker on the wrapper states ""New Wave of American Psychadelic Metal, there's only four songs and the cover art is pretty sick. Should be awesome right? Why do bands bother to record vocals if they are just going to scream. There were some really cool moments and the instrumentation in places was quite lush and well crafted, but I was looking for more than droning passages of downtuned sludge and incoherent rasp.Admitidly the cd may grow on you but my mind was made up the moment I heard the vocals. I put this in the pile of Mastodon, Giant Squid, newer Isis, and Kayo Dot. Likewise, interesting music, but Im waiting for the screaming nonsense over beautiful music trend to end."
5,Indispensable.,"Arnheim always sheds some new light on his subjects, and this book might be his most enlightening. Whether you care about art, education, perception, or simply living a full human life, this book will make you think about the subject in a new way. Grounded in careful analysis of specific objects and experiences, Arnheim nonetheless manages to convey the importance of his ideas to the wider subject of human consciousness."
1,Are you KIDDING me?,"Who in the world would pay over $4,000.00 for a map or atlas of Chattanooga, TN? These people are either doped up or pure criminals."
1,no compressor,"I can't give a good review as i don't have the item , two compressors shipped but i never took ownership. It came severly damaged twice so i cancelled the order. Someday, the shipping department will get it's act together on how to pack a large item securely."
4,Nice chips. but walmart is way cheaper,"Found the same exact chips at the virtually same price on walmart. Plus, you won't be paying for that big shipping fee so go to walmart.The chips themselves were good. Cards are papers and won't even shuffle."
4,Pure Protoculture Surge of Action,"This book, I felt, was refreshing! I had to put up with SIX space based books of the First Robotech War, this was mostly ground based with a diffrent spin on the characters; all teenagers(except Angelo Dante, but he was only 23 years old). I liked how imanginitive and creative these young heros were. They lived with 20 years of peace after the SDF-3 left and then had to go to their father's and mother's old business of war. I loved what they did in the end; they just left. They didn't mutiny, abandon their post, quit, or retire; they just quit. Who can blame them."
4,Did not invert in high winds,"The first time I tried the umbrella out we were having high wind warnings, and I was very pleased because the umbrella did NOT invert! My only complaint is that it is hard to open and close. I wold have preferred an automatic opener."
4,Gust Busters Umbrella,I was specifically looking for a large golf umbrella to replace my other large size umbrella. This umbrella is exactly what I was looking for. It is large enough for 2 people and has held up well under the extreme winds we sometimes have in Ohio. Everything seems well made and quality is good. My only complaint is the lever that locks the umbrella in place when you open it. It is soft rubber versus the usual hard plastic and took a bit of getting used to. Once I got used to that it hasn't been a problem. I will probably buy other one just like this and keep it at work as a spare.
3,STRONG rubber smell that sort of fades,"As an umbrella, this thing is AWESOME. It is wide, it hold up to the wing and it is easy to operate. But like many other reviewers have said, the handle has a VERY strong rubber smell. That smell quickly permeates a room during the first week of ownership. Eventually the smell gets weak and you no longer have it stink up a room, but it can leave a smell on your hand. Also, be careful not to let the handle rub against your wall. I leaned this on a well and it fell, leaving a black mark on the wall. Nothing a magic eraser couldn't fix but annoying. Its a good umbrella but next time I will get a wooden handle version."
5,Great Umbrella,Just a note to say this umbrella is very well made strudy and good looking.Did not try it yet in heavy winds but the design looks like it can handle it.
1,Where's my stuff??,"I ordered this product 3 weeks ago and still haven't received it, it actually hasn't shipped as of yet???? By the time I get it, I'm afraid the rain season will be over and snow will arrive."
5,Good Product,"I was worried the item might be thin and cheesy. It is very good quality though, I am very pleased with the product and plan to purchase more."
4,Wearing wrist band while using computer mouse,I've been wearing the wrist band while using my computer mouse to cushion a bone at the base of my palm. Works pretty good for that!
4,Absorbent,"I bought a bunch of these (I play tennis a lot in hot weather). They are indeed very absorbent, I played over two sets and my hands were still dry. The funny thing is that they feel like they are not absorbent, it feels like they have a coating of something that you would think would not absorb water (you know like those cheap towels that will not dry you up?) Yet I don't know how it does it, but on my wrist and on my head from the inside, it absorbs all the sweat (maybe the outside is coated differently?). I have not washed them, which will be the real test, but you certainly can't beat the price.I had them for over a 2 years now, they look really old after the FIRST wash, but boy, they work just as well, still very tight elastic and still very absorbent (the coating goes with the first wash). I was going to buy more, but I bought 12 pairs but they have worked so well and still going, I have not even open 6 of them!"
5,Great additions if you really sweat!,"This sweatband set is great if you want comfort and need absorption. I've compared it to those I see in sporting goods stores and recommend it to the thin, gauzy things they have. Unless you spend much more to get a name brand insignia, this material is thicker, stronger, and has far superior quality than anything else I've tried. The headband catches the sweat running from my head, so not a drop gets to my eyes. The wristbands are great to wipe the sweat on my face and neck without having to break stride. I will be getting more in different colors."
5,a wonderful book,I got this book for a friend of mine who is also becoming a grandmother. My grandchildren LOVE it.
2,This is miniature and flimsy!,"This was not what I expected--so be sure you check out the size (5 1/2 inches tall). I've checked out a version of ""Pat the Bunny"" from the library that was bigger...and I think it included more pages. This must be a scaled-down a cheapened copy. It's just cardstock on a plastic spine. Definitely not one you can let a toddler read on their own. I think my baby will like it...I'll just have to be with her when we read it and be careful!"
2,Of limited interest to my son - format dated,"My son loves feel & touch books, lift-the flap books and anything with exciting colours & images. Having read the previous reviews for this book, I was eagerly awaiting it's arrival. Sadly I was disappointed, and my son has shown little interest , prefering many of his other books to this one. The principal is great, but the book is rather dated - a new version, with more interesting illustrations but keeping the old ideas, would go a long way."
2,Son shows no interest,"Got this book for my son when he was about 11 months old. He was mildly interested the first couple of times but, has shown little to no interest since. I should have had him check out a copy in a book store first. The artwork seems a bit dated and the colors lacks any vibrancy (is that a word?)."
2,A little overrated,"Compared to Eric Carle, Rebecca Emberley and Dr. Seuss, I think this book is a little overrated. The illustrations are dated and don't hold my son's attention at all. I bought this because it had a good reputation, but I'm disappointed."
2,Pat the Bunny book (not as published in 1970's),"Our children (now mid 30's) had enjoyed the original Pat the Bunny book. I saw this version on Amazon and ordered it for our granddaughter. The quality was not the same as I had remembered. The original had sturdy cardboard pages that were substantial and held up for many years, I am sure. This newly printed version is smaller and the pages are two thin pages held together at the back with a plastic spiral. I ordered this product for a birthday gift and did not see the product until it was received just prior to the birthday. I was disappointed in the quality and advised the shipper.We were given a refund on the purchase price."
3,Cute Touch and Feel Book,"It's a really cute book. I did not like that it's not a ""hard"" page book like the rest of the books I have purchased for my daughter."
1,"Not only is it boring, it's also overpriced and cheaply made","I am at a complete loss as to why this book is a classic. Is it just because it has been around so long? The story is non-existent and the language is halting and awkward (and yes, I get that repetition is good for language development, but not if you can't stand to read it more than once). ""Bunny is eating his good supper."" Really? In addition to it's lack of charm, the book itself is cheaply made, smells funny and can be unsafe, as the plastic binder is easily removed by determined little hands. There are far better books for $10."
2,Damaged,"The box was totally trashed & badly taped together. Inside the book itself was damaged, I was very disappointed with this gift set."
3,arrived damaged,"I ordered 3 Pat the Bunny............arrived in a timely manner, however, one of the books was crushed. Disappointing, as I cannot give that as a gift. I am certain that was the fault of the USPS."
2,BOOK IS NOT STURDY,But ok if its for sentimental value. My son ripped it to shreds the first day. You're better off with Hello Bee Hello Me if you are looking for something baby can hold himself.
1,Not the most entertaining or high quality - was a bit disappointed,"My daughter was excited to get this book as she had the ""Pat the Bunny"" stuffed animal. This was the most substandard book I think I have ever purchased. It was only slightly more than loose-leaf paper bound by plastic rings. It was already falling apart after one read-through. I know this is supposed to be a classic, but the content itself was horrendous - almost nothing about ""Pat the Bunny"" and my daughter was very upset with how boring and little bunny content there was in this book. Get the stuffed animal - DONT bother with the book!"
2,"Great book, poor condition!","This is a great book for my soon-to-be newborn.HOWEVERThe actual product was ripped. There is a descriptive box that holds the book and it was already torn up. Also, the book inside seemed to be all wrinkled as well!Very surprised by Amazon. It almost seemed like the book was used or something."
3,poor binding,"Pat the Bunny is a classic book for babies. We bought the deluxe edition. However, the binding is such that the whole interior of the book came apart from the book's cover."
3,Cheap paper,"Paper seems very cheap. Won't last long for curious little hands. Contents look good but will be better if it's a board book. Since it's only 10 bucks, I won't bother return it."
2,Not Impressed,"The touch and feel aspect about this book is nice, however there is nothing very impressive about this book. Of all the children I've worked with, no child has been particularly fond of ""Pat the Bunny"". I feel like it has a very limited targeted age group - children who are old enough to follow the book's instructions and be captured by the story; but young enough to not mind it's otherwise simplistic nature. Maybe 15-30 months-old children?"
4,surprised at how small the book and bear was!,"The book is not very sturdy, it can very easily tear. I wish the binding was different as well. I was expecting a little more considering it was 12.00...with all that being sad my daughter who's three seem to like it.."
2,Item was damaged,I ordered Pat the Bunny Book and stuffed animal in a packaged set as a Christmas gift for my sister's baby. The book was smashed and the pages were separated from the binder. I had to go out and buy a new book to give. Very disappointed. Thumbs DOWN.
5,Pat the Bunny (Touch and Feel Book),"I'd recomend this book to anyone with a new baby. My son, (now 28) and my grand-daughter (5 months) both enjoy(ed) the story and the tactile stimulation"
1,"Great book, terrible binding","My one year old loves this book, but the plastic spiral binding is really awful. It came unbound the first time I opened it, before the baby even touched it."
3,Binding designed by someone who clearly does not have children.,"The book itself is very sweet and entertaining. My daughter is quite taken with it. What she is completely obsessed with, however, is yanking the flimsy, plastic comb binding apart. I don't know what think-tank thought of that one, but it is a major FAIL. Also, just a side note, the ""flowers"" smell like a urinal cake, so says my husband and in-laws. Lol! My daughter certainly doesn't mind, but she also pretty much just breezes past that page. So...Story: 4 out of 5 starsConstruction: 2 out of 5 stars"
2,Flimsy construction undermines a great book,"The contents of the book are fascinating for kids and if you can get a solidly built book, then by all means do it. I was very disappointed to find out it's a flimsy, cheaply constructed book out of thin cardboard. This won't last a week with a small child."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,WHAT A GREAT BOOK. Toddler gets to touch and feel stuff just like Paul and Judy. I think this book also makes a perfect gift for new moms.
3,This book can be very effective but is flawed.,"This book is a powerful introduction to enjoying books if presented by a loving reader who emphasizes its strong points and demonstrates care in handling a book. It is seriously flawed for any other than an Aryan child by the bright yellow hair and pink skin, though a good reader will avoid the child's noticing. I say this as one who presented it to a brown-skinned child as part of a prescribed program. The child absolutely loved all of it and wanted her mother to read it over and over- the ring, Daddy's scratchy face, the soft bunny, the mirror to see in. The choice and flow of events is charming, which is why the book has endured. Wish there were a less Caucasian version."
1,It's scented :o((((,I'm allergic to perfume. I wish I had seen some indication that this book was artificially scented before I bought it. I got sick just unpacking the box.
1,Not all that sweet,Overall just kind of cheap feeling. I'm pretty sure my daughter will destoy this soon. The bunny fur already came off in big clumps with the first pat. I would return it but who has the time as a busy mom??
3,Falls Apart,"The book is nice, it's much larger than I had imagined. The book I had as a child was smaller in dimension. Unfortunately, the book is bound with a plastic ring that separates from the book very easily. You have to turn the pages very carefully to avoid pulling the book apart, not good for a child."
5,thrilled,this is my son's favorite book! We love the two restored pages. This book helps develop fine and gross motor skills and will be a big hit in our house for years to come.
2,The binding is really cheap.,"The very first time I opened it and looked through the pages, it fell apart. The book is bound really cheaply. I had to re-assemble it which was very annoying and now I don't even want to open it so it doesn't fall apart again. I can see that I will end up throwing it out since when it falls apart, the spine can hurt my little one's fingers. Very disappointed."
1,Book is very CHEAP,Book is very poorly made. Story the same as years ago however very disappointed with the quality of the book
3,"Toddler loves it, but...","The construction is really flimsy. This book is now in 3 pieces. My son still loves to read it, so I will be buying another copy. I wish there were a true board book version of this book."
2,"Good Book, Poor Quality for the price.","This book is just begging to be ripped apart, I did not realize how flimsy it was from the picture."
2,good book but not durable,This book is very cute and my son loves it. It just falls apart so easily though and can be very frustrating.
2,Pat the Bunny,"The story itself is a classic, but I was disappointed in the quality of the book considering the cost"
2,"a timeless classic, but too fragile for little ones.","This ""Pat the Bunny"" book is exactly like the one I got for my boys 20 years ago when they were small. It's cute and inventive, but it is NOT sturdy enough for toddlers. Ours fell apart right away. Also the story and activities were not especially engaging for my boys. If you do buy it, I suggest that you put it out of the child's reach after you read it. Or buy high-quality board books instead.As an aside, couple of terrific bunny-books that I recommend for youngsters are: ""The Country Bunny and the Golden Shoes"", (I can't say enough praises about this it, though it was published in 1939!), and ""Home for a Bunny"", a beautiful Golden Book. The story is sweet, and the illustrations so beautiful that I still love to look at them. Amazon has the ""big version"" which is hard backed. The ""Country Bunny"" is sold in the soft-cover version here."
3,"great book, but will fall apart!!","I loved this book as a child and looked forward to sharing it with my son who also enjoyed it. Unfortunately pages quickly fell apart from the comb binding. I put it back together a few times, but now the holes are ripped, we have lost a page and it cannot be re-assembled. I would consider this to be in the same category as a pop up book in that it can only be used by a toddler with 100% supervision or the book will be destroyed."
5,A true classic!,I recently purchased this for my 19 month old daughter. She was immediately drawn to it. My daughter enjoyed exploring the different textures within the book and readily followed along with all prompts. An excellent book for a toddler!
3,A classic form childhood,Fun for a baby to touch and smell the different pages. Board book form allows it to be read easily using one hand. Exactly the same book I enjoyed as a kid. Rips apart more easily than I would like.
2,good content but poorly made book,"my daughter loves this book, but has obliterated it since it is so poorly made (light cardboard w/a plastic ring binder). the ""touch and feel"" series is a better bet."
2,Great but... Shoddy quality!,"I love this book and my son loves it too but really- I think they keep selling so many copies because people have to buy multiples when they fall apart!!!!It would be great if they could make this in a board book without the spiral plastic ring and/or laminated pages to prevent tearing off the spiral ring. The pages easily rip off.At $10 bucks each- I feel ""ripped"" off."
2,Not so fun for the little one,"I thought this would be a great first book for my son since it is a ""classic"" and all, but the hardbook edition isn't all that fun for baby. Each page has something that the baby can see and touch i.e. he/she can actually ""pat the bunny"" and feel a sonft, furry bunny. Some pages are just too harsh, for example one page says baby can feel daddy's stubble or something like that, and there's a picture of a man shaving with a piece of sandpaper on his cheek! Needless to say, that page is too harsh for baby's soft skin and he didn't really like that. Other pages tell baby to put his/her finger inside a hole and do some other activities which are just bland. And the colors throughout the book are rather pale. Baby likes a lot of his other books with more mirrors and colors, and books that are soft so he can eat them!"
3,Deluxe is not always better,"I bought Pat the Bunny for the a child in Germany. She is the granddaughter of a good friend of mine who also a German. Each year I buy the little girl an age-appropriate classic American child's book as a birthday gift. I was excited to send Pat the Bunny as this year's addition to her little English library.I had only one choice when I purchased the book - the deluxe edition. Of course, its deluxe status meant a higher price. The fact that it was in a larger format, that it had pages restored from the original book from the 1940's, and that it was in a box with a dust cover did not impress me - and would mean nothing to the child. The quality of the deluxe edition was fine, but it was just too much. I wanted the simple, little Pat the Bunny book that I have read to nieces and nephews so many times.I do wish that Amazon would give a choice: if there is a deluxe edition of any book, also make sure there is just the normal, simple, basic version available."
2,"Pat Bunny gift box was dirty, seal broken","I was alarmed when I received the Pat the Bunny gift set of book and bunny. The plastic sleeve over the box had broken Scotch tape and the sleeve itself was quite dirty. A gummy residue where a tag had been removed looked as if it had been stored on a filthy floor--dirt adhered. I used alcohol to finally scrub it off. It seemed there was a small pick in the bunny--a loose thread (?)In all, I was quite disappointed at the hygiene of the package--after all, it IS a baby gift, and everything for babies ought to be pristine. Nevertheless, I did not send the box back and demand another, because time was of the essence. I do think you should know how baby gifts are being stored there at your warehouse, and, perhaps, make some improvements!"
2,Overrated,"This book is not as great/classic as it is proclaimed to be. I look at Alborough and Boynton books before I look at this one. The art is horrible, its too european (mummy), and too blonde haired and blue eyed. My daughter likes it, but not as much as her other rhyming books."
3,Guess you can't please everyone!,"Looking at other reviews, it looks like I'm in the minority here, but my son doesn't really like this book.I'd bought it for him when he was around a year old - at the time I figured that maybe he was too young for it (although he did enjoy other books), but at 21 months, he still doesn't like it. He likes the peek-a-boo, but that's about it.The only reason I can think of is that the soft colours don't really appeal to him."
5,Childhood Favorite,"This was one of my favorite books when I was a child. I guess it's because of all the fun things to do while your reading it. I'm almost 30 years old and my mom still has my copy from when I was younger. I just purchased it for my 15 month old son this past Christmas. We sit and read/play it together and then put it up when we're done. It's definitely not a book that you can let a little one toss around, but it's still a classic, in my opinion!"
4,small for a baby,"I have got to read the dimensions better on products I get! I do this a lot. It is much smaller than I had imagined. It is, as it says, 5 inches by 5 inches. I was picturing it bigger. It is a little small for my 7 month old. I will have to wait to really get use of it.Update: My son is now one year old and the small size is good in his hands. I just got the book out again and read it to him. He likes it a lot. He liked the bunny and other interactive bits. There is a little mirror and a piece of cloth among others. I do not know how long it will last being so small and somewhat fragile, what with the card stock, double-ply pages. But it is cute and I have a better view of it now that my son is older and able to play with it more."
4,Nice,"I loved this book when I was little. I still love it. So I bought it for a friend who recently had a baby girl. I like the boxed set, but I do wish the book was a little more durable. It seems to be made of glossy cardboard bound with one of those comb bindings you see on booklets made at Kinko's / other copy stores. I just wish it was a little more durable looking, but I guess that's what you get for such a good price. I still love the product and would recommend it - but would recommend that new parents also get a wood-book version of this book once their baby is of mouthing age! :)"
2,Cute but too fragile for little hands,"This is a really charming book. You can read the editorial reviews and other reader reviews for a plot precis. But, while the text is pitched at 18-24 months, and is full of much more interesting things to do than ""lift the flap"", the physical construction of the book is too fragile for little hands. So unless you have a very well-behaved, gentle little boo, this book will get torn to shreds in five minutes. I recommend more traditional, hardy, lift the flap books instead."
4,A classic,Fantastic book that spans generations. Read it to our kids and now we look forward to reading it with our grand children
2,pat the bunny,"I ordered a number of books for my godson who is 6months. I wanted pat the bunny, because of the good reviews on here and because it is a classic. I was NOT HAPPY when I recieved it, but I had opened it (so I couldnt return it) to get a better look because the book and box came very damaged on the sides. When he opened them today it was clearly his least favorite. I felt though that if I bought this book any later it would be very boring, even when he could actually read the words. Thank god I ordered huge board books of baby's first words,colors,and shapes, babys first animals, and baby's first 100 words cause he loves those. So for someone in a similar position, I'd buy this in person, or get a hardcover of it cause it damages fast."
5,Pat the Bunny,This is a must have for little ones. I had it for my children (now 30 and 26) and I bought it for my grandson. It is particularly useful to keep little ones occupied in church.
3,boxed set contains the Plastic Comb book - beware,"I ordered the boxed set version of this book because I read other reviews saying NOT to purchase the ""plastic comb"" version because it was too flimsy. The boxed set says it contains a ""paperback"" book, so I thought that was different from the plastic comb. Unfortunately, it's not. The plastic comb version, along with the bunny toy, come in the boxed set. The book is adorable, but I don't think it will last beyond a couple of drooly-mouthed chewing sessions. I'm disappointed -- should have gotten a board book instead."
2,not sturdy enough for young hands,"At 7 months old my child would have this book in pieces. I bought it (in the box) and when I took it out and discovered how flimsy it was I immediately knew I made a bad purchase. I decided to try anyway. Nope not gonna happen. Maybe she is too young still although she is into peekaboo, turning pages, feeling textures etc. I hope that she will still be into these things by the time she has a more delicate (relatively) touch."
3,Eh...,"It's a cute book, but very dated. Not very sturdy either. I cringe whenever my son reaches for it, but that's not too often, as it doesn't hold his interest very well."
1,Waste of money,This book was a waste of money for $9.99.There are better books in the dollar store than this. I am thinking of returning it back but shipping might be a hassle as I never returned an item in Amazon before.
1,"I know it's a classic, but I really don't care for it","I know it's a classic, but I really don't care for it. I find the book fairly uninteresting and the illustrations dull. Our baby just doesn't respond to this book as much as with other books.I think that there are much better books out there with much better content and illustrations."
1,Pretty Boring,"I bought this after having purchased and read ""Wet Pet Dry Pet Your Pet My Pet"" by Dr. Seuss and ""Touch and Feel Home"" by DK Publishing. Needless to say, my 9 month old could care less about Pat the Bunny as it's not nearly as ""interesting"" to him as the other books are."
1,disappointed,"I was born and raised in another country, so I didn't grow up with this bunny, but I heard so much about it and was told it's a classic. I decided to purchase one for my son. I have to say it's a major disappointment because 1) it's poorly made that's not strong enough to sustain an infant's pulling, chewing, and abusing, 2) the sharp edge of the book always seems to hit my son's face (I'm afraid it will scratch his eyes one day...), 3) the fabric in the peek-a-boo page is very weak that it probably will come off in a few months, 4) the smell of the flowers is so storng (considering I try to buy everything organic and without perfume), 5) Daddy's scratchy face? it's a piece of sandpaper which is so rough that I would not let my son touch it in case it hurts his soft skin. Overall, I think it might have been a great concept in 1940, but time has changed and so should the construction of the book itself."
2,"Wonderful book, but it is NOT a ""BOARD BOOK""","We received a copy of Pat the Bunny for a baby shower. My daughter loved the first book, but it was a small paper-back, plastic-spiral-bound version. When it was finally destroyed beyond repair, I started my search for a more durable copy. I found this one and purchased it because it said it was a board book. (To me, that meant it was a hard-cover with hard pages.) I was very disappointed to open the book and find it was still the same paper pages and plastic spiral binding. We've had it for 2 days, have read it twice and already had to put the entire group of pages back into the spiral binding. Absolutely love this story and will continue to read it with my daughter and future child, but I sure wish someone would make a true board book version."
1,Not the board book version,"These are great books, but.... I expected the board book versions for my toddler son and the light cardboard with pokey plastic binding was a real dissapointment. There's no way these books will hold up to the demands of my kids. I put them away for read with mommy time only."
3,Wish the book can be more sturdy.,"My daughter (2 years old) loves this book but I will have to replace it soon because all the pages easily came out of the ringbinding (with her help of course). I have re-assembled it thousands of times but now the ring binding is strecthed out and does not want to hold the pages together. Not a book that will last through more than one child in my experience, if they make the book with a solid hard cover, I have yet to find it."
4,Pat The Bunny,My daughter LOVES both the book & the stuffed animal. The stuffed animal is smaller than I thought it was from looking at the product info though.
5,"Children will love the pictures, and touching the story...","This was my daughter's first book. I had hoped to save her copy for my youngest daughter, but she wore it out, and ripped the pages. So, I bought a new copy and both girls still love reading it together. It is a timeless classic that will always appeal to the toddler's sense of touch.This would make a great shower gift for baby and I give it 5 stars because it is fun to read and feel."
5,Touch and Feel,This book was given to my daughter as a gift and I must say that this book was a big success to my 2 year old daughter and my 3 year old son. They love the book so much that not one day goes by without us reading the book together. It is a fun book for babies as well. The touch and feel is what makes this book fun to read and fun to play with as well. We love it and we are so sure that you will too.
2,Not durable,"We received this book as a gift. It has adorable illustrations with a great vintage feel, and my toddler twins loved the activities ... but I neglected to take it away from them after we finished reading it (because you know how it is with toddlers -- take something away that they like? and listen to tears for ten minutes? not likely!) and in about fifteen minutes, they had torn it completely apart. The comb spine style of book is NOT durable in the hands of toddlers!"
3,Needs better construction,"My son does love this book...especially the peek-a-boo page. However, I don't know why it's not constructed better. This book was about $10, and the pages are a thick paper instead of board book material. Since this book is geared towards the little ones, they really should make this into a board book. How much more expensive can that be? There are other touch and feel books that are board books that sell for $5 or $6."
5,A Classic Book,"This is such a timeless classic! However, I do have a complaint regarding the packing -- the box was broken on one corner, resulting in a bent page. Perhaps some bubble wrap would help in future mailings of this book and others that come in their own box."
5,Best book for baby,My 3 year old loved this so much as a baby that I had to get a new one for my third DD. The pages were so worn from their little hands doing everything in the book - it is amazing to watch them learn what to do on every page! You will not be dissapointed.
2,Crap!,"I gave this book to my daughter for her first birthday. Due to the cheap binding, she took it apart on the first day! The pages inside are interesting, so I'll give it two stars for that."
5,My baby loved this book,"I began reading this book to my baby at four months. She absolutely adores it and turns all the pages. She was able to pat the bunny right away and over time do all of the activities- except waving which we are working on now at almost eight months. Her favorite is the peek-a-boo activity. If she is across the room and I get out this book, she comes crawling over as fast as she can to read it along with me. By far, this is her favorite thing that we've given her!"
3,good book,My little girl loves feeling the different textures in the book. I only wish it was bound a little better as the plastic booklet binders don't hold the pages in too well.
4,Baby & Nana love Reading!,"This has been a favorite book in our family for a long time. Now, sharing it with young grandchildren, it has become part of our tradition."
5,Classic children's book,I try to give one of these books to each person I know who is having a baby. It is a great children's book with tactile pages and simple ideas.
5,A wonderful book!!!,"Wonderful memories of reading this book to my daughter from her 18 months of age and older. It kept her attention thoughout, a short story and fun to read to her. She absolutely loved interacting with the peek a boo page, the soft bunny fur and putting her finger through mummy's ring as well as feeling daddy's scratchy face. I can still smell the scent of the flowers!!!"
3,"nice concept, needs better execution","my kids (now in their 40's) had this book and loved it. i got it for my 12 month old grandson. the current version is cheaply made, with sharp corners. the material is lightweight, and it looks as though it will fall apart soon. the old version was made of heavy coated cardboard with rounded edges and corners.also, i guess the story is a bit dated now, as there are so few mothers with wedding rings, and daddies are often absent. oh well"
5,BRILLIANT!,I love this book to bits! I am 21yr old art student and I am doing a painting relating to my childhood and the wideeyed wonder I used to view the world with. I began thinking about my favorite books and this one is by far the most memorable. Its so heartbreakingly wonderful - I haven't seen one for well over 10 yrs now but I could still describe to you every page.
5,Pat the Bunny,My one year old just loves doing all of the activities in the book. One of his favorites!
1,Pat the Bunny Review,"I thought this would have been a great book for my infant/toddler, but was very disappointed because it is not a sturdy board book. Instead, it is a regular paper back book with slightly thicker pages. This book requires extra gentle care and is not good for children at a stage where they want to touch and feel the book, as the title suggests."
1,This book stinks!,"How dare Amazon sell a scented book without a warning of some sort in the description?!?!? It smells like perfume and made both my husband and I nauseous the second we unwrapped it. Also as mentioned by other reviewers, the construction is flimsy and I doubt this book would last a second if I actually gave it to my toddler. This is the first thing I will ever return to Amazon."
1,the book was pointless!!!!!!,I was looking for a book that has touch and feel for my baby and this book said it did but was the most rediculos book ever!!!!!
2,Comb binding is awful,"I bought this book for my 9 month-old son, but my 3 year-old son commandeered it for himself. Both boys love the simple, interactive book. However, I purchased the deluxe edition board book in the hope that it didn't have comb binding as other versions did. Unfortunately, it did come with the comb binding. The cover fell off completely and immediately. We reattached it a couple of times, but quickly got tired of it and now just read the pages loose without a cover. I know that the publishers are trying to evoke the vintage feel of the original version, but the comb binding really is awful and has been abandoned in today's children's books for a reason. Random House, please just make this into a regular board book without the comb binding! ""Pat the Bunny"" is a great classic story, but we can still get the vintage feel through the words, pictures and colors."
5,Very Educational & Entertaining,"I have a 5 month old baby girl, I have been reading to her since before she was born. She was born nearly one month early, and because of this in some areas she is behind. However, I am proud to say that alertness is not one of the areas. Pat the Bunny really seems to amuze her. She tries to reach out for the bunny, so I take her hand and rub it on the bunny, she just loves it! Some of what I have saod may not apply directly to this book, but, Pat the Bunny is a keepsake, and every child in the world should have a copy. If you haven't read it to your baby because you think he/she may not be old enough, take my word for it!"
1,Poor quality,"I bought the plastic version, not realizing that that meant it was VERY cheap. Everyone knows that a baby wants to grab/touch (isn't that the point of the book?) but this book doesn't hold up to that. We JUST got it today and it was read once and the binding has torn and looks horrible. The bunny came off in large pieces...ahhhh.. not what I want to happen when my baby touches it and puts it to his face. Also the mirror is horrible- he put it to his face but u can't even see clearly in it- puke. Speaking of puke....the perfume smell is horrible. I wonder if the hard cover is as bad? I quess I will never know. Cute concept, but poor construction."
1,falls apart--had to return,"This book fell apart and I had to return it. Don't buy this book if you are thinking it is sturdier than the original, smaller version. I thought because it is described as a boardbook, that meant it wouldn't have the silly plastic spiral bounding. Well, it still has the plastic spiral bounding, it's just inside and spirals through the hardcover. The problem is that it repeatedly came out of the outer hardcover--i couldn't get it to stay together so I returned. My second-born can just read the older, smaller version that is already roughed-up. I love this book in general and it is great for babies/toddlers, but I just wish they would make it as an actual board book."
3,"Okay, but over-rated.","I bought this book for my daughter for Christmas. I read all of the reviews and thought that it must be a really nice and special book. The book is okay, but for the price, I expected more. It's spiral-bond and not very good quality. I highly doubt that it will hold up to the use of a small child."
1,The binding comes loose,Don't buy this. I thought buying the deluxe edition would prevent the pages from falling out and it does not.
1,JUNK,This book fell apart and the squeaker broke in the first week of having it!! DO NOT BUY! We only read it to out 4 month old - so adults were handling it alone and the binding is thoughtless. I can't imagine if a child were to want to/try to read it. The publisher need to rethink its product. If I could return it I would. JUNK!!
3,"cute book, cheap construction","This is an adorable book, but I don't see it lasting long once an infant gets a hold of it! It's rather flimsy and made of thin cardboard. Too bad they didn't make it of higher quality and to last!"
2,Opportunity missed,"Jacob's ""Music for a Festival"" is rarely performed in its entirety, sadly it is not on this CD.The use of a tuba in lieu of a bass trombone in the brass choruses does not work well timbre wise, particularly in the Finale. The ""band"" movements are marred by excessive cuts in the music especially the Overture, almost a third of this movement is cut out, likewise the minuet & trio. Given that the the brass choruses are complete distorts this work further.The playing is precise and some quality sounds are made, the air is an excellent example,however due to the truncations an opportunity for a first class recording of the work was missed on this occasion.The CD suffers from an excess of tracks that should have been left out instead of being crammed in at the detriment of other pieces."
3,"Great tone, but where's the music?","I bought this CD specifically for the Artunian Concerto, which I am currently studying. While the solo was full of tone, and impeccable intonation, I found the interpretation lacking excitement. In my opinion, and my trumpet professor's, this style calls for bravura--not pedantic strict time, and all legato articulation."
1,Terrible Book,"This may be the worst book for anyone interested in using lettering in ceramics. This author spends very little time offering any actual techniques and conversely uses the novel as a arena to showcase the mediocre works of her and her friends. The works included in this text by no means represent the state of contemporary ceramics. If you are thinking of purchasing this book, you are better off buying Paul Scotts text, Ceramics and Print."
1,cheap crap,"I bought a new heater with this blower installed, within 3 weeks it was unbelievably noisy. I should have taken it back to the store where i bought it but its too heavy. I ended up modifying it myself, which lasted about 2 winters then it was back to noisy. I bought an entire new blower unit to replace the original, it was just as noisy from the moment i installed it..... again i had to modify it. I have the old one still and will repair it once again. If you don't have the know how to modify this blower i suggest you buy a different product, otherwise you will have to deal with LOUD banging noise, metal on metal it sounds like. This blower is poorly designed and cheaply made."
2,Procomm Attachment,I just purchased the stove and it already had this blower installed at the factory. I have to say for as little circulation it sure does make noise. I expected to not hear the fan and it sounds like metal on metal.
4,Lots of Heart,"This is one of Mr. Earle's finest. He displays, once again, his wide range of musical styles and his ability to write great lyrics. Many good songs including Taneytown, Fort Worth Blues, an homage to Townes and Van Zandt, and Telephone Road, a finger snapping tale of finding solace at the local rockin' juke joint."
5,There is not a bad song on this disk,This is a remarkable follow-up to I FEEL ALLRIGHT. Earle is becoming better and better.. I cant stop listening to this music!
5,One of Mr.Earle's Best Albums - BUY IT NOW!,"Steve Earle goes places with his songs that most songwriters only dream about. Truly one of the greatest artists in music today, and this album is one of his best. Lyrics so precise and poignant that you'll have a tear in your eye and a smile on your face. There's no pigeonholing Mr. Earle's music, but don't let that deter your purchase. You can't go wrong with this one."
5,"Steve Earle is an honest, sincere genius!","Quite simply, Steve is one of the greatest living songwriters and certainly the most original and insightful. If you haven't heard of him it's because he doesn't play by music industry rules. He takes chances and writes from his soul. His songs offer a vast array of music styles such that radio cannot find a place for him. If you appreciate intelligent lyrics with great instrumentation and some bad ass hooks, you'll love this album. Buy it, then buy the rest of his catalog."
4,this is a great album,"I don't usually listen to country. I'm an AFI Fan, for crying out loud! But, this is an exception. The writing is great! It really is nice to hear some REAL country instead of the redneck rock on the radio like Kenny Chesney. I can't really describe what it sounds like, you have to buy it."
5,Can't be described--must be listened to,"I don't know what made me buy this album, but I'm glad I did. Steve Earle's music is deceptively simple--his melodies, his lyrics, his voice. Each time I listen, I hear something that wasn't there before. It's been years since I bought an album I want to listen to again and again like this. After you've been listening awhile, you realize that Steve Earle is almost impossible to describe. You're no longer tempted to come up with label (Country-western Bruce Springsteen? American Billy Braggs?) and instead you just want to grab your friends and say ""Listen to this album."" It's beautiful and from the heart, hauntingly bracketed by Come Back Woody Guthrie and Fort Worth Blues on either end. And what's in between is a delight. No fake spirituality or phony stuff--just a lot of heart."
5,Final Seconds by John Lutz,This was my first read by this author. I found the book hooked me quickly and left me satisfied when finished. Lots of action and the occasional twist we all love. I am looking forward to reading more by John Lutz.
2,Not Very Well-Done,"This is a thriller that is not so thrilling. I found the writing to be formulaic, contrived and unrealistic. It's one of those books seemingly thrown together with only cursory attempts to develop characters, setting or a plot that had some realism to it. Just a hackneyed boiler-plate book. Sorry -- two stars."
3,Worth to pass an idle time by,"It's the usual bomb scare story, but this time, the people who uncovered the terrorist/bomber are people who were both ex's - ex-FBI and ex-bomb expert. How they got through, or rather behind the authorities in solving the case takes a big part of the story. I like the factoring in of the ex-bomb expert's wife - it makes him seem more real, more human. I'll definitely check out John Lutz's other books, but just like this one, I'll read the reviews first."
2,Dated,"Haven't finished it. It's dated and too much about bombs and explosives for me.Supposed to have won Edgar, but I won't know why til I finish it someday."
3,Awful staging of wonderful music.,"I won't bother to repeat any of the historical information on this very musical opera. I enjoy Baroque opera, both Handel and Vivaldi especially.But the staging and costumes were just horrible!! True fright wigs, awful dresses, no sets, lighting cast on screens which made the actors look weird. Terrible."
4,"Bizarre costumes, funny wigs, enjoyable acting.","This performance of ""Agrippina"" (1709) by Georg Friedrich Haendel (1685-1759)is a delight for the sight. Bizarre costumes, funny wigs, etc. Veronique Gens as Agrippina appears beautiful and has a great presence, worthy of this role. Her arias ""Ho un no che nel cor"" and ""Ogni vento"" has a sublime beauty. Ingrid Perruche as Poppea has many talent with the gorgheggi and her acting is really wonderful, many natural. The countertenor Phillippe Jaroussky as Nerone had a superb acting, too. His aria ""Quando invita la donna all`amante"" is very sensual and enjoyable. Only Nigel Smith as Claudio, for me, wasn`t so natural in his role, although he has a powerful voice. This performance is a treasure. I really enjoyed it."
3,Could Be Better,"It's always a good idea to save the oral history of those who have experienced an unusual occurance in our past. Although I enjoyed the book I kept waiting for ""something different"". I guess I've read so many reports/books/histories/newspaper articles on the subject there's nothing new to learn. I had an uncle who was a guard at two different camps and a grandfather who used German POWs on his farm so this is a subject well known in our family. This book might be good for ""newbies"" but not much help to real researchers on the subject. I would recommend it to my son's eighth grade history class. I did find the parallel's between the treatment of two groups interesting and am actually proud of the effort the U.S. made to comply with the Geneva Convention."
2,Good Concept-Poor Effort,"I loved the idea of an oral history of WWII POWs. I immediately picked up the book . . . but was soon disappointed. Carlson, a history professor at Western Michigan University, lost my respect at the first line of text, where he cite's Patrick Henry's regret that he had but one life to give for his country. This quote, of course, belongs to Nathan Hale, hung for spying on the British. History professors ought to know better. Carlson waisted an opportunity to explore the deplorable conditions of American POWs through unnecessary repetition."
2,Photos and map included,"This book contains an interesting selection of photos of German and American prisoners, then and now; also a map of the United States showing hundreds of places prisoners were held. Some interesting facts emerge such as German prisoners held in Mississippi camps working in swamps and cotton fields, suffering malnutrition,and in the words of one ex prisoner, being ""treated no better than the blacks we were working with."""
1,Complete?,"I would expect alot of do-it-yourself information in a ""complete"" guide to remodeling. Disappointing in that respect. A fairly general discussion of thinking about, planning, and hiring a contractor to do your remodeling. This book will go directly back up on the auction site for sale."
3,A Good Historical Document,"This is an excellent source of historical information (although not up to date), well edited and produced but not the whole story, not by a long shot even. The magic of Anfield's moments of glory comes from many many moments strung together by the golden thread of destiny, these moments were not covered in their entirity. So for this to be a definitive history of the phenomenon that is Liverpool F.C., more work is needed on this aspect; more footage and more analysis of the conditions surrounding and unfolding within pivotal matches in each season. An update that includes the unique achievement of a 5th UEFA champions cup (maybe a 6th this year), and more focus on the central figures of that amazing 70's team as well as current stars."
4,Great History of the Greatest Soccer Club in the World,"The title says it all. This is a must for fans of soccer. Liverpool, the most successful club in English football, and one of the most successful in le monde. Gives a thorough background; goes through all the periods and all the `Pool legends.The one thing missing, and it should come out is a new release is the great Champions League win over AC Milan in 2005."
3,Good album but not the best by the Innocence Mission,"The Innocence Mission is one of those groups that, on certain occasion, I find their sound flawless (namely 'Birds of my Neighborhood'), which is why it was something of a let-down to hear the tracks of 'We Walked In Song'. While the songs are, as to be expected, beautiful, lyrically-rich and enjoyable to listen to, these songs just didn't blow me away as much as some of their earlier albums have. Just my 2 cents."
4,We Walked in Song,Pretty good album of a group I've been following for years. Don't know how I missed it when it was first released but I think my collection is now complete.Thanks.
4,The only low profile Business card book with 160 card capacity!,"The book itself is ok, but the real reason I bought this was for the 160 card capacity of the pages inside. Which are removable! So I was able to put the plastic pages in one of the Business Card books I already had which had a more supple leather exterior as well as a notepad and pen holder inside. Samsill should think about just selling the plastic pages. To the best of my knowledge no one sells Low Profile vinyl refill pages for business card books, and this is the only company that sells books with 160 card capacity, most sell books with a 96, 72, or 48 card capacity."
5,Great tunes!,"Absolutely love this CD! The track ""I bought you a Plastic Star"" is my very favorite Holiday song ever."
5,"good, but nice!","funny story - i was drinking with some comrades saturday night and like a drinking vampire i somehow bit into this glass. the best way to drink a pils but be warned, it is fragile.overall, if not drank by a fool, 5 stars"
3,"NOT A REVIEW:Book ~200 pgs,not 350.","THIS IS NOT A REVIEW. There are only two authors. They are Saulpaugh and Mirho. Book is only ~200 pages, not 350. <end>"
5,Good book,Saulpaugh is an architect on the JavaOS project within Sun so the information is first hand.The book does cover the JavaOS fairly completely and covers how each component works. The writing is easy to understand and readable.I would recommend this book for anyone who is using or considering to use JavaOS or Java-based Network Computers in their work. This book will give you a good background on how everything works so you can understand the pluses and minuses of the technology well.
5,The Way in A Manger,"This is the most thought-provoking, energizing, and spiritual CD I have ever listened to during the Holiday Season... Many of the songs place you at the point in time of the savior's birth and you get to experience the thoughts, emotions, decisions, & questions faced by Mary and Joseph related to their precious son... A wonderful CD for parents everywhere, regardless of religious preference... I'm ordering CD's for my best friends and family."
5,"Makes you remember the TRUE meaning of ""Christ""mas",Great songs -- great artists -- We were looking for music that reminded us of the season -- This was our favorite last year.
2,Disappointing,"My 4 year old boy is going thru his monster truck phase. I don't know how it happened, since we parents didn't expose him to them, but there you have it. When the boy was disappointed not to be permitted to attend a local truck-a-palooza at the Pepsi Center, we offered to obtain some videos for him instead. We chose these because of their availability on VHS (the TV we like him to use is a VHS/TV combo).I'm sorry to report that there are tons and tons of minutes of footage interviewing drivers. If they interviewed the drivers and had the audio playing over footage of monster trucks doing their thang, it'd have been ok, but the camera just stays trained on these drivers for minutes at a time and that part is just so boring for little kids. Who, I must believe, are the primary target audience for this stuff.Also this is a 3-tape set that could EASILY have been compacted onto one tape as each individual tape is only 30 minutes long."
5,Buy this CD for yourself. Buy this CD for every one you know.,"Curtis does not disappoint. He is the king of cool, the sultan of smooth. When you see Mr. Stigers live or listen to his CD's, you know he is passionate about his work, that he loves the music and that he puts everything he has into every piece. And he's got a whole lot of everything. Just fabulous. If you're a first time listener of Curtis Stigers, even if you never been a jazz fan, prepare to be converted."
4,good buy!,"Positives: It was easy to assemble! Works beautifully, and effective. It doesn't take up much space!Negatives: Gliding makes me a bit dizzy. Need to go slow. changing lines (hook/unhook) is difficult for me."
5,Lovely gift,I purchased these to go with my son and daughter in laws servings as a Christmas gift. They were delighted.The items arrived on time and were individual wrapped. Really lovely gift!
3,Dry Yuri Drama,"You really can't blame anyone if they decide that this series is not their cup of tea. While it may be a yuri story about young, nubile, Catholic school girls being angsty and dramatic with each other... it's a very DRY yuri story. Those who enjoy the easy going drama stories that focus more on the relationships between the characters and things like working on how they feel will find enjoyable viewing here. If you're someone who desperately needs their conflicts to involve some kind of external catalyst to keep things moving, this series will probably bore you to tears. Definitely for the niche audience who seeks out this kind of storytelling."
4,Excellent brand and quality,I have several kits from HQ and found their quality to be exactly what I wanted for...to keep the neighbors and household family members from complaining. I would recommend this product to any practicing drummer or parent who has a drummer in their life.
1,Are you Kidding me?,"This is an absolutly horribble recreation of the actual car. HW used an old, possibly Corvette, frame and engine mold for this piece. The body is proportionned wrong, and the motor is a V8. It's more then obvious that no one at HW ever saw a real GN, let alone looked inside. Hand this out as a joke gift to your Corvette buddies, otherwise move on."
4,8x8 Board,"The board is made out of a nice, strong wood.Three reasons this didn't get a 5star- Board size (listed below) 8x8- Marble bag strings have come out of the bag.- Pieces are hard to tell apart, depending on the lighting of the room."
3,Surprisingly decent but not for the hardcore heads.,"FIRST OF ALL... this is not for the fans of anything hard or gangsta. This is somewhat similar to that old school bubble gum rap that used to be performed by groups such as L'Trimm. The lyrics seem quite repetitive and often phony. (How can they have so much loot and so many cars when this is their 1st album?) Much of the subject matter seems quite pretentious and basically it seems like they're perping. But some cuts are cool such as ""Unda Pressure"" which has some tight guest artists."
2,Too Many Screws/bolts,"Assembly is time consuming and some bolts work loose over time. I also have the step out kit (porch), which I would rate one star. In addition to the aforementioned problem, the safety rail/handrail is in the line of fire. My son shot thru the rail in the first season, There are other, better boxstands on the market than Big Game. I have used this one 3 seasons, so I have had a lot of time to form my opinion"
3,"Good product, minor issues","Rock solid, well designed, engineered product. Spent many comfortable, secure hours atop this platform. Widen the ladder and it rates 5 stars."
2,Yelling?,"I don't really like the premise of this book. Baby bear isn't being gentle with his cat, so dad bear yells at him. Good lesson? Not so much."
1,Avoid If You're a Spike Fan,"This book takes place during the 7th season, when Spike is crazy and stuck in the basement. Everyone he comes in contact with, Scooby or not, insults and degrades him. If you have any hope that the soul matters to ANYONE, give it up now. As for what this book is about: Dawn. I'm sure that's enough to send most of you fleeing into the night."
4,An amazingly strong table top tripod,"I've been through a number of table top tripods. Most of them I try once to hold a point and shoot camera and have it collapse. So on a recommendation from a friend, I went with my friend Manfrotto since I've had great brand experience.The tripod itself is well made, much like Manfrotto's products in general. Looking at past reviews, I saw that people had great experience with SLRs and longer lenses, so I immediately mounted my 5D Mark II and Canon 100-400mm lens as a test. The heavy load held fine, and I was able to move the ballhead and position shots just fine.The only downside is the price. Like most Manfrotto products, you get what you pay for but it's hard to swallow $40+ for a table-top tripod. And theManfrotto 345BAG Tripod Bag for 345 Table Top Tripodis $25 too. This does fit in a pocket and won't take up room in your camera bag.I'm happy that I got this tripod, but honestly, if it wasn't on sale I wouldn't have gotten it."
3,Excelent for its size,"This is NOT the tripod that works with the extension. The ball head will not unscrew from the legs. Unscrewing the bottom nut allows the legs to fall apart. (Yes, I've taken it apart.) The tripod I thought it was would have gotten the full 5 stars."
3,Not really low,While it is a table top tripod it is about 4 inches above from the ground. It did not work for landscape or abstract photography.
4,Good buy,"Very well made sturdy product, purchased it recently and have been using it ever since, my D70s and a 18-70mm or a 55-200mm lens is easily supported by this tripod. Very compact and can fit in the carrying case easily. The only problem is that it attaching and detaching it to the camera is not easy, wish they had something else instead of a screw attachment."
2,great mini,"Great mini but I've only used it once....It wont hold vertical for heavy cameras but otherwise its the best constructed mini tripod ever, although I probably would just use my shoe if the situation presented itself"
3,Communication??,"This book is not easy reading. Do economists live in another world? I read a paragraph to my wife, an English school teacher, and she said that it was very poor English. The author and the school were he teaches, is very prestigious."
5,"Chees and bacon heaven in the makin""",Delicious easy to make great product for busy momsenjoyed with Broccoli added too
4,Pretty tasty - easy;,"Not as good as my homemade, but sure saves time when in a hurry. They taste good, not overseasoned, recipe doesn't need adjusting. Go for it!"
2,TOO MUCH SEASONING,"I am sorry I bought a dozen. The product tastes good the first time but then it becomes boring the second time. And by the third preparation the smell all over the house becomes objectional. I was hoping we would eat a box a week, but the onion taste and smell is so strong it stinks up our whole house for the day when we prepare the item.I bought on a subscription order basis but cancelled because of the overly strong seasoning.I also bought the Skillet Fries and am really sorry I did. They have the same seasoning and just as strong. I fixed half a box and after re-hydrating tried to rinse off a lot of the season but it didn't work.It will take a year or more for us to get rid of these. Probably give some to the postal workers homeless food collection at Thanksgiving.I wrote the company regarding reducing the seasoning but have had no response as yet."
5,Coleman Cable 04635 Single Outlet Surge Adapter,it great for when you need a small surge adapter and not one ith more plug in it easy to carry because it small
5,Only Wheel Cleaner I Will Use,I've used this on all 7 of my cars over the past 10 years with success. It cleans well and doesn't damage the rims. Will not use anything else.
2,Terrific glasses but horible packaging,"Before purchasing, I read other reviews indicating there was a risk of damage during shipment, but the brand, size and price drove me to take the risk. Can you say worst case scenario? All four glasses were broken into small pieces. The Lenox packaging is barely suitable for carry out retail, and incredibly poor for shipment. Each glass was NOT individually wrapped. There was no tissue or cushoning material within the Lenox package or surrounding each glass, as another reviewer had noted.Unless Amazon requires Lenox to pack them for shipment, do not repeat my mistake! I can't for the life of me understand how anyone in the shipping department could have believed they were adequately protected."
1,Amazon STILL doesn't know how to ship them,"Judging by the picture on the box, these glasses are beautiful. However, the large pile of shattered crystal I have received both times has been rather disappointing.Amazon has sent these glasses to me twice, both times with the same result. They simply place the Lenox box within an Amazon box. The Lenox box is packed well within the Amazon box, but the glasses have no padding or dividers within the Lenox box. They smash each other to pieces during shipment. I would love to have these glasses, but I have yet to receive even one intact.Amazon has been very responsive and helpful with the returns. My only complaint is with the method of shipping."
1,Inadequately packed for shipment,I echo others' experiences. Amazon needs to wrap the glasses individually inside the box before shipping. There wasn't even adequate wrapping in the outer box. But the one glass (of four) that arrived unbroken was elegant and exactly what I wanted. The other three were smashed into many pieces.
1,Don't waste your time,All four glasses arrived broken. They are not packed for shipment. I have tried three times to get Amazon to refund my money but I have had no luck. Heed the warnings!
1,The glasses are fine; Amazon doesn't know how to ship them,"3 of the 4 glasses arrived broken. The UPS delivery man was a bit humiliated to hand over a box containing obviously broken glass. I should have listened to the other reviewers...the packing for these is all but non-existent. I would say, ""Don't waste your time."" If they had arrived intact, they would be fine, although I think 6 oz. is pretty large for martini and martini-type drinks."
1,A waste of my money,"When I see the word ""toolbox"" or ""blueprint"" in the title of a book or DVD, I expect that I am going to learn clear, practical techniques and exercises I can use with my therapy clients. This DVD is a presentation of a lot of theory, and it's not done in an appealing way. The author begins by telling her own personal story, which I didn't find helpful or all that relevant to the topic. Then it shows the author talking about her theoretical model of anger with a group of people sitting in a circle. She's basically lecturing at them, not interacting with them. Every now and then the camera shows one of these people, and they look like they are sitting there feeling trapped and bored to death. I must admit that I didn't watch the entire video, because I couldn't stand to continue after about half an hour. Honestly, it took a lot of patience to last that long. Maybe it suddenly changed into the most amazing thing ever, but if it did, I would be very surprised. A big waste of money."
3,Good information but nothing I could use to facilitate DV groups with that I didn't already have.,"I facilitate Domestic Violence groups and was hoping to find some new material, or old material presented in a new way. I didn't find anything that was really new to me, but there was some useful stuff and I don't feel it was wasted money."
2,For individual use only,"This product arrived with a footer that said 'for personal use only'. No mention of this was made in relation to this product on the Amazon web site. This is problematic since I bought it to show a group. So we're not getting off to a good start here. I wonder, how shall I deal with my anger about this?"
2,Didn't keep my Greek DVD either,"Sadly, I am among the many people who loved Josh Groban's voice but found ""Live at the Greek"" not worthy of keeping. His voice in this concert is very strained and that's what I had to do (strain) to watch it through to the end. One thing for sure, it's LOUD and boisterous. It's also visually dark and boring. Just because it's loud and flashy doesn't mean it's exciting. The problem is that the concert's star can't seem to hold it all together. Believe me, I'm not happy saying it either."
1,A Big Waste of Money!!,"I too was foolish enough to rush out and buy Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" before Christmas. Actually I patiently waited until Christmas day to play the DVD for family and friends. What a tremendous letdown! We all sat in front of the TV to watch Josh and within minutes we were all doing something else. Groban's voice was very, very nasal, like he was singing through his nose. Everything about the concert was disappointing. Just because people in the audience were screaming (constantly) doesn't mean it wasn't BORING as heck. Who thought up the idea of the screen in the back?? Although we had some of it in Groban's first concert, at least it was appropriate for the song he was singing. This time the scenery moved, flowed, popped. Sophomoric. Wish I could have gotten a refund for my DVD set too. No such luck!"
2,Depressed in Seattle,"First let me say that I love Josh Groban and everything he's done. I love everything he's done up to now. The only thing that I'm thankful for with this latest PBS concert is that I watched it on TV BEFORE buying it. Maybe my expectations were too high (I actually expected to hear and see Josh Groban, not the noisy fans). His voice wasn't up to par (didn't sound clear) and don't get me started on how this thing was filmed! Josh deserves better. His voice is just too beautiful to be in this mess. If you have never bought Groban's stuff, don't start with this. Get the first CD or better yet his DVD/CD for the first concert."
2,Josh Groban at the Greek,"I am a fan and have all of Josh's CD's and I bought the first concert sets for Christmas gifts the year it came out. It's still my favorite of all time! This really HURTS, but I am disappointed with the newest concert, mainly because it's just not a best effort from a hugely talented guy. There were so few songs from ""Closer."" How can you mess up such a beautiful song as ""Alejate,"" and ""To Where you Are?"" Answer: Film it through the audience. It is some type of artistic expression to film through through a sea of waving hands? Two weak-sounding vocals, poor filming (did they do long shots from the Goodyear Blimp?) and the big arena add to my disappointment. I taped this concert but I won't be buying it. I do want to see what is next for Josh and look forward to buying it. Believe it or not, I'M STILL A FAN."
1,Keep the Earplugs Handy!!,"If you intend on watching Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert through you will need a set of earplugs. They'll Especially come in handy for the first half hour so you won't be doing all the cringing and suffering through the nasaly, poorly sung vocals. You gratefully will not have to hear it! Okay I'm being a bit sardonic here mainly because another reviewer told us to take the earplugs out of out ears (sarcastically assuming that anyone who rated this concert low wasn't listening). Well, I heard the concert through to the painful last moment. At the end Groban apologizes to the audience for the overhead lights and mikes, etc. He really should have looked directly into the camera and apologized to US for this terrible concert."
2,"Not a ""Keeper"" for me either","Although I never give much weight to reviews, I have a confession to make here, in that I agree that this is a very poor concert for Josh Groban. As soon as I watched my DVD I remarked that Groban was having a problem. I was lucky enough to have bought it at a store that gives refunds. Many do not refund money for used products regardless of the reason. I saw some of the genius, heard a bit of the beauty in his voice, but the faults were too many to overlook."
1,Alarmed by Josh Groban's Voice,"I bought my Live at the Greek DVD two weeks ago and was very alarmed at how badly Groban sounded. It looks as though he's not very capable of holding a normal tour schedule without his voice suffering. For a young guy in his early twenties he can't even rival old rockers more than twice his age! They have incredible touring schedules and sing in outdoor theatres more than once in their careers. Oh, and they don't lip sync either. People who sing on tour know all of the pitfalls and take precautions for it. That's what being a professional is all about. But to pawn this concert DVD off to me expecting a good review is foolish. I bought the DVD but I'm quite unhappy with it."
2,"Josh Groban, ""Live at the Greek""","Sadly I am also disappointed with my ""Live at the Greek"" DVD set. Of course the main issue is with his voice, his gorgeous voice. Everything that made Josh so appealing has been changed to suit the Pop world and it's apparently affecting his overall style. I don't think there would be many complaints from people if Josh's voice were still as lovely as in the past. Of course it isn't. I've read lots of the reviews and have to agree that his voice is ""nasal"" and strained in enough songs to make me cringe. Since he isn't a natural Elton John type performer, he shouldn't try to be. He didn't sell millions of records doing it either. I read where the ""Greek"" isn't selling well. There are obvious reasons for that and I hope the people who are responsible for the ""Greek"" pay serious attention to them. This of course includes Josh Groban too."
2,Dazed and Confused,"That's how I felt as I watched Josh Groban's newest concert, ""Live at the Greek."" Wow what a difference since the premiere concert. It seems like his performing style has reversed itself. Mature and suave in the beginning, Groban was a instant success with a well-focused voice that was beautifully showcased in more formal settings. The concert at the Greek shows us how young Groban really is. Unfortunately his voice seems to suffer for whatever strains he's been putting on it for the concert touring season. If you buy this set, sight unseen, with the expectation that you'll have a concert set to match the first, you're in for a major disappointment. This one is Big, Loud, and almost Garish."
1,The future Barry Manilow,"Josh Groban had much promise with a pretty good voice and youthful career path. Then something happened. Oh yeah, he went on tour with concerts. What used to be unique is now pretty bland. Even with all the outrageous screaming and groupie swooning, you just can't help but pay attention to his voice. Or should I say how bad it sounds this time. A friend of mine works at our city's theatre and once told me that Barry Manilow can still draw a crowd and sell records. Of course he's been in the business for 30 years so that's quite a feat for a bland, monotonous singer. This is what Groban is destined to become if he continues to record his concerts. I hear Manilow can still get the women to scream too. Does that mean we forget to listen?? Nah. Groban's really trying to heat things up in leather pants and jazzier settings. Problem is that his personality is dull and it all looks contrived, because it is. Groban really should get back to what he does best and that is to sing."
3,He IS better than this!,"I've seen Josh Groban in concert twice, once early in the tour and once late. It was a wonderful musical experience both times. His voice was always beautiful and it was fun to see how he evolved and grew as the tour went along. The sound you hear in the first half of this CD is NOT what I heard at those concerts. Who mixed/recorded this!??! The first several songs all sound like he was recorded through cotton balls! This is not representative of what I heard in person. I've read several comments on his web site that by ""tweeking"" your sterio it sounds amazingly better. I thought that's what the sound people are supposed to have done before it gets to me! Am I glad I bought this CD? Yes, it was worth it just to hear him do ""America"". However, I hope the quality control people listen to the next CD more diligently before it comes out."
2,No Excuses are Acceptable,"I'm not Josh Groban's ""friend"" nor am I an avid ""fan"" but neither one would compel me to write a raving review if I didn't truly like the concert. As for the ""Greek"" concert, I didn't enjoy it. Josh Groban is a highly paid performer, period. All performers start off young and they either make it or they don't. My OPINION is that this is the worst performance I've ever seen Groban do. As far as the rest of the reviewers, you're entitled to your opinions. Pro or Con, you have the right. You lose your objectivity when all you can do is slam other people. The recent reviews below did just that. I'm appalled."
2,Not Even for Josh Groban,"I can't lower my standards this much! Yes I'm a fan. I bought Josh Groban's first CD (3 copies), first concert DVD set (4 copies) and ""Closer"". I loved Josh Groban's singing so much the extras were shared with family members. I bought the ""Greek"" DVD/CD too. I watched it three times and decided The Greek is disappointing on every level. I agree with the numerous people here that Groban's voice is terribly affected and poor. I only found two songs enjoyable and none of them include the redux from his first concert. Who made that decision? The miserable camera angles, are diverting at the worst. The sound is really bad but considering the fact that Groban sounds nasal, I gave up anyway. I can't get my money back for the ""Greek"" DVD, but Goodwill was open today so I threw it in the bin. I hate to give up on Josh Groban completely but if he continues to release stuff like this, I'll be an EX-fan. I work too hard for my money to waste it."
2,Hate to Agree,"Although I find some of the reviews very severe, I hate to agree that Josh Groban's latest concert ""Life at the Greek"" is very poorly done. I bought it early in the release time and heard all the excuses including one on Josh Groban's own website that it was a ""defective disc"". I also attempted to get my money back from the company that promised to follow up and do so. That didn't happen. So here is my review. Josh Groban's voice is very poor and everything else follows. Only a couple of songs were true to his actual talents and abilities. The rest were very sadly disappointing."
2,Maybe Next time,"It's painful to read the reviews here. It's even more painful to agree with some of them. I love Josh Groban's singing and I truly fell in love with his first concert. That was the first time I heard his voice. ""Closer"" was very good with the beautiful ""Per Te."" But what happened to Josh here??? He looks like he's straining to give a good performance and it works sometimes but not all. Sorry to say, I'll pass up on the Greek. I am looking forward to what he does next."
3,Disappointed`,"I had such high hopes for Josh Groban's new cd and this doesn't live up to my expectations. It seems too contrived and Josh's voice seems ""pushed"" to limits."
2,Josh Groban could do better,"Anything that Groban has done in the past is better than his performance at the Greek. Luckily for me I watched the concert on PBS and recorded it then. I also decided that for the first time I wouldn't buy his DVD/CD. I'm not even sure if I want to keep the tape, it's that bad. I hope Josh Groban takes care of whatever issues are causing his voice problems. Although I'll still be around to check out his next CD, it seems like many more won't."
2,"I HATE to do this, BUT","""Live at the Greek"" was the first Josh Groban DVD that I didn't absolutely fall in love with. I got it for Christmas and was so thrilled to get such a terrific gift. Then I watched it and just couldn't believe it was the same guy. Josh, so handsome and with a voice to lift anyone up.....it just didn't happen at the Greek! I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, I just don't want to keep it with my other superior CD's by Josh. BY THE WAY, THE NUT-CASE BELOW NEEDS HIS MEDICATION!"
1,The Greek Concert is Badly done,"I watched only 20 minutes of my Greek Concert DVD and it was torment. Josh Groban is so talented and his voice so beautiful that it's had to believe he could sound so bad, but he does! I anticipated a wonderful DVD and CD to add to all the other Josh Groban items I already have, but this is a big disappointment. I haven't seen Josh Groban since the first concert DVD. He looks like he's gone funk. Actually I wouldn't care what he looked like if he just sounded as good as he has in the past. The Greek is very badly done and because of it, I'll be returning it. None of this makes me happy."
2,Mediocre at best,"I can't help but compare Josh Groban's 2002 PBS Concert to the latest one, shown in December 2004. In 2002 we saw a confident, talented man with a beautiful voice, performing with the music (and guests) in partnership. In 2004 all of that is gone! What we have instead is a failed effort to remake himself into a Star but at the cost of his voice. It almost seems like PBS and Groban filmed this concert as an afterthought. No wonder at some points he seems to be singing in the dark. Groban looks uncomfortable and aware that this is not his shining moment. His voice falters often. After watching the televised concert, I've decided not to buy this one. This is a great loss to me because Josh Groban was among one of my favorite new artists. If he isn't careful, his meteroric rise to fame will crash and burn just as quickly."
2,"Not Terrible, BUT","When you're not rich and don't have a lot of money to waste on relatively ""so-so"" DVD sets, there are expectations. Kind of like an expectation that the voice is good and reasonably listenable. I didn't find much on Josh Groban's concert DVD worth that. Since I already have his two CD's and they were worth it, I don't need this one. I watched this one at a friend's house and decided after watching hers."
1,Hmm.,"I've never seen the full DVD recording or heard the full CD recording of this concert. I did, however, see Josh's Closer tour in Norfolk, VA earlier this year, and it was the one of the best concerts I have ever attended (a tie with Sarah Brightman's Harem tour). He sounded nearly flawless live, and usually does on his studio and other live recordings. I listened to the sample tracks of this CD here on Amazon, and he does sound nasal. Very nasal, which is very unlike Josh Groban. I'm wondering if maybe it was due mostly to poor recording, because I know from first-hand experience that recording can sometimes distort the voice. Because of this, I'm giving the RECORDING a rating of one star, not Josh Groban."
2,Reprise should Recall it,"I bought this for my girlfriend because she's a Groban fan and the look on her face when she watched it was very sad. She said Groban's website even has complaints about the ""defective DVD"". I actually watched a few minutes and Groban just sounds bad. No matter what the reason, it shouldn't have been sold like this. She found out that Reprise record co did it so they should recall it."
2,"Josh Groban's ""Greek"" is disappointing","I don't know if I'll be keeping my ""Greek"" concert DVD either. Perhaps because I don't find this disappointing performance acceptable. Of course we know it was LIVE---Duh. Add another DUH to the comments about the Greek being outdoors. The fact that the producers knew this ahead of time also shows they knew it could affect Groban's voice. The fact that they released it for sale knowing the nasal sounds were there is unforgivable."
1,"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","I'm saddened to say that I also returned my ""Live at the Greek"" concert DVD set. It was lacking in quality and under any circumstances I would not keep it (except if it were free, which didn't happen).I think Groban should rethink anymore ""live"" concert recordings and definitely avoid the outdoor theatre venues. It kills his voice.Glad to see there are some diehards out there. Groban will need them to keep his career alive if this continues."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"The typically excellent Groban is untypically bad on this DVD and the CD. It's generally a waste of money to have so many poor vocals on any music that costs bucks (Groban's obvious nasal problems and warbling are annoying at best). I agree that the camera filming is too erratic and poor. If you don't have all of Groban's CD's or his first concert DVD, select one of them. They're all excellent. Tread carefully if you want to buy this one."
1,"I'm NOT deaf, but it would HELP","Geez, talk about people in denial. This DVD is the worst thing I've seen or heard from Josh Groban. Like the MAJORITY here, I found it severely wanting. The vocals by Groban are terrible, with the nasal weakness quite obvious. Add the erratic filming, lousy sound and nothing else worth getting excited about. I returned my DVD within 4 days. I only had to see it once. Hope Groban realizes the large audience (beyond these fanatics) will not accept, or BUY such a crummy excuse for music or entertainment."
2,The Greek isn't Groban's best.....Try something else!,"I think it's inappropriate to slam other reviewers, but for those that actually state the facts as they see (and hear) the ""Greek"" concert, I have to agree that this isn't Josh Groban's best work. Whatever the reason for his poor-sounding voice this concert DVD isn't worth the money. If anyone hasn't yet bought any of Groban's music, I think they should definitely start with ""Josh Groban in Concert"" his first concert DVD set. That concert was also live but the sound was absolutely perfect and Groban's voice was also. This is what made Groban a mega-star and he absolutely earns the accolades. With the Greek everything is out of sync including Groban's voice. Too bad because he is a terrific vocalist. Hopefully new fans will pass up the Greek and buy either his first CD or first concert DVD set."
2,A Big Shock and Disappointment,"I've never been so surprised as when I watch Josh Groban's, ""Live at the Greek."" My jaw literally dropped! He went from being a classy guy with an overwhelmingly gorgeous voice to a dressed down Pop- or something warbler. There were moments when I heard that glorious deep voice but they came and went without any consistency. I wanted very much to love this concert as much as I did the first, but I just came away being really puzzled. Why change something that was so wonderfully successful? Well, that question can only be answered by Josh Groban himself. The wonderful songs that he recorded on his first CD and ""Closer,"" were sung in different arrangements that failed to keep me interested. The real beauty in the entire program was Lucia Micarelli. She reminded me of what Josh Groban used to be--a class act. I recall an interview for the first concert when Josh said he was a ""Perfectionist."" Hmmm. Could have fooled me!"
2,Remember when it Rained??,"I do. It was last night when I watched Josh Groban's concert. It looks like he's transforming himself into a Pop star, but with the classical kind of songs. Very different by far! It just doesn't fit, kind of like Bruce Springsteen singing opera at the Met in a tux. Quite often the voice that made him famous was there, but sometimes very strained. I read all the reviews. By far the best advice I've seen is that you should WATCH IT ON PBS AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF!"
3,I am sorry to say only 3 stars,"Big fan since before Ally. I agree, camera angles are bad and erratic. I wish more from Closer had been performed. I also agree with those who said he sounds nasal on some songs. Oceano especially but I put that one down to the fact that he has horrible stage fright and knowing it was being taped had to add to that fear.I had to buy it because I have everything else, I enjoy it and will watch it again, however Sarah Brightman's Harem DVD is in my player now and it doesn't look like she is going to be dethroned anytime soon."
1,Sour Notes and Nasal Twangs,"That pretty much sums up the major issues I had with Josh Groban's latest concert DVD. What a huge step down from his first! Yes folks, this is the new and quite disappointing Josh Groban. He's making so many attempts to revise and change his image to appeal to a younger and hipper crowd. Problem is that his voice and true talent are taking a back seat. He can dress down and wear tight leather pants, but his clothes are not the real issue with this concert. His singing is not good at all. Even a frenzied audience can't pump up any energy into this dead fish. His vocals just keep floundering. I did accomplish a feat not yet equalled in Fear Factor. I actually listened to the whole thing. Then I took two aspirin and went to bed."
1,Live at the Greek is Torture. Period.,"If you really really enjoy punishment, then fork over your hard-earned money for Josh Groban's Live at the Greek. For reasons beyond my imagination, I got this DVD set for my Valentine's Day and it was just that...Torture. I thought Josh Groban was a wonderful singer but I only had his first CD, which was marvelous. At the Greek his voice is truly bad. I don't enjoy pain, so I won't be getting anymore of Josh Groban's songs."
2,Josh Groban's Greek Concert,"I also bought Josh Groban's Greek concert and was very disappointed. I was fortunate in that I was able to return it to the store and get a full refund (bought it at Sam's). While he does have more of a rock attitude and there are some loud things going on in the background, that was not why I was disappointed. Josh simply did not sound very well. I couldn't take it when he sounded so bad (and yes, it was noticably nasal). I love Josh Groban and in no way will turn away because of this one disappointment. I read where he is now working on a new CD and am eager to hear it. Josh does have a tremendous voice and it is quite beautiful. I just think this concert was done at a bad time. I read a few of the reviews and agree that his voice is much better in an enclosed theatre or a studio. Obviously his voice is affected by the night air as it was at the Greek, which is an outdoor ampitheatre. I really look forward to seeing what he does next."
1,"A PBS ""Great"" Performance??","Usually PBS's Great Performances are just that, GREAT. However, it is pledge week in the south so we must also get a repeat of Josh Groban's badly done ""Live at the Greek."" I saw it in December and never did a review then. I was just too disappointed to care. Now we get it again with all the whining. I'm NOT talking about the pledge beggers, but Josh Groban. His voice whines, grates, gets nasal and froggy. It's quite awful. Oh yeah, Josh Groban the musician doesn't distract me from his bad voice either. Early instant stardom has done him in. Many are willing to go to endless concerts and scream, which is good because of course, they can't HEAR Groban while screaming. After watching Live at the Greek all I want to do is grab the remote and turn on something less painful."
2,Never record the last 2 tour dates !!!!!!!!!,"First of all,I will say Josh Groban's voiceis a beautiful instrument.Unfortunatley,the record label he is underrecorded this CD / DVD during the last 2 concertsof Josh's tour. I am sure they wantedto have the lightingand sound exactly the way they wanted itby the time they taped the concert.Unfortunatley,Josh Groban's voice was quite strainedfrom life ""on the road.""I hope the record label,and the producers take this into accountin the future. They need to remember heis not a pop singer who's voice they can destroyto earn a few extra dollars.Sure, the music is well produced...But please, protect Josh's voice!!!!!!Well,at least Josh seems happy during the concert : )"
4,josh groban live,amazing singer and performer. this is a must have for a fan or someone who is just learning about him. a great overview of all the genres of music he can perform. a very likeable entertainer!
1,Grobie has left the building!,"How can anyone stand this performance? I used to be a fan of Josh, but now it seems that he lost his touch. He's trying too hard to be a mainstream pop star, and I personally believe that it does not fit his personality all too well. If Josh is really one of this century's vocal miracles, he will be one of those ""WAS"" singers of this century very very soon. I was gravely disappointed with Closer. This concert disappoints me even more, and I wish that if he was intent on remaining as a singer for the next few years, he should have stopped on his first album and waited a few years until his voice matures a bit. Now, he sounds horrible. And just so you would know, I WAS a Grobanite. Not anymore."
2,Josh Groban not very good on this one,"I don't really care WHAT the excuses are, Groban is really poor on this DVD set. His performance is below par for anyone but a senior citizen rocker. What do I expect? Something for the price. Didn't get it here, so I returned it. All the excuses in the world (from the so-called ""core"" fans) can't make this dog sing."
1,"Yes, Don't listen to the Whiners!!","With over 300 reviews and an average rating of 2-1/2 stars, I would say that the ""whiners"" are those who want you to ignore the facts and buy this DVD.I didn't read ANY reviews before I bought my DVD set. I didn't even know this site existed. I bought Josh Groban's concert set because I have all of his others. BIG MISTAKE. I too am completely at a loss at how bad this concert is. Of course, I'm not a Groban Groupie and don't go from city to city to see him sing live. Then again, I do have many, many copies of live concerts. They're truly great. This one isn't.So YOU certainly should not pay attention to the personal opinions of anyone. It's YOUR money and it's going to be YOUR purchase.I didn't pay attention to anyone's opinion when I bought ""Live at the Greek."" AND I didn't pay attention to anyone's opinions when I returned it to get my money back.I now have $30 more to spend on music that I will actually find worthy.I'm Happy."
2,Received my Concert DVD/CD today,"I watched my Live at the Greek concert the first time today, and I decided to post my review asap. As you can see, I am giving it less than a rave review. I'm completely disappointed because I paid $32 for this DVD and CD. What should a customer expect? How about a professionally recorded concert that does not have songs where the performer sounds poor. I noticed Groban's nasal tone too. It doesn't take a vocal coach to hear it. I read some interesting comments here: good--bad--not indifferent for sure. If you haven't bought this concert yet, don't let anyone here sway you and that includes ME. My best advice is that you go to a store that has a Demo, and check it out BEFORE you buy."
2,What's Happened to Josh?,"omg....his voice used to be so beautiful but what happened?? Has he gone too flashy and left his real talent behind?? I'm so sad to hear it because he was one fine guy and his voice was so gorgeous. Too bad everything I have that's good to say has to be written in the past tense because Josh doesn't sound or look so good any more. I'm waiting for his next CD, though and if that's back to his beautiful voice, I'll buy that one. As far as the Greek, it's not for me."
2,Very Disappointing and Not Like Josh Groban!,"I've been to two of Josh Groban's concerts during this tour and have loved both of them. I watched this one on PBS but didn't buy the DVD because it is NOT a worthy release for Josh. His voice is lovely and usually perfection. It isn't during this particular performance. I can understand why so many people were disappointed. I was too. If you love Josh Groban, perhaps it would be best to wait until his next studio release. I have everything he's done, and multiples of them too. I have to admit that I was at a loss as to why Reprise would release this one. I've noticed low reviews here and on Barnes & Noble. So there are many other sites and people from all walks of life who either bought it or saw it on PBS, and didn't care for it. To sae part is that Josh is a hardworking singer. Is singing is rarely like this. His concerts are terrific in person. This is not."
2,Waiting for Josh Groban's Next,"Our PBS station also showed Josh Groban's concert during their fund drive. It was then that I heard the infamous nasal sound in his voice. I also decided not to buy the DVD set because of all the voice issues he was having in many of my favorite songs. There were some nice moments like when he sang ""Per Te"", but I can to come to terms with the fact that I didn't like this particular concert. I am not completely turned off by his singing and I am looking forward to his next CD. I think that with time to rest his voice, without the annoying live audience, and with time to actually sing good songs, it will be worth the money. I truly hope so. Josh Groban was born with a beautiful voice. It would be a shame to lose all of that."
2,What happened to Josh??,"What happened to Josh Groban since his first beautiful concert? I didn't see his transformation into a rock star until I got my ""Live at the Greek"" DVD and it was a total disappointment. Just when I thought there was a singer out there with a VOICE too. Whatever Josh has decided to do with his voice it isn't good. Neither was this concert. It was just one long disappointment. I'm sorry to say that this is the first time I felt I wasted my money on a Josh Groban recording."
2,Josh Groban's Freaky at the Greek,"Josh Groban trying to be a ""rock on dude"" just doesn't seem right does it? Doin the Elvis thang wearing (he announces it) leather pants??? Uh, what's that?? Okay. Diversions. You're not supposed to hear his vocal problems and you're not supposed to pay attention to them because after all, he's Josh Groban wearing leather pants, beating the drums, joshing around with the audience. Did I say that?? Real freaky, dude. Of course sooner or later you can't help but notice that he really isn't singing very well. If he did, Groban could do the macarena, dressed in a bunny suit and I wouldn't notice. I would be paying too much attention to that wonderful voice and letting it carry me away."
2,What happened to Josh Groban??,"""Live at the Greek"" is so poor, I can't believe it. I played my DVD for the first time yesterday. I don't know what happened but Josh Groban's voice is really bad in this. It's noticably nasal and often strained. I had guests over later and they said the same thing. I have the DVD of his earlier concert so I just put that in and everyone commented on the inferior quality of this latest concert. I don't care about how he's dressed or the other elements of the concert. I really didn't notice that during the first few minutes of the concert. Lucky for me I bought it at Sam's and can get a refund. If anyone wants to hear what Josh Groban really sounds like, I recommend his first CD or first concert. I believe it's still being sold here on Amazon."
2,Poor Quality,"I am a consumate Josh Groban fan. When I watched the ""Greek"" performance, I wanted to cry. What a vast difference from the live performance that I saw in person. This taped performance is a technical nightmare. Many people have said that his voice sounds nasally. I hear it as more of a FORCED vibrato, and it sounds terrible. All of the concerts were filmed. I don't understand why they didn't just take the best performances from different shows and put it together to make it more of a documentary-style DVD. Make some lemonade out of those lemons. I suppose the ""Greek"" does have a certain attractive quality, but the poor vocals, sound and videography take away from any ""cool"" factor of the venue. I'd much rather see him perform in an empty corn field if it would bring back those beautiful vocals. The ""Greek"" DVD is a monumental disappointment."
2,Maybe Next Time!,"I have all of Josh Groban's CD's and initial concert on DVD/CD set. I did watch this one on PBS. The concert was not very good in my opinion. Josh does not look the same and I didn't care for the ""Greek"" at all. I'll look for what he does next. Perhaps he'll go back to his roots and do better material."
3,Live at the Greek,"I confess that I have a total of 3 copies of Josh Groban's first concert. I loved it then and I still listen to it. I watched ""Live at the Greek,"" on PBS last week and it was okay, but nowhere near the quality of the first. I think he filmed the first before he was 20, but his voice and stage presence were beautiful and I heard it all on the CD. The sound was wonderful. This concert was quite different and Josh voice isn't quite the same. It's still powerful without a doubt, but it just didn't have the quality. Perhaps it's growing pains because he's transitioned into a different type of stage personna too. I wish this could be a 5 Star performance, but I gave it three. Josh Groban still has a good voice."
2,"Josh Groban's Greek, Not a keeper for me either","I got Josh Groban's Greek DVD+CD set on Valentine's day. I can't say Josh Groban's music ""ruined"" my Valentine's Day. No one can do that. However, this concert is just so darned depressing I didn't enjoy it. LOL and OMG I'm so happy I didn't play it in front of my boyfriend. I watched it with girlfriends and all we could do is stare, then laugh. It's really, really, really bad.My mom watched it later and even she was laughing at how foolish these people in the audience acted! Like, get a life.Anyway, it's not good. Josh isn't even cute anymore and he sounds pretty crummy. This was just boring. It's true what people are saying here. It wasn't worth the money my boyfriend paid. I care too much for him to tell him that, so I'm writing it here. I hope people listen to the samples here and really think twice before buying this music."
5,What a treat!,"If you can't go to the live show again (and I did earlier this year!), at least you can enjoy this recorded version. Josh Groban is possibly one of the most gifted individuals of his generation. I was a singing teacher for 10 years and I am absolutely floored by the instrument that God gifted to Mr. Groban. And he has developed that talent in a way that is beyond parallel for a young man his age. If you like excellent tenor/baritone talents, you will LOVE this voice!"
2,A Disappointing Second Concert,"Josh Groban has talent beyond compare and a voice that is so beautiful it's hard to describe. So I'm absolutely shocked to hear a strained, sometimes nasal Josh performing in this concert DVD. I bought both concerts. The first (2002) was stunning in every way and Josh Groban was definitely impeccable. The ""Greek"" performance is flawed in many ways, including the aforementioned vocal strains. I also have issues with the change arrangements for songs he did in his first concert. With ""Canto Alla Vita,"" he starts on the keyboards with an introduction that sounds like scratching fingernails across a chalkboard. What was that?! The mind-boggling lighting that would make any rock band proud and moving scenarios shown on a screen behind him, just add more distractions. Does anyone really buy the ""Defective DVD"" excuse?? For those of us who paid the $29 pricetag, that's not even good for a laugh. Perhaps Groban's next CD will be better. I'm not sure I care at this point."
3,Wish I had stars in my eyes,"I wish there were 5 stars in my eyes so I could give Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert all of them. I'm sorry to say that this is the best I can do. While I think it was okay I have to acknowledge his voice problems and nasaly sound. The fact that there's only a few songs from ""Closer,"" and two are nasaly also is a big disappointment. The lovely violinist is a plus but not enough because it wasn't her concert, it was Josh Groban's. Whatever is the cause of the problems, hopefully they are taken care of because Groban's voice under usual circumstances is absolutely beautiful. The Greek concert just isn't up to standards."
2,Didn't Enjoy Groban's Greek concert,"I saw this concert on one of the many mind-blowing PBS repeats. I didn't enjoy it then and It hasn't grown on me. I wasn't very much impressed with Groban's vocals and even less impressed with the quality of sound and visuals (i really should call it the LACK of quality). Groban the boy-wonder is just leaving me wondering.....Why?? I agree that he is truly nasal in many of the songs, but that's not the only thing wrong---dead wrong---with this concert. The radical camera work, uneven direction, lousy sound, well---you can get the drift. I can't knock it down to one star because a couple of songs were decent thanks to the guests. Groban can't hold my interest without them."
2,Disappointing second concert by Groban,"I snatched up Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert because I loved his first one and all his CD's. What I thought I would hear was his glorious voice, but instead heard a nasaly, strained Josh Groban. How disappointing! I sent it back and got my money refunded. I'll check out Josh's next CD and maybe his voice will be back to great. I didn't keep the Greek because it just wasn't good"
1,Not much to say,"I used to like Josh Groban, but this DVD made me turn my back on him so completely. Somewhere in his giddy success he has lost the gift of touching hearts, now he's just a platinum singing machine that's powered on by his fame and the highly-placed crowd he's associated with. Very boring."
4,Josh is a keeper for me........,"I agree with one reviewer here.....why all the hate? I absolutely love LATG with only one complaint. I also prefer Josh's concerts to be indoors. Otherwise I thought everything else was quite worthy of watching. Josh has come into his own as a performer. He is more comfortable with the audience and is loving every minute of it. If anyone is a true fan of this talented young man than they would know that he doesn't care to appeal to the masses. He is making music that he wants to make now and is sounding better every day doing it. I happily support Josh Groban's journey, and I can't wait to hear more from him~~his music and voice will continue to uplift me."
3,This Concert has a Multiple Personality Issue,"Which means I won't be buying Josh Groban's DVD set for ""Live at the Greek"". He seems to be searching for his true style and he's still searching. This concert suffers from a multiple personality disorder. Is it Rock, Pop, or a Classical crossover? It seemed to be all of that and at the end of the concert I was just confused. A huge audience, and lots of flash. When Groban sings ""Caruso,"" we get the translation popping or floating on a screen behind him. During ""To Where you Are,"" we get views of hands waving flags. But where is Josh Groban? He's actually trying his hardest to keep his voice strong because the open air seems to have gotten to him. Josh Groban does have a terrific voice without a doubt. When his voice clears up we get the full beauty of it. But for mass appeal and to diminish the HUH? factor, he really, really needs to decide what his concerts should be when they grow up."
2,Regret that I Bought the Greek concert,"Oh good grief the reviews here are soooo......TRUE! I would have never thought Josh Groban could look or sound so bad either, but he did!! I bought the concert DVD/CD combo online before it was shown on TV and that was my mistake. But who would have ever thought that Josh would look and sound so bad?? What's happened to him, I'm not sure. His beautiful voice is very poor in the first half of the concert but that's not the only thing that brings me down. He just doesn't look like the cute guy he used to be either. All the screaming and other stuff is just stupid. I gave this to my grandma. I thought it was awful."
1,Stopped Watching after 30 minutes,"I was so excited to get this DVD and CD. I had ""Closer"" and kept my fingers crossed that Groban would do ""My Confession"" in concert. I didn't see it on the DVD or CD listing but that was okay. But as I watched I just sat there in shock because Josh Groban didn't look or worse of all didn't sound like Josh Groban! Well this concert is for the people who like loud, glaring music. I don't. As a matter of fact, that's what drew me to Groban in the first place. It was Pop music that was beautiful and so easy to listen to. This was not. Not easy to hear, not easy to watch."
2,"""Live at the Greek"" was a disapointment","I bought Josh Groban's concert CD and DVD because I love his voice. I also was mezmerized by his first concert in Pasadena. After watching my DVD of the latest concert I was amazed at how much he has changed. Of course it's been two years since the first concert, which is an eternity in a singer's life. I should have guessed there would be changes in his style of singing because he started so young. But I didn't really expect that one of those changes would be in his voice. Like so many others I couldn't bear hearing his voice sound so poor. Of course what you get on the DVD you also get on the CD. It could have been another knock-out seller. But until Groban takes care of his voice, I won't buy another concert. That's really the only problem I have with the Greek concert. But then that's really the only reason why I buy Josh Groban's CDs."
2,Groban's Voice not so Great anymore,"What I saw and heard when I watched Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" performance was a very affected performance. Although we got Josh Groban the piano player, solo drummer, leather pants wearer, stuffed animal bearer, we didn't get much of Josh Groban the great singer."
2,The new Josh is not as impressive,"Many have mentioned the possible technical defects on the DVD for the first few songs, but I actually attended Live at the Greek ... and let me tell you, he DID sound nasal early. And throughout the concert, most of his ""o"" vowels sounded very nasal. His Italian pronunciation is steadily declining, IMO. I also attended his concert in January, so I know it's not just a fluke thing that's happened to this concert. I can no longer listen to his renditions of ""Per Te"" live because I know they never live up to the one he did on his ""Closer"" album. That is the voice of Josh that represents the perfection that I always heard in him.He's still very energetic, with a great personality. The atmosphere is alive in this DVD. But the VOICE is why I listen to Josh ... and it's just not there like it used to be."
2,Mostly Disappointed,"Live at the Greek was a Valentine's Day present to me and I was thrilled to get it. Well the thrill lasted about two minutes into the concert, then the Thrill was Gone. I was really singing the blues when I heard Josh Groban sing. Then sometimes it was hard to see him with all the aggravating camera shots of arms and twirling glow-in-the-dark things. Thousands of screaming people. The whole nine yards. It was one big disappointment. The one shining star was Lucia Micarelli. She was beautiful and played with such emotion. She truly stole the concert from Josh Groban who was DOA."
2,Live at the Greek,"I didn't want to make a snap judgment on Josh Groban's new concert, so I watched a second time. Now I'm certain that I won't buy this one. Yes, Groban has become more of a Pop stylist but it just looks and sounds awkward to me. The sophistication that we saw in other performances is missing, replaced by lots of flash with little content. I honestly believe that Josh Groban's voice should be the highlight of his concerts. It's what millions of us fell in love with in the beginning. There's less focus on his vocal talent in this concert and all I can say is that's a big waste. My first impression was correct. Josh Groban is way too talented to make his voice secondary to his stage presence. I can't help but be disappointed."
2,disappointment,"I was shocked and disappointed while listening to this CD. Groban's voice sounded strained and tired. His previous CD's were tremendous but I was distracted by all of the ridiculous screaming and hokey hand waving/light stick show. I was embarrassed for Groban and his ""Grobanites"". With the exception of America, better versions of every song could be found on another of his CDs. I am a big fan of Josh Groban's music and I am saddened at the shoddy product that was produced. I'm hoping that the next CD is worthy of his beautiful voice!"
1,Absolutely AWFUL!,"I received Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" DVD set as a pre-Valentine's Day gift from my husband because he knows I enjoy Groban's singing. I am absolutely stunned at the changes in him. Has it only been two years since his first concert? This is truly the worst DVD set I've ever had from any performer. Groban sounds terrible, often froggy and nasal. He looks like he just threw sneakers and some old clothes on. Groban was so absolutely stunning in voice and performance style in the past that I couldn't believe it was the same man. Well, I can state with absolute certainty that I will NEVER ask for or buy another Groban disc again. This DVD was so difficult to listen to, it was almost painful. It was almost as difficult to watch. Groban may want to ""mix it up"" and pander to the screaming dunderheads in the audience, but filming it and selling this to others is a crime."
3,"Flawed, but not a total waste","After reading all the negative reviews, I was leery of buying this. But I did anyway and am glad. Yes, Josh sounds a bit nasally and congested. But I still enjoy his singing and I love his version of Paul Simon's ""America"". I just wish they had included ""My December"" on the cd. The concert is flashier than the one from ""Josh Groban in Concert"", but it's LA so what do you expect?"
2,Sorry to be Leaving Josh Groban Behind,"Many of my fiends and I instantly fell in love with Josh Groban when we were in college. His voice was so gorgeous and he had such style. Well, that was then. Today Josh sounds so lousy it's an unbelievable turn-around for him. His ""Live at the Greek"" album should never have been released with all the bad, nasal sounding vocals. Visually it's a miserable mess. I was in a Barnes and Noble bookstore recently and they were playing the CD in the store. Two women near me remarked on the nasal sound in his voice. Groban is still young and he can make corrections. However, it does seem that he is changing more than his voice. I'm not quite sure what audience he's trying to reach but it won't include me."
2,"All ""Reviews"" are Personal OPINIONS","Every single review here is personal opinion. It's obvious from what I've read that there's very little room for middle of the road. Sorry to say I am among those who think ""Live at the Greek"" is worthy of only 2 stars. This concert DVD should just go away. It's ruining an otherwise terrific career for Josh Groban. I've read all the excuses and they're not realistic to me nor do I care. I didn't hear the deep, rich voice that I've come to love through the years. If it's a defective DVD then there's lots of them out there. That's the best reason of all not to buy it! But I did make my own decision based on what I saw and heard. As much as I would like to do so, I can't push my rating higher. I sincerely think is isn't worth more than that."
2,I would never have believed it,Two stars? For Josh Groban? Impossible!! Or at least that's what I thought until I got mine too. His looks don't bother me at all because he's my age and I think he looks good. But he doesn't sound good (am I really saying this?). I read a few of the reviews here and it pains me to have to agree that he sounds like he has a nasal congestion sound in some of my favorite songs!! The responsible people should all be fired for this and Josh should take time off to rest his voice from the grueling concert tours. It's not my dvd player and not a bad dvd. I have many concert DVD's and none of them are a problem--they're fine. This is Josh's voice. I love Josh Groban and buy everything he does but this Greek concert is not the real Josh. It's past and I can't wait for his new CD!
1,JOSH WAS LOUSY,"THIS IS TO REVIEW THE DVD!! Or perhaps you don't know how to READ. Yes, it IS a FREE COUNTRY. You have YOUR opinions, I have MINE and THEY have THEIRS. I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT JOSH GROBAN WAS LOUSY AT THE ""GREEK"". I REALLY DON'T GIVE A HOLY CRUMB HOW GOOD HE WAS ANYWHERE ELSE BECAUSE I BLEW MY MONEY ON THIS CRUMMY DVD.SINCE IT IS A FREE COUNTRY, IT LOOKS LIKE MOST OF US CHOOSE TO GIVE THE ""GREEK"" DVD A BOTTOM LINE RATING. IF OTHERS DISAGREE, GOOD FOR THEM. IF OTHERS DON'T LIKE THE REVIEWS HERE............WELL,THAT'S JUST THEIR PROBLEM."
2,Not Very Good,"Josh Groban's second concert was not very good at all. I bought it not knowing what to expect but I knew Groban sang beautifully. I have his first concert DVD and love it. This concert is quite poor, bad, etc. Like people here, I had a hard time listening to his singing because his voice was not good. I didn't care for the entire concert really. It just wasn't what I expected."
1,Groban surprisingly Repetitive and Dull at the Greek,"Wow! What a turn of events. I loved Josh Groban in the beginning. He was shockingly talented and that voice!! What's happened to him in the few short years as a performer is even more shocking. Even with thousands of screaming fans present, with all the dazzle, Groban was just plain dull. The energy is in the audience, not in Groban's own singing or the total performance. He had a great opportunity to do a second concert that was as great as the first. This one is just an un-doing. Groban was never a true all-around entertainer. He was one powerful singer. Period. Unfortunately in this concert he is neither. It is just disappointing that he caved in to the empty-eggheads to become the male version of Mariah Carey. A good voice gone bad. Groban has become pimped by the Music Industry. It's a darned shame!"
2,Greek isn't very good,"Live at the Greek isn't good at all. There are maybe three songs on this entire DVD that are passable. But everything else that Josh Groban sings is either too nasal, too choppy in his vocal delivery or just not there. I also didn't expect Josh the Rock Singer either. It's a disappointing turn for him. Oh well, others seem to view it that way too. I'm not alone."
3,Live at the Greek is average at best,"I can understand the disappointment that many write about because I was pretty much that way too. In the first few minutes of the concert I heard the strained voice too and what sounded like a nasal sound in his voice. While this concert doesn't wow me like his first, I enjoyed ""Per Te"" and ""America."" His duet with the beautiful young violinist reminded me of what we saw in his brilliant concert in Pasadena. There are enough pro's and con's with the concert to balance out my review."
5,Josh has grow up!,"I just watch this dvd and after so many people review.. mostly i read not satisfy with this DVD.. i'm absolutely disagree.. I think Josh has a great great powerful voice and he is very good at stage. More confident and spontaneous. Please do not compare it to Josh Groban In Concert because the condition is absolutely different.I love to see josh play piano and drum and talk.. I just feel closer to him in this DVD. He is more himself. I believe some strain in his voice is particularly because of the hectic schedule but hey! it's not much.. For me its normal for a live performance! please if u wanna compare, compare it with other singer live open air performances.After all.. I LOVE LOVE this dvd sooo much.. more live and spontaneous! worth every penny i spend. I cant wait for his new album.. it's quit a long time and i already miss his voice. He is the talent that i never found from other singer!"
2,Save for the Next Groban CD,"I read somewhere that Josh Groban is now recording a new CD. With all the problems that he had during the filming of Live at the Greek, I'm saving for the new CD. This concert didn't meet my expectations and since I'm not rich, I'll wait. I love Josh and his voice is spectacular. It just wasn't in this one. The outdoors hurt his voice. I can hardly wait for his next CD!"
2,The Greek isn't Josh Groban's Best,"I don't know what's happened to Josh Groban's voice but the ""Greek"" concert is definitely not his best work. He looks and sounds poor, with the now infamous nasaly voice. Looks like the production team (or any production team for that matter), made a poor decision to tape Groban in an outdoor theatre for his second concert. While I'm sure it's a terrific keepsake for people who attended his concerts, it's obviously not impressing those of us who don't. I hope the Groban team doesn't repeat this mistake in the future. This young artist can't afford to lose any more customers."
1,josh groban at the greek,disc 2 would not play...you should ensure your products are sampled and reviewed.
2,Unfortunate Disappointment,"After a promising initial DVD concert release, this one was a step backward for Josh. His handlers need to re-evaluate their promotional efforts. This Greek concert was an embarrassment. Josh should not be portrayed as a ""rock star."" The crowd shots were too numerous and annoying. Why buy a DVD to see the crowd go insane? The Greek show itself lacked major production value. I hope this was only a ""blip"" in Josh's promising career."
2,Not Josh Groban's Fault,"I also was disappointed with how Josh sounded during the Greek concert, but I don't fault him. I think he should get a new manager and a voice coach. He should also not work so hard. Josh works very hard to sing beautifully. This concert was badly done and I think it was done without much planning by PBS.I just had to say that the voice problems Josh is having is because he's been working too hard. He really needs to stay in a studio and take his time. The next CD will be another diamond."
2,Live at the Greek on PBS,"After watching (and taping) Josh Groban's Live at the Greek concert on PBS, I didn't buy the DVD combo. As a matter of fact, I didn't watch the concert through, I just set the recorder and watched something else. The next day I tried to watch the concert through again but couldn't. Groban's voice was too nasal for me to take. Perhaps it's because I expected a Classical-Pop singer to be just that. I don't care for the loudness of it all. I did not expect a rock concert from Groban either. It absolutely was everything that you get in a rock concert but with songs in Italian?! This certainly was no tribute to Caruso. He was probably turning in his grave! If you truly love Josh Groban's singing, wait for his next studio release. If you're a diehard fan and can overlook his nasal voice and gratuitious rock staging (yes, and lots of screaming), then this is the DVD for you."
2,Poorly Done and Quite Disappointing,"I am also one of the few people who bought Josh Groban's concert DVD set. Add me to the couple of hundred people here who found the camera and sound work terrible. But the Bottom Line is Josh Groban's voice. He did not sound good at all. Josh used to have class and a terrific voice. With ""Live at the Greek"" he has neither.For a man who now has many performances under his belt and is highly paid for his work, I expect better."
1,"NO, NOPE, NADA,","I really hope that Josh Groban can look back at this as the worse thing he has ever done. I also hope that he takes notice of the lousy sales for this DVD and realizes he can't afford to repeat this bad singing. It was beyond bad. He sang from his head. Or was it his NOSE? It truly sounded like it. Since Josh is now a multi-millionaire and a pro, I won't treat him like he's a kid singing for free in a charity gig. This is the rating I think he deserves. He earned it with every minute of this miserable concert."
2,Such a Disappointment!,"I absolutely love Josh Groban. I love the depth and beauty of his voice. However, I didn't care for his ""Live at the Greek"" concert. His voice was not up to par and it truly hurt to hear it.Like other fans here, I'm a realist. I didn't like this concert but it doesn't mean that I'm giving up for good. Josh Groban has many years ahead of him to do good stuff.I read somewhere that he's now working on his next studio CD. That's good. He sounds great when he has the time to work on his singing without the noise and other foolishness that comes with an outdoor concert.I'm looking forward to his new CD. But if that's lousy, I won't buy it either. Thankfully I saw this one on TV and decided at that time it wasn't worth buying."
2,What happened to Josh Groban's VOICE?,"Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert was my first concert DVD. What an experience! I have his other CD's and love them, but in the first few minutes of this one, I was shocked by his voice. What is happening to Josh Groban?? I've read a few of the reviews and it seems like most people caught it too, the nasaly strained sound. It was terrible to hear and from someone with such a gorgeous voice. What on earth did they release this mess? It doesn't take a professional sound person to hear it, loud and clear.Well, I couldn't take it so I did return this to the store for a full refund. Then I decided to listen to Groban's first CD. Now that's how he should sound all the time!Whatever he's doing, Josh Groban should stop. That kind of strain could permanently damage his voice."
2,Awaiting the Studio Album,"The only song on this entire DVD that I enjoyed was ""America,"" and it wasn't that great. I don't think I can dump on the entire DVD or CD, but I didn't think it was worth keeping for one song so I returned it to the store. I am looking forward to Josh's next ""studio"" album where we can get new material, no background ""noise"" and his voice should be in top shape. As for concerts, I'll pass them by the the future. Josh sounds beautiful in his studio albums without all the distracting things. I adore the love songs and wish he did more. ""Closer"" had a few somewhat dark and depressing songs but ""My Confession"" was yummy! Too bad he didn't do that one at the concert!! Another mistake that should be rectified. Josh does songs like this beautifully."
2,HOPEFUL THAT JOSH CAN RECOVER,"I'm very hopeful that Josh Groban can recover from his voice problems that seem to plague him. I watched ""Live at the Greek"" during the PBS televised concert and was also shocked at the nasal sound and strain in his voice. Because of the issues, I didn't buy the DVD and it's the first time I haven't bought a Josh Groban! Warner Brothers should never have released this DVD. Or since the concert followers are so enthusiastic, they should just keep it on the tables in the concert area for them to buy. I am very hopeful and certain that Josh's next CD will be terrific because he'll have time to record when his voice is perfect. The open air and annoying, loud fans won't be a problem either. I'm looking forward to that!"
2,Josh Groban at the Greek,I was disappointed at the lack of new songs on the CD. I then watched the DVD since it listed new music not on the CD. Half way though the DVD the picture and the music began out of synk. I don't know what happened and I wonder if anyone else has noticed this problem? I was no longer able to watch the DVD it was so badly done.
2,Josh at the Greek,"I never, ever thought I'd be giving Josh Groban only two stars but here I am! I don't know what has happened to one of my favorite singers but whatever caused it I hope it isn't permanent. Josh is way too terrific to record anything with a congested sound. It was lousy to hear his voice doing that. Where's the good-looking guy? He looks as poor as he sounds. All of my favorite songs are here but what about more songs from Closer? The CD just has a few so it's not worth listening to. Did they have to film it that way? Sometimes we don't even see the stage. My favorite song of all time ""Canto Alla Vita"" was hardly recognizable! Why leave off ""My Confession???? That was a gorgeous song."
2,"""Greek"" has fallen to #88 in national record sales","I watched Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert on my PBS channel last month and I was not believing it was him! Since I'm a Pop/Rock fan and enjoyed Josh Groban's singing, I bought his first concert. I have a habit of checking Billboard.com to see how new release album sales are going. Today I checked and was not surprised to see it now at #88 in nation-wide album sales. What I've read here is reflected in poor album sales and even Amazon.com's sales rating. It's a shame because Groban is very good and I agree that this concert should never have been released with the vocal problems he was having."
1,Major Problems with Josh Groban's Greek album,"I can't believe it!! I got my order from amazon yesterday that includes 4 copies of ""Live at the Greek"" for Christmas gifts and one for me. I watched and it's terrible!!! Josh voice is very poor, strained and NASAL sounding. It's true! How could this happen? I never had to return a thing to Amazon and never had the experience of getting something so poor. Two days before Christmas I have to run out and gift lousy gift cards because this isn't going to work. No way am I giving out something even I don't want to see. It's a major disappointment because I'm a fan. This is a major issue and the reason why I'm returning them but the whole concert is pretty darned disappointing. This thing was released just before Christmas for the shopping season. I didn't see it on PBS, I just trusted that it would be terrific because Josh Groban always has been. Also, I shouldn't have to return anything because the star has voice problems!!! I'll never trust them again."
2,The Greek bears no comparison,"Yes, we have a superior Concert to compare the ""Greek"" to and it will forever haunt Josh Groban. This latest effort is not only plagued with his voice problems (nasal? congested? whatever!), it's visually sloppy too. I have both concert DVD's and the ""Greek"" bears absolutely no comparison to the first concert's lovely backgrounds, sets, and of course Josh Groban's gorgeous voice commanding the stage every minute. While I don't expect perfection, I do expect at the bare minimum, to hear a singer without a nasal twang. It just makes me shudder to hear it!"
1,Josh Groban's Concert at the Greek,"I am currently studying voice in Ontario. There are so many things every ligitimate singer has to keep in mind when performing. Josh Groban seems to have put his lessons on the side to perform and it shows. His voice strains and nasal sound are from not paying attention to the basics of voice. His badly done performance was filmed, but that's not all. People actually paid money to attend the concert too. Looks like the only one coming out ahead is Josh Groban. That may be so for now but if he keeps this up he will have no voice at all. Without the voice he has no way of selling himself because he doesn't really have a good stage presence and often looks ill at ease. Groban is not a natural in front of the camera or in front of an audience and it shows"
1,One Fan who is Sad Before Christmas,"I am a Josh Groban fan, and it is shocking and sad for me to even think I could give a low rating to anything he does. I received my copy of the ""Greek"" concert yesterday and played it immediately. From the start I heard a different voice and saw a different Josh Groban. That beautiful voice! What happened? The voice is heard in the beginning was not clear and sounded the way I do in the first stages of a head cold. It clears up later but at the cost of some of my favorite songs. Groban is a singer who sounds much better in a closed theatre or studio where he has control over the power and beauty of his voice. At the ""Greek,"" it's just not there. Although I bought this DVD and CD and am not pleased with it, I will not turn away altogether. It's just that next time I will watch it on PBS and record it first. By the way, I've bought defective DVD's in the past and this is not a defective DVD."
2,Live at the Greek now on life support,"Greak out the defibulators! (I think Amazon sells that too) Josh Groban's ""Life at the Greek"" is truly on life support. No wonder. The concert DVD is so difficult to watch. With groban's voice going back and forth between decently loud to poorly vibrating. It's on it's last legs. Just let it go to a peaceful demise and move on."
3,Not As Good As His First,"I love Josh Groban. I love his voice, I love his songs, I loved watching his first concert. In fact, as a treat after a hard day's work, I usually watch his first concert, just to enjoy the performances by Josh and his guests. It was a magnificent concert hosted by a magnificent performer.This time round however, the whole concert seemed to have taken a different path, a departure from the classy concert that was on his first DVD.I can't say I hate this second concert but it is certainly disappointing when compared to his first."
2,"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","I was out of town when the concert was shown on our PBS station, so I taped it. I watched it yesterday. I don't know what happened since the last concert, Josh has certainly changed. Unfortunately for me, the changes aren't my taste. Wasn't the first concert taped ""Live?"" Well, I actually heard Josh Groban sing in that one and I loved it. In this one the crowd is huge, loud and distracting (not the fans fault, it's just a big place). I didn't realize he became a Pop star which is strange because he sings his songs from the two CD's in Italian, Spanish. I do have the concert DVD and cd he recorded a few years ago and his first CD. Those were pretty terrific. This concert just isn't for me."
1,"Bought it before Christmas, Returned it before New Year's","I didn't see any need to watch Josh Groban's latest concert DVD more than once. I found it appallingly bad. What happened to this wonderful young man with the beautiful voice and dynamic stage presence? Looks pretty much like success has spoiled Josh Groban and he sold out to the empty-headedness that we see with lesser singers his age. I guess they thought we wouldn't notice his voice because we'd be so trilled to see a drum solo! Puhleeze! Groban didn't go platinum on his CD's and first concert DVD because of his skills as a drummer! So much is out of place here, like Josh Groban singing a tribute to the great ""Caruso,"" with the blinding light show and floating sub-titles. Caruso would turn in his grave!"
2,Many problems with this Josh Groban set,"The least of all problems that beset Josh Groban is the fact that his singing is below par. OK, it is LIVE. Yes. And singers can have a bad day. Sure. But I am paying for this concert set and it's my review so here goes.Groban's voice is...yes....noticably nasal. It's painful to hear and worse when you know that Groban is so much better. However, he does take credit as producer, et al. So perhaps it would be fair to say that we can lay some of the blame at his very feet. Since this is not a charity gig either, I can place the blame on the artist and producer.I'm not defending him either.The guy is a multi-millionaire and I'm not. So certainly I can have my say and will do so here.Bottom line. This concert set is quite poor. There are some moments where Groban is very good but not many. We DO deserve better. We're the paying fans."
2,Some good but some Very Bad,"I also wish I could write another glowing review of this latest releast by Josh Groban. I'm also very sorry that I cannot. Groban's voice is the culprit. Regardless of how I might want to hear it better, it just isn't. There are moments and a few songs that seem like Groban is getting it right, but the problems are just too overwhelming to make ""Live at the Greek"" any more than a run of the mill DVD.Like so many others here, I hope Groban takes this hiatus from concerts, to rest his voice and get back to what made him so great.Whatever his focus was on this concert simply isn't working for him."
5,Soul Stirring,"I was mesmerized from beginning to end. I loved the performance, the musicians are unbelievably talented. I have viewed the DVD repeatedly and from the first time until now it stirs my soul every time. Josh has the voice of an angel and can deliver his sound expertly."
2,Josh Groban in a bad evening,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of Josh Groban's. Having listened to all his albums and watched all his DVDs, I got disappointed about Live At The Greek. Unlike many reviewers, the flashes, lights and the rock n'roll atmosphere didn't bother me, at all. The main problem, in my opinion, was his strained and nasal voice, which messed up with a lot of beautiful songs. ""Mi Mancherai"", ""Caruso"" and ""Alla Luce del Sole"" were just unrecognizable. It seems that he was congested and couldn't sing that day, but wasn't able to postpone the performance. Luckily, I've borrowed the DVD and haven't bought it. However, I must acknowledge that he sang beautifully in some parts of the concert. ""Oceano"", ""Remember When It Rained"", ""My December"" and ""Never Let Go"" were great. The setlist was simply the best of all his concerts. Sorry he wasn't able to make it work that evening."
3,"not his best, but still good","After seeing Josh in concert a week ago, then watching this DVD again, I definitely agree with other reviewers that this was not his best work. It was still good, and I enjoyed the song selections, but he wasn't quite on his game the night they filmed this. The original live DVD from 2002 is much better."
1,Josh is better than this!,"I did buy this DvD album and I did return it. I think Josh Groban is so much better than his ""Live at the Greek"" concert. He's having many problems and it's just too hard to watch (and HEAR) this rambling mess. I also would like to see what he has in the future. But I am interested in others now and they have the voice, without attempting to pander and sell a mess like this to me."
1,Hoping to See and Hear Better from Groban,"Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" set was not even worth a second watching on PBS, very much less worth my purchasing it. His vocals were poor, the filming lousy and very amateurish. Since I was certain it would get better I did watch the PBS broadcast through to the finish. That certainly made up my mind. Buy it if you're a person who will buy anything by a singer simply because you love the performer. But don't expect the stellar Groban here. Don't even expect the Groban you used to hear. Maybe Groban's next studio album will be better. However, by the time it's released I may have moved on to the next boy wonder. I only know one thing for sure, I'll only buy CD's that are worth the money."
2,"Unfortunately, Josh ROCKS at the Greek","Yes it's true. Josh Groban takes a Rock-style turn at the Greek and it can't diminish the fact that his beautiful voice is poor during one-third of the concert. All the flash and dazzle can't mask that fact as many have noted here. Groban needs to re-think his strategy before ever releasing another ""Live"" concert with so many vocal problems from its singular performer."
1,Give it a Listen BEFORE you Buy,"It won't hurt to check it out before you buy. Actually if you listen beforehand, you won't regret your purchase the way I did. While I love Groban's past recordings, the Greek concert did less than thrill me. Every good record store will play a sample for you if you ask. Don't go by these reviews telling you what to do, everyone has his or her own opinion. It's your money."
2,The Best and Worst of Josh Groban,"With Josh Groban's first CD and Concert DVD I saw the absolute best....absolute perfection. When you listen to Josh and Charlotte Church performing ""The Prayer,"" it's hard to imagine anything more beautiful. His performance of ""Alejate,"" ""Canto Alla Vita"" and ""To Where You Are,"" in the Pasadena Concert DVD is perfection. So now we have Live at the Greek to compare them to because he sings, or attempts to, all three on this Concert DVD too. When you have a comparator, well you know this is poor. Until now, Josh Groban had beautiful music out for us to buy. In my case, I bought many copies for gifts. Now we have this poor relation. Listen to his voice on any previous recordings, then compare it to the strained voice you hear on this one and the vocal issues are evident. I did buy the Concert DVD and I am regretting it. There's simply no comparison to the sheer beauty of Josh Groban's voice, prior to ""Live at the Greek."""
1,This CAN'T be Josh Groban!!,"That's what I said in the first half hour of the concert at the Greek. What a difference he has made in his looks and the way he sings. I just wish I liked it, but I didn't. I hope Josh's best work isn't behind him and I'm praying that it isn't. I loved all past performances and his voice was just so beautiful, with the orchestra and guests. He does have one guest violinist in this concert and she is terrific. But Josh Groban is much less. I read that the concert was filmed and recorded over two days. Didn't anyone catch the nasal tone in his songs???? Sloppy and a major disappointment that the people in charge (Josh Groban takes ""Producer"" credits), kept those songs in. It's just a major disappointment overall."
1,I hate Josh Groban,"The people giving Josh high marks are seriously disturbed or haven't heard enough Josh (their loss!!!). I just went to his concert last night and he was dreadful. Here's an artist with loads of talent and a dull personality. My chipmonk sounds 100 times better in person than on CD/or TV, if that even sounds possible. He put so little emotion and feeling into every song (it felt like he was only singing to my mom). There are not enough words to describe how lousy the performance was. I love classical music, but this isn't even close. Do yourself a favor and do what millions of others are doing...leave it on the racks. (better yet pass up all of them) and I guarantee that you'll be happy you did."
2,An Unexpected Performance by Groban,"I bought my CD/DVD set of ""Live at the Greek"" two months ago and decided to wait before making up my mind. There were so many negative reviews here that I didn't want to add to them without being fair. Well, two months is a fair trial. I actually found it very poor the first time I saw the DVD. The CD is the same but without the lovely face of Lucia Micarelli. That's really bad because she was the brightest star in this concert. Josh Groban's voice was what I bought the concert for and it is why I also rated the concert so low. To do otherwise is to overlook the obvious problems with his performance.By the way, Amazon needs to have ""spell check"" for some of the fans. It would make their reviews readable."
1,Returned my Greek DVD today,"This review saddens me to no end. I was so excited to see Josh Groban had a new concert DVD out, that I ""Pre-Ordered"" this one and paid full price. My mistake. The concert performance is so shockingly bad that I was speechless. Lucia Micarelli performed beautifully, though and I see a bright future ahead of her. Her solo was tremendous and a highlight of the concert. I don't know what's happening to Groban but his voice was not in control and there was so much warbling and nasal sound I couldn't believe it. Regardless of why it was so, it's not MY fault nor is it MY problem. I still love my first concert DVD and hope Groban can take control of his voice before any other recordings are made."
1,"Yes Folks, This is the REAL Josh Groban","After I got my ""Live at the Greek"" DVD and CD I watched and remained in a state of denial, telling myself ""This is NOT the Josh Groban I knew."" Well, after reading back to some of the 5-star reviews from concert-attending fans, I've got the confirmation that Groban REALLY is like that in all of his concerts. Now that I know, I'm no longer making the effort to watch this DVD, denying that he can't be that bad. In fact, he is that bad. His beautiful voice is weak and nasal as he tries to regain the power he once had in prior recordings. Since I am not deaf, and I can hear all the flubbed notes, I'll add my ""Greek"" DVD to those at my local music store. If anyone hasn't bought it yet and is contemplating a purchase, I suggest getting one cheaply from a re-sale shop. There'll be lots of 'em for you to buy!"
2,"Wish I could recommend the ""Greek""","But after watching it for the zillionth time, I just can't honestly recommend that others buy Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek."" I bought it and before doing this review I wanted to be as focused as I could. Josh Groban has voice problems and it plays out on the DVD and the CD. In addition, there are skewed camera angles which look very amateurish and some poor sound quality. If Josh had done more of his newer songs from ""Closer"" this concert DVD would have a more new feel, but that didn't happen. It's much like watching the first concert but with so many problems that it's hard to watch."
2,That's not my JOSH,"I love Josh Groban's voice. And the voice on the Live at the Greek DVD is not the Josh I know. He sounds terribly strained. He must be exhausted having the very heavy schedule he's had over the past year, and believe me, it's taking a toll on that heavenly voice. I wince with every nasally note and forced vibrado during this performance. Real Josh fans know what I'm talking about. Having seen him perform live three times in the past year, I will say this: He sounds better live indoors than in amphitheaters (like the Greek theater). Don't waste your money on this DVD. Instead, buy Josh Groban in Concert, his first DVD release, if you want to hear perfection. And remember, the first DVD was recorded when he was only 20! WOW!"
2,Shocking Performance at the Greek,"I can't believe that I'm even writing this, but from the looks of it I'm not the only one who is very disappointed with my concert DVD by Josh Groban. I was stunned to hear his voice, once so beautiful now strained and warbling, even nasal. This is not the voice that I heard in ""Josh Groban in Concert,"" his first concert DVD and CD for PBS. The man now sounds and looks bad. Gee, did they think we wouldn't notice?!? To even release this for sale is an insult and it seems to be hurting Groban's reputation also. Even without the voice problems, I do have concerns that he's selling out by commercialization, meaning an assumption that we're all empty-headed doofus's. I can hear and see perfectly and what is on the Greek is truly nothing I want to see more than once. It sad because I finally found someone who would SING, who sounded beautiful on CD and I could listen to without having to buy CD's of long-dead singers. Well, no longer."
1,"FORTUNATELY, I CAN HEAR!!","That is why I gave Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" ONE star and so have many many more reviewers here. It doesn't deserve more than this. The overwhelming number of reviews are from people who can HEAR pretty darned good and have bought this terrible DVD set, to major disappointment. We can HEAR every NASAL note that Groban belts out. I'm not alone but apparently some people are in limbo because all the insults in the world can't make people go deaf to the problems Groban is having. I'M HAPPY I GOT MY REFUND. THIS DVD SET IS HARDLY DESERVING OF ONE STAR."
2,"I passed up the ""Greek"" concert DVD","I watched the ""Live at the Greek"" concert on my PBS channel in December and noticed Josh Groban's voice problems early in the program. That was the televised program and I heard it, so I was certain that it would play out on the DVD and CD. As I can see from the reviews, it was very bad. Perhaps his next studio album will be better. For Groban's sake I hope it is so because people have an unforgiving nature when it comes to poor performances. No singer can afford to disappoint more than once. Since Groban isn't a singer who appeals across the board, I hope he does improve."
2,Josh Groban's Greek Concert,"The second concert by Josh Groban, ""Live at the Greek"" is not what one would expect from the terrific young Pop singer. Most importantly, his voice is very poor, noticably nasaly, in the first few minutes of the concert. The Greek is an outdoor theatre with hundreds of screaming, loud fans waving glowsticks and being annoyingly louder than necessary. Of course that shouldn't be a problem if the performer is so wonderful you don't care. But he isn't and I do. Groban's concert was supposed to be based on his latest CD ""Closer,"" but don't be fooled by the promo's. What he really does is repeat many songs previously recorded on his first concert DVD. Unfortunately for Groban those performances were beautifully recorded and his voice was simply perfect. Not so with the repeat performances at the Greek. With only a handful of songs from ""Closer,"" and poorly done songs from previously recorded CD's, the Greek concert DVD can't do anything for me but leave me disappointed indeed."
3,Losing Charm?,"I am a Josh Groban fan and was successful in convincing my sister and her 10 year-old and 5 year old sons to like the music. I have all his CD's and DVD's; I also watched his concert at the Concord Pavillion. I saw the PBS broadcast of the concert and I agree with many of the reviewers here that the show did not have the magnetism and the enthusiasm seen in his first DVD, in short, a disappointment. Perhaps I have seen and heard him more than enough but I still like his music and will wait for more new releases. Maybe what he can do is to change his concert format and dress up nicely. His songs and his clothes do not match."
3,"""Live at the Greek"" Not Groban's Best Work","I haven't kept up with Josh's career, although I bought all the DVD's and CD's. I watched my ""Live at the Greek"" DVD the firt time this month and was heartily shocked and disappointed at what's happened to Josh. I'm sure there are many reasons why he looks and sounds so poorly but I also acknowledge that he does. The fans deserve better and that goes specially for the ones who bought the DVD set. To film Josh doing remakes of his own songs which were so lovely in the first concert was also a big mistake. They're so poorly done here. Fans come and go, especially with young and ""unformed"" singers like Groban who are still finding their way. Perhaps he'll look at the reviews, tanking album sales, and realize that his concert personna doesn't translate that great over to the recorded DVD."
1,"Returned ""Greek"" Twice, Silly me","I can't believe I bought Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" TWICE. The first time I heard Groban's nasal voice I came here to see early postings that the DVD was ""defective."" I was enthusiastic, so I went back to the store to exchange it for another. Can you guess what happened?? Yes, Groban was again nasaly. Same songs too. That was in early December. Now that I see so many others noticed the nasaly voice I just gave up. Too bad it really is Josh Groban sounding that way. I made two efforts to hold on but I won't anymore. I paid for it TWICE. I won't ever again."
2,Poor Performance by Josh Groban??,"For me this is very painful because I loved Josh Groban's voice. He's been out of the public eye due to his concert tour, for the past two years but the changes are startling! He was so beautifully in charge of his voice and, well, he was gorgeous too. I didn't see any of the Josh Groban I loved during the Greek concert. His voice is very very poor, constrained, warbling in the beginning. Anyone will tell you that if you begin poorly it's hard to get the audience back. I read that this DVD was recorded over two nights. If Groban's voice was better any time I think they would have picked something else. Problem was they didn't so the vocals probably weren't any better. Too bad for Josh Groban. I don't know if I'll get his next CD but I do know that I'll be careful and listen before I do."
2,Lessons Learned,"When I saw that Josh Groban had a new Concert recording DVD and CD set out, I rushed to order it. I received it last week and have watched it twice. I'm not sure what happened, it doesn't even look like the Josh Groban I've seen in previous televised appearances and definitely doesn't look or sound like the previous Concert, his first. He looks and sounds strained. Exhausted even. That's really not the only problem I have with the Concert. I simply did not enjoy it. Looks like he decided to change the way he sings and his personal appearance is sloppy. Standing next to the gorgeous violinist he looked like a bum. Thinking back on it now, I wish that I hadn't rushed out to pay full price for this DVD set. I've learned a good lesson. It won't happen again. For future concerts, and that goes with any singer, I'll find out what it is before I buy it. I just feel that this is a poor follow up to an otherwise excellent first PBS Concert."
1,Live at the Greek on PBS LAST NIGHT!!,"Was THAT really Josh Groban?? His PBS special concert was on last night (March 5th) and I couldn't believe that was Josh Groban! I don't think PBS is believing it either. His voice was really bad from the beginning. I bought ""Closer"" along with all Groban's other music, but this concert was nothing like Josh Groban. His voice was terrible and I caught the nasaly sound too. All the long camera angles were fine with me but the close-ups of women screaming (we're talking in their 40's) were just too much for me. I would never make such an idiot out of myself for someone young enough to be my kid! This was like a Ringling circus and I did see a few elephants too. I hope Josh Groban really, really takes stock of what he's become and goes back to what he was.....with the great voice and without the idiotic things I saw at the Greek."
2,Very Confused by Josh Groban's Greek,"Early in Josh Groban's career there was lots of chatter about whether he was a pop or classical singer. What I enjoyed regardless of the category was his voice and appearance. Apparently I wasn't alone because his CD's and first concert were runaway hits. Now we have the Greek concert that infuses even more confusing and astonishing elements. There are rock-style sets and lights, synthicized keyboards and drum solos. There are Pop songs and Classical songs (in Italian). And we mustn't forget the filming of hundreds in the outdoor ""Greek"", screaming, waving and twirling light sticks. Just the fact that all these things are included in a concert are confusing enough, but even more confusing is Josh Groban. His voice is good, poor, great, poor again, nasal, great, strained. By the end of the concert I was exhausted trying to figure it all out."
2,Josh Groban's Greek Concert,"By the looks of most reviews here, I am in the majority. I decided not to buy the concert DVD set after I watched it on TV. I did buy his first concert because I truly enjoyed it. No so for the Greek one. It wasn't even good enough to watch through. Whatever Groban has been doing for the past two years since his last live concert, it's been harming his voice. Too bad also that he's giving in to pressure from the talking heads to dumb-down his appearance and his performance style. People are just plain tired of the empty-headed Britney Spears/Justin Timberlakes of the world. Josh Groban didn't give into that until now. He had more talent when he was a teenager than he does now. Too bad."
4,Give the kid a break,"I thoroughally enjoyed watching the PBS broadcast, and knew I wanted this CD/DVD. Some of the other reviewers commented on the poor sound quality of the DVD--I did not experience this at all. In response to all the comments about the flashiness of the concert, too many shots of the audience, Josh over exerting his voice by talking too much at the expense of his singing, etc---I think people should keep in mind that this was a recording of a live show. Part of live music is all the unexpected things, (colds and congestion) the little quirks, most importantly the interaction with the audience. All of those things make live music the incredible experience that it is. And Josh is 23, a young man who ought to be having fun with his interactions with his audience. I admired and enjoyed his enthusiastic stage presence. I am very satified with my purchase. The only reason I'd give it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I was expecting to have more songs that I could listen to on the CD."
2,"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","I was impressed with all Groban's singing until the release of ""Josh Groban, Live at the Greek."" His voice is truly strained, and his performance is less than what I would expect for any professional. Like it or not, Groban is a professional singer, not a kid anymore. He has to earn my money. This was one real cheesy concert with equally cheesy vocals from Groban. The ray of light was Lucia Micarelli who gave a stunning performance. However, I didn't find this enough to make the set worth buying. More releases like this will bring Groban to the level of a ""has been"" pronto."
4,Excellent performance,"This was an amazing concert. But I don't think the remake of America by Paul Simon fits his style of voice. I usually don't like when he tries the pop thing. And the one other thing that really dissapointed me was that he didn't do my two favorite songs. They are ""when you say you love me"", and ""Broken vow"". If he had done them, it would have been a perfect concert. I hope Josh Groban is reading this, so he might sing them in February when I see him at Madison Square Garden in NY. This CD was two songs away from 5 stars for me."
4,*** Technical problems? email WARNER BROS.,"...OK, so I haven't watched my dvd yet, but saw it locally on PBS and it truely was a ""Great Performance""...nothing ""off"" about the broadcast. But the cd I received has bad sound quality in several songs. Not sure what the problem is, but WARNER has asked that anyone with what they think is a bad copy email them...I'm off to watch my dvd now - be back later...Here is their posting:--------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for all your support of Josh's new DVD/CD ""Live at the Greek""We've seen a few postings stating that people have had technical problems with the discs.Would anyone who has had any difficulty please send an email to liveatthegreek@warnerreprise.com, and please be specific as to what the problem is, and where you purchased the DVD/CD?It would be very helpful. We will get back to you quickly with a response.Thank You,Your friends at Reprise Records"
1,What happened?,"Remember that magical night when Josh Groban sang in Pasadena California on PBS? That was one of the most gorgeous concerts on earth! Look at this new DVD! It only reveals a shadow of Josh's glorious voice! And I am surprised too to see some reviews which look more or less written by blinded grobanites who cannot accept the fact that their Josh has lost some of that beauty which made him ""the Josh."" This new DVD isn't good at all. His voice has deteriorated, the theatre setting is inappropriate for the projection of his voice, and the crowd just seems so demented. It's a fiasco! This only receives good reviews because of his fans. If you would compare his wonderful performances in the past with this one, it would be like comparing really good Champagne with cheap beer. Ugh!"
2,"Nasaly Voice is a Major Issue with ""Live at the Greek""","In the first few minutes of Josh Groban's Greek concert I heard the nasaly voice that so many reviewers have commented on here. Although it clears up later it's just so evidently a problem and ruins an otherwise average concert. Groban's talent lies squarely with his voice, not his piano or drum playing. That's pretty mediocre too. His personality is stilted and uncomfortable to watch because he's no naturally at ease. Groban looks, sounds and is better in a closed theatre environment where he can gain control over his voice and there's less audience noise for him to sing over."
1,Josh is wonderful in concerts,"I think Josh Groban is a wonderful singer. This is not what his voice sounds like in his concerts and he should fire whoever made this DVD. Also get David Foster back, Josh and David make terrific music together."
1,Who is Jose Grobano?? (LOL),"I just read the last reviews and I'm puzzled. One fan wrote a rave review about JOSE GROBANO. Who is ""Jose Grobano?"" Oh well, at least I know who I'm writing about. JOSH GROBAN, ""Live at the Greek,"" and we do know it was LIVE because the title of the concert is LIVE at the Greek. However any resemblance to liveliness rests solely with the audience and the choir. Groban seems to have left his voice behind and instead we get a croaky nasaly songster who can barely make it through the first few sets. I watched it also and decided then and there not to buy this one."
2,"""Live at the Greek"" was a surprise!","I wish I could say it was a happy surprise but the Greek wasn't. Perhaps the best part was when Groban sang ""Per Te,"" which was from his newest album, ""Closer."" I agree that there should be no acceptable excuse to keep in the vocals where Groban sounds poor, when a bit of editing would have kept the better versions. But then we also have poorly done remakes of many songs (I counted 5) from ""Josh Groban in Concert."" Groban handles ""Believe"" nicely, but I think there could have been something better than ""America."" The sound and camera work were miserable. I hope Groban's next work is as good as what he's released in the past. The Greek isn't anywhere close."
3,"Live at the Greek, Ups and Downs","Okay, I confess that I didn't buy the DVD and CD! Since I'm not out of $30 (I taped the PBS showing), I can be kind. There are many good and some bad things about the Greek concert, all of which I'm seen on this site. The good to great was seeing Josh Groban perform and hear his voice. The bad is also his voice. Yeah, it comes and goes. I'm happy I have a tape of the concert. I'm equally happy I watched it first and was content with my VCR copy. I believe Josh has many more brilliant and beautiful CD's and concerts ahead of him. Hopefully, there won't be any repeats of the problems we see at the Greek Theatre."
1,"Does Josh have a new vocal coach? If not, he needs one!","I am a huge fan of Josh Groban's voice so I was extremely disappointed to hear Live at the Greek. His usually rich, wonderful voice sounds so nasally (particularly in the first few numbers) that listening to it is almost painful! After the success of his outstanding first live CD/DVD, Josh has made a noteworthy attempt to do something different with the style of this concert but it appears to be at the expense of his voice. I realize that live recordings usually sound different from studio recordings, and appreciate that an outdoor venue and a long concert tour would have had some impact on his voice, but the bottom line is that, for the most part, Josh sounds terrible and I am simply amazed that Live at the Greek was released to the public! Hopefully, his next recording will be back to the high standard of his first three CDs, which were simply beautiful."
1,LOUSY JOB JOSH!!!!,"YIKES!! What is it?? Lousy vocals and a disappointing second concert. This was a ""Closer"" Tour?? Could of fooled me since he only does a handful of the songs from ""Closer."" The rest are poorly done repeats from ""Josh Groban in Concert"" (his first concert DVD). That one was superior!! This one is LOUSY!! The miserable DVD sales bear that out!!"
1,Josh Groban's Live at the Greek,"I saw Josh Groban's Live at the Greek concert on Public Television a few days ago. Of course it was during one of their endless pledge drives.NOW I know what everyone is complaining about! I wouldn't have believed it but Josh looks terrible and sounds worse. Everything about him is different including the way he sings. This whole concert was nuts with all those screaming middle-aged women making fools of themselves and making the concert even more awful. At one point the camera shows us TWO flabby women jumping up and down and screaming like teens watching Justin Timberlake. Ewwweeeee. Puhleeze make it stop.Okay, back to Josh. His voice was bad. Really bad. Sounded kinda froggy. Why on earth did he re-do ""Canto Alla Vita? It was awful. Instead of adding the hot My Confession from Closer, he did To Where You Are. Another puhleeze, make it stop!Like that energizer bunny, it kept going and going. Josh sounded worse and worse. Too bad."
2,This concert saddens and disappoints,I don't know what happened to Josh Groban since the last concert but it's evident that he hasn't had an easy time of it. His beautiful voice is so strained that it makes me sad to hear it. I think I'm luckier than the folks who bought it because I watched the concert on PBS. That's when I decided not to buy this one. I hope that Josh resolves his problems before the next CD. This does not represent the greatness that we've heard in the past.
1,All I could do was CRINGE,"I watched Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert when it was shown on PBS this past December and all I could do was cringe. He hit so many sour notes it wasn't funny. I thought he was a good singer a few years ago and kind of cute but now he just looks bad and sings worse. It's amazing that this concert was recorded over two nights and they couldn't get a good version of many songs without Groban's voice sounding so bad. I guess they think the poor fools will buy anything any time. Well from what I can see they severely misjudged the audience beyond those who attend the live concerts. Without the mass hysteria to carry you away as what usually happens when you're part of the big audience, it's just a poor concert. Definitely not worth the money. I'm sure with Josh Groban's so-called perfectionism, he must want this concert DVD to go away too. It's a career killer."
1,Couldn't bear to hear it!,"I kept cringing as I heard Josh Groban's voice strain and go nasal in the first few minutes of the Greek concert DVD so I decided to send it to our re'sale shop. I couldn't get a refund because our local store doesn't take used DVD's back. I didn't attempt to use the ""Defective DVD"" excuse because the DVD worked fine. Unfortunately Josh Groban didn't."
2,The NEW Josh Groban,"I watched Josh Groban's concert on TV and was very very disappointed with his new look and sound. This definitely isn't the super guy with the gorgeous voice that I fell in love with. Everything about him is different. Maybe I've just grown past him (I'm 23 just like Josh), or maybe he decided to grow up and do his own thing. Oh well, it happens. Anyway, I won't be getting this concert as a Christmas present, definitely."
2,"Not glowingly impressed, but Hopeful for the Future","I bought the DVD/CD and watched the concert on PBS and this concert is definitely different. My sister loyally recorded every appearance and she even has Josh singing ""Love Affair to Remember,"" on PBS when they did great movie songs. (someday I'll get a copy). But, Try as I want to, I just don't think this is the best thing Josh Groban has done so far. His voice is definitely strained and this concert is filmed in a theatre that is too big and open for a good recording. If you haven't bought the first concert DVD/CD set yet, please give that one a try! The sound and sight of it is absolutely breathtaking. This new concert could have been filmed and recorded better. Unfortunately it wasn't. Josh Groban is a terrific, talented man, so this won't make him old news."
2,Ooooh. This is painful,"Those were my words exactly when I heard the first few minutes of Josh's ""Greek"" concert. I was in denial at first that his voice could actually sound so bad, it there it was. I taped the concert from the PBS showing and watched it later when I was more rested (I thought it was me). Sadly it wasn't my hearing, it was Josh Groban's actual voice. After reading all these reviews I know it wasn't just me either! I kept up with Josh's music in the past but didn't see much of him while he was doing concerts. Good grief has he CHANGED!! His voice is bad but he even looks bad too. All the screaming in the background, camera views of foolish women.....YUK."
2,Josh Groban doesn't shine at the Greek,"I bought Josh Groban's Live at the Greek DVD set for my wife and we watched it before Christmas. Like so many others here, we were quite shocked by his voice problems. We were equally shocked by his radically changed performance style. It captures elements of Pop, Rock, Classical and something else I can't exactly define. All of this is background for classical styled vocals? No wonder so many fans are confused. We were also. We were also disappointed that Groban has performed older songs in such a different way as to be unrecognizable. ""Canto Alla Vita"" is the worst, beginning with a eardrum-popping keyboard solo and ending with yet another eardrum-popping drum solo by Groban. While the crowd seemed to be taking all this in with enthusiastic madness, those of sitting at home were just staring at each other in shock. Poorly sung and badly done."
2,A BIG letdown,"I'm a big fan and love everything about Josh Groban. I watched the concert on out local PBS station and I'm very disappointed. As luck would have it, I received my copy of the DVD and CD the day of the concert. I was already disappointed by the concert, and even more so by both the DVD and CD. But it just wasn't the DVD or CD sound, it was the actual CONCERT. Josh is overwhelmed by the crowd and we hardly see him with some views. Nothing in this concert even comes close to the quality of the other recordings! Whatever the problem is, I'm very very sad for it. I'm just one person (who bought multiple copies of every CD and the previous concert DVD and CD), but it seems like I'm not alone from the sound of other comments here."
1,Josh Groban's Greek Concert---Major Disappointment,"Hmmm. Seems that the 5-star reviews start by insulting people who can actually HEAR. Yes, and they also come from people who are concert followers. So THEY were among the SCREAMING females in the audience (who were so busy screaming they didn't hear Groban's actual singing). I put earplugs in my ears because I could HEAR Josh Groban's strained, poor vocals. Since I don't have stars in my eyes either, I can honestly state that this is the worst thing Josh Groban has done. Hopefully it will be the last or he'll be good for nothing else but warbling in front of tone-deaf females."
2,Where is Josh's Golden Voice?!?,What happened to Josh and his beautiful voice???? I waited two years to get another concert from Josh but this one is so bad I wanted to cry. I can't bear to hear the CD because I hear it on the CD too. omg this is so disapointing and I can't believe I would ever be disappointed with anything Josh did. This was supposed to be my best Christmas gift but it's not. I can't return it so I'll send it off to our used music store. I hope that Josh gets his voice back soon. His voice is too beautiful to waste on this. I'm only 17 but I know what I like and I love Josh Groban!!!! (I just don't like the Greek)
2,Not as good as the frist Dvd,I did not like this dvd that much I thought he was trying too much to be a rock star and some of the stuff he just does not sound that good. Some of the songs are done good but there are others where thing do not sound that good.
3,"Could be better, but not too bad","I'm a little disappointed with the Live at The Greek CD/DVD. I've heard Josh sing much better (try the first DVD, Josh Groban in Concert), and the screaming teenagers were highly distracting. But it has its good points. The show was energetic, but not frantic, in its pace. The back up musicians are awesome, and Josh's drum solo was cool. His cover of Paul Simon's America was a highlight of the show. As the evening went on, Josh got into the groove better, so the later songs sound better than the earlier ones.If you want to hear the music at its best, this probably isn't something you want to buy. The main downfall of this CD/DVD is that it was a live performance recorded for TV without the control of an indoor concert hall or recording studio. A fun show, but definitely not Groban's best."
3,An okay Concert by Josh Groban,"Perhaps I can give Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert three stars because I didn't buy the DVD. I saw it as the PBS special on tv and recorded it on tape. This is the first recording by Groban that I did not buy, mainly because I thought it was ""okay."" Not good enough to buy though. I guess you have to be a die-hard fan to buy it. I'm not. I just enjoy his singing. Perhaps his next CD will be better. After hearing the affected voice at the Greek, I sincerely hope so."
4,Josh is Premo,Not being a Opera follower but I just love his voice...Josh can only add to his following by continued expansion of his ballets
4,disappointing,I found this to be a little disappointing as I felt Josh's voice seemed to be a little weaker than usual.
1,"Josh Groban, ""Live at the Greek""","I received this DVD set for mother's day. My daughter and I are both fans. Although we loved everything he has recorded before, this concert isn't worth watching. Josh Groban's voice was very nasal, and very different in many selections. His new style just doesn't suit him. I'm not a granny either, I'm a young mom. I'm sure he will continue to have fans that enjoy this type of singing and music. I just found it very unappealing."
1,What a Bummer,"I am a fan of Josh Groban and welcome him to the music world, it's about time we get a artist that can actually sing and not RAP (I don't consider ""rap"" music). I don't understand why he would release this CD with repeated music from his first concert CD. This CD was released before Christmas, I think a Christmas CD would of been a better choice for him.I am hoping he was suffering from a cold during this concert, because this would explain why he sang through his nose!The music industry wonders why sales are down, well then STOP trying to push the ""RAP CRAP"" at us and show us some good talent like Josh. Each year it gets harder and harder to watch any music award show due to the lack of real tallent out there."
2,Groban's latest below Par,"Below Par in the music biz for me nowadays means that I won't spend my money on it. I'm only thankful that PBS aired this concert (many, many, many times). I only saw it once and was hardly able to bear it then. Groban was star-worthy as a kid. As an adult he's just whiney and annoying. I'm glad I didn't go with the hype and watched for myself. In my opinion, It's truly a bad bit of business."
2,Not Josh Groban's Best Work,"I hope this isn't a glimpse of things to come from Josh Groban. I hope he hasn't decided to be a rock star and leave his style and class behind him. I hope so, but I'm afraid it is happening because it happened at the Greek theatre. Eveything that Josh Groban was (a terrific singer, with style and class), he is not during this concert. Since it isn't just one concert but his entire year or more of concert tours, this is what he's doing. I'm sorry to learn it and the hard way. I spent my money on something that is entirely disappointing. The new and different Josh Groban is not a new and improved Groban. He's just very nasal and very silly looking."
2,This concert needs direction!,"It also needs style, taste, better sets, and OH YEAH.....Josh Groban's voice needs improvement."
3,"Dissapointed, so I sold my copy","I bought this DVD/CD the first day it came out and was filled with excitement and great anticipation. I have been a Josh Groban fan for awhile and thought that his first concert DVD was brilliant. His vocal techniques were flawess, the tones were always warm, rich and pitch perfect. This latest release however, finds his voice strained, annoyingly nasal at times and even flat.This is not a defect in the dvd's audio, as some reviewer's have stated. It's sad but true the ""voice"" is not there. Perhaps the continous touring have put hopefully only a temporary strain on his once magnificent voice.I refuse to watch this concert DVD again, so a few days later I sold my copy to a used CD store. I got back only a fraction of what I paid for but it would have never seen the light of day again. His record label should have put this product on hold until a better live performance was recorded."
1,"Josh Groban, ""Live at the Greek""","I'm very confused as to how they made and released this DVD set. There are so many flaws in Josh Groban's singing, and yes, I can clearly hear the problems with his voice. I don't really care why he sounds so bad, I do care that I wasted my money on this really bad sounding concert. The fans deserve better.From the getgo, I heard Groban singing with a warble and then he graduated to very nasal. Gee, I don't have to be a vocal genius to tell this is a problem.I think Josh Groban has many great performances in his future. Unfortunately, this wasn't one of them.If you haven't bought this one yet, take caution. Listen first. Hey! If you love it, then you haven't wasted your bucks."
2,Hoping that the next will be better,"I also have all of Josh Groban's CD's and his first concert DVD. I didn't buy ""Live at the Greek"" mainly because his voice was very bad. He was very nasal and I simply didn't care for the concert. His guests were terrific especially Ms Micarelli. However, Josh Groban himself was not the greatest. Hopefully he'll do much better with the next CD release. He just needs to keep in mind that young talented male singers are crooning out songs every day, so there is some competition."
2,"Bought the first, but passed on the Greek","I bought Josh Groban's first concert DVD set two years ago after seeing it on TV and have loved it ever since. I too have all of his CD's, including his latest ""Closer."" So I was all prepped to love ""Live at the Greek"" with as much gusto. I'm sorry to say that the concert wasn't interesting for me at all. I think that Josh's voice problems were just too much for me to handle. With such a tremendous voice, Josh should really protect it. Outdoor concerts may sound great to those who are there (and busy screaming) but it doesn't work for Josh Groban on a DVD. I also was disappointed that he repeated so many of the selections from the first concert and they weren't done very well this time. He actually does have newer material! Anyway this concert was not worth my buying. So I didn't buy it. No regrets."
2,Groban's Live at the Greek,PBS is now having a Spring Pledge Week and I watched Josh Groban's concert last night. omg....he sounded awful most of the time. I liked the singing at the end but this was after almost the entire concert. I was also sad that he didn't include more of his recent songs instead of the older ones. Enough said.
2,My Valentine's Day Disappointment,"I got ""Live at the Greek"" for this recent Valentine's Day and found it (the Greek, not my Valentine) a big disappointment. I don't know if anyone got the Greek concert recently but this was my experience. I only found this site while looking for a CD for my mom. I didn't know there was a place for people to post reviews! Well, I'm here now and it looks like many people had the same experience. Josh doesn't look or sound the same. I didn't like his singing at the Greek and definitely didn't like his newer versions of Canto Alla Vita and Alejate. Why mess with success? Okay, they did and what I got with ""Greek"" is a mess. I'm glad they have these sites. If there is a next time (not sure at this time), I will wait and sample the music first. No harm, no foul. No disappointment either."
2,This isn't the same Josh Groban,"All I can say is ""Buyer Beware."" If you buy this DVD thinking you'll see the same Josh Groban that made you love him in recent recordings, you'll be shocked. He looks and sounds quite different. The voice that was so astounding, strong and mature is remarkedly weak here. The only reason why I gave two stars is because his voice is good in ""Caruso"" and ""You Raise me Up."""
2,Totally Agree!,"After watching Josh Groban's concert on PBS recently, I have to agree that this one was not at the level of quality I've come to expect. It wasn't even close. Groban's voice was very congested and it was annoying to hear. Not all the music was bad, but enough of it was to make up my mind not to buy it."
2,What happened to the rest of it?!?!,"I saw the special in PBS and was very much waiting to be able to get the show in DVD. I was surprised to see how nasal and strained JG sounded at the beggining of the show. All in all I was happy to see him him perform as he is one of my favorites when it comes to vocals.However, what happened to the rest of the show? THe first CD has only 6 tracks out of the entire concert and the DVD is missing a lot of the show as well.I trully expected the entire show to be included in the dvd and the audio, espcially being the closing of a tour."
1,Not MY Problem,"I boughtJosh Groban's""Live at the Greek""and paidmy money for it.No matter who messed up hereor made the decisionsto do itI really should nothave to payfor this messBUTI didWarner Bros,Reprise RecordsandJosh Groban himselfdid nothingto give me mymoney back.TheyIn turnhave lost nothingSo.I've learned a valuable lessonI will no longerbuy anything from Josh Groban"
2,Not Formatted Like a Script,Just got the Kindle edition and am disappointed that this is not formatted like a script and does not contain scene numbers.
5,Awesome!,"I have been a fan of this movie for years and have seen it well over 500 times. Although I found three minor erros in the transcript while I read the book, It was still great."
5,Copyright,"The compiler of this series always makes great efforts to track down the copyright holders. Rather than leave off tracks for which he can't find the holder they are included in the ""interests of art and music history"". The text with the CD explains this, and invites that untraceable copyright holders make contact to fix any problems (or take legal action)Please bear this in mind when considering buying this CD"
1,Blatant Inaccuracies in These Listings,"My review is based on excerpts that appeared in the newspaper. I am a florist who employs 10 people; we have worked and networked with many florists, and can say conclusively that the rating of ""florist"" as the 5th least stressful job is totally unbelievable. Although this information reportedly comes from telephone surveys, there is NO WAY anyone spoke to a real florist to arrive at this conclusion! All of us have worked a variety of jobs, none more stressful than floristry. I won't go into the many reasons why this is so; my point is, this rating is so far from realistic that I have zero confidence in these ratings."
4,good price,"Most kits like this have 2 oz. jars of paint. These jars are 16 ozs. and worth $40.00 for just the paint. But you also get the brushes and cups, one brush for each color, so you don't have the paint mixing on one brush, problem. As much. Also, this paint is thick enough to add water and still get a good color. And you can wash it out. Just don't eat it."
4,great set!,"My three year old loves the chunky paint brushes, I love that it's not near as messy for him to paint as it could be. The white paint is really thin, but over all the set is wonderful."
5,Soups,"This small soup recipe book holds some of the very best soup recipes I have come across in 45 years of cooking. All of them I would rate as a B to A++. For those just starting into the joy of cooking, it has in the first pages excellent methods of creating your own stocks (chicken, beef, fowl, fish). The recipes are simple, yet have a wholesome family taste - none are overboard on taste; hence, the kids will enjoy."
1,Painful!,"Ken Russell is a gifted director, as his erratic career has proved, but even the great Vanessa Redgrave can't save this one. ""The Devils,"" a gaudy, loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism, went painfully awry. Grisly images of plague victims, quack cures, peculiar enemas, and Oliver Reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail--unfortunately, they are merely stomach-turning. A stocky, wild-eyed Oliver Reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as Father Grandier, the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century French town, and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake. Gemma Jones is one bright spot as Grandier's innocent love interest, and Ms. Redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of Sister Jeanne, but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing. Not for the faint of heart!"
2,"A talented cast cannot save ""The Devils""","Wow, where do I begin with this oddity? I really tried to like this film, but found it brutal and offensive to women. Extensive torture scenes, and Catholic bashing (ok, it was the Inquisition but this film is ridiculous!) make for a lame flick.Two stars for the acting of Oliver Reed (always a favorite). This movie also is very long and doesn't sustain interest."
4,Powerful!,"A very powerful and mind blowing movie. I agree with the three previous reviews that this movie can be viewed both religiously or politically but more importantly it can be viewed as psychedelic candy for the eyes, thus should be made available on DVD. The film should be given more credit for it's epic shot locations and highly detailed sets. Wardrobe is bizarre and decorative and the acting is very bold and strong. A Huxley story twisted with Ken Russell's early directing gives us an explosive mix. Only down point is that the movie is a little long but still very worth the time."
5,Ken Russell goes to Hell,"""A mad film is what the world needs,"" Ken Russell--That was his opinion of ""The Devils"" in 1970 when he was interviewed at the Cannne film festival- where his film of the Aldous Huxley novel was thoroughly drubbed by critics.This ""is"" a mad movie. Russell's visionary cross-breeding of historical realism and unhinged surrealism is un-matched in all cinema.This film is a crazy masterpiece that deserves the ultimate Criterion treatment-- not to be missed by any fan of deeply strange movies."
2,Devils reissue not the same as original release,"The original Devils was released as an X-Rated Movie. The R rated version that is available on video today is severely cut to omit sexual scenes such as the dream sequence (vannessa redgrave character), and some of the torture scenes (oliver reed)."
2,CUT OR UNCUT??,"Yes, just heard of the BFI releasing 'The Devils' on dvd next March,fantastic.Oh dear,its the original 'X' cert British release.Calm down again everyone."
5,Great Kid movie!,"Why did Disney wait so long? Our son has loved this movie since it was first shown during Halloween,1997. Every few months or so, we would look on Amazon.com to see if it was available for sale. We taped it years ago but the quality of the tape is poor and it is worn out so I was so happy to finally see it available on DVD at Amazon.com and ordered it immediately. The acting by the kids isn't so great, but the story is fun and the theme music is memorable. Bill Fagerbake is great as the mummy. Our son just loves the fact that he is in this film and is also ""Patrick"" from ""Sponge Bob Square Pants"" and one of the Criterion Brothers in one of our other favorite movies, ""Funny Farm"". This movie is heart warming and fun. It didn't win any awards, but it is an enjoyable Halloween film that can be watched anytime during the year. Thanks Disney and Amazon.com!"
2,Don't unwrap,I love corny movies but this was really bad. I cann't believe I bought it. I don't even think young kids would like. It was just a waste of time.
4,Under Wraps,"Two boys and a girl try to help a mummy back to his sarcophagus, which they had accidentally unearthed, before midnight on Halloween. This brings about several problems. Where to hide the mummy, how to feed it and also how to protect it from the bad guys who want it for other reasons. This is good fun for the kids. Would be great to watch on Halloween."
5,Under Wraps DVD,Ordered two DVD's of the movie and received them in a timely manner....I have had no problems ordering things on Amazon....great opportunity is provided to us by this company on the net.
4,Nat's Review,"I love tamagotchi they are very fun. The only problem is that they potty a lot. Besides that they are the perfect toy. To use for parenting skills. I really like the stuff they sell, and they have a cool website to get free stuff and cool games."
5,Tamagotchis Rule,I think tamagotchis rock. Not only are they fun to play with but they teach you the responsibilities you are going to face in life. They are really fun to play with.From Rosanna
5,u have 2 get a tomagotchi V3!,"tomagotchis are really cool and if u r a adult reading this I would recomend it for your child if they r in the age group of 7-15. Tomagotchis are really fun and can teach u alot of responsibility. they r so awesome and there r way many more choices on tomagotchi V3.i'm not some crazy toma fan, i only have 1 v2 and 1 v3. but i find them very fun. if u don't have one yet, i would look on amazon cuz they r hard 2 find!!!!!!!!"
4,Awesome,"I have three tamagotchi connections and they are so awesome! They are fun to play with and it allows you to know what it is like to care for a virtual creature that can actually die if you don't take care of it properly. They are adorable whether they are baby's, children, teenager, or an adult. It's like living out the your life once you have a child. Your baby turns into and adult and then, if you would like it to, it can get married and you could have a virtual grandchild that you can care for once the original parent says bye-bye. You can live out your life in a week."
5,Tamagotchi,"This is the best thing ever!!! You can go on an website and get presents. You get paswords too !!!!!And you get cute pets ! There so cute! I realli didn't want the all clear pink color but that was the only one left so I had totake it.I realli wanted the blue one with circles.

1,Toilet seat hinge bolts,I'd bought a new toilet seat and snapped the plastic screw by tightening it too tightly. Ordered these. DID NOT FIT. Thread too wide. Had to go to Lowe's and find metal ones that do fit.
4,John Kitzman on trombone with Janice Hodges on Piano,"I first listened to this recording over 15 years ago when I had it on a vinyl LP. John Kitzman plays the trombone solos in a beautiful manner. I really enjoyed his playing in the Hindemith Sonata for Trombone and Piano. All trombonists attempting to master this piece should listen to this fine recording. Janice Hodges is also amazing in this work in her perfect rendition of an incredibly difficult piano part. This Hindemith work is frustrating for trombonists because it is hard to find a pianist willing to play the piano part with its very challenging fast sections, unusual harmonies and chord progressions."
4,hernia belt,"the hernia belt does work . I am on my third day but there are adjustments , you will have too address and in my case some major modifications. one of the reviews suggested to buy on the large side and I did . I am 41"" on the fence between med and large so on the recomendation I chose the large. now I am forced to take about 4"" out of the belt"
4,San Joaquin Valley poetry,This author has had dramatic experiences as a farm laborer. He communicates them extremely well in parts one and two of his book. Part three is about a Godless life and a tough marriage. I didn't enjoy this last section.
2,Not very bright,"Not a very bright light and the strobe function (even at it's fastest) was really just a flashing light. It would probably work in a small room and should be geared towards children. Not really a ""party"" light."
2,strobe light,"It was pretty weak not as strong as I wanted, ok for kids for sleep overs or little parties"
3,Great for young kids,My ten year old son has used this strobe for his room on sleep overs with his friends and still loves using it.Alan Safani
4,A review star is lost for not including a few songs,"One of my favorite bands. Of All Time. You can't expect me to totally agree with a best-of compilation, do you? The second CD is great (4-star), the main reason why I bought the thing. However, I really believe there's a reason these songs were never released until now - they didn't belong or they didn't measure up. Measuring up means being 5-star orgasmic stuff like Let It Be, Tim, and Pleased To Meet Me.Regarding the best-of Cd, why they didn't include a few of the following is beyond me: ""Hold My Life"",""Waitress in the Sky"",""Little Mascara"",""I Don't Know"", ""Nevermind"", ""Valentine"", and ""Red Red Wine"",""Shooting Dirty Pool"".What am I saying? It's all so good, how can I even complain. If you need a taste of the Replacements but can't afford more than one CD, I guess this one pretty much has the most to offer."
2,No!,"Make no mistake, the Replacements is one of America's greatest lost rock 'n' roll bands. This collection just doesn't do them justice.Unfortunately, their recorded output is split between two different lables -- Twin Tone was their first home, and they finished at Warner Brothers. Everything on this collection is from the latter with none of the former. It's like a Rolling Stones compilation that gives you ""Tumbling Dice"" and ""Miss You"" but leaves off ""Satisfaction"" and ""Jumping Jack Flash.""The Replacements made good and great albums. These songs are out of context, and attempt to convey the band as a ""hit machine"" which they certainly never were. On their own, they just don't pack the same punch as in their original setting. (The B-sides are the only reason I give this any stars.)It's been noted before, I will note it again: If you are curious about the Replacements, get ""Let It Be."" It's their masterpiece. If that record does nothing for you, go no further."
2,What are you gonna do with your life?nothing!,"If anything buy this album for their cover of ""another girl, another planet."" That particular track is worth the twenty five bucks. Most of the songs here are pretty good, the ones off TIM are magnificent, the ones from don't tell a soul should have been omitted.In anycase this is an awful retrospective considering who the band is. I wish sire would concentrate on releasing some of the band's live material."
2,Overrated......,"I could never figure out the buzz about the Replacements. Everything I read about them hails them as the rock and roll messiahs of sort. I expected Johnny Thunders-ish raunch. What I hear are for the most part very lame ballads, with a few mediocre mid-paced rockers thrown in; nothing real powerful at all. I find myself constantly skipping to the next track, wondering when it will begin to rock. It never does. Granted, the first album and 'Stink"" are more of what I expected, but the stuff after that was all radio-friendly fodder."
3,Beautiful losers,"In a way, this is the perfect Replacements 'Greatest Hits' collection. Too expensive to attract any new fans and sure to piss off longtime fans as they shell out $23 for that one B-side they don't have already. Plus, as an added bonus, it doesn't even have any of the Twin Tone catalogue. Thus, even half a decade after they've disbanded, the Mats manage to flirt with greatness and then fail spectacularly."
1,Unsatisfied Customer,"When I received the earrings, they were 14K gold, but the size where much smaller than the photo I saw on Amazon.com. Since they stated they regularly retail for $100.00 I expected a much larger size. I will not purchase anything else from Silver Speck again."
3,Basic idea never really hit home from a leadership standpoint,Author focuses on mother daughter relationships making it difficult to relate for non-parent readers. It's okay but found it boring. Meh.
5,A reality check for women,This book a wonderfull eye opener. It makes you realize why we behave the way we do around women. It helps you acknowlege those little behaviors and act differently upon them.
1,Not a true story,"I found this book to be a horrible misrepresentation of women. Not all working women are whiny, competitive, cut throat, man stealers. The section on mothers and daughters was particularly bad - if a majority of relationships are as bad as she portrays I wonder how we survive as a civilized society. And the part of the book where the author is supposed to give the reader information on how to deal with all this supposed back stabbing is missing. I would not recommend this book and I hope that any man that ends up reading it will not blindly believe that the women he knows act the way the author suggests. We don't."
4,It tells it like it is,"After encountering one of the worst situations regarding women in the workplace a few weeks ago this couldn't have come at a more perfect time. I first saw Diane Sawyer from Good Morning America talking about it and immediately went online and ordered it. I read it cover to cover however it would have been more helpful if more solutions were offered in the different situations. Even though the author covers solutions the majority of the book is focused on confirming what most of us know when it comes to jealousy, rivalry, and envy. However it doesn't hurt to see it in print - a real reality check. If all females would read this then maybe we could start correcting the problems."
5,The Women Wars,"Ms. Shapiro Barash's witty approach to the serious topic of female rivalry manages to be both entertaining and informative. Without minimizing the issues, she describes how ""Snow Queens and Soccer Moms"" spar over their children and ""Perpetual Beauty Contests"" last a lifetime. But her strategies for overcoming the relationally aggressive behaviors driven by competition and jealousy are what may help readers most. They should be part of every girl's middle school--or perhaps elementary--education."
4,Present for my grandson,"Bought this as a present for my 3 1/2 yr old grandson & he loved it.It's a large sized, colorful batman.The foam ""bullets"" seem to be very soft and safe, and the price was a great deal for the product.Would recommend this toy to friends with small children."
2,ok for a child that is easy to entertain,"these batmans were larger than i thought they would be, which is ok. his arms and legs can move, but there isnt much else to the toy. since there are so many electronic toys out know, a child will get bored with this toy. ours is collecting dust now."
4,awesone Batman toy,"i bought this on Amazon around Christmas time as a little present for myself because i'm a collector and i've always had a soft spot for Batman toys. this figure is so big and cool-looking, i couldn't resist, and Amazon was selling it for $[...] plus free shipping, so there was no way i could turn this one down. it is a great-looking figure. however, the ugly protruding yellow shoulder mount for the cannon is an eye sore, so being a collector, the toy loses a star with me for it. this toy is definitely aimed at younger kids who don't care too much about that sort of thing, but it's still a great toy nonetheless."
2,Not as good as should be,"I'm one of the biggest fan of Julie Garwood. I love all her books and have the whole collection or most of it. I do have to say that her historical stories are the best of them all, while I liked the change of HeartBreaker and was open to the idea of Julie's new style I was a bit disapointed by Mercy, and almost didn't make it to the end of KillJoy.I think it is from far the only book that shouldn't be worth buying.But try her historical books, they are amazing!"
4,FELT SOMETHING MISSING,"I just finished listening to KILLJOY a few days ago. I liked the story, but I felt a bit cheated by the fact that Julie didn't bring Jilly (Mom) and Avery (Daughter) together in a more climatic ending between the two of them.I suppose I have either read or listened to so may of these books by Romance?Thriller authors that I feel a bit jaded at times.I can't say that I disliked the book, but I guess I felt something was mixing and not as climatic as I thought it should have been."
2,I didn't like the album,"I really liked the song Veronica and was extremely disappointed at the rest of the album. Sometimes when you like one song, you find that you like all of the others by that artist, and then sometimes you find a song you really like and nothing else you like. This was the case. But I really love the song Veronica, so that is why this album got 2 stars."
3,Extreme Honey - Elvis Costello,"For those who knew and loved Elvis C. in the early years with the Attractions, this CD will probably disappoint. It's altogether too dark and moody, but it does show the range and diversity of EC. There are some good rockers reminiscent of the Attraction years: 13 Steps Lead Down, Veronica, The other Side of Summer, and Kinder Murder. It's good for those who want a more complete collection without making the investment in the more recent CDs. If this is the ""best"" of the Warner Bros. years, the CDs must ahve been largely forgetable. For my money, I'm sticking by all the stuff he did with the Attractions--you still can't beat My Aim is True, Armed Forces, and Get Happy--Classic Elvis!"
3,Good Sampling of Later Stuff,"For anyone looking for one Costello album for their collection, this ISN'T it. (For that, get ""Girls, Girls Girls"" which covers the first 10 years of his career.)Having only listened to two of his albums of the past 10 years, I can't say with certainty that anything has been overlooked. But the reason I bought it was that I hoped it would help fill me in on what he's been up to over the past decade.Sadly, there is only one track from ""The Juliet Letters"" (a MUST have) here. I believe that the addition of more music from this one-album stint with the Brodsky Quartet might have helped.There are some nice moments on this ""Best Of"" collection (like the tracks composed with McCartney), but more than anything, its made me happy that I didn't blow dough on his later albums."
3,From egg to chicken,"This is a wonderful book for children and adults to read to children. There is however, a mistake that should be corrected in the book. After having raised dozens and dozens of chickens, the real truth is chickens do NOT lay several eggs at a time. They lay only ONE EGG at a time and it takes about 25 hours for a chicken to produce and egg, so you can generally expect an egg a day from each chicken, (some do lay less)Please do more research and correct this mistake. There are many children who will believe what you write and it needs to be the absolute truth. Thanks!"
3,lots of topic covered,I tend to agree with other reviewrs that this book is by no means for beginners. We had it for a junior level course in advanced electronics and I learned a lot about amplifiers from this book. The maths is a little too much to handle at times but it really clarifies the theory once you get it.
2,Not a good reference,"This book is typical of someone who writes a book not for the readers but just to have his/her name on a book. If you use thistextbook for your course, I really hope that you have a goodprofessor who takes the time to explain it. If your prof is justaverage, which is what happened in our case, most of the peoplein the class will likely be lost. I believe giving 2 stars tothis book is generous; and my advice is, don't waste your time."
1,This book blows,This is the most confusing book that I have read since I've been in the engineering department(4 years). This book needs to never be demanded for students to study from. This may be the worst book I have used since my book that I used for Numerical Methods. Everybody in my class agrees. University of Maryland College Park. (UMCP)
3,Good in a Very Microsoftish Way,"Encarta is good. It is very easy to use. It has a web site that a registered user could access. Its world map is far superior than the Encyclopaedia Britannica's. However, its contents are sometimes not that good.For example, I searched ""John Rawls,"" a prominent moral and political philosopher, today. Its first line reads:[ Rawls, John (1921-), American moral and political philosopher, whose major work, A Theory of Justice, has had a profound impact on ethics and political theory since its publication in 1971. ]For God's sake, Rawls died on Nov 22, 2002. It's March 21, 2004 today. And Encarta, which supposedly should be updated weekly, did nothing to correct this mistake."
2,Same old thing,"I usually only write reviews when I have postive comments, but I was disappointed in this years version of Encarta. It has very few improvements or new features.Although the content will always remains secondary to the real encyclopedia publishers. I always enjoyed seeing what new flashy features Microsoft has come up with... (and 10 new videos was not good enough for me).There is no question that this is the best functioning encyclopedia (at least if you are using Windows and other Microsoft products) but without any new flash... and considering the nature of the content I can not recommend anyone purchase this product (and will probably see if I can return mine)."
2,Horrible interface - crazy caroussel on your screen!,"Encarta's interface has for years been much better than Britannica's, but this year's edition (2004) is different. In one word: horrible!Bill Gates and Co. put not only a very loud welcome noise (you should always turn your speakers off before running Encarta), but also a FAST MOVING CARROUSEL of pictures on your screen. There is no use of it except that you quickly get a SEVERE HEADACHE or VERTIGO looking at it. And there is no way to turn this monstrous thing off!So, if you already have a not too old copy of Encarta on your computer, and you are not a caroussel maniac or a two or three years old child, better SKIP 2004 CAROUSSEL EDITION of Encarta and WAIT FOR A NORMAL EDITION."
4,Grandma on the move,This is one of my favorite stories. I share it with children all the time. I read to groups on a regular basis. The book has a great message of acceptance and enviornment impact. Make children think about the discissions they are making and how they impact the world around them.
3,good condition but slow,The book arrived in great condition. Better than discribed. It took a lot longer than any other place I have used on amazon.
3,It's cool but there's a catch.......,"""My love is the Shhhh"" was kinda hott so I felt inspired to pick up this CD. OK, here's the catch: no other tracks on the album are like that track. So if you are like me (heard it on the radio so much that you ended up falling for that song and wanting more) you'll be disappointed. BUT in all fairness, if you are able to disregard that factor, it's a cool album! My favorites are ""My love is the Shhhhh"", ""Days like this"", ""Take it or Leave it"", and ""Act like you want it"".Sidebar- S.F.P. were the guys who sang on Will Smith's song ""just the two of us"". I know you couldn't live without that small tidbit of information. :-)"
3,only hit: My love is the Sh...,"Unfortunately ""My love is the Sh..."" is the only outstanding song for SFP. The rest is in the same style - even the earlier stuff - but not with as much hit potential. This album containing their hit is a bit better than the previous ones due to their guestsingers like Trina &Tamara."
5,Worked for this beginner!,"This book is inspiring to look at - so inspiring I had to try doing it! I have only been knitting for about six months and learned to knit from an internet site, books, and a few pointers from my local yarn shop. After giving the book a good reading, I got out the yarn and needles and cast on and watched the great video clip on their web site and practiced! Within two hours, I was knitting away! It is amazingly easy and fun to do and the results are fantastic! (This could become addictive.) I am ordering some of their wool to try out and then plan to embark upon a sweater!"
5,New way to knit fair isle,"What a great book for learning a new way to knit Fair Isle sweaters! Requires reader to have some knowledge of knitting, but the technique is easy to learn after some practice. No more tangled yarn or puckered surfaces when switching colors. Book also contains some of the background on ""Philosphers Wool"" which I found interesting. Contains some great patterns and encourages a knitter to use imagination when combining colors."
3,I was disappointed,"This book was too focused on their particular company, their yarns, their techniques. Not too much to generalize from. Pictures are GORGEOUS and the sweaters are too -- though so modern-looking! I wanted something more along the lines of teaching the traditions in general, and also wanted discussion of how the colors are chosen & matched up. However if you want specific patterns & want to use their yarns (which are beautiful but beyond my budget), this is a good book."
4,Caution,"Yes, a lovely and useful book. Yes, two-handed knitting is the way to go. But CAUTION... only if you are willing to cut steeks. If you don't know what that means, probably the idea doesn't scare you, and you should go ahead and buy this book and proceed unawares and unafraid. Wish I could. But I can't. The idea of cutting my multi-stranded knitting to pick up sleeve stitches or cardigan edges just terrifies me. (Sorry, Meg Swansen, I couldn't do it even for you!) Just me. Too timid. With that little caveat aside... lovely and useful book. :-)"
3,disappointing.,"with the fantastic intro of ""just another illusion,"" the listener is instantly drawn into this cd. unfortunately, that song and more or less the cd never quite recapture that original burst of excitement. the vocals are dull and unoriginal, and the choruses might as well be the verses. a pleasant enough listen, but not something that you will take permanent residence in your cd player unless you are looking for a funkier oasis."
3,Worth owning for a few very good songs,"""Step Into My World"" is the main reason to own this album. If Andy just could have written one other track this good, the band might still be together. Instead, it will always stand alone as Hurricane #1's only truely great song. However, ""Just An Illusion"", ""Monday Afternoon"", and ""Smoke Rings"" are very good songs. I like a lot of the other tracks as well. Two tracks in particular get on my nerves. ""Chain Reaction"" is just plain boring, and was a terrible single choice for the band. ""Stand In Line"" however is the worst. It starts off as an obvious, and more importantly uninteresting Beatles rip-off (I quite enjoy better Beatles rip-offs, such as almost all of Oasis's good songs), then goes on for far longer than any mediocre song should. All in all, not a great album. Their second one is better overall, but again do buy this album for ""Step Into My World""."
2,Not great! D'You Know What I Mean?,"This is an album which is not terrible, but then again it's not great. . .there are moments of almost greatness on some tracks, 'Mother Superior', 'Stand In Line' (even though it's a Beatles rip off) and a few others. However, generally I was really disapointed with this record, I was expecting more. On this showing their name should not be ""Hurricane #1"" but ""Slight-breeze #1""."
3,Very Hard to Read,"I just purchased this book through Amazon and was not thrilled with it. The font was hard to read with the typing set to justify instead of left instead of everything aligned on the left. Also, there were many graphs and charts in the book but the downside is that they were all black and white. The author refers to different color lines on the graph when in fact it is just black and white print. Found several typo errors involving numbers and other words. I will keep this book for a reference but I do not think it is good for a beginner. The overviews of different technical indicators and such leaves a person hanging for an explanation instead of just a brief overview. The author throws so many figures and numbers out making it hard to understand what is happening."
4,scooper improvement,"The long handle is very useful for me to use as I am confined to a wheelchair and have limited movement. It does the job except the screen holes could be about half the size. This would greatly improve the filtering out of the smaller waste material, something the manufacturer might consider in upgrading their product. Keith Burkholder"
5,fanastic scooper,Truly the best that I have ever usedThe shipping I think is too much since I ordered 12 and they charged individual shipping for each one but other than that it is wonderful.
1,My oponion is thumbs down.,"I didn't find one thing in this book that I would even want to put my time knitting. This purchase was a random thing and my fault, I just took a chance that disapointed me. The seller gave a fast delivery and book in good condition."
1,spend the extra money on a better battery,"Battery is well constructed and fits correctly. Does NOT hold a charge for very long even with minimal transmitting. Bottom line- if you depend on the radio that this is used in, spend the extra money on a better battery."
3,President DVD,Doesn't keep score between teams. Not sure some of the answers are well-researched as I have found contradictions with other books/programs on the Presidents.
5,Garage Heater,"Purchased three weeks ago, this heater exceeded my expectations. I have a two car garage without insulation and I am using the low setting to heat up to 60F. The thermostat works perfectly. I am very happy with this product."
4,Almost Perfect!,This is a nice unit. It heats very good and is pretty quiet as it does it's job. I'm using it as the sole heat source for my 24 x 36 heated shop area. I have no complaints about it except for the thermostat sensitivity. It has too much variance between where it shuts off and where it starts again. It will let the temperature drop about 5 degrees before turning the heater back on. I plan to add a wall thermostat and wire it into the heater. That will take care of the problem. Otherwise I'm 100% happy with it.
5,Warmer in Wyoming.,"Great product and works as advertised. I have a 450 squart foot insulated garage in a very cold climate and this heater provides enough heat to keep the garage at a comfortable temperature year round. I keep the heater on a low setting to keep the garage at 55 degrees when it is freezing outside, but the dial can be adjusted to increase the temperature when needed. The heater was fairly easy to install once the electrical line has been installed."
3,Not impressed,"After reading some reviews I thought this was suppose to work great. But, I guess these people don't live in MN. I have a 3 car garage (more like a 2.5), nothing huge. Sheetrock-ed with insulator, insulated doors.Had this on high last night, it was -7 outside. Didn't feel much warmer inside. It works great if it's around 20-30 and you have it on high. I was actually putting some cabinets together in my sweatshirt, no jacket. But don't be fooled, this is not for real winter!"
1,Don't buy it,"As a chemical engineer most of our programs are in Fortran. I am an expert level Visual C++ developer and I am currently working on a project to develop an Excel GUI for a simulation in Fortran DLL's. I bought this book to widen my Visual Fortran knowledge, it does not offer anything, nothing new and everything is outdated. The print quality is poor resolution of the screen shots are very low; you cannot read anything in figures. I am not rating this book low by being an expert Visual C++ developer, I am rating this book low as a Visual Fortran User.I bought this book yesterday and I am going to sell this book right now. Anyone interested?"
4,Using Compaq Visual Fortran,To really understand the book (Compaq Visual Fortran) one must use the Fortran programming examples with the book (Companion Site )! I think the author did a very good job is making one dig out the meat of the text. I would also get the Digital Visual Fortran Programmers Guide (Michael Etzel and Karen Dickinson) if you are serious about the above subject matter.
5,Kudos for National Geographic Traveler books,"I have found the National Geographic Traveler books to be ideal when planning a visit to a city. The San Francisco book seems up to the usual standards. These books cover the more interesting attractions, including some great photos, and are organized by area, which makes it easier to select what you want to see and plan your days. Another feature which should not be overlooked is the section in the back, which recommends some excellent restaurants."
2,Took to 3 week to reach,"Very slow, my trip was already over when i got this, book was in good condition though"
1,Unprofessional,"I was extremely disappointed in the overall approach to this inane video. It was dark and grimey, and narrated with a campy dialogue that distracted one from viewing it seriously."
2,Over-priced and nothing new,I have always been leery of purchasing pdf books. This one just reinforces the suspicion that they are over priced and poorly written.
4,Great starting-point,I highly recommend NGNM as a starting-point for anyone with an interest in philosophical anarchism. It's an anthology of writings from the major figures that provides not only an introduction to the foundational concepts but some sense of the different themes within anarchism as well. Well done!
5,Great read and a great book to give to friends!,This is the perfect book for any SEC fan. I couldn't put it down and I plan to give it as a gift to all of my friends.
5,You'll Love SEC Sports Quotes!,"Written by Sam KingAdvocate Sportswriter10/29/2002GOOD READ: ""SEC Sports Quotes,"" a book of quotes compiled by Chris Warner, is a good read for sports fans in general and LSU fans in particular. LSU Athletic Director Skip Bertman, often quoted in the book, might say it would also be a good book in Starkville -- if it was all pictures. Bertman, who joked about Starkville and Mississippi State in his years as a baseball coach, is quoted often in the book. A couple: ""Starkville is an Indian word for trailer park. ""In Starkville, there is only one beauty parlor and they only give estimates."" Present Tigers baseball coach Smoke Laval gets in his shot. ""Who's the loneliest man in Starkville? The Tooth Fairy."" Actually, Bertman loves Starkville and may soon have LSU fans parking their motor homes there and being bused to games in Tiger Stadium. - Sam King, The Advocate"
2,Is it a book or a political dissertation?,"I have read most of Ms Strabenow's books and always looked forward to a new hardcover. In her latest Kate Shugak novel however, she spends an excessive amount of time lecturing the reader on her political views. I do not purchase books in order to be lectured to, whether or not I agree with the author's politics. I will not buy another hardcover by this writer. I will, instead, wait for it to come out in paperback. If this book also turns out to be a political lecture I will not purchase another. I do so hope Ms Stabenow gets off her soapbox and writes another book that is simply a good read."
2,Not So Fine,"If A Fine and Bitter Snow is typical of the Kate Shugak series, she is not my cup of tea. This book belongs in the romance section rather than the mystery section of the bookstore. The mystery of who killed a elderly local environmentalist plays a distant second fiddle to Kate's romantic entanglement. The killer's identity is obvious from moments after Trooper Jim arrives at the murder scene -- though the motivation caught me by surprise.Except for Shugak and Trooper Jim, the cast of characters seem like refugees from old Northern Exposure episodes. Everyone is simpatico, racial problems don't exist, law enforcement is enlightened and compassionate. Dana Stabenow makes the most significant problem in this arcadian utopia which of two hunky suitors Kate will finally bed. Even that isn't any mystery."
4,Not for newbies to Kate Shugak,"Don't read this book if it'd be your first Kate Shugak novel/mystery. Start at the beginning with A Cold Day for Murder and continue through the series, and then this one will be a better read. I've read the series in order from the beginning and really enjoyed this one, because I liked the increased time spent on the romantic story line."
2,Disappointing,"I'm an avid fan of the Kate Shugak series and read this book in short time. On reflection, I felt unsatisfied. It was as though I had finished a meal of take-out Chinese food and I was still hungry. I realized that the book seemed to lack substance and that the plot was almost an afterthought. I hope that this is an outlier and am about to read the next in the series. I know that some authors continue a series too long and the quality begins to drop. I hope that this is not the case with Kate, but I suggest that a fan may wish to skip this book."
3,Comparing Digital Image& Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook,Digital Image advantage continues to be smooth integration between photo editing and user friendliness. [...]I think many people are already looking to go beyond generic photo organizing capabilities and looking to the new generation of software like Memories that can handle all sorts of multimedia and is very easy to use
4,Much Easier than Photoshop,"This is an excellent product for the regular home user who wants to get the most out of their digital camera and color printer. It is very easy to use to do what most people really want to do. Adobe Photoshop by contrast requires a degree in Photoshop. I have both-and don't use Photoshop anymore. I see that a number of folks suggest buying the Adobe Elements suite instead of DIA9, so its clear that Photoshop has useability issues for the home user. But then I ask-do you want to buy a neutered version of Adobe (Elements) on its way down or do you want get on a path with a product which will continue to add features in Photoshops space that are easier to use?"
4,Great for beginners,"I do very little editing etc and this was just the software for me (a beginner). It has a lot of features and is very easy to use. It is not for the very serious editor (like my wife). If you want all the bells and whistles get something more expensive, However if you are like me and want to edit photos or make great slide shows with little effort then this IS the software for you."
4,Does the job,"Advantages:Simple interfaceAll the basic digital effects to correct a photoVery integrated with the other programsDisadvantages:Wastes lots of memoryNot advanced enough (compared to Adobe Photoshop or Fireworks)Not customizable enoughI used this software in addition to Fireworks and Microsoft Photo Editor. It is primarily for simple photo correction software. If you need more than this, try something else. It comes with an array of filters, banners, a library system to setup, and other things, but its all pretty simple stuff.For the price of $20 or less, its really worth it."
3,Somehow Not That Much Better Than PhotoDraw,"I was using PhotoDraw (Microsoft's predecessor to Picture It!) for basic photo editing since 1999. I picked up this new product primarily because of the library program. The library component works nicely, pretty much as advertised, but it's still pretty basic and not worth [the money]on its own. So I expected the photo editing software to be a marked improvement over PhotoDraw. It's not.There are some improvements, particularly giving the user more control over resolution, vastly improved printing options, and automatic white balancing. However, some PhotoDraw features are missing (""arrange"" function is sorely missed) or hard to use (filling a specific area with an effect or color is nearly impossible).So while this program has been stable and would likely suit someone looking for his first photo editing program, it's no world-beater and would be a much more convincing value if priced [lower]."
2,CPU killer,"Pros:cool features such as organizing pictures using keywords.Versatile.Satisfies average user.Cons:CPU consuming!!!!I am using a P4 2.4Ghz 512MB PC. Everytime i open the ""Digital Image Library"", the CPU usage immediately goes to 100% continuously and the pictures start flashing! When i use this amazon window the cover the library window, the CPU usage drops down immediately. It looks like the library is constantly refreshing the pictures. I am sure there is sofware defects with this product because displaying the pictures shouldn't be that CPU consuming.I decided not to use it to organize my pictures anymore because it's to uncomfortable to use a software that will monopolize the CPU."
1,Unspeakably awful,"Probably the worst electricity and magnetism textbook ever written. We used this for an intermediate level class, and not a single concept was adequately or reasonably explained. Wording is ambiguous, explanations and problem sets are unclear, and there are countless fundamental errors, both conceptual and mathematical. This book is so bad that it makes their Mechanics text look good by comparison."
1,Barger and Olsson Classical E and M Text,"I used this textbook as a college undergraduate in the late 1980s and thoroughly hated it. I have since advanced my education in Physics, and have found MUCH better textbooks -- Griffiths' text on E and M is FAR better.Barger's textbook is miles wide and millimeters deep. It resembles a book of mathematical formulas with practically no explanations or derivations. The notation is extremely difficult to decipher, and the book isn't arranged in any order. Topics are only loosely described, and there are few topics that are logically related.You would do better to pass this book by."
2,cover,Cover pretty much sucks. The color was peeling off before I even used it. I wouldn't recommend this cheap crap.
5,Fantastic Everyday Wine Glass,"Looks much more expensive than it is. A great everyday wine glass, when the Waterford is a bit too much. Highly recommended."
3,A gambler's adventures.,"Texas by the Tail by Jim Thompson chronicles the largely comic adventures of Mitch Corley, a gambling grifter whose theatre of operation is the great state of Texas. Since the plotting is more than a little haphazard, it's useful to view Texas by the Tail as a series of vignettes rather than a conventional novel with a beginning, middle and end.Published only 2 years after The Grifters, a magnificently well polished Jim Thompson novel with similar subject matter, this book is a bit of a disappointment. Instead of telling a compelling and viscerally engaging story as he did in The Grifters, in Texas by the Tail, Thompson chose to fill the narrative with a series of disparate scenarios. These scenarios are, in many cases, interesting in their own right, but they fail to gel together.Bottom line: A disappointing misfire by an author capable of much, much better. Probably of interest to diehard Jim Thompson fans only."
2,Too many plot holes,"I'm a huge Jim Thompson fan and have read 15 of his books. TEXAS BY THE TAIL is not one of his best. Some of the writing is quite good, and I liked the characters. However, there were far too many plot holes and coincidences. Yeah, that can be said about most of Thompson's books, but it's particularly true here. The plot concerns Mitch Corley, a professional gambler, and his attempts to scam people in Houston. He has a wife who won't divorce him and a girlfriend who doesn't know he's married. Plus, he's starting to make some powerful people mad about his gambling cons. I actually found myself rooting for Corley, but the resolution left me wondering what happened.Overall, this book is second tier Thompson. I'd recommend THE GRIFTERS or POP. 1280 instead. However, Thompson completists likely will enjoy it more than the average reader."
1,Reader by the tail...,"This book reads like it was pieced together from notebooks found in a motel after the writer left town. I would only recommend it to someone on my s-list. I thought the cover looked interesting when I picked it up at the bookstore, but now I dislike that as well."
3,"Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive.","Roger M. Keesing's ethnography of the Kwaio people leaves a bit to be desired. Though he goes into considerable detail about the Kwaio way of life, he repeats himself an incredible amount. Keesing literally says the same thing on both sides of the page. Other than that, the ethnography is not bad; all aspects of the society are duly explored. The presentation is a bit problematic in that he uses single-letter initials to describe people. Hearing that A, C, K, and G went to H's house just doesn't describe much to me. Apart from this, the work is good."
4,Inspiring and down to earth,"What do you feel as the doctor tells you, ""You have cancer!"" The blood rushes to you head, you sweat and bile tries to come up your throat all at the same time. Julie Marlin tells her life and death story of breast cancer, while at the same time coping with the tragic death of her parents in an automobile accident. She has to make a choice, live or die, and she chooses life. She appoaches her story with wit, fear and just trying to live life one day at a time. This is just a good book to read, like someone saying to you as you walk down the street, ""Come up and sit with me on the porch and I'll tell you a story."" Just a darn good book."
3,Helpful information in this book.,The book gave good insight about American Democracy and help me throughout my class. I found my self reading chapters not required for class.
3,Easy to read,This book is easy to read. It does not always explain exactly what a professor wants you to talk about when posting on line. If you need this book then I would get it but if you just want a book to read. This is not the book.
5,DEMOCRACY ?,"NUMBER ONE THIS BOOK STATES THAT ACCORDING TO AMERICAN VOTES,(the number of votes) AL GORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND RIGHTLY WON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2000, NOT BUSH !!! CAN YOU SAY BOUGHT ELECTION? WHOSE BROTHER WAS AND IS THE GOVERNER OF FLORIDA? THE STATE WHERE THE ELECTION WAS DECIDED? WHERE THERE WAS ""SUPPOSEDLY"" A PROBLEM WITH UNCOUNTED VOTES, OR THE COUNTING OF VOTES, FOR ""SOME STRANGE REASON"" ??? WHO COMES FROM ""OIL MONEY"" AS IN , THEY HAVE PLENTY OF, IN WHICH TO BUY ANYTHING THEY WANT, INCLUDING ELECTIONS ???"
2,Okay,"The book is okay on the information it gives in the text, but the supporting graphs and charts are always biased against the south. Patterson adds unnecessary clauses that insinuate stupidity and poverty. Also, he will always ask questions about why the South is lacking even though the graph says otherwise. Also, he mainly only shows one side politically. If it isn't required get another book"
2,Tension & Release:Springing the Blue,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ This Dvd put me to sleep. The world dosent need another blues is video. To much talking that cut into all the preformances. The only good thing was Debra Coleman's Preformance in the bonus section. All I wanted was to see complete songs preformed by blues artist. Heck Some of the artist arent even blues preformers.
2,Children's book?,"I won't summarize this book since others have capably done so. What I will add is that I am surprised this is a children's book. I read constantly and voraciously as a child, and continue to read children's books as an adult, and I did not like this book. The storyline was hard to follow with too many plots competing with one another. Also, with so many different groups and interests represented, as a reader I never got attached to any of them, there was little development of each groups motivations. Even Mosca, the main character, wasn't appealing to me nor realistic. While there were moments of great description and passages that were brilliant, I felt this book tried to make too many statements and use too many flowery words instead of telling a story. I think it will ultimately be highly unaccessible to the majority of kids."
2,"Long, meandering, boring","My kids and I read many of the same books. We're not disappointed very often, but with this one we were. The plot meanders, and the main character is quite uninteresting. While there's a lot going on at times, it's not fun to follow and also because there was much repetition of the characters' not-too-insightful inner monologue. Often even my 10-year-old son would say ""well, duh"" to the character's thoughts. Perhaps they were meant to be dull and uninteresting?"
1,"sorry, but it is not too good","As a 10 year old reader, i really had a hard time understranding this book. I tried to get past the 1st chapter, but i couldn't. it was just too hard to understand! It was also very boring. i mean, i love all types of books, but this, this was just too hard."
2,Not my favorite,I can hardly believe I'm the only one who didn't think this was entirely original. The whole idea of a world with banned books and magic isn't new. Several other books and series have this theme. Though I did like the humor in some ways it wasn't that good.
3,Poor Suction.,"Baught package for a little more than power supply would be. Product works well, except for suction cup. Tends to fall unexpectedly. When it fell in the Chevy Cruze I just baught, hitting a trim panel, I gave up on it. ill never yse it again. All the Garmens Ive owned seem to have this problem.. The suppy works as expected, though."
4,Makes Life Easier,"This OEM Prodect works perfectly with my Nuvi. I have had no problems so far, although I have not used the suction cup mount (just the charger and the black piece that hooks up the garmin to my dashboard garmin stand).The only reason it lost a star is because I known from previous experience that the charger is susceptible to breaking, I've had one fall apart for no apparent reason before."
4,"Bad Price Point for an Older Product, yet does the job","I recently took out my ""old"" but updated Garmin Nuvi 370 from storage for a trip to Europe and realized that the car charger, back clip for windshield mount was missing. Buying each item individually would have cost less, but decided to get this package, so I can have what I need in one box. So unless you need everything in the box, see if you can find a better deal. And yes, all the accessories does work, so no complaints about that."
4,Graming Mount,I purchased this mostly for the mount to the GPS unit but for the price you get the charger and 2 mounts for basicly the same price as just the mount
2,False Advertisement - Only Half of What Was Purchased,They ad said they would send a power cord and the mount - they only sent the mount. False advertisemnet.
2,not what i expected,"Pierre Rajotte wrore a book on how to handle, grow and preserve yeast. I found that book extremely valuable as a learning aid. This belgian ale tells a lot about belgian ale but really not enough about how to related items. I just wanted something else."
4,Good Survey of the Styles,"Rajotte's book may not be the ideal book for the beginning homebrewer, but I don't believe it's intended to be. For that, check out Palmer and many others. Rajotte's book gave me insight into what makes up these enigmatic brews. I brewed his saison recipe and was very pleased with the results, in fact, the beer was very favorably reviewed at a competition as being representative of the style. All in all, this book is a valued part of my brewing library."
3,"Useful, But Growing Increasingly Outdated","A good book for its time, and still a source of helpful bits of information here or there. Its biggest problem is that it has rapidly become outdated given advances in American knowledge of Belgian beers, ingredients, and brewing processes over the last twelve years. The discussion of saison in this book is especially disappointing - very little information on flavor profiles, brewing techniques, and not even a mention of Saison Dupont under classic examples (though to be fair, this now classic example of the style was not widely available outside of Belgium at the time of publishing). This book is worth looking at for serious brewers, but for those who want more up-to-date and thorough information, I would recommend the newer _Farmhouse Ales_ and _Brew Like a Monk_, both from Brewers Publications."
4,Great introduction to Belgian ales for home brewers.,"Well written, packed with info, this book has everything you need to make great Belgian ales at home. You may not perfect a Chimay clone on your first try, but you will probably produce a very drinkable beverage in the style!"
2,i'm quite sad,"It smells ok but I was disappointed that this is not the original fendi fragrance, it's a remake, it's powdery."
5,"Sticks to flat walls, not textured paint","Most, if not all murals, will only stick to flat walls. It's hard for certain backings to stay stuck to a textured wall. Just a thought before ordering anything mural-like. I hope this helps!"
5,Great product,My son and I love his new outer space room. The planets were very easy to put up and after adding some glow in the dark stars it was really great.
3,Just so-so,"My 6-year-old was really excited to put these on his wall. I followed directions exactly, but now that the decals are up, they're already starting to peel off. We'll probably just glue those parts on the wall. Also, it would have been helpful if the planets were more to scale. For example, the sun is really small in comparison to Jupiter, making the solar system look a little funny on the wall."
5,gorgeous,"I found these frogs very easy to put up, and very nice looking. Better than in the picture."
2,"Good product, bad shipping",The product was ok. However they didn't give information about tracking the product and we didn't know if the product was going to come or not as there was a big delay. It was an uncomfortable experience.
5,Easy to apply and great looking!,My son loves the planet wallies. He loves all things space and this goes great with his space bedding. Super easy to apply and durable. Would definetly buy again.
2,Look great but are not decals,"When we purchased these, the product description indicated they were REMOVABLE DECALS. We did not want to purchase wallpaper. Based on the descripition, we were expecting something that would peel and stick to the wall - like a DECAL. Something that we could REMOVE easily if we moved. These are most definitely wallpaper. We tried taping them to the wall using double stick tape, but that did not work. Needless to say we were disappointed. The reason they get two stars, instead of one, is that the detail really is great. They look really good."
2,I would not buy this again,"If you ever make a mistake, then there is no way to correct it. It only works one time. In addition, it is so much more cumbersome than other peek & stick wall stickers."
2,SA,The Mural only stay clued on the wall for 1 day even followed the instruction and it fell off was really disapointed with it had so many hopes for it.
