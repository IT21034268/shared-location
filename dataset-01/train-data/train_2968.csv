4,An soulful album,I bought this for the title song. It is so beautiful. I first heard it from Southern Rail at a local strawberry festival and heard it again from the same band. I am not a christian but think these songs are soulful.
5,A must have - inspirational!,"I just love this book. I've never been so inspired to make a trip to Home Depot - I couldn't wait to build my own cavalletti and get out there and give it a try. Directions for building your own can be found here: www.texashorsemansdirectory.com/thdcav.htm This book provides an excellent introduction to working with cavalletti and is a must have for the English rider. Easy to read, well illustrated, great schooling plans and the gymnastic jumping section at the end is an added bonus. FUN, FUN, FUN!"
5,It makes you want to go live with the Lakota,"It is a look into the lives of the Lakota Indian tribe. They are a beautiful and innocent people. One child's destiny leads her to be trained as a warrior. The warrior's destiny is linked to a white buffalo and a strange woman with pale skin and golden hair. It is a story of true love, honor and integrity. It is also a story of sadness and hurt. It will make you cry, but you will enjoy every minute of it! (Not to mention that some of the first part had me laughing out loud)It is a love story between two wonderful people who just happen to both be women. And if that makes it a ""lesbian romance"" then I guess that's what you would call it. But it is NOTHING like any ""lesbian romance"" you ever read, I guarantee it! It is mostly a story about a people (the Lakota).If you're looking for a story with steamy sex, this is not the book for you. But if you are looking for a wonderful love story, look no further."
5,A Beautiful Story,"D. Jordan Redhawk successfully weaves romance and historical fiction in this wonderfully written tale. I was drawn in from the very first pages and my interest never wavered. I found myself truly caring what happened to these rich, vibrant characters. The backdrop of Native American culture and early frontier life served to add even more depth to a very solid plot and believable characterizations. I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
5,A brave journey toward a healthy life,"Lynn Tolson shares her often harrowing journey of childhood abuse, mental illness within her family, denial, her own decent into darkness, then facing the truth, healing and emerging into light again a stronger and whole person. She survived not only child abuse, but drugs and suicide attempts. This is a story we do not often hear told from the first person, because so many people do not survive and heal as Lynn has. How Lynn was able to overcome these traumatic events to be the person that she is today, gave me a renewed sense of hope for life. It was very brave of Lynn to share her story with such depth and honesty.People that are facing a similar life path can read her book and know there is hope for a healthy life, for a second chance at creating a healthy adulthood for oneself."
2,NOT FOR ME,"I made it to page 94 of this 291 page book. Then I quit. It is going in the Good Will bag, or more likley a donation for the Union Gospel Mission. Too much God and salvation for me. I am happy the author got straightened out, but I am not interested in her story. I really found it rather boring reading about all her troubles-kind of like a daytime soap opera. I'm sorry her life was so screwed up, and I'm glad some people can find help with this book or find it interesting to read, but it is not for me."
1,Don't waste you money on this,She wasted so many pages on nothing. I wanted to know what helped and did't work I guess I was looking for some information on how to help someone with this type of problem not a 8 year's journal.
5,MUST READ for survivors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am just starting my healing journey, and this is the first book I read pertaining to the subject of sexual abuse. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!Lynn is a remarkable woman!!I could relate to her so much through this book. I constantly doubt myself that this happened to me, and this book has given me the HOPE I need. Her courage to write this book has blown me away. At this time in my life I am having memory problems as many sexually abused survivors do. This book opened my mind to healing, recovery, and the courage to heal. Her writing is absolutely captivating!!! I can honestly say this book has changed my life!! Thank you Lynn for having the knowledge and courage to be a HEROand write this book!"
2,Not so much,"I found this book a little slow moving and some of it just seemed a little too contrived for my taste. After having this book for several weeks, I still haven't quite finished it yet. I feel like I'm forcing myself to read something that just isn't that good. So, the book still sits."
2,Jean would be embarrassed.,"I read all day for a living, so at night, the only thing my poor brain can handle is fluff.This book is fluff.The plot is weak and the characters seem cartoon-like. The main character is beaten up by a drunk and then proceeds to make him coffee.Picture a famous TV personality trying to spend an anonymous morning at a public library, in the Reading Room.She shows up in a Jean Muir dress, expecting not to be noticed. By anyone.I do like the way Antonia Fraser writes. You get a full picture, whether you want it or not.The story bumps along. The ending is silly and disappointing. I did like the cat."
2,Dosn't Hang Together,"A SPLASH OF RED by Antonia Fraser is a title I picked up because I'd read with interest several of her historical works. Ms. Fraser does not have the special something that makes for a cozy read. The book was dull to the point of boring.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
5,El Mejor Disco de Navidad (1999),"Tremenda joya musical de Navidad, gracias al gallo. Con la misms calidad de los discos de salsa, Tito Rojas hizo buen trabajo en este disco."
4,Great for Amateur Use,"My daughter purchased this book for a friend's birthday, and they really enjoyed it, it is easy to use and follow, and they all read each other's palms at the party (they are all around 18). The recipient liked and still uses it, several months later. Worth the money if you have a casual interest."
3,An OK Book With A Few Good POints,"Actually, I do not see how this book would help you learn to read palms. You could find a marking in your hand and look it up in the book and get what they say it means...it is rather like a cookbook, similar to astrology cookbooks. It is useful in that you can look up a lot of the ""ingredients"" but you would probably not learn how to bake using it.I mean no disrespect to the author, but I flipped though it and promptly listed it for resale. There are many other much betetr palm reading books to be had."
1,Burned again,"I swore I would never buy a LaserLight anything again. They have to be the worst of repackagers. Horrible mastering, ugly artwork, no liner notes of any sort and absolutely no thought to the material. Alas, I didn't check the label before I clicked. Only one of the CDs is a 1940s compilation. A Sinatra/Crosby compilation and a Glenn Miller Christmas collection are discs two and three. Half of the Sinatra/Crosby disc is from an old broadcast (actually I think it is from their Christmas special - if so. it isn't even 40's). The quality is really, really bad. The Glenn Miller disc is actually a radio program and unless there is a secret Christmas message in Little Bug Jug, the Christmas label is a bit deceptive.Check out the offerings from ASV - their discs are always high quality."
1,Pretty Poor Compilation,"I have a large variety of Xmas music but found this set disappointing. Disk 1 is ok, and the other 2 are fair. Some of the recordings are poor as one of the other reviewers mentioned. Other Xmas music will probably deliver a better value."
4,"The book includes both patterns and stories, a sequel","I am the author of this book, a sequel to my first book, Legacy: The Story of Talula Gilbert Bottoms and Her Quilts. New quilts are made by old patterns and shown in color. New quilts feature 5 members of Kenan Quilt Guild, Lockport, NY. Quilters have responded favorably to Family Ties."
3,Some results,Felt a little naseous when I took it...I thought it had gotten rid of most of the pinworms as I didn't feel anything for 3 days. Unfortunately started feeling itching again so I may try to take this product again. They're hard to get rid of.
1,Pin-X,Regarding Pin-X; I'm not a complainer and I would love to say that it works but it doesn't.----Chopped up raw garlic does!
1,Messed me up!,"Something in this damaged my body over two years ago. The around my eyes turned purple 2 days after I took this and has been that way for years now. This might have been because it damaged my liver, but I have had problems for the last several years now with my gallbladder and I think it has to do with this product. I'm 28 and in great health, I eat Organic foods and dont eat fast food. Something in this product messed me up. I also researched this product and little to no medical research has been done on the active ingredient. I did find some cases of liver failure. I think this product damaged my liver and ultimately led me to gallbladder spasms. I would take caution when taking this."
4,They're no Strength in #s,"I wish I could give it 4 stars (I really do!), but it DOES deserve 4. ""Big Bug Shuffle"" is my favorite, but the disk slows down after that."
2,Hold on a minute. . .,"Unfortunately, this disk is nowhere near as interesting as it should be. That's not to say it's pedestrian, it just never really catches on like his recent ""Uncommon Ritual."" Here they just try very hard to sound spontaneous, and that is always a fearful motive."
5,Fantastic,What a great CD - I have it on my i-pod and it is the best music - transports one to another world
5,incredible,"This CD is for anyone, not for just that bluegrass crowd, these are three of the finest talents ever put together into one. I can never stop listening to this recording, because every single song is great. If you like this music, check out more of Jerry Douglas' stuff."
4,Excellent Collection of Early Rock & Roll,"Though it leaves off a couple of the pre-1955 hits that were just as influential as ""(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock,"" this CD gathers all the big hits from Bill Haley and His Comets' prime time. No liner notes, though each track has a list of who played what. All original versions--no rerecordings or live cuts, which other collections often include without warning."
2,Review for Mike Crosby's Young Rich and Dangerous,"to me only a couple songs on the cd are worth listening to. the rest of the cd is weak. the songs that i feel are tigh are na na na (rmx), get ya life, girl dont waste my time, luv my niggaz, unique horns, and birthday. the rest is HUFF!"
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!","Best book I've read on godly marriage. What a lot of Christians need to know about their marriages! This book describes how a husband and wife parallel Christ and the church. A must read for newlyweds, troubled marriages and old timers."
4,Great Value,"I seem to need a new tarp to cover my camper every other year, but I think this one will last longer. It's a little heavier than the heaviest (10 Mil) tarps I've been able to get locally. I think it's a good value for the money."
5,size problems !!!,"shoe looks great - ! - workmanship - design - material - packaging - individual dust bag for each shoe - feels comfortable - leather is soft and flexible - good arch support - etc. / I did research and knew it runs large (~1 size per reviewer @ Zappos!) - so, ordered a size down :) - the shoe is still big / should have gone 2 sizes down - would say it runs 1.5 - 2 sizes large / otherwise great shoe !!!"
4,Possibly my favorite Regency ever,This is easily Cindy Holbrook's best. Mandalee is a great heroine - Adam is completely loveable - their adventures are both amusing and bewitching.
3,Stick with it and you will be rewarded...,"While there are a million and one coming of age stories out there, this one is woth a look. Although it takes a while to get started from an understandably depressing beginning, it starts to roll when the main character, Lucas, gets into college. Here you actually start to feel attached to the character as you follow him though a series of events, some typical, some out of left field, and some funny, yet all totally believable. The story propels you along at this point, and the next thing you know, 5 chapters have gone by.Rappaport is an accomplished writer, and if you want to experience the hopes and horrors of growing up again - I would recommend ""One Day the Weatherman"".By the way, I would have given it 3 1/2 stars, but Amazon doesn't allow 1/2 stars!"
2,didnt like it,"hey not worth it... cute guys though...!!!!! I thought his narration was good... the movie kinda SUCKED!!! the lead and his best ""straight"" friend is Really HANDSOME!!! Holla!!"
4,Sad Movie- - But GOOD!,Had to watch it several times as the download was interrupted! Enjoyed the movie despite the download problems! Reminded me of a person I once knew many years ago. Film quality and staging was good.
5,"ALL THERE IS, IS LOVE","Not sure the actual BEATLE title. Horrific ending. Not sure I agree with the reviews, but I needed to see this. Thank you."
4,The Book to Pay Attention to,Leaving home was a good book with alot of different stories. To me I think that this book was interesting to read and it makes me want to read more books similar to it. The stories that are in the book all are about leaving home and going on trips and just not being at home. The story that I like the best was Bad Influence because i had to do a presentation on that story. Most of the stories in the book were pretty good. I would reccomened this book to some of my classmates and friends that are in school as well. According to the stories in the book I think that it would be good to leave home and go on a vacation like in the stories.
4,Leaving Home,"I really enjoyed this book. I liked the various authors that were a part of this book. This book opend my eyes to read different authors, I wouldn't normally read. I really enjoyed reading Judith Cofer, and Amy Tan's work. I also enjoyed this book because there are alot of ethnic authors. Some of these authors spoke about their experiences they have endured. The book kept me interested. I would reccomend this book to any of my family or friends."
3,It's a wonderful book,Leaving Home is a wonderful anthology of stories by ddifferent authors who make you feel if your really in the storyin the story.Ireally like reading Allan Sherman AGift Of Laughter because the father and the sonhad similar characteristic.They both reacted in the same way samesame way when they were talk to in a manner that they didn'tdidn't like.In Leaving Home some their decision waseither based on a choice that they had to make ortheir parents sendin them away on vacation.
3,Interesting,"The book consists of several short stories about kids going away from home for the first time. Some of the stories are interesting. One is about a girl who was sent to Puerto Rico to live with her grandparents for the summer. Her experiences give insight to the Puerto Rican culture. An example is how her father drove spirits out of people. With an exception of one or two, the other short stories lack quality."
4,A good pick as a reading book for a freshman,"This book consists of 15 carefully chosen shortstories about people who had to (for some reason)leave home and how they deal with it. Hazel Rochmanand Darlene Z.McCampbell have done a nice job togather this stories form 15 famous authors includingAmy Tan, Tim O'Brien and Toni Morrison( a nobelprise winner and a Princeton University professor).It's an easy read and you won't be sorry of readingit."
4,A Wonderful Book Filled with Short Stories,Leaving Home is a wonderful book filled short stories by different writers. Some of these writers include Sandra Cisneros and Annette Sanford. The stories in this book are about different kinds people that leave their homes or something like that and as they leave they encounter real life problems or realize something in their lives at one point. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys short meaningful stories.
4,so in love....,Leaving Home is a book with different short stories. I read most of them and I think that they were interesting. some stories didn't have the happy endings that i wanted them to have but they are still good endings. two of my favorite were Dawn by Tim Wynne-Jones and On the rainy River by tim O' Brian because in both stories the main characters suffer emotionally and in the end of both storie the endings arent so bad. They were really good to read and understand. I love those kinds of stories. I do recomend this book especially people that like to read short stories instead of the 300 page novels. this is the book to read!
4,Leaving Home review,"I've enjoyed reading this book, not only were the stories short. But they were straight to the point, which is perfect for someone like myself who's not much of a reader."
3,Leaving Home: The Book That Makes You Feel Close To Home.,"This book is a great book to read when you are on a vacation. It makes you sit back and remember bits and pieces of growing up, the good times and the bad. I enjoyed reading this book because it had a numerous amount of authors that gave you a ticket into thier past. Reading this book made me see how much your growing up has to do with you being an adult. So I recommend this book for everyone to read. It will definitely open a door up to your memory."
4,Leaving Home a Fabulas Book,"Leaving home is a fabulas book. I had to read it for my english class, and I am very glad we did. It has alot of great writers in it. The writers are very good and they get their point across very well. In some of the stories I related to some of the characters.I sugest this book to one and all and i hope you all have a great time reading it if you choose."
3,not bad,"i think this book is ok, sometimes i had the empthy of the authors.All the stories are about people leaving home. it's not a bad book after all..."
3,Leaving Home,"The book was very well put together. The stories were very touching, and realistic, they were stories that most readers can relate to. I thought this book was very good."
5,A solidly presented historical account,"Written by Richard S. Lowry (a veteran of the United States Nuclear Submarine Service during the Vietnam War), The Gulf War Chronicles: A Military History Of The First War With Iraq offers a minute-by-minute chronological description of Operation Desert Storm. Drawing upon information, interviews, and diversely informative resources ranging from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August of 1990 to the September 11th attacks upon the United States, The Gulf War Chronicles is a solidly presented historical account and offers great insight into the complex interplay of events upon a world stage -- events that continue to have a reverberating impact in the current global war against international fundamentalist Islamic terrorism."
5,Awesome bibles!!,"I bought these bibles for my daughter's birthdays (age 4 and 5) and they LOVE them! I was wanting a bible with the actual scripture in them (not just a ""story book"") but with a kid friendly look and these bibles are perfect. Because they are so small, the print is very small and kind of hard to read, but overall, we are very pleased with these bibles!"
3,"Sweet, but print TOO SMALL","We ordered this Bible for my 6-year old for Christmas. I have a New Testament NIrV and love the version as it is one that she can actually read and understand. The cover is sweet and the language is perfect for her; but, the print is so small that she can't keep her place when she's reading. I love the way it looks and feels, but we wanted a Bible that she would/could actually read! The print size is definitely a problem for her!"
3,Cute But Not What I Expected,"I bought this because I wanted a bible that was pretty. But I also wanted something that was good for my little girl who is going into [...]. I definitely got a pretty bible. It's pink leather with a purple cross; my [...] daughter loves it. I like that it is in regular book form instead of two columns. But I am slightly disappointed that Jesus' words aren't in read. I am also disappointed that there are no references, concordance, bible dictionary, maps, illustrations or anything child oriented. I don't think it is appropriate for the 6-10 group of girls. It is more for the Pre-teen / Teen group."
3,so so,"As with most art supplies, they have their purpose and will work better for some situations than others. The pencils themselves are very nice. Less blendable than the regular Prismacolor pencils, but they work especially well for detail work.The main reason I'm not overly thrilled with them is they were very difficult to sharpen and quite a few ended up ""shredding"". Big chunks of the sides of the pencil came off and I was using a brand new sharpener, so I don't think that was the problem."
1,"Save your money, don't buy.","I have Prismacolor Premier pencils, love them but these, as several others have said are of poor quality, (crappy) they come unsharpened for a reason, so the wast is on you and not them, the pencil wood splinters and lead breaks off even after you think you've got it. I will continue you buy the Premier pencils but I am switching to Derwent for hard and medium hard pencils, plus they're made in England not Mexico. Very disappointed."
2,well...,Shipping time was nice. It was in plastic so I found it odd that I had two of the same color and missing pink. My favorite color. Should have had two shades of pink and don't have them :( The colors I do have are nice been in school so it took me some time before I could use them.
5,Great colored pencils for outlining and small details,"I usually work in art markers (as opposed to cheapo little kids crafty kinds that is) of various brands, or watercolor, and I like to use colored pencils for my outline - partially because I think it looks nice and partially because my hands suck at inking with a pen. When I found out Prismacolor made their regular pencils in an easily-sharpened-to-a-fine-point variety I just had to get some. I am glad to say I am quite pleased with the result. I will point out I have not yet sharpened and use the entire set, so I may end up editing this review at some point to update on how that goes."
1,"Brittle, poor quality lead","I find it nearly impossible to properly sharpen these pencils. With any mechanical sharpener I use, the leads break during sharpening, always below the wood. The only way I can get any color to draw with is to whittle the end of the pencil with a razor knife, then touch up the tip with fine grit sanding paper. I'm annoyed. Don't buy these. Prismacolor should be embarrassed."
1,splinters and framents,What a disappointment. One pencil arrived in pieces with the lead out of it. And just about every pencil I have sharpened has splintered and fragmented - leaving less than half a pencil. I have tried more than one type of sharpener. Don't buy these or you will be left only with pieces.
3,Disappointing,"Granted, I am not an artist. I'm used to Crayola products and they usually suit me fine. Howver, after reading the reviews I decided to spring for a ""good"" set of pencils. Upon arrival, I was surprised to find that I had to sharpen each of the pencils, which is probably standard for a quality set of pencils, but I simply did not expect it. Not a lot of fun with arthitis and a non-mechanical pencil sharpener, which is all I happened to have available. Unfortunately, it didn't get a lot better. The colors are not as vivid as I expected and don't blend well. I ended up feeling very silly for paying this much money for something that has performed no better than their counterparts costing a quarter (or less) of the price."
1,Certainly not the best set in my life,"I did not like this pencil set at all. The colors are horrible, there is no variety of colors, all of them are dark, blue, green, no bright colors. The quality is not quiet satisfactory as well. I would never buy this set, if I have seen it with my own eyes."
1,Got ripped off,"GOT RIPPED OFF!I don't know what happened with my purchase, but I got 2 ""Orange""s (yes, 2 of the EXACT SAME color. I am sure they're the same because of the serial #). Because I got 2 oranges, I did not get one of the colors I was supposed to get (""Pale Vermilion"").Also, one of my browns had NO LEAD it. It was HOLLOW. The verithins didn't come pre-sharpened, so I did not notice until I tried to sharpen it.Would not buy again. I thought about returning, but figured it wasn't worth paying the shipping cost.It's hard to find verithins that are sold individually, so I can't even replace the mistaken pencils.Be careful when buying."
3,Average,"Cons:I have 130 Prismacolor pencils in a collection box. When I purchase these pencils, I was sad to find out that the colors are not the same. Indigo blue in medium point is a darker color than indigo blue in these pencils (the color number is different, but the color name is the same).Pros: Thin and skinny lines that are good for edges and hard to reach areas.Pros: A clear and almost glassy appearance, which is good for drawing something clear with a tint of color (crystal, glasses, etc.).Pros/Cons: If you want your drawing to look like a drawing and not a painting, then these are good pencils to use. But if you want your drawing to look like a painting or an oil painting, then these pencils will do very little for you. Get the medium point (regular) Prismacolor pencils for a painting look."
2,Verithin are STUDENT GRADE Prismacolors -> cheaper price = lower quality,"Verithin prismacolors are not ""real"" Prismacolor, of which I was unaware. They do not mark with the same vivid color and soft pigment trademark of ""normal"" prismacolor. Buyer BEWARE. You are NOT buying real prismacolors. These mark with the same intensity as Roseart colored pencils. They do NOT blend well. In fact, they don't even match color with ""real"" prismacolor. When you buy Verithin you're getting what you pay for: cheaper quality for a cheaper price. Do not fall for the same ruse that I did. Go the extra $10 and buy the real thing."
1,Very dissapointed.,"I'm not exactly sure why they sell this as a set, I could see a point in getting the white or other brighter colors but these are practically worthless next to the premiere sets. Personally I would have been better off buying some off-brand set that had hard lead, the finished products certainly look that way. I really tried at these but I have given up on ever using these seriously, I regret my purchase so much that I've come here to make a review about how displeased I am."
2,Would have been better off with Crayola,"A waste of $, from the durability side. Cannot sharpen with a mechanical sharpener, which is what we take out for our nature study. Tips keep breaking off repeatedly in any sharpener we use. On the initial sharpening, even the wood shredded. For comparison, the much cheaper Crayolas and Prang do not do this.They draw well, but will look for a different brand in the future."
1,Nothing at all related to Burma,"Purchased this book (which is a reprint of a 1920s book, part of it, and is now public domain) for additional geographical data concerning Burma. It does not depict Burma at all, except in words on top of each page. All the pages are relating to Africa. In fact, reading the introduction, it states Burma was in the book 'Standard III' and this book is 'Standard VI'. Very misleading title for this thin reprint. Author/Amazon should correct the cover of the book - it's not about Burma."
4,"2-Week ""Old Person Pill Organizer""","I call these the old people organizers. It is a little larger that I wanted, and the locking mechanism isn't exactly what I expected, but those are my own impressions. Item received as described, and in good condition. No complaints at all. Thank you."
5,GREAT,Purchased this for my father in law and he truly loves it. The quality was really good. I dont regret it
4,Good pill box for travelers.,"I like that this has enough spots for a week and AM/PM. And if you are a business traveler, the lock will help it from coming open while in your bags."
2,Avoid this design.,"The individual lids will not stay open for filling. I have to use 3 or 4 rubber bands to hold one side's lids to the other sides's lids to fill the compartments. I have a seven day holder and it works just fine, but the 14 day unit is a real pain. After it is filled, it is OK and does not accidentally open during travel."
3,SK,Sally Kirkland I was always attracted to and liked her acting. But like all her films that she gets a starring role. She will take all advantage of it. I get the feeling that she is I am woman hear me roar type. and thats exactly why she ended up doing alot of B films like a Shannon Tweed who I used to really like. The movie is defintely not American. I find the european film makers can be aloof in their ideas. Like they are missing a few screws. Even the good ones you watchin a Fellini film and your like what the ?
5,Love this movie,"I absolutly love this movie. Sally Kirkland did indeed deserve the highest honors for this on target performance. This movie flowed and I can watch it again and again. I cannot convey how much not only do I love the movie, but how I felt the emotions throughout.I am thrilled to see it now on DVD - a must have."
4,Quite a Good Book,"An excellent book, less because of the plot (limited compared with Kidnapped) but more because of the bits of wisdom so typical of RLS. He had a dry sense of humor and a very sharp eye (much like Dickens) and his writings are filled with his take on the local color. And with the much bigger picture of life itself.Anyway, I very much did like David Balfour, and I am glad I read it."
3,To Catch or Not To Catch?,"These are some reasons you should read Henry and Ribsy. First, it is funny when Ramona wants to eat P.T.A,because you can't eat P.T.A. Second, its exciting when he tries to keep Ribsy out of trouble to go fishing. If he does go fishing you'll ask will he catch or not catch. So read Henry and Ribsy!"
3,Horrible Harry and the Ant Invasion,I give this book three stars because you enjoy it when you read it but it is not a book that deserves five stars.I recomend this book to somebody because sometimes you get board reading the same book there are four stories in this book and they are interesting because they have many details about the characters and when things happen that have to do something with them you wont think it is wierd.
1,"Never worked, not even once","Given the high price of these batteries, I was really hoping this charger would work. Unfortunately, it never did... not even once. Amazon should consider removing this product."
3,Recharble 2CR5 juice camera battery kit.,I have two film cameras that use the 2CR5 camera battery. One is a Minolta Maxxum 3000i the other is a Canon EOS 10. The juice rechargeable battery works fine in the Minolta but will not operate in the Canon. It has enough power to operate the Canon's focus motor and shutter but not enough to run the wind motor. Please don't take this as preaching but I have had this problem with other rechargeable camera batteries also. They can make the volts but most fall short in making the amps. If you are a pro you better stick with the Lithium 2CR5 and even then take a couple of new ones along on your assignment. Put tape over the contacts if you take them in your pocket. I had one burn a hole in my leg when it got against a quarter.
1,ripoff,"Believe the negative reviews. Battery doesn't even charge. I can't believe that a) I ignored them, thinking they couldn't possibly have NOT fixed the problem, or b) that they've been allowed to keep selling a scam for $30...wtf?"
5,It's the one to watch!,"The Old Kai's Weapon - Gohan struggles against Buu. Old Kai decides to give his life to Goku so Goku can return to fight Buu. Then Old Kai gives Goku two earrings that will allow Goku and Gohan to instantly fuse. Supreme Kai and Kibito fuse in this way. Elsewhere, Baba and King Yemma are resurrecting Vegeta.Ready to Fuse? - Tien arrives and is quickly beaten. Goku returns and splits Buu in two. Goku tries to use the earrings to permanently fuse with Gohan, but Gohan drops the earring, and while they're looking for it Gotenks defuses, making Buu revert. Goku opts not to fuse with Gohan. Then Buu absorbs Gohan, becoming even stronger. Goku looks for someone to fuse with.Union of Rivals - Vegeta and Goku both struggle against Buu and don't have a chance. Goku tries to persuade Vegeta to permanently fuse with him via the earrings. Finally, after learning the Buu ate Bulma, Vegeta agrees and Vegetto is formed."
1,no good,i was expecting the item and i waited for this to come and it didnt arive so i contacted them and they refunded my money all goodbut wile i was waiting for the new blades i didnt buy one for the saw i use every day as i thought it wont be long now and they will arive but they didnt and the blade got worse and worse and the damage i have done to the saw wasnt good it went back to be repaired [i know its my fult useing a blunt blade but if you say you are sending something then send it dont waste my timeso for a refund 5 stars for the product 0 stars but i have to give 1
5,Great blade for a sliding compound miter saw,"Completely impressed with this blade. It mates up well with my Milwaukee 12"" sliding compound miter saw. An important performance feature is the 5 degree negative hook, which is in the range recommended by Milwaukee for sliding compound. Add the other features of this blade and you get a great performer."
1,"Blade is not actually 12"" in diameter","I ordered this blade expecting it to fit on my miter saw just as my other 12"" blades did. Unfortunately, the manufacturer decided that 1/4"" smaller in diameter was acceptable. It isn't, as it won't even cut through the wood fully. When measured against all other 12"" blades I own, this one is 11 3/4"" in diameter, where all others are precisely 12"".Freud blades are awesome, and I'll buy them whenever I can. This is one instance where I wish I hadn't wasted my time. If you sell a 12"" blade, make sure it is actually 12"" in diameter."
5,Love this pump!,Have tried many different pumps and this one is the keeper! We use this to blow up large inflatable pools for the kids and with my previous pump took 1.5 hours and this pump took me 10 minutes. My parents bought it first and I loved it so much I bought one for myself!
2,Not as much air as I expected....,"I bought this to inflate my Intex Mariner 400 instead of using the hand pump that came with it. With the hand pump, it takes me somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes to inflate the boat. With this pump, it takes over 15 minutes. This in itself makes it a pointless purchase for me. Maybe I should have done a little more research but I would expect an electric pump to work a little faster than I do."
5,Was what I had remembered,Read this version in about 8 hours. Interesting update from the original version.Also got large text for my little eyes
2,"Great ideas, bad execution","This e-book had great potential but the emphasis on the main character and the way he wastes his life by using the belt to please himself really made me not enjoy this book enough to like it, so I asked for a refund after reading it. I believe ghe author overemphasizes sex and narcissism in a way that makes time-traveling boring. The good thing about the book is that he discusses causality and the consequences of time-traveling in a very unique way, so this is probably why so many people like it.Note: this book was written in the seventies but was updated in 2005 so it talks about things that happened after it was first published."
5,Fantastic Time Travel story!,I read this book in High School about 16 years ago and it was one of those mind blowing books that change you a little. Loved it and have been looking for a printed copy since then!! My kindle will be arriving tomorrow and I will def be ordering this to read it again!
3,"A new meaning for ""self-discovery""","This book provides a fascinating look at the nature of time and the possibility of time travel. The concept of infinitely branching time streams helps to resolve the apparent paradoxes of time travel, and creates some mind boggling-possibilities. The descriptions of time travel and the fabric of time are probably the greatest strengths of this book.Unfortunately, rather than use time travel as a tool to explore history or to improve the human condition, the main character turns inward. His relationships with the other time travelling versions of himself bring a whole new meaning to narcissism. This extreme level of self-centeredness is unattractive and it was difficult to feel sympathetic towards him. This concept of time travel had great potential, but the selfishness of the main character weakens the story. Also, the sexual content of this story definitely makes this a book for a mature reader, and might be offensive to some readers."
1,A plodding mess,"I picked this up and saw that it was deemed a classic and gave it a shot... it just plodded along and when it got to the point where he started making out with himself I closed the cover, walked into the garage and tossed it into the recyclable container... this dude wrote about tribbles 45 years ago and is still living off of that."
3,A disappointment.,"I love time-travel books, but this one was very disappointing. I never felt that if I had received a time-belt I would do any of the things that Daniel did. Instead of exploring history, he was more interested in exploring other versions of himself. I didn't like the sexual parts and I didn't like Daniel at all."
1,Don't listen to recommendations,"A science fiction author (I'll be kind and leave his name out of this) recommended this book as one to read if you're interested in time travel.Not only is there little plot, but that smattering only touches on actual time travel, mostly giving a long list of the main character's destinations, instead of what he found there or the complications of. Though the author's time travel theory interests momentarily, his ventures into homosexuality obviously intrigue him more than a time travel plot; at the introduction of a female version of himself, the book loses all cohesiveness.The ""plot"" reads more like an unscored ping pong game, a great disappointment, considering how much I enjoy the author who recommended this book."
1,a boring novel,"This book is about a man who travels back and forth in time to meet himself in various situations. It reaches a point where you the reader can predict what will happen in the scenes and that's never a good sign. Honestly there really isn't much more to it than that and it's easily apparent that it's a cliched plot if you are a well read science fiction reader. And that is never a good sign. Oh there are so many better time travel stories out there, in this readers opinion, (I've been reading sf for 30 years now! I read at least 10 sf novels a month). This is just not worth wasting your time on.Try the ever successful and enjoyable 'The Time Traveler's Wife' which features some real human pathos and excitement in the time travel tale."
1,Hated it!,This book was stupid in my opinion. All it was about really was him making duplicates of himself and **spoilers** having orgies with his alternate selves. I didn't even finish reading it. It was awful.
1,A long desultory essay rather than a story,"I picked up the Kindle version after reading the preface by Robert Sawyer and the lead in pages. Unfortunately, this is not really a novel or story with characters and plot. Rather, there are a series of vignettes that are filled with pages of what ifs. One can discuss paradoxes and potential scenarios all you want, but these are all fluff since time travel is purely imaginary. One should take this plot tool and build a story. This is not what happens. For instance, he discusses kidnapping baby Hitler but finding that the world in the 1960s was screwed up because of some unspecified paradoxes. He then states that he put the infant back and allowed his assasination by German generals in 1939. Things turned out better. Think twice if you you would like a engaging time travel story. Better yet, pick up Ken Grimwood's book."
2,Highly overrated,"While I can't say that I didn't like this book at all, I can say that it was hardly a work of literary genius. The writing style is a bit prosaic, and the dearth of true character interaction quickly becomes obnoxious. But the most frustrating thing about it is that it could have been so much more. The author raises would-be fascinating scenarios regarding paradoxes and the effects of removing key historical figures from existence, but never gives any of these topics more than a perfunctory once-over. The beginning of the book misleads the reader into believing that a detailed examination of the nuances and dangers of time travel will follow, but disappoints them when these issues are never fully explored - or explained for that matter.I did like the fact that the author presented a couple of possibilities that I had never considered, which made for good conversation topics. However this is less a story about time travel than one of trite self-examination and sexual exploration."
3,"Interesting sci-fi premise, but ultimately disappointing","**** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ****I set out liking this story immediately after reading it, but have since soured to it.This idea of having sex with yourself is really original, and probably ground breaking in 1973, but I can't help but feel the author is being hypocritical in his description of it. In the afterword, he himself describes how it was difficult for him to write the gay love-making scene. What strikes me is the fact that the physical act of sex is glossed over. Until we get to the hetereosexual love-making scene; there we get vivid descriptions of penetration, that are conspicuously lacking from the homosexual love-making scene.It's really jarring to compare those scenes, and it makes you think he censored himself, which is off-putting.A shame, for a good premise.(edit: this review concerns the Kindle-edition; I'm not sure why it says hardcover)"
2,A somewhat misleading title...don't read it to your kids!,"I enjoyed the beginning of the story and the exploration of some of the paradoxical theories of time travel. However, the story did slowly move into a somewhat exhausting examination of gay love between oneself and others....ummmmm, not really what I had in mind. To be fair, our hero does swing over to the other ""team"" for awhile. I guess for the bi-sexual time-travelers out there it's a treat. For the rest of us, well.....let's just say the marketing surrounding this book is very well-done...pass."
2,Couldn't get started.,"Sorry, but I couldn't get into this book. I tried several times and it just didn't work for me. Maybe it is just me, I never could get into the Trilogy of the Rings ether."
3,"Ok, not terrible, not great.","mediocre: I had some hopes for this book but it didn't exactly live up to them. It wasn't bad; there were several parts I did enjoy. Not one i would read again, but not bad. There were too many plot holes but it did have some interesting philosophical ideas."
2,The Man Who Folded ... and Adored ... Himself,"Danny inherits a special belt from his Uncle. This magical belt allows him to travel through time. The result: many various creations of himself, each traveling through a different facet of time. This presents him with an unusual proposition, to meet and love 'himselves' in a very personal manner. What an awesome idea for a plot! Sadly, the momentum of the story was lost. The original impetus was neglected and replaced by self-adoration. The plot had been sacrificed for some other goal, promotion of self-absorption and narcissism. I found this book to be very disappointing."
4,All paradox of time travel covered here!,"Everytime time travel is covered there is always some paradox that is glossed over. Some short cut. If this book took out the short cut, there wouldn't be a book. It's cover-to-cover time paradox(s). An absolute must own for anyone interested in time travel or conversing on the subject.Michael Gree"
2,What's up with the sex?,"This book had a fascinating premise and some pretty neat twists and concepts. However, it was pretty much ruined by the inclusion of sex, both gay and straight. Now, I have nothing against sex or depictions of it (in either film or literature), but it just felt so wrong here. I expected a science fiction story and instead I got soft core porn."
2,A bit too bizarre for me!,"This was my first experience reading this type of book. I have always been a mystery reader but my husband read It and suggested I give it a shot. A bit too ""out of the realm"" for my liking but persevered to the end.Why not? It was a new experience!"
2,BIG disappointment,"The original premise of the book was great. Another time travel book.Unfortunately, once you get toward the end of the book, the story really degrades. I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that as far as I was concerned, the ending of the book had zero to do with the build up of the book to that point."
4,A journal through time,"I think narcissism and time travel go hand in hand. Dan/Don/Danny/Diane et al is not much different than Dave Lister. I enjoyed the book quite a bit, though I have to wonder if the author retconned some of Dan's early stock picks. The original book was published in 1973, so unless the author has a time belt of his own or is psychic, he wouldn't have known about Apple and Sony. I'd love to get a first edition and compare those passages... The time travel plot and ""twists"" are fairly standard, the ending didn't suprise me but I did enjoy this telling of the story. The journal entries from the various incarnations allowed for a character growth that doesn't usually happen in this genre of book. I also liked the rather frank exploration of the main character's sexuality."
4,The Man Who Folded Himself,This was a really satisfying time travel novel. Beautiful circularity that showed a lot of research and thought on the subject.
1,"""The Man Who Fondled Himself,"" more like","Potential paradoxes be damned, I wouldn't mind going back in time a few weeks and spending my $13.95 on something else. The protagonist behaves like a particularly annoying adolescent and seems to get little out of his travels through the decades and centuries other than endless onanistic booty calls. Compiling a two-and-a-half-page list of pivotal historical events prefaced by ""I saw"" and ""I was there for"" is unfathomably lazy and does an extreme disservice to the potential of the setup. And had H.G. Wells read ""The Man Who Folded Himself"" and ""The Time Traveler's Wife,"" he would scramble to use the timebelt to excise from his memory the fact that modern-day authors seem to find the best use of limitless chronological possibilities is to have sex with one's self. It all devolves into a bleak ""Outer Limits"" scenario that would be depressing were the book and its characters capable of engendering anything more than apathy."
4,early Larry Cordle,"This album, I believe, is not available new, but contains a Larry Cordle song called ""Bandit"" that is a very popular song at his live performances and amoung coon hunters. Larry now fronts this band and this CD is great bluegrass. Country fans will know Larry Cordle as the writer of ""Murder on Music Row"" from a few years back ........"
1,Disappointing,"We received our fondue pot today, and made it through our cheese course - the crock worked great. However, we got halfway through the meat, and the heating unit shut off. We verified that the power cord was securely attached and waited approx 30 minutes. The heating unit never came back on.Also, like other reviewers mentioned, the sticker on the heating unit is very difficult to remove, and we did experience the burning plastic smell.Very disappointed, and are requesting a refund. We'll keep shopping for a fondue pot."
3,could be better,"I asked for this fondue pot as a gift because I really wanted the double boiler piece and the electric capability at the tabletop. Those pieces are definitely there, and so far it has worked great for cheese and chocolate, but I haven't been able to get it to a high enough temperature for broth (I haven't tried oil yet). Not happy about that. My husband gave up last time we tried broth b/c it was taking far too long to cook our food. He ended up just sauteeing his portion of dinner on the stove. If I were to do it over, I'd probably get a different model."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"While the price was good and the product does indeed work, the power cord (which attaches magnetically) detaches very easily, making it something of a pain when you have a group over to share. While this is a relatively minor issue it's definitely worth noting, as it can be quite an annoyance."
3,entry level fondue,"This is a nice set, it feels slightly light-weight but definitely capable of boiling water (haven't tried broth yet) and melting chocolate or cheese so it isn't entirely necessary to prepare your fondue on the stove first. The pot doesn't completely cover the burner but it still feels secure- overall its a nice piece and definitely gets the job done. I think if we end up eating this way quite often a larger, more solid product will be necessary but for random fun with chocolate etc. its great!"
5,Love It,"After reading many reviews and speculating on which brand would be the best, we decided to purchase the Trudeau and we absolutely love the versatility between the metal and cermaic pot. Most other brands do not offer the two different types of pots - it's either one or the other. Trudeau offers all in one - very smart purchase for all types of fondue."
4,Fondue,"This is the only electic fondue pot I've found sized for two people. I like the way the base is a hotplate so you can submerse the bowl when you wash it. Has a ceramic insert for cheese and chocolate so its a double boiler. Have only used it for deep fry oil so far, heated fairly quick. Maintained temp pretty good. Over all looks good, seems well made and I'm happy so far. Cheese fondue is next."
4,Efficient fondue pot,"We've had fondue pots for many years- electric and non-electric. The great advantage of the electric pots is that you don't have to mess with paint thinners or gels for heat; you just plug it the electric pot in and it works fine. This particular arrangement not only allows you to do meat fondue but has an inner, removable ceramic insert that allow you to do cheese. This works fine for both meat and cheese. The only minor complaint I might have is that the cheese and meat are somewhat less warm to the taste than the arrangement done with gels and paint thinners. The meat is a bit rarer and not as well cooked but perfectly fine. The meat heated with paint thinner can get to be somewhat more well done-- and even charred a bit-- which I like. But- this electric set up is fine. The pot can be put in a dishwasher and is unbeatable for convenience."
4,Works just as it should,"It does just what a fondue pot should. It gets hot and melts stuff. We've used this several times for full meals and just for dessert. Easy to use, easy to clean."
1,Heating element failed the 2nd time we used it,"I was excited to order an electric fondue pot because I expected we would be able to control the temperature and get the broth or oil good and hot. It worked perfectly the first time we used it, even though the connection between the power cord and the heating element is of poor design (magnets rather than a solid plug connection). But the very next night we wanted to use up the leftovers, and after about 10 minutes the heating element just stopped working. Kaputt, dead, nothing doing. And it's no longer under warranty because I waited a full year after purchasing it to organize a fondue party. Very disappointing."
1,If I could I would give it 0 stars,This product is worthless!They place the sticker on the heating element.Enjoy a horrible smell every time you start it up.My advice: Use a mini crockpot.
2,Not hot enough,"This set cannot get the oil up to 375 degrees (the proper temp with peanut oil) and is too underpowered to hold it anywhere near that temperature, so you have to stop every few groups of items to let the oil heat up again. I guess you need to heat the oil on the stove and then (carefully!!) bring it over to the heating unit. Make sure you have a good thermometer to check the oil temp.Dinner took 90 minutes and that was basically giving up because we were so bored at that point.So, fine for cheese fondue, but not for hot oil."
1,I bought three of these and all three were defective,"I just wanted to alert potential Brikka buyers that there may be several batches of defective Brikkas floating around on the market. So far I've gone through three of them and all three were defective -- very poorly machined, sharp jagged edges, gaskets that don't fit, loose safety valves, flakes of metal floating in the brewed coffee (not good!), etc. Maybe I'll try again at some point in the future once the defective batches have disappeared. Hopefully Bialetti's quality control will improve by then.On the bright side, Amazon makes it very easy to return defective merchandise. Kudos for that."
2,"Cool, but very poor quality","I love making coffee using this device, but it is an extremely poor quality. All handles are always broken with no option to replace them. You have to replace the gasket every month just to make it works fine. Bialetti uses the third party support service, so you would hardly receive any quality help. I just give up from this morning headache and start using classic Turkish Pot."
1,Sent it back,"Just wasn't as easy to use and had some problems with it. The company did quickly exchange the first one, but it did not really work with my Sony cameras. (Then again the Sony monitor had a similar problem with my HX100v) and it was bulky for using with my point and shoot. It weighted a lot with the battery I picked up for it."
1,Not worth the money,This is just a toy. The screen resolution is so bad I would not even trust it to check focus. It was constantly having trouble connecting with my camera. It felt plastic and cheep. I boxed it up and returned it after 3 hours of owning it.
3,A decent album if you like variety of styles including hip-hop,"I am a huge fan of the previous Troublemakers album - Doubts and Convictions. However this album is quite a departure from this style. Most notably, almost half of this album contains rap / hip-hop style tracks.If you are receptive to hip hop and rap you will like this album. If you are like me, and can't stand it, you may be disappointed."
3,Was the point missed?,"Half way through I started to lose interest. I have an opinion about capital punishment, and John Grisham caused me to examine it more closely. However, the point to me was not whether or not it is it right, but why does it take so long to carry our these sentences? I suspect his motivation for writing this book may lie, in part, in an attempt to sway the reader to his thinking. The book drags for the last half, and I wasn't swayed."
2,A Bit Heavy...,"If you have fine, rather thin hair don't buy this. It will just weigh your hair down and take out the curl rather than ""define"" it. It does smell lovely though."
5,Curl saver,"This product is exactly as hyped-really great for curly hair, not sticky, not stiff just holds curls naturally. I'm now addicted!"
2,Too superficial and vague,Nothing new to learn. The producers of this series have done better videos than this one.Look for other than this one.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book after reading the previous reviews. I was really looking forward to reading it with my son. We will travel to Ireland, this summer, and I wanted to get a book so that both of us could learn something about the history and culture of Ireland. While the book is very colorful, both my son and I found it utterly confusing and disjointed. I am honestly disappointed with the purchase."
3,Decent product,"This will work with the ZX2 Cool Coupe (takes minor changes for the mounting) all my controls work great. Nice to have them back after 3 months without.Only complaint is the rear defrost indicator light does not work, may have been wired wrong but i do not think so."
4,not a good fit,"i would like to know why the kit is not clicking into my dash. its very annoying when my kit keeps sliding out, can someone please help!"
2,Not very good,This item is pretty cheap. Most of the lights for the bottom portion didn't work and it didn't fit very well and kept falling out. Talk about annoying and dangerous as you are cruising down the road. One positive is that the wiring is basically plug and play and gets you past trying to figure our ford's impossible wiring. This one positive is enough to not give it one star.
3,Bad Fit,"Great quality but was a nightmare to install on 1999 Ford Escort becase the AC, Heater, Fan, controls are on the same face plate. After finally working on and off with it because of siffness I'm 66 years old and must have installed a dozen radios in all types of cars but never again in a ford or mercury and I guess the Ford tarus is the same, better off letting BB intall it and pay thought the nose approx. 300.00 or so because of labor and parts, It ran me about 150.00 counting the radio and face plate, Amazon had a great price on the faceplate 36.00 or compared to 70.00 or at you know where! The one negative thing is the faceplate could have been an eigth of an inch bigger, it had to be clued in, kept slipping out when you would it a bad road of bump, yep nowhere to screw or attach."
2,Average quality towel with iron-on sport's emblem,The towel looks much nicer in the picture than it actually is. I made the mistake of assuming the U Miami emblem was either embroidered or sewn on. It is NOT. The decal is simply an iron on that will likely wash off. Very disappointed. I wish I had know this prior to purchase.
1,"beware, buyer","This is the first review I ever share on Amazon. I tend to keep my thoughts to myself, but this book is more a pamphlet that leads to their service advertisements. I think someone must bring this ""scam"" to light. (Please check the number of pages in this ""book"", then divide by 4 to get the equivalent pages of a book)The 4 items that this book covers are common sense that any experienced investor and intermediate trader would have developed in the first 3 years at the respective area.Use the cost of this book and buy a deep out of money contract. It will be more profitable."
1,Save Your Time and Money--This Book is Worthless...,"This is a brief and shallow book. It assumes that the reader, who is an options trader, has limited intelligence and will do stupid things. The best thing about the book is that it is short; therefore, you can quickly find that it has nothing to offer. ..."
4,Good but brief,"This is a good book, though a bit pricey for a book that can be read in less than 1 hour.In it the author describes the biggest mistakes option traders make which are: ignoring implied volatility, making long-shot bets with options, using strategies that are too complex (for you), and trading illiquid options.Material is good, with a chart of which strategies work the best for varios levels of implied volatility and other gems, but it's debatable if this book is worth its hefty price tag."
5,Excellent book but could be enhanced,"This book is excellent for beginning options traders. You can save yourself a lot of losses and headaches by following the authors advice. Even though this book is small, it is concise, powerful and very understandable. The only reservation I have is the lack of real life examples on how to apply the concepts profitably.On a friend's recommendation I recently picked up the book ""Generate thousands in cash on your stocks without selling them"" which gives real examples on how to use options in combination with stock trades to enhance profits. These books together in my opinion form a powerful combination."
4,Faithfully puts my son to sleep,"Though I'm not a country music fan, I enjoy listening to this CD, too. It's very soothing, and the songs are hearfelt with some truly precious lines. ""Green-pea toes"" comes to mind, along with ""today you have the hands of a baby, tomorrow the hands of a lady."""
5,Our Little Buckeroo likes it,We've listened to it almost every night for the last seven weeks and we still like it along with our new little one. We're going to give to to several of our friends who are having or about to have children.
5,Beautiful CD,"This CD was our favorite when our son was a baby, and now we've purchased it for a friend's newborn. It came quick, well packaged, sealed, and perfect as expected. Thank you."
1,Not What I was expecting,"I was looking forward to giving this to my husband for his first Fathers Day and was expecting sweet mellow lullabies, I had to take it out of CD player after the 3rd song. We were extremely disappointed in this purchase"
1,An old book for new money,"I bought this book for my wife. It turns out she already has it. But when it arrives, I opened a well worn book that was not what I expected. I want to return the book but it is impossible so far to contact the selling company. I want to get their return address and return the book. It looks very daunting at this point.Gordon Ramsay: Chef For All SeasonsI am very dissapointed.Richard Hotard"
2,"Boring, don't bother","I have read a lot of books by Ostrander and Duursema. In this book the artist is different and Ostrander has help from other authors. And that is the problem. I found this book to be incredibly tedious, partly from the fact is is written in flashback mode. And the art is not as good as Duursema'sI gave this 2 stars instead of 1, because there is some character backgrounding of notable Jedi and soon to be CIS/Imperial characters, Though its not developed enough to really give you any insight. It's almost like cameos."
1,Ugly Addition to Any Bathroom,"I bought this because my parents have a nice brushed-silver toilet roll holder. Not the same as this but I couldn't find theirs online. So I ordered this. It's hideous whether loaded with toilet paper or not. When stacked to the top with toilet paper, it looks somewhat obscene. You'll have to trust me on that. These things can be done tastefully, but this particular one is not designed well."
4,Very Stylish & Great Value,I have one of these in both of my bathrooms. They are great value for money and are so stylish and contemporary. I love them and visitors often comment on how unusual they are. They do start to develop some rust spots after about 12 to 18 mths but these come off quiet easily with some regular household cleaner and a scourer which makes them look like new again.
2,problem,"ok, it is well made and sturdy, and it is a handy way to store toilet paper. Also, it looks good- without toilet paper on it. However, because of its design, with toilet paper on it it looks like a mess. The roll closest to the floor will always be twisted to the side. I guess I was hoping for it not only to keep the bathroom organized but to look good at the same time."
4,"Not my style, but good quality","I ordered three pairs of orange tinted safety glasses from three different sellers and the Remington ones were pretty good. The style was not quite what I was expecting, but they are great for riding my road bike. I liked the Nemesis ones the best for style and quality."
5,shooting glasses,I do not use these for shooting glasses. I use these for safety glasses when soldering or around the shop they fit great and has never fogged up when wearing them. I have nothing bad to say about these glasses would buy again I think they were worth the money.
2,"Believe me, they fog up.","I was using this pair in an indoor range and 5 mins into it, they started fogging up. I know they are cheap but get a better pair because believe me they fog up."
5,Work well,I am happy with these. I use them shooting my AR-15 at an indoor range. Had trouple with my other glasses foggin up. These I have not had that problem with. I will likely get another pair to have a backup set. Good price not a steal of a deal but fair price.
2,Cheap sunglasses,"I bought these shooting glasses about a month ago. They look nice, they fit well for a small face. But, They aren't very good for shooting.The angled lens distorts the view, especially looking through a scope. Maybe it is the cheap plastics lens having parallax.I recommend looking for better shooting eye wear. I currently am using my Oakleys', they work great, but costly."
1,Junk....keep looking.,"Blurry, blurry, & blurry. The 2nd most important thing after eye protection is visibility!! Right out of the package very blurry, and I want to clearly see what I am about to shoot. I'm not even going to bother reviewing any other things about these glasses as what's the point if they are not clear?? Maybe I got a bad pair but not going to waist more time & money to try again. Maybe a different brand for a couple more bucks will be an improvement. Guess they would be good for you, if your interested in shooting things with a 1/2 awake 2am view..."
3,Fit is great but no cloth case...,The fit on these is great but there is no way to store them for travel. Every other pair I have ever bought at this price point comes with a cloth bag. I could easily move this review up if there was a bag.
2,Shoot to heal,"Came already damaged during shipment. Quality overall-not good, decided not to exchange.Plastic made in China, still price is too hight for that particular product.Thank you."
3,"Decent glasses for the price, but not road worthy","I bought these glasses as a cheap way to protect my eyes while riding my bike or ATV. They work, but aren't a very good choice for long-term use because they are a bit blurry and give me a major headache after having them on for longer than 15-20 minutes."
2,So it IS possible to not like shooting glasses!,"These look neat, but they fit tightly enough to my face that they fog up when I'm trying to shoot. Fundamental expectation of glasses: to be able to see out of them. Fundamental expectation of shooting glasses (this is a big one): being able to see out of them while shooting a gun.Ventilation or some sort of texture on the frame would undoubtedly help."
2,not an anti fog lens,the style and fitting of the glasses are great but one thing for sure its not an anti fog because everytym a sweat the lenses got foggy so i have to wipe it out to get clearer vision
5,Safety Glasses,"I like the shooting glasses even though I didn't get them for shooting. I just got them for eye protection because in my workshop things are flying everywhere, and it's a hazard to eyes. I like them especially because I can adjust the nose pads, which is a eye saver for those with no bridge on the nose."
2,Weak ear arms,After only a few uses with earmuffs the ear arm broke. The ear piece is soft rubber that is bonded to a hard plastic arm. The idea is to make the glasses more comfortable; and it is more comfortable.Unfortunately it also makes them weak. The rubber end fell off after only a few uses making the glasses useless.I guess if you always put the earmuffs on after the glasses are on and then remove the the muffs every time you need to take the glasses off then they'd hold up. But if you forget and grab the glass and pull the rubber end will get yanked off. It only takes a few times before they fail.
2,Pinches the nose.,"Got the glasses for riding in the dark hours and shooting indoor range. The nose piece is hard, not soft. If you wear it for a long period of time the nose piece start to dig into your nose and makes the ride or shooting thinking about making adjustment instead of the adventure."
5,Sharp,"What can I say? They work well, sharp images and comfortable to wear. I use these at target practice, skiing, etc.."
5,Remington glasses,"Cool looking and other wise safe. Always put your ears and eyes on when shooting! Safety first alway, no exception."
3,"They fit, they cover my peripheral vision.",I was hoping these would be a bit darker so i could also use them as sun shades as well but as it is they are great for spotting. The world tunes up to a bright blue and once you get used to them everything is crisp within view. I like them better than yellow or amber for clarity.
4,"Not perfect, but unbeatable value for the price","These are not high-end, vision enhancing, perfectly fitted, super-low profile shooting glasses. But they are very inexpensive, reliable, non-fogging, non-distorting, clear protective glasses. They do have less coverage compared to other more fully protective glasses, but this is also why they do not fog up. I wear these glasses inside a muggy indoor shooting range. I come out of there drenched in sweat, but after a number of 1hour+ plinking sessions, I still have yet to have these fog up on me. Some reviews have said these glasses don't fit well under earmuffs, but I haven't found that to be the case. Then again, I have a fairly wide head (so these glasses don't bulge very far outward).For the bottom dollar price, you'll be hard pressed to find a better alternative. Spend 3x-4x what you're paying for these glasses ($20+) and you'll start finding sharper alternatives. Pretty impressive for $5."
3,feels like there's a grade,"quality is good for the price, but when you wear it, it feels like you're wearing graded glasses. i don't mind shelling out a few bucks more to get decent ones."
5,"Pretty comfortable, very good glasses","I bought these the other day, got them super quick and was pumped to try them out the next day. I didn't buy them to be primarily shooting glasses, but they work great as those. I used them as regular old-sunglasses the first day and they were great. They're pretty comfortable, look really good (I got a few compliments on them) and I love them. I'm most likely going to buy another pair or 2 in the near future. Great glasses, and for the money you can't go wrong."
5,nice glasses,"i like the look of the design. feels very comfortable. does not come with case, it would have been nice. have not use these yet so I don't know how the sunlight will effect my view. its meant for indoor use i believe."
4,Great for bike riding/cycling,"I bought these because I saw on a blog that they were great for blocking wind when cycling. I usually commute to work on bike in windy conditions so my eyes were getting really dry and irritated, this is a great solution.They seem to be good quality, they have the wrap around style that I needed and have rubber pieces in the middle so they are really comfortable.They obviously don't block out wind completely (they weren't deigned for this) but they do the job quite well for the price."
5,Amazing safety glasses,"These glasses are just amazing. They are very comftorable, and they are very clear. It feels like you aren't wearing any glasses whatsoever. If you are looking for safety glasses, you can't get much better than this."
5,Remington Shooting Glasses,"These glasses are great anti fog glasses that are very reasonably priced. I highly recommend them for what they are advertised as, but also riding at night."
4,Good design,Great design. holds well to you head and provides a great area of protection around the face. not keen on the amber lens though. just get clear.
1,Not good for indoors,They get foggy almost immediatly cant really do anything but keep taking them off and wipnig them every 40 secI do not recommend this product save your money and buy some other ones
2,Cheap,"Well of course I purchased this eye pro because it was cheap. And well, thats exactly what is is... CHEAP. Scratches easily."
5,good price good quality!!!,"4 days ago I got my Remington T-72 glasses(smoke lens). At first I thought cheap price goggle would hurt my eyes but when I tried it on, it feels comfortable when wear them at the ranged. Now I even use it as a sun glasses to go to the beach, fishing, etc... I would recommend this product to people who enjoy going to the ranged, hunters, fisherman, and anyone who like to do outdoor activities."
3,Glasses they are good,they are light weight and fit good... I would buy more... they are a good buy... nothing to brag about though...
5,excellent for both the firing range and for mowing!,"I bought the Remington T-72 in both the Smoke Lens and the Clear Lens for several purposes including mowing the yard and using the weed whacker. These glasses wrap around making them superb ""safety"" glasses.. better than most true safety glasses I have owned through the years. They are also excellent for eye protection when traipsing through the woods as part of Wilderness Search and Rescue (SAR) teams!"
3,Average,"They get the job done. Not much else to say with regards to this product. Not great, not bad - just your average pair of vision protection glasses."
3,Not designed for use with ear protection.,Nice glasses but not very comfortable with ear protection. The side frames are contoured so they stick out from the head. They should be a flatter profile so ear protection doesn't put so much pressure on them.
4,good protection,These work great and clear view.They do not work well with ear muffs as they push the muffs away from head allowing noise to enter
5,perfect for cycling,"I've been using these ""shooting"" glasses as my primary cycling sunglasses, and they've been the best. I typically cycle over 100 miles per week, and also wear these glasses during races.Good quality lens with no distortion, and the wrap around design blocks wind very well -- as a contact lens wearer, my eyes are *very* sensitive to dust and wind."
4,Feels Cheap but Great Value,"As the title says, you do get what you pay for but a little more.For the price you pay, you can't have it all but these come very close. Good for Airsofters on a budget, these glasses will get you through any game with little problem. A required piece of gear, a standard piece of gear, an affordable piece of gear.Only con is that they do feel... ""cheap."" Only when you hold them, though. When they are being worn you won't notice the feel and the nose piece is very comfortable and will keep them on your face easily."
3,Remington T-72 Shooting Glasses,"I like the way they wrap around and fully cover my eyes, even over my glasses. For some reason they produce glare spots,which can be distracting when aiming."
5,Cheap and durable enough,"I wish they shipped with a case as I tend to just through it them at the bottom of my range bag, but so far they are scratch free and clear. Comfortable enough to wear for a few hours of shooting and I can wear them under my earmuffs just fine. And really for the price the are practically disposable. I'll probably pick a few back up pairs."
3,La Dama del Alba was fine for educational purposes.,"While LA DAMA DEL ALBA wasn't the most interesting book I've read in Spanish, it is a fine educational tool, and it is an ideal summer reading choice for those students entering Spanish IV or Spanish V. While the plot is a little lax, there are excellent examples of the irregularities in Spanish grammar, and exposes students and readers to the elements needed to comprehend a work of literature written in the Spanish language."
4,La dama del alba,"Good and spooky story, stimulating the mind to learn Spanish effectively. I enjoyed reading it along with my Spanish class."
5,A must-have for Hawaii backpackers.,"Anyone thinking of overnight stays in the Hawaii backcountry should have this book. In it is info about getting to the trailhead, negotiating the trail itself, and more. I've used it for trips across Haleakala, to Halape, and up Mauna Loa. Don't leave home without it. [g]"
3,"Describes only couple trails, no general info.","If you're not planning to exactly follow one of the described trails, it's useless. Does not contain any general info."
2,I've only got a couple things to say,"Well, i mean it didn't work that well, and it DEFINETELY wasn't worth $14. Neutrogena is a high quality line, but if you want a really good mask, try one of the bottled masks from Neutrogena"
4,Electron Microscopist Review,"Hayat once again gathers leaders in the field of electron microscopy to compile an edition devoted to immunogold silver staining. If you want a compendium of resources for nano-gold labeling of cells for electron microscopy, this is the one reference you want to have. The chapters provide all the information required to succesfully label cells, both pre-embedding and post-embedding."
2,Not bad... unless you want to use it to check an eardrum,"This could be useful to check the throat or to check for earWAX but I got it to check my son's ear for earaches and it just didn't work. The magnifying glass is not strong enough to see the eardrum, and even with suggestions from my pediatrician I could barely make anything out (making it impossible to check for redness). I returned the item because it just wouldn't do. I'd suggest investing in something better and went with the Dr. Mom scope with the LED light."
1,"Lousy, Blurry, and returned for a refund","I bought this at CVS because we needed one immediately, to figure out if we should take our 3 year old to urgent care or wait and see if she was better in the morning. For the price, I knew/assumed it would be cheaply made, but hoped it would be adequate for the job. It was anything but. It's nothing but a penlight with a piece of mylar foil to reflect the light. Could not get the ear in focus at all, and it was difficult to keep turned on since you have to press and hold the pocket clip into the side of the light to turn it on. Never did see how my daughter's ear looked until we took her to the doctor and looked through his professional W/A unit.I also tried it on our 5 year old and my wife's ear, but had no better luck there. Returned it for a refund, and am now looking for a better unit to have for next time."
1,Junk,"This is a piece of junk. The lens is distorted. The light bleeds off of the shaft interfering with the ability to see. Fortunately, it was cheap enough that I could give it to a kid so they could play doctor."
1,Great.....if you want a mini flashlight!,This thing is the worst! If you are getting it for looking at an eardrum then you better look elsewhere!
3,Uneventful,"The box cover makes the film look more appealing than it really is. Each scene seems like there could have been more. Even when the director fades out then goes right bakc to the last scene he was filming seemed unprofessional. As a nerd Mekhi isn't bad. Again there could have been more to this, especially with the brother."
1,good Italian design?,"I dropped this thing and the top of the handle squished in a bit - totally my fault - but this tool should be able to take some abuse and still look pretty. This thing only looks pretty that's all. Go to the dollar store and buy a much better product, it might not look pretty but you can be sure that your friends won't think your a complete moron for spending $100 on a cheese grater."
5,Toe-tappin hits,"I borrowed this CD from our local public library to entertain my children on a long car ride. Little did I know it would entertain all of us so well. Within a day, my 7 and 2-year olds were singing the songs and requesting their favorites (Smelly Feet and Jackie Robinson). Kallick throws in a little unsolicited history lesson with Amelia Earhart and Jackie Robinson and teaches some wonderful lessons, all the while having a blast. The differing styles of music expose kids to a variety of rythyms and tempos and the lyrics can only be described as playful. My children have been requesting this CD again and again and I'm on my way to buy it right now."
4,Another point of view,"It's an important book to have an another point of view of Cuba and his political history, even you agree or not with the author."
5,Esclarecedor,Es una autobiografía que relata muy bien el proceso de marginalización contra los homosexuales y las personas que sencillamente no estaban de acuerdo con el régimen de Cuba. Permite vivir en carne propia y entender por qué casi dos millones de personas se han ido de esa pequeña isla en menos de cinco décadas.
1,Escrito cubano,"Lo compre porque la critica decia: buenisimo. Escribe bien, narra mejor. Pero hay tanta aberracion en su historia que en la pagina 60 ya chole de tanta bestialidad. No tengo nada con los homosexuales, en lo absoluto, no me asuto, pero eso de cogerse gallinas, puercas, gallos, yeguas, perras, bueno todo lo que se mueve, pues me suena a aberracion. No me gusto, no lo recomiendo. No estara en mi biblioteca."
3,Kaplan book review,This book offers college students much needed information on life after getting a degree. I only wish I had heard about it while I was still in college.
3,cool game (review by my 11 yr. old son),"This game is cool because it is more realistic then othergames.Like your hero's gain levels and when they kill monsters they get money and puchase items or weapons.Some hero's are greedy or ,will do any thing for treasure.Others are loyal.There are two kinds of hero's that stealfrom your kingdom.You have choices elves, dwarves or, gmomes I like thedwarves."
2,Majesty's Beauty is Skin Deep,"I was impressed with this product for the first couple hours or so - the graphics and sound were good, and the interface was easily learnable. Soon, however, I realized I was simply playing SimCity with a few battles going on in the background. The fact that the game is mission oriented helps things a bit, but the storyline and background (as the missions are not threaded) were extremely disappointing. In the Swords & Sorcery genre, Baldur's Gate, Diablo, HOMM, and Planescape are all much better bets, even if they are older games."
3,3 seconds of fun,"I liked it ... when I first got it, but over a period of time I got very board of it. The levels are okay, but after a while you realize how boring they are. The graphics are much to cartoonish for a fantasy war game. In closing this game will start off as a 4 star game and will end as a 2 star game, but I guess there might be some people out there who like the game."
1,worst game i ever purchased,"I can't believe that I was excited to get this game. I've had it only 24 hours and I am already bored with it. I have beaten most of the pre-set quests and I am not a hardcore gamer. Where is the challenge? It should take me longer than an hour to beat this thing. There is very little to do with this game. The quests are generic and unchallenging. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this. It is great for my 8 year old nephew, but anyone over the age of 12 will be bored senseless by this game. No wonder gamers switch to pc. I love my mac, but it is games like this that drive people away."
2,Start it up and walk away and let it play with itself,"This game requires no skill or strategy. If you can train your dog to hit the ""return"" key every two minutes or so it's enough to move the game along. A small step above watching television but far less captivating."
2,Zoo Tycoon 2,"While it was easy to order and received quickly, the product did not work and I had to get a replacement. I have not yet received the replacement discs, but I hope to in the next few days. The game itself is great according to my 10 year old!"
4,Great for 1st time user,Exercises were easy to follow. 10 minute segments made it easier to hang in for 30 to 40 minutes of total workout time.
4,Excellent for the Novice,I have bought the 10 minute solution DVD's because as a single mom who works full-time I have very little time for me and I don't have the convenience of going to the gym. These workouts are great. I use them more for getting up and moving than thinking they are going to re-create my body. I feel great and I actually can see results in terms of toning muscles. I usually do 2 or 3 workouts at a time and I generally work up a sweat when I put my heart and soul into them. My favorite workouts are the ones using the fitness ball. They are not so difficult that a novice can't use them but I am sure they are not what you would be looking for if you are an expert. I love this DVD and wish there were a few more out there I could buy.
3,Low intensity workout,"This DVD has 5-10 minute workouts focusing on lower body, upper body, core, cardio and flexibility. The lower body workout is challenging with squats, lunges, and raising the ball over your head and jumping. The Core workout focuses on crunches and working your obliques. The flexibility workout is just that: testing our your flexibility and stretching a lot. That would be a good cool down. Overall, this was an ok workout, but working out with fitness balls are normally low intensity. I consider myself healthy and active, and I normally do moderate to high intensity workouts each week. So, in my opinion, I consider this workout to be low intensity and good to do on your ""off"" day, or if you don't have a lot of time to workout."
3,Not bad....,"It's not a bad dvd, I just lose interest. I do like her upper body 'toning' section. I think it's great for beginners. I am just not big on dvd's so it takes a really good one for me to continue with it. This one will be one I do on occasion. Still not bad for the $."
4,really good workout,I really like this workout dvd. Her instructions are very easy to followand I really like that you can create your own custom workout. The 10-minute blocks are nice if you don't have time to do the whole dvd.
2,not at all what I hoped for,"Haven't watched the whole dvd but from what I saw, kind of cheesy. Not at all what I expected or hoped for."
4,10 minute fitness ball video is great!,"I wanted something that will give me a slimmed and toned effect in only 20-30 minutes a day (and walking a couple times a week) and I'm not in perfect shape (5'2"" and 165 lbs) so I needed something 'realistic' - which is why I bought this. It's a very good challenge for me without being over the top and unattainable. The upper body, lower body, core and cardio workouts are very helpful and useful - but the last (muscle stretching one or whatever) isn't - for me. After using this almost every day for 2 weeks I can feel the difference in my stamina and ease in stair climbing. Sadly, the exercising has caused me to eat more so I haven't lost anything yet - but I'm working on that.The fitness ball and these exercises don't take up much space in your house, it's a relatively inexpensive way to go, and it's even kinda fun.I'd recommend this.Happy exercising!"
3,good dvd,came quick and no scratches on it did not come loos in packing and is good DVD i would recommend it if you have health issues they i cant get on the floor a lot so i use the ball
4,"Good, but tough","I wanted a 10 minute workout that would incorporate my fitness ball and the time crunch I have for working out. This is a very effective workout, however, it takes some time to get myself stabilized on the ball. Excellent instructor; would recommend."
2,Okay,"This is for beginners, she doesn't give enough time and goes on... has 5 different 10 min routines. Best one is the flexibility work out. I use this DVD as a warm up to get onto serious work out."
2,Not for low ceilings,"I own many of the 10-Minute Solution DVDs, and this is my least favorite. Some of the segments call for waving the ball over your head--something that is totally impossible in my basement. And the arm workout is downright boring. Buy Lara Hudson's 10-Minute Solution of Pilates on the ball instead."
5,Great,Finally rolled out my exercise ball. Great workout. Even if the instructor wasnt counting her moves the music will guide you. A plus other exercise vids don't have. There are moves where I can't see the screen. The 50 mins also went by so quickly.
5,"Great workout, in no time!","I am a pretty fit person, but I have areas I want to tone, and I want to improve my overall physical health. So, being a women who gets bored easily with any fitness routine, I thought that surely I could stick to one that only took 10 minutes. And I was right! This is an awesome video, and I always end up doing at least 2 or 3 10-minute segments each time! The instructor moves rapidly which is nice (no boring downtime), and at the end of 10 minutes I have worked up a sweat...especially with the Cardio section. I have also ordered the 10 minute Dance video and can't wait to get it!! This is a workout that anyone can stick to!"
4,Good workout,"This is a good workout that will make you sweat. I actually really liked the arm workout even though it's a stretch to say it's a fitness ball workout (you sit on the ball while doing a circuit of traditional weight exercises). The abs workout was mainly just crunches (though I really felt these working), and I didn't ""feel the burn"" on some of the moves. Legs were pretty challenging (though my lower back started hurting during this session even while I was keeping it straight) and so was the cardio. Stretch was OK - definitely not on par of pilates or yoga. I feel like I got a good workout after using this but it isn't particularly fun to do - you just feel like you're working out like in gym class or something. I like10 Minute Solution: Pilates on the Ballbetter, but I am partial to yoga and pilates over traditional workouts like the ones in this video."
5,Great Time Saver,I love this tape because you can do seperate segments that are only 10 minutes each. You can hit your abs while waiting for pasta water to boil or get a good stretch b4 bed. You can break it up and use it with other workouts to boost your metabolism. I love it
2,Common moves on your fitness ball,"This is a disappointment from my collection of 10 Minute Solution DVDs. The moves are the regular ones which are all effective, but if you are looking for new more challenging moves, then this DVD does not have it, unfortunately. I prefer Quick Fix Stability Ball workout lead by Kelli Roberts as a satisfying workout on the ball."
5,I love this dvd,"I've tried other dvd's and none of them compare to this. It's not just easy because it's broken up into 10 minute segments, it's also easy to follow. The instructor is lovely and knows how to keep you going for that minute more. The exercises definitely get your heart rate up, but they are easy to scale up or down in difficulty due to the fitness ball. I absolutely love the way she does crunches and push-ups on the ball. You'll see results in less time than you think!"
1,You have GOT to be kidding me...,"When I heard of the book I thought it was a joke but then I saw it, and HAD to read it to see if my disturbance was warranted. If I did not know what ""cookie cutter"" Witchcraft was before I do now. I have never read such dribble in my life, and I have seen plenty of bad books in my time. The colorful text and catchy spells are nothing but a marketing ploy to take advantage of the insecurities that come with being a teen. Shame on the author and shame on the publisher! The sad thing is that it will probably sell well so I can only hope those who start on the path with this book have the wisdom to look beyond it for more solid material. I can only pray the author does a book signing in my area so I can personally give her a piece of my mind!!"
1,Worthless,"This book is poorly composed of ""spells"" for Teens who have problems with their lives. I know teens have problems during this time, but using magick to ""get what you want NOW"" is not a good method. Firstly, when you're upset you don't think of the consequences at all and putting a negative spell on someone makes the negative forces come back to you. Do yourself a favor and get a better book by someone who actually knows about magick."
1,Horrible! Utterly Horrible!,"You can tell by reading this title how bad this book is. This book is specifically targeted to teens who know absolutely nothing about wicca. I am a teen myself but coming by wicca through heredity, the first thing I was taught was this ""And these eight words do fulfill: Harm ye none and do what ye will."" That was at the beginning of my teaching, three years later I have found it was nothing but the truth. Every true wiccan knows of something called the three-fold law. This is best taught like this: ""What ye gives out, comes back to thee times three."" If you cast a love spell for a specific person, it will backfire. This book doesn't teach any wiccan basics, if you are seriously interested in witchcraft don't buy it! Buy something else. If you are only interested in getting what you want and hurting your self and others then you should buy this book!Look, this book is horrible!Recommended: Anything by Silver RavenWolf tends to be very good."
1,UTTER ROT.,"Complete and utter rot. Another New Age book appealing to ""teenage wiccans"" who would get what they want with some pathetically simple ritual that empowers them will all the strengths of a ""master sorceress"" written by an author who probably is as ignorant as her readers for a quick profit. Utter rot I tell you. This book is no good for anything but toilet paper.For the simple minded only. Anyone who is serious about anything should avoid this book at all costs."
1,What happened to the Rede?,"""An ye harm none, do what ye will"".Hm... Even the title does't seem to encourage that line of thinking, now, does it?There are other authors out there who can present things in a clear, straightforward manner without talking down to you. Save your money -- this book isn't worth it."
5,Saltwater Tank 101 (and far beyond),"I bought this as an introduction to saltwater tanks... but with as much depth as it has, I don't think I'll ever need another book."
5,Fantastic,"I Got the book quite quickly and was amazed at how good the quality was, I am extremely happy. Have been after this book for a while but didn't want to pay full price Thank you!!!"
2,"high horse - ""my way or you are wrong"" tone","A better book in this price range is John H. Tullock's Natural Reef Aquariums, which seems to me to be based on Julian Sprung's work. Or, spend more and get the bible of marine aquariums: The Reef Aquarium three volume set by Julian Sprung and Charles Delbeek. The authors are well respected, their books are very detailed, and they have a more polite attitude toward the reader."
2,Waste of time,"This book is for those hobbyists that really just started out and have no clue what they are doing. I like to call them ""fish killers."" If you have successfully kept a single goldfish then you might not need this childrens book. The one thing I will say about this book though is it is easy to comprehend, which goes without saying seeing as it was written by someone with the mental wits of a four-year-old. Leave it alone."
5,Made for the Saltwater Newbie,"I'm quite pleased with this book. I've had freshwater tanks for years and felt it was time to move on. This book is very thorough but not necessarily in a ""technical"" manner. His writing is interesting so you're not just trying to digest facts. Lots of pictures which helps to understand, I think. I'd recommend it to anyone trying to set-up or successfully maintain a saltwater tank."
5,One more flattering review,"I love this book, and I love the title. The information is up to date and very comprehensive. The ""conscientious"" part is important to me, having had a few specimens die despite herculean efforts to create the optimum environment. The author clearly describes many species that just aren't appropriate for aquariums unless you are willing to jump through many substantial hoops... it's just cruel and dumb to try to keep some species of coral and/or fishes."
4,Excellent but not enough.,"I'll just start off by saying this is a great book for someone to start with, it touches on almost everything. The only problem I had was the beginning half of the book (mostly dealing with the tank) doesn't get detailed enough and then the 2nd part (livestock) was too in depth dealing with the anatomy and natural habitat etc.. with only 1 or 2 paragraphs out of 30 actually discussing how it would behave in a reef tank, and that's if you're lucky.I'm glad I bought this book, it's helped me get a handle on reef tanks, but it's not good enough to be the only book you'll need and it's not something you will likely reference due to the skill level it targets."
5,One of the best saltwater aqurium book. I think it is the best one.,"The author provides substantial inputs of his experience. It is not like other books, you find information repeated on the other books.The photos are very sharp and in details.The author's experience on the treatment of illness is very useful. You must own this book if you want to be success in keeping saltwater and reef aquariums."
4,good overview,"All in all, the book is quite helpful for initial information in setting up, stocking, and maintaining a seawater aquarium. If you already have an aquarium up and running though, and are looking for detailed information about lighting, chemistry, that sort of thing, this book may be too elementary.I especially enjoyed the part at the end of the book where Fenner describes groups of organisms and gives details on their ecology.Lastly, having lots of color pictures is a plus to this book, as is the easy conversational style of writing."
4,Book of Fishes,"This is a great little reference book with detailed information about each type of fish and with whom they may or may NOT be compatible. Also advises as to the idiosyncrasies of each fish, and photos, as well."
2,Kind of disappointed,"I have used Fluke products for many years now. I also own a couple Fluke meters. They make great meters! However, when I received this pair of d-snips. I was surprised by the craftsmanship. I had purchased these to replace a pair I had lost or forgot that I had loaned out. The previous pair I used for almost everything. They were made by Harris. I was looking for something similar and stumbled across these, because the model number matched the HARRIS numbers. So far, the blades don't close properly and were kind of loose. I did screw them tighter to get a consistent feel, but they loosened up again. Hey, the wire strippers worked well."
1,unlistenable,"You simply can't sell cds with sound like that. Besides that, Callas can't be heard and when she is, she sounds tired."
1,PAINFUL !,"This video is downright painful to watch.The speaker is almost putting himself to sleep.Contrary to the title this video is not about ""developing"" a system. It's a video about ""here's my system"" and it's based largely on fundamentals, not technicals."
4,Great travel reading,"I couldn't have been happier that I chose 'If Andy Warhol had a Girlfriend' for my travel reading. It is listed under the banner of 'chic lit' but deserves much more credit. Alison Pace has written a great story, and an easy read.Jane Laine (what a name), believes she is being banish from her job and suck with the artist her gallery represents... only to find out that she has been anything but sent away!!!Great for the beach or on an airplane... or just because."
3,Good Story,"I enjoyed this book. The title is slightly misleading, but the story does takeplace in the art world."
2,Lacking,"I am not a fan of this book. The author doesn't seem to understand how to keep a story moving and to make it make sense. There are too many characters to keep up with, and most of them are so boring and cliche that you do not care what happens to them. The heriones name is even cliche and so is her lovelife. Jane is bad enough. The last five chick lit novels I read had characters named Jane. But Jane Laine? Yuck. There are a lot of places where we are supposed to laugh or think the story is cute and it really isn't. Like the ""really, really"" joke that keeps popping up. Or the cliche mean boss. Couldn't fall in love with such a tried and boring story."
3,Disappointed with content,"Anyone looking for info on the obesity epidemic would find this quite informative, but I was looking for more information on product labels. Unfortunately this did not cover it as I was led to believe."
4,good workout,Having the option of 3 difficulty levels is nice for making a personalized workout. The head instructor does not get annoying.
4,Good for beginners,"I am a beginner for the most part and just getting back into core work and strength training. this most definitely had me in a sweat.I know that this isn't purely traditional pilates workout, but it still works you fairly hard as a beginner.although there are certain parts that I think have way too many reps to do well with good form."
5,Great Workout Concept,"I recently started working out and I found this DVD on Netflix instant streaming. I am not a fan of Pilates, but I loved the concept of picking your own level. It was nice to step it up a notch on some exercises and take it easier on more challenging ones. I also liked how they ""block"" each level on the screen so you're not distracted by the other level exercises and can focus on the one you're doing. It was really cool to mix and match the exercises. I have used this DVD a couple of times and enjoy the challenge.I do agree with other reviewers that this is not really aerobic. However, I feel it's a nice Pilates workout with an interesting twist."
5,Nice DVD.,"I like this DVD. Good source of workout at home. The quality of DVD, and seller service was satisfactory.I seen this vedio on Netflix, and instatly order on Amzon. I got it in resonable price.Looking for more this kind of DVD.Thanks"
4,Pick Your Level:Weight Loss Pilates,"I engage in Pilates and was looking for a DVD to break up my routine. I Like Pick Your Level: Weight Loss Pilates. I think the instructor is clear in giving instructions and keeps the pace up. I do have issues, however, with the overall concept. There's not a lot of difference between the levels and I think the producers were looking for a way to make yet another Pilates DVD. Also, the workout isn't as intense as I would like. But, thsi DVD is one of my backups that I use when I'm tiring of my routine workouts."
4,Ellen inspires me!,"I liked this DVD for days I don't feel too motivated, because it is short, low impact and I know I can ""pick"" level 1. However, after getting started, Ellen inspires me so I' ll do level 2 or 3 and do another DVD after it."
3,A bit too slow & easy - definitely for beginners,"I chose this video because I like Ellen Barrett as an instructor & was hoping for a Pilates DVD that provided a bit more of a challenge. I feel the title is misleading - I'm not sure why they call it ""Weight Loss"" Pilates, as there is no cardio or anything that I can see that could contribute to weight loss.The video has three different women, showcasing three different levels - with the idea that you can make each move more or less challenging, depending on your fitness level. Unfortunately, I found it all much too slow-paced and extremely easy - even the Level 3 (Advanced) moves. I didn't even work up a sweat and there are so few reps for each move that you start a new move, before you even feel anything from the previous set.The setting is nice & the video is extremely easy to follow. I would recommend this for people who are new to Pilates or for beginner exercisers who just want to get in a little stretching."
4,can be confusing,"Love Pilates. Love Ellen Barret. This is not one of my fav's. Good workout, just the format gets a bit confusing.Love the concept, they should just keep the screen split 3 ways for the entire workout. So you can see your level the entire time."
5,good video,"Nice and easy, I used to excercise to this when I could get it on Netfix, then one day they took it away, so I'm happy to be able to have it."
5,Pilates,"got this at a great price, got item on time! spotted this off netflix and its easy or hard... you pick!!! very good way to tone up that body...."
4,"just starting out, this is great","No exersice for years, i had to start somewhere and not hurt myself. I feel great after this workout. You pick 1 of 3 people for 3 different moderations. the pilates tones, and the stretch is great. I can now feel my abs,its easy, not boring, I am buying more of Ellens dvd's today after using this for 4 weeks. I had back surgary, knee problems, foot problems, shoulder problems and the workout makes me feel great and causes no pain."
5,Exercise DVD,Could not find this product in any stores. Had a copy and got ruined. Found it on Amazon at a super price and the item arrived very fast. Thanks very much.
3,All have the same problem,"The LP guide to Crete seems no worse than any of the other printed guides. They all, by nature, suffer the problem of possibly being out of date even before they go to press. Businesses on the island change very quickly and when a new edition is due to be released some information will have gone quite stale. LP seems to suffer no more than any of the others and the style is typically readable. The usual introductory sections on basics, history, mythology etc are brief but cover a lot of bases in a short space. One major gripe is that it could easily, in itself, warrant a LP volume as thick as that for the mainland. Some popular and interesting areas getting tens of thousands of visitors a year only get an insufficient couple of pages each. Overall though the 1st and 2nd editions seem to have been decent introductions to the island for the first time independent traveller"
2,Big disappointment,"Lonely Planet publishes some outstanding travel books. Unfortunately its Crete guide is not one of them. This book is pitifully short on detail. It is full of generalizations with very little truly insightful information. In fact, it appears to be mainly a guide to hotels and restaurants, with comparatively scant information about the places where those hotels and restaurants are located. I found this book to be a huge disappointment and practically useless as a travel guide. An infinitely better alternative is the Rough Guide book on Crete, which is absolutely outstanding and leaves Lonely Planet in its dust."
5,An Insightful Introduction to the Stock Market,"The revised edition of the Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing is an extremely helpful tool for new investors. The writing is detailed and informative, yet not esoteric. As a high school student, I found this book to be one of the few that was educational and insightful without being tedious. Mr. Kelly has written a wonderful guide for any prospective investor."
5,A great place to start,"It is occasionally easy to make money buying and selling stocks. This book tells you how to do just that! It gives good stock investment techniques for ""home gamers"" that are willing to do some simple research."
5,Neat Little Book!,"This is truly a Neat Little book. I am an advanced-beginner at the investing game, and have tried for years now to acquire a layperson's understanding of how the market really works for people who don't want to make a career of it. This book describes a system of identifying stocks to watch and establishing simple criteria for determining whether or not to buy and when to do so. I haven't tried the system yet, so I can't personally vouch for the results, but I guess the point of the market is that there's no guarantee. We're all just out there trying to turn the odds in our favor and make the most intelligent decisions possible. If that's your goal, this book is worth reading."
5,The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing,"This is, without a doubt, the best introduction to investing in the stock market I have ever read.Through reading this book, my wife has learned the basics of investing. I have also highly recommended the book to my adult children. My youngest daughter has read the book and says it has taken the 'mystery out of stock market investing.'Jason Kelly has written an excellent book, easy to read and understand, without promoting any pet theories.In my opinion -- the best book of its type I've ever read. I recommend it without reservation."
5,Wonderful Investing Book!,"I picked up a copy of this book after reading all the reviews for it, and I must say all the reviewers who gave it five stars are right on the mark. It was informative, and it explained investing concepts in such a way that a novice (like myself) can understand. Also, it got me excited about the possibility that even I can play the stock market, and maybe make a profit like the pros."
3,Take the first half of the book and burn it,Their is some good stuff in the 2nd half of the book. A bit all over the place but something for everyone. The 1st half though is too basic. Like what is a stock kind of stuff.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Hmmm...this book offers interviews and advice from such so-called experts as Gary Pilgrim, the PBHG Funds manager who now faces criminal charges for ripping off his shareholders and resigned in disgrace earlier this year. Kelly says he ""admires"" Pilgrim. The book is full of outdated advice, despite the ""2004 Edition"" on the cover. Don't waste your money."
4,User manual for stock investing,"The book title is the best way to describe the book content; a rare phenomenone though. Rrecommended, to put you on track for stock investing."
5,"The stock market, de-mystified!!","Mr. Kelly has written a wonderful guide -- and it is truly very ""neat,"" if not the ""neatest""!! I am a complete novice to the stock market and was overwhelmed by the number of books available on the subject. I read some online reviews for this book and paged through it in a local bookstore before I bought it -- I found it very easy to read and understand, and it was entertaining at the same time. Mr. Kelly has quite a talent for simplifying and condensing information so that anyone (I believe) can grasp the concepts. Very empowering!!"
5,Excellent examples of the breadth of Southern gospel music,"Robin and Linda have always been known for their tight harmonies, an essential element of gospel music. This album brings together some of the many gospel songs they've performed over the years. ""Is your CD collection complete?"" as Robin would say. ""How can it be without the Robin and Linda Williams gospel album."" And I wish they'd hurry up with a sequel."
3,"ok, but not what i thought i was getting","I was looking for an album by the Good News gospel quartet, with Garrison Keillor. The amazon review recommended this album because the williams are featured on Keillor's show. These guys are okay, but it is not a gospel quartet. Very disappointing!"
1,ineffective and potentially unsafe,"Pros: None.Cons:1) The guide did not fit my bottle of eye drops, so trying to hold it and the bottle was counterproductive. Like spark plugs, I have to ask why the sizes aren't standardized.)2) The attached replacement cover also didn't fit the bottle.3) The guide is not opaque, so I could still see when the drop was coming and could flinch or blink away from it.4) The guide is made of rubber, so downward pressure on it causes the guide to collapse. It's conceivable one could push the tip of the bottle into one's eye with this piece of garbage."
4,Eye drop guuide,"Excellent product. Just what I needed. I recommend this eye drop guide for other elderly people, because it makes eye medication much easier to manage."
4,An excellent collection,Langford has done an excellent job of pulling together some of the key works from the Wesleyan tradition and demonstrated their relationships with one another and their tradition. This is the only book of which I am aware that undertakes this task. It is highly recommended for any interested in learning about Wesleyan theology and the shape it has taken over the years.Also highly recommened is its companion Practical Divinity: Theology in the Wesleyan Tradition.
5,More Elvis,I got this for my mother as a gift once because she loves Elvis. She thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted more.
2,Not all movies are in case.,If all the movies were in the case I would have rated higher. Second time and it still only had 2 of the movies.
3,R.L.s Cautionary tale about Guestrooms.,"R.L.'s cautionary tale about 'guest rooms' These 80's classic kid tributes to the horror pulp genre never get old... the twist endings, 1st person protagonist have roots as far back as H.P.Lovecraft & E.C. Comics Vault / Crypt titles. The series numbering is now gone but the classics continue to live on (or unlive as the case may be)."
4,Lost in realities,"Matt hates his small bedroom. He wants to sleep in the guest room, but his mother says no. One night he sneaks in there anyway and falls asleep. When he wakes up, his whole life has changed. And every time he goes to sleep, he wakes up to a new reality.Good story in the Goosebumps spirit."
3,Look's like snooze time for me!,"R.L. Stine throws a desperate attempt to satisfy his readers. It tricks me but I didn't connect with the book. Stine whips up a plain story about a anxious kid called Matt who suffers complete boredom and wants to sleep in a bigger room. With older siblings teasing him through every corner of life, he sneaks into the guest room and falls asleep. He wakes up and somehow finds himself in a reality time-warp. Waking up and finding himself turn into a different monster or human each time must be stressful. It aint scary. That's what Goosebumps books are all about. Just the pleasure of reading. But trust me, this isn't the best Stine book. It aint even the best Goosebumps book. But if you are a Goosebumps fan and adore his writing, you should go down to the library or bookstore to read it.Stephen"
5,Great Reference Book,Great reference book for collector of 40's and 50's plastic doll house furniture. Copyright in 1997 makes pricing guide a tad out of date . . . nevertheless a good starting reference price range. Great photos. Interesting information on producing companies.
3,Tomart's Price Guide,"I'm disappoiunted with this product. The information contained is helpful, although the values shown are outdated, which is understandable since it was written in 1997. The problem is that most of the pages are trimmed to cut off the beginning letters of the words at the margin, making it hard to read."
3,Works well looks a little Cheap Looking,"The watch works well, the gold tone doesn't even look close to real gold. The delivery was very quick had it in three days."
4,"Great candle, but rather expensive - 4.5 stars","The Tymes Azur candle is best described as an ""ocean breeze"" scented candle. It is a ""masculine"" scented candle, it burns cleanly, and it makes a very nice gift. However, it is a bit pricey; $25 - $27 seems a bit exorbitant for a candle. If it were about half of that price, I would have given a 5 star rating.Regardless, it's a great product."
4,Lyrical poems from Latin America,These are beautiful poems; we are too ingnorant about New World poetry in Spanish! This is a good starting point. Book in excellent condition.
1,It literally smelled bad!!,"I originally bought this same product at a local store... When they stopped selling it at the store, I searched for it online because I loved it so much... When I finally received the product I was so excited and used it right away.. Unfortunately when I put it on .. It smelled like DIRTY SOCKS... I e-mailed the seller and never received an answer. I was gravely disappointed. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!"
2,Not the best item to buy,"The songs are good but the CD lists 21 songs but it only contains 11 songs. Most songs are in Mono sound but they are okay if CD price was from $10 to $12 dollars. The CD case is very cheap and thin, they boxed it on a ""Generic"" case you would buy at your local office store. if i had the choice again i would download the songs instead. Save your money. i bought the CD because i'm a big fan of Sergio Leone's movies and love Ennio Morricone's music as well and wanted to have the CD as a collection but its not worth the money."
5,Wonderful addition to the film,"I purchased this through the seller InAndOutRecords who are located in Austria -- it was shipped very quickly to the United States and arrived in perfect condition, so I can heartily recommend them as a seller.The musical score was a huge part of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Having this CD is a wonderful addition to the film, as I can now enjoy all of the little details of the pieces.As a bonus, the names of the tracks are all in Italian, which gives me a good excuse to brush up on that language!"
5,"Good music, but Ugly CD cover.","I already had the American release of ""Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo"", but wasn't happy how it cut out parts of the last song. That alone prompted me to buy this CD and I'm happy I did. If you can afford it, skip the American release and use a fistful of dollars to buy this import.I guess there are just two types of soundtracks, those with guns and those that dig. This soundtrack has the gun.My only gripe is that the cover is pretty bad. I didn't get the cover that's advertised, but the one I posted a picture of. There is no booklet, but you can't beat this music.Maybe Arch Stanton can rest in peace now."
5,Southern Living: Our Best Low-Fat Low-Calorie Recipes,This book is wonderful for those interested in low-fat cooking. The first part of the book includes suggested menus for various occasions with recipes included for each item suggested. There are also many other recipes organized according to category. The recipes are easy to follow. I have enjoyed every one I have tried. There are many pictures to let you know what the finished product should be. I highly recommend this book.
3,Not bad,Not a western fan but gave this a try.kind of a cross between the king fu Tv series and shangai knights but without the hum our
2,A rip off! Don't waste your money on this book!,"Too bad it took Roger Maltbie 144 pages to say basically 2 things. Most of those pages are pure filler, including 20 pages or so of just blank charts (he could've just included the tear-off chart for you to photocopy). He spends most of the book describing what a ""range rat"" is, and traits of range rats. He randomly throws in photos and tables which don't flow with the surrounding text. I feel that the information contained in the book could've been conveyed through an article in either Golf or Golf Digest magazine. But he'd rather have you waste your money on this book... Here's my tip: just read the Amazon.com synopsis of this book. That should cover 99.99 percent of the book itself."
2,Looking for a creepy Halloween CD? Don't buy!,"I take a chance on these Halloween CD's from time to time and on occasion I get ripped. Basically this one is a bunch of soft electonic bebop music with bad, supposedly creepy, voice-overs. My neighbor thought it was cool, but he also owns a library of 80's dance music.If you are looking for good haunted themed CD's try; A Night in a Haunted House/A Night in a Graveyard, Sounds from a Night of Terror, Drew's Famous Haunted House Horrors, Screamin' Halloween Sounds and Halloween Horror."
5,WON-DER-FUL,"This is a very good CD, it has uplifting, spiritfilled songs for everyone! The powerful voice of Dez just rings out thoughout the CD, just getting stronger as the CD goes on. When you are feeling down play DEZ. I suggest that everyone gets this CD."
1,Worst coffeemaker ever made,"This coffee maker lasted a few weeks, then parts fell apart and coffee poured outside the pot. It is truly amazing that this coffee machine ever made it to the market. The filterholder especially is the worst piece of idiotic design and deserve a special price on its own. Obviously you need to give it at least 1 star to post this review but it does not deserve it."
2,Not a very good product,"Product seems to make ok coffee, but the carafe is so small at the top that you can't get in to wash it properly. Another item that the manufacture didn't test before they brought it to market."
3,false advertising,i ordered black i received white.a cup as defined by mr. coffee is 5 oz while the generally accepted food standard is 8 oz. this is not spelled out in their advertising and is considered by my self to be deceptive and misleading. their reputation does not need to be sullied by some inept marketing personality.
5,A Beautiful Copy For My Collection and Great Service From the Seller.,"I purchased a copy of Robert F. Dorr's P-51 Mustang from a seller linked here on Amazon.com. I collect works on the 'five-one' Mustang as a result of learning about a Great Uncle-In-Law, Capt. James W. Browning. Capt. James 'Gentleman Jim' Browning flew P-51 Mustangs out of Leiston Field, England from 1943 until his death on Feb. 9th, 1945 in a mid-air collision over the Fulda Gap, Germany. Bob F. Dorr has done many works of avaition history and each one is worth the effort to own. Same with P-51 Mustang. I am very pleased to own it, and, will pass it on to my children; Capt. James Browning's Great, Great, nephew and neices."
4,Want to read it again,"The best planee thaat the world has ever seen there should be a series. I hope other people enjoyed the book as much as I did. I hope after people read this book think as the plane more then a plain, but a HERO.Hope you'll read it."
4,What a tool!,"I've been using the Mouse for a few years now and it has been one of the tools I reach for most.It's so versatile! The triangular shape and smallish size makes sanding small areas very easy. You can also sand larger areas also, and get into smaller spaces than a larger sander. The Mouse is small, light, maneuverable, easy to handle, and it's also powerful and works very well! I use it for fixing and finishing furniture, but you can polish with it also (never tried it).This is a user-friendly tool. Big and small hands will appreciate the size and weight of the Mouse.My only gripes are the availability of the sanding pads, I just can't get 60-grit pads. I can get 80, 100, 150, and 220, but not 60, which would help in the stripping department. The other is the Velcro on the bottom of the sanding head started peeling off on the sides, requiring me to glue it back on.Other than that, great tool!"
3,Mostly Plastic,"This seemed to work fine, at first. for really stuck valves it would pull the center out of the cartridge, and also wear down the plastic housing. If you have more then a couple of valves to pull, the wear will become a problem. I owned mine for a couple of years, and yesterday on about the 8th valve it has been used on, it failed me because of the wear on the plastic housing."
2,Not much description provided,"Be aware that this tool is mostly non-metallic, some sort of fibre reinforced plastic. It does not appear to be designed to remove classic Moen 1200 brass cartridges, but may be fine for other models."
3,Nice but ...,"This was a great buy, no more looking under the sink! I love this product, but truthfully you can get the same roll holder at Wal-Mart for a few bucks less minus the shipping. I found this out a month latter... I have children so it's better to shop online but I could of made an exception on this one. :)"
2,toilet paper holder,"Stainless steel holder is grunguy looking and needs to be washed down frequently and that doesnt help much, Very sorry i purdhasded this pot!"
4,Good Value,"Shipped on time, good value, what else can I say... it's a toilet paper holder! (Stay away from the plunger from theese guys...it terrible)"
4,"Loove it. But, does not hold Costco Kirkland toilet rolls (and probably the same for oversized rolls, in general)","This works great overall for standard toilet rolls (diameter). However, it does not work for Costco's Kirkland toilet paper rolls -- they are too big in diameter to fit. So, I wanted to mention that if you use that toilet paper. It probably does not work, in general, for oversized toilet rolls.Other than that, we loooove the way this looks, that it is solid and enclosed from top to bottom, and that it has a lid."
2,Nope! Would never recommend this item.,"I have just received this toilet paper holder and cannot believe I spent $31 for this. First off, it is not attractive. Not shiny and beautiful nor is it impressive in the least. I should have just run over to Marshall's, Home Goods or one of the other nice discount stores and gotten one. I would not have cared it it was $30, and looked good.I will keep it only because I really need it, but NO reorder in the future, and since no one will be complimenting me on it, I won't have to speak of it.It's worth no more than $15. The quality is just blaaaah!"
5,The most amazing series of worship songs I have ever heard.,"This is the single most beautiful and pure CD of worship I have ever heard. Every song on here is gorgeous and glorifying to Jesus Christ. If you are a Christian, I can not recommend this to you enough.Seriously.. it rocks.Highest recommedation possible."
5,Great C.D.!,"I purchased this CD for the ""Revelation Song"". Kari Jobes does a fantastic job on the song, but what surprised me was how much I love three other songs on the CD, too! This CD is a must for all that love the Lord and love to praise Him. I highly recommend it."
5,Love this,"What a great CD and DVD. I am enjoying the live worship. I honestly don't need a DVD, I enjoy a CD just as much. The best song is ""The More I Seek You."""
2,"Good, but not the best of them all..","This is a good video.. I bought it to play it on a theme party, and guests still thought that the 2007 version was much better...I would recommend you buying the 2007 instead of this one..."
4,Great facts... poor conclusions,"As others have said more eloquently than I. However, it is worth repeating (or at least speaking up about it) the fact that the conclusions reached by the author are the worst kind of historical reconstruction.The Soviet Union is presented as more of a victim of the west rather than a primary cause of what the author would have you believe they were a victim of.According to the author, the Cold War was the fault of the west, we were the bad guys. As most who have even barely studied history know, things are seldom that black and white. The author poses his theory without ever mentioning all the offenses and atrocities commited by the Soviet Union which gave the west good reason to be deeply concerned.If you have read Venona or any other more balanced works, you will see this book for what it is and take the facts for what they are worth and leave the subtle attempt at indoctrination out of the picture."
2,unfinished ideas,"As a book, this isn't well written. As for the facts, it seems to be full of bar discussions, none of them finished or with details. It does introduce many different tales from the history, almost as many on the CIA as the British services. It is true that many of the events would still be covered under the secrets act, but if the author's goal was to give insight into these events, a better writeup of each one, staying on point and following a timeline, would make the 'insights' more credible. At least he got the list of heads of both MI-6 & 5 correct."
5,Great SOAP,I first tried this soap when I visited France. I brought soap with me on my trip but then I realized that my soap left my skin too dry. Well I went to a pharmacy in the town I was staying in and I saw this soap. I never thought I would see this soap again outside of France. Its amazingly gentle and has a very nice scent. I recommend buying it. Its the best soap in the world.
4,Beautiful and Real,"R.S. Thomas succeeds in capturing bits of his homeland, Wales, in his poetry. From the verses on Welsh peasants to the reflections on the spiritual nature of the universe, he completely captured my attention. His poetry is like Wales itself - beautiful, rugged, and deeply moving at all times. I turn to his poems to relax, to find peace, to enjoy myself, and to seek God. His poem, ""The Bright Field"" is one of those things that I hold dear in my life. While this collection does have a good selection of his poetry, it does not have all of his good stuff - its too thin. But its really the only thing in print that one can find by him. So I highly recommend purchasing this book to get a taste of a poet who truly knows how to craft words. He should not have been passed up for the Noble Prize when he was nominated for it."
3,"Big songs, small songs","I'm not trying to destroy this CD with this title, but that's I was I felt when I listened it. In fact, this CD begins with a very good ""intro"" and the second song, a roots reggae influenced, ""you run you move"" is far away the best song of S&M's CD. So when I heard this two big songs I think this is the most wonderful thing that's happening to me. Wrong¡ Even if the third and fourth songs are quite decent too, the rest of the album doesn't have the strong of the beginning. It turns from happy dub melodies to slowly and not much elaborated love songs. I'm not sad for having this CD, but I hear only fours songs and then i go to bed."
4,Nearly 5 Stars,"Tracks are slow-hipped, downtempo and firmly rooted with references to Jamaica's Studio One, old school breakbeat and earthy basslines. Lyrics are strident and romantic--backstreet howls and soundsystem laments--meat for the soaring soul of guest vocalists LD, Tammy Payne, Kelx and Rudy. It is difficult to pick a standout as all are burnished alloys of keening voice, dope rhythm and Bristol's trademarked sound"
3,Vocals are (somewhat) distracting..,"I've been listening to this for two weeks straight. The music is an engaging, dubby mix. The vocalists make this a mixed bag. For every engaging vacal comes another that makes me wish for an instrumental version...Their DJ Kicks record is better, but this is worthy for fans."
3,"Good, but I expected more...","Finally! A new Smith & Mighty album... but I'll be honest in the fact that I'm a bit disappointed.""Big World Small World"" (BWSM) just doesn't seem to have nearly as much energy or passion as their ""DJ Kicks"" album. BWSM is definately more reggae driven - and more mellow, which is most evident in another remix of Tammy Payne's ""Same"".There are some definate gems on this album, but if you're looking for another ""DJ Kicks"" like performance - this unfortunately isn't it."
3,book review,The book gives very interesting insight into the book of Revelation but it does not clears out all symbolism and meaning in detail. It is a fresh explanation on Revelation but it lacks information.
3,pretty cheap plastic,"This kit works but is not high quality. There are no tabs to secure the head unit and the ""cd storage pocket"" connections all feel pretty weak. It works but I don't know for how long..."
5,Great fit.,"fit my truck perfectly. the deep shelf would not work in my application, but the shallow shelf is adequate for my use. Made installation of my new radio very easy."
2,"Flimsy design, poor fit!","I purchased this for my 1997 Ford F150, to replace the original factory stereo. This kit does not allow the new stereo to mount flush with the dash. The stereo sticks out 1/4"" or so. The fir on the F150 is poor, not filling the original stereo area filly. There is about an 3/16"" gap on the top of the mounting kit. I will try a different brand...maybe not as cheap, but if it fits...that's OK!"
1,Nothing nice,"All I'll say is... if I thought The company would take this back after I broke the tabs it told me to break off, I would have sent it back with a meaningful letter stating they were DEAD WRONG! The tabs didn't grab anything in my Ford. Thank goodness for clear caulk."
5,Good product and easy to install,"This was an easy and straight forward product to install. I installed this into a 2001 F-150 and had no fitment issues whatsoever, and it looks factory as well. I posted up some pictures as well to see the install actually in the truck.The only negative thing about this kit is that the bottom cubby hole is as small / smaller than it looks. I tried to show this in the pictures after the install was done. I can barely get my fingers in there, and if something were to get to the bottom of it, it would probably have to stay there! I also am not a very small mammal, so take it for what it's worth.I did not take off a star for this negative, because it is not Scosche's fault, they were working within the room they were given by the factory 1.5 din radio."
2,Necessary but garbage,"This thing is necessary because if you're moving from a double din stock to a single din you have to fill the gap with something. Perhaps there are other options, but I didn't know of any. I threw this thing several times out of frustration trying to install it, it's plastic garbage. The anchor thing broke in 1/2 and I fabricated another option. I ended up installing it upside down because it's the only way I could get it to stay in place. If can make your situation work without using this you should certainly do so."
1,Will not work without modifications,I purchased this Scosche adapter kit for a JVC KDR530 USB-CD Receiver with Dual AUX Inputs to install in my 2000 Ford Ranger. The receiver fit into the Scosche adapter but there was no way to anchor it without making several modifications. If I hadn't been mechanically inclined I would have chucked this into the trash.After I got the radio mounted into the adapter I trimmed off the extra clips that the instruction said I would not need for my truck model. When I mounted this into the opening in the dash I could only get 1 of the clips to lock. This does seem to hold for now but I don't know if I'll be able to remove the unit because there is no way to get to the clips. I would not recommend the Scosche adapter kit.
3,Good kit but...,A little on the flimsy side. Unit could be made a little more sturdily. Bezel keeps coming off Alpine head unit.
1,Does NOT Fit the Ford Explorer 2002,"Waste of money since you can't send it back once you have openned it. It is clearly labeled to fit ""all"" in those manufactured years. It does not and I was required to buy the correct kit from a retail store and eat the price of the kit from amazon. Lesson learned - buy local."
5,WOrks great of 1997 Lincoln Contential,"This one works where others do not. If you are wanting to put a dedent system into your Linconl, then you will need this cable...its a MUST!!!"
4,Worked ok in 2009 Ford Ranger,This worked fairly well for a 2009 Ford Ranger. The only thing is it did not 'snap in' and it was lose. I had to rig it with some velcro and electrical tape to make it fit ok. It was much easier than not using it at all. Be sure to get a wire harness for your radio. Those things are amazing.
5,Easy Install,I installed this into a 1999 Ford Expedition and it fit perfectly. Everything was self explanitory and it took all of 1 minute to pop it in.
3,Decent product,"Fit was good, product feels light weight and brittle. I do have concerns about how it will hold up. But it allowed me to install a much better radio in my e250. Time will tell. Installation was quick and easy."
3,Looks nice if you recive the correct parts,This kit looks like it would work nicely for the truck it is made for. When I purchased the kit from amazon I entered in all my vehicle info and this specific model was guaranteed to fit. Well they were wrong! Since I already had my vehicle torn apart I had no choice but to go to a local store and pay more money for the kit that would actually work. But in the end I was very happy with the way amazon handled my problem and how quickly they did so.
5,perfect fit 02 ranger edge,Fit perfectly into my 02 ranger edge. Seems to be heavier duty than other spacers I've worked with. I didn't even need to break off the excess tabs like the instructions direct you to!
4,"Nice Fit, relatively easy install","Installed in a 2001 Ford Expedition. Instructions were well done and the install was relatively simple. Fit with the radio was a bit tricky in that the radio housing required you to bend tabs to hold tight against the fit kit. There was a little slop, but works ok. Kit fit perfectly in the car after some adjustments, etc. A bit a trial and error required to get it just right."
1,Songs are mixed together,The songs are not distinct; the beginning of each song is mixed with the end of the previous one and the end is mixed with the beginning of the next one. The tracks sound really bad alone (or shuffled).
4,I work at banana repbulic,I work at banana now i never really tested this cologne yet ( as we do have testers on all colognes. ) at my store we sell this one for about 34.99.. now the reasons i bring this up is that sometimes you get a better deal in the actual store.. people onlie try to get all they can its a gamble with online purchases that are sold or bought from wholesalers.. but im not complaining i get 50 percent off employment discount anyway so HA!
3,Light fragrance,"A very light frangrance, good for casual or day wear. Although refreshing at the beginning the frangrance does not last long. I read that this was the ""latest"" trend in men's frangrance and with the low cost offered by this seller I was able to purchase and try. The packaging is attractive which perhaps makes a substantial increase to the selling price. If your thoughts are that price equates to a better product I would not depend on that in this case. I would not purchase this fragrance in the future."
4,Great entry level bike,"Great entry level bike for the price. Easy assembly, took about 30 minutes. Gearing was great, took it for a ride right after assembly. The only thing I will change is the pedals which seem a bit slippery after going through mud. The shocks worked great going off high curbs..."
3,Good Bike except for Gearing,"We bought this bike for our 11 year old son. We had problems getting the gearing to work correctly from the start, and finally had to take it to a bike shop for them to adjust. It wouldn't correctly change the front gears, and the chain kept falling off. It seems to be working ok now, and our son loves it."
1,Disappointed,"One of the main reasons I chose this bike (and thought I was paying a little extra) was because it was advertised with 24 speeds, which I wanted for the hilly gravel roads we have here. Once I had it all assembled, I realized it only has 21 speeds. Assembly takes about an hour to unpack, inflate tires, mount front tire, attach handle bar, attach & adjust seat, and attach pedals. A tune-up would take several hours more as the brakes, the wobble in the front wheel, and both derailleurs need adjusting at the very least. For this I recommend the book Bicycle Maintenance & Repair (by Bicycling magazine). The documentation provided with the bike is thorough, but really intended for someone with technical knowledge and know-how. The stamped serial number is not legible - half of it's missing - so it can't be used for identification purposes if the bike is stolen. The bike appears to be of good average quality, but is not as advertised, and has to be returned."
1,Shame on you Barron's!,"I bought this book for the English Comp. section. It contained so many grammatical and technical errors that I cannot recommend it. There were numerous typos, explanations for answers that did not even match the question, answers contained in non-underlined portions of the question, and a number of other problems. Unbelievable that all this is found in a book that is supposed to be used as a study guide for *English Composition*! I could possibly accept this obvious lack of proofreading in a Math or Science study guide (well ok, probably not). I cannot go on enough about how poorly done this was. Shame on you Barron's and the three authors responsible for the Eng. Comp. section!"
2,"Don't waste your money, I'm returning mine to the store","I bought this book as an impulse at a book store, wanting to CLEP the English Composition exam. Unfortunatly, this book is riddled with technical errors throughout. I took the initial exam, missing several questions like I suspected. But the reason I missed some of the questions was because the answers were wrong. At page 62, I had seen enough errors to make me want to return this book. Don't buy it, try something else."
1,How did this get past the proofreaders??,"I picked this up in a bookstore for my English Composition CLEP test, and got through four pages, finding three typographical errors in the example questions--before I realized that they were unintentional. Unacceptable, for sure."
2,"Not funny, but funny parts","This movie was not entertaining. It was baffoonish with way over the top comedy. Many of the scenarios were taken from his movie ""Q."" Some parts were funny, but overall it could have been better. I like the fatal attraction bit. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because I like the fact that Brian Hooks is doing his thing with independent films. This review is not to down the movie, but to give constructive criticism. I am a fan of Maia Campbell..."
5,Excellent automobile reference.,"I beleive that anyone looking for an automobile that could have been made in the US, will find it in this book. Very well written and informative."
5,Excellent for the shelf!,I just took the peds shelf exam and there were questions that felt like they were lifted directly out of this book. I only wished i got to go through it twice! Go through the explanations for every question (even the ones you get right) and you should be good to go!
2,Dishonesty,"I ordered this book ""like new."" If like new involves every answer in the book being circled then I have been educated. This seller blatantly ripped me off on this book."
1,Re: MS Reader Version is cumbersome,"I agree with Ben. Look at the PreTest Pediatrics PocketTest for Palm at www.BrainGlue.com . They have an interactive quiz program that presents explanations appropriate to your choices. The ebooks like MobiPocket and MSReader annoy the heck out of me, having to flip pages back and forth to view the answers. BrainGlue also has a scoring system that analyzes how you're doing in each chapter. It's way easier to use than the MobiPocket or MSReader ebooks."
5,Pulling Down the Barn: Memories of a Rural Childhood,Wonderful book. Anne-Marie Oomen truly captures what it was like to grow up in a farm house in a very rural area. A great read for those of us who share the same history and an evocative depiction for those who are curious about that life.
5,Works and very effective.,"This $5 device is the best thing ever. I've been using it for over 1 month now for toothpaste. I love the fact that when you wind it up, it hides the empty part of the tube. The winding motion is great and it doesn't unwind back. I've used the cheap plastic ones where the empty tube would unwind or it would leave the empty part hanging. The sink counter looks clean and neat now.I will say that it takes some getting used to the winding part near the end of the tube and then removing the tube when you're done. But highly recommended."
2,EZ Squeeze is much better,"I have tried several ""tube squeezers"" and most recently bought this one and the EZ Squeeze. The EZ Squeeze is much better. As other reviewers have pointed out, this product has minimal space for the tube once it is turned a few times and is also more difficult to get the tube into the squeezer. The EZ Squeeze is much better in both regards."
2,A Different Approach,"I agree the newer vinyl tubes are a pain to roll up because they unwind quickly but there's a quick fix for that making this gadget unnecessary. After you roll up the tube, use a clothespin, paper bag clip or similar clip and attach it to the end of the rolled up tube keeping it from unfolding."
3,Good but not great....,This little gadget will definitely deliver the last bit of toothpaste but lining up the bottom of the tube with the slot and then cranking it does take some effort. I bought several to use for Xmas as stocking stuffers.
5,Very useful,"It is not often one can get an item that is not only useful, but does not take up a lot of space, is easy to use and is inexpensive. I had received one of these toothpaste tube winders as a gift and all my relatives asked where I got it. I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon, and have purchased several as Christmas stocking stuffers. Of the ones I have already gifted, they were well received. The quality is good and with very prompt service. I plan on buying more in the future."
2,Just squeeze it,"I bought this `tube winder' for my wife and neither she nor I have been very impressed. While it's easy to get the tube started, the winder doesn't squeeze the tube very tightly which leads to winding up some of your toothpaste in the tail. Once the winder has swallowed an inch of tube it becomes very difficult to wind, so much so that my wife isn't able to wind it herself (the whole point of the purchase).The bottom line is that while you get better results than just squeezing from the middle, you might as well just use your fingers. The time spent winding, attaching, and detaching this product makes this more trouble than it's worth."
1,How many English bands can you name in 60 minutes?,"The only reason to buy this is if you want to find out a little (very little) of the history of Oasis. The rest is total rubbish. There is no Oasis music and the few (very few) sound bites are almost unintelligible. If you can stay awake despite the mind-numbing soporific riff which repeats in the background every 20 seconds or so, you will find that the producers seem more interested in impressing you with their seemingly endless list of English bands rather than telling you anything about Oasis. They assert that Shakermaker is a plagiarism of ""I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing"", so obvious, Noel incredibly escaped a lawsuit. Apparently, they never listened beyond the first two bars of the song. Beyond that, ShakerMaker just isn't the same song. If this is an example of the quality of their material, you have to wonder about all the other tales they tell. If you feel you must listen to this, buy it used and then sell it even more used. 0 stars."
5,Midsomer Murders,Midsomer Murders has been excellent from the beginning and this set is wonderful. I wish it could go on for years.
5,very good white-tailed doe,"very happy with Schleich white-tailed doe. this is a very good look alike, for Schleich animal toy collectors. children love these toys"
5,Hear It.,"Very few times i think in my head ""I'm gonna love this"" just by hearing the first 10 min. of a set; but a little of these few times i say,""I really love it"" in the last 10 min. of it. With this release It happened.Incredibly there's more than one style of house music in this one, but it still sounded like a whole (You would say this is the job of any dj, but it doesn't always happens this way). The upgrades made to the tracks and layered sounds fit flawlessly. For the sake of your electronic Knowledge. Don't Think it, just hear it."
3,A bit insipid,"This is a very ""smooth"" mix but like many commercial mix CDs this smoothness comes at the expense of emotion or personality. Compared to say Sasha and Digweeds Northern Exposure or the original Renaissance series this is generic and lifeless verging on the house music equivalent of elevator music. OK Im being a bit harsh but you get my drift. i bought this after enjoying the Balance 13 which I found a bit more entertaining."
5,Two bluegrass pros taking a little detour...,"A nice change of pace for both of these newgrass old-timers... Rowan and Douglas dip back into the old-fashioned blues styles of the Jimmie Rodgers/Big Bill Broonzy era, sparsely arranged, plaintive material with a stripe of old-fashioned, turn-of-the-century, Gilded Age vaudevillian ""pop"" running through it. This is a pretty eloquent, masterful performance, which fans of revivalist acts like Squirrel Nut Zippers and Asylum Street Spankers should definitely put on their wantlists."
4,Good country music by two masters,"I enjoyed this album, but most of all hearing Jerry Douglas. His style of dobro playing is brilliant. I'm looking forward to buying some of the Transatlantic Session albums on which he plays."
5,Gone to heaven---,"Could NOT believe this--- my two favorite bluegrass artists--- together! Played every day! I knew of them separately, and have purchased other CDs--- but the combination of these two is heaven!"
4,real pefume,"This a fantastic product, a smell from the past when the things were more real.A drop of this spicy perfume last the whole day."
5,Light and lovely!,"I loved Jessica McClinktock until I put it on! This perfume is also a lily of the valley floral but nowhere near as strong smelling! I layer the bodywash, lotion and perfum and it lasts all day without being too strong. I have been wearing Realities for Women for years and recently began experimenting for new fragrances along that same line. I have found this one, Lily Pulitzer ""Beachy"", Coach Signature, Mon Classique de Morabito and Cabotine de Gres to wear that are all florals and are all now my favorites! I am not stuck with only one! All the ones I listed above are light florals. They are all on AMAZON at WONDERFUL prices!"
1,didn't care for it,"I didn't care for it, it was too light and the smell didn't last too long. I prefer a strong flowery smelling perfume"
2,real parfum with fake lotions,The parfum was original but the lotions had no smell at all and the lotions did not have original design as the parfum. Not satisifed with the honesty of product.
1,I can not generalize. I do not like,"This fragrance is considered by some to be a jewel of perfumes and I can not generalize, but I do not feel well, I'm light brown and this fragrance does not favor my pH. Before continuing my review of this item select your fragrance according to your own tastes."
3,it's okay,I like the perfume even though it seemed that I had to spray on more throughout the day. Okay product.
3,Review,"The Item is good, but the packaging is poor, the shower gel crimp had a leak and the almost all of the gel spilled inside the package. However the Body Lotion and the Perfume are in good condition.Please check the items condition before shipping to customer."
2,taking longer time than expected for shippement,"I didn't receive this perfume set yet and so i am getting everyday unhappy for the delay its taking even more than extra 2 days than the regular shipping its almost a week and i didn't receive anything and showing longer than that ,, i couldn't even cancel it if i could i would do ,, i wanted it to give it as a gift for a special event and i am disappointed i would prefer to go to a store and get something better .. if you want it quick d'ont buy it from here ."
1,lmao,when received the perfume it was open... n product was oozin out...every order....ive had two replacements and they wer all the same...i will be very cautious when oredering beauty products.!same thing with other perfume orders...one looked like water n it was jessica mclintock...very weak n im an avid fan of jm
4,Howards Relishes are the Best,"Am a New England Gal and have used Howard's relish for years on everything. It's one of the best on the market out there! Having looked in Arizona for it, none to be found anywhere, I used this relish on hot dogs, hamburgers, and lunch meat sandwiches. I tried other ""sweet pepper relishes"", and unfortunately, none have stacked up to the one I loved and used for years... Howards. Howards website will let you place orders, but they only take checks and it takes a lot longer to get your order. They also make other condiments that are great! The cost is high due to shipping charges from Hometown Favorites but it's based on weight. The cost is still around $4-$5/jar in the grocery stores back in Mass so when you do cost this product out with the shipping it does come to a hefty $8-$9/jar. I ordered enough to last me a bit but am glad to at least find it available on Amazon. Now to find some good New England style Duck Sauce for Chinese food..."
4,Good but not best,"I like the affordability of these CF memory modules, but some of these guys still have bugs in them. By bugs I mean you have to continue to reformat them for them to be operational. However, I have used them on more that one occasion and other than the exception they work as good as all others."
4,If you want to review where civilization was born and when!,"If you want to review where, how and when civilization was born in different parts of the planet, this is a good book. My work as a museologist specialised in education has me adapt different messages to different clienteles. Every time I must go far back in time, this book is among the first I will consult. It is well illustrated with pictures of objects, sketches, maps, etc. It was first published in 1988. A still very interesting vulgarization book. A must in my library!"
5,great t-shirt,"I was so excited to find a Colts t-shirt. It is beautiful, and I will treasure it for years. It was shipped right away and arrived in excellent condition. It is brand new and I could tell. Thank you for having such a great product. I will shop with you again."
5,"another german great work with a ""brazilian"" natural spirit","It takes me ten years from I listened Camioux from Boozoo Bajou to realise who wrote that track and that it is one, the downbeat or lounge musik, apart from jazz... of m favorite stiles. I like so much that ""intelligent rhythm"" that I buyed Dust My Brown also, and I will keeping those albuns (cd souns FAR better than mp3...) always."
5,Chillaxable import,"This is a great CD. It reminds me of De-Phazz, Gotan Project, and Tosca, which makes me wonder why my favorite trip-hoppy, jazzy tango-mambo-samba CDs are by Germans. The tracks are perfect background music for relaxing, reading, working, or doing homework."
1,terrible texture,"I recently bought this product because I've had other Orgran products that were good and it was a fantastic deal.However, it seems no matter how I cook this product, it instantly turns to mush. I've tried numerous times and different cooking methods. It is really inedible, and now I have an entire case that I feel guilty throwing away! This is definitely something to stay away from and spend the extra money on Tinkyada pasta."
5,PERFECT DVD for beginning Spanish Instruction for ALL AGES,"Our ENTIRE family enjoys Mom, Dad And Me Aprendemos Espanol! We have watched it for several months and it is an incredibly useful collection of teachings for the Spanish language. Our three children, (ages 2, 5, and 7), LOVE watching this DVD at home and in the car. They laugh with Vamos a jugar con pelota (let's play ball!), and sing songs like La arana chiquitica (the itsy-bitsy spider) and Veinte burbujas (twenty bubbles) and don't even realize how much they have learned! Gloria Novak's teachings are catchy and memorable because of the real-life experiences shown on Mom, Dad And Me Aprendemos Espanol. We also like it because the words are shown on the screen to insure proper pronunciation for readers, or adults learning with their children. Mom, Dad And Me Aprendemos Espanol is a FABULOUS, entertaining teaching tool and we are thrilled to see our children so excited about the Spanish language because of it!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD based upon other great reviews and was really disappointed. My toddler will not even watch it. He has other spanish DVDs that hold his attention and that he loves. This one moves very slowly and appears more like a home produced video than a professionally made DJD. It might be a good tool for a parent wanting some tips on activities to do with their child, but I know enough spanish to find it too basic. I think there are much better spanish immersion DVDs available. Whistlefritz are by far the best DVDs that I have seen so far and my son just loves them!"
5,"Mom, Dad & Me Aprendemos Espanol","My 4 year old and I very much enjoy the Mom, Dad & Me, Aprendemos Espanol DVD. It is a great tool for learning or reviewing the spanish language. The variety of topics covered along with the bright, varied visuals keep the attention of preschoolers well, and the printed words on the screen work well to reinforce the spoken language. I really like that the creator uses children as teachers in the DVD; this keeps children interested as well. The Spanish folk songs that are used in the DVD are really fun. It's a great gift for children for birthdays and Christmas. Patrick, Nsncy and Emma F."
3,Broke after third use,"I don't make many muffins so it doesn't get used alot, I did make a batch of muffins this morning and went to push out the muffins and the bottom of muffin pan tore. No abuse of the pan at all, it still looked new. I guess I could keep it for a 5 muffin pan but it's garbage bound and I will go back too the metal versions."
4,Previous review read the wrong book!,"The previous reviewer is (I think!) referring to a book with an identical title, authored by Etan Boritzer, which in fact was intended for grade-school children! The book by Haught was not at all ""elementary"", but was very thoughtful and thought-provoking."
4,"""The Problem of God""","Having taken my fair share of theology classes at Georgetown University, where Professor Haught is on the faculty, I look back fondly at the freshman year required course, ""The Problem of God,"" for which this book was the Week One text. The course sets out to inspire in a green undergraduate the basic notion that ""God"" is a far separate thing than oragnized Christianity, and Haught's text serves to launch that discussion straightaway. It riffs on one main theme and in doing so, is meant to offer pause to the kid who is still learning to cross the quad without tripping."
3,Does not last very long,"Right out of the box it was a great blade. Cuts true without any plastic melting. But after 2,000 cuts it is pretty much like any 'ol standard blade. I really thought a blade of this quality should last a bit longer."
4,Love It!,This is a really great cd. I can literally listen to this cd through and through! I don't know much about the group...all i know is i like them enough to leave a review and buy the cd..PEACE!!
4,NASB + light commentary,"Since nobody else has written a review, I'll be the one-eyed person in the land of the blind, having had the opportunity to look at one of these as I stopped someone walking by who was carrying one of these.It is a typical NASB Bible with 2 columns, and every 5 pages there is about a 1/4 page of commentary. Good for a 10+ year old.The NASB is an excellent translation. It was historically one of the earlier translations that emphasized accuracy, but there are now other similarly good modern translations.Hope this helps."
4,easiest format for kids learning to find verses,"I'll be the obnoxious reviewer who doesn't own the item... but think it's worth mentioning that NASB is a great translation for kids-- it's accurate and modern but it's also the only translation I know of that starts each new verse on a new line, so the verses are numbered along the left (not interspersed within the text). For a young one who is learning to look up Bible verses, this really makes the job a lot easier!I'm looking for a NASB for my boys for this reason, but I don't want any commentaries or fillers. I'll keep shopping but I hope this little factor is helpful to someone."
1,NO COMMENT,I was very disappointed when this arrived...I was expecting a dvd to accompany the game and none was found...I doubt that I will ever play this game...
1,North American and European Servers have been closed,Do not buy. North American and European Servers have been closed and this software has no use unless you can read Japanese to play on the Japanese Server
1,Most boring grindfest ever,"While the characters and some environment sure looks neat, it has less of everything to offer than any other MMO. Practically no character customization, no quests, every character has only one real attack for 30 long levels, the places are small and uninteresting, nothing to explore and to try out. The world is the coldest and more boring I have ever seen.Unless you value totally mindless grind, safe your money. There is no value that keeps anyone sensible playing more than a week or two."
1,expensive mistake,"Seemed like a good idea at the time -- putting all the picturesfrom last summer on an external drive rather than burning a stack of CDs. Until within a month the drive fails (with 6 month remaining on the one year warranty) and Iomega wants $1200 to open it up and recover the data.If you go with external drives better back up the back up.And if you're looking for someone to recover data, try Gillware --half the price of Iomega.Once burnt, twice shy -- I won't buy another Iomega product (though theircustomer service was very sympathetic)."
1,Iomega drive fails,I purchased the 120GB Silver external drive to back up my laptop hard drive. The first unit copied the lap top drive but then would not mount on any of my computers. I sent it back to Iomega and they sent me a refurbished replacement. I tried to back up the lap top drive again but part way through the Iomega drive quit and would no longer mount on my computers.They want to replace it again and will not refund my money.I have bought my last Iomega product.
5,Best of the best!,"The Nashville Bluegrass Band is the best bluegrass band out there. And this CD represents them at their very best. All these guys are great instrumental musicians, and the vocals are, as is always the case with this band, beautifully sung and harmonized. If you like a little bit of hillbilly in your bluegrass, but don't like tomcats yowling on the back fence, you'll love this CD. The versatility of the artists is apparent in the variety of styles they use. We have everything from the a capella spiritual, ""Last Month of the Year"" to folksy ballads like ""Blackbirds and Crows"" to great traditional bluegrass sounds like ""Little Whitewashed Chimney"" to the comical ""I've Got a Date"". Any bluegrass fan out there will play this CD again and again, just as I've been doing."
5,A new star is born...,"I first heard of Kristian when I watched 'Win a date with Tad Hamilton' - he had a stand out track 'Shining' on it, and I've been waiting for more material since then.And here it is - his debut single which is a beautiful, mid-tempo ballad. Like a younger and more poppy David Gray, and its a real sing-a-long track.The b-side 'Homecoming' is a non-album track (also a ballad) and is also excellent.I saw him live a couple of weeks ago at a very small gig in London - and his voice is incredible. A really powerful voice.This guy is gonna be one of the biggest new-comers of the year, and one that will be around for a long time to come."
4,"Great story, as always","I only gave it four stars so I could save 5 stars for the very best YYH videos, but this is still a great and essential part of the story. Vital character development develops here as the series prepares for all the adventures that lie ahead. Brutal ending, and one that makes you want to get the next video. Buy and enjoy!"
2,Bad Graphics,Doesnt fit securely to the smaller ps2 and the resolution is pretty generic. I guess its ok for the price. I just expected the screen to mount as if it was made justfor the small ps2 and expected a better picture.
1,STAY AWAY!!!,does not fit! this has been marketed for the slim ps2 for what looks like several years. i can't believe intec has been able to get away with this!
5,"Practical, easy and brilliant!","I waited a long time to get this book and it was worth every moment. The designs are well thought out and easy for even the mechanically challenged to understand. The author has devised an aviary/cage system that can be increased or decreased at will, by adding or subtracting carefully yet simply designed panels. Each panel fulfills a particular function of the whole to form the basic unit and you can add unlimited units to form your ideal facility. This information is timeless and I am very pleased."
2,How to Build everything you need for your birds,I was not very impressed with this book. I was hoping for more detail and plans to get ideas from
2,"If you've got only one bird, look elsewhere",This is not for the do-it-yourselfer who wants to build a cage for his small parrot in the living room. It is for folks who want to build the equivalent of chicken coops in their back yards. I learned more about parrot toys searching the Inet.
4,Very good laptop,"I recently bought myself one of these laptops and I am pretty well impressed by the overall performance of the computer. It has an adequate amount of USB's (4), and other ""goodies"" (like a multiple card reader and a 1394 (firewire) port). My only complaints are that the battery is not very long lasting, and that the speakers are not loud enough. The maximum volume of the speakers is barely audible. I will have to try using a pair of external speakers (computer speakers) to see if this area improves. But overall, it is a good buy."
4,Pretty Good Laptop,"If you need a fast core duo 2 processor, this is most likely the best price you'll find for a 2ghz t7200 processor (as of June 2007). The 1 gig ram and 120gb hard drive are reasonable. The screen could be a little brighter and the sound a bit louder. Nevertheless, its a well balanced laptop."
2,Lasted 4 years before the $280 control box burned out,"I have no complaints about how it worked... when it worked. In four years I had to adjust the ignitor once, no big deal. But shortly after the four year mark, the control box has failed at a cost of $280 for the part only. Problem is when trying to find a control box locally, no one carries them. Some dealers no longer sell Bosch heaters as they have had so many problems with them. These units are now in the $1000 + range to buy, they should last longer than 4 years. The heat exchanger is warranteed for 12 years, but everything else is 2 years so it is not covered."
5,Wonderful Christmas CD!,"SCC does an incredible mix of great Christmas songs on his new CD--some of which are familiar, with new songs as well. His new hit about a child wanting a family for Christmas is very touching. What is especially neat is that there are a couple parts on the CD that are done by his young adopted daughters--the first being the Christmas story read by one of them, and lastly, singing ""We wish you a Merry Christmas"" as the final cut (especially sweet!)This is a treat that should be tucked into everyone's stocking. Steven Curtis Chapman is such a gifted singer and songwriter who truly helps us understand the real meaning of Christmas.""And that's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown""(Linus)"
5,Stephen Curtis Chapman Shines On!,"What can I say besides Stephen Curtis Chapman continues his long running position as an awesome A+ Christian Contemporary Singer. This CD was even more meaningful to us due to the recent tragedy in life, the loss of his young daughter. This CD is a beautiful tribute to the birth of our Lord and Savior."
2,Not much Christmas here,"I get the feeling all through this album that Chapman's purpose was to create a Christmas album that doesn't sound like a Christmas album. No choirs, no bells, no sleigh bells, no Christmas cheer. What it sounds like is simply a cover album, one that has very pleasant and well-done songs, but that doesn't make me feel Christmas in the least. This could be any album from any time of the year--it's just Chapman's renditions of many songs that we know, done in his standard musical style that hasn't changed much or grown over the last twenty years. If you want something with a Christmas feel that's going to help you with your Christmas spirit, pass on this one. If you'd like some nice songs that sound a bit generic, then by all means, give it a listen. The two stars are because it pretends to be a Christmas album, but isn't, really. If it were supposed to be a normal, everyday album, I'd give it four."
3,Okay album,This is only an okay CD. There are two really good songs. The others are just Steven's renditions. There are other better Christmas CDs out there.
3,walkers blows em away,"shortbread should not skimp on butter and flavour.its cool these are organic but,seems like too natural. like they are scared to go large on butter cause someones heart is gonna pop."
4,pretty good book,"I dont think that people under 8 should read it. They might not understand it, but I thought it was quite good. I hope you will like it too."
5,Very Good,"''The Blob That Ate Everyone'' is a very good book. I give it a 9 because It's a 9 point book it has 9 points (plot,understanding,character and is very character driven. plot earned 3 points,understanding 3 points and character 3 points. The Blob that ate Everyone is very good Adam,Alex and Zack write a scary story and every scary scene comes true as Zackie writes his story of the blob monster ""The Blob That ate everyone is not a 9-pointer but a 10-pointer the details give it an extra point. The Blob that ate everyone is very good.It's just a spectacular book."
4,A Blob Is After the Town...,"Zackie finds an old typewriter in a burned down antique store, so he takes it home. However, whatever he types comes true!Sean Ryan, age 1"
2,At least you can laugh,"This film is not for kids; it would bore them beyond belief. On the other hand, the adults might find it close to hilarious. Of course I never expected a serious documentary here, but I certainly didn't expect it to be so absurd. Kudos to the actors for keeping a straight face delivering their lines, which incidentally you tend to hear looped repeatedly throughout the film as if the writer couldn't come up with enough monologue to fill even the paltry 1/2 hour run time of this movie. I think the 5 star reviews posted here are about as real as the ""scientists"" depicted in the film. I hoped this little story would be fun, not FUN-NY (as in, so stupid, all you can do is laugh). The A&E Biography series show on Santa Claus is wonderful, one of my favorites, and I had hoped this film would sort of take elements like that but present it more like a journey, as the title implies, but what could have been an entertaining concept fell flat on its face in the execution."
4,"Solid Sequel, Less Action but Good Military Sci-Fi","""Orphan's Destiny"" picks up immediately following the events of the series's first book,Orphanage (Jason Wander). We find newly field promoted General Wanderer trying keep the few remaining heroes from the ""Battle of Ganymede"" alive. Since the travel time involved, using human technology, takes so long for interplanetary flight, many years have passed before Jason and his troops return home...and the home he returned to is a very different place than what it was when he left (both socially and politically). Where does this new environment leave the new General and his veterans? Robert Buettner does a very good job spinning this tale and adds the same humor found in the first book...mostly at the expense of Jason Wander caught like a deer in the headlights!Highly recommended sequel! I am already reading the next book,Orphan's Journey (Jason Wander)."
3,Entertaining Military SF (3.5 stars),"Following on from the equally entertaining Orphanage, here we have humanity celebrating the defeat of the alien 'slugs' but assuming that the threat is over. As we know, in these books, the threat is never over so when there is another attack on Earth, young General Wander once again has to step up and take radical action.This is no sci-fi shoot 'em up as the author takes care to set the scene and build characters so you actually care what happens. Fast moving and actually far more intelligent and thoughtful then other novels of this type. Best to start with Orphanage before this though.."
3,Decent followup,"I enjoyed Orphanage, it was a fun and quick read. Yes, as many have said it reminded me of Starship Troopers and The Forever War, but that was a good thing.With Orphan's Destiny it deals with the Peace and how Wander deals with it. He feels the alienation and survivors guilt but faces it in his own way. I enjoyed this book a bit more than the first because it dealt with the aftermath of the first book. I wish that there was more interaction with Munchkin and her son, but maybe in the next book(?).If you liked the first book then you should enjoy this. A good book and a quick read."
3,Familiar,Better than TV but pretty common thememes if you have read any military SF before. An OK read.
4,Nice ring for the price,"I bought this because I love Lapis, but most jewlery items that has Lapis are far too expensive.The stones are of decent quality.Even though they are not perfectly set they still make a pretty ring. There is one tiny impefection it look like there was a tiny scatch on on of the inlayed stones. The main problem I have with it is that you can visbly see the sodering mark inside the band.This is were the ring was joined together.This doen't mean that it will come apart.It just means that the jewler didn't sand down the mark well enough.I recomed that if you want a peferct Lapis ring then this isn't the ring for you. In my case I love jewlery that has some imperfection it make the item look more hand made, not stamped out by a machine."
1,Just A Cheap Imitation,"I was a huge fan of the Barrio Boyzz, but after the departure of it's three founding members (Angel Ramirez, Robert Vargas, & Louie Marreo) with out it sounding to much like a cliché the magic was gone. Just listening to the difference in sound and the quality of harmonies in this album and you will be just as disappointed as I was. Unfortunately they have become a cheap imitation of what I knew to be the Barrio Boyzz. I am giving them one star just because that's the lowest rating I could give them, because if it were up top me I'd give this album a -5. To all the original fans out there just reminisce on the good old days with the album [...]."
2,I'm glad someone else noticed the cover.,The answer is 176 not 166. How did they miss that? I hope the information inside is better than the cover.
1,Pet Flowbe,"This product I thought was useless!! It was imposible to get an even cut. I followed the directions to a tee. They say to use a up and down motion rather than a combing motion to let the hair get sucked into the cutters. WELL guess what it also makes the cuts choppy and uneven. It looks horrible. So I contacted the manufacture as stamped on shipping label, and guess what they charge a 20% restocking fee and return shipping so it is hardly worth the expence of returning. I was very disapointed with this product . They should be ashamed!!! I know that my dog is !!!"
4,Well Written Slice of Texas History,"Although the author was 104 years old when this book was published, he wrote a very interesting personal history of his years (1916-1944) on the border in the Big Bend area. Both a soldier and a professional photographer during that period, Smithers punctuates his tale with many excellent black and white photographs that suggest a feel and mood of a place and time long past. His old memories are perfectly clear and amazingly detailed. If you love Texas or Texas History, you should definitely read this book."
4,A Great affordable laptop,"I ordered this computer a while back. I have been using it for several months as a student for school. The hardware on this computer is excellent, but the first thing that I did was remove vista.When you have all the correct XP drivers it runs XP very well. I am currently dual-booting with Ubuntu Gusty and Windows XP professional. Everything works like it should.There are a few things about this notebook that I don't like. There are only 2 usb ports. Which can easily be worked around if you have a separate $10 hub. And it is difficult to open as the weight of the notebook is closer to the hinge so when you lift up the cover, you have to use two hands.However I can't really complain, when I was looking for a notebook I wanted a harddrive over 100GB, a nice screen, a dvd burner, and a core2 duo processor. This thing serves those purposes very well."
4,Excellent value,"For the price this is a great CD. There is a variety of both the nature sounds and the instruments that accompany them. I thought it would be more of the nature sounds, such as waves crashing and rain storming, but the instruments are the obvious music. Still, very relaxing. It's something you'd expect to hear while receiving a massage. Nice background music."
4,Just Enough Req Management,"Alan Davis has written a good book on Requirements Management. He has explained his approach and includes a lot common sense with it. I had just finished a class discussion on requirement attributes, and we had ""brainstormed"" a comprehensive list of 30+ attributes. On this topic, Davis explained how his opinion had changed over time so that now he felt eight attributes was enough. I agreed completely. Reviewing a list of a hundred or more requirements, and validating that each met a list of attributes, which list makes more sense to you - 8 or more than 30? A good book, but a little ""over-priced"" for $35 for only 240 pages."
3,History of the John Hunt Family From the Begining,"This book is okay, but only gives information on this one person. It is a wonderful testimonial for John Hunt, Sr. and his children. As far as information on the Begining Hunt's there isn't anything definitive."
2,"Once again, a pro-choicer misses the point","The author of this book makes an almost moving case for keeping abortion legal. She gives a lot of anecdotes, but they make a point that every thinking person has already thought about. Pro-life people don't doubt that ""behind every choice is a story,"" nor do they doubt the difficulty of the choices that people have to make. Rather, pro-lifers believe that while no outcome is ideal, the unborn human has the right to a chance at life.Like too many pro-choice authors, this author fails to make any comment on that pivotal issue in the debate. Like too many commentators on both sides of the abortion argument, Gloria Feldt make a lot of emotional appeals while dodging any ideas which might be inconvenient to her side of the issue."
4,The Medieval Ages Get Doctored Up!,"Kathyrn Swinbrooke, physician, herbalist, and leech, makes this period piece seem like a series of anachronisms, but it's well worth the time to delve into this exciting Medieval mystery by one of my favorite authors P.C. Dougherty writing as C.L. Grace. The author is able, due to his expertise in this period of English history (he holds a doctorate from Oxford), to make his tales sound genuine and forthcoming. It's interesting, too, to see him portray Edward IV and Queen so vividly and, with a keen sense of awareness, gives us an insight into the Future King, Richard Duke of Gloucester. Little does Edward realize his short lived tenure!A good read!"
4,This is good read with excellent points for church leaders.,"The African American Christian man is very good book by Eddie Lane which gives a very clear and accurate picture of the dilemma facing the African -American church. Eddie Lane provides some points that should be considered for the church or religious group trying to minister to Black men. The author expounds upon issues which have contributed to the lack of men in the church. He provides a variety of illustrations that clearly and concisely show the points he is making. I recommend this book as valuable tool for helping to teach on men and as tool for developing further outreach. Other recommended reading - ""Reclaiming the Urban Family"" by Willie Richardson."
3,Had problems at first,"Bought this light and it seemed to work well for the first week, but then it would not turn on when the you press the swtch. I was going to return it but we see that now you just have to turn the swtch on and the light will eventually turn on. we have gotten used to it, so it works maybe not as well as it should but it works"
3,good light source sofar.,"I bought this for my yellow belly sliders 55 gallon tank and it dose a great job of lighting up his tank. although it was slightly exspensive I feel that it works well and was worth the purchase, I am thinking of buying a second one to place on my other tank as long as this one countinues to due well."
3,Looking for a light under cabnet over the sink.,This light did not meet my requirements. I hung it in place above my sink and while it was not right I installed it any way. It was held up by tape. It was working ok but the tape gave way and the light fell in the sink and was damaged beyond repair.I am writing this because the light would have been great if used for lighting a wall art desplay
2,"""Tales of Kleinzach?""","Hoffmann, the central figure in this opera, may be a drunk, a loser in love, and a paranoid personality, but at the same time, it's clear from the libretto he's a romantic poet, and the world IS against him. For whatever complex of reasons, though, - soprano Maria Bayo in the interviews is heard muttering some nonsense about Freud - Hoffmann, according to director Giancarlo Del Monaco's ugly and unsuitable ""bright"" idea for the part, is portrayed as a demented hunchback, more Kleinzach than any recognizable Hoffmann, given the libretto.The production strives to be novel and ugly throughout, and in this aim, I'm sorry to say, it largely succeeds. The only saving graces are the very voices of Machado (Hoffmann), Goeldner (Muse), and, above all, Poblador (Olympia), the stunning and believable automaton. In the area of voice itself fortunately, the star director found one place where he was unable to tamper and maim."
5,The End of Majin Buu???????????,"I saw these episodes in Japanese in subtitles. What happens is everybody killed by Buu is wished back except Babidi and Dabura( who's in Heaven with Bulma, Videl, and Chi-Chi. We see some old friends return to give their energy to *spoiler* Goku's Spirit Bomb. Spoiler: We see Android 17, carrying a shotgun and wearing a trenchcoat; Android 8, Sinow, and Launch( good form). The person who makes the wish is none other than *spoiler* Vegeta, yes Vegeta, I'm not joking about this; to Parunga, New Namek's Enternal Dragon, with Elder Kai *spoiler* with halo over head and KibitoKai *spoiler*( Supreme Kai and Kibito's fusion)."
2,An antique--look elsewhere,"Although it is the opinion of this reviewer that if you are doing NLP you should be doing prolog, this isn't the best book for the task. Look instead to ""Prolog and Natural-Language Analysis"" by Pereira & Shieber, or ""Natural Language Processing for Prolog Programmers"" by Michael A. Covington.When Patrick Blackburn & Johan Bos's new book comes out, it will be the one to buy."
3,"Great beats, fantastic music...but vocally, a disappointment","Elvis Crespo is fantastic at getting the merengue party going strong. Wow Flash is certainly a great party record, full of propulsive beats and really enjoyable horn stabs. Elvis's voice, however, has always been an acquired taste, and here it is no different. He has a very nasal delivery, and honestly is not very melodic. He is committed to what he sings, and he sings with passion, but you either love that nasally tone or you don't. For me, it is not really my favorite. That said, the music goes over very well at a party, and it is great in the mix with other tropical beats. The title song feels a little forced to me, and the world did not need a pop version of it, I'll tell you that for free, but none of the above complaints have kept me from enjoying some moments on this album a great deal--I just don't think that I will return to it frequently after its initial blush is gone."
5,Stinks so good!,I want to find a perfume like this. I use it on my hands every night. You won't be disappointed.
4,Good product,non greasy and absorb quickly. I like the smell of it but would like a little heavier cream for my dry hands. Will definitely recommended to my friends. Received product as promised with no damage. Will buy it again but use during the day.
1,Too out of date,"It is not without reason that the Forsyte Saga, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter are John Galsworthy's most famous books, dealing with the Forsytes. They are good reading and ""timeless"".This is not true for The Saint's Progress, Beyond, and The Dark Flower, which are downright boring to modern readers. It is hard to believe that they were written by the same author!"
4,Great AAGPBL book,"Susan Johnson leaves nothing out in her account of the 1950 playoffs series between the Rockford Peaches and Ft. Wayne Daisies. Well written with the lively enthusiam that could only be brought to the pages by an actual fan of the teams written about, Johnson's book not only gives a solid history of the entire league, but also gives a highly detailed account of particular players and games during one season. A must have book for AAGPBL enthusiasts."
5,The Best of Bobby Timmons,"This album is fabulously funky and exhibits the many musical nuances of Mr. Timmons. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate good jazz piano playing. Believe me, you will like it."
3,basic but outdated,"Covers most aspectsOutdated techniques (Pictures with wooden raquets, need I say more?)"
1,AWFUL!!!,This book was just awful I'm sorry to say. I was so disappointed!!! I should have bought a book by a writer that I know I can count on...Kim Corum does it best!
4,Great piece of acoustic music by a master singer-songwriter,"It's hard to classify this CD -- bluegrass, folk, country? It is uneven in spots in terms of the quality of the songs, and I think O'Brien could have used a more full instrumental package on some of the songs. Still, who am I to question producer Jerry Douglas? Many of the songs grow on you and make you want to hit ""replay"" again and again. I bought it after being blown away by hearing him do ""Brother Wind"" on Transatlantic Sessions, and I'm not sure that song is even the strongest on the album. I bought it used, and it was more than worth what I paid for it. I'll be getting more of O'Brien's CD's in the future."
5,serendipity books,"I read these books to my children when they were little, and now I have the privilege to read them to my grandchildren as well. Thank you for helping me start a tradition. I love the stories, the morality lessons and the beautiful illustrations. My grandchildren loved them too."
4,No problems,It works ok had 2 do a lot of cut 2 the radio would fit but other than that its workin find so for
1,Waste of time & money,80%-90% failure rate means these discs are very expensive. Go with name brand such as Verbatim. Would give 0 stars if option is available.
1,Just take your money and rip it up.,Steer clear of these $2-3 adapters. They have a bad connection and won't power up when you plug them in.
3,careful what you use it for,"the item came quickly and just as described, and sends power, but not enough for the application i was using it for. i had lost my computer charging cable for my laptop but had a car charger for it, so thought this would be a cheap alternative to buying a new cable. it wasn't. even though the adapter works and the car charging cable recognizes it is getting power, it doesn't provide enough power to charge the computer. this works great for applications like cell phones, but does not provide enough power for bigger uses"
1,Does nothing,"I got this to power my 12v Air Pump and it does not perform. I had to go out to my car to use the pump. The light turns on from this adapter but, when I turn on the pump, the light goes out but the pump doesnt work. No good to me."
4,Okay,This is okay. I bought this to charge some massive spotlight that my parents got me as a gift. It does charge. The issue I have with this unit is that the plug from my devices ( tried multiple items) are loose when you put plug them into this. Seems like they would fall out if something bumps it. I would just use a rubber band or a zip tie to hold it in place while charging. I doubt it would power anything larger then a car charger such as a cb or scanner. Overall its does what it advertised. I am satisfied.
3,Frank for Christmas,"I like Frank but am not a huge fan or anything. I found this Christmas CD to be kind of boring, not the best Frank I've heard by far. Just didn't give me that jolly Christmas feeling."
3,"Not the ""GTO Bible"" but it may be the best out there.","I have had the GTO restoration guide for almost 10 years now. It is a useful book, but it does have some short-commings. An index would be nice, since it is so disorganized. Some part numbers I have found have been wrong, or not complete. The information that is available for the Corvettes makes the GTO Restoration guide look like a joke! We need a more complete and accurate book for us Pontiac Lovers."
3,A Lukewarm effort,"I would have to agree mostly with the comments from the person from Locust Grove. The book makes a real attempt at naming all the part numbers but thats it. The organization was terrible. The blow up diagrams are helpful (if you have a magnifying glass) and it can be real confusing matching pictures to their proper years. If your seriously going to restore a GTO, buy the car first and then buy the original shop manual, wiring diagram parts list and so on. You can get it from Llyod's website which is linked under DealsonWheels.com. It'll run you over 200 bucks but its well worth it, it covers the specific year and some of the manuals come printed on oil resisitant paper, A nice touch.Give me a GTO over a women anyday, at least the ""Goat"" won't talk back to you......"
3,Amazon sent the wrong edition of the book.,The book pictured is the second edition but I received the first edition. The book was returned for a refund. The book is good but make sure you get the second edition .
5,Where were you ten years ago!?,"Although R. Crumb's ""Want to improve your art? DRAW. Wishing won't make it happen!"" is the best ""How-To"" advice anyone can give/get, books like this are still quite helpful and inspirational. I bought this book, ended up loaning it to a friend also interested in it during an OT period at work. Later, I just bought another copy for myself!!! It is that good."
2,Not useful for drawing instruction,"While a few helpful tips are included, this book is concerned primarily with listing various characters and props in the fantasy genre and showcasing the artist's work. If you are looking for guidance in drawing the characters or props, this is not the book for you. If you are unaware that the fantasy genre includes warriors, elves, and wizards, then look no further."
3,Bait and switch,"I thought this book was worth more than 3 stars; however, since I already have this identical book with a different cover I though it would be a good idea to let the publishers know how disgusted I am when they change the cover on a book so they can sell more copies to unsuspecting buyers. Shame on them."
5,Cracker de luxe,"I've seen several of these terrific shows in the past and wanted to have the entire series for my DVD library. Highly enjoyable entertainment. No boring, cliche ridden stories with stock characters. A timeless series to watch over and over again. Re the packaging: while I prefer metal or plastic holders for multiple discs (a la ""Hustle,"" ""M squad,"") the smooth covered cardboard casings for 'Cracker"" is perfectly acceptable."
5,Absolutely magnificent!,"I was brought to the world of Cracker after watching the latest episode on TV long ago. Once I bought this collection and enjoyed every single minute of it, I did realise that the latest episode was not very good in comparison with the first productions. Robbie Coltrane is absolutely magnificent in his role and Fitz's humour throughout the series is a complete delight. If you like detective and crime TV series, you will not find any better than this!"
5,loved the series and love this set,"My husband and I watched the Cracker series out of order many years ago on TV. Decided it might be fun to view the whole series in proper order for the ""back story lines.""So far, have watched several weeks and we are having a ball. The quality of the DVD's is excellent, even on our 60"" TV, and the sound is great too. (With the British accents, that is a real plus)."
4,not for the kiddies who love hagrid,"For heaven's sake, keep the kiddies away from Cracker: The Complete Collection ($119.99; Acorn). Yes, it stars Robbie Coltrane but the boozing, whoring and gambling criminologist Cracker (brilliant at his job, dismissive of his colleagues, mess of a home life -- in short, the typical British crime fighter) couldn't be more different from the Hogwarts fellow. This set contains all 11 of the feature-length mysteries from the show's run, which blessedly ended before Cracker could turn into a caricature, the way Jane Tennison threatened to do. Great stuff and a nicely compact set, but awfully expensive for a 13 year old series that was never a huge hit in the US anyway. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
3,Dark but compelling,The series is interesting and the stories are compelling. I find little to like about the character. The series focuses on all his faults. The women all love him but its not clear why as his flaws are not balanced by any personality assets.
5,Interesting,"We both loved this collection, except for the ""bash the Americans/they deserved 911"" entry inthe collection. Even my husband, who is English, was offended by that.Robbie Coltrane is superbly fascinating and we enjoyed looking at the mysteriesof murder from the psychological standpoint.Highly recommend this!"
1,Overpriced,"Well it was my fault. There was referenced method, sourced in this book, in a very useful thesis on anti-patterns for FTA so I took a punt and bought the book. Dated. Thin. Worth less than half the price."
5,Raid on the China Coast,"Very nice puzzle, much higher quality than most, it was a lot of fund to do. I highly recommend this puzzle to anybody."
4,None better for PRICE!!,I have bought many speaker as I have done installs for 15 years. Jenson for the price just cannot be beat. I know they own other brands too.. Their cheapest 2 way speaker whether 6x9 or 6.5 sounds as good or better than most entry level to mid level car speakers to 90% of the people.they handle any power you can dish out without distortion on most entry to upper level priced amps.Boats can spray with silicone and not worry. tough and cheap(not cheaply made) sounds great-always.
5,the boogieman from Hell does it again!,"Nonstop high energy boogie and blues from the master! Can't understand why this guy isn't a megastar here in his own country when he's a genuine guitar heroe in Europe. Maybe they have better taste in music across the pond? Anyway, if ya like yer blues loud and electric, Katon is yer man. Mike is also one of the best slide guitarists around...i've seen him dozens of times and he always delivers the goods. And yes, he is from Hell...Michigan, that is!"
5,Multi purpose!,"All year long, you can do a fine job dusting up a storm in your home! But, on October 30, just toss on a short black dress and frilly white apron -- and you've got yourself a FRENCH MAID'S COSTUME!All that for $.93! Now imagine all the free candy you'll be scoring while going door-to-door... Well, you just can't afford to pass this up!Step out and buy the ONE cleaning product that says you are UNAFRAID to make a BOLD FASHION STATEMENT!"
4,"awesome, new sounds, this DJ got SKILLZ, to pay da bills!","I had this cd for a week now, and when I listen to it while driving down the highway, I find myself driving faster , track 5 of the 1st of the 2 discs is my favorite!"
5,one of the best house compilations pre- and post millenium,"With Yoshiesque, Deep Dish concocted one of the last great mixes of the 20th century, an effort that hasn't really been bettered in either physical or digital formats. I love it for the mix of soulful and teutonic tangents: oliver lieb through ian pooley to n'dea davenport and the mysterious people. I am actually surprised that many of the reviews favor the 2nd installment, which is great, but had less of an impact for me, personally. I considered a review having purchased a used copy of the REACTcardstock import set today for a pittance in order to replace my well-worn domestic jewel case edition....."
3,A Classic Breakthough Album,"Time has not been overly kind to this album, but Yoshiesque still remains Deep Dish's breakout album and is worth a listen. An incredible change in feel and sound occurs between this album and Penetrate Deeper. The duo's skills on the decks and with sound editing make a clear and discernable advancement.Disc 1 is a little unusual for a Deep Dish set with the featuring of 17 shorter tracks. ""Under The Water"" by Brother Brown (feat. Frank'ee) is terrible, but the excellent ""Rollercoaster"" by Amoeba Assasin also makes it way onto the set.Disc 2's ""Darkness"" by Satoshi Tomiie is a great track. I'm not sure what was going through their heads with the inclusion of a dub by the Culture Club or N'Dea Davenport. Definitely a product of Sharam's tastes.The album is worth a listen, but if you missed it, I don't think it is worth buying. Not one of their strongest albums.Disc 1 gets 3.5/5 stars, and Disc 2, 3/5 stars."
1,OUT OF DATE,"Please note, we at the Nonprofit Sector Research Fund have recently received several letters by students requesting applications and stating that they read about our program in this book. They are sent to an address that has not been in use for five years, for a program that no longer exists. Scholarships change, and this book is about eight years old--that makes it NOT a good resource. I am only giving it one star because that is the lowest option."
1,"Horrible, waste of time!","The only thing this book tells you is how to use the authors software, which by the way is garbage. Yes I was foolish enough to buy into the whole red light green light bs. There really isnt any info about the stock market or how to trade it...unless you own the software. If you are looking for trend recognition software check out premiretrade, much better choice."
4,Helpful but some revisions resulted in even less information,"I confess that I am a little disappointed in the revised 3rd edition of this book which I purchased after seeing an earlier edition in the reference section of our local library. I am a collector of Big Top peanut butter song glasses, and this book seems to be one of the few that has information about these glasses. When I looked up the Big Top glasses in this latest edition, there was actually less text and fewer photographs of these glasses than there had been in the earlier edition!! For this reason, I have a hard time considering the third edition ""revised and expanded."" There are also a number of Big Top glasses with children's songs that are not listed (London Bridge, Farmer in the Dell, Little Bo Peep, Billy Boy, etc.)"
3,"Good, but no real believers","I looked through this book for the ""believers"" essays that the description mentions, but there's only one and even that is too short to really use in a classroom. I'd like a more robust selection of believers to give my students a chance to flex their skepticism muscles. The skepticism essays are pretty good, especially the ones about the Bible Code and the use of the word Mongolism.Anyway, if you want a book to help teach skepticism or as a component of a writing course (composition courses can use the skeptical stance in effective ways) then check this out. Just beware that the believers don't get their say."
4,"A useful reference. Well written, well organized","This is a very readable guide on how to choose chords for a progression and notes for a melody. The author clearly outlines the conventions of Western music composition and opens the door to deviating from those conventions to surprise listeners and keep compositions fresh. This book won't make you an instant Beethoven or Stravinsky. But it's a good foundation for songwriters in any genre.If the author had more to say about rhythm, the book would merit 5 stars."
3,Very very basic,"It's way too basic for me. I don't need the grade one basics, so it wasn't much help. If you are just starting out this book would be of use, but if you are proficient at an instrument and have actually learned to read music at a high level then find somethign else."
3,Good Primer,This is a good primer on writing music. It does present some useful ideas and tips and common approaches to writing music. It helps to already have a basic understanding of music theory before you start this. it also helps to have a keyboard nearby to play & hear the chord progressions presented.
5,Very helpful,"A bit repetitive with his other book ""Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory"", but fills in the music composition blanks. I suggest the two as a set to get you fully on your way to being a better musician. However, if composition is most important to you, this book does cover theory enough to make the composition aspects make sense."
3,Good for a basic introduction,"I think there are many details that are left out of it- particularly I wanted to learn more about counterpoint and the book does not even mention Fux's species system. It doesn't cover strong vs. weak beats, or secondary dominants, the significance of the tritone in dominant 7th chord, and many other topics that are more involved which I am beginning to read about in another book.If you just want to know which chords will lead to other chords, so you can write yourself a really rudimentary cliche pop song, then I guess this book would be great. But if, like me, you're trying to figure out how a complex piece is structured, I would definitely get a different book."
2,Even beginners don't need this book,"I thought I might find something new here, but honestly, absolutely everything in this teeny little book is better and more fully covered on the internet. Please people, search engines really work. Don't waste your precious bookshelf space on this one like I did."
1,Disappointing.,"As a beginning crocheter, I was very disappointed. The size and type of this book make it difficult to use. I wasn't impressed by the information which is always available in pattern books anyway. Most of the pattern books I have are much better when it comes to explaining basics, stitches, working methods, etc. I didn't learn anything new. I won't keep this book as a quick reference either since it only talks about the basics one knows and doesn't forget."
2,The Crochet Answer Bopok,I was very displeased with this book. The context are good but I was buying lefthanded books and I thought this book was for lefthanders and it wasn't. Also it is so small that I can't use it with ease. The book will fit into your pocket.Very small.
3,The Crochet Answer Book,"I was very disappointed with this book it never answered even the most simplest questions, I have other books that weren't as extensive that answered the most essential crocheting answers. It had some info but not what I expected, it fell short. I am sorry I purchased it."
3,"not all, but most","maybe ALL for an experienced, but certainly few for an autodidact beginner.nevertheless good reference book."
4,Handy Little Book,I like this little book. Not only does it provide quick access to answers but it also gives you a little review of how to do a certain technique. Fits right into my small crochet bag just in case I need it and it's also a good read.
5,Great Reference Book,I've been crocheting for about 40 years and I still feel this book was a great purchase. I'm always eager to polish up my techniques and learn something new. This book seems to have the answer to anything you want to know about crochet. I keep it in my project bag at all times!
4,Great Reference Material,This is a wonderful reference book for crocheting and a fantastically handy size. I plan to put it in my craft bag and carry it along when I need it!
5,Gotta have it!,"I carry this book with me EVERYWHERE. It is the perfect size to fit in my purse, my crochet bag, my backpack. My most recent obsession has been with Amigurumi. The photos of the little crochet dolls were so cute I had to purchase the Japanese books even though I couldn't read the directions. I was on the verge of giving up when I purchased this book. It helped me figure out every stitch!! I couldn't believe it when I finished my first project. I made 4 more in a week and gave them all away as gifts. Everything I have needed so far has been in this book. It's explanations are easy to understand and the index helps you look up anything you need. I haven't come across anything yet that wasn't answered in this little book.My only regret was not purchasing this book when I first began teaching myself to crochet!"
3,Crochet Book,"My grandma gave me this book. I am impressed by how much content is in this book. There are pages and pages of good content.However, I am disappointed because the text and book are so small. If you do not like small print, I do not recommend this book.I recommend purchasing something with larger print and less content. The amount of content in this book is slightly overwhelming."
5,A great resource for any avid crocheter!,"I found this book well researched and very helpful for both beginners to advanced crocheters. It answers a lot of the little and the bigger crochet questions people have when they want to get it right, plus it has so many extra features, like hook size charts and information, the new yarn classification system, how to read international stitch charts, it explains fabric care symbols etc. I actually read it from cover to cover, and now I keep it in my bag to refer back to. It's a must get for my crochet students too!"
4,What to do,I purchased this book as a reference. I would rate myself as a crochet beginner and always have questions. This book has answered each as they popped up. Already paid for itself in gas savings to my usual Q&A location.
4,Helpful book,Good book. Clearly written. Answers most questions. It would be better if it was spiral-bound to make it easier to hold open to the page of interest.
4,Very Good,I just started crocheting and I love this book. It is very easy to understand and the pictures are great and illustrate the different stitches so i can follow them easily. I highly recommend this book!!
5,A Great Resource,This book tucks about anywhere and answers all questions that arise on how to and what is it. I keep it with my current project and have used it on a steady basis.
4,The Crochet Answer Book is helplful,"This is a very good book for crocheters like me who tend to forget certain things between projects. It covers many aspects of crocheting and has many, many diagrams which is very helpful to me."
4,Will There Be More . . .,"... from this talented quintet? Start with longtime playing partners (and Grisman alumni) Darol Anger and Mike Marshall, add a dash of guitar-master David Grier, pour on Tony Trishka's scintillating banjo stylings, and wrap it up with Todd Phillps' ""spacey/solid"" bass, and voila! an instant near-classic jam album. The compositions all come from the various band members (with the notable exception of Jimi Hendrix's ""3rd Stone from the Sun, which is pretty high energy but somehow misses the mark) and lay out some wonderful melodic foundation - Marshall's ""Hot Nickels"" and Trishka's ""Garlic & Sapphires"" are my personal favorites, but almost every track is a keeper. The unsung hero of this effort may be Todd Phillips, who shifts from timekeeper to timewarper and back on numerous occasions without missing a beat. All of these guys have their own gigs, but I'd love to hear a followup!"

1,Hernia Inducing Cat Litter,"I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best ""bang for the buck"" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing. What the heck? Turns out both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!"
5,Improved my golf game!,"This book has been excellent for my game. Now that I am following Mr. Price's workout, my level of play has really improved. I highly recommend it to any golfer!"
2,Weight training for X,This is a generic weight training book written for no sport in general and they have published several versions of the book and simply changed the title page.
5,Just what I wanted,I was looking for a book that actually had workout routines to specifically target areas that would increase my golf game and this one had it. It also has pre-season and off-season workouts which are a plus. It is a very detailed book. Great book!
2,NOT a golf training book,"This is an OK book for general weight training, but it is NOT specific to golf. In fact, the word golf does not even appear after page 7. There are sections that refer to running faster and jumping higher - not exactly skills needed for golf. It really looks like they change the first few pages for a specific sport, but use the remainder of the book for any sport. And even the general weight training sections are pretty ho-hum. Granted, I've been weight training for a lot of years, so this info might be useful for someone just starting out. But it is definitely not specific to golf."
3,OK... Nothing really of note to learn in this book,"This book gives a general workout plan with more or less standard weight lifting fare... squats, bench, curls, etc etc. There is really very little here that is golf-specific, or really any different than any other weight lifting book you see. It's well written and clearly explains the exercises. But in general it did not really push into any new territory."
5,Classic Sam Bush,"Often called ""The world's greatest mandolinist"", Sam lives up to the title in a CD as diverse as his own talents. From funk to a nostalgia piece, this represents his best solo work, since Newgrass Revival, and I have been a fan since he was a teenager."
5,wow,This guy is awesome. I could do without the vocals on some of the songs. The purely instrumental songs are fascinating.
2,Handle issues,"I've had to buy 4 of these so far in a couple of years, as replacements for my husband's espresso machine. The problem is that the handles seem to break easily, while we're simply trying to clean the carafes."
1,cheaply made,It is impossible to purchase these in the store. This is the second time I have had to order one from Amazon. The quality is extremely poor. The handle broke away from the carafe and it is impossible to use it without the top. Krups used to be know for quality now I suggest to look for another brand for espresso!
3,A little different,"I have an older model recently the glass carafe broke so ordered a new one. It does not lock into the coffee spout like the old one, it still works but you must place it exactly where you want it and not move it while it is brewing."
1,The handlle,"We are sooo disappointed! We have used Krups products for over twenty years and have never had produce perform so poorly. We thought we had just received a faulty carafe with our new espresso maker. But NO, when we ordered a new one it was the same. The handle keeps coming loose and turning when trying to use or clean. The handle will not stay tightened.Also having the lid attached is a real draw back as you cannot clean it as well Go back to your old style, at least it lasted ten years before we broke it by dropping., Yours did not last even two weeks before the handle brook off. My husband and I are now thinking of trying to find another machine by another maker. Also having trouble with the steamer, does not work as well.I guess we have to purchase a life time of carafes!"
1,"Fragile Carafe,Good Coffee maker","I have the same problem that these customers had. This carafe does not represents the coffee maker, as same is a very good one. The manufacturers of Krups have to look into this problem because people would not want to buy the coffee maker because of its poor expresso carafe. I have to buy one because I need it, and my expresso-coffee maker does not look the same, without it. I regret buying the machine."
5,Y-Town's back and better then ever!!,"It's about time they made a comeback! their new song is soo kewl! and the video is kewl, and in the vid. when they're actin like blink-182 in the All The Small Things video, it's funny. I don't like blink-182 too much, but it's funny and Sammy is lookin cuter then he did before so is D.C. **KTYPA**"
4,Still captivating,"It seems like lots of folks were let down by changes in the cast, this really wasn't the case for me. I'm still captivated by the Spartacus series and all its gory glory. I watched the entire second season in one day, as I just couldn't stop watching. Lots of twists and turns, and outrageous action. All in all, this season picks up nicely where the other left off."
2,Not such a good Season,"Granted no one can bring back some of the previous key players but this season left us with, wow, bloody fights and nudity. Writing seems to have been a secondary kind of thought eh? Pretty disappointed and would not buy again.thanks for nothing o Spartacus team..JR"
5,Awesome!,"I absolutely love these types of movies/series. I have the whole collection so far. If you like these kind of series/movies, you'll like this series and be hooked on them. I don't know why people are so judgmental and such critics about these things. If you like it, you like it, if you don't, you don't. Just because certain people are such ""critics"" doesn't mean it's not for you. I know if I went by what a lot of other people post on items, that I wouldn't get to experience things for myself. Plus, I know what I like."
5,Still the best show out right now,"First of all I can say the new actor did a pretty good job as Spartacus, as far as his acting, but the absense of the original, Andy Whitfield, is definitley missed. They share some similarity in appearance with the biggest discrepancy being their physique. The new Spartacus is fairly small and weak looking, but he pulls off the character well pretty. It's good to see most of the other main characters return. Spartacus is still an awesome show with lots of action and drama. Sometimes they go a little overboard with the blood. For example, someone gets headbutted or a minor cut with a sword and a gallon of blood comes flying out. I'd rather see it a little more realistic, but then again this is an over-the-top show. If you liked the first season and the prequel, it's a no brainer you need to see this complete second season. Now I have another long wait until the next season!"
1,empty,I received an empty DVD case with no cds in it. The rating would have been much higher if I would have actually been able to watch what I purchased.
3,Spartacus: Venegeance - The Complete Second Season,"I watched Gods of the Arena, the prequel and Blood and Sand, the first season at least three times each and every time I watched it I learned something new and was more interesting every time I watched it. Also, Andy Whitfield and original cast had a tremedous amount of charisma, the story line was extremely interesting and emotional. We losted Spartacus and Quintus Battiatus in one season-a virtual double whammy. The death of Mr. Whitfield was a huge loss to the world and to this mini series; one that may not be able to be filled. I wish the new cast a lot of luck, but it is a near impossible act to follow. Therefore, relatively speaking the first several episodes of the the second season are somewhat disappointing, but I am hoping it will get more interesting as it develops and unfolds into the complete story."
1,The new spartacus does not fit the role and upstaged by his costars,"I could not believe that they cast Liam McIntyre as Spartacus. The producers have lost a loyal viewer and I really wanted them to find someone to fill the first Spartacus's shoes. In my opinion, they simply looked for someone that resembled Andy Whitfield. I don't think Mcintyre was able to carry the role physically and as an actor, and I felt he was upstaged by his costars. Its unfortunate that the talent pool was so limited that this was the guy they chose. :( dont buy the season."
5,gladiators of the arenaoso,"Spartacus; Meant my expectations too the up most high. This series caught my attention,and im proud to say that i own all of it on blu-ray dvd im waiting for season 3 to come out and from what i read about spartacus it's going to end in january 2013. I can't get enough of spartacus the women are sexy and the men are loaded with high levels of testosterone. andy whitfield is sadly missed by family friends and fans. If there is a after life then spartacus he is. No man can do his role so liam has to try too fill his shoes to finish this AWSOME SERIES!!! GOD BLESS YOU ANDY A TRUE GLADIATOR!!!! G. philadelphia pa."
5,Absolutely Fantastic !,"This series from the beginning is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC ! It's raw, imaginative, look back at a time in history filled with all passion, blood, sex and intense human emotions. Its filled with action, exotic sexuality and villians...."
3,Product is Good,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with the product or the condition in which the product arrived to me in the mail. My only warning is to Spartacus fans out there. Season 1 was fantastic. Season 2 is just nothing in comparison. It's pretty easy to see the plot twists coming, the plot is very simple, and the main actor who now plays Spartacus looks, sounds, and acts rather differently from the original and it was hard to adjust to him. Personally, if you're a Spartacus fan, stick with just the first season and call it quits."
5,love the dvd's,"I like all the series so for, And will be adding the 4th set when they come out, It is a lot like our government today, a lot of under the table deals and setups, one-ups manship. which does little to help the masses."
5,I think Andy Whitfield would be very proud of this Season of Spartacus,I found this season of Spartacus Vengeance fascinating for these reasons: very strong performances from all the cast members who are great actors in their own right. I very much loved Andy Whitfield and was so hurt and disappointed when he died. I had serious doubts about whether any further episodes would be able to hold my attention. I was thankfully wrong. Liam Mcintyre is not Andy but I feel he did this job to the best of his ability. He had a very heavy burden to carry. I feel the entire cast gave performances worthy of Oscar nominations. I'm trying to figure out how the writers are going to top this season in what is supposed to be the last with season 3. I look forward to War of the Damned. I recommend adding this DVD to your Spartacus collection.
3,Worth a look,"This series is interesting but not near as much ""eye popping"" fun as the other two Spartacus series. Lawless seems a little listless in her resurrection."
5,Reveting,My husband and I truly enjoyed this season of Spartacus. We watched it about three times We loved it. Can't wait for the next season.
5,Love it more!,Better than first season and still a great storyline.Very entertaining in every way wish they would not stop at four.
5,"Sparticus, second season",This product was just as advertised. Enjoyed the story as well asthe extra footage about the action and actors. It is well done.
5,Nice Blu-ray!,"Very nice Blu-ray with good sound and picture. The extra features were nice, as well as the ability to watch extended episodes easily. Good buy."
5,Best Show Ever!,"Simply Put ...The Best Show Ever Made!!!Sucks this is gonna be the last season.Spartacus, gannicus ,and crixus are epic characters!"
3,The Series is Good......Except.....,"I have only two problems with the Spartacus Series; It is a well made and realistic (Time Period) drama....except......I'm not sure that the Romans used the F--- Word this much; I stand to be corrected, no problem if I am wrong; It seems to me to be totally unnecessary to constantly say this.....It's like the character is selling drugs on a rough side of town. It really ruins the whole Movie/Show to continually be F-Bombed to oblivion. When I bought this Item, it was very cheap; So cheap I couldn't pass it up; I only watched it once, but it appears the 3rd DVD is scratched in spots, so much so: that a used DVD store won't take it; It was sealed, so either it was sent damaged, or the VERY POOR packaging has caused it; It doesn't seem like a good idea to slide a DVD across cardboard (Especially if you paid list price)."
5,Spartacus: Vengeance,"I actually don't like Spartacus, but my husband LOVES it. That's probably true of most married couples. It arrived quickly and was in excellent condition. Thanks!"
5,Just awesome,"The product arrived fast. The price was excellent. It came just in time for my husband's birthday.We don't have Starz, so we hadn't seen this season yet. But if you loved the first season, you must have this blu ray. It's beautiful. The colors, the clarity, the action scenes--spectacular. I would actually recommend investing in a four disk blu-ray set when the final season is released.As for the actual contents of this season, it's epic and poetic, but nothing compares to Andy Whitfield's performance in season 1. I believe the writers anticipated this, because this third season isn't entirely focused on Spartacus. You'll still LOVE it though, so do buy, or wait for the 4 pack."
3,wasn't thrilled with the recasting,"I wasn't thrilled with the recasting of a few of the players. Liam McIntyre especially didn't seem to have the presence that Andy Whitfield had, rest his soul. While the script in the previous seasons was stylized to give the show an older feeling, it really felt that they went overboard this season, making it much harder to catch all the lines and what was being said."
2,Sadly wish they didnt do this season,Zero season and season 1 should have been left where it was. since the main actor of season one sadly had real like problem that kept him from continue should have just ended the series from there surprisingly season zero (or season 2) turned out quite well. But to replace the star and continue ended badly as usually happens. Didnt like this season. Got bored with it quickly.
3,Not as well done as previous effort,I was not able to watch the segments on TV because of non-availability. I did purchase Vengence to continue watching the story. I did like what I saw and will probably purchase the final offering.
2,"The actor lacks of a essential notion of acting, giving life to the charater!","The actor that starz chose to substitute Andy whitfield does not have the same talent for acting, the series lost great quality in that, and if it wasnt for Crixus, it wouldnt even be worth it to keep watching!Better put more struggle on your skills Liam McIntyre."
5,Great series!!,"This is one of my favorite series on television. Even though it is not the original Spartacus from season 1, may he rest in peace, it was still very good under the circumstances"
2,The Decline....,"This is what happens when you take an edgy, well written and well acted show and turn it into a 'b' or even 'c' type series... toss in more fighting, toss in porn like sex (at least in the first season, there seemed to be a reason), and hope that the viewers will be distracted enough to not notice that the storylines have gotten weaker and more drawn out, that the dialog has become somewhat goofy, that the fight choreography is more quick kill then battle, that the acting seems 'anxious'.... Yes, Andy Whitfield is certainly missed, moreso as it seems like after his death, everyone associated with the show seems to have lost their enthusiasm and is now just going through the motions to meet a deadline instead of put a really fantastic show/story together..."
5,"Blood, Guts, Sex, Violence and Bad Language Oh My!","I absolutely LOVED the first season of Spartacus, LOVED IT! My wife and I smoked through the first season box set like a wood chipper on crack! The second season will not disappoint the fans either. It's a shame the lead actor (Spartacus) passed due to cancer and couldn't shoot season two. He will be missed, he nailed the role perfectly. That being said his replacement made the transition seem near seamless. It certainly could have been a lot worse.I didn't feel as invested in season two as season one, but that is nit picking. I still tore through the box set in two days and would have been happy with ten more episodes.Worth every penny."
5,The NEW Spartacus rocks,"Like most feedback here, I really like the 2nd season and the new Spartacus actor really stepped out to the plate and it is doing a great job.The story is great, the battle scenes are even better in this season, the roman society and their way of living and how they behave are amazing to see and the SFX are even better than season 1.Is a great series definetely worth having the DVD/ Blu Ray collection.The Romans really knew how to party :-)"
3,There will be blood,Great pick up after the tragic loss of there lead actor to cancer. Many twists and turns that lead you to the ending of the season.
4,Buy it,"I wasn't going to buy this series cause I was pretty bummed that Andy Whitfield died and he did such a great job, I didn't think they could replace him. Well, they didn't but this series is still very well done and after you get over the fact that it's not Andy you'll enjoy it."
4,blood and guts,"This is a very good series, good story and characters that you care about. Also lots of killings and sex."
5,Not bad...not bad at all...,"I've seen (in chronological order) Gods of the Arena and Blood and Sand. Both are very similiar in style and setting...one gets used to the small world of the ludus and the arena in Capua. However this is much different as it's all around Capua with very little of the main characters in the ludus (no spoiler alert). Seeing a different actor play Spartacus is a little hard at first, but you get used to it quick - Liam McIntyre is a pretty badass Spartacus. Nothing against Andy Whitfield (B&S;) - he was great, but unfortunately he died. Literally. Still a great cast, great production, great scenes! Highly recommend the ENTIRE series, from Gods through the upcoming War of the Damned. Starz did a GREAT job with this!Still very violent and sexual. Kinda miss some of the other characters...they were great.Enjoy!"
5,It was amazing and this is what i was waiting to see for a long time ..,I still miss the old Spartacus .. but it was amazing and its worth watching .. looking forward the final chapter to be released .. as we in UAE are not able to view the episodes which is quite sad ..
4,2ND SEASON,Exciting and not in the least predictable. Great job all around. Can't wait for the third season to see where this series goes.
2,Not Good This Time,"The first season and the prequel were great. Vengeance was weak. The character of Spartacus was poorly cast, and it didn't help having the storyline they wrote for him. The guy's all of a sudden changed to a politician, giving speeches every episode to a disorganized horde to stop them from destroying each other, followed by, ""Yeeeaaaahhhh!!!"" Lots of times the story gets goofy and unbelievable. The new Naevia isn't good either.The thing that made Spartacus work before was Batiatus. Without him, and combined with the loss of Andy Whitfield, it's just over. I understand that if the story were to continue any further, the story of the ludus and the arena needed to end. But the current cast of characters, without a great lead actor or two, and the lack of good writing to make up for it has ruined the show. And with the people who were killed off at the end of Vengeance, it makes the next and final season seem like there's absolutely no hope for an ending worth watching."
3,Pathetic attempt at keeping the series alive EH..,"When I learned Andy Whitfield died I initially thought this series was doomed. To my surprise, the second season ""God's of the Arena"" was great! almost as good as the first season. I was really looking forward to Vengence cause the writing of the second season was very cleaver. I don't think writing can save this show. I realized the reason season2 was so good was because of Quintes Batiatus. He's gone now, and the new Spartacus is not fit for the role. Even Crixus has ""dumbed down"" to his level. Physically the new Spartacus doesn't look like he can win against any slave in his entourage. He's just not believable. They even had to change Neavia. I would have much rather prefered they let Spartacus die and let the series focus around Crixus and Ganacus. It's just ok"
4,Good and Bad in all situations,"Andy was not very strong as Spartacus, and I longed for a real atheletic,fierce person to play that role;however, this new guy is not the answer. John Hannah made the show and should have never died so soon. It should have been a dream with Sparticus waking realizing his attempt would come up short. If you are an athelete with an above average build you look for certain things that you would do or could do if given the opportunity. I know I'm a harsh critic to most, but Andy was not very atheletic, nor was he built like a superior being. If Krixus did not look like such a brute, he could fill half the role. I hope they can find a way to bring John back. As for as this new season, I will give it a chance by watching several times before my final review. Lesley is better than the new actress."
2,more than just kinda dull....,"Aside from the new Spartacus, who's acting is not that good, and his all too innocent, pathetic looking eyes, which are not suited to his role, his eyes lack the passion and determination that the tragic Whitfield had. The storyline was slow, dull, and not worthy of a second season.I loved the prequel and the first season, great storylines and intriguing characters. The characters in season two are quite simply dull.Lucy Lawless does an astonishing job, her talent was the only thing that kept me watching, and sadly is the only redeeming quality in a series that was once so eye-openingly brilliant.I rated this as a 2 stars only because I enjoy Imperial Roman genres and for the quality of Lucy Lawless's performances."
2,Not even close to the 1st two seasons,"There is little depth or intrigue in this season as it largely is just fighting and sex scenes. The first season had fighting and sex scenes, but they fit well within the story. I think the main flaw in this season is that it is not character-driven. It's all about winning victory over the Romans - so they focus on fighting - but there is no real reason why the audience should care who wins. I didn't feel emotionally attached to any of the characters and felt disconnected from the entire season.Preseason and 1st season - excellent - they were character focused with a particular focus on the rise of Batiatus - not just on fighting.This season was horrible. I'd only plan to watch the next season if I can watch it for free and I'm very bored."
5,My Other Brother Loves This Type of Movie,I bought this for another brother for Christmas because he loves King Arthur type movies and he'll really love this series! This was an excellent value for everything you get.
4,He seeks only vengeance,"Im keeping it short and hope that someone who created spartacus reads and takes this into consideration. I loved the 2nd ( 3rd ) season hands down. 2 problems I had, why the original nivea wasnt used was a big disappointment. The lady playing her now is awful. That ruined it for me, shes a bad actress and nowhere near how pretty other nivea was. Most importantly, take your hand off the slow motion button. Please it was just too much slow motion in this season. Almost every swing or stab was slowed down. I pray they dont do that again in the next and final season. But if they do, im still going to watch lol"
5,Great play on History,Shows the roman times as lusty as we have be led to believe. Enjoyed every minute and recommend watching very carefully or you will miss something.
5,Completes the set!,"I was concerned about the new lead being able to pull this off, but. He did well! It was also nice to see life after freedom for the slaves."
5,Another great season of Sparacus action!,My wife and I were both wondering how the season could possibly continue after the fall of the Batiatus Ludus. The writers did a great job keeping us glued to the series. We can't watch the show week to week so we just get the BluRays and make a marathon of the season. One weekend and this set was complete. Now we are anxiously awaiting the release of War of the Damned after the season is completed.
2,Didn't fit me right,"Very cute sandle, but the toe strap cut in too far between my toes. Too painful to wear."
2,What with the toe strap?,"Sadly, I must agree with the other reviews and say the toe strap just isn't right!These are so cute and potentially comfortable but, you can't get past that toe strap issue. The moment I put them on it started cutting into my toe. I was so disappointed!Oh well... don't waste your time on these. Hopefully they'll fix the problem for Summer 2009."
3,SUPER CUTE,These shoes are super cute but the straps are made too tightly and I have really skinny feet. Hopefully they'll wear out when I break them in.
5,My Childhood,"I still remember this episode giving me nightmares about skeletons as a child. I thought it was SO SCARY. :) Now that I've watched it again, it's become one of my favorite MST3K episodes. The riffing is all funny, and I also actually like the movie. In its weird campy, melodramatic way, it's pretty fun. Also, I absolutely love the interstitial skits (try saying that three times fast) on this one.Even if it isn't a nostalgia trip for you like it is for me, I think this one is worth at least a watch-through."
1,Stay away from this Radians Enhance ear hearing unit,"I just got the Radians Enhance ear electronic hearing protection (2units)don't waste you time or money, the ones I got didn't work, when I say they didn't work they wouldn't even turn on. All the controls are to small to work and the batties are hard to get in because of the smallest. They are on the way back to Amazon as I write this. We will see how goog there return department is.They wouldn't finsh my opinion until I put a rate for this item I had to put one star, but that's not true, it shoul be no star."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"Lonely PLanet makes fine books but this is NOT one of them. I have toured the island several times and apparently the author and I have not been to the same places. Or rather the writer merely went as far as the nearest tourist office and copied the local brochures. I found his descriptions of all of the historical sites inaccurate -- museums the size of 10 x 10 room are described as ""large"" and worth half a day; sites are described as ""near the village"" when they are right in the middle -- hence the author was never there. The language glossary doesn't even include ""Please, Thank You or Excuse Me.""BUY another Cyprus book"
1,Yawn,"I expected a ""Lonely Planet"" guide to help me explore off the beaten track, but I found this book too bland and long-winded to use. Some of the information is useful, but some is out of date. The ""Eye Witness Top Ten Cyprus"" suited me better to help me explore the beauty and appeal of Cyprus."
3,"Not ""season 10""","Midsomer murders is a wonderful series and gets 5 stars. Video on Demand gets only three stars because this Set 13 and 14 of the series. The only clue, which I failed to notice until after purchase, was the small tag in the upper left corner of the picture. Here's hoping you do not make the same mistake in trying to complete the collection with a digital vs. hard copy. Set 6 on VOD is correct."
4,It all comes together....,"This album, by one of the best guitarists in the world, is a magnificent demonstration of why music styles don't always have to be in separate and distinct categories. I've been a Doc fan since I was a young teenager. I love his skill and the old bluegrass and country tunes, not to mention Doc's unique style onstage. However, in Docabilly, we hear the master playing early rock and roll. Just listen to the fun he has doing a glorious interpretation of Chuck Berry's guitar in Shake, Rattle and Roll. Hey plays Elvis, the Everly Brothers, Johnny Cash, and makes all the songs his own. Even though this isn't my favorite Doc album, I wouldn't want to be without it!"
5,reliable,Purchased this for my son who is into wrestling and needs precise and accurate readings. This has done just that. Recommend this
5,Excellent scale,This is the best scale that I have owned. It appears to be identical to the scale that was used in Weight Watchers meetings. I would certainly recommend it.
2,Poor quality,"I already returned two of these, out of the box, first one said error, never worked. I was sent a new one and it worked very well for about two months, then it started displaying erratically different weights at startup. Then it would zero out and then display error. It has a year warranty so I was told they would replace it with a new one, but I had to pay return shipping. Customer service originally told me it sounded like it needed calibration and sent me instructions to set four hundred lbs of weights on it. I took it to the gym but could find weights to fit, on the platform, so they said just return it so I did. No I'm waiting. Other than that it was pretty accurate but the plastic display part of the scale it really cheap plastic. Originally I wanted a tanita which I use at the gym, which has been there a few years, gets constant use and is built like an iron army tank, so I should have gotten the Tanita, but they were more expensive. Guess you get what you pay for."
4,Great Figures Hilariously Humbled Says It All.,"Will Cuppy had a gentle way of poking fun at legendary historical figures that made them appear unexpectedly human.And his research was impeccable.In a simple sentence he could make fun of not only Alexander the Great, but the historians who were in total awe of the conqueror. ""In no time at all Alexander had killed Medes, Persians, Pisidians, Cappadocians, Paphlagonians, and miscellaneous Mesopotanians."" Here Cuppy inserts a footnote quoting the historian, F.A. Wright:""""He boldly proclaimed the brotherhood of man"".In seven chapters he lampoons Cleopatra, Attila, Charlemagne Catherine the Great, Frederick the Great,King George III, Columbus, Montezuma, and many others.For anyone who has to learn history anyway, it's a great way to do it - laughing."
1,Decline,"Spider Robinson recommended this book in his book 'The Free Lunch' as a funny take on history. Mr. Cuppy's book was free with only shipping and handling and I can see why. Mr. Cuppy, per the introduction, was a monomania recluse in New York City. His life's work was trivializing and sneering at historically significant figures. His book contains a wealth of trivia that stripped of Mr. Cuppy's sneering might have been interesting. Neither version would be considered funny.I am sorry to admit that I didn't finish the book. I got as far as Lady Gadiva and threw it into paper recycling."
2,Some sketches of historical figures.,"This book was published back in 1950 and is a collection of humorous sketches of historical figures. Cuppy's presentation of humor leaves a lot to be desired. He makes a joke of some of the great figures of history, but since most of the jokes are dated, I laughed little. I wonder why a publisher would reprint a book that was so dated it would appeal to few people. I read this book for the purpose of trying to either learn something or laugh, and I didn't do either.For those who know something about history, this would not be a good read since it is neither humorous or factional. For those who know little of history, this book would be a disaster."
3,"occasionally funny, but often not","This book makes fun of historical figures from the dawn of civilization to the 18th century. Some of the book's wisecracks are very funny; however, I was disappointed more often than not."
4,Getting Started in Storytelling,"Pellowski suggests a number of settings in which young people might become involved in storytelling. She offers tips for selecting and preparing the story, recognizing that different methods of preparation might work best for different stories and/or different performers. Twenty-three stories are included."
1,TERRIBLE product,"I purchased this emachines through Best Buy 1 1/2 yrs ago. I have had many computers in my lifetime and this one has been the most disappointing to me. The motherboard shorted out/blew the other day and now I am left with a piece of junk. After talking to many people I work with, I find out I am not the only one with issues exactly as this one. Now I am completely out of luck and the $500 I spent! I will never purchase an emachines again! Yesterday, I ordered a Dell, let's see how that one behaves!Luckily, customer service is nice, but they didn't fix this computer!"
3,Its Ok,This is an ok tribute to Chalino. I like the Chalino jamm #5 its good! Other than that the rest of these jamms sound like your local cantina group.
2,"More ""tips"" than recipes","The book is ok, but the recipes seem like they are really just cooking tips rather than real recipes. One so-called recipe is just substituting ground turkey for beef with canned Sloppy Joe mix! Another ""recipe"" is just pouring jarred sweet and sour sauce over chicken. TaDa! It may taste good, but how exactly is that a healthy recipe?Also the meals are divided into categories like: 5 minute, 15 minute, 30 minute, and breakfast and appetizers. There is not section for just Dinner or even Entrees. Since the only meal most of us cook every day is dinner it seemed strange not to have a dinner section.There is nothing really wrong with the book but it's just common sense. I didn't find anything new or interesting. There are many free recipes online that could provide the same information. Save yourself the cost of the book and do a search for recipes web sites."
4,Likety-Split Meals,This was well informed book. It was very easy to follow. And the food I tried to make turned out great!
4,Another cookbook,"Delivery very fast. Good price. The cookbook itself is ok for our liking. More than just a cookbook with lots of tips for healthy eating and time savers. Although lots of great ideas, not sure how many of the meals I'll actually make because of my food restrictions as well. Bought mostly for my high school daughter and like the snack suggestions."
5,"quick. easy, and weight loss!","Tasty meals with real ingredients found in ordinary fridges! There is enough variety to create a month's worth of meals, and they are healthy. Both my husband and I lost weight without even trying.Definitely worth having."
3,Not the best - not the worst,...I find the recipes confusing because she includes side dish ingredients in the list of ingredients (so I have to check what actually goes in the main dish as opposed to the side dishes if I don't happen to be thrilled with a preset menu). The dishes I have made have been good but the book loses points with me for ease of use.
5,A Must-Have For Every Kitchen!,"This is by far the best cookbook I have ever owned! Every single page is written clearly with step by step directions for everything including any desserts or side dishes you may be serving. All recipes complete with nutritional information and serving sizes, and are all low-fat, low-sodium. My husband HATES anything remotely healthy including vegetables but he eats everything I have made from this book and actually likes it! Zonya does not use chemical sweeteners or exotic ingredients that take forever to find and prepare, this cookbook is made for those who need a fast, simple solution to healthy eating. These recipes are also easily tailored for vegetarians or vegans with tips from her on how to best prepare your tofu instead of meat. From now on this is the one book I recommend to every person I know!"
3,Layout makes book difficult to use,"This book has several interesting recipes, along with several good ideas for quick snacks--you know, the really simple ones you see and keep meaning to write down somewhere.So why only three stars? Awful writing style and layout. Several pages with maybe one tip and lots of empty space, and many recipes could also have been written two to a page if they were written the way most recipes are, e.g. ""1/4 pound pork tenderloin, cubed""; NOT ""1/4 pound pork tenderloin"", with the instruction ""cut meat into 1/2"" cubes"" off to the side.Also annoying are the ads for other products the author is selling, and a reliance on convenience foods and ""light"" versions of things like Miracle Whip which contain a lot of artificial ingredients.Decent book, but buy used. The binding and layout make the book look more substantial than it is."
3,Sunshine Carrot-Rasin Salad,"Our family loves the Sunshine Carrot-Rasin Salad recepie in this book. We eat healthier because of the recepies we use in the book. I have one major gripe about the book however. Try finding the recepie for carrot salad in the index when you don't remember that it is ""Sunshine"" AHHHHHH! Other rediculous titles of recepies include ""Zippy Zonya Mexi Mix"", ""Tantalizing Turkey Loaf Dinner"" ""Surprise Pumpkin Pie"" ""Quick Chicken Sandwich"" and ""Delicate Baked Fish"" There is no other way to look up the recepie, so if I forget the title of the recepie, I have to search the entire index. Overall, This is a great cookbook and I really do recommend it. Note to Zonya. Please fix the titles or the classification system for your next edition."
5,"It's a cookbook, grocery guide, health-fitness advisor!","The health-fitness content of this work is wonderful ... truly a practical-scholarly edition for your kitchen countertop. The packaging of the book intrigued me as I am a publisher - the book folds out and can stand upright, folds flat on its spiral binder, and the page layouts feature eye catching titles, subtitles, humor, and graphics which allow the reader to easily visualize the food ideas. My high compliments to Vicki Grucz, graphic designer and the author who now have a 2nd Edition Work which sets new standards for a health-conscious America!Karl W. Grube, Ph.D., Editor of GBG"
1,Do not buy if you have any experience in the kitchen,"I got this book because my husband and I want to be more health conscious when cooking. I also read the previous reviews and thought I would find some good recipes in here. NOT!!! I mean some of these recipes are not even recipes. Like the quick snack of cutting up some apples or the crab dip that is cream cheese, cocktail sauce and crabmeat. The 1 minute mini meals are a joke. The actual meals are not very imaginative at all. One is to put chicken and fresh veggies in foil and grill. I was very disappointed. This was all stuff I have already done. Thought they would be more healthly..Sodium is high on many of the full meals. Would NOT recommend to anyone."
2,not what I expected,The book is more than a little used and there are several pages missing. Overall I am disappointed in it.
2,Lickity split but not very tasty.,Ho Hum. Just another cookbook to put on the shelf and not use or give to Goodwill.
1,used book,"This isn't a review of the content of the book, but of the condition of the book when it arrived. There were food stains on several pages, it had obviously been used. There was no problem with the return."
4,lost order,I ordered this book several weeks ago. Was my check lost in the mail? Did you receive my order? Thank you for checking. Theresa Johns tjfbf@aol.com
3,An Easy Read But A Bit Disjointed,"This is a fun book that can appeal to light readers. Bill Goldberg comes accross as a basically likeable guy who shoots straight from the hip. However, the sequencing of the book is a bit shelter skelter as it starts off in the middle of his wrestling career, then cuts back to the football/wrestling transition period, fast forwards through his two or three eyars in the business and then goes back to his childhood and football career.Its nice that Bill Goldberg has a humble attitude and is gracious for what he has experienced being in the limelight. Also, his charitable work and touching comments about others who have faced adversy show he has a good heart. He gives some good accounts of his relationship with other wrestlers although some depth would be nice. Some of his language is a little bit questionable but like I said light readers and wrestling fans will definitely appreciate this account a true super hero."
2,MinnesotaWreckingCrew,"If you are a fan of Bill Goldberg, more than a wrestling fan, read this book. You will probably enjoy his biography. However, if you are a wrestling fan, more than a Bill Goldberg fan, you may not want to bother with this one. You can get a (used) copy from Amazon for less than $2.00. Doesn't that say a lot?"
5,Goldberg enters the pantheon of great American authors,"In his compelling work, ""I'm Next"", Goldberg challenges the intertextuality of the American ""hero"" and calls into question the very hierarchy of capitalistic patriarchal cultural values. For Goldberg, the American hero is a composite figure of multiple ""histories."" Once these histories intersect, a composite image of sweat, bodily secretions, and black knee pads reveals a character both tender and savage.Any reader who seriously tackles the great works of contemporary culture must read this manifesto of bald-headed autobiographical narration."
1,NOT FOR THE AVERAGE WRESTLING FAN,"Before I start, please be advised I have read the books of Mick Foley, Bret Heart, The Rock, D.D.P. and Arn Anderson. Without a doubt, this is the worst wrestling book I have ever read.It seems Bill Goldberg has had a cake walk through the ranks of Pro Wrestling. That's fine. The only disturbing thing about it is he brags about it, along with riding in his brother's jet or eating at one of his brother's resturants.He is high on every avenue he has be personally successful with, (his long winning streak, and low on everything that hasn't fallen his way, (professional football, turning heel, etc.) He speaks ill of Booker T. when he doesn't feel good about putting over Goldberg, then Goldie cries when he has to put Nash over.The hardcore Goldberg Fan might love his book. The average Wrestling Fan will prboably vomit!!!"
4,Golden Shower of Praise,"I was happy to read the story of Bill Goldberg. He is the sexiest pro wrestling star ever.Sure, it reads like a transcript of his talking, and jumps around in time, but that's okay. Not as ambitious as Mick Foley's or The Rock's. But I like Goldberg better, so I'm biased.I enjoy his no-nonsense approach in the ring. His achievements as a Jewish athlete are notable. His affection for his male friends is nice to read. His saucy gossip about the juicier aspects of his former teammates and other wrestlers was quite amusing, as were his decriptions of his body parts and their various injuries and inflammations. Ouch!Goldberg is a star missed in the ring. Hopefully he'll be in more actions films, showing more of his amazing physique!!"
1,Boring. Don't bother.,"Do not read this book. It's a waste of your time and very boring. There are better wrestling books out there. This is not one of them. Goldberg must have an ego the size of Texas to think we'd be interested in reading every friggin detail of his early life as a football player. I thought we were reading this to learn about his life as a pro-wrestler. Avoid, unless you have trouble sleeping."
3,Alittle disappointed...........,"Having read Mick Foley's book I was interested in how someone who is basically new to the sport views it. To say I was diappointed is an understatment. The book itself is well written and easy to read. We are take back to Goldberg's childhood and through his NFL career. In fact Goldberg spends most of the book writing about football and not enough on wrestling.I only hope that more seasoned wrestlers like: Kevin Nash,Luger, Sting and Ric Flair would give wrestling fans something to read about."
4,Good,This book is great. It came out in 2007 but only covers to about the time he returned from his injury. Oh well. Great read anyway.
4,Very Insightful & Interesting!,"I loved hearing the stories first-hand! It made it seem more alive. The pictures were fabulous! I will admit that I am not a football fan, so I was a little bored with so much football-talk. I enjoyed reading about how Bill's family felt about his decisions (profession, bald head, tattoo, etc.) I also enjoyed reading the comments from the other wrestlers. I loved the way Bill spoke so candidly about what the wrestlers privately say to each other during the matches that the fans don't hear. He also spoke about what goes on during the match that the fans wouldn't notice. It was very interesting and I couldn't help sharing tidbits of info with my family as I was reading! THANKS Bill!"
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,This book was not that good. It is hard to compare this book to a Betseller like Mick Foleys but I'll try. Goldbergs book talks about his football-power plant training-wcw wrestling-his advantages of being on TV (Superstardom and getting FREEBIES). This book stinks. Don't buy check it out at the Library.Foley's book delt with him working his way to the top from the bottom of wrestlng talks about going on the road with the GUYS.
5,Excellence,This is one of the best albums I have ever heard and I've heard plenty. This is pure country music and the recording production is excellent. All the performers are pros with huge backgrounds. The harmonies and musicianship are outstanding as well as the song selection. In the late sixities and through the seventies Country Western music rose to a new level of quality. This is that wonderful C/W sound that started to go away with the commercial crap and cookie cutter acts coming out of corporate Nashville.
2,beware!!!,"Beware that this item comes without a cord, so if you are like my boyfriend who lost the whole thing, why would you want to buy a stand that you can't plug into the wall? Also if you go on small appliances website they are giving another stand there that fits braun 7526, that is a little more expensive, and this one supposedly only fits two models (the numbers are available on amazon.com page of this item). So we can only trust Mr. Cooper who tagged this item as fit for 7526 model. By the way the cord will cost you another $18.99 +6.99 shipment, and there you are looking at $76.00, where if you add 30-40 $$ you can buy a new system on sale in CVS or somewhere else...!!! Think for yourselves people!!! I am dissappointed and I m going to send this item back, and I refuse to pay for the cord separately!!!"
5,Enlighten yourselves,People would do well by themselves to dig into how things in this country really work and this book will provide them with the chance.
4,Sort Of Like Russian Roullette,"I always keep a few bags of these at work and grab a handful whenever hunger strikes. Most of the people at work like them now as well. The uneven flavoring was at first a turn off but we have all learned to love it. We call it Russian Roulette because you never know when you are going to get that nose burning, eye watering hot one. That is half the fun anymore, the heat does not linger around too long and off you go finishing the handful.These are much better for everyone to keep around work then a box of slim jims or a jar of Sour Patch kids which is what we use to keep. I tend to get another case about once every other week anymore, the subscribe and save is definitely the way to go with these."
1,Defective Distribution of Wasabe-Choke inducing bites,"I have eaten hot wasabe spiced edamame many times before, eat hotter thai food than some of my Thai family members, and I enjoy hot food generally, and use more Wasabe on my sushi than any others I eat with. I ordered 12 packages of this edamame wasabi, and something clearly went wrong in production. One minute you will have a bite with moderate spicing, and the next you will have enough to want to spit out the nuts, guzzle water, and make you worry you have damaged your sinuses. I kid you not. The process of distribution of wasabe over the nuts is WILDY uneven with spikes best termed hazardous to your health!"
4,Delicious Snack,These things are great! I used to buy them in a local store but couldn't find them anymore but here they are! Crunchy with a wasabi kick!
4,Good and good for you!,"A good, flavorful and healthy snack you don't feel guilty munching on! You don't need much else but a bottle of water and these. They transport well and stay fresh"
1,Asbolutely awful,"We bought these for a healthy snack, and they are very healthy. The issue is that the wasabi seasoning is not evenly coated. So, you'll get some with no coating and then a few with tons of coating and it is incredibly strong. My husband eats pretty much anything and he won't even eat these...what a disappointment."
1,Uneven wasabi coating..,"I was glad that I was not the only one who felt that way seeing other 1 star reviews/comments here.I had many wasabi flavored snacks and enjoyed them.When I first open the package and eat couple of them, I liked it.And I ate few more somehow I took a breath and inhaled while I was eating it. It was the first time ever that I felt like I had to call 911. I tried to endure first but it became worse. My chest hurt so much and I thought I was going to die for couple minutes. It hurt my chest and lung area for 30 mins. I never wrote a product review before, but this time I was wondering how a company can distribute something like this.. I like roasted beans so I might try just lightly salted one, but with this one, I don't want to take any risk."
2,"Alas, I had such high hopes.","I bought these based on the nutritional information thinking they'd be like high-protein wasabi peas. I ignored the other reviewer's comment that the wasabi was unevenly distributed. Big mistake.The texture is pretty substandard compared to wasabi peas--they're a little bit cardboardy and they make my mouth feel dry. They also taste under-salted to me. But most of all, the unevenly distributed wasabi flavor means that one handful will taste like paper and the next will make you cry.I really wanted to like them. :("
4,Uneven seasoning on an otherwise GREAT snack.,"I absolutely LOVE these, when I get a bean that actually has wasabi seasoning on it. Unfortunately, the wasabi is rather hit or miss in the package. Like other Seapoint Farms products, there is a LOT of husk residue in the container. It appears that the wasabi is applied to the bean outer covering. In shipping, this outer part comes off and so does the wasabi. Perhaps if Seapoint Farms did a better job of cleaning the beans AND THEN applied the seasoning? While tasty, wasabi-flavored onion skins are not as thrilling as the prospect of wasabi-flavored edamame.A good product worth buying and a good product worthy of improving to make it a great product."
5,great snack for diabetics,"I have type-2 diabetes and need a crunchy, tangy snack that isn't high in carbs. Seapoint Farms wasabi edamame fill this bill perfectly: they are nutritious, satisfy hunger, have great taste and texture, and combine protein with carbs, which diabetics need. A very fine corn chip, potato chip or pretzel substitute for people with my condition."
3,"Hot, but not the best flavor","For a snack, these are just okay. They are, in my opinion, really hot. Burn your nose kind of hot. I like to put wasabi paste on my sushi and burn my nose a little, so I don't really have a complaint about the hotness, it's just not exactly the flavor I was expecting. Wasabe peas (not this product) seem to have the right flavor, but these dry roasted edamame just don't have it. And like the other reviewer said, it needs salt. Maybe that would help a little."
1,Not a great gift item,"The best advice re ordering this product: If you feel you must, and have not tried them before, buy one package--not the 12 pack. I can pretty much guarantee you will be happy you have only one pack to throw away and not 12 to give to unsuspecting family/friends--none of whom even came close to saying, ""Thank you."""
2,Too Hot To Handle,I usually love everything and anything Wasabi but not these. The first couple had no spice then the next one made my eyes water and my nose burn.Friends who I have given bags to cant tolerate the flames either.
2,its ok...,"taste blah. too spicy at times, like others mentioned it is uneven distributed. I am going to have to think of what to do with the rest 11 bags......."
3,Stupid Chain!,"For the price the diamond is nice, but don't buy based on the picture. The actual diamond is much smaller.I'm really pissed off at how tangled the chain came. It should have been packed better. At first I didn't even think the chain came because it wasn't in the little bag, but just thrown in the box. I almost wished I hadn't bought it because I can't seem to get the chain untangled. How much pricier would the chain be if they just invested in a better method of packaging? Not much I think."
1,This necklace is a rip-off. Dont waste your money like I did!!,"Dont buy this necklace. I purchased this necklace as a gift for my ritzy grandmother from my kids thinking it would be nice, yet inexpensive...I was wrong with both. Its too tiny, I thought for sure when I saw it that there must be some kind of mistake. ANd for the price I paid, I wouldnt pay $10 for this necklace. I would have returned it if I would have gotten in it with-in 30 days, but I am overseas with my family and another family memeber shipped it over here to us. So, I am out of luck with returning it...but dont buy this, NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Amazon has definetely deceived the customer with the picture of this necklace, should be on a model to see the actual size. Lesson learned and passed on!"
1,Tiny,"... its Tiny! Maybe I didn't read the fine print but this thing is TINY! The whole pendant is about half the size of my pinky nail. The chain, pendant, diamond, its all nice, but just be aware you're getting a very very small necklace."
3,"Good value, but the picture makes it look alot bigger.","I haven't given it to her yet, so I guess I can't tell you how good the necklace is. But it was a great deal. The picture is much bigger than the actual size. Pay attention to the dimensions."
1,Never been so DISAPPOINTED.,"WOW, i was so deceived by the picture. It was probably pictured with a a camera that zooms in as if you were looking into a microscopic lens. If I were you, I would look up a size chart before buying any jewelry online. It was my own fault that I didn't look it up.The diamond was so small that a single rice grain is probably a little larger than the diamond. And the chain that comes with it is probably the same size as a thin thread. This gift was supposed to be for my mother, but now I will give it to my baby sister since it fits more for children.I have never been so disappointed with my buys from Amazon, but I will probably not buy anymore jewelry online again. Lesson learned."
3,"tiny, not sure if it really worth buying,","yes, it looks like white gold, not sure why it is called princess-cut, unless princess-cut meant tiny. You should go for something more NOTICEABLE if it is for your serious girl friend."
1,"Super Small, Not as Pictured, Returned Mine","The diamond is extremely small and does not stand out like it does in the picture. Its appearance is similar to a necklace you get out of one of those machines with plastic eggs that have toy jewelry inside. When the necklace is worn, the diamond is barely noticeable because it is so small - it looks like you're just wearing a chain. The chain is very thin - I have never seen such a thin chain. It would be extremely helpful if the pics showed a model wearing the necklace so you could get an idea of what it really looks like. I returned this necklace because I will not be seen wearing it."
1,Don't thnk about this.,"The old addage that if it looks too good to be true it probably is applies here. When I opened the box I could not even see it at first! Whisper thin, the diamond no bigger than the head of a pin, when I lay it against my skin, it vanished. My fist reaction was ""they have to be kidding"". I returned it."
1,Super Tiny!!!,I was so disappointed when I received this necklace. What a waste of money. You need a maginfy glass just to see the diamond! DONT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!
1,"Not enough value for the Cost , The chain is to fragile, Amazon does not recognized their return policy","This product is very bad quality. the chain is very fragile. Iif it gets tangle, good luck getting it untangle. I returned this item for this reason. I do no think that I got a good value for my money. I returned the item within the 30 days return policy. Amazon received it on the 25 of January and I have not received my refund. Even though, Amazon.com has a statement online extending holiday purchase until January 31, 2010."
3,ITS JUST NOT WORTH IT!!!,"Well, this book mistakes 777's for 727's, and 747's for 777's, so I would have to say that only buy this book if neccisary, for school projects and such. It has no mention of Shuttle, and even thouh it may be sad to say, they mention nothing abut the flaws, such as crashes and incedint! Overall, IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT!!!"
2,Book on United Airlines,"When I ordered the book, I thought it would be a regular sized book, but instead was a slim and small pocketbook. Frankly, I did NOT like the book, especially because I already knew most of the info the author poorly wrote about. To tell the truth, I was very disappointed with the book contents and, if I knew beforehand what the book was like, I would definitely NOT have ordered it."
3,Know your product,My 2 year old daughter loves this product. Be aware that if you put the slides in facing the wrong way then you will lose sound!
3,So-so,"This is a great idea for an older child, but for one under 5 it has a very small attention grabber. The disks are hard to insert with tiny fingers and if they are not really careful, a disk can get ruined just putting it in and taking it out."
4,Can't Wait To Read First Hand,I purchased this book for a good friend of mine who had expressed interest in reading it. We both like reading books and articles on healthier living and weight loss. She has found a lot of helpful information in this book and I am hoping she is able to wean herself from it long enough for me to read it.
2,basic is the word,"these struts are your absolute basic strut. comes with no needed accessorys. the extras cost 35.00 x, so better off buying the fully assembled strut. as for the responsiveness, it's as bad as the old strut that came off of it. when unlocked, it just barely pushed the rod out. the old shock worked better."
4,Very Dissastisfied,When I received this purchase It was packaged as it should be and it was a new disk but it freezes alot and skips scenes due to it freezing so I was not very happy because of that.Barb
4,Heart warming,"A heart warming story about how a basically good boy perseveres despite his dysfunctional father and mother until he comes under the influence of a juvenile deliquent, then is redirected by his principal so that he is saved by the kindness of Mrs. Ritchie.Gena Rowlands as Mrs. Ritchie, Kevin Zegers as Charlie, Cameron Daddo as Charlie's mother, and Darcy Dunlop as Charlie's father give great performances. The two men who play Mrs. Ritchie's ""retarded"" sons are also amazing. James Caan gives a strong cameo. Justin Chatwin as the troublemaking juvenile delinquent is also very good.The story hinges on a lie that Charlie told as a child. While the father's problems might be explained by the lie, there must be much more than the lie to explain the mother's problems.The film shows the damage that can be done by damaged parents. It also highlights the importance of second chances and love."
4,Excellently Acted,"This is a surprisingly emotional and captivating flick. I found this movie to be somewhat cliche at times, but the fact is, I didn't really mind. The simple story and lovable characters drew me in and held me. Gena Rowlands in the title role was, as always, engaging and lovely to watch. The other actors did a fine job as well, but I was particularly intrigued by the rather convincing portrayal of Mrs. Ritchie's mentally challenged son by an unkown actor named Jeremy Raymond. This is a fine movie that can be enjoyed by all, I would strongly encourage everyone to check it out."
3,"good, but not great","focuses almost exclusively on V. rosenbergi studies and little else on other species of varanus. has some good general data on preferred temperature ranges, metabolic rates, and other data related to scientific studies of varanids but misses the mark that most people who purchase these books are herpetoculturists/hobbyists. They want to know data on all species related to diet, humidity, habitat, etc to create a functional environment for their kept species. for that, i give it 3 stars out of 5. it misses the mark for hobbyists."
4,I'll Take That As A Yes,"Ok so Phil is not the most talented vocalist in country music today, but he is one of the best songwriters around. The hits he's managed to put out there thru some of today's best performers (Jo Dee Messina, Tim Mcgraw, etc...) are enough to outnumber the ""hits"" contained in some of the so-called greatest hits out there in the market. Honestly, first time I heard of Vassar was when the hit ""Just Another Day In Paradise"" came out some few years ago back then, I did not realize he'd already made a name for himself as a writer. This album does contain HIS hits...hits he himself created and there's no disputing that. In all fairness, he sings all these songs best he can and does well in his efforts. So, did I enjoy the album? I'll Take That As A Yes!"
5,Absolutely Phantastic,"This album is awesome, it not only is a compilation of Phil's greatest hits on one cd, but it also gives you a recording of the songs that he wrote for other artisits with him singing which is very cool!"
5,Best of the Best,Phil Vassar has done it again! I have been waiting for this CD. I just love his view of the songs that he has written. Yes Tim Colin and JoDee has a twist on the song that they sing. But to hear the true form of how a song is supposed to have been from the original artist is just wonderful. Phil has poured his heart out in these songs. His newest songs are very heartfelt and mean so much not just for Phil but for so many others. Keep up the great work!You will not be disapppointed in this CD. What a wonderful job!
3,Phil Vassar Greatest Hits,I absolutely love this CD..this collection of music is the best of the best. It explains why I have loved so many other artist's songs - that's because Phil wrote them. It is great to hear how Phil sings them. He doesn't miss a beat. A MUST HAVE.
5,"Just can't get my ""Phil"" of his music!",This is one of the best greatest hits compilations of all time! Phil Vassar is the best singer/song writer/musician in the country music industry today. I listen to this CD in my car over and over again. I can't get enough!
5,"reallyfantastic, actually","I had heard a lot of these somgs performed before by different artists, and didnt realize that Phil Vassar wrote them. He sings these tunes great himself. I think that Phil is a fantastic song writer, his songs make sense and have a meaning and purpose. I have only listened to this cd of Phils but I am now a fan, as good of a performer as he is, he is an even better song writer. Great cd, for any Phil Vassar fan, or country fan in general I feel as if this is a must have."
5,I love this CD!,This is the first Phil Vassar CD that I have and I really like it. I always like his songs that are played on the radio. This is the perfect CD to have because it includes all of the popular songs.
2,Greatest Hits???,"Let's be honest here! If Phil Vassar (a collective WHO?) is that good he would have sold more albums. Overall he is a nice songwriter who is being pushed by the label in our faces. Ahhh....not that great! One good song on the cd ""Another Day in Paradise"". The rest are mediocre and in a year you will not be listening to this CD. It just doesn't last. A work of ART??? Must be a relative or ""Label-Hired"" review writer. Trust me Nashville does that too!"
5,Fly...,"The more I listen to this CD the more I like it. There are some great tunes on the CD. My particular favorite is Fly. The beat is great, the lyrics are fun and the harmony... Well, what is there to say about the harmony. It's classic EFO. The CD is definitely worth the money."
4,Another fine EFO,"Another great albumn from EFO-- it is a bit more country than some, butreally IMO with Lloyd Maines producing, a little bit more 'smoothed out pop.' I think the first couple songs are the weakest (though they're growing on me some); but overall still very clever, very fine singing byJulie Murphy-Wells (boy, is she ever underrated IMO!) and the guys. I think Robbie Schaefer's songs better here than some recent albums.I can't quite give it 5 stars-- wish they had 4.5 :). Fine effort though."
3,batteries for an old camera,The product does what it is supposed to - supply power to a Kodak camera. And my sister in law is happy.
5,A blessing to all!!,This was a great book!! Being a black woman - and the statistics indicate that Black Women are the largest growing risk group for HIV and AIDS because of the down low phenomenon. I am very happy that a PASTOR (my Pastor) has written a book to take a leading role in stopping this trend. Instead of driving people into the closet - he is letting them know that GOD can deliver them.Pastor - my God continue to bless you and your family!!
2,Essence of Church Lady,"I ordered this item hoping it would smell as nice as it looked. In my opinion, it starts out floral and ends with bad breath. For a free sample go to your nearest church, find the oldest lady wearing china-blue eye shadow and take a whiff. Fortunately I know plenty of takers for my gift-set."
3,Lost potential.,"Loosely based on the crimes of Richard Trenton Chase a.k.a. ""The Vampire of Sacramento"" RAMPAGE starts out with a bang but then just fizzles out into a sub-par courtroom drama complete with a ending so blah that I could barely remember it 30 minutes after the movie was over.I originally saw this movie as a teenager around 1992/93 and liked it quite a lot, so watching it again now was a big disappointment. Too much talking and not enough action. The main problem is the movie focuses too much on the District Attorney prosecuting the killer and not enough on the killer himself.Worth watching once.D: William Friedkin (BLUE CHIPS, JADE)Anthony Frasier - Michael Biehn (THE TERMINATOR, ALIENS)Charlie Reese - Alex McArthur (ROUTE 666, KISS THE GIRLS)Naomi Reece - Grace Zabriske (THE PRIVATE EYES, DRUGSTORE COWBOY)"
3,Not the most comfortable swim goggles,"Attractive goggles with clear vision for nearsighted people but they press on your eye sockets in such a way that they are uncomfortable. If you have them tight enough to be waterproof it only adds to the discomfort. Loosening them helps, but then water gets inside the lenses. Not as happy as I thought I would be the goggles."
3,"Good, but not fully satisfied","I wanted to review this product and give it a rating sooner, but got delayed. During the period, I used the goggles quite often and found a few drawbacks. I bought it with both -5.5 corrective lenses which are about okay with my eyes, although my left eye still feels a little blurred. Also it is comfortable to wear. However, there are the following issues. First, the seal by the soft silicon material wrapping around the slot of the hard frame is not tight enough to prevent leaking under water; Second, the anti-fog coating quickly disappear and the inside of the lenses gets foggy; Third, the nose bridge tends to slip wider and become loose.I bought another swim goggle by Speedo from local Sports Authority store which was all good but had no corrective lenses. Therefore, the corrective lenses this product offers is necessary for people who have higher degree of shortsightedness. I don't find other better alternatives."
2,nothing special,I should have just picked up a phone at a discount chain. The quality of this phone was not good.
4,pleasant surprise,"This book is not at all what I thought it would be. I bought it because it was a kindle daily deal, but it was such a pleasure to read. I couldn't put it down. It was intriguing, historically mostly accurate (the author mentions in the end that she researched books/diaries from back in that era) and it was just lovely."
4,At the Sign of the Sugared Plum,A harrowing tale of the dangers of everyday life during the plague. Straightforward and honest. The author did a fine job with this tale.
4,At the Sign of the Sugared Plum,"At the Sign of the Sugared Plum was a good read, however, I would have liked it to be just a little longer. Maybe just one more chapter to let the reader know how Hannah and her sister Sarah fared on their journey home, and if the baby Grace made it to her family safely. I realize this is a book written for young adults, but it was a good story relating the horrors of the plague in London."
4,Good read!,"An interesting read. The time of the plague around the world in 1665 was informative and the writing of friends and family made for an intimate knowledge of that time, and the struggles.The relationship between two sisters and their friends and hardships were heartwarming.I will look for more books by the same author."
4,"Wonderful Intro to a New ""Olde"" Time","A wonderful peek into the past. This book shows that ""merry olde England"" was not so merry after all, especially when The Black Death, bubonic plague, swept through London in 1665. Honest but not overpowering in its depiction of the tradgedy, with adventure and a little romance; honest too in its hints of the bawdiness of the times. A believable and likable heroine, a page-turning climax, a great read."
5,Fantastic story,"I first checked this out from the local library and loved it then--and wanted to own it. The author is marvelous in her level of historical research into the ""great plague,"" and deftly manages to write unflinchingly of the horrors of this frightening epoch in history while still weaving in sparkling threads of youthful exuberance and a tender love that emerges for the young heroine of the tale. I have also read the sequel, but this is the best of the series. Really sticks with you."
3,Good read for older kids who are interested in history,"I am far from a young teen girl, being an old grand dad. As a former history teaching however I found this an interesting read. I like the everyday-ness to the story as we learn about living life in a desperate time. I would recommend it to mature 8-13 year olds as it deals with death in a very blunt and unromantic manner."
1,My 12 year old hated it,"My daughter is an avid reader, but she absolutely hated this book. She struggled with the old terms spoken in the 1600""s and found it to be way too morbid. The visuals of dead bodies and the looming fears of the plague were too depressing. She has read historical fictions before and enjoyed them, but she claims that this was the worst book that she has read. I decided to write this review in case you see the great reviews here and are persuaded to have your child read it. If you have a sensitive child, be aware they may not enjoy this novel. Adults will enjoy this book more than most children."
4,A collection of treasures,"To read the short stories in Glenn Blake's Drowned Moon is to swim through a subterranean town like the one in his story ""Chocolate Bay,"" just below the surface of the narrative. These are compelling stories, haunted by the unconscious life of the characters. Blake makes the subtext of their lives palpable by seamlessly interweaving character and setting--swamps and bayous, houses with back porches, dogs in the yards. The exquisite light and color of this world is grounded by the down-to-earth people and their alligators, trucks, fishing, kids. One of the most accomplished stories is ""Hazard,"" about old rivalries between two brothers, with an ending all the more satisfying for taking the reader so completely by surprise. Some of these stories will break your heart, even as Blake's comic sensibility makes you laugh. This is a collection of treasures--literary and humane--not to be missed."
1,"It doesn't work as promised. Now have to return it. I turned it in every direction possible, and it still does not charge.",Product does not work as promised. Was instructed to turn the battery in the opposite direction and I did so. It still does not charge.
5,"good price, good fit",Product fit perfectly in my truck and was easy to install. Looks as good as if I had it professionally installed.
2,Top ring had a hole in it.,The top ring of this pool has a pinhole leak somewhere in it that I can't locate so I just leave it deflated and use the other two.
4,tall sides. good for price.,"We actually bought this pool to use as a ball pit. It is bigger than we thought it would be, so we didn't end up buying enough balls. After all was said and done we ended up buying 600 balls to fill it to a level that makes it a true ball pit. 300 balls about covered the bottom. I love the high sides, which definitely set this pool apart from the rest. I'm also interested to see how it will fair as an actual pool come summer.The first one we were sent had a hole in the yellow ring, but the replacement was fine. Each ring has to be blown up separately, which is good because then you'll be less likely to lose all the water over the sides if there was a hole and all of the rings were connected. The air filled edges are nice for when he gets in and out because he snakes over the side and rolls in and the edges are soft and give, so he can do it all by himself.So far we are pleased."
4,Child pool,Product arrived on schedule and was exactly as advertised. It was sturdy and safefor kids. Great to fill with colorful plastic balls or used a splash pool.
1,Would have been a great pool - if it didn't leak,"I was very excited to order this pool and thought my kid's would love it. It is indeed deep, like other reviewers have stated and seemed like it was going to be a lot of fun. Unfortunately for us, it started leaking from the second it was blown up. I patched the first leak (along the seam of the yellow ring) but by the end of the day there was a second leak as well. I'm sure it is a great pool if you happen to get one without any holes."
3,Swimming pool,It is a way cute swimming pool and my daughter loved it and had a great time swimming in it
4,Cool pool!,"I purchased this pool for my 2 girls, 2 and 12. It was large enough for my older daughter to and enjoy and small enough to be safe for our youngest. We had frequent neighborhood pool parties and had up to 5-6 kids in it at a time. (The little ones loved bouncing on the walls into the water!) The walls are high and well constructed, very heavy gauge plastic in the bottom. It lasted the whole summer with almost daily use. Since it is inflatalbe, I didn't expect it to go beyond one season...and it did get a slow leak in one of the rings. The best thing is that each ring inflates on it's own, so if there is a leak in one, the whole thing does not deflate. We have it stored for next summer and will see if we can find the leak...if now, will probably order the same one."
3,Hard to blow up,"It's a cute pool and nice size. However, there are no big valves to blow up with a portable inflator. Each ring has a small valve like what is on swim floats. Also, it doesn't seem sturdy, and the bottom is not padded. It does have a water hole in the bottom to help with draining."
4,great little pool for the price,"I bought this pool at the beginning of the summer and my grandkids loved it.....We made the mistake of deflating it and leaving it in the corner of the outside deck. When we opened it up 2 weeks later, mice had eaten through it to make a nest. So, even the mice love the pool. I did buy another one and intend to store it INSIDE. The price (both times) was reasonable."
1,faulty product,"My granddaughter was visiting so we ordered this pool. Took it out of the box, inflated and filled with water. Next morning it was empty. We found places where the seam was not sealed. We have patched and filled twice with NO success. Very disappointed little girl."
2,Buy something better,"Poor quality pool, the material is very thin. We bought this late in the season for our kids to play in, so all the other same sized pools were sold out. The worst part about this pool is the sides bulge out when filled with water. Spend the extra money and get something better."
4,Nice product,"This was nicely made, decent material and seems durable enough for young children. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a pool that size."
2,lasted a few days,This pool was used as a ball pit and two of the chambers dkept leaking. It lasted about a month before I just threw it out....
2,"Very thin, punctured easily","I was very happy with this pool until it punctured after one week. I had it outside on my patio. I do live in a place where there are thorns around, so this was a big test for the plastic. But the pool totally failed. I thought I was being smart b/c the pool had 3 different air compartments that are separate. So if one punctured, I could still use the pool b/c the other compartments would be fine. But within two weeks every air compartment was punctured. It is just very thin plastic. Beware!"
2,Just ok for the price. Didn't last the summer though.,I wasn't expecting high quality for the price I paid but I do wish it lasted at least a month. We had it in our backyard and no matter how flat we thought the ground was it still leaned something fierce to where it was almost unusable. Even on the patio! The only way we could get it to sort of be stable is to just fill it up with a tiny bit of water. I think next year we will just fork up the money and get something nicer.
1,Leak!,"What a dissapointment for my 2 year old; the pool had a leak in it. It began with a slow leak in the top ring (which appeared immediately after blowing it up for the first time!), then the whole thing began to melt -- all within the first couple of days. Why again is the US outsourcing to Chinese companies when all they produce is garbage???"
1,Came with a leak,The pool was big and would have been great except it came with a leak which was very disappointing.Will try a different style.
4,"Good read, but disappointing after Julian's House","I was really looking forward to reading this book; Hawkes' other novel, Julian's House, capivated me. Unfortunatley, I feel this book doesn't quite reach the same level as Julian's House. My Soul to Keep isn't as creepy, the characters aren't as developed, the plot isn't as convincing. That being said, however, this novel is still a good read. The last half of it is much better than the first, and there are more than a few glimpes of the style that made Julian's House such an utterly believable,atmospheric story. I will still be on the lookout for a third Hawkes' novel, and I hope it will be closer in spirit to Julian's House than to My Soul to Keep"
4,Good little gadget,"Overall this product works very well. I only gave it 4 stars as some times the paper roll jams and you have to open it and pull out the chewed bit but this has always happened when I've used the scissor cut button and then not advanced the roll a little before typing the next text. Aside from this quirk, it works very well. The lettering is clear and easy to read. I have used the Dymo iron on label roll and it works well too, I used this on my son's socks (on the sole) and a year on and many washes, the labels are still stuck onto the fabric - the writing is getting a little worn, but considering the the location and the amount of dirt that gets on them, I'm impressed."
3,ken,"IT works like a charm, this particular model is one of the easiest to understand and use.The print has three different fonts and easy to replace the tape."
4,my opinion,this book is a great book wich if you know how to play an instrament you will inspired to continue and do your best
1,Not for me,I tried this in my Kodak CD33 and first it was kind of hardish to get in but did fit snug and it didn't seem to hold a charge that long at all. And the last thing is now the bottom of my camera is cracked due to trying to get the battery in and closed. That's just my experience though. It may be different for you and you might like it but it's not for me.
4,Transforming,"A very transforming book. I thoroughly enjoyed the precise, practical approach by the author, in conveying the essentials for transforming your mind to the Mind of Christ."
5,In my Top Ten most life changing books....,"This is a life-changing book. I read it in 2009 and was eye-opening. buy it. Read it every year. I put it in the same category as ""Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire"" (Cymbala), Mere Christianity (CS Lewis) and ""Wild at Heart"". Great book."
5,This is such an awesome book.,This book completely transformed the way I see the world - it is an amazing testimony to what life can look like when you REALLY have the mind of Christ. I recommend it highly for everyone.
5,Buy This Book!,"Bill Johnsons follow up book to ""When Heaven Invades Earth"" is one of the best books I have ever read. The insights into Scripture and into my own heart stopped me dead in my tracks. I would re-read every chapter when I hit the last page, just to get more, to wring every bit out of it. If you want more of HIM, this book will make your heart sing for joy!"
5,Worthwhile read,Excellent book. I'v aleady loaned my copy to a missionary friend. Can't wait to discuss!
4,"This book was ok, but nothing extrordinary",This book did not excite me. I am not saying it is bad because I know many people really like it. But for some reason it just did not catch my attention. It is a great book for understanding healing
5,I am changed because I read this book.,You need to read it for yourself to believe you can change the way you think permanently.
5,Excellent product & price,"Prompt shipping, new books in perfect condition for used book price. Excellent seller."
4,My new fav artis,"This is a review from a JUGGALO. The only reason I bought this album, is the fact that TWIZTID did the bonus track with them. I will be honest. POTLUCK is my new fav rap group. The only con is.....they rap ALOT about weed...alright we get it,....everyone likes and smokes weed. But that aside, they are a good pairing. You have GOT to check out :what we are: feat tech9ne. Some of the fastest legit rapping I have ever heard. Kudos. I really do like this album."
5,Guitar Mastery Captured on disc,"The recording of Tony Rice and John Carlini is excellent in many ways. It was recorded using a single stereo microphone, which make it sound like you're sitting in a room with Tony and John playing for you. Their talent is unsurpassed on guitar, making anyone who's ever played the guitar envious. If you're looking for a comforting, easy to listen to, collection of pure accoustic guitar. This CD should be first on your list. I've found that I can use it as background music for a small gathering, romantic background music, or I can sit and listen intently to the intricacies of each selection and constantly find something new to be impressed with on this CD."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you are a novice and know little about the darkside of computers, this book might help you. On the other hand, if you look up hacking on the web, you will gain as much or probably more information than this book will give you. I didn't get anything out of this book that I've already knew. All that Robert Merkle does in the book was make fun of those who knew nothing on the subject, making fun of ignorance. He just brags on how smart he was. However, if he was truly smart, he would cut out the garbage and give the reader more information. Most of the information given in the book is based on common sense and very very beginning hacker information. Don't waste your time. I think I'm going to return this book. Don't waste your money people."
1,Don't bother.,"This book is not worth your money. Granted there is some information for the beginner, but everything else is the author showing off how smart he is."
2,Full of scare tactics and misinformation,"I had the misfortune of buying and reading this book for a course on Computer Security. If you're looking for the glance into the mind of a typical ""3l33t h@x0r"" you might find this interesting. If you're already familiar with the information security field you'll recognize that most of this book is at best very out of date, and at worst completely untrue. If you're not familiar with computers and the internet, please take this book with a HUGE grain of salt. It's meant to scare you, and if you let it, it will.For $4 in the fiction section this might be a quick, fun read. For more than $10 it's really not worth it."
3,Interesting but not epic./,"I found the book interesting especially the naval war segment with the Tripolians. However, when the writer described the Mexican Was and how the deserters were lured away by the young Mexcian girls bathing in the river, he repeated that same description several time.Overall i enjoyed it and learned much about the acquisition of Texas."
2,Too small!,"I usually wear an 8 1/2, but based on other reviews I ordered a 9! The 9 was SO tight on my toes. I had to return them. The bow tie also looked funny! It didn't lay right across my foot."
1,My Stupid Mistake,"Without thinking twice I ordered this thinking it was Morton Subotnick, it turned out to be some run-of-the-mill pop music, embarassingly enough I made this mistake twice with this artist, seeing as it was my own fault I don't think I'm eligible for a return, not to mention I've been having a hard time with Amazon returns lately."
2,big and cheap,"This was made with the lowest cost materials making it barely able to hold tools, luckily I'm using it for our First aid kit and gauze is not heavy. Also the latches are not easy to undo and I'm no lady. The last time I tried to open it, the latch cut my finger so now I don't even use them and pick it up from the sides."
3,Good Double Concerto but.......,"If you are looking for an inexpensive version of the Bach Double Concerto, this version will certainly fit the bill. While the playing is not the most virtuosic you will ever hear, the performance has an enormous amount of feeling and passion plus really good sonics. The two concerti for single violin are not competitive. The violin sound is really raw and the playing seems insecure. If you have no interest in the single concerti, go ahead and buy it. But if you want good performances of all three, look elsewhere."
4,"Shop Fox 14"" band saw","I purchased this saw about 9 months ago. Upon arrival I found the saw to be well packaged and in good condition. An inspection verified that all parts were present and accounted for with no damage. Following the instructions in Shop Fox's manual I setup the saw. Note I also purchased the riser block and a Timber Wolf 3/4"" resaw blade for this saw. Please note that the blade that comes with the saw is of only fair quality. Since owning the saw I have resawn several pieces of quarter sawn white oak, even up to 8-1/2"" wide with very little drop in saw speed. Now I will admit that setup and a great saw blade go a long way to help this situation, but I have to say that so far I really like this saw."
5,Well Pleased!,"It took around 30 minutes to assemble. Somewhat longer to get the blade to track correctly.Started it up and it sounded loud, after investigating it I found the wheel rubbing the shroud. Fixed this by shimming the latch out by 1/8"". I was and am still amazed at how quite the unit runs. No vibration whatsoever! Cuts good with the blade that was supplied with the unit.Am well pleased and will purchase other Shop Fox equipment for the Cabinet shop in the future!"
4,This is a good second or third book on generalized functions,"This is a good second or third book on generalized functions which are otherwise known as ""distributions"". A good first book is ""Fourier Analysis and Generalised Functions"" by Lighthill. This book is based on a graduate course and provides a good introduction to distribution theory and generalized Fourier analysis. You need to have a good background in advanced calculus and be comfortable with Lebesgue theorems concerning interchangeable limit processes. The examples are quite good, but the notation is intense and the way that it is packed in small font onto a page doesn't help. The writing is compact and thorough.I recommend this book to anyone who has had the standard digital signal processing course where the Delta function (distribution) is used freely and who has wondered what it really means."
4,Note on Delta function,"Just a note for readers of these reviews: there are two delta functions used in signal processing. In digital signal processing the Kronecker delta is used, which is simple. In continuous-time signal processing the Dirac delta is used, which is a generalized function and causes sophomores no end of headaches. Zemanian's book will be helpful for those wishing to know more about generalized functions such as the Dirac delta. Those just wishing to know a little more might find the articles on Wikipedia about Dirac delta more helpful."
1,Unorganized,"For a reference book, it does a terrible job providing a quick reference for the syntax. The book is very unorganized, and the diagrams are terrible. I don't suggest you buy this book."
2,Difficult to understand,"I purchased this book because it had a CD-Rom;however, the passwords and user names are not given to use to access the databases and the book does not give you the information. If you are looking for a book that offers SQL for Oracle. Oracle8i The Complete Reference is what I would recommend. The examples this book gives are not clearly defined. I had a difficult time understanding this book."
5,great recipes with southwest flavor,"Some of the entries in this cookbook seem a little odd (dishes from other countries, etc), but overall the recipes in this book are exciting and flavorful. Since these recipes aren't necessarily ""local"" food, some of them will be new even to Arizonans (of which I am one)."
4,"Work's great, very happy with this cover.","My star rating may be low, because some of the questions weren't relevant (this is not a fun or educational toy)! That said, this work's great on my 120"" inflatable rectangular pool, the fit is perfect. I'm very happy with how far down the side flaps go down, I've never had wind get under the cover and certainly it has kept out all debris. Even though there has been some dicoloration due to the sun, it hasn't affected the durability of the plastic. The only area that is showing some wear is the ""grommet"" areas that the cord goes through. Mine hasn't worn through yet, but probably will next year, I think I will reinforce the area with some duct tape."
4,Pool Cover,The pool cover is a good value - It works well keeping the pool clean of bugs and tree droppings. Very easy for one person to remove. I would recommend purchasing this cover when buying the pool.
3,ok,wasnt very easy to use didnt stay on great some frogs still got in and laid eggs. wasnt easy for my kids to use so they mostly didnt try
1,Not what I hoped for,"Not that great for a inflatable pool. Loved the idea, although, it isn't working for us. It keeps the leaves out... Not the bugs. It heats up the pool water too much so when you go use the pool you have to put more water in it anyway."
4,Not great but worth it,My pool cover didn't come with any instructions but I am guessing it was supposed to. It came with the large plastic cover and one really long piece of string that is used to tie it down. I don't know if I cut the string the way it was meant to go but it works fine. The pool cover stays in place well considering it is really windy where I live. It doesnt keep everything out but probably 95% so it is still worth it. I didn't have the problem with bugs that others mentioned but I live in a dry climate so that might help. I was just glad that there is something to cover this size pool (the cover size is perfect for the size listed in the description) because it takes forever to fill. It is nice to not have to refill it all the time and is worth the price.
3,Pool cover,"As said in a lot of other reviews, the cover is too big.. much bigger than shown in the picture. So, it doesn't fit snugly as it should but I was just looking for something to keep the pool cleaner so I didn't have to change the water quite so often, esp in a pool that hold 132 gallons. So, I am happy with it. It is a lot thinner than I expected too and a light clear-blue so it lets a lot of sunlight in and makes the pool even hotter.. also not a great thing. But like I said, just looking for something to keep the water cleaner and it does a good enough job for me."
3,It is what it is,"Well it fits just fine if you get this pool:[...]which I believe is the pool it was designed for. I just put it on tonight and it covers just like the photo, it is not dark solid blue though, it is see through blue so I wonder if that will affect the algea or warmth of the water or anything. I don't know how good it is to keep bugs out just yet because today is the first day of using it. I have a skimmer though so I can skim those out, I mainly bought the cover to keep out leaves and bird droppings which I am hoping it does. The material is thin but it's $9 so not like I had high expectations, the kiddie pool cost me less than $30 so didn't want to spend more than $10 on a cover for it. So far for the price I am happy with it. I will update the review to let you know if it keeps stuff out of the pool."
2,Far too big,"This cover is far too big for the smaller model of pool for which it claims to fit. Also, the system by which it is secured to the pool is nearly pointless. It amounts to nothing more than cutting your own lengths of the provided rope and trying to slide it under the pool, which is virtually impossible when it's full of water. I'm not very happy with it, but I guess one can't ask too much from a $20 pool with $15 cover."
4,It worked for us,"Despite the reviews above, I thought this pool cover worked really well for the pool it is designed to cover. I had no problem keeping bugs and rainwater out of our pool and it provided great solar heat, warming the pool to wonderfully warm temps! I have had this pool cover for 2 summers and it is holding up wonderfully. Our biggest problem is keeping our pool from deflating. We have gone through 4 pools in 2 summers. This years pool just deflated once again."
2,Not very secure!,"This item did not stay on the pool. If the wind blew, it flew off. We ended up having to buy a different one. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Fits great on my blowup pool,"I bought this to fit over my backyard blow up pool that is approximately 118"" x 70"".Intex Swim Center Family Pool (Colors and Styles May Vary)It stays securely on unless we have a lot of wind. I have not added the ropes since I have not needed them yet. If it's calling for a big storm I do one of 2 things. 1--Get the cover wet and it sticks great to the pool. 2--I just take it off until the storm has passed. If the pool isn't near any trees, then shouldn't be too much debri that gets it in. Nothing a little strainer can't get out. Love having this cover. It helps to warm the water in the pool as well as keeps it clean. Before it would only be a day or 2 and it was starting to get gross. Now, we can go all week with crystal clear water. Best part is no bugs, leaves, grass, etc get in. I had no idea how often the birds were pooping in the pool until we got the cover and daily there is bird poop on it. Yuck! So happy with my cover."
3,It's OK,"This cover does what it says, but I was a bit dissapointed. I was hoping it was going to fit a bit snugger around the pool. I really just sits on top with a tie around it that you have to make super tight for the wind to not blow it off."
2,"Pool cover, or not?",I was hopeful about this item. We had a pool cover before but it did not stay in place so the fact that this had draw string really seemed perfect. Well we have only had it for a couple of weeks and it is already ripping all over. It is really cheap and is a waste of money because it's not going to last through the summer. I love the draw string idea. If it was only thicker and made out of a better material it would be great. But it's not and I would not buy again.
3,Mission Accomplished,"We were looking for a cover for our inflatable pool in an attempt to use the same water for more than one day. Although our pool is not the same brand as the cover, the cover has done exactly what we hoped it would do."
2,For Shrunken heads!,I gave it a two because it did not state the size. I do not have a big head by any means. If anything I have a smaller than average head size. This thing is for head sizes ages 9-12. Know what you are buying.
5,Keep your cool,"As a guy that shaves my head; this head wrap keeps my head dry and safe from the hot sun rays while being out on a hot day, I am looking into buying a few more in different colors."
5,Must have for video editing enthusiast,"This DVD immediately helped me gain confidence in using features I hadn't yet tried. Since so many people need to learn by seeing/doing, this DVD has allowed me to improve my final edited product. I haven't even watched the whole thing---but will as I tackle more sophisticated features!"
4,Looks great,"I purchased this bracelet because I was having arthritis problems. I really don't notice any difference after wearing it, but the bracelet is very attractive"
3,mixed results,The Sabona bracelet is very pretty. I feel the clasp could be designed a little differently. It's very secure but difficult to clasp in place. I haven't found the magnet to be very effective in helping my arthritic pain but perhaps some people do get relief. I wear it because it does look nice.
2,Poor gold plating,I loved this bracelet until just after the warranty ran out. At that time the gold plating began wearing off and when I emailed them they did not respond. The bracelet is losing its luster and turning silver. Too bad because it was very pretty for about 7 months. I don't recommend it unless you buy a silver one.
4,"Nice bracelet, pretty powerful","The Sabona Lady Executive, hate the name, love the bracelet. It's 1300 gauss magnets and stylish design are a winning combination. Wearing magnets helps with my tendonitis & carpal tunnel pain. This bracelet's so light, I forget it's on my wrist. It also doesn't pick up pins and paperclips like my hematite magnetics do. Only wish the magnets were a bit higher gauss."
4,Stands up through daily wear,"This is always a great product and this is not an exception. The bright shiny finish stands up through daily wear and bathing. Just a soft cloth wipe and back again to a like new finish. Oh, did I say the magnetic properties of this product do work for my 76 year old mother who loves the style and function."
5,Nice,Bought this for my mother in law for christmas! Product arrived on time. Looks expensive for the price. Hope it helps with the pain in her hands.
3,"Not great, but not bad","I got ahold of a copy through a friend at a local alternative weekly. I collect collections; haven't read ""After Hours"" but have seen reviews and I know Robert Fleming puts out a great product. However, aside from the creative/departure from the norm stories by S. Barnes, Ross, C. Chambers and maybe three or four others, and the humorous strands by another group, I really don't see why this collection collects the raves it has so far. The line between erotic literature and pulp fiction can be a thin line. Luckily, ""Intimacy"" stays over that line into erotic lit., but not by much."
2,Jesnluck,"This book was not all I thought it would be....I got lost in some of the stories and found myself putting the book down.....Iread all the time, but this book did not get my attention and make me want to continue reading it. Some of the storie were ok, but I am not sure that the title goes with the book...I feel like it was a waste of time to order."
4,Lessons for all ages...,"Horton Hears a Who is filled with messages for people of all ages. Horton is so sweet, trustworthy, kind, loyal. Then there are those busybody Wickersham Brothers and the kangaroo who refuse to listen to what Horton has to say. But they don't just ignore him, they treat him terribly. The one page in the book where Horton is roped, mauled and caged was very disturbing to me. My grandchildren are very young and I chose to reword this page a little. But we had seen the new Horton movie just recently and they knew how aweful Horton's fellow jungle dwellers were. The dark color of some pages made reading it in low light nearly impossible for older eyes. But the grandchildren love Horton and the wonderful Dr. Seuss rhymes. I still recommend it and will read it over and over. Love the message, ""a person is a person, no matter how small."""
5,"Great, engaging","This is a delightful and engaging story for reading to children. Everything I expected for a Seuss book. Nice size, hard cover... Will be treasured."
5,Dr. Seuss-wonderful!,Dr. Seuss books are all wonderful books! I love this one since it has more of a touching story line.
5,it's Dr Seuss,It's Horton Hears a who!! Every Dr. Seuss book is worth buying. My kids loved reading and being read to with these books.
5,Dr. Seuss,Need I say anything? It is Dr. Seuss....love it...love it! We saw the movie and my son loves to have me read to him.....he always compares between the book and the movie and points out similarities and differences! You cannot go wrong with Dr. Seuss!!!
2,Violent -- age range?,"What age range is the book appropriate for?Poor Horton -- They beat him. They maul him. And try to cage him. And threaten to boil the dust speck in Beezle-Nut juice just to teach him a lesson.My poor 5 year old looked at me with sad eyes, and asked, ""why?""Not the best bed-time story."
3,Bad news,"Not one of Dr. seuss' best I`m afraid, i guess there's nothing better than Green Eggs and Ham."
2,disappointed,I ordered a new copy of this book. It was sent to me with a dirty film on the cover. This is supposed to be an xmas gift..... :(
3,An interesting reading!,"It is very important to understand societal symbols and superstitions, because symbols and emblems are often a reflection of the values in societies as well as a mirror of the inner views and secrets of its people.Mr. Goodman's book about symbols and magic is interesting and illuminating."
1,How could anyone screw this up so bad!,"I'm speaking about the unabridged audio. First of all the packaging was abominable. DO NOT drive and try to figure out this jumbled mess of cassettes. The packaging will cause you to have an accident and wish you would have never spent this kind of money on something so un-user-friendly. Second, Lee Horsley. Although technically good, he was the only voice. After a while I would have paid double for some dramatization and sound effects. As an addicted audiobook consumer my final advice is to read this great American Classic. Get a leatherbound edition because you will want to re-read it for the rest of your life."
5,Beautiful mushrooms,These are really great quality. Perfect for my Ginger Hot and Sour soup. I got 8 oz which will be enough for about 8 batches of soup this season. The strips are nice and long and stayed that way during shipping...VERY FAST service...ordered one day and these were here two days later! Very Happy and will order again.
3,does not replace the original adapter cable,I am a little disappointed that this cable did not do what I had purchased it for. My original cable broke...making the MSN not operable. It works soley as a charger - it does not reconnect the MSN link. I am bummed.
2,Not Applicable,"this item was returned for credit, however it has not been credited to my Bill Me Later Account."
1,Wrong item sent...but satisfied with outcome,I had to open the package to see the connector which was NOT what I ordered. I contacted the vendor who said because I opened the package I couldn't return it. I replied that they had my money and I had a connector I couldn't use. They reconsidered; I returned item and got refund. Shouldn't have to go through this if item isn't the correct product.
1,Garmin,Received product but it was not the product advertised. Wrong adapter for my Garmin. Had to return product and request refund. First time I have ever had a problem with Amazon. Maybe you should stick to selling books.
5,Garmin 12-volt adapter cable,"Product was EXACTLY what I wanted, the price was quite fair and I received it in a timely manner. i"
5,worked well,very well made the one that came with the garmin was crap! That is why I bought this one still going strong no problems
5,Now that you asked,"Product was just what I was anticipating it to be. Good quality, brand name. Not a cheap imitation.Ordering was easy and delivery was prompt. However, now that you asked, the shipping and handling fees were considerable more than expected."
1,Don't waste your money,"Adapter worked well for one month. Stopped working without any visible defect. Don't waste your money. Now, I am shopping for another one."
2,Be careful. This is a fraudulent listing.,"This is not a Garmin product. This is not ""by Garmin"". This is not a Garmin brand product. This is not Garmin model 010-10747-03. If you are looking for a genuine Garmin product, you will not get one if you buy the product in this listing. You may or may not get a product that functions properly but it will not be a Garmin product."
2,It broke after 2 months of use....,"I love my Garmin, but like a previous review mentioned that it ""fits snuggly into the outlet"". You should be extremely careful when removing the power cord head from your car's outlet. The tip of mine broke and i've had to replace it."
5,Its great,"This thing is better than the one that came with the GPS. Sturdier, better craftsmanship, I knew as soon as i took it out of the package that it was going to work great and I was right."
1,Adapter broke with normal usage,"I would have put this review on the GARMIN 770, but it is no longer available.The charger is very poorly made. My Nuvi 700 series gps was very expensive and should have had a good quality adapter. It did not. After several uses, the garmin stopped taking a charge. I found that if I wiggled the connector, the charge would begin. So, something in the connector part of the charger is crap and of course, the GPS is now useless because the battery is dead."
4,hard to find Garmin charger,works perfectly. According to West Marine product was no longer available from Garmin.
1,Din't Work,"I bought this 12 volt adaptor since my original got lost. My GPS used to keep power while plugged in to the original but this replacement one would not. So I changed the battery in the unit and tried the cable again.I kept getting an ""external power lost"" message in two different vehicles. I checked the adaptor fuse. It was fine. The GPS charges fine thru my computer USB connection.So I conclued that the 12 volt cable is faulty. I don't recommed it."
2,Looks good,I received the Garmin 12 V adapter for my 720 in the alloted time. Went on a road trip in my Mini and on my return the battery ran low. Have not determined the problem; perhaps a defective fuse.
1,Only lasted 4 months,I was excited to receive this replacement part for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. Little did I know it would stop working in only 4 months. Try another manufacturer for this part.
1,Utter Disappointment,"The cord randomly stops working while plugged in and rarely charged my Garmin. After a few days, it just died. Absolute waste of time and money"
3,Be sure to order the cradle too!,"The product is fine, but the cradle is the broken piece I needed. I did not realize it until after. Be sure to check all the parts to be certain you are getting the ones you need."
5,It works good,My Garmin c580 charger was broken because friend of mine lost fuse and tip. I used this charger's tip and fuse. Screw thing slightly different as other reviewer says but it works.This way I saved my MSN receiver. I have been using for just 2 days now.
3,replacement Nuvi 660 car charger,"works just fine as a charger. However, the original had the traffic information antenna and I do not believe this item does that."
4,Works on c550,"This charger works good; it fits snug though so make sure you pull it out gently, that's how I broke the first one"
4,Garmin Adapter Cable response to request,wow... I was surprised and the low cost for a GARMIN adapter cable. Even more surprising was the fast turn around in receiving the cable.EXCELLENT Customer Service. I received the replacement cable within 2 days!
1,Not as advertised,"I bought this cable because my Garmin 800 series cradle was broken, and product description said I could connect this cable to my GPS directly. Cable is not compatible with the GPS, even though it says on the packaging that it is. It does look like it should connect to the cradle, but I don't have one. I will have to spend more money to buy either a different cable or a cradle in order to be able to charge my GPS in the car. Right now I have no use for this product."
5,"Yup, it's a power cord...","Not quite sure what to write for a review. It's a power cord, and it powers my Garmin Zumo 550 perfectly."
1,Same faulty part as OEM!,"Ordered this Garmin charger based on great reviews as a replacement for the poorly designed Garmin charger that broke after 9 months of light use. The tip on the original charger is plastic and easily breaks after several months of use. I researched chargers and found the one pictured here as a more durable alternative. Unfortunately, Electronic Expo shipped the same part that came with my unit, not the one I ordered. Will not order from Electronic Expo again."
1,mis directed advertisement,"I bought the product for use with my GARMIN NUVI 660 and it was supposed to be universal. It was not and i had to send it back. That is too bad, too, because all of my dealings with AMAZON previous to that glitch were terrific and i still would recommend AMAZON to any of my friends."
1,Power cable 010-10747-03 DOES NOT FIT NUVI 650,"Because we had a generic vehicle power cable that fit the Nuvi 650 we used it but only to realize that we could not use the Garmin when it was being charged in the car. After reading several chats about this, we looked for the original cable that we received with the unit. We could not find it. We ordered from Amazon the Garmin 010-10747-03 even the package says that it is suitable for NUVI 650, well IT DOES NOT FIT INTO IT. When I saw that I went back to our stack of cables and found the original cable that was sent with the unit, well it is also the wrong cable. How does one get the correct 12 volts cable?"
5,Good Value,This product is as described on Amazon. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good value proposition.
1,Power cable charger breaks,"Like everyone else in these reviews, my power cable charger broke within less than a year."
1,Poor Construction,It fits too tightly in the cigarette adapter and mine broke after several months. I now have to order another one. The gps is fine tho.
3,I bought it to fix my traffic receiver.,"My Garmin Nuvi 785T came with a traffic receiver (GTM 20) that somehow came apart and the parts were lost (?grandson?). It wouldn't charge the Nuvi, but the traffic receiver worked. I ordered this item from Amazon, hoping to disassemble it and use parts (because the replacement GTM 20 was $88 to $120). When it arrived I unscrewed the top, removed the ""spacer ring"" and the fuse, then put them into the GTM 20. I then screwed the top from the ordered item into the GTM 20. The fit was very tight and threads perhaps slightly different...but IT WORKS.Prior to taking it apart, I had tested it for charging the Garmin and it worked fine for that as well. Very pleased with the money saved and the results."
1,disappointed,"Opened package, tried the charger, didn't work. Returning requires unopened package, my understanding. Charger just sitting here, out the money."
1,It dose not fit nüvi 750,"On the box it says that it fits the nüvi 750, but it does not. For all those who wonder if it is ""truly Garmin"", mine came in a genuine Garmin box."
3,Broken after less than 2 years with my Nuvi 780,"I bought this Garmin adapter cable in Oct 2010. Worked for about 2 years as advertised with my Garmin Nuvi 780 GPS. The thing worked for about 2 years and then just died about 10 days ago without warning. I have been very careful with it, since my original one was also broken without warning. One thing i hate about it from the beginning is that it does NOT have a LED indicator!!!!! Very annoying, since there is no way to tell if it's charging or not unless you look at the GPS battery level. Luckily, it's broken during a short trip, not a long trip. Considering that it worked for me for 2 years, i give it a 3 star."
4,"so far so good, but must handle with care","The quality on the adapter is weak, and therefore must be handled with care, otherwise it has worked well. I dont know why Gramin makes such cheap adapters (I guess to make $). The plastic is easy to beak when removing it from the plug."
5,Great for the Garmin Nuvi 660,I bought this replacement car charger for my Garmin Nuvi 660 after my other one broke. This is a great replacement and works great.
4,"So far, a fine replacement for my original Nuvi 760 cable","The original equipment cable that came with my Nuvi 760 was surprisingly flimsey and broke after two years of pretty light use. So far, this one is a perfectly adequate replacement, but it will be a while before I know if it's better (or worse) than the original."
5,Emmy Lovret on a garmin power cable,"The original cable broke after a couple of years of use, replaced it with this cable and has been working great. simple cable, works fine.[...].[...].[...]."
2,Partially broke a week into having it,"although my adapter still works, it broke a week into having it-the little knob at the end is stuck inside and I can hear rattling when it moves. I have to be careful when using it or else it stops working."
1,Non Working Junk,"I was excited to get a replacement cord at a reasonable price, THIS IS NOT A GARMIN PRODUCT. IT'S A TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK, POORLY MADE DOESN'T FIT INTO THE CAR POWER OUTLET VERY WELL.Dont waste your time, spend a little more and buy from the OEM from the manufacturer.You know the old saying "" I can get you oats at a cheep price... BUT if you want oats that haven't been through the horse, those come at a different price."
2,Garmin 12 volt adapter cable,"Today, the 22nd of November is the first chance I have had to use this adapter cable and the suction cup mount. I does not work! It is like there is a short somewhere and I don't know if it is in the adapter cable or in the mount. At any rate, I can't use my Garmin!"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"If there was a zero star rating, I would select it, the minimum of one star is too high a score. This cable's description is supposed to work for my Garmin model. It DOES NOT WORK!"
1,Doesn't work with 855,I'm not sure if the 855 has different power requirements (it uses that additional steering wheel mounted button for speech recognition) -- but this charger does NOT work with the 855 cradle.
5,Perfect Replacement,"Our Garmin stopped working, and once we determined that it was the power adapter, we went on line to Amazon to get a replacement. They had exactly the right model and they were able to expedite the delivery so we could take advantage of the nav. system on our trip. Amazon is always our first choice when we need an electronics item."
2,Flimsy - Lasted 4 months,"I bought this as a replacement to my original Garmin cable that came with the GPS when I purchased it. Unfortunately this one is of very poor quality. I received it in early November and just 4 months later, it has stopped working. I have to constantly re-adjust the cord to try and hold the connection to the power and it keeps turning off while I'm driving."
4,"Just as described, Great!",The Garmin GPS was as descried. It got here quickly and in perfect shape. Happy with dealing.
3,Garmin Streetpilot power cable,"The cable is much higher quality than some found elsewhere, but it's still a little short for my purposes."
3,Does not work for Zumo unless...,"If you're buying a Zumo and noticed that Amazon lists this as a ""frequently purchased together"" item for it, beware: You must also buy the automotive suction cup mount that they also list. This power cable does not fit directly into the Zumo. They don't tell you that part.They will charge you for return shipping since you will be returning it ""for reasons which were not the result of our error"". :-("
3,WARNING: Re: Nuvi 660 Traffic Alert,"This adapter does work for the Garmin nuvi 660.However, If You Subscribed to the Traffic Alert, this adapter WILL NOT PICK UP the traffic alerts nor will you even get an icon on your nuvi. There is another fuse in the original adapter that came with your Garmin nuvi that supports the ""traffic alert"". If your nuvi is still under warranty, Garmin will send you out a repair kit that includes another tip at no charge. They can at their discretion void your warranty if you use another adapter that did not come with your original unit.Please call 1-800-800-1020 (central time) 8am-7pm technical support. When the ""automated person"" comes on quickly press 2; then press 1 and you will be placed on hold for the next technician."
1,Breaks,"Stopped working after some time. The connection b/n one of the wires and the plug, where a small board connects the wires to the pins, broke. Soldered, worked a bit, now it is broken again. Tried to fix a second time only to fry the fuse. Not happy with how long it lasted."
1,Faulty Device,"I had a similar problem to the other reviewers. I plugged the charger in the very first time and it didn't work. The LED indicator light did not even illuminate. I know that the port on the vehicle works fine as I use it for other chargers all the time.I took this charger apart and noticed that the fuse was blown. I bought a replacement fuse that matched the specs on the one that came with it (and also what the people at Radio Shack said are needed for car chargers). I plugged it in again only to be disappointed once more. I opened it up, and the fuse was blown again.Something is clearly wrong with the electrical layout of this device."
4,Good Replacement,This is a replacement for my Garmin Nuvi 680. I losted my vehicle DC power adapter with MSN direct receiver. I don't want to spend more money therefore I ordered this one. Even though it's didn't have MSN direct but it does the job to power my 680.
5,"Clear FM Transmission, cheaper than mini USB chargers, As good or better than original","I bought this product after breaking my original Adaptor for the Garmin 885T. I first purchased an expensive replacement from Radio Shack: USB charger only, no FM transmission. I then checked Amazon and found this adaptor. What isn't mentioned is this also allows for FM transmission of your Garmin's Audio output--as does the original. The transmission is clearer than the original.If you've broken your original cable, this replacement cable is a great buy--especially for older Garmins!"
2,Didn't last...,Power cord failed after less than a year. Have to purchase a fourth cord for my 3 year old garmin now
5,Adapter Works Well !,"I ordered this adapter when my other one stopped working. It is working wonderfully, and I am very happy with it."
5,Exactly what I wanted/needed. I'm back into finding my way around!,Item came on time - was exactly what I wanted - price was right! Vendor performed well. I am happy!
4,it does what's it is suppost to...need i say more.,works just as it should... it would be great if auto manufacturers would place a 12v socket on the dashboard so there's isn't this long wire hanging around.
4,Another good deal.,"The product works as represented, including the voice commands. With discount pricing, it's a great value."
4,Replacement adapter,I wanted a new adapter because my old one was coming apart. This one I found online here and it was priced right. I ordered it and it came quickly in less than a week's time.
2,Get a back-up,"I had to buy a second one of these in under 45 days. I couldn't fully test the broken one right away since my wife had the Garmin with her while working out of town. I ordered another and had it shipped to her. I thought it was just a bad fuse. When she returned with it, I bought new fuses and checked cord when. Nothing. The Garmin would not power up or charge. The connections looked fine, metal tabs didn't look damaged. I tried all the fuses in the 4 pack...nothing. It's an inexpensive replacement for a hard to find cable but plan on buying two."
3,Car Charger - Non-USB,Works fine as a cheap solution if you don't have a traffic alert subscription. Take note that it is not a usb cable but uses the cigarette lighter.
1,Dead right out of the box,"Claims to be OEM Garmin but I doubt that. Made in China. Bought this cable based on price and OEM claim, plugged it in, and nothing works. Tried a different socket, still dead. Wiggled the cable, still dead."
1,Does not work in my van - not original Garmin product!!!,"I bought this cable to replace the original garmin cable (for garmin nuvi 760) that is going bad (it switches on and off). This cable does not work although it fits to the base of the gps. I do not know whether it does not connect to the base correctly or has trouble drawing electricity from the outlet (I tried both the regular outlet and the cigarette lighter one) in my van, 2008 Toyota Sienna.Since I cannot return the item (I threw away the packing slip) I decided to use the original charger head with the new insert tip (excuse my lack of proper terminology). However, after cutting both cables, I found out that the cable I bought consists of 2 cables (black and red), whereas the original Garmin has 9 of them! Needless to say, I had to order the official Garmin kit for my gps (fortunately amazon had it)."
5,Garmin 12-Volt Adapter Cable,Received item within a couple days. It was packaged well and and the price was reasonable. Very satisfied with this purchase.
1,Don't buy,I hate it!!! The power turns on off all the time worst thing I ever bought The one that came with my NAV worked great until my car seat rolled over it on the track and cut it half
3,"Cleans Dust, but noiser than I expected","It is a nice product and larger than I expected when taking it out the box. It also has a droning noise when in the low setting and continues to increase as fan speed increases. I thought it would have been quieter as read on some of the reviews, but it does seem to do a decent job with dust removal."
2,Not as quiet as they claim,"For the price, the unit was too noisy. My unit had a fan that was rubbing, but even aside from that, the motor has a low hum, that was loud enough that the quite fan noise was drowned out by it. If you are sensitive to low motor hum, this may not be the unit for you. I have another $70 Hunter purifier, that is much quieter, and all I hear from it is air sound, no evidence of a motor moving the air."
2,Doesn't remove smell of tobacco smoke,"I smoke a pipe about 3 times a day in my study. After trying a couple of the ionic filters for several years, I decided to try this one. As far as I can tell, it doesn't remove any of the odor of stale smoke. Too bad."
3,eh....so so,"there are so many ingredients for the recipes. if you are new to raw foods, as i am, this book is a bit much. i wasn't inspired as much from this book as others."
2,Great Idea! Great Concept! Fantastic Graphics! Ditsy.,"Yes, I saw this on Food TV and thought, ""Well... this is cool. High energy and skinny and tasty to boot is cool."" and bought into it. The problem is the logistics of exotic fresh produce, If you're on the west coast this book may very well be cool. If you're in the midwest or north country or just plain rural America and you buy this book, pat your dog on the back and fire up a smoke, this book won't work for you. That's one issue. The other thing about this book is, it is ditsy, poorly organized, and extremely frustrating. Not you're standard cook book. For the everyman, this book is an overall certain dissappointment. The recipes may as well be in another language. I thought these issue were just me, and then I sold the book to some vegetarian health type friends of mine. They haven't made anything from the book because of the same issues I just addressed.So west coaster enjoy this book. Everybody else start making sausage."
1,reader review,"the author needs to do more research into what he is eating.Not all wine is considered vegan(Dinner at My House)Maple syrup is a cooked product, but it is an ingredient in his food.the book needs laid out better, with page numbers for where to find how to make his other ingredients that need preped ahead of time and then have all those things put together so that the need to be flipping pages for every other ingredient is deminished. example: to read one recipe i had to find 4 different pages.p18 sais that instead of his ""rejuvilac"", vegitable broth can be used, there is no mention on how to make a broth without the use of a stove top. putting vegitables in water to let them steep just doesn't work"
3,Certainly not fast food,"Although there is no cooking involved, there are not many recipes that are quick. Most are quite involved with a lot of veggies and fruits, herbs and spices needed. Several with many hours of dehydration and days of growing sprouts with a lot of pre-prep. work. On the positive side, the recipes seem to be well written and many sound and look delicious."
2,"Martha Stewart of Raw Foods. Great photos, but all fluff.","This book looks great, but is very light on instruction. This is probably the most complicated recipe book I have ever used. Some recipes reference 2-3 other recipes that have to be created first, each of them require a significant amount of work and time to sprout and dehydrate. You also have to experiment on your own dime to make sure the recipe is going to work because of the lack of instruction."
2,Not very well tested or edited!,"A cookbook (even one for raw foods) should give you enough information to make the foods included. This book just doesn't. My favorite is the recipe for vanilla pudding that lists as ingredients: 1 cup dates, 1/2 cup dates. That's it. Did anyone try the recipes?So many of the recipes require SO MUCH work... and ingredients that are just too hard to find anywhere. I really like the idea a lot -- and the restaurant is amazing. But, this book just seems to be on the high-end of raw foods -- most things take a LOT of effort and a multitude of ingredients. There are problems with several recipes that make me think nothing was reviewed or tested. For food that is so much work... the very least he could do is make sure it was accurate.Not a good book for the above-average interest level raw foody person. I'm a vegan and like the whole raw food thing... but THIS book is a terrible place to start."
3,Ok book in some respects,"This is an ok book. I'd borrow it, not buy. Too expensive. It's got a good introduction to raw foods. The recipes are delicious, but Very difficult to execute. You often have to make 3 or 4 recipes to eat one meal. If you Love to cook then have fun. I don't have that much time to kill. I recommend ""The Raw Gourmet"" for the rest of us."
2,You'll Need Hours For These Recipes,"Buy this book only if you have a lot of time and patience. If you are the typical American at-home cook, I doubt you will find RAW very useful. Yes, the dishes are tasty and healthy, but entirely too complex and time consuming. These recipes are more suited to a restaurant, where prep cooks can slice, dice, peel, soak, and shop. Beware the author, as well--Juliano's self promotion is irritating after a while. Why would I want to see pictures of him jumping for joy in yellow overalls and a cropped shirt? Spare me."
3,"cool ideas, distracting presentation. Not for the beginner","Having already experimented with macrobiotic and vegan lifestyles I can say that I did not find Juliano's recipes intimidating or underexplained. BUT, I did see myself spending every waking moment in the kitchen. My mouth watered just reading through the recipes and so I think I will hang onto this book, BUT, I will definatley have to get another one that helps me ease into raw-fooding a little more gradually.Presentation-wise, I found it very distracting. Julinao looks like he's trying to sell more than his recipes. I'm going to have to go over a few of the photographs with a big fat permenant marker. And it was annoying to have to turn my head to read the vertically oriented text.Not for the beginner."
2,Not for the time crunched,"The photographs in the book are beautiful, but I found the instructions to be vague at times. (I had to refer to a different book on exactly how to sprout buckwheat groats.) The recipes require either a lot of preparation time, or a lot of ingredients. A few require both. All grains are to be sprouted, which requires 3-10 days for the grains to be ready. A lot of the ""cooking"" is done in a dehydrator which can take several hours to a day for the food to be ready. I suppose if you could plan far enough ahead, then it wouldn't be so bad, but the initial start-up put me off trying a lot of the recipes."
2,"Good photography, icky food","I have made about 10 recipes from this un-cookbook. The ingredients are hard to find, the recipes aren't well explained, and the taste is NOT good. If I make a raw oatmeal from this book, my kids won't touch it. If I make a much simpler one from ""raw food made easy for 1-2 people"" or ""raw food, real world"" my kids gobble it up. Same thing for smoothies, crackers, etc. The book is a gem to look at (except for the MANY odd pictures of Juliano). If only the substance added up to the style...."
3,you NEED a dehydrator also,"I saw the author of this book on a show a few years ago and thought it would be a great book, so I asked for it for Christmas. I have never been able to use it as you need a quality food dehydrator to make anything. I just wish it was well noted that you had to have one to use this book."
4,Inspired and interesting but too exotic for comfort food,"I bought this book because I was simply curious about the whole raw food thing. This book is full of photos, which is very important to me for inspiration. How else can you work up an appetite? I might even try some of the recipes. But honestly I do not find them very practical. My husband works 12 hrs or more per day up in the mountains of CO. It's hard, physical work outside and right now it's freezing cold. I think if I were to put a plate of cold, raw, grated veggies in front of him after a long, cold and hard day, he'd probably cry. It's definetly not comfort food.But the book is fun and inspiring to try something new. A must in any cook book collection to cover all areas of cooking."
1,Not For Me,"This book has very long, complicated ingredient lists, and you definiteley need a dehydrater. I also could have done without the half-naked pictures of the author on every other page. I sent it back."
1,Coffee table book,"This book appears to be more aimed at creating a splash than providing any practical guidance on a new dietary approach. The photography is gorgeous. But, it seems to end there. Juliano's basis for this radical dietary approach is pretty much nonsense. In his defense of pure raw vegan practices, he asks: ""how would you like to be boiled alive in water?"" Hmmm. How would you like to be sliced thinly before being chomped by someone? There is a sound defense for raw vegan, but you won't find it here.The recipies are not very practical for those of us who have about 30 minutes to prepare dinner, none to prepare lunch, and maybe three minutes for breakfast. Nice novelty book that should benefit the publisher and author, but little value to the reader."
1,"Beautiful Photos, but Super Complicated and Unrealistic","This was the first book I ever picked up about raw foods from seeing the cover. I knew about it, but didn't know there were recipes or who this Juliano guy was.The pictures looked nice, the recipes sounded like they were taken from some complicated chef's index and the price was pretty steep.I don't know, but maybe this book is not for the average person wanting to dabble in a raw food recipe?Also a lot of the dishes have a ton of salt, nuts, seeds and oil. I like to eat my raw food fresh, not laden with a ton of fat. It makes me feel tired and weighed down.I don't think there's even one recipe I could attempt to make in this book and I know my way around a kitchen. I think it would look good on a coffee table and in theory the recipes sound a little tasty but definitely not for every day or healthy raw food."
3,Good looking recipes..not for everyday...,"I think the recipes in this book are great for special occasions..but if you're looking for recipes for everyday ""real"" life and you're not a professional chef...and you don't have the money to buy a crapload of ingredients for one recipe...or you want raw recipes for when you're on the go..this book is not for you. Some of the ingredients are hard to find as well...I'd rather go to the restaurant."
3,"Gotta know how to ""cook"" to use this.","This book has some really great recipes but unfortunately if you follow along EXACTLY you will end up with something inedible, weird or you get waaay too much!There's a lot of recipes that ask for too much ""soy sauce"" - which of course will make your dish way too salty. Or it calls for too much oil. There are also some bizarre things like the Carrot Cake which says makes ""2 servings"" but really makes 2 CAKES!So when you go along you noticed these typos, or whatever they are, you compensate and then you get really yummy dishes.Despite the problems I like the food in here. Just wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't know how to ""fix"" a recipe..."
3,"good food, poor editing","I tried many of the recipes in this book, and they were wonderful. There were many I could not try because I do not have a food dehydrator, but I eventually will. making these recipes takes a lot of money and work (time consuming) So if you are a very busy person, this may not be for you.the editing could have been much better, there are recipes that call for another recipe in the book, and I noticed wrong page numbers cited, so time then has to be taken to find the right page. remember to have plenty of book marks available for this book because a lot of the recipes call for other recipes, so you are bouncing around a lot in the book."
4,Wow! Great ideas!,"If you are a vegetarian looking for something (please God) new, this is the book for you. His ideas for food and recipes are amazing."
5,Raw eating. The way to go,"Simple recipes. No mess, no much to clean. Food loaded with vitaminsand minerals. Excellent nutrition."
3,Ummm. WAAAY too complicated for beginners..And does this guy want to be a woman?,"I was super excited about getting this book and when I did I first thought, OMG, ""Does this guy want to be a woman... seriously?"" That's beside the point, but the book is filled with ingredients that I'm not quite sure WHERE you find them and is just too much hype. I like [...]. This lady actually teaches at Living Light and explains it from start to finish. Her book and DVD companion are AWESOME!!! Plus, the ingredients are easy to find. You don't need a ton of fancy, high cost equipment either."
2,"Beautiful, if misguided","This is a very lovely book with some interesting recipies, but I don't think the principles behind Juliano's cooking style are particularly sound. Actual scientists and nutritionists find that ""delicate nutrients"" in foods are enhanced/destroyed in cooking, depending on the food. Some foods are best raw, some lightly cooked. I think the best thing to remember is that starting with fresh ingredients is important, and not overcooking and overdressing them is equally so. However, I think Juliano takes these principles to the extreme, so much so that they are counterproductive.To be fair, I'm not really a fan of raw foodists, since I think the principles behind it are a little light on science and some principles sound a little like ritualized eating disorders. However, if you use this book for some interesting and unusual food preparations rather than for gaining a new nutritional perspective, this is an OK book."
5,Best smoothies/drinks I have ever had!,"I am not a big fan of raw food but I had to buy this book after trying several smoothies at Juliano's restaurant Planet Raw. I am telling you, this guy makes the best smoothies on the planet. Try the lemonade with Juliano's secret ingredient--rejuvelac. It is unbelievable, it's well worth the price of the book."
3,Extreme Raw,"I thought the pictures of the food looked great, but the more I read the ingredients in the recipie, the more I found them to be a bit time consuming. For example, the Real Toast or Rye Bread call for sprouted seeds which need to be prepared hours in advance. Real Mayonnaise and Water need to be prepared with additional ingredients in additon to the extensive list of ingredients the recipe calls for. The recipies presented are very unique and delicious, while others need extra time in procuring somewhat obscure ingredients. Basically, prepare ahead of time."
3,Inspiring Recipes,"Pros:* Beautifully presented dishes* Very 'gourmet'* I particularly like the section 'Stocking The Raw Kitchen - very useful* The 'Desserts' section is a real treatCons:* Quite a few recipes require sprouted grains, which are quite time-consuming to prepare.* Lots of dehydrating, which is also time-consuming.* Many recipes are easy to make with an average amount of ingredients. However, some contain as much as 24 ingredients!"
2,"Weak recipes, pretty pictures","I got this book because of the gorgeous pictures and ideas for recipes inside. The recipes, however, are not at all quick, often taking over 45 minutes for preparation alone! It would probably be great for a dinner party with many guests, or someone looking for ""beautiful"" food. However, as a raw/living foods eater, these recipes are not at all practical. I'll be selling my copy as used on amazon and ebay. :("
5,"A Fun Read, Many Delicious Returns!","The book is *beautiful* to look through, and as fun as Miss Piggy's Guide to Life to read. Juliano's humor is much like Frank Oz's! Anyway, this was the first raw cookbook I started making meals with, and it has laid the basics for me to be able to easily comprehend ingredient combos and use many other raw cookbooks. There is an extensive glossary of off the beaten path ingrdients in the back, along with stores and mail order shops for harder to get items. Juliano doesn't hold your hand through everything, and you have to actually pay attention while reading through the recipies to conceptualize portions of some ingredients to select the right amount of produce at market. But hey, it's nice to think after being shown everything so explicitly on cooking t.v. shows, and following some cookbooks where the recipies are itemized like procedures in a nuclear powerplant emergency manual."
2,It's ok there are better books...,"Ok the way I see it, it is interesting enough for newbies or begginers but that is where the book falls short, interesting. But not practical or real or any where near possible. What is the point of getting new people into it then turning them off with daunting and impossible recipes and graphics? I say try other books that are much easier, faster and actually possible, there is a new one by Bryan Au called RAW IN TEN MINUTES the recipes are actually fast, fun and simple, anyone can do it, I did. There is also a few other new ones by Harper Collins that are pretty interesting there is this couple from New York that has a PURE Restaurant, I ate there, WOW! Also I hear Bryan Au is opening his PA~RAW~DISE Restaurant at 587 Post Street on Union Square in San Francisco I want to check that out, I hear it will be AMAZING! Other Raw books I liked was Raw For Busy people, these types of books makes RAW real, easy and fun. That is what real people need!"
2,Impractical,"This book is interesting enough, but unless you live near a very good health foods store and have a good bit of time, many of the recipes are impossible. On one end of the spectrum, there are recipes that require that you prepare other recipes first, which would make sense if you are seriously into raw food- you could use leftovers. But for those of us who are new to raw foods, it comes across as a daunting prospect. On the other end of the spectrum are the recipes for ""cream cheese"" which consists of raw avocado- yep, that's it- no other ingredients, and his recipe for ""butter"" which is olive oil and salt. For most of the recipes, you will need a dehydrator and ample time to plan ahead. I recommend instead ""Delights of the Garden"" which is a much more accessable and user friendly raw cookbook."
5,My Most Used Cook Book Ever,"while this book may be labor intensive at times, there are many recipies that do just whip right up. you don't have to buy their $200.00 dehydrator... wal-mart has one for $40 bucks. Juliano constanltly encourages you to get comfortable with the 'raw method' and then get creative in your own style which after sticking with it i seemed to get it and start my own versions.http://www.veganoutreach.org/whyvegan ...click on the tabs to the left and it just magically makes giving up all meat and dairy a breeze."
1,Bad purchase (and dangerous),"I needed to replace an old microwave and the price and the compact size of the MAGIC CHEF were very attractive. It lasted LESS than two weeks: After 10 days of reasonable use, I smelled a burnt odor, the microwave stopped working, and when I looked at the back of it, a big part has melted. It could have been a fire hazard. I immediately returned it. So, get a different one!"
3,A must for airline buffs,"As a former American Airlines employee, I enjoyed having this book on hand during a recent trip. It had lots of fun facts and figures. I would have liked more details about aircraft, service entry dates, etc. Book obviously was produced with the help of the company so there was little negative info. Should have at least mentioned major incidents."
5,Two Masterpieces of the Imagination,"Creme and Godley, the musical geniuses behind the band 10cc, let their wild imaginations loose on these two brilliant releases from the late 70s. Having them packaged together at a bargain price makes this a ""best buy."" Though infused with technological treatments and state-of-the-art (back then) production values, these are NOT ""techno"" albums at all. They're lush soundscapes with some of the smartest, wryest lyrics ever. These were some of the most experimental songs produced at the time, and they stand the test of time well. Their humor and social commentary remains on target, and the music doesn't sound dated at all. Highly uncommercial, never boring, and sonically brilliant, these two albums will always have an honored spot in my music collection."
3,Compare Chicago to L.A. ?!?,"The L.A. Philharmonic's brass section sounds terrible in their recording. Granted, the interpretation is superior to that of Barenboim's, but I don't like any of Barenboim's Strauss recordings. The L.A. horns are abysmal. They are seldom in tune and have a very whiney tone. Chicago's recording is alright except for Barenboim's extremely slow interpretation. Comparing the CSO's brass section to that of the L.A. Philharmonic is just ridiculous. We all know that the L.A. brass are shaky at best."
1,"Very, Very, Very Disappointing","To put plainly, this brass section VERY old (age-wise) and do not have chops that they did 20, 30, or 40 years ago. Their old lips just can't do it. It's painful to hear Adolph Herseth try and play this insane trumpet part at 70 years old. He just doesn't have it anymore. And he's not the only one. Jay Friedman is starting to decay and sounds really bad in all places: not just the loud parts. Same with Herseth. He uses this nasty vibrato to try cover up his bad tone. The only good part of this recording it Charles Vernon, but Barenboim holds him back. When I first saw this recording, I wanted to get it, too. I said, ""Hey! The greatest brass section ever playing the Alpine Symphony!"" Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed, and you will to if you buy this. I have an LA Phil recording, but I'm not sure when it was recorded or who conducted it, but it is flat out amazing. They can handle this monster. Unfortunately, Chicago can't."
1,Another misfire,"Richard Strauss is territory Barenboim should have stayed away from. When we already have astoundingly marvellous versions of Alpine Symphony available elsewhere - Karajan with the virtuosic Berlin Philharmonic, Kempe and the inspired dedicatees of the work itself, the incandescent Dresden Staatskapelle, and Blomstedt's stupendous San Francisco recording - Barenboim and the sadly unrecognizable CSO are roundly outclassed in this repertoire. One is amazed that this is the same orchestra who worked musical miracles under Reiner and Solti. The playing throughout is bland, limp and uninspired, and the recording is amazing --- muffled, distant and murky."
4,"Santa's grabbag, with some stunning music","this is a great addition to your Christmas music, and there are some cuts that you will pull out the rest of the year, because they are masterpieces. (That is, if you can stand listening to Christmas tunes during the rest of the year.) Sleigh Ride is excellent, with Sam Bush and Darrell Scott playing beautiful western swing style. In the Bleak Midwinter is an exquisite partnership between Molly O'Brien's beautiful voice and control and Jerry Douglas's usual haunting brilliance. Chris Thile, accompanied by Stuart Duncan though the liner doesn't credit him, does a great job with Bring a Torch. The last cut -- Merry Christmas from the family is accurately praised in the Amazon review -- it's a delight. Other cuts on the disk are also worth the price."
1,It's ok,"I was pretty impressed with the photography in the book, but that's about it. SOme of the stories were ok but didn't seem to flow. If your looking for quality graveyard pictures than you'd enjoy this book. Otherwise your better off looking for another book to read. I think she was better off writing about folklore than taking up a project like this book."
5,Contents:,"A summary of the doctrines of evangelical theology underlying Christian stewardship. The incentive for this book came from a series of lectures the author gave in 1954 at the Joint Dept. of Stewardship and Benevolence of the National Council of Churches held in Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio."
4,FUN FUN FUN,This is one of the best songs I haev heard in a long time. It's happy and upbeat. You can dance to it. It put's a smile on your face. Give it a try! Its fun
4,Joyful concertos,"Scharwenka's Piano Concerto No 1 in B-flat minor begins boisterously like the arrival of friends already in party mood and continues in sometimes quiet but always cheerful spirit. Scherzo introduces a giggling theme that becomes a dance with a catchy tune that bounces round your head for days. Serious drama arrives in the final movement gradually resolving into joyful song.Concerto No 2 in C Minor has rhapsodic opening and closing movements separated by a gentle adagio. The closing section shows Sharwenka at his showy and rambunctious best. Splendid piano playing is supported by enthusiastic, committed and muscular orchestral sound. These are zesty and enjoyable performances that endear themselves with repeated playing."
2,"Recording Good, but no match for the Competition","I bought this recording hoping for the best. I have Wild and Tanyel for the first concerto plus Tanyel for Concerto No.2 and of course, Raymond Lewenthal for the last movement of the 2nd. My love for Tanyel's recording of the 2nd concerto will last forever-one of her best recordings. This recording is ok, but I miss the viruosity and muscularity of Tanyel's readings. I prefer Wild in the 1st concerto to either. Tanyel's first is hard to come by since Collins classics became defunct-hopefully Hyperion will rerelease it. I would try this one before you buy like I did."
5,Ghosts in the Windows,"The CD is terrific. It is one of the best that I've heard in a long time. It's a must add for every collection, no matter what kind of music you listen to!"
5,"FUN, CREATIVE & ENERGETIC","""I love this DVD and the Dance and Be Fit series with Kimberly. She is very perky and lovely to watch and listen to. The production is very well-done: the stylish stage setting; pretty girls and wardrobe as well as the accompanying music. Aside from that, the menu offers a dance-like warm-up and 2-20 minute workouts. I really enjoy doing the ""Heavenly Hips"" because of the slower pace and you get to do the movements many times and you'll end up working your total body. For a more up tempo routine, you'll be doing lots of kicks and slightly more complicated moves on the ""Lovely Legs."" Overall, Kimberly makes dancing lively and fun with her consistent smiling, offers helpful tips on body placement, and leads such a feminine, freeing workout!"""
2,Dance experience required...,"This DVD was just Ok, It was not that easy to follow and I have taken dance lessons."
1,Awful workout,"Boring choreography, poor cuing, annoying voice! I am constantly searching for workouts that trim my lower body without bulking it up and thought I had finally found one with Lower Body Burn. Not at all! Unless you are an extreme beginner, this hardly counts as a workout. My heart rate never went up, the choreography is tedious, and the voice of the instructor is whiny and unpleasant. The ""Heavenly Hips"" section is just a vast amount of hip shaking and swiveling - it is not designed to actually impact one's hips. The leg section is poorly cued and dull. I have finally learned to never purchase another workout dvd produced by Acacia or Gaiam."
3,nice but not a hot burn,"Nice smile, nice voice, she is very sympathetic but I wouldn't say I felt the burn. It is a nice exercice but not more than that."
4,Unique,"All i can tell you is that this cologne is different, no amount of explanation can describe the smell. You just have to find out for yourself. But i can tell you one thing ""its unique"" and you will definitely be separated from the pack. And strangely it really does attract the attention of the ladies ""more than you know!!!!!!""."
2,Expected more,"I expected more since I've used the same before. The knob to push was not in the same quality of the last one I got. And the smell of the last one is not equal as well. It still good but not in the same way it used to be years ago, maybe they changed the formula."
1,I think that is not authentic,"I compared this product with others that should be equal and I can see that the button to spray is totally different, one is rubber with the name in embossed while this is a rigid plastic button that makes it difficult to spray. Assessing another aspect, the smell does not last as long as it does the other with which I made the comparison and have a difference in the aroma. I have purchased many products through Amazon and have always preferred in which they are sellers, but this time I have my doubts about the quality of this product."
4,Weinberg gets it...,"Where does creativity come from? How do writers ""come up with their ideas""? What's the best process to follow for success in this business?Weinberg hasn't got all the answers, and a lot of what he says flies in the face of the 'traditional' process... but for me, this was an eye-opening book because it showed me that my own personal process closely mirrored Weinberg's - and while so many others have tried to dissuade me from doing things ""my way"", toward doing them ""properly"", I discovered through Weinberg that not only was my method valid - but there was even a name for it. The Fieldstone Method.Moreover, I was able to use Weinberg's method to improve the way I write, by learning from his experience and adapting his techniques to my own.The book isn't for everyone, but it is full of clever tips, and I believe the method works. You'll know by reading the description whether this is something you, personally, can benefit from."
2,No ninjas,"Not only no ninjas, but that shot of Bruce 'Le' with a machine gun doesn't show up in the mvoie either. Basically Bruce Le is called in to handle a case and it is basically him just getting in one fight after the other. It was Nice Cheung, even in a limited rle. James Nam is decent as the Karate master and Lo Lieh has a cameo and also my favorite fight of the movie. The final fight with Kong Do is hardly worth watching but a female karate cop helped to get me through this movie for the full 86 minutes. Overall it is clear that Bruce Le is a good action choreographer, he just sucks at actually performing the action. Recommended for people who want a fight filled movie that it barely a step above of the standard chop and block.Picture quality is full screened but watchable."
4,Suspensful and a Thrill a Minute,"A well written novel filled with suspense that leaves the reader wondering who the murderer is throughout most of the book. Rance Gregory has created a narrative that introspects into how abuse of power, money and political influence can alter the course of events and human interactions forever."
5,"The ""Owners Manual"" to Real Estate investing","No fancy, tricky get rich schemes. Nothing for free and no wild illusions or promises. Rock solid nuts and bolts to real estate investing. A great book which pulls no punches on ""how-to-do-it"" in real estate. It takes time, money and knowledge to reach financial freedom - that is reality! This book is the knowledge you need to meet that goal in less time and with less money. An absolute ""Must Read"" in a step-by-step format. The ""owners manual"" to your fianancial future."
5,Great Book!,From the Rat Race to Real Estate is an excellent source of information for first time investors. The book shows you how to build a strong team of professionals to assist you in the purchasing and renting of real estate. I highly recommend it for people who are uncertain about investing.
5,From the Rat Race to Real Estate,"This book is packed with tips and ideas on every page, there is no fluff. It walks you through, step by step, the entire real estate investing process and teaches you how to financially protect your investment. The book is well written and easy to read. If you're serious about making money in real estate, this book is a must."
3,Bedroom Doorbell,"My daughter loves this. The two parts - the ringer and the button are connected by a wire, which is a pain, but I don't know how you get away from this. All the doorbells I reviewed had a wire. This one is cute - matches my daughter's bedroom. We hung the ringer behind her door and the wire goes through the crack in the door. The button has a sticky back so it plugs right on to the door. The wire is draped across the front of the door, but my daughter doesn't mind. It fits its purpose."
3,Adorable accessory,This doorbell is just what my Daughter wanted for her room. It's very nice looking and works well.
3,Not what I expected but the girls love it,"Bought these for my 2 and almost 5 year old girls for christmas. It's a wonderful idea and very cute, paired this with telephones that work like walkie talkies and they have their own little ""appartments."" I whole heartedly agree that the doorbell chime is annoying and loud, not quite what I had hoped it would sound like. When you consider the intended user however they don't seem to mind one bit. With the door closed it does make it fun as the little tike on the outside pressing the button can hear it just fine.Of greater concern to me is that it doesn't light up the way they said it would. It did on Day One - tried new batteries but didn't make a difference. To me this is a major inconvenience as it was an item purchased online and the exchange for this feature is too much of a hassel.Would be great if they had a volume control and chime selection options - of course the cost of doing this might inflate the price tag too much to make it a marketable item."
4,PERFECT GIFT FOR A LITTLE GIRL,PERFECT GIFT FOR A LITTLE GIRL WHO LIKES PRIVICY. MY LITTLE GIRL LOVED SOMEONE RINGING THE BELL TO LET THEM IN.
3,Too loud!,My 5 year old sister has fun with it but it is WAY TOO LOUD!!!!!I also think there should be a wireless version - the cord keeps getting caught in her door!
4,My daughter thinks it's awesome,"This doorbell is a hit with my daughter. She is 9 and loves the idea of having people knock before they enter her room. The ring is a little annoying but thankfully her room is far away from my ears.One funny thing is that the electric currents in the wall have set it off before, so we had to move the sensor away from light switches or we would hear the doorbell whenever the light was turned on or off.The cord is long enough to easily put the butterfly inside the room and the button outside."
3,"Beware the ""chime""","I ordered 5 of these for nieces and my own two daughters for Christmas. While it is a very unique gift idea, the ""chime"" leaves something to be desired. I envisioned a charming magic-wand type of tinkling sound when you pressed the doorbell, but what came out was more along the lines of a fire-engine siren. Also, the body of one of the butterflies came off and had to be re-adhered. Not a big deal, but not the quality expected of ""Santa."" If I were to purchase again, I would get something more pleasing to the ear."
2,My Doorbell is Possessed,The doorbell is cute and my daughter loved it at first! This thing goes off by us just walking in the room. It freaks her out now because it will go off at night when we are going into her room for bed. If it didn't do that it would be a nice accessory to her room.
4,Nice cargo,Works great and operates smoothly. Was purchased for my 4 year old son who loves trains and he thinks it goes great with his train.
2,constantly breaking,"Did I get a bad batch? These pencils break constantly! Sometimes the tip breaks off after coloring for 30 seconds, and other times it breaks off right in the sharpener. I tried leaving just a teeny amount above the wood but anymore than that it just breaks off over and over. My kids 8 and 10 try to be careful, and I just can't understand why these pencils won't last longer. I bought Crayola for the name but we've sharpened away about half of them after just a few pictures. Very disappointing."
5,Are they be bad?,The 12 pack set is one of my favorites. The case is small and holds together well. (i wish they made a 12 pack in a metal case so it would last forever but the paper case goes bad about the time i need new one's anyway.
1,Broken,"I bought these pencils at a local store because I couldn't wait on the other, higher quality, pencils I ordered here. It's very frustrating to try and use them. I sharpen them, go to use the new point, and the lead is broken 1/4"" inside the pencil. Re-sharpen, and the results are the same. Spend your money on a higher quality pencil, and wait for that quality product to arrive at your door."
2,"Cheap Price, Cheap Performance - You get what you pay for","I purchased the Crayolas (along with the 24-color pack of Crayolas) over the Berol Prismacolor (to save some money) to color an Anatomy coloring book for school. Big mistake. The Crayolas are made of a harder substance and thus the colors do not easily glide onto the paper as is the case with Berols. This is important when you need to be precise in coloring small detail. Thus it took a lot longer to color a page, not mention the higher difficulty level and frustrations that accompany the coloring experience.Now if the coloring objective is for small children's coloring books, then these Crayolas are fine for these needs. But if you're an adult or need to color something more sophisticated, go with the Berols!"
1,Amazon says this part fits a 2003 Pontiac Vibe (base) but it doesn't,"I purchased these drums for my wife's 2003 Pontiac Vibe (base model) which I found by searching for brake drums for her car. Amazon told me that these drums would fit. They do not. Specifically, they match the hub's lug nut pattern, but when installed and torqued, only about 4 threads of the studs are actually grabbed by the lug nuts. As a result, it appears as though these drums fit; however, only 4 threads of grip is insufficient (should be around 12 - 13 threads)."
4,Too late!,I wish I had come across this information before I got my first credit card. Thank you for the valuable tips.
5,A Superlative Banjo Album,"A formidable bluegrass album that includes many outstanding instrumentals, enough to be considered an instrumental album. Lots of banjo driven instrumentals including my personal favorites of Ernest T. Grass, Allen's Dream and Cross Road Blues. The latter being a blues driven banjo tune.But more than a banjo album, this is a bluegrass album. With some exceptional bluegrass songs including two superb efforts in ""Mountain Girl"" with Junior Sisk on lead vocals and Ronnie Bowman and Dan Tyminski on harmonies. A tale of young love in the mountains. And the excellent ""Without A Word"", a wonderful gospel song co-written by Marty Stuart and one of my favorites on the disc with the thought provoking lyrics in presents.This CD is comparable to any Lonesome River Band (which Sammy plays banjo for) CD that I own and I highly recommend it."
1,DOES NOT FIT 2009 F-150 Supercrew!,"These did not fit, although amazon stated it would. Now I have to try to get my money back. BEWARE as the Amazon fitting structure is WRONG."
5,equal to volume I,"This C.D. like Volume I before it is a very high quality, wonderfully diverse album. The pair compliment eachother beautifully, and stand alone strong. I would recomend it to anyone who already loves Opera, and to any new innitiate. I bought Vol. I and Vol. II on a whim and have not been sorry. The piece by Wagner at the end is worth the purchase price alone for this one."
4,Pretty and enjoyble once you get it together,"Got it for my shower, matched with the other items I ordered.Thought it was so so to put together (I still didnt put the basket on as well as the ""play toy thingy"" and I am storing away the rubber tray that goes onto of the plastic tray which goes onto of a snack tray )It seemed ridiculous while putting together (all the extra frills and foo foo things) but now that it is intact, (somewhat)My daughter seems very comfy, eats well in it, it is easy to clean and love the wheels!"
1,disappointing,i am so upset with this product. we recieved this high chair as a gift for our baby shower. when my husband went to put it together he found that the part that attaches the leg of the chair to the seat was totally broke off. so we returned it for a different one. and wouldn't you know it when he went to put it together again the same exact part was broken off again. i can't beleive it. could you imagine of my child was in it and it broke off then?if i could i would have given this product no stars at all. needless to say we will be getting a different brand when we return it.
4,Its an ok high chair....,The things i found to be wrong with the high chair is the 1 hand release doesn't work very well and it doesn't roll very well + the toy bar never will stay on.
2,Too many bells and whistles - not functional,"We bought this highchair because it matched the infant seat, swing and pack-n-play. The chair has too many bells and whistles - we just wanted something for the babies to eat in. Difficult to put together and the booster seat is not functional. We never used it - our 5 month olds twins' legs could not fit under the tray with the booster seat in and they needed the booster seat because they were not tall enough. It does not roll easily on tile with grout and the recline feature is difficult to use. Also, the play bar falls off all the time. Not a very good highchair for the money."
3,Graco High Chair,"This high chair served it's purpose, but it was big & bulkey and almost impossible to adjust. Assembling was a pain for my husband. We did not use the attachments. We bought it to match our Pack and Play (which also had more features than we ended up using). Wish we had purchased something simpler, smaller and one that folds up better."
3,Didn't Work For Us,"I purchased this high chair for two reasons; first the pattern is pretty and matches our infant seat and stroller, and second the description claims that the chair is designed so that the tray will fit over your table. Unfortunatly the tray does not fit over our table although it is of average height (30 inches). In addition, the seat back did not adjust easily and sometimes it would not adjust at all. One very nice aspect to this high chair is the infant booster seat which works quite well. In the end we had to return this high chair due to the lack of fit with our table and the amount of space the legs took up."
1,Poor customer service,"No to mention the recline feature on my high chair is next to impossible to work, my seat pad fell apart after a few washings. This highchair was only a month old. When I contacted graco they so kindly told me that a new seat cover can be purchased for $35!!!!Very dissappointed."
2,Not the best that it could be....,"Being a new mom (b/g twins), I wanted nothing but the best for my babies. We chose the Graco Colby and Graco Harmony highchairs. Loved the idea of being able to recline the seats. We have purchased a lot a products (double everything!) from Graco; by far I do not think these highchairs are worth the price that Graco is asking for them. The ""one-handed"" recline seat is more like two or three handed!! The wheels don't roll all that well, it's more like dragging the highchair across the floor!! The tray does not go close enough to the babies either. I have been pleased with everything else from Graco. I think they need to go back to the design studio and reengineer all of the ""one-handed"" features. If I had it to do all over again I would purchase two Fisher-Price highchairs instead of these two from Graco!! One good feature is the 3 or 5 point harness system (the release button is the only one-handed feature that actually works)."
4,Works well for infants,"I like this highchair for my daughter. She can sit easily in it, since it has an infant booster seat. I also like that you can choose to use either the 3 or 5 point harness. The reclining feature is not good though and I never assembled the toy bar. I figured I didn't need that. Overall, I love that it is on wheels, the height adjustment is good and the infant booster is wonderful. Decent seat."
4,Good but not terrific,When I registered for this product I was SO excited about all the features and for the most part it has lived up to expectations. My only real complaint is that the recline mechanism is a little choppy and you have to really pull hard to get it to work. Other than that I'm fairly pleased.
1,Didn't Work Not Blue Either,Well I ordered this for my 3 year old son as he is fascinated with flash lights and thought this would be a fun toy for him. Well it worked for all of a few minutes turned off and never turned on again. I tried replacing the batteries and the bulb but no luck. It's not even worth trouble to send an [...] purchase back so oh well...On a side note I ordered this thinking I would receive a blue color lamp but got a purple one. I guess you can't choose a color they just send whatever...
4,it is the sun of east,Can you feel any logical sensation with the so called mysticism.Ghazzali was the best practician of the logic upon mysticism.Ghazzali was not only a master of the recent affairs throughout the islamic world but also his sctriptures were extremely donated along the western humanities and the philosophy of renaissance.Ghazzali was the eclectic face of the last thousand years in the eastern world.
3,Disappointing Very poorly organized,"Poor index, no cross referencing of terms, not enough pictures, etc. i was going to return this one for sure, but Amazon didn't even want it back! I particularly wanted info on short row techniques, this term is not in the index I have since discovered that it can also be referred to as wrap and turn or W&T. There is a question on short row shaping but until I discovered the term wrap and turn in another book, then found that term in this book in the index, turned there and found a very inadequate description of the process.. None of this information was found in this book! This applies to almost all searches, just not helpful enough. ( Teach Yourself Knitting Visually by Sharon Turner ASIN:047052832X) is just sooo much better at answering questions clearly, and with great visuals to boot! Save your money and spend it elsewhere."
5,Best Knitting Book Around,"I started knitting about 1 year ago. I am self taught and this book has been a life saver. I still take it with me whereever I knit ""just in case"". A must have!"
4,Knitting Answer Book,"I like the format of this book; however it's size is too small. Some may appreciate its smaller size because it would be more ""portable,"" allowing it to be included with the bag or whatever a knitter carries a project and yarn and needles around in when traveling, etc. A matter of personal preference."
3,the knitting answer book,i love the book it was trumendisly helpful me and my 9 year old sister and her friends have enjoyed using it !
5,A Beginner's Bible!!!,"A terrific resource for beginners, but clearly a handy reference for knitters of all skill levels - even highly commended by my knitting coach who is a veteran skilled knitter of decades! Easy to read format, love the heavy weight pages which keep the book open. A perfect gift accompaniment to knitting classes or gifts of knitting supplies. Small size fits nicely into a knitting bag too."
4,Very useful,This book is full of good information for knitters - written in easily understood language and organized in a user-friendly manner.
5,Buy this book!,"This is the best reference book I have for knitting. If you're looking for a good problem-solving book, buy this one!"
5,Great Guide for Knitters,"I find this little ""pocket"" guide very helpful. I have not been able to knit much, and when I do I sometimes forget a certain technique. I just flip through this book and pick up the skill in no time. I learned how to knit in the round from this book, and I find it's instruction easy to understand."
5,A must to keep handy,Whether you are a new knitter or one with much experience this book has all the answeres for any question you might have. Stuck on a type of stitch or not sure if you are following the pattern properly this small but packed book of answers make life a whole lot easier when you hit a snag!
3,Good Content Mostly - Index Difficult!,"Most of what is contained in this book is very useful, but the index is non-intuitive and I find it very hard to find what I'm looking for when I'm looking up something specific. The book's content is organized in a way that does make sense overall, but the index is missing lots of key words to match up to sections that one might try to find. I find it great to browse through when I'm looking for nothing in particular, but when I reach a point where I need to figure out something in a knitting pattern or technique . .well more often than not, I can't find it in the index, but DO eventually find it in the book. I've actually resorted to writing in my own notes in the index to help me remember where to find things I might look up more than once."
4,Handy little reference book,"This is certainly not the most exciting of knitting books <no fancy photos or full color beautiful projects> but it is a handy little book for a knitter to have around (at least a beginning one like me) I have consulted it several times on things like how to measure gauge, fixing mistakes, how to knit into the stitch below, etc. It is set up in sections based on skills, like chapter one is casting on and chapter 4 is binding off. In chapter 1, they discuss several different cast on methods with illustrations of how to do them, then they have a common questions and answer sections. For example, in the casting on chapter they ask what is the best cast on for sweaters? For scarves? For socks? etc. They also have a problem solving section that asks questions like what if my cast on is too tight, how can I fix it? This book is a small little book about 4X6 in size and is a great little reference manual."
4,Handy reference,This is a great little reference book to toss in your knitting bag when you are travelling. It is small and light yet packed with clear pictures and instructions. It's organized well and will answer many of your knitting questions.
2,Disappointing,"If a book is going to give you solutions for every knitting problem, then it should have understandable solutions for a simple cabling question. I had to go to five different spots to find out what a simple cabling term meant. I never did find it - not in the terminology section, not in the two small sections on other cabling issues - no where. I had to go to the internet.Also the few pictures are not well done and the placement of important information such as terminology is not logical. I would think that terminology would be one of the first sections, but in this book it is close to the end.I very well may give the book away."
5,everyone knitter should have one!,Gave it to my daughter for Christmas. She says every knitter should own one. The best by far!
4,The Knitting Answer Book:,"The only reason I can't give this book five stars is because I haven't read it yet. However, it is easy to follow and it fits perfectly in my bag. I can easily take this book with me during my morning commute which means I'm more likely to read it."
4,All those little things....,"I am a relatively new knitter...have done some hats, scarves, baby sweaters etc but as I'm starting to branch out I find I am becoming more anal...I don't like the step I get when casting off on a shoulder or trying to pick the right cast on for a specific project. Well, any question I've had is covered in this book. I love it and keep in in my knitting bag all of the time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I don't like having to look up my question in the index but the answers have all been in there so far."
4,"Knitting, your answers","This book, tho not bad, is not quite what I thought it would be, I thought it would be answers to qustions such as: I have lost my stitches how do I pick them up, but tho relevan to knitting, I was a tad disappointed, but i will get over it.. the condition of the book is exellent, and was delivered in record time, I was told mid Jan - Feb, i got it before Christmas.. very good service"
3,"The basics covered, okay for novice knitters","As an experienced knitter, I found this book somewhat disappointing. It does cover all the basics, so it would be handy for someone who hasn't been knitting a long time--it would be a good initial reference book. I found it somewhat difficult to find what I was looking for, and the rather stiff binding was annoying"
2,Not for beginners,"While this book probably covers every question you may have, it does not have very many illustrations. In other words this book is not for the visual learner like me. Many of the answers, I have not idea without a picture illustration what she is talking about.I would say that it is a must have if you are an experienced knitter that understands what without the visual to complement the written explanation."
5,FAQ-tacular,"This book is amazing. It seriously delivers on its promise to have solutions for every problem and answers to every question. It answered questions I didn't even know I had (and made me more excited about knitting!). One particular question that I hadn't even thought about: How can you tell what fiber is in a yarn if it doesn't have a label? Ms. Radcliffe went into detailed description on how to do a burn test of a small amount of the yarn and determine the main fibers by how the yarn burned, what it smelled like, and what color the ashes would be. Crazy cool. :-) I use knittinghelpdotcom for help with particular stitches (I learn better from videos), but this book is excellent for answering all those little questions. It'll always be in my yarn basket with my current projects."
3,Small book,This book had a lot of information but I found it hard to handle in its bound form. It would have been easier to refer to if it were spiral bound.It is a very small book but full of information.
5,Very informative,I really found this book to be very informative especially with some of the hard problems. I would recommend this book as a supplement for any person who likes to knit. I think sometimes it is hard to search through so many books on the shelf when you run into a problem with a pattern or casting off or on. It is simple and straight forward with chapters written to help find the answer quickly.
2,NOT PRACTICAL,"I bought this book and what a mistake! I gave it 2 stars, but really would like to give it none. The only reason I gave it 2 was because a lot of people (given the previous reviews) seem to find it useful. The most useful thing I have learned from this book is to never buy a knitting book without using it first (from the library or a friend). Take a technique you would like to learn and see if the book describes it in a way you can understand. VOGUE KNITTING IS FAIRLY GOOD, but for a large reference, the best I have found so far is THE ULTIMATE KNITTERS BIBLE. The pictures are large and I can actually go from the book to utilizing the instructions in a real project. Each time I have a question I look at all of my reference books. I have never found The Knitting Answer Book understandable. P.S. I have a graduate degree and don't consider myself to be stupid."
3,You can find all of this information on the internet for free,Why waste money buying this book when you can get all of this information for free on the internet? If I didn't have internet then this book would be great to have. I have checked this book out at the library when I first started knitting and was disappointed to learn that all of the information from the book can be found for free on the internet by doing a Google search.
5,The Knitting Bible,"All hail this Bible of the Knitting world. Every question you want to know really is within its pages. I use it almost every day and it hasn't once been stumped.Most answers come with illustrations, which I like, but most are cartoons. Real pictures would have been better, but hey, I'm not going to sit here and slam one of the greatest tools I've ever used to help with knitting. Maybe the author will do this with a future edition.You won't be sorry with this purchase and it makes a PERFECT gift for ANY knitter, regardless of experience."
5,The title says it all,"My first copy of this book was a gift. Knowing that it was perfect for a knitter of any skill level,I had to give it to my grand daughter who was just learning. I tried to get along without it, but quickly realized I couldn't. The title really does say it all."
3,Nice basics,"This is a nice basics book, but lacking in diagrams and more advanced questions. Recommned for beginners, but more advanced knitters may find it less useful."
3,Attention!!! Wrong discription!!!,"In the description it says this is SIX episodes disc. Wrong!!!Instead there are only FIVE of them.They are all fun to watch, BUT our favorite one(the reason we bought it on DVD) is missing.I don't understand why they would record five and miss one, but it should be at least described right!!!"
3,Fun but dubious,"My son loves insects and everything that has to do with them. He loves Bug Wars, but I'm not sure how authentic these scenarios are. Think about it: a branch full of wasps accidentally falls on a colony of vicious ants just as a film crew happens to be crawling around the jungle looking for bug on bug carnage?"
4,An eye opener,This bible brought helped guide me in my endeavor to engage myself in my religion. It was easier to read and understand than some of the other versions that I have read.
4,These songs have a great beat & you can dance to them,"""American Bandstand"" was certainly a forerunner to the modern day music video-It enabled us to see our favorite performers up close & personal-Dick Clark brought us all the big names:Buddy Holly,Jerry Lee Lewis,Stevie Wonder,The Beach Boys,Jefferson Airplane,Creedence Clearwater Revival,The Jackson Five,Prince,& even Madonna-This set gives you most of the big hits from the 50's to the 80's-With the exception of ""The Twist"",""Worst That Could Happen"" & ""White Rabbit"",all the songs in this collection are the original versions as you remember hearing them on the radio-A definite must purchase for any oldies fan."
4,American Bandstand & pop culture,"American Bandstand has got to be the best music show ever. I had the chance to talk to a dancer who was in her teens at the time. She sais her favorite year was 1964 which is mine.I'm a little disappointed about the fact there is very few 70's. Also I'm disappointed about ""I Get Around"" being there insted of ""Don't Worry Baby."" Thats why I gave it 4 stars.I love Bandstand and I love this cd. I just think it should have more."
2,Another Travel Guide,"Paget has produced a simple travel guide for those visiting the British battlefields on the Peninsula with battlemaps, orders of battle and some general remarks on the armies and their commanders. If you must have a travel guide I recommend Ian Robertson's WELLINGTON AT WAR IN THE PENINSULA. Paget came out of the Guards - so there you go."
3,somewhat disappointed,"The item shipped was not the one shown in the picture. Apparently, the cart is manufactured by Narita Trading Company. My cart was shipped from Opa-Locka Hardware Corp. in Florida. The stated weight on the product manual is 9 lbs. The cart did not come with any hooks or other means to attach it to a supermarket shopping cart. It was reasonably easy to assemble, but is a bit flimsy. So far, it has held up under the weight of two moderately-loaded shopping bags; we'll see how it does with full loads containing 1-gallon milk containers and other heavier items."
4,Interesting read,We are heading to travel to kyushu (second trip to japan) so this book enhanced my understanding of the japanese people (primarily related to the local/ countryside) and their culture from the angle of gaijin teacher. Enjoy the story a lot that I continue with moichido.
3,The site doesn't give the specs so I had to order them to find out the size,"No specs either here or on Raybestos' website. Really lousy to not include something so basic. Since local parts stores can't get the right lugnut I ordered a set of these.Here's the specs of these so you don't have to order them just to see if they're compatible:Outer nut: fits 13/16"" socketBolt: 1/2"" - 20 threadMade in China. Feel light and cheap with surface chrome mediocre at best. I don't expect them to last long at all."
3,Power of Three,"I attended this show and did not miss the big band (Big Bland) thing at ALL. I'm just sorry I have yet to see any really excellent Todd in-concert videos.For someone like me who wasn't around when Todd was rocking in the 70s it was an eye-opener. This band played so well together they didn't need any extra anything. And it was cool to hear something besides Hello It's Me. Five stars for the performance, wish I could give the DVD the same."
3,Good Enough,"I saw several of these shows and this video doesn't do them justice. While it's musically sound, it doesn't capture any of the energy from the crowd. It's kind of sterile in it's presentation but the trio rocks. Lot's of Todd guitar which is why it's worth buying. The theater shows on this tour just didn't have the crackling vibe that the bar shows did and this comes across as a theater show. If they had recorded the added, spur of the moment show from the Chameleon Club in Lancaster, PA, you could crank that up, rattle your walls and your brain, and really get a feel for what this tour was all about. That said, it's still a nice musical momento."
3,Edited Hard Core movie,This movie is a Private release for Penthouse DVD. Private created a triple X movie then edited it for Penthouse to realese as a softcore movie. Unfort for us the edited version lacks in sex appeal and is not overly erotic. Private uses very hot women in the movie but we don't always get to see as much as we would like. Plot ? What plot it's edited porn. Not a bad effort but could have been so much better.
1,warped,"The board is warped/not level. Ordered a second one and it is less warped than the first, but still warped enough to not be level. Neither cutting board is usable. Am returning both."
1,Pieces missing and board cracked.,"The cutting board I got was cracked. I thought it might be a result of rough handling during transport, but there are also pieces missing that can't be found in the package. Since it was considered to be a Christmas gift for a friend I will have to go to a store and get another one. I will not have time to send it back and get a new one before Christmas."
3,Grooved cutting board,"Bamboo is a very strong wood and this cutting board is our 4th such product. However, it is the only one with the groove around the boarder for juices when cutting a roast or bird. It does the job beautifully, but wish is were larger."
3,18x12x1=NOT,I give this cutting board three stars because it is a nice board. I'm very disappoint that is only 18x12x maybe 3/4 of an inch or even 5/8.
4,Great cutting board!,"Nice product! Handsome with a decent heft. It does require some maintenance in drier climates. Some small splinters will shed throughout its use, I've noticed. All in all I find it to be a splendid renewable replacement to hardwood cutting boards. Thanks!"
3,A good effort for four years out the game.,"Skee-Lo delivers on this album, four years after his debut 1996 release. Although this album is new, it is still the fact of Skee-Lo in the ""I Wish"" video that is constant throughout which makes this album worth a mediocre three stars."
5,He continues in the same tradition.,"This CD continues the same sound tradition he is well-known for. Among my favorites are, ""I have found the way"", ""Let my life be a light"", and ""The gloryland way."" Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver will continue to be a favorite among his listeners."
3,"Fair, same old, same old","This is the first one we owned. It was great...until we bought three or four more and realized that ALL of them sound the same, now it's boring."
5,Great Video!!!!,I was impressed with this product. I couldn't find it anywhere else so I was very happy when I saw it. If you like the good old southern gospel music its definitely a good buy!! It even has Old Jim Hamill in it.
1,Very Weak,"Basically this article has nothing to offer - a total fluff piece. Surpised that Amazon is making me write more words for my review, ok, simple minded, lacking (Amazon) editorial review at any level - stick to selling other people's books, etc"
5,Great,"Wonderful! My first graphic novel, and I will be reading more. Artworks is exceptional and the story is very cool."
3,Great story,Great story arc - rivals the best of Conan in print. I however am not a fan of the new style of art. The glossy depictions just go a bit against the mental image I have of the character. But to each his own.
5,Another great Conan,This is a compilation of various of Conans adventures when he was young. Great reading
2,Graphic SF Reader,"The stories here are ok--they should be, as one of them is a straight Howard take.However, I have a big problem with the artwork. The painted, somewhat pastel at times indistinct style makes Conan look like an eyeless kobold at times, and at others like big-eyed wild madmen all over the place. Non-inked fuzzy style looks crappy, to me.Growing up with Barry Windsor-Smith this is a change much for the worse.I won't be reading any more of this with the same art style."
4,If ever a man was born for something...,"An autobiography of a true warrior and hero told by the men who worked and fought alongside him. Coming off the family farm and joining the South African merchant marine at age 15, he was influenced to join the Royal Air Force in the 1930's. He not only accepted the challenges put before him, but distinguished himself as a tireless leader. Judging from the comments of his peers, he was hands-down the best shot among fighter pilots of his time."
5,Understanding Robert Shaw's Joy to the World,"Other reviewers in this space have been critical of the sound quality of this recording. They are quite correct that, compared to today's standards -- or even those of the 1960s -- the quality of this recording is terrible. The recording, however, was made in the late 1940s and released on 78s. For THAT time, I think the quality is phenomenal. The performances have held up well over the years, as well, with that characteristic Robert Shaw ""one voice"" sound. The tonal shading is as precise as the diction. Listen for it; this level of precision and nuance (perhaps a little over-emphasized to make up for the recording technology) is as rare today as it was then. For basic carols performed in 4 part a capella, it just doesn't get any better than this."
1,Exceptionally poor remastering,"There is probably no chorale ensemble in the U.S. better than the Robert Shaw Chorale. I realize that this is a re-release of recordings originally made in the 1960s, but I have higher expectations. There is a good deal of hiss and high-pitched background noise, and at least one track starts with the sound of the tape slowly starting. Someone was not paying attention in the sound booth when they were doing the digitalization. If this is your first experience with the Robert Shaw Chorale, you'll never come back. Try ""Songs of Angels"" or ""Angels on High"" first -- these are more recent recordings, but they show what the Chorale could do. There is almost nothing of merit in this CD."
1,Disappointing,"The sound quality of this recording is really poor. I realize the source tape is the cause of this, but it seems that it was engineered very strangely, the sound has a muffled quality to it.Also, the songs are done in ""medley"" fashion, rather than as individual works.Get ""Christmas with Robert Shaw"" instead."
4,"rich, tasty food without the fat","This small book contains a very nice assortment of spreads and dips. Many are quite fast and easy to prepare, and all have substantially reduced fat content. Despite the trimming of fat, the ones I've tried are very rich in taste, and won raves from guests at a recent party. The price is a bit high (I borrowed a copy from the library), but I liked it so much that I may buy my own copy."
3,"a long gossipy email - fun,silly, and empty","Having not read Blimey! I hope it was better. I read this one in one day. This breezy dictation of who he talked to at openings, ate with last month, ran into in front of the Tate, or embarrassed himself with at a social event, reads like a long gossipy email from a friend who is informed but just has too much time on their hands. He is perfectly affable, funny and not condescending, but all the same if you are an art professional looking for content or analysis look elseware. This book could easily be edited into a magazine article that might save us all some time. Borrow this don't buy, unless a rambling bit of old London gossip sounds good, lite and fun. A nice guy to have a pint with probably."
3,Goes nowhere,"Even for an idiot's guide, this is rather sparse. Most of the time is spent on ""rah-rah!"" encouragement, and not enough on the diet or on the glycemic index."
4,glycemic index,"I haven't finished the book, but it arrived in a timely manner and it is making sense of the food and relationships to inflammation and weight."
4,simple and thorough,There are many books out there about glycemic index. This is a very helpful and informative one. It's an easy read which includes about everything one would need to know about this topic. I highly recommend.
3,somewhat easier to understand,"I am really struggling with this low glycemic index idea. I see the value of it but for some reason, it still seems rather difficult to put into practice. This book was the best one I've read on the subject and I would recommend it to someone serious about eating this way. As for me, I don't feel any closer to understanding it, which is odd since I have been on plenty of other diet plans without any misunderstanding. I'm sure it's just me and maybe I'm just not ready to make that change."
3,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Glycemic Index Weight Loss,"This was okay. I've seen better, I've seen worst."
3,Some Suggestions Impossible to Follow,"This book, while it gave some advice that was useful (news about acid foods and cinnamon), overall it was quite complicated - and actually took me off the track I had been on through another, easier to follow method of being on a low glycemic diet. Some advice to reduce stress by moving into more urban areas to avoid traffic confrontations were a bit extreme. It makes better sense that living in a less stressful home life to be a better benefit in managing our stress than just the travel time it takes to get back and forth to work. Found much information of little use - and found other books to be much more helpful with an easier path to follow.Living the G.I. (Glycemic Index) Diet"
5,explain it so I can understand.,Well written. Uses language (not jargon) to explain things in a way useful to the average person educated beyond high school.
4,informative,"The weight loss book is quite informative as to how & why this way of eating should work. I did find the holiday eating to be a bit restrictive, but to each his own. How many people will bring their own food in a baggie? Overall it is good."
1,Only for the person who knows NOTHING about nutrition!,"I am newish to the Glycemic Index Weight loss idea, so I thought I should start with a book that covers all the basics of the Glycemic Index. This book covers all the basics of everything. There's even a section entitled 'Don't Supersize'. Really. Gosh, I didn't know that supersizing my french fries would cause me to gain weight. There are even recommendations on what you should wear when exercising or stretching. In a 332 pg book supposedly on the Glycemic Index, there are only 5 pgs of Glycemic Index values (in large type). In addition, this book also contains a lot of poorly thought out, pseudo-science. If you have never exercised or considered your health or nutrition, then maybe this is the book for you (just don't believe everything you read in it). If you have exercised before and have given your health a bit of thought, then this is not the book for you."
5,Best Diet I Have Ever Tried,"I heard about this diet from a co-worker. He lost 25 pounds before his wedding last year, so when I decided enough was enough with my weight, I looked for information online. This book is easy reading and very informative. It explains how certain foods effect the insulin levels in your body. The idea is keeping insulin level throughout the day. The diet doesn't really restrict any foods except sugar. This is one of the easiest diets I have ever tried and the GREAT part is, I do not have cravings or hunger pains. So far, I have lost 23 pounds in 6 weeks with moderate exercise 3-4 times a week."
3,Not for Vegetarians,"Like a previous reviewer, I was not impressed with the authors' views about vegetarians using the GI program. I actually felt they wrote with contempt about vegetarians and vegetarian products, even suggesting that soy was somehow harmful (do the Japanese know about this?).The book was reasonably useful with information about the GI system but I will not be purchasing it (I borrowed it from the library) because of their anti-vegetarian sentiments. There are many other books out there about the GI system which would suit me better.One other thing - (this may have been fixed with a second printing) the editing of this book was dreadful. Many of the boxes with helpful hints dropped words at the end."
5,The Complete Idiot`s Guide to Glycemic Index Weight Loss,Any-one wanting to learn about the Glycemic Index this is the book to buy It is great reading and good advice. Easy to understand information
3,Wish the food list was longer.....,"The book is full of information, almost too much to absorb and you can get most of the info on the internet.I wanted a book with specific plans laid out and then a list of food you can substitute for the ones you don't like in the pre-arranged plans. This does not have anything like that.There is a sample menu but it's very brief and the glycemic load is greater than their own guidelines for eating ""low glycemic"".Not sure if I'm keeping this one....."
4,Glue It!,"The uprights are not pre-attached and they just barely fit in the slots. I recommend gluing it. The logs are very durable and a little heavy (a good thing). The logs are more detailed than the flat car actually. The logs don't slide around during the trip, particularly behind a Shay locomotive, so you can rest easy about playing pickup."
5,ACF 40 Log Car with Logs,"I did NOT receive any ""Uprights"" with MY Log Car so I'll have to get some Tooth Picks. Otherwise the product is fine since it's on ""Static Display"" most of the time anyway.UPDATE !!! I found the ""Up-rights"" and installed 8 onto the Log Car (without Glue) by first using a RAZOR BLADE to (CAREFULLY) shave 1 end of each to a point. They went in easy and they're in tight. Now I'll have to change the rating to FIVE STARS !"
5,The Fabulous Forties,This Barbie doll is absolutely stunning! A tribute to women in the forties! Very classy and classic!
3,Fabulous Forties Barbie,"When I first saw the picture of this doll in a magazine, I thought, ""I must have this doll!"" But when I saw her in person in a store, I decided against it. I think that her skin and eyes are to pale with her dark lipstick and didn't want to have to completely make her over (especially at the price). But, in my opinion, all the other features of this doll are flawless."
4,"Good Product, Fair Price",Not much to say on this. Price was very low and battery has (so far) been perfect. Would buy from this seller again.
5,Kipper's the best,"What's not to like about Kipper and his friends? The lovely British accents, the music, the simple drawings, and the childlike sensibility of the characters all appeal to very small children up to their grannies and grandpas. The characters are kind and gently amusing, but the stories are not moralistic or preachy at all. Joy is present without any annoying, intense, manufactured, cloying cute-siness."
5,Kipper will never grow old,"My daughter is 9, but she only had Amazing Discoveries on VHS! She wanted her collection to be complete in the dvd format, so I agreed to buy this. Kipper is the one thing from her baby & toddlerhood that her father & I are still completely supportive of. When she's 18 & ready to leave home, I suspect that each of our homes will carefully hide their Kipper stashes as proof that ""once upon a time, there was a little girl..."""
5,you will be humming the catchy tune too,"If you are in an anti Nickelodeon state of mind, this is the perfect alternative - it's pure British understatement, it has a jazzy spare background music, it's not vulgar and commercial at all.A great value. And all the stories are about helping each other, but not in a smarmy way, rather, in a subtle, indirect way."
5,Enjoyable,I have never found a Kipper DVD or episode that my four year old didn't like.As an adult I would much rather watch Kipper than various other shows.They do have some nice lessons about manners and just generally how totreat others kindly.
5,A word to those who gave low reviews,"All I have seen about this game is great, and the only people who gave low reviews thought it was meant to be a shooter like Halo. To those of you, you really need to try and find a different way around things aside from just shooting everything in sight."
5,UNBELIEVABLE!,"After hearing about all of the hype, I finally gave in and bought the game. Well, I've been playing it non-stop for 5 hours now and I am totally amazed.The graphics and sound make this game the ONLY game you need to play on your Xbox. For those of you who haven't played your Xbox in a while, just get one of these games and you'll soon be hooked all over again."
3,its ok,so this is the first splinter cell to ever come out and it is pretty old.thats really the thing about this game its just not realistic.its pretty long though which is good
5,Holds up well...,This game's graphics look good still today. Played it on 360 backwards compatible system and other than not being widescreen the game looked good and played fantastic. Do yourself a favor and play this game.
4,Awesome game but read below,"This game is beautiful graphically but you are in Night vision mode so much you don't enjoy it. The game plays very much like James bond/Mission impossible I used to have for N64, just better graphics. The controls take a little time to get used to, shooting is very hard and slow when moving the gun. There is a lot of hiding bodies. The entire game is based on stealth, so you must be a patient person. Ther is no fast moving shooting etc. It is very slow, sneaky and cautious. Overall it is a great game, but it is slow going."
5,Splinter cell,This game is great if you're a person who likes stealth. It is very realistic and even if you make a sound you'd better hide!
4,Patience....,"First of all, I like to start off saying this game takes EXTREME level of patience. The game play is very very realistic, the shadows and lighting is probably the best. The actions such as crouching, jumping, leaning back against wall, sneaking up on someone are all very realistic spy moves. The gadgets like night lights and heat sensative goggles all show that developer spend time on it. Story line is that you are a spy going around all these European countries and you have to sneak around and make sure no 1 hears or sees you not even your shadows. That gets me irritated sometimes, and also you do not get that much ammo. I am not really into stealth and looking for stuff kind of games, but I have to give this game its props for great game play, nice sound and visual. There isnt any big flaws in this games in that case any flaws. Except it is very very time consuming.Graphics: 9.5Game Play: 9.5Story: 8Replay Value: 7Overall: 8.5"
4,very very very very good but (nothing big)......,"... i just got it today 4/29/03 and it is great from the moment you hit the power on you XBOX. the game play is very chalenging so if you ""get mad"" at your XBOX easily (like me) then this might not work out but with this game i have a lot of paitence i storngly suggest getting it"
5,Incredible!,"It all boils down to this: If you own an XBox and are over the age of 14, you are cheating yourself raw if you do not own Splinter Cell. This game is the standard against which all other stealth action games will be judged for the next 5 years. Splinter Cell is to stealth what Halo is to first person shooters: Namely the absolute pinnacle of the genre so far. This game is versatile, graphically unbelievable, intense, innovative, and incredibly dynamic. It's not a shoot-em-up, so don't expect that kind of atmosphere - it's all about covert operations where thinking fast and not being seen are the objectives. Of course, there are still plenty of opportunities to shoot when the situation calls for it. Buy it!"
5,A Must-Buy game!,"This game is absolutly amazing. It is a lot more stealthy then the MGS series and the game is more realistic. The graphics show how powerful the Xbox can be. Gameplay is fun, yet tricky. This game has a great lasting appeal as well, even though it is 1 player. It has been confirmed that this will support downloads, such as new levels, via Xbox LIVE and Official Xbox Magazine game disks. This game is a great game, and I suggest you add it to your Must-Buys this holiday season."
5,Best game of the YEAR!!!,"I tryed the demo which is half of mission 1 in the real version. What i really love about it is that I can download content. Like missions (official), foot step markings (non-official), Weapons (non-official), and more. What also cool is what you can do before you make your kill. Like do the splits between two walls, knock them out, question, them, hang off a steel pipe, and more. The weapons are great, but I say we need more. First Halo and now THIS, this is a must have if your a Halo fan!!!"
4,The missing star is for.....,"This is a great game.... The story is immersive, the graphics are so good that it seems like an FMV the whole way through, the sound sets the mood perfectly, the gameplay and controls are tight and intuitive, and the action is awe inspiring.If you've read any of the reviews, you'll know that this game is based entirely on stealth. That is where this game loses the star. It's sooooooo frustrating sometimes!!!!When people say that this game is based on stealth, they are not KIDDING!! The whole focus of this game is based on stealth!!! You must keep your mind on that the whole game!!! THE WHOLE GAME!!!There is nothing more frustrating than going through almost an entire level and right before you complete it, an alarm triggers due to a body you did not hide at the beginning of the level. Stealth.... STEALTH!!!!!!!!!ARGHHHH!!!But all-in-all a great, somewhat frustrating game.."
4,Only on XBOX!,"Is what this game should have been for. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is fun, and the story line is perfect! Thats probably one of the reasons why it wasn't just for the XBOX. I've only played it for XBOX and I must say the graphics are at top notch and gameplay is most excellent! I think it was worth the [money] on the account of I played it for 5 hours straight if not more so. I normally don't play games that long either, it was a fun and addictive game. I'm looking forward for more Tom Clancey games in the future as well as Rainbow 6. If anything I'd get it for XBOX, if you don't have it for XBOX then go with the ps2, and if you don't have it for the ps2 get it for the gamecube, because like I said earlier the graphics are top notch for XBOX."
4,"Really good, but...","Don't get me wrong, this game is way better than MGS 2 in terms of a story. I mean, who wants to play a game where you run around the inside of a robot, not to mention you don't even play as Snake. But this isn't about MGS 2, Splinter Cell is a game in a completely different realm of it's own. I found many things in the game though that would irritate me to the point of nearly dismantling my XBox. In the game Sam can pick up a bottle and throw it to distract enemies. Usually when I would throw this bottle, they wouldn't investigate the crash it makes, but they'd come to the area it was thrown from and I'm cought. This happens plenty of times. My biggest gripe is the fact that Sam Fisher is some big ex-Navy Seal special ops guy, [who is a bad aim]! Let's not forget all of the James Bondlike devices that you'll never use. But, if you don't play this game, your missing out on a great video game experience."
2,too deary and repetetive,"even though alot of people liked this game i, thought it would be good but it turned out to be so repetitive in the types of missions as its a stealth game, you get to do very little shooting and as a first peron shooter fan i was disapointed but i was expecting something along the lines of metal gear solid anyway if your a fan of doing stealth missions without the big espionage you will like this game, otherwise prepare to be disappointed."
4,pretty good so far,"Im not too far in this game but someone finally got a 3D game right is what it looks like. I still miss the days of the old one dimensional game. I mean, with the power that these systems now have, why doesnt someone come up with a killer one-dimensional game ala Rygar? Most of these 3D games have characters that are boxy, move like stick figures and have polygon problems all over the place. This game for the most part, seems to have resolved a lot of that. The best game for the XBOX is still Rallisport Challenge. NOT Halo. Halo is fun but its a mindless shooter. Rallisport has the best graphics ever."
3,"it's fun, but consuming","Splintercell is fun, especialy at first, but later on it gets too involved, and it stops being fun. If you buy the game, be prepared. It is so realistic that I thought that I was always playing the game ( I herd noises from the game,I thought I herd cameras or machine guns). When you get near the end it doesn't seem like a game any more, and starts to feel like a task.But in the end, I would recomend it because of how realistic and adicting it is."
