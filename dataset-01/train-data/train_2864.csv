1,Low quality recordings,"I really like Jim's voice and own several of his albums. This one, unfortunately, is of low quality and not pleasant to listen to. The songs themselves are very forgettable too. Nothing here to show Jim's great talent, probably his very early recordings."
4,"Fun, just like Pogo","This is a great game especially if you're already a fan of Pogo. The game play is very similar to how they are played on Pogo. Keep in mind that the challenge part of the game is way too easy for an adult. Other than that, this has been a great buy and was fantastic for a long trip abroad."
3,It is a Collection of some [...] games for the Nintendo DS,This Game contains 5 Games from pogo.com in a adventure style game. If you enyoy playing these games on your computer then they have become portable. Some of the controls for the games are tied into the stylus and you have to get used to using the stylus instead of a computer mouse.
5,Great Family Game,"This a very good family game for ages 8 and above. Some of the people are rude, but not bad. All different types of personalitys. Our whole family plays, and we go to each other's town. To do that you need to own more than one DS, and game."
5,Awesome game!,"We just received this yesterday and it is a HUGE hit!! I LOVE the games - they are so much fun - and my 5 year old daughter is having a blast with it also! Perfect game for the whole family - could be very addictive, lol."
4,Great POGO games - wish there were more of them,"Five great POGO titles and lots of other extras make this game great fun. I wish there was more games available and a little more internet interaction other than just transferring points to your POGO account. All-in-all, a good purchase."
5,pogo,"This game is exactly as I expected it. It's the best pogo games all in one, and pretty easy to figure out. I love this game!!"
4,Fun game.,"This game is great, especially for any Pogo players online. Has 5 essential games which play pretty well in DS format."
4,Great for what it is,"This set is great for practice sessions with the band, when I don't want to set up my full regular kit. The sound is pretty good if you throw away the live heads that they give you and put pinstripes or hydraulics on the toms and an aquarian superkick II on the kick drum. The mesh heads are quiet with good response. The cymbals sound about as good with the mufflers on as off. Hardware is nice. Got a single chain pedal with mine!"
5,Beginner to Intermediate Good Reference on Linux,"This book is really cool w/lots of Info and nice visual format. It covers pretty much everything from basic Linux to managing Linux operations and security. It also has easy-to-understand-diagrammed explanations which approach is quite unique. If you want something different to understand Linux, try this book."
1,"Technically poor, misleading, poor editing","1) The authors failed to acknowledge the different versions of Windows (Win95/98 & NT) which can have quite different setups.2) There is no such thing as ""Linux has built-in stability and security...""3) Linux is not ""only"" a server OS, we use it on desktop everyday.4) ...just because computers are connected by a LAN does not classifies it as an ""intranet""5) TCP/IP is NOT the most common method to network PCs on a LAN -- Ethernet is.The publisher claims ""guarantee"" on their technical accuracy. If this is the best they can do, I'll be very careful buying another Coriolis's book. The authors failed to understand what an intranet server really does, the book title is misleading.Pros: earn 1 star for pretty pictures, but if you are serious about learning Linux this book ""won't"" give you a good start."
3,ROCK BOTTOM - the greatest bluesman I have ever seen!,ROCK BOTTOM IS SIMPLY THE GREATEST - BUY THIS AND ANY OTHERS OF HIS YOU CAN FIND!
2,doesn't work like liquid one,it was cheap but it does not work like real liquid RJ.get one for $60 amazon... it is worth it
1,Stay away! CD produced from faulty master tape.,"I was very disappointed to hear volume drop-outs in the left channel of the first track, ""For A Few Dollars More"". The 2nd, 3rd and 4th tracks are fine, no drop-outs. The 5th track has the drop-outs. This is a compilation CD. The 1st and 5th tracks come from the same lp called, ""El Hombre"". It appears that the tape from the original El Hombre lp used for this CD is damaged."
3,This book is more like a workbook.,"This book is more like a workbook. It doesn't explain the theories of Music in great details. Therefore, I recommend you use this book to test yourself on whatever you have know/have learned about music."
4,Great Workbook!,"This workbook is jam packed with exercises and tests making it perfect for reinforcing concepts learned in other music theory books. I highly suggest getting another book if you have no music theory background. This book is best suited for practice only, as the author does not spend a lot of time explaining the underlying concepts of music theory.Overall, a very good book for practicing theory!:)"
5,Theory book,"I love this book. I've always had a very hard time learning theory, counting, rhythm, etc. but not anymore. My music teacher introduced this to me and we work on it together. I find it's perfect for me. It takes me step by step and now I'm getting a pretty clear understanding of music all around. Thank you Ms. Feldstein!"
4,music theory for adult beginners,I have used this text for college freshmen in a beginning course for singers for several years. It tells beginning singers what they need to know in order to not be bewildered by a page of music.The students often comment on how well the material is presented.
3,So-so,"I like the spiral binding on this manual. The answers to the ""Review of Lessons"" were helpful. However, four answer pages were reduced to fit on one page making it difficult to distinguish between the accidentals--sharps, flats, and naturals. More practice on chord progressions and inversions would be helpful."
4,A Beautiful Reader's Companion,"I bought this book while I was reading Golden's ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and found it quite helpful in pulling together mental pictures while I was reading the novel. ""Memoirs"" is so rich in detail that having beautiful pictures and historical sidenotes really enhanced my reading experience and helped me get more of a feeling for the environment in which the story takes place. ""Life of a Geisha"" also makes a fantastic coffee table book and conversation piece, with all it's magnificent photos, facts, and poems!"
4,Sperry Top-Sider Santa Cruz,I purchased these for my husband. He raved about the first pair and wanted no other sandals but these as a replacement. He says they are very comfortable and we would purchase these again.
4,Holiday Music-Big Church Style,"Sandi Patty's voice is powerful, clear, and full ranged. If you love big church like productions, this CD is for you."
2,CD,"I bought this for my mom for a Christmas Present. When she opened it, there was glass inside the cd case and the case was scatched on the outside but the CD worked. It looked like I bought it used. Kind of embarrasing"
5,Great way to learn about this new technology...,"This concise, yet complete book is a great way to learn about this new technology, very likely to dominate storage interface to HDDs. It is a great substitute for going through the actual specs, and the authors have a wonderful job of presenting the material to the novice. It is also a wonderful peek into other serial interconnect technologies."
2,5 year old,"I'll start by saying, I did pass this test, but I will also say that I attribute none of that to this book. After reading this book cover to cover, I walked in thinking it would be a cake-walk. In actuality, in terms of content, this book is nothing like the test, but I will say, the format of the sample tests were right on, which is the only reason I gave this 2 stars. This book was also poorly edited, when checking my answers, I would go back to review the ones I missed, and in several cases, the answer key was wrong (especially on the math section). My biggest pet peeve of all, though, was the answer sheets. The questions had answers that went from A to E, but on the answer sheet, only A to D! When an answer was E, I would have to draw a little E and fill in the bubble. Granted, this is not a big deal, but it was very annoying and it proves that this book was edited by a 5 year old, if at all."
4,Good guide,"Good Guide,10 years of military service 4 of police experience, a college degree and this study guide and I still cannot land a Federal Govt Job.....better buy more than this book. If you have any suggestions or secrets to getting a Federal job please contact me! I used this book to brush up on some questions for the ICE Federal test, I passed that portion which this proved to help. They however told me I Failed another section, provided no reasoning or explaination and tossed me from the application process....Good Luck!"
4,LP 402 Icebell,"very nice clear cutting bell tone, brilliant as an effects/ accent cymbal, with a longer than expected sustain. was A little surprised at the rough finish of the underside at first, but it is clearly part of the design. Love it! a much cheaper alternative to a lot of the ""bells"" out there."
2,Wanted so much more,"I am a sucker for sci-fi, hard science, time travel, first contact, cerebral notions, all of it. I also enjoy my fair share of adventure books. That being said I wanted to like this book so bad. The glowing reviews wore me down and I wish I had passed on this one.Grand adventure in space looking for a long lost ship while fraught with danger and enemies on all sides? Not so much, the main character Alex seems to be only a bit player calling the shots while his assistant Chase does all the work. The story moves along crazy fast and any technical or science things are watered down to an extreme level. The twists are all sadly predictable and the entire book seems like primary school introduction to science fiction.Sadly it seems like a washed out Clive Cussler novel and where Cussler knows his stuff and often keeps his tongue firmly planted in cheek, McDevitt seems to be opting for a serious novel."
3,"Just so-so, with some good ideas","This is mostly a mystery novel, about the search for the origins of a mysterious artifact that a burglar acquires. It is believed to be linked to the Seeker, an ancient space vessel that vanished, along with several hundred colonists. The search for clues is mostly long and dull, and most of the characters simply fill a needed role in the story. The discoveries near the book's conclusion are fascinating, for sure. But it was a lot of book to get through for the payoff. Some characters also appeared in Polaris, another very similar book in tone and pace. If you liked it, you'll like this. If that was a bit dull, as it was for me, then this will be the same."
3,Good read.,"I decided I had to read this book after checking out the first paragraph. It is good. It has a mystery, you want to solve the mystery, and it moves along well. I didn't find myself caring too deeply for the characters, but McDevitt is a hell of a writer, and I kept wanting to see what was around the next corner so to speak. I'd say this is worth taking a look at if you like sci fi mysteries. I gave it three stars, because to me, 3 stars means that the book did it's job for me, nothing less and nothing more. It's like a B or a B+."
1,"not worth your time, really","I usually rely on Hugo and Nebula award-winners to help me wade through the mediocre science fiction / fantasy, and get to the good stuff. But I feel let down in this case: This book is actually mystery, and a tepid mystery at that (slow and non-clever). The science fiction trappings ranged from unremarkable to underwhelming ('sorry, our bureacracy deletes reports after 3yrs', 'in an age where messages take as long to travel between systems as people do, you might as well visit in person than send a letter'). I felt I was maybe 20yrs in the future, but certainly not 10000yrs. The *only* bit of world-building I found interesting was the way humans and the alien species regarded each other, and this was an incidental bit of only 2 chapters.I'm not sure why this book won a Nebula; myself, I squarely peg it as part of the mountain of competent-writing-but-uninspired s.f./fantasy. Whether you like action, ideas, characters, or mystery, there are many better choices out there."
2,Poorly written,"For some reason I really disliked this book. His earlier Talent for War was so much better. The characters here seem to act rather stupidly, unnatural and forced, and the endless explication of the female lead watching endless movies and spilling her guts to every joe on the street? WTF, who cares about description of fiction being watched in fiction? Seem like lots of filler. I haven't felt this irritated about a book since reading Brian Herbert's stupifying sequels to his father's masterpiece. I want to finish this book to see why it won the award, but the poor writing is forcing me to skip paragraphs. Not recommended."
4,One of the Best McDevitt Stories I've Seen Yet.,"Part of the problem with McDevitt's previous works is there are too many recurring themes... especially of ""saved at the last second by rope or net"", and ""colliding suns"". Well, while we do get a big dose of ""colliding suns"" - it is done quite well; and the ""saved at the last second by rope or net"" trick is kept small enough to be hardly noticeable.The main ""artifact chasing"" characters Chase Kolpath and Alex Benedict (last seen in POLARIS), are likeable.The story is fast paced and easy to read - this is definately one of McDevitt's best offerings so far... and to think I'd almost given up on him, after seeing so many repetitive stories in recent years."
2,Exploring the Universe one meeting at a time...,"This book is brutally slow. It is also really low on tech, action and adventure... pretty much everything that I read the space opera genre for. The minutiae that this author delves into seriously do not warrant the time or effort of hard sci-fi fans. Recognizing that I am not the target market, if you enjoy the plodding pace of a couple of old gumshoes (Barnaby Jones & Jessica Fletcher) in space... you might like this book that got on my recommendation list from Amazon."
5,Very good SF book!,"This is the first McDevitt book I have read and I really enjoyed it. It met all of the things that I want to read in a science fiction book. The characters were also very well built up. I particularly enjoyed the sequence with the Mutes and how the humans and Mutes view each other. I can see why this book won the SF awards, and I will certainly be reading other books in the Benedict series."
4,Best of the Alex Benedict novels,"Seeker is the most original, interesting, and thoughtful of the Alex Benedict novels. Like the others, so long as you don't take it too seriously, you can have some fun reading it.I'm not a big McDevitt fan, but I like the Alex Benedict novels. They're reasonably well crafted. Just think of this book as a little ""roughage"" for your mind."
4,Another solid performance,"This book uses a set of characters established in the book Polaris. If you've not read that book yet, do so. While this book will stand alone, there is character development that occurs in the first that is glossed here.Seeker can best be classified as a Science Fiction Mystery. Set in the far future, the characters seek to find something from the past. Specifically a ship by the name of Seeker. The dialog is good, the puzzle interesting as are the characters.I'm giving this book four stars as there are several minor conflicts that run through the book those and the major conflict all seem a bit forced.All in all a fun easy read."
4,Seeker,"This is the first book I have read by Jack McDevitt, and I look forward to reading more of his creations. This book was good reading entertainment. Not too complicated and a good story line. Believable science underpins his science fiction writing. Very enjoyable."
5,Very Satisfying Mystery in Space,"Very entertaining Mystery in Space. This is the second book I've read by McDevitt, and I think this one is better than Polaris, but I enjoyed both. It's not required to read this series in any kind of order. Light, entertaining, enjoyable, quick read. Will read more from this author. Nominated for this years Nebula award. Recommended."
2,Second Book I've Read by McDevitt - There Will Not Be A Third,"The problem with McDevitt's work is pretty easy to summarize: The quality of his writing simply doesn't hold up to the quality of his ideas. There are occasionally great passages where his imagination shines through, involving evolution, technology, politics, sociology, etc., but these parts are buried between plodding stretches of mundane writing and incredibly sparse plot and character development. Unlike the ideas in his work, there is just no flair or creativity in the language he uses. And in my opinion, these few interesting ideas aren't enough to justify hundreds of pages of tedious high-school level writing. That might sound a little vicious, but sometimes the truth hurts."
2,Missed it's potential....,"The review by Tu was the only one I agreed with. It had some good writing and detail but I'm not sure that was worth 3 stars. The swing down a star I felt was because it had such promise but didn't deliver.It starts out with an interesting premise, but instead of making it more interesting, it's gets drawn out and ends with a whimper.The writing and detail hints at an epic or classic sf story but that too disappears in the somewhat shallow characters and tepid story.It seems like the writing of someone quite capable of writing a great book for the keep and re-read shelf but this just wasn't one I would recommend."
2,not an action novel,"well written. lots of detail. but, if you like action novels, this book focuses on a different kind of detail: interpersonal relationships and the general backdrop of society in 10,000 yrs."
2,The Tony Hillerman of SF,"Yes, like Hillerman, expect grade school level prose, flat and supremely non-evocative, largely ""telling"" the story in a series of talky encounters, very little action. What action there is seems tacked on formula. As for big ideas, there's more in any single chapter of a Stross novel than everything here.Feel free to skip descriptions of prosaic surroundings, there's nothing remotely intriguing to see. Not one plant or animal is accounted for. If you want fabulous descriptions of a human-colonized future, try Pandora's Star.Having said that, I like Hillerman, and this is an amusing afternoon read while having a pint."
5,Great Read,I liked this book. It's interesting and a different twist on sci fy from what I normally read. Think Clive Cussler meets Isac Assimov.
3,Critical acclaim does not necessarily translate,"McDevitt's 'Seeker' is a well-written and interesting book even as it bothered too much with physics and astronomy. Felt like the author was bragging about his breadth of knowledge. Even still, it rang true and I read until the end. Good but not great, IMO."
4,Thoughts on Seeker,I found Seeker to be a gripping story and I couldn't put the book down. Sadly the ending seemed a little rushed though.
4,His evil spirit is back to take over another body,"I think the story is good because, it was suspenceful and I like suspence. It made you keep reading until the book was finished. The book had a little love in it but it kind of ties things all together in the mystery."
4,Devil's Race,"Devil's Race is a great horrer/mystery book by Avi. It's about a 16 year-old boy named John Proud. One day he went to his uncle, Dave's house.It is a very good book. the first part is boring but it gets interesting."
1,Gary Hoyt,"Pros: AttractiveGreat picture.Cons: Hard to hear or understand the dialog on a DVD unless the front speakers are within 6"" of your ears, so you turn up the volume. Then if there are background noises on the DVD like a car door slamming ect. the ""noise"" is excessively loud and annoying time after time. So you turn the volume down to avoid the ""louder"" noise, then can't hear the dialog.You can adjust the L-R on the speakers but the volume cannot be adjusted so the front speakers put out less volume than the rears.With the exception of the sub woofer, the speakers are ""tinny""The remote is poorly designed and has a feature to operate your television also. When used to turn the TV off, it shuts off but then comes back on again after a second or two.If you want to memorize a spot on ""two or more"" discs to return to, its impossible. It will remember ""one"" disc only.How this unit ever got passed on to the buying public is a mystery to me."
1,no back support - get a breast friend,this pillow offers no back support when nursing a baby. i bought a breast friend instead. you can attach that pillow to you and focus on helping your baby nurse instead of supporting your babies entire body. pass up the boppy!
4,a great comic book,"La mort douce (which means the sweet death in english) is not as good as Le marque de Raspoutin but still awesome. Canardo returns to his homevillage and is soon involved in a plot to ticklish to tell (aww not really). I highly recommend it, buy it and the other Canardo books today."
2,Remote Blues,"This reciever is great but the remote is awful. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.The Jump button (used for jumping back and forth between 2 channels) never worked.It often just stops working, remedied by either re-selecting your video mode or turning off and on again the receiverBurns through batteriesHave to hit ""Alt"" before you can input a channel number because for some reason the primary function of the buttons for channel numbers is not for inputing your channel numbers. ""Alt"" doesn't stay on long so a minute later if you want to change channels you have to hit ""Alt"" again (sometimes 2 or 3 times before it's activated).The manual is very poor, as well.I find it really incredible that such a great reciever would ship with such an awful remote that is so bad I'm looking online now for a 3rd party remote to buy so I can use this receiver!Because of only the remote, I would not recommend buying this receiver."
2,The remote is difficult to program,"My main issue so far is programming in other components. I have a combination VCR/DVD. There are no codes provided for this, and Sony provides only the helpful suggestion, just try some other combinations if the few codes we provide don't work. That's nice...but 900 plus codes with a remote that you try to get into program mode and it takes 4 to 5 attempts just to get it to accept a code.....horrible. And Sony support in this matter....nonexistant."
3,This Package Will Never Arrive!,"This is really more of a criticism of Amazon's deplorable customer service than anything to do with this product. I orded the product, they charged my credit card, and then the package for whatever reason was never shipped. Three weeks later they said my address (at which I receive all my mail and UPS shipments) was incorrect and credited my account. I tried to explain to them that the problem was not my address. They offered to let me re-order. Some deal. I would suggest you find a legitimate supplier of this product and have it sent directly. Do not deal through Amazon."
5,LOVE,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK ALOT. IT WAS FUN WITH SOME SEXUAL CONTENT. BUT IT WAS TASTEFULLY WRITTEN. BE SURE TO READ THE FIRST BOOK -"" KIDS IS A FOUR LETTER WORD""."
1,Static problem.,"I'm writing only to confirm, that I have the same problem with CD1. Because of that static, CD1 is not listenable."
2,Bad recording on first disc,"The first disc has a horrible static type sound and is not listenable very long before you want to throw it out. I'm sure it was a great set too. The second disc is fine and I like it alot. I have heard others and they are all the same. I wish the Big Wu would come out with this show again without the hissing,static,nonsense. Love the band though."
2,Technical problems,The first CD is not listenable for an hiss that cover the music.The second is OK. I listened 2 copies from different seller and they have the same problemDanger !
4,Different kind of drama,"Based on the ""Structural drama"" we got a different option to see the incredible notes compiled after several interviews at Laramies' residents who was shock (as the rest of the world) for Matthew Shepards' case. I loved it."
4,This CD is Phat,"The first time I heard Heartless Society I didn't like it. But after listening to it all the was through I think they have got to be one of the top punk groups around. Sounds great, but not enough songs. They need to release a new album before their old CD gets played out."
5,Black Velet by Jennifer Heath,"When I saw this book I had to get this. So I ordered it from Amazom, I was disapointed when the book arrived, I started to open the book and I was fascinated by the use of colours and life in the book, many thanks for this book."
3,Disappointed with content,I was looking forward to hearing the Christian Artists perform the songs they sang during the first half of the performance ... not just the Messiah music.Otherwise it was excellent ... great show!
2,Creepy and confusing,"Jhabvala had a story in The New Yorker in 2008 (""The Teacher"") with many similar themes, arcs, situations, and characters to Three Continents. The former seems a careful, more mature distillation of all the best parts of the latter, and perhaps that is what it was meant to be.Three Continents, published in 1987 (two years after Jhabvala won the Booker for Heat and Dust), is a repetitive and unsatisfying book, and there is something about the way she writes lovemaking that just seems Harlequinny, but Jhabvala's sharp characterizations and shrewdness about the inextricable nature of the political and the personal make Three Continents an arresting, if creepy read.Harriet never redeems herself the way you hope she will (and it is the inherent intelligence of Jhabvala's prose that kept this reader hoping for redemption even as the pages in her fingertips dwindled), and this is a very hard, sadistic thing to justify from an author-reader relationship standpoint."
3,Like watching a car headed towards a cliff,"I enjoyed the book for the writing style, level of detail, and ability to hold my interest. Within a short amount of time, the reader can easily guess what will happen. I kept waiting for some sort of twist, but the protagonists never seem to get that they are being drawn into a web of deceit. I never developed any sympathy towards any of the characters. During the last 30 pages or so, I found myself skimming the pages. I wanted to get it over with. Overall, it's an ok book."
1,Agree with 1 Star,I figured out the 2 protagonists were going off a cliff in about the first 20 pages. The rest of the novel I spent watching the idiots do it despite all the obvious warnings to the contrary. This one didn't work for me.
4,Blue Like Jazz,"""I never liked jazz music because jazz music doesn't resolve.."" - Blue Like Jazz*Blue Like Jazz is unconventional and honest. It is no wonder that Donald Miller's book of non-fiction essays has been garnering so much attention. You may enjoy this film or hate it- personally, I enjoyed it. Miller's mode of life-sharing and storytelling is open and free-form, much like this film (I very much recommend reading the book first). It definitely deserves it's PG-13 rating (this is not a film for little kids), but it's rawness is, I think, what endears it so much to viewers.Book-readers will also enjoy a few tidbits that make more sense when you're familiar with the nonfiction context on which the story is based. The author himself also makes a cameo appearance! See if you can spot him.. :)I give it 4/5 stars.*(the version of quote found in the book)"
4,Thoughful Christian Movie,This movie will break down some stereotypes and get some discussion going in terms of what it means to be a Christian.
4,Really enjoyed this movie,"I loved the book and think they did an excellent job with the movie. You can see Miller's fingerprints all over the movie. Unfortunately ""christian"" movies that are very predictable and rehearsed are becoming commonplace. The message gets run down by cheesy lines, but this one is very different, i liked it alot."
2,Good for a movie but for a book adaption far off,"Here is my reaction to Blue Like Jazz: it was good for a movie with suggestions from the book. I did a presentation on this book a year ago and loved the book, but sadly the movie does not capture the book at all. Yes it has some imagery and imitations of some scenes from the book but it is no where close to the text. Decent for a movie but it could have been done SOOOOO much better. As for an adaption from a book, its what fans see as a sad comparison.If you love books like I do and value the text in light of a film adaption then you might agree. I liked it for a movie but if I was going based on the book it had some mentions from the book but it was not an accurate portrayal"
2,Heavy-handed attempt at evangelical entertainment,"Read Ephesians 6:10-17 --or don't-- and save four bucks (as well as 100 minutes of your life). The line that `life is like jazz, it never resolves' is a frail attempt at being hip and a solid effort at being wrong. At least as far as jazz is concerned. I took the greatest offense at dragging John Coltrane into this mess in a horribly misguided attempt at validating the ""life is like"" trope. And of all albums-- his ""A Love Supreme"" which is all about resolution. In fact one of the piece's movements is called ""Resolution"" just in case you don't get it. A fine movie to lend creedence to your non-denominational Christ worship--not so much for your appreciation of jazz."
3,Blue Like Jazz with an okay plot,"This film has a plot loosely based on the book of the same title. The book is a man's less cohesive musings on life as a ""new kind of Christian"" in Portland. The film adds a plot line that isn't in the book, although includes some similar names, places, musings... I would recommend this film to anyone who has read the book. I did appreciate that the film does not end with everyone's conversion!Portland is where the young go to retire, according to Portlandia. This book/film shows Portland as the place for the young disillusioned Christian to go to make sense of their faith in our times."
2,Not as Expected,"I was very excited to see the movie adaptation of this book. The book it was based off of was a great read that depicted one man's testimony of his growing relationship with God. This Dvd was nothing like the book's story. The directors/producers completely changed the storyline and characters. The majority of the movie was not from the book and portrayed a negative view of Christianity with some political influence as well, which was not necessary. I'm very disappointed at this entire portrayal of Donald Miller's book because it was nothing like it. It was only at the very end scene that I caught a glimpse of how the actual book was. I ask that you please read the Blue Like Jazz book before seeing this film."
2,I felt duped!,"Honestly I thought this movie sounded cool when I rented it. I just finished watching it and now I feel duped. It is Christian propaganda. I liked the general premise of the film, but that's about it. I'm not hating on religion...that's fine for you...but I don't want to waste my time & money on it. Next time put a big cross on the DVD to warn people."
1,Really??,"I have always relied on Amazon reviews when deciding on books, movies, etc. that I am unfamiliar with. What a mistake with this movie! I couldn't even watch to the end. I even had to apologize to my friend for making him watch it with me. Boring and silly are the best words for it. Characters are neither appealing or interesting. I felt no connection to any of them. I was drawn to it because of the title, hoping at least for a soundtrack with some good jazz (wrong!) and the fact that it was 'Christian based'. The premise of a Baptist kid questioning his faith is a good one, but it ends there. The required shot taken at the Catholic church was so predictable. The mother? Come on!! I have already wasted more time on this than it deserves. Don't waste yours."
5,A refreshing expression of Christianity,"I'm deeply biased. I'm one of the over 3,000 people who donated to a kickstarter project to make this film happen. I'm a fan of the book and of Donald Miller.But I also expected the movie to be terrible.Most Christian filmmaking is very representative of our decidedly strange subculture. Blue Like Jazz is not. It's obvious that the primary goal here was to make a good film. To that end it is funny, touching, well shot and well paced. There's absolutely an indie aesthetic here, but it's appropriate.This film exceeded my wildest dreams about what a film adaptation of the book could be."
4,Good movie -- treat separate from the book when watching it though,"I am an avid Donald Miller fan and fell in love with Blue Like Jazz the book because of its honesty, humor, and humanity. I was extremely excited for this movie to release on DVD since it didn't play in a theater near me when it released. With this said, I would like to advise anyone else who really likes to book to treat the book separate from the movie.If you know the book, you might be unsure of how exactly the random and short-storyesque stories might fit into a movie plot. However, the movie was still enjoyable and full of characters you grow to love. As with any situation where a book gets turned into a movie, remember the book is better.My boyfriend who has not read the books and is Jewish, LOVED the movie. So, don't think that I'm not saying the movie is bad... I guess I just had high expectations. It's worth owning and definitely makes you think about things."
5,Thought provoking and humorous,I really enjoyed this movie. It took a great look into the lives of the religious and the challenges of maintaining or strengthening a belief in college. It was a great story of a young man's struggle with his own faith as he looked at how others within his church and faith system seemed to abuse and misuse their what they believe. I found it to be a great movie.
2,Not as good as the book,I loved the book but thought the movie was lacking a little. Needed a little more depth. It was pretty slow.
4,Well-done,"A well made movie that helped me better understand existentialism. This ""Christian movie"" was not cheesy or awkward. I would recommend it to my friends."
4,I genuinely liked this movie,"The nice thing about this indie is that it is honest and like a theme of the film it doesn't resolve everything. That's real life. People who are scared by this being a supposed christian movie shouldn't be. It is about finding who you are, it's about honesty in relationships and with ourselves. It's really nice, engaging, humorous, and a nice change from your standard boy/girl story"
3,X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse Super Nintendo Customer Review,"This game proved to be pretty challenging from the beginning. I played it enough to make sure the game worked since it was newly purchased from Amazon. I put enough time into it to discover I couldn't get past the first level. I just obviously need to put more time into it. From what I have discovered so far from the game it is good so far. The graphics are pretty good for the time the game was made. This game reminds me of Street Fighter II as far as the gaming style. If you like a challenge and the old Super Nintindo games like I do, this is a good purchase for someone who likes challenging games.X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse"
3,Good game in the Xmen franchise,"Thats pretty much the best way 2 describe it. This game isn't horrible but its playable. The levels are short, the bosses are faily easy, but the graphics are good for a 16-bit, and the sounds and music is good 2. Though if you want a really good X-men game try X-men 2 clone wars for Sega Genesis. The Graphics are good, the music is amazing! And the gameplay is very good. This game is good, but just not the best in the X-men universe."
4,"June Christy ""Spotlight On""","'Great ""mix"" of this ""WREN's"" work ! June will never leave ya' wanting for a ""COOL"" ballad !"
3,Good Shoe,"I bought this shoe (in black) along with 1 Naturalizer and 1 Clarks. Both this and the clarks sandal are very comfortable. They don't hurt by the end of the day. One thing though, is that the strap for this shoe is kind of thin making my feet look bigger!! =) The shoe was also kind of narrow. (I have wide feet). With time however, the shoe should loosen up a little. I've been wearing it around the house to break it in."
5,the best of both worlds,"I like strategy games and stuff about World War II so this game is the best of both worlds. The game play is extremely well done and you can really appreciate how much work was put into it. Why? Because the game is so good. The game takes Operation Market-Garden and lets you be the one controlling the shots, for your side of course, although you can be either the Germans or the Allies, which includes the US, Britain, and Poland. You do have field command but you have to remember the soldiers act like humans who can lose morale and flee or they can go berserk and go all out! One of the best parts of the game is that you have such a wide range of weaponry. This is from flamethrowers to tanks and all kinds of other weapons. A Bridge Too Far is extremely fun and highly addictive. It is a great strategy game and probably the best World War II strategy game. Pick it up and enjoy!"
5,a good wolverine collection,"I found this to be a good Wolverine story. Good art. A lot of fun to read. That is until #186, which is the Punisher story that just seems to be tacked on for no real good reason (oh there is a slight connection--feeble though). And it is drawn like some (bad) Saturday morning cartoon. It's the only weakness in an otherwise good book."
3,Amazed or confused?,"A caveat... I am a very compulsive consumer, often without the patience for research.This 2 disc package is a disappointment. Its title refers to the last song on disc 2, an homage to Charllie Parker. As there was no descriptors on this posting I assumed the album was Bruce alone. On i-tunes, it's listed as ""Jack Bruce and Friends"". The only info listed are the song list and ""Live November 20, 1980 Denver"". and that, 3 times!: on the back and twice on the insert. The production quality is mediocre, even for 1980 live recording standards.Having said that the performance is great. Even the Cream songs sound fresh. As with other live performances (grab his DVD's, you won't be disappointed), he gathers around him talented and challenging musicians capable of keeping up with him.For those unfamiliar with his post Cream work, he continues to grow and develop in his composition, his singing and his playing. He didn't stop with Cream."
2,Not what I hoped,"Although these may be fine for baking (haven't tried them this way yet), they tasted terrible when cooked by themselves as scrambled eggs. They tasted like the smell of rotten eggs--I will hope they work out better for baking since I have four bags to get through."
1,Quantity,Description says it comes in 9 pack which was my reason for buying. Only came in 5 pack. If it only comes in 5 pack we should know before buying.
1,Super cute; terrible quality,"I had my eye on this little beauty for years. Literally, years. Once I fall in love with a product, I'm hooked--and I loved everything about this bag: the looks, the contrast stitching, the side pocket, and the cute two pockets in front I thought may be the perfect home for chap stick and whatnot. However, in all of those years, I could never justify the purchase price to myself, thinking, ""I carry big purses--and a lot of them. No reason to spend the better half of a hundred on this. Then my bf got it for my for Christmas from Amazon. I was ecstatic...until I pulled it out of the box only to discover a hole where the strap connected to the bag itself. No biggie, Amazon has a great return policy. Must've just been a freak mistake bag. I got the second one, and within a week, that same hole began developing in the exact same place. Now it's huge and goes right through one side of the bag. My suggestion? Save yourself the time and tears and look for another option."
4,Sloooow shipping,"Product was fine, shipping for 4 batteries rather high, especially since it took about 2 weeks to get them. If you need items from this company fast, better look elsewhere."
5,A wonderful addition to ANY voice practice!,"As a singer, voice teacher and Feldenkrais Teacher, myself, this book has been indispensable. The beauty of the book is that the lessons are short, clear, accessible and touch on all of the movement basics that support free, easy and powerful singing without trying to ""teach singing."" These lessons will enhance ANY singing practice, technique or approach!Enjoy!Robert Sussuma"
4,Don't buy this set just for the poster!,"I love the Olivia books, so when an opportunity such as a box set with poster became available, I jumped for joy! My set arrived today and I ripped it open to see the ""limited edition poster"" that was promised. What I found was an 8x11 glossy page with four small Olivia's in a variety of poses. Suitable for framing- yes. But calling it poster is a bit of an over-statement. Mr. Falconer, you and your publisher could have done better...Buyers beware: get the books for your home collection, but don't hope for much of a poster."
5,Packed from cover to cover with genealogical research,"This revised, updated edition to genealogical research on the Internet lists websites from around the world and the resources and guides on each which lend to genealogical research. Entries include email and postal addresses, phone contacts for the web site, and lists of archives and other data sources around the world. From special collections and historical society holdings to public and research libraries, Virtual Roots 2.0: A Guide to Genealogy and Local History On The World Wide Web is packed from cover to cover with genealogical research and reference assistance source materials."
1,Just not what I expected,wasn't at all what I was hoping for. Many of the links were outdated. Description needed to written in better terms
3,Good,"The product came in a timely manner and is as it was described,appears durable and is very informative comes in handy, really good product."
2,great book poor packaging shame on you seller!,"So this book is really cool if you love darth maul it tells a back story that takes place before the phantom menace. This book was sent to me pretty fast, but when I got it the packaging was ripped open, the pages were a little warped and the whole cover came of because the glue on the spine like wore off or something. I highly recommend this book just if you decide to get it, get it from someone else."
3,Darth Maul: A Sith Birth,"I first read Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter book and I was captivated at the fast-motion thrilling novel I was reading. It was intense and take you in the plot that helps you understand the Jedi Fallen and Why the Sith succeded, but for me Darth Maul was a fascinating character of the Star Wars universe whose origins were unknown and I was eager to understand the complexity and origins of this character, so I Bought Darth Maul paperback to have the full perspective of him.If Darth Maul Paperback lacks of course of the never-ending action of Shadow Hunter, it's a must read comic-style novel to any star wars fan interested in understand the whereabouts of that devious increible smart and complex mind of Darth Maul, aside of an incredible art work which make an enjoyable reading for everybody."
5,"Short, Sweet, but Profound","Beautifully written for ease of reading (easier words, short sentences, concise points). Gorgeous messages of God's love for all children and simple ways in which children can live good lives. Pictures are full pages, very colorful, and evoke children of all cultures and races. A great bedtime book, and an absolute keepsake - worth every penny."
2,Buy the Metra version instead....,Buy the Metra verison instead. It's a lot better built and it's all one piece. This one the top and bottom are actually two pieces.
5,perfect fit,"This dash kit went into a 2005 nissan pathfinder, and fit very well. All necessary hardware came with the product; due to the simplicity of this item there was no assembly necessary, except intalling it into the vehicle. Great buy!"
3,"Not bad, but not as good as his others.","The Wine of Violence wasn't a bad book. It's better than most out there. But James Morrow is one of the best authors writing today, and this isn't his best work. In my opinion, ""This is the Way the World Ends"" is. The theme of the book is peace vs. freedom, and the setting is utopian Quetzalia, a hidden planet of pacifists. But the ideas aren't just floating out there; as in most of James Morrow's books, the characters are strong. I recommend this book for James Morrow fans only, the rest can skip it."
1,This is an awful book,"I give this book one star only because zero and negative stars are not an option. This is a terrible book. The plot is far-fetched even for bad science-fiction. I gave this book to three friends because I couldn't believe how awful it was; two finished it (one of whom cursed my name), the other used it to prop up a bookcase for several years. That was the most use anyone got out of this book."
1,One of the most abysmal books I've ever read,The plot is ludicrous. The characters are completely flat. The science and nature described in the book are so incredibly bad as to be absurd. The only thing that kept this book from being a complete waste of paper is that it serves as an object lesson for how not to write.
1,Don't waste your money. Riddled with errors.,"After this abomination, I may never buy another strategy guide again. I was expecting some real insight from this book, but it didn't teach me anything in regards to how to play this game better. The only thing of any value is the listing of the races which tell you what new items you will unlock and when. Unfortunately, even this isn't as good as it could be, as it is flat out wrong in many cases. I don't know what to trust anymore. And lastly, early on, when listing the game options, they mention how you can turn ""Car Damage"" on and off. But this feature isn't in the game! My feeling is that they rushed to put this book out and used a VERY early version of the game. When the final version of the game was released, rather than updating their strategy guide, they just left it as is. Very unprofessional in my opinion, and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth for ALL strategy guides that will come after it. A total waste of money."
1,"Joe doesn't need Jimmy, Jimmy needs Joe.","Joe Lopez' new CD came out yesterday and it is off da hook. This CD, on the other hand...let's just say that Jimmy without Joe is like Chong without Cheech. That last reviewer from Patas Saladas (or wherever he said he's from) is really out of touch. We already have acts like Bobby Pulido and Limite doing the weak-beat, gay-sounding, lame-lyric undanceable sound. We don't need Jimmy Gonzalez doing the same thing."
2,"Projecting an Empire, but who will pay?","This book provides the basis for those that argue the US must, and should, save the world by promoting US control over strategic assets. But who will pay? The author wants to use military superiority, but lacks the international and national economic background to understand the costs and articulate a rational global policy. His reference to China lacks the necessary global financial perception. In the end, and thankfully, he is only a typical cheerleader for military options and will never be able to formulate a realistic strategy for world order. Buy this book if you want to limit your perceptions to a segment of the military and want to become a similar cheerleader."
3,Author has great 20/20 hindsight,"New Glory is an entertaining read. However, Peters seems to have a grudge against Rumsfeld and his ""Neo-Con"" advisors. This book is perfect for those who love the United States but hate the Bush Administration. Unfortunately for Peters, the people who love the United States usually don't hate the Bush Administration (disagree with, maybe, but hate, no) and those that hate the Administration usually don't love the United States (effusive protestations, not withstanding)."
1,Beware the 4th Reich,"Antagonistic, intolerant, selfish, fearful and above all compassionless.My friends... No goal, no outcome, no end - no matter how glorious, how perfect, how secure it might appear to us - can justify the spilling of another's blood. No matter how much we hate out enemy. No matter how much we despise them. No matter how much better off we think the world would be if they would just die. For that is the philosophy of Adolph Hitler. And it is the philosophy of Osama bin Laden. We must not allow it to be ours as well.True leaders are defined by how they serve. Bullies are defined by how they lead. And peace is never found in the barrel of a gun. Please think about it. And save your money. There are much better books available."
5,Amazing book!,"Every time I read a book by this author I am continually amazed, and this one doesn't disappoint. This book has excellent summaries and well-thought out positions on many military subjects facing the United States today. Peters doesn't blame the US military for our ongoing global problems like most lefty ""military people"" in the news today, but he does reveal deep-seated problems within the US armed forces which can and should be dealt with. My deepest wish is for this retired Colonel to become head of the US military for a few years; just so he can fix many of the problems he sees at the Pentagon and beyond. EXCELLENT BOOK! GET ONE TODAY!!!"
5,Educational and entertaining,"For those asleep at the switch on defense issues, this will wake you up with a slap in the face and a splash of ice-water. Aside from the polemics, there are some unforgetable one- liners: ""If you think you need a nail file (to suppress an enemy), bring a chain saw."" Or ""When those who never served themselves propose theories for fighting our nation's wars, we have virgins writing sex manuals."" I take exception, however, to his including Steve Cambone in his collection of bad guys beyond redemption. I believe Cambone is more humble and eager to learn than many on the E-Ring. I know there aren't many outside the inner circle who feel this way, but I sense he reaches out more than some of the Defense Secretary's advisors. I hope my saying this doesn't destroy his reputation...or mine."
4,bueno,super para el precio y muy buen rpoductotengo un mes de uso ya y hasta ahora me ha trabajado muy bien.
3,Way too large,"Amazon sent this item to me in a extra large size, which is not what I ordered. On top of that they charged me for return shipping. The watch would have comfortably fit around my ankle. Beware if you are considering purchasing this item."
1,Sandwich maker,It broke the first day i closed it to use it make my sandwich. Product needs to be made with stronger material.
4,Hamlet was full of excitment,"Hamlet was an excellent book. I especially liked how the story began. The ghost or ""old Hamlet"" was a character that picked me up off my feet, and made me read and follow the book from front to back. As the play story went on it only got better. Hamlet became a inspiration to me, as he fooled Claudius into watching the play ""mousetrap"" and admitting guilt. I especially liked how there was always somebody in trouble. It made the play flow, and the reader want to follow it. Claudius was always in Hamlet's eyes, and Hamlet was always in Claudius eyes. This book flowed all the way until the very end when everyone was murdered. That is why I enjoyed the play or book Hamlet."
2,Impossibly Thick,"The plot here is much too thin to successfully sustain a 2-hour film, although it does give the viewer some interesting sociological and anthropological insights into an underclass family of tenement-dwellers in modern day Britain, whose daily lives and culture are filled with profanity, rap music, alcohol and promiscuity. Hope lost and betrayed are the central themes of this film, and they actually do elicit some sympathetic reaction. Subtitles are needed to decipher the impossibly thick Cockney accents."
5,Unabashedly raw,"This movie is about a young girl, Mia, living in the slums of England with her dysfunctional family. She has a bad habit of getting into trouble and starting fights when a handsome man Connor (Michael Fassbender) finds his way into her mother's life. A tension exists between Connor and Mia but it is unclear at first what kind of tension this is. They strike up an unlikely relationship and Mia finds someone who will tell her she's worth more than the trouble she's so fond of causing. This movie really grabs you from the start, and isn't afraid to thrust the reality of the England slums in your face. Gritty sexuality and dysfunctional relationships abound, this movie is NOT afraid to be raw.It isn't so gritty that it is distasteful though, and I think anyone who's in the mood for an unconventional story will love this film. Nothing is expected and everything seems so realistic in this story. You'll really forget what's going on around you as you get wrapped up in the world of Mia."
4,still unsure,"I am still not sure how I felt about this movie. They are all so damaged, and human, but some of it just threw me I guess. The lead is great, although she does seem to literally wander around for a large majority of the movie. I hope to see her in more roles, though I dont see anything else for her on IMDB. Fassbender was good, as always, always sticks to those somewhat risky roles like this one. I think maybe this once scene towards the end is what really confused me and just seemed a little out of character and just odd in a way. And although I read other people saying that it has its own happy ending, it isnt really. Not sure if they forgot she is 15 or what but the ending is just as somewhat bleak as the rest. I know Im not selling it, but it was an interesting watch, made me squirm in discomfort a bit which I guess shows how invested I got."
3,"ANDREA ARNOLD, OPUS 2","**1/2. FISH TANK earned a lot of awards so I can't refrain myself from thinking that the overall quality of today cinema is rather low. Not that FISH TANK is bad but, hey!, the story is far from being original, the life of the British underclass sinister as usual and the director of photography seems to suffer from Parkinson's disease at times. Nonetheless, the film can be recommended to curious movie lovers."
3,Blahhh,Don`t think there was much point to this movie besides to show how far Hip Hop culture has penetrated European youth. There is a scene of inappropriateness with an underage female but no real story or consequence to it.
1,What is this?,"I suppose if you just looked at the acting, this movie would be worthy of being in the Criterion Collection of films but I don't watch a movie merely for the acting. I watch it for a cohesive story and plot line, which this film sorely lacks. You keep watching because you hope something is going to happen but nothing really does. You're just following around this troubled girl around in her daily (albeit screwed up) English life. I got to the end like, ""That's it?"" No real ending, no real point to the story itself. Not sure what people saw in this movie. If this were a book, I would never have finished it out of frustration."
2,slow moving drama,the acting may be good but why do people want to watch something so depressing? we all know real life can be miserable that is why they started making movies so we would not be so depressed. any way the acting is good but the movie felt slow to me i had to keep doing other things so not to get bored with seeing the main character walk around a lot.
3,Not Quite 5 Star,"The new face looks good in my car, but there is a separate rear support for my stereo that i did not know i needed to order. Otherwise this would be a 5 star review."
5,Not another wasted night,"I remember when this album originally came out (back in the vinyl-only days!), it took the scene over by storm. ""Alcohol"" was blasted from every punk radio show and every punk party for months. This is the record that made Gang Green ""big"", and for good reason.Gang Green always played 1,000 miles an hour, but on this record, they slowed down a bit and added some crunch. After this record, they made ""OU812"", which was pretty good, but then they decided to sober up and lost that Gang Green edge. Although Chris D was always the founding member and leader, the numerous line-up changes took their toll after this record. So this record is Gang Green at it's best... fast, aggressive, drunk, and slightly goofy.The good thing about the CD is the added tracks that didn't come on the first issue vinyl. The ""Voices Carry"" EP is included, as well as some older songs that never made it onto records or was on limited 7""ers.Buy this and fill your head with some of the best punk ever done!"
3,Gang Green is pretty cool...,"but I have to admit that I usually only played ""Alcohol"" and ""Skate to Hell"". If every song was like those it would be a 5 out of 5. The other songs are hard to get through. His voice is hard to take. I was never a skater though so maybe it's good for that."
3,Very Early Dick Van Dyke,"I wasn't sure what to expect. Apparently, Dick Van Dyke was a regular on the Pat Boone show before he got his own show. He was a very talented mime. The bits reminded me of Red Skelton, but more physical. If you would like to see what Dick did before he married Laura, moved to the suburbs, and had Richie, this is for you. Pat Boone hosts the collection and connects the skits. I was never a fan of Pat Boone."
2,A Book For Insomnia,"If you have trouble going to sleep, read this book. It's really dull.This is no biography. It's a compilation of reviews from the author and a bunch of incidents in Eastwood's life that sounds like a copy-and-paste from press releases. As far as the reviews go, Eastwood does not star in bad movies. So, just rent the movies, and don't buy the book. I didn't buy it. I borrowed it from the library.I read his Disney biography and some people say that is garbage. The Disney biography was interesting. This isn't."
2,Bait and Switch Biography,"The author treats the life of Eastwood as an aside ... basically, this is a book of the author's analysis of Eastwood's films, great for film students, but a absolute disappontment for anyone seeking a biography of the star's life. Actually, I found myself feeling cheated by the author luring me in to the book expecting to find out about Eastwood's life ...nortoriously private ... and having to weed through 500 pages of the idiot author's film chatter in order to gather the few tidbits the author gave concerning the subject. Has this guy ever read a biography? He just used Eastwood to pander his cinema reviews. Utter, complete bullshit .... if Eastwood every read this he would be furious."
2,Over the Top Bias,"According to Eastwood's friend, Richard Schickel, Eastwood is an auteur. There is a lot of Eastwood-butt kissing going on in this laughable ""authorized"" biography. That's to be expected but it is too over the top. The strange thing is that Schickel get's his facts screwed up on the films as if he has only seen them once and a long time ago. Was the editor asleep at the wheel? After the bomb of Eastwood's ""Blood Work"", I think that people do not care, anyway."
2,Art Does not Imitate Life,I was very interested in reading a biography of Clint Eastwood and this one was the most popular but I have to agree with the overall poor ratings. The parts about Clint's early life was very interesting and well done but when Schickel describes in detail the plot of each movie I began to lose interest and somewhat upset to know too much about the movies I had not seen yet. Hopefully a better biography will be written in the future.
4,A Fistful of Delights,"It is obvious that Mr. Schickel is a movie critic, a good friend of Mr. Eastwood and an apologist of practically everything the film icon has done that is questionable. The book is a sympathetic portrayal and does a fine job explaining the movie star's rise in the entertainment field. Thankfully, this is not a slimy celebrity biography in the likes of Kitty Kelly's works. Instead, Mr. Schickel spends a great deal of time explaining many of Mr. Eastwood's films and how his choices are related to his growth as an individual. A fascinating subject matter who has endured in an industry that usually makes cannon fodder of most celebrities' having long-term careers. Elements of luck, intelligence and perseverance enabled Mr. Eastwood to remain an entertainment force for over four decades. Well-written and informative. If you've ever had a keen interest in how this man became an American movie icon, you'll probably enjoy the book."
4,Sometimes the cliches are true,"This album has been described as early Husker Du meets REM and that's a perfect description of it. If that's the sort of thing you go for (like me), you'll love it. On the other hand, if you don't, I have absolutely no idea how you'll take this."
5,The band's best work by far,"Before the Lemonheads shuffled lineups and learned the arts of making corporate A & R people happy, these Boston kids (well, they looked young) mixed the angry, teenage punk rock of Hate Your Friends with the strong songwriting and, yes, ""pop sensibilities"" of Lick. However, the band peaked at this 1980s gem (the CD was released in the 1990s) and fell quickly after the departure of Ben Deily. Sadly, they never recovered. I recommend this record, along with Hate Your Friends and Lick, as the essential Lemonheads trio."
3,Well it's there.,"Creator really isn't anything special. Some songs are good, and others are just there. The album is really only going to be worth the money for diehard Lemonhead fans. I suggest listening to Lick, if you are interested in their earlier stuff."
2,After Hate Your Friends this sounds great.,"Again this early work has little of its latter counterpart's quality. My first taste of them was ""Plaster Caster"" and I remember feeling greatly underwhelmed. At this sounds like the a band who deserve an audience larger than just their friends and family. Of course it lacks Evan's unifying vision that he could demonstate later. This copy includes a ruff n ready version of ""Luka"" live - as well as a short Dutch interview where Evan sounds like he has come home to meet your parents - with a bemused interviewer. It also includes ""Mallo Cup"" which would be a welcome part of his later set list."
5,"OK,OK","Yes, it is monaural and yes it isnt digitally clear. But it has monaural analog warmth and it is performed magnificently.One of the best music buys I've made."
3,Best recording-compromised sound,"This is the best recording of the Mikado I have owned, far better than the later 1960's D'oyly Carte London/Decca version. The original stereo sound was London FFSS and sounded wonderful. However, the endings of Act 1 and 2 did have shattering from being recorded to loud and close the microphones. I always thought this was an LP problem, but apparently it's on the original recording. This download is in mono which does nothing to enhance the performance."
5,They really do last longer.,"I've tried many batteries for my digital camera and other devices, and for me these have really lasted a noticably longer time. I like 'em."
5,Lithium photo batteries,"The price on these batteries was very good, shipment was quick and so far I am very pleased with the batteries. They seem strong, so I hope that they will last awhile."
5,Great batteries,I ordered these for my smoke detectors and they do last a very long time compared to regular batteries. These are the only batteries I will buy for my smoke detectors. Great price.
5,Batteries,"These batteries are required in a personal tracking device I use when I ride my motorcycle. They last about 100 hours, which is what they're supposed to last."
4,Advanced Charge,"There are a lot of people that need more of a charge with electronics that only alkaline batteries cannot do, especially today's standard of electronics. Energizer has made that accomplishment with their Ultimate Lithium batteries. They work absolutely well in my hi-tech chargers for my Iphone and Ipod Touch, without the hassle of charging it to my computer all the time. They are simple to use and work great. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they can run, but when I tried them in my instant Energizer Charger, I was convinced that they were excellent at the power they have given me into my player. If you have a smartphone or a camera that needs more than alkaline batteries, I definitely recommend you give these a try from Energizer.Price: BCharging: B+Overall: B 1/2+"
5,Best Battery,"These batteries beat any I've tried and I used to be a Duracell fan. Now, I use only these batteries."
5,Great batteries,"I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent, fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines. They last a long time, retain power even when they're just sitting not being used, and provide excellent power for photo equipment. These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle. I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls, Wii remotes, toys, etc.)."
5,Great batteries for high drain devices,These are the best non-rechargeable batteries for high drain devices such as digital cameras. They last a very long time in those types of electronics. Don't buy these batteries for low drain devices such as remote controls or clocks. Instead just use cheap standard alkaline batteries for those. The price that I bought these Energizer lithium batteries on Amazon.com is the cheapest I've seen and I highly recommend them.
1,"Good brand, but 1/11 order not as pictured","Energizer lithiums are good batteries. However my 1/11 order for four from ""MTA Trading"" was not the sealed four-pack which Amazon pictures, but loose batteries presumably culled from a larger supply. It would inspire more confidence if the packaging was genuine Energizer, or at least the Amazon picture represented the actual items for sale correctly."
5,best ever!,"all i can say is wow! i have an led lenser flashlight rated at about 115 lumens,and normal batteries lasted about a week in it. I tried these and they have been in that flashlight for may 2010 and its now abut to be november and they're still going! these are well worth the price."
5,Great Battery Life,"I bought these batteries for my digital camera, which went through regular batteries at an unbelievable rate. I was amazed atI I how long these batteries lasted--I can actually enjoy taking pictures with my camera now. I won't buy any other type of batteries for this camera again."
2,Ultimate-less AAA,We bought these batteries for a wrist BP cuff. They stopped working within 2 weeks of installation! Regular batteries far out lived these ultimate batteries.
4,Great for cold temperatures,"Gave as a gift with a fridge and freezer alarm, haven't heard any complaints about the batteries. They show to have a long life even in the cold of a deep freeze."
5,Light and energetic,"These lithiun cells are just the thing for electronics when you go into the backcountry. At 1/2 the weight and many times the lifespan of alkaline batteries, these are what I always use for long trips."
5,"""where, oh where did my photo go...""","It all began with a camera. No matter what we tried it seemed to devour batteries. Alkalines, coppertops, bunnies, rechargeables, NiCads, nickle hydrides, nothing was safe.In desperation, we tried the the high priced (about double that of a typical alkaline) Energizer E2's. They are worth every penny. Nothing less will ever again tough our electronics, digital cameras, remote controls, wireless mice, and even flashlights.These batteries seem to last forever, particularly with digital cameras. The basic difference between the E2 lithium battery and alkalines, nicads, etc. is that the power is supplied at a steady voltage until the battery is almost completely drained. Then it drops rapidly instead of slowly dropping from the first use. Therefore, your camera has full power until it's time to replace the battery.Sure, I'm paying twice as much for the battery but it lasts way over twice as long!"
5,Renewed my confidence in a camera,"I purchased a Canon P&S camera and was quite disappointed in the item because it ate the included alkaline batteries. A very helpful poster here suggested I try these lithium batteries and/or the Sanyo Eneloop rechargable batteries. I purchased both. These Energizers are in the camera now and my confidence in the camera has been restored. I have also placed the energizers in a small portable radio I take on many jobs. Both the camera and radio just keep on going. I don't believe I'll ever go back to alkalines, except for a low energy drawing device. There are more important things in life, I know, but these batteries have made a huge difference in the useful run time of these two items that I use quite a lot. A highly recommended little source of energy."
3,NOT Rechargeable,"Perhaps my fault, but I searched 'rechargeable batteries' and these came up. The reviews were great so I bought them. I didn't read the description close enough because they actually are NOT rechargeable. They may still be great batteries, but wasn't what I was trying to buy so only giving it three stars as a result of the search problem."
3,Technuity L92BP2 Battery is only a 2-pack,"I purchased both the Technuity L92BP2 and the Energizer Ultimate L92BP-4 product options. Despite their names, they are both Engergizer Ultimate Lithium AAA batteries. But the Technuity option (L91BP2) is a 2-pack, not a 4-pack as the photo and description indicate. Just be aware of what you are buying!The price on the 4-pack is the best I found anywhere though. Lithium AAA batteries are much harder to find and pricier than Lithium AA batteries."
1,Not as advertised,"Picture shows an 8 pack packaged as a retail blister pack, What I received are 8 loose batteries thrown in a cheap cardboard box. The batteries are marked ""not for retail trade"". I wonder if they are new or used?"
3,Energizer Ultimate,"Received them quickly. They were not in original packaging. I haven't decided yet if they are new or not. I order with the understanding they were new. They are for a digital camera and don't seem to work very long....not any longer than standard rechargable batteries. Is it my camera?...which seemed to work longer when I bought it, then it does now. Or is it the batteries? One may never know since they were not in original packaging. Shipping time frame was acceptable."
4,Perkynella,I was a little worried about using these batteries outside here in the northwest. But they are the best. And they were resonably priced
1,Li batteries are NOT rechargeable,"Amazon lists these batteries under rechargeable AA batteries. They are NOT, repeat NOT rechargeable. I would not have ordered them for the application I purchased (underwater strobe for week's diving) if Amazon had not incorrectly listed them."
5,received package,"THANK YOU SO MUCH, I HAVE JUST RECEIVED MY PACKAGE YESTURDAY. I SEE IT WAS COMMING FROM BROOKLYN NEW YORK I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY IT TOOK SO LONG DUE TO THE WEATHER DISASTER THERE. IT IS IN PERFECT CONDITION AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.THANK YOU SO MUCH ANTHONYPS I WILL DO A LOT MORE ORDERING THROUGH YOU"
1,"NOT as advertised: Batteries delivered marked ""not for retail trade""","I ordered these batteries through Amazon/Best Deal Supply on August 14, 2011 and they were delivered today, August 17.I was extremely disappointed to find that the package did not contain batteries in the standard retail packaging pictured on Amazon, but rather a plastic box with a computer-printed label. The batteries inside are labeled ""not for retail trade,"" which I find incredibly sketchy. At this point, I am hesitant to use them in my camera for fear that they will be defective, and I feel incredibly deceived by Amazon and the seller. Had I known what I would receive, I would have spent the extra money to just buy the batteries locally.I would strongly recommend NOT buying these batteries from this seller.Amazon and the seller have been contacted, but I do not know what to expect as a response in this case."
1,Dead Batteries,"Got the two packages of AA batteries. Opened the first package and ALL four battaries are DEAD!!!! I tried in a digiatl camera, a clock and another device and amazingly,they have no life. Battaries are brand new, they look brand new, so what gives here?"
1,Energizer AAA Lthium Batteries,"I recently opened up the battery case of an expensive Ashcroft Digital Pressure Gauge and found that the Energizer AAA Lithium Battreies had leaked inside of the unit. Sent the unit back to Energizer at my cost and after 5 weeks they analyzed it and claim that the damage was a result of a Alkaline Battery that was in the unit at some time. The unit has had these batteries in them since day one and further more they did not and will not return the defective batteris to me ...........only a sorry fellow letter. So if there was nothing wrong with the batteries, why didn't I get them back. No evidence..........no recourse. The end of one of the batteries was rotten. I would be very careful putting Energizer AAA Lithium Batteries in any device of value. Regards"
3,"Does not come as pictured, batteries are loose in a box",I thought the batteries would come as pictured like batteries you buy at a store but instead they come loose in a small box. How do I know these are new batteries and not re-charged used batteries? I wished they would have had a picture of the way they come and not the fake picture that is posted. Batteries work fine for now.
2,Supossed to work outdors,They are low on power. I mesured them and they are under 1 volt.I am NOT satisfied with these bateries.
2,Overpriced and short lived,"Bought these batteries because they supposedly last 9 times longer than alkaline ones, from what I've seen, they are NO better and cost a lot more! Going back to alkaline generics and at least, I'll get more of them for my money.."
3,Not really living up to it's claims,"I use a Panasonic DMC-LZ3 digital camera that takes 2 lithium batteries. I put two of these in and after about a weeks use, they died. To be fair, I use the camera alot, shutting it on and off frequently. This may have contributed to the short life, but the claim is that they will function up to 8x longer than other batteries. Not really (my panasonic rechargables last about the same, maybe two weeks). Maybe with really infrequent use."
5,Well Worth the $,They do last alot longer in power hungry electronics. I tried them in my Canon SX110IS and they have lasted much longer than alkaline and also make the camera lighter. Also work great in my Garmin eTrex GPS for the same reasons. Overall they are well worth the extra cash especially if you consider how many more alkaline batteries you would go through.
5,New longer lasting batteries,"Delivery time on the batteries was above average. As for the length of the life of the batteries, I have no comment at this time, as I'm using them for my cordless microphone, in which, I don't use that often."
2,note: these are NOT rechargeable AND they do not last long,"i was uneducated in lithium batteries. i thought they were rechargeable. but have come to get info from energizer via their telephone rep..that only lithium ion batteries are rechargeable...that lithium batteries as these are NOT.to me then, the price value is just not there. for the price paid for these i can buy around 36 good alkaline cells.update: i have found these batteries to not last as long as regular alkaline batteries....e.g. i get about 6 months use on a clock from an alkaline but only two months on these lithiums....obviously then i will stick with alkaline over these....i have tho moved to using rechargeable cells for nearly everything anymore- usually the enelop from sanyo- these are very good and certainly cost effective..."
2,My order where cancel,Cancel my order but was fast to ship my money back. I still need that product. I need an other place to buy those item
1,Good product but.....,It came postage with due. You would think they could get the postage right on such a small item. The batteries are a good product.
1,False and misleading advertising not stating they none rechargeable,"I buy a lot of electronic devices, tools etc.. and the word lithium is usually an indication that it's rechargeable. These batteries are not rechargeable and this is not on the package. This is a Total scam. I'm actually shocked that one could make a lithium battery and not make it rechargeable. I could not imagine buying a lithium battery for my phone and only get one use out of the battery. IMHO these Energizer advanced lithium batteries are a total rip off. They did not last and burned me when I had an interview to do on my mp3 recorder and thought I had a fully charged set of batteries and they were dead. How many others have been scammed by their deceptively ""clever"" marketing. Now I know there is lithium - ion and Lithium but it is to late I have been scammed. If I ever see that little bunny and his drum in a dark ally that will be it the bunny will be stew."
3,Not thrilled with battery life,"I used these batteries in a digital camera and I was disappointed with the battery life. I haven't used this camera before, so this review might be premature."
1,"Sent ""Regular"" Lithium From Loose Stock - Will Not Refund Or Replace Product","Important!! See notes in photo above.1) Shipment not what was pictured! It was not a retail supply but sent in cheap plastic tray. Tray failed and spewed batteries all inside packaging envelop.2) Shipment contained incorrect product. Contained regular lithium batteries, not the ""Ultimate"" Lithium which was advertised and subsequently purchased as a result. False advertising!!3) Some batteries were drained and appeared ""used"" upon testing. All over 50% drained compared to new batteries purchased at a local grocery store.No refund after repeated requests: Requested refund and they closed my request telling Amazon the issue was resolved. I have a photo of what was shipped that I will place in the product image section.Please do yourself a favor and do not do business with these people or else risk ending up like me. I trust my grievance will be resolved with the Amazon A-to-Z Guarantee Program which I just filed."
3,More Power to You,"I've gone through a couple packs of these in my GPS unit. They don't hold nearly as long as it seems they should considering the higher price compared to alkaline. Rechargeable NIMH batteries are much more enviro-friendly, cost-effective and hold up in the long run far better than these lithiums and alkalines that you just have to throw away."
3,Not Retail Packaging,"The ad shows retail packaging yet on delivery I received 8 batteries loosely packed in a box. I guess this is what they mean by ""8-Pack"". Nowhere does the ad or seller refer to these being sold in bulk rather than properly dated retail type packaging. Other than that, I suspect the batteries will be as good as their reputation."
5,The bunny keeps banging on that drum...,I've used these batteries in my portable Panasonic CD player. Regular alkaline batteries usually last a couple of weeks (I use my player at least an hour every day). These batteries stayed at full power for 2 months. They are well worth the higher price.
2,Energizer AA Lithium Battery 8 pack,"I did not like the fact that I receive a small cardboard boxwith the eight batteries , but it seems that they were hand pack or repack from a larger pack simply cosed with a sort of like a mail label. I was expecting a bubble pack sealed from the factory. Was not happy but kept it because I could not afford the time for return it wait for a new shipment."
3,Ok but not great,Here is the deal I have used these type of batteries for a while just buying them locally. These do not come in OEM packaging they come in some kind of plastic bulk packaging. I have a Pentax K-X DSLR that requires AA batteries and these are what I have always used. This time though I had bought the batteries as a backup set just in case what I had in went flat while I was on a trip for memorial weekend. Within two hours and about 200 pictures later I was already getting a low battery warning from the camera. When I get the batteries locally I can get about 600-1000 out of a new set. I don't know what the difference is with these batteries vs the ones I got where I live but these seem about 1/4 discharged or something. Otherwise I received them quickly and in good physical condition.
5,The only batteries I will use for digital photography,"How Duracell is staying in business without making lithium ion batteries is beyond me. These Energizer batteries are superior on so many levels. They are lighter, do not leak toxic oil, and last 9x longer. I used Duracell alkaline batteries last week because I had no lithium ions available. I was immediately reminded why I no longer use them. After an hour and a half of photography, they were dead...dead! I was thrilled when my Energizer lithium ion batteries arrived a couple of days later and I could resume photography without having to monitor the time for fear of battery collapse. These batteries will last for months with regular use and years with casual use. I'm a fan!"
1,Ultimate? Not even close.,"I bought these batteries specifically to use in my wireless mouse, since my mouse drains two batteries in a week. Being that these batteries cost over $5.00 and I only got 4 of them, I figured they would last a long time. Wrong. 13 days later, they were just as dead as the ones I had been buying.Sure, they lasted 6 days longer, but I've been getting 8 packs of Sunbeam batteries from the Dollar Tree for $1.00 a pack. That means I could have gotten enough Sunbeam batteries to last for 5 months with the same amount of money that it took to buy less than a month's worth of Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries.I'll stick to the cheap batteries from now on."
1,DID NOT HOLD UP FOR ME,I put these batteries in an outdoor weather station that had a small solar cell for daytime running and these batteries did not even last 60 days! Very disappointed in this product. I will not buy these again for any application.
5,batteries,These are really good batteries. Little more expensive than regular ones ( only $1) but worth it. Good for outside transmitters for atomic clocks.
1,Cheap and flimsy,This thing is not worth the paper it is packed in. Will not hold a roll. Roll falls off EVERY time you tear a towel.Metal is so thin that it is hard to use without bending it. What a piece of junk......
1,Don't Waste Your Money,These paper towel holders will only hold paper towels if you do not attempt to take one. The metal is so flimsy that it bends when you try to load a roll of towels. An exceptionally poor product.
3,A Cap For the Future,This is not the BEST picture for the club but it will do. Casey the Lion has only been the mascot for the team since it tried to change its name. The Union Pacific Railroad acquired a major portion of the the team & tried a new image. But the Royals are back. Did you know they now may be leaving Omaha? The city is building a brand new stadium downtown. It'll take about 2 years. But Rosenblatt will be gone. The Henry Doorly Zoo already has plans for the space. So the CWS will be here but maybe the Royals will be elsewhere. Oh well. Life goes on.
1,Bad sound quality,"I have taken Swing and Lindy Hop for several years and watched lots of dance instructional and aerobic videos, and this one was pretty bad. I was expecting a lot more from the video, because they are all amazing dancers. The sound and video quality were awful. I could barely hear the instructor and the music selections were not loud enough and did not have enough energy. Instead of starting with a stretch and picking up the tempo, they kept switching between dance/aerobics and stretching on the floor. The video never picked up any momentum. Swing is about energy. This video did not have it. Although, they do teach authentic Swing moves that you can learn and throw in your dancing. Overall, if you want to learn Swing and get a killer workout, take lessons or go to a dance."
4,A BOOK TO READ WITH A OPENED MIND,"Everybody has a right to a cridic, As far as I'm concerned this is a very uplifting book, it's reality and spiritual story, it took alot of courage with god's grace,for a special woman to write this story."
1,Pure Garbage,"This trash is obviously written to glorify the author(?) who knocks her mother, her aunt, her husband, her children. She paints herself as the perfect human being, while everyone around her is merely tolerated by her.The writing and format are not worthy of publication, and I don't believe many will ever know about it. I was one who got robbed, drawn in by the title. I would rate it minus 0 if I could.lan sung"
4,Soon to be republished - hooray!,"A weird, dreamlikle book, almost impossible to describe - makes Gravity's Rainbow look like Biggles, in terms of complexity and non-linearity. It basically deals with the exploits of PaPa LaBas, voodoo detective, and his attempts to find and destroy Louisiana Red - an insidious force that causes anger and pain. But really, as far as literary descriptions go, this is about as comprehensive as ""Finnegan's Wake is about this guy who's having a dream."" The book's more like a kaleidoscope of American (specifically black) culture, leaving nothing out.The quality of the writing can't be denied, and it's so full of brilliant images and ideas that it'll leave your head buzzing."
5,An Inspiring Book of Hope,"I got this book when I personally needed a reminder that no one can steal my rainbow. Its simple, yet powerful message reached into my heart like a shot of love. Now, it makes me smile and opens my heart every time I re-read it. The fact that it's inspired by Barbara Meislin's own true story of loss makes it all the more meaningful to me. The beautiful illustrations support the story, as does Barbara's CD of a soulful song she wrote and sings with the same title and words as the book. I'm also impressed that the profits of this book are donated to benefit children and peace. It works for both children and adults."
5,I had to buy 2 copies as soon as I read it.,This is a simple yet very meaningful book. I bought 2 copies - one for my 8 and 10 year old nieces and the other for a 60 year old friend. Both young and not so young enjoyed it.This book is a great reminder about what is important - and it is a book to be shared and discussed with those that are special to us.The fact that the sale of the book benefits children's charities - is just another great reason to buy it.
4,"Practical, insightful, useful","This book gives some great direction for someone who recognizes racism as pervasive and wrong, and wants meaningful advice. It is difficult to relate to a minority perspective when you are a member of a majority group."
1,Singling out whites to be the cause of all racism in the US,"This book is just plain anti white. Blaming whites for racism in this country, and saying the only way for racism to end is if whites stop being so racist. Are you freaking kidding me?! Singling out one race and blaming and trash talking them IS RACIST! Why does everyone believe racism is a one way street starting with whites and driving right over everyone else?I'm in the middle of refusing to write an essay praising this book. My teacher tells me to not take it personally. Are you kidding me?! I am white, how can I not take it personally?! He won't give me another book to write on even after I told him how much this book offends me. I'm taking the matter to the campus board and if they tell me I have to write on a subject that racially offends me I am going to press charges.So much for racial freedom for all....."
1,Dangerous,"It's books like this that will eventually cause a giant backlash in race relations. People like Kivel are driving a wedge between whites with honest pride in who they are and whites with ridiculous guilt complexes. Whites should be responsible for themselves just like every other race is. Why should it be proposed that whites give up their identity to promote another? Kivel transfers the ""white man's burden"" to the new millenium with PC lingo. Not a good idea."
3,What about black racism?,"I'd like books out there to discuss the dangers of anti-white predjucie. I'd like books out there that show it is just as racist to stereotype whites as it is to stereotype blacks or jews. As for the 'white power' reviewer-he is obviously a racist, a self hating white person. As well, calling Hispanics a 'race' is nonsense. There are hispanics who are white, and there are hispanics who are black. There are Italians who are white, and there are Italians who are black.This typical 'white men are all racist' book reminds me of a quote from the movie, Lean on Me. Morgan Freeman is standing in front of a group of inner city kids, to which he says, ""If you do not suceed in life, I don't want you to blame the white man. I don't want you to blame your parents. I want you to blame yourselves. The responsibility is yours."" That line alone should already mean something for all of us."
5,Makes you observe and think,"As expected from Precept, an excellent study based on Scripture, using the Inductive method that enables the reader to understand and apply what the passages actually say. Focusing on the actions and thoughts of the people in the passages, the study examines the impact of making choices and following after God. I am working through this with another person, using this study in a mentoring process."
4,"WARNING: IF YOU HAVE NOT READ ""ALOSHA"" DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.","WARNING: IF YOU HAVE NOT READ ""ALOSHA"" DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.In ""The Shaktra"", Ali travels into the elemental kingdom looking for her mom. Meanwhile, Steve and Cindy try to gather more information about the Shaktra in a nearby town. Ali makes some new friends and learns more about her identity and powers as the fairy queen.It's a good bridge book between the first part and what I assume will be the final battle in ""The Yanti."" It has it's own plot with enough loose ends to entice one to pick up the next immediately after reading the last page. The juvenile writing style didn't bother me as much in this book as the last. Possibly the writing has gotten better, or possibly the storyline is so intense and suspenseful that one doesn't take much notice of the actual words. Whichever, this was quite a decent book."
5,Amazing fantasy read!,I don't understand how many people simply didn't love this book! It's amazing!! :) My husband even read it and he loved it and we're both adults. This whole series is just amazing. Just like The Last Vampire series it captivates and leaves you wanting to join the fantasy realm. Definitely better than any Harry Potter book by far and to be honest Harry Potter books are just plain boring.
5,Prof. Lott rings the bell again,"John R. Lott brings real facts, logic and common sense to the gun control issue, as distinct from the misrepresentations and hysterical rantings of the left-wingers. All those who believe the founding fathers really did know what they were doing when they authored the Bill of Rights and in particular the Second Amendment therein will find plenty of support in Prof. Lott's books.As the previous reviewer has noted, the first reviewer obviously meant to give this book 5 stars and not 1."
5,Check your facts,"John Lott does an excellent job providing information on the gun debate. For those that feel that his facts are incorrect, do what I did and grab a calculator and follow the statistics. You will find that his research models, results and honest conclusions are FAR more accurate than the opposition. Those who feel that his work is inaccurate are those who cannot follow the math."
3,Article Compilation,"In my opinion, the arguments in this books are very rational and show the pros and cons of gun control. However, I didn't like the structure of the book.The book is not a succession of chapters where each chapter builds on the conclusions from the previous. Rather, it's just a collection of unrelated 2 page-long articles. No data tables. No graphs (I love graphs).I'm still looking for a well structured work on the matter."
4,Secret Girl,"Secret Girl is a beautifully written and poignant story that, once started, is almost imposible to put down. An emotionally harrowing tale - all the more so because so many feelings were never acknoweledged for so very long. I've passed my copy of the book on to family and friends. I am ready to Google Ms. Jacobs to find and read whatever else she has written."
2,A Narcissistic account of a disfunctional family.,"When I picked up the book, I was hoping to read an endearing story about a woman who discovers a relationship with a sister she never knew. Instead, I was drawn into the author's selfish account of her childhood and present experiences.Honestly, the book left me angry at her inability to see other people and her constant excuse making that rattles on and on. Her sister is barely mentioned, we don't really get an idea of what this poor girl went through as the author stops short of the real story behind the secret girl as it of course, would show her family as the cruel, selfish people they truly are.I had the feeling that the author was begging me to feel sorry for her and her struggles with depression and alcoholism. All I could think of was what a crybaby she was and I did feel sorry for her children, who really didn't have a loving mother by their side.A waste of time, don't bother."
4,Assassination of Heydrich,"Very detailed and thorough with a good overview of the events leading to the assassination. Too repetitious of the political motivations of Benes, et al in London. Terminology is confusing for the reader new to this material, but helpful index in the back to all the abbreviations. Overall very interesting read. To those traveling to Prague the church crypt is open to the public for a small fee with small museum and self-guided tour, complete with machine gun bullet holes on outside of church."
2,The Killing of Reinhard Heydrich,"I admit to being a bit disappointed in the author's writing style and the book's format. I am not a writer or journalist, however, found the book to be a bit of a reading challenge as the author barely used paragraph breaks. Rather, paragraphs ran on and on. Moreover, the book focused too heavily on some of the ""way in the weeds"" back and forth over the decision to carry out the assassination of this despicable monster. And, I think in an effort to get the historical facts precisely perfect the book was somewhat antiseptic in the long details about historical dates and Chech political figures. While I haven't seen it, I'm sure the movie on this event would have used more personification of both Heydrich, his social climber wife and the partisans / partisan network. This would also apply to Hitler's brutal actions to avenge Heydrich's death thru purges and whole city destruction. IMHO the author could have done better."
2,forget it,"Mission of Burma was a great and original band who recorded some of the most memorable underground rock in the early 80's. Unfortunately this cd does not bear that out. Aside from the powerfull ""Forget"" and the fantastic ""Progress"" much of this album is forgetable. Stick with the first two releases and add ""Forget"" and ""Progress"" to your compilation tapes.Update: I listened again--and yes it is a rather poor CD with the exception of 2 cuts--alternate versions of ""Progress"" and ""Forget"" they actually are better than the versions on the ""VS"" lp however the rest of this is forgetable and many a great band has released a bad record."
5,Great size for smaller wrist,"Got this for my son who is a teenager. Since the typical men's Ironman watch is almost too large on my wrist, I thought this would be a good size. It fits his wrist very well. Typical Timex Ironman quality which is very good, and takes a lot of abuse."
2,Missed quality review...,"Timex has always been a great everyday watch for me... but not his one. Two weeks and the ""start"" button just fell off. Sent back to Timex along with $8.00 to repair or replace. That was 2++ weeks ago and still no replacement. Will wait another 2 weeks and then start the ""paper work"" to get their attention. Keep your fingers crossed."
1,Died After 4 Months,"Timex used to make watches that ""take a licking and keep on ticking"". I remember John Cameron Swayze strapping one to a boat propellor to demonstrate. Well, they don't anymore. I wore mine on a whitewater rafting trip, and it got a little wet, but certainly not abused. Less than a week later, I finished a run and was going to recall my splits, and the watch was dying. Within a couple of days, the face of the watch looks like it's got a black moon rising.Yes, it was cheap, but this is a shame."
5,my husband loved this watch!,I ordered it for his birthday--he is particular. He has worn it every day since I gave it to him and has commented several times that he likes the size and water resistance. We went sailing in Maine and he never thought a thing about getting it wet.
4,good watch,"This watch is advertised as a women's watch, but is considered a mid sized watch on other sites. It's a great watch that fits a smaller wrist well. I do like the brighter, clearer face on the full size watch better than this green tone, but overall I am satisfied."
2,"same model number, different features","I bought this watch to replace another Timex of the same model#: Ironman model#53161. To my disappointment, it's a different watch: the face is much smaller, and instead of 3 alarms and 3 time zones, there's 1 alarm and either 1 or 2 time zones (I can't remember which).True to Amazon's policies and reputation, I was able to return the watch, and found another that meets my needs: the Timex Women's T5K410 Ironman Traditional 30-Lap Watch.So buyer beware: the same model number doesn't mean the same wathc a few years later."
3,Face was too small for my hand,"This watch taught me how to buy watches online. Luckily it was not expensive. I didnt look at the measurement and as such had to give to a female friend. No discredit to timex this was urely my fault.Aside from it being too small for my hand, it also looks feminine or toddler(ish)."
2,Not as good as older ironman watches,I have this watch and it is great for exercise and general use. I had an old ironman watch for the longest time. I lifeguarded for four summers with it and wore it every time I went swimming. I used it to count laps while I was swimming. After 6 years it finally died and I got this one. I'm disappointed because the first time I wore it in the water it stopped working. Eventually it started working again when it dried out. The seal on it must not be any good. I only give it two stars because it hasn't lived up to the expectations I had for it based on my old ironman watch.
4,Great watch,"I have had this type of watch for about 15 years and this particular model for 4 years. It makes a great every day watch. I have no fear when playing sports. I use its chrono and timer features at work, play, and cooking. It does not need to be constantly removed when water is involved. I would use the alarm, but cannot hear it very well--that's the only drawback and why I rated it a 4 instead of a 5. The battery has always lasted quite awhile. In fact, the battery in my latest watch has not been replaced yet. Perhaps, if the functions are used frequently, it drains the battery.The only feature I would like to see improved is a volume control for the alarm and a way to make different sounds for different alarms. Wouldn't it be great to have a watch alarm that sounds like your car alarm?"
4,Nice Features/Design for the $$,Very similar to many of the Ironman series from Timex. Smaller face. Chrono and Timer functions are easy to use. The water resistance to 100m is great. No worries about most water-related activities. There is also a version of this watch with a longer band that may be better for larger wrists.
3,Interesting,"This book is full of information, I only gave it 3 stars because after reading it you will be watching your child and think everything under the sun is wrong with them, better to just take your concerns to a doctor instead of trying to use this book!"
5,great purchase,"This was sent to my sister in another state, but she told me the book looked like new and arrived in good time. Would buy again. Thank you very much!"
5,An excellent book for the parent of a problem child.,"This book was an eye opener for us. Our daughter had many ADHD type symptoms; angry outbursts, emotional meltdowns, and was fidgety, restless, and unable to stay focused. After following the book's recommended rotational diet, we figured out what foods she reacted to. Avoiding those foods (especially corn) produced dramatic positive results. She is now an alert, attentive, angel of a child. This book is a must for any parent with a problematic child.And contrary to one reader's review, the NIH has conducted double blind studies supporting Dr. Doris Rapp's findings."
4,I wish I'd read this book YEARS ago.,"My son's allergist recommended this book and I read the entire thing in 3 days. My son has been to so many doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. over the years and noone ever suggested he could have food allergies, and that could be causing much of his ADHD/aggression problems. This book explains it all so well, and offers very detailed suggestions for help. Why don't more doctors see this connection? I highly recommend this book for all parents searching for the answers for their hard to control children. It may not be the answer for everyone, but certainly worth looking into."
1,BEWARE!,This is the latest in the Chappo re-treads. If you follow Chappo then you've got all this. If you don't. get the anthology. You wanna know what Chappo thinks of this c.d.? Check his web-site.
5,Life Applications,"I found this book very hopeful. The stories pull you in and you want to know more. They are also very encouraging to anyone facing struggles, not just those diagnosed with cancer. The life applications and spiritual applications were very good also. I would highly recommend Running As Fast As I Can to everyone."
3,expensive and a very heavy case,"i actually got it on an amazon sale for $20 w/free shipping.it's really the same as the regular ones but the case weighs about 15 pounds and the logs are a different color so they dont really match the regular ones. There's even a warning on it that because they are stained the color may rub off... I think that all of the logs from all sets are all wood, but the newer sets have plastic pieces for the roof while this collectors set has a wooden roof."
3,"Not very many logs, Case is extremely heavy","We love these logs, but were very disappointed to find out that the number of logs is really not enough. You can really build just one house, and not a large one. For a toy of 100$ I would expect at least 3 times more logs.The case is so heavy, it hearts my back to carry it from room to room. And this also means, that shipping is very very expensive."
5,Great Tool,"This entire set is worth having. As a Pastor, I routinely turn to the Wycliffe Library. While most of the books in my study are categorized as to type, (commentary, systematic theology, biblical history, dictionary, etc.) the entire series that this book is a part of is huddled together very near my desk; they are a library unto themselves! For lay-person, Pastor, or serious Bible student alike, these are great tools for quick reference or even for use in intense research."
5,beautiful music,Carl Tanner has a beautiful tenor voice. This is a great album for Christmas - or any time. Please enjoy it!
5,AWESOME,"Carl Tanner is an AWESOME artist, such talent! I have listened to this CD many times, and have given as gift, his delivery of Little Drummer Boy is my favorite, although hearing him sing Oh, Holy Night is just breathtaking. Love, love, love this CD!"
2,Yet another classical singer trying to do cross over - STOP!!!,"If I have to listen to one more tenor/soprano/baritone/mezzo yodel their way through the Christmas oeuvre I think I will scream - oh, wait, they have already done it for me. This guy sounds like Jose Carerras in his later years - right down to the overly present vibrato and somewhat strangled top. As with so many classicaly trained singers who make these recordings there is this major confusion about how to use the breath. So often they end up (as in this case) with a very intense and inappropriate-for-the-music sound. A much better example of a classical cross-over artist is that of Anne-Sophie von Otter - now that is good singing and a lovely voice in the service of the music and its intent."
4,Worth its price!,"This little book is definately worth its little price! Broken up into five info-packed chapters (Diversity in the Universal Catholic Church, The Eastern Catholic Churches, Liturgical Life of the Eastern Catholic Churches, Beauty and the Arts in Eastern Christian Worship, Future Directions, Appendix) for Catholics that are not familiar with their Eastern Rite brothers and sisters. (My only complaint is that the author seems a bit focused on the Byzantine Catholic Church, and tends to neglect the other Eastern Rites consistently....) This book would make a wonderful gift for yourself, or anyone studying the universality of the Catholic Church! Especially recommended for individuals participating in R.C.I.A., Confirmation, or anyone with a leadership role within a particular parish. A definate must for any parish library!"
2,Not the books,"When I saw the commercials for this movie, I was ecstatic. I loved the book series to no end. Unfortunately, what the commercials didn't tell me was that this movie is VERY LOOSELY based on the books. There is none of the legend that made me love the books. And the characters just aren't anywhere near as lovable."
1,Better to read the books,So poorly did the movie portray these excellent books that my daughter and I were unable to even watch the entire movie. I would recomend ignoring the movie and buying the books instead.
1,This movie sucks,I loved the books series but this movie barely follows the story line. Please read the books instead of watching this poorly made book. This movie and sequel deserves 0 stars.
2,Bad,"As much as it looked promising as a family film for the entire family, I was very disappointed in how this film turned out. There was hardly a storyline and the storyline that it did have didn't give the information to the audience on what made the ""evil"" evil. How do we know that the good guys wheren't actually the bad guys casted in good light. It was small things like that that made this film a poor excuse of a Disney film."
5,A great movie!,My kids love this movie! I love that there is nothing innappropriate in it. A fun movie for the entire family!
5,Twiches,"Twitches is a super awesome and cool movie. It is about two girls that discover they have magic. Also,they find out look the same. I like the movie because it has magic in it. Also, it has my second favorite holiday in it. It is Halloween. The characters are named Tia and Tamera. They are my favorite actresses. It takes place in thepresent. My friends would like it because it has magic and they like magic. I thought it was awesome."
2,I have to agree,"I pretty much agree with the former reviewer. I didn't find the photos to be out of focus, but indeed some of them are shot eg. with such bad lighting and bad composition that they can't be made out at all. Others don't even come close to matching their captions, and the inexplicable big black boxes on several pages are just weird. The neverending use of obscure French terms (some of which aren't even in the glossary) comes off as rather pretentious.Why does a book whose cover says ""With Values"" include so many that are valued as simply ""Special""?"
1,Very Problematic,"Unlike the other USB drives that I own, this one is full of problems. It will not transfer files without corruption, even between two computers running XP and using USB 2.0 ports. I tried the same transfer using a different USB drive, and it worked fine. The problem is definitely with this particular drive, and I would not recommend wasting your money."
5,VeRy Handy!,"Well, I only just bought the thing yesterday, so I can't vouch for it's longevity or the plastic top not breaking or cracking....but....it writes super fast, is very portable, comes with the driver for Win98 on cd, comes with a usb cable for destop users and is so tiny - I can't believe how much data I can put on the little thing. It's really nice not to have to load drivers or worry whether someone else's computer has a cd burner or not...The thumb drive is really useful for me when I go traveling and have to work on projects on the road."
1,"not reliable, do not buy it.","I bought one from OD on March 2004, the cap was broken after two month, the drive stopped working on Aug.for cap, it is free to get a new onefor drive, you have to sent it back at your own expense, and get a refurbished one.the cap is poorly designed, very easy to be brokendrive get warm when use it. my kingston never get warm.the important thing, it is not reliable."
3,Key chain part broke off,I had bought the 128 mb model which is the same case as the 256 mb. It worked just fine as a memory device but the key chain part broke off after 3 month. I know that putting anything on a keychain that is carried in a pocket causes extra stress on the keychain dodads. The Memorex USB drive couldn't take it. The plastic part that held the key ring broke. If you don't carry this is your pocket with keys it should be fine. Not sturdy enough
1,3 months & now it won't work! States drive is corrupted.,I've had my memorex jump drive 3 monthsit quit working States it is corrupted when I tried to use it. I wdon't recommend memorex yo any one!
5,A must have Architecture book at a great price.,"This is a large ""coffee table"" size book that covers the Romansque Period to an exhaustable amount. It covers architecture, scuplture, and paintings for the professional and the layperson. This book is a bargain at $39.98. Most books of this size and contents cost over $100.00. This book will make a wonderful gift or an great addition to any library."
2,Prententious Zen -- Australian Style,"One of the most difficult aspects of learning about Zen is finding clear and quality writing. By its very definition, any word put on the page in explanation of these concepts is ""clarity"" and ""truth"" in the eyes of someone. But not me. I thought the ideas were presented in a mushy, overlapping way and left me continually feeling like I just read this paragraph two pages ago. Enough already. Just breathe in, breathe out."
1,I Wish I Could Recommend These Books,"I bought both of Coriolis' Visual Black Books - Internet & Intranet Server. The Internet Server came with a cd that won't install Linux. Coriolis is aware of this problem & kindly sent me a cd that loads RedHat 6.0. Additionaly both of the books have typos and omissions throughout. If you want to learn by discovering where the typos are these books are for you (a l is not the same thing as a 1 to a computer). I believe they were both translated from Japanese. In my opinion they are overdue for a revision by someone who knows Linux. Also, there is no tech support from Coriolis. I spoke to the lady who provides such support and though she is pleasant enough she knows less than nothing about Linux. Rather that waste your money on either of these books (like I did) why not get a book you can learn from like Sybex's Linux Network Servers."
2,"A waste of money, time and effort...","I bought this book thinking that I would get a consies guide to quickly setting up and internet server for my home. However, the CD refused to boot (and would stall during ths install, I had to install off of a spare harddrive) the examples are too short to be useful, Many of the paths are written incorrectly, it is plauged with numerous errors and most of the content of the book can be found in larger Linux administration books for the same price! Needless to say, I was very disappointed indeed."
1,Waste of Time,The CDROM is entirely unloadable either via a boot disk or from itself. The number of mistakes in the book is amazing. It is entirely worthless considering I bought it to help my son learn how to set up an internet server and to use Linux! No more Coriolis Press books for me.
1,Complete waste of time and money,"Unlike Dennis Cartwright, I cannot recommend this book even after receiving the replacement CD. The replacement still will not boot, and using the floppy install I get the message, ""No Red Hat CD-ROM found."" Maybe if you already have Linux installed from some other better-written book you could use this book to learn about DNS, Sendmail, Apache, etc. but I sure wouldn't know. If you are a Linux newbie hoping to stumble your way through to some knowledge, this book will waste your time, money, hair, and fingernails. I would give it zero stars if I could.P.S. Check out the Coriolis web site time. They have links to errata for their books - this is a great idea! Unfortunately, the errata page for this book insists that there are no problems, no errata available, the book is perfect! HA! What a joke! O'Reilly books has nothing to fear from this competitor!"
4,Great service,My wife has been using this product for long and she is quite happy with the results. I always order it in amazon and get it on time. I would like to receive more goodies next time as this is the way my wife learnt about this product.
5,"Now a classic, the 1st large-scale genetic engineering novel",And don't miss the sequels Wizard and Demon
4,Titan,"I read Titan and Wizard in the early 1980's. I have read some of the reviews and the criticisms about Titan's sexual content. It's strange; I remember that the novel was a bit spicy, but what I remember most is wanting to know what happened next. I also remember how disappointed I was when I could not find the sequel, Demon. I have just found it. It has been a few years since I have read the others two books, so I will have to reread them to refresh my memory. I feel that if I am still interested in the ending of the trilogy, the first novel had to be something special."
4,Should probably be read as a trilogy,"_Titan_ is a good novel of its own right, but leave you hanging in a big way. I'd reccomend getting at least _Wizard_ in addition, which takes the characters to the next stange of their journey.I hadn't read any hard sci-fi for a few years when I picked this up recently, and found it absorbing and fascinating. Varley doesn't get too hung up on jargon, and instead focuses on the amazing mechanics of Gaia, and the portrayal of his dynamic characters.A very good read, but not essential."
5,The best of the best!,"I have read the Titan, Wizard, and Demon trilogy over and over and I never tire of them. To read these novels is to visit a world unlike any you have seen before.If you are deciding whether or not to read these books, I envy you. A person only gets to read a triology like this for the first time once in a lifetime."
2,Not worth it,"Varley's short story ""Persistence of Vision"" is one of my absolute favorite stories, so when I saw _Titan_, I thought I would be in for an interesting ride. This story, while moderately hard-SF, does explore themes of relationships (both in terms of sexuality-homo, hetero and incest-and companionship; of first contact of human to alien; and creatures to their God). However, I thought the writing fell flat during what is ultimately a quest and exploration story. The main female character, Cirocco, is sometimes more caricature than character (though I do agree that Ripley bears some resemblance in character). The plot was ultimately the driving force of the book, and many of the sequences felt forced. There is a definite feel that this was written in the 70s and the prevailing conventions and attitudes of the times are reflected and explored here."
5,"I've read this, plus both sequals many times.","Each one is interesting, imaginative, and something I enjoy reading over and over (which I have done). They are books I would suggest to anyone who loves science fiction, fantasy, or good entertainemnt."
2,disappointing early effort from an author better later,"I greatly enjoyed some of Varley's later work, so I decided to back up and try this series. I am relieved I only bought the first book. Its shallow characters and predictable plotline left me unwilling to read very far in it. Worse, to my unpleasant surprise, it has line drawing illustrations clearly aimed at the fantasy life of adolescent males - don't read this in an airport where a child and her outraged mother might catch a glimpse of the illustrations. Sorry I bought it but I give it 2 stars rather than 1 because there is at least some effort at a plot."
1,Too much sex,"Sex is an overriding theme in this book, largely overshadowing all other aspects. By the time I decided to stop reading, I had read about incestuous sex, homosexual sex, adulterous sex, rape, and abortion. The author could not even introduce aliens without giving more detail about their sexual organs (all three of them) than any other characteristic of their body. The non-sexual content of the book was interesting, but there wasn't enough to carry me through the rest."
1,TITANically overrated,"This was the first SF book I read and consequently almost the last. Varley's descriptions are derivative, referring to 20th century popular culture (""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and a car no one remembers) and showing very little imagination. The plot was thoroughly forgettable; the campy references, alas, have not been. (It's been over a decade since I read it.) I had forgotten Varley was the author until I spotted this book on the shelf recently, and I was surprised, since he gets such good reviews. On this one he shouldn't."
4,Everything I expected,"This was one of my fave books in college. My college age son is now reading some of the literature that informed my youth. ""TITAN"" is as good as I remembered it and now it's captured another generation's attention. Oh, yeah, and the book came promptly and in very good condition. thanks!"
5,Start of the best trilogy in science fiction,"I adore the Gaean trilogy. The imagination required to create and furnish a believable and yet wondrous world *without* invoking a load of warp-drive stupidity is itself a feat worth applauding.This story of a world where genetic design of life is the norm, and yet life itself is non-technocratic, is amazing. And, on top of all this, the characters are well rounded and charismatic, as Varley can take his time over the three books to develop them all.Get all thee books; you'll be glad you did!"
3,Entertaining pulp,"These books are nominally sci-fi but really have more of a fantasy flavor, especially the second and third installments in the trilogy. Heroes, gods, monsters, epic quests, nukes, and lots of human-human and human-alien sex. In other words, all the ingredients of a pulp space opera. The series makes good beach reading but parts of it are not for the squeamish, so be warned. The dust jacket of my copy of ""Titan"" compares it with Frank Herbert's Dune books, which is ridiculous, but all in all these novels aren't a complete waste of time."
3,"Not a 1-star book, but definitely not 5-stars","This is one of those science fiction (fantasy?) books where nothing is gained by reading it, but then nothing is lost with the exception of a few hours. Its mildly entertaining with average prose, average dialogue, characterization, etc. It falls way short of much better books such as McDonald's ""The Broken Land"".All of the 5-star ratings really puzzle me. I read this book cover to cover and quite frankly, its not a 5-star book. Right, Mr. Varley? (you can tell us - we respect your work)."
2,pool,I took the pool out of the box and aired it up and it already had a leaks in it and was not able to use it. So it would be nice if I could get a refund or a new pool.
5,"Excllent, but keep in mind...","Keep in mind this is a bit more than a kiddie pool. Filled, it weighs 1,600 lb. And this means is must be installed on a LEVEL surface and don't try using a portable inflator -- you'll be it all day (use a decent AC-powered air pump). Otherwise, it's a great bang for the buck. Contrary to some of the negative reviews here, mine does have a drain plug and I've had no problems with leaks. I think it's great for such a cheap toy."
4,great pool. great price.,"So far, we've enjoyed this pool immensely! I priced these at Target as well & found it was less expensive on Amazon. Haven't had it long, but seems pretty durable & was easy to set up. It's even big enough for mom & dad to take a dip with the kids when we want to. The only bad thing is, as other reviews said, it doesn't have a plug in the floor, so draining it can be a pain. It looked like to get one with a plug, you had to spend a bit more. However, my kids love to take the old water out of the pool to water the gardens, grass, each other, etc, so it's not really an issue for us."
2,Could have been good,"We bought this pool thinking it would be great for the extremely hot summer we have been having. I have a 7 month old and a 25 month old and it is not always easy getting them to a public pool and thought this would be perfect. It started out great. It was easy to pump and fill and it even had a drain plug at the bottom. However, in less then twelve hours the pool had deflated enough that the water was pouring out over the top. Needless to say we returned it. It could have been great had it not had a leak."
2,concerns with pool,"We have used the pool three times and there seems to be a weakness in one of the walls. The pool is not on an incline, however one of the lon5er sides continually collapses. We have followed all of the directions and chan2ed the the location of the pool twice. I am disappointed with the quality of the pool and will be looking for a new one."
4,Pretty good for the price,"Overall I am pleased with this pool. I can tell it will need to be handle with an element of care. Do not place it on rocks or any surface that could puncture the bottom. I would recommend, if you have one, using a tarp in between the ground and pool. We, ironically, do not have one but I made sure the grass was even and there were no sharp objects near the pool.Fits two kids 6+ well. Don't expect too much room if you add more kiddos or adults in there.Get a pump to blow this up!"
4,nice,nice pool. the kids like it more than I do. I mostly need it for sunbathing and it's just right for that.
2,Nice pool but came without air valve covers,"I was excited to get this pool; but when I first opened it, I noticed the air valve covers were missing. So the air doesn't stay in the pool when I inflate it. I thought it would be an easy fix with tape or even a bottle cap; but it ended up being more hastle than I had anticipated. I have a rechargeable Coleman air pump, but it's still a hastle to keep refilling the air when my kids are playing in the pool. Very discouraging. A mere oversight? I don't know. It is now too late to return this pool and I will not be getting this brand of pool again. I'm through with inflatables!"
4,GREAT size!,"My husband and I got this for our family of 4 for next summer. We have a 2 year old who will be 2 1/2 and a 2 month old who will be 7 months or so in the summer - we know all 4 of us can get in it - the kids can splash and we can sit and cool off. We filled it with pit balls for my son's 2nd birthday inside and it was a GREAT ball pit for he and his friends - and even 2 adults sat in it to help the kids out. We'll see how it holds up, but so far we love it!"
4,"Good-sized pool, durable side walls","We were looking for a pool that would last through several visits from my nieces and this pool served it's purpose. The depth and length were just enough for an 8 and 10 yr old and the sides were durable enough to withstand their use. Overall, very satisfied with our purchase. Sidenote, don't try to use a bicycle pump to inflate unless it's electric. We used a leaf blower with a small nozzle and it worked very well."
4,Great for daughter,Great pool very durable....concern does anyone use a floating Chlorine dispenser. It is a pain to keep draining and keeping the debris out. I did buy a pool skimmer works well...I was wondering if a dispenser would be appriopriate for this size pool.thanks
3,Inflatable pool -,"This pool was more expensive than the same pool at Target, and did not have a water emptying valve."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"I should have read the reviews before I purchased this pool. THERE IS NO DRAIN PLUG as advertised. I already have a pool with no drain plug, don't need another. Now I have to go thru the hassle of returning it. I am not a happy Camper.C. Brewer"
1,WARNING! NO DRAIN PLUG!!,"Bought this month's ago for a gift for my son because he wanted a new onefor this summer. What a mistake. It holds gallons and gallons of water, butupon closer inspection, had no drain! I was very disappointed. I had read reviews before but never saw anything about the drain. Since then, several other customers have discovered the same problem. I wish I had waited! What a hassle!"
1,Do Not Buy,"I purchased this for my grandchildren recently, blew it up, began filling it with water and when we went to check it, there was water all over the ground. Granted I only paid $23 for it, but I did NOT get to use it once and am not going to spend the money to send it back. Will NEVER buy another pool from Amazon again !"
5,Great Fun!,The pool was great! My 17 year old granddaughter was able to set this up by herself! It is roomy and much easier to use than the round one we had last year. Its very easy to drain - simply let the air out of the sides and there goes the water. There is a drain in the bottom of the pool also.I would recommend this pool with no hesitation.
4,POOL,"AWESOME POOL. OUR FIRST ONE. OUR SONS, AGE 2 AND 3 AND A HALF LOVE IT. THEY JUMP AROUND IN IT ALL THE TIME DURING THE SUMMER. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY ARE BOYS AND LOVE PUTTING DIRT IN IT. NOT THE POOLS FAULT. THEY HAVE TO PROBLEM GETTING IN OR OUT. IT EASY TO PROP THE POOL NET UNDER IT AND DRAIN WATER OUT DURING THE NIGHT. VERY LIGHTWEIGHT WHICH IS GOOD FOR ME SINCE IM PREGANT AGAIN. VERY COOL POOL. 2ND SUMMER USING IT."
4,good pool.,"Nice size pool for my 3 year old but a small twig ripped a hole in it, my did not come with a patch kit so i had to run to hardware store and pick up $5 kit. I would buy again for the price."
3,Okay for price,"I've used it five times, with no problems. It's cheap and easy to use. Make sure to orient it so that the lowest point is where the water empty valve is located, otherwise it's hard to get water out. Also, you need to use a spoon to keep the valve open when emptying the pool."
2,Fun while it lasted-which wasn't long,"I bought this inflatable pool twice and both times was disappointed. The first time, after inflating and filling it up, I enjoyed it only 2 or 3 times and it deflated on me. Even though I only sat in it, no rough housing, no kids or anything, I gave it the benefit of a doubt and bought it again. After all, it was very inexpensive in comparison and I really enjoyed sitting in it on hot days. 2nd time around, same exact thing. They advertise a patch kit, which neither came with... I would not recommend it, unless you only need it for a one time event."
1,No Drain Plug....Leaks air!,"I bought this pool after the great reviews.I see another person replied that there is no drain plug just a few days ago. They must be sending out a different pool now.It also leaks air. We could see it slowly deflating, after we finished blowing it up. There is water inside the sides of the pool where the air is, so I am assuming that the leak is on the inside of the pool. We can't find it.I am disappointed that we received a product that is NOT the one that he thought we bought. Having it leak immediately, is also very frustrating.Buyer beware...NO Drain Plug!"
4,"Step on the side, people. Deflate a little to make it easier.",What is the obsession with a drain plug? Step on the side to let enough water out so you can then flip the thing over. Letting some air out first will help. Presto -- drained.
1,Help! I'm under water!,"Wow. Ten bucks isn't a bad deal for headphones that come with extra ear tips, right? Wrong. The Jwin earphones sound like the music is underwater no matter how I adjusted the EQ on my iPhone, Nano, and computer. Go for the Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones instead. $5 and a billion times better sound quality! Now, I know you might be thinking that sound quality is too subjective. True. But, as a performing/recording musician for over 15 years and a music listener since birth, you can trust me when I say that the sound is at least better (I think WAY better) with the Coby's then with these. Plus, the Coby's fit better even though they only come with one tip! The Jwin never felt secure with all three tips. Last thing, I do have small ears and the Coby fit perfectly for me...who know how they'd hold up in Shaq sized ears."
3,"Not at all a ""practical"" book!","I would like to point out that the back text is a bit misleading, to say the least. It makes references to engineers, computer scientists and ""a variety of practical examples"", but the book is completely theoretical and not at all suited for someone who actually wants to use shape theory. For those people, ""Statistical shape analysis"" by Dryden and Mardia is much better suited. Once you have read this, you can get some interesting theoretical background from Kendall's book. For mathematicians this is quite likely the right choice."
4,A great book with a pesky fault,"This field guide will enable you to see paintings of all of the birds that occur in the area. It also discusses (briefly) each bird. The paintings are excellent and the copy is quick and to the point. To pick at nits, though, the arrangement of the paintings is confusing. Not all birds in a specific family are illustrated on the same plate, and some are found pages away from the rest of their family. The logic seems to be that if the bird is found regularly in northern North America (the elegant trogon, for example) its picture does not need to run with the rest of its relatives. Close study of the guide can overcome this problem, however, making it an easy, economical way to pack the information of other guides into the field."
2,Substandard in almost every regard,"To be sure, this field guide is better than having no field guide. If birds posed for observation, it would be a great field guide. But for the real world this guide is disorganized in text and illustrations beyond excuse. I'm not sure this is the author's fault. It may be due to the publisher cutting costs. Still, no excuse. A birder will pay a premium for a great field guide. Illustrations are jammed together on each plate with no regard to proportionate size, or to other birds on that plate. For example, kingfishers are intermixed with trogons, motmots, swallows and woodpeckers on 3 separate plates. The amazon kingfisher is on one plate; the similar green kingfisher is 2 plates later. Quick comparison is impossible. Seven trogons are together on one plate, but the elegant trogon is 2 plates later. Some woodpeckers are on each of plates 20, 21 & 22; the imperial woodpecker is on plate 45. First I cried, then I laughed."
2,"Not quite worthless, but almost","I took this guide to Oaxaca to carry in the field, as the Howell guide is so heavy. I almost threw it over the cliff at Monte Alban. It will help you remember which euphonia is which, but for anything more subtly marked it is almost no help at all. Furthermore, there are no range maps, no details on alternate plumages, little to no information on vocalizations. I would have done better to bring the old Peterson guide, even though it is out of date."
3,Better than some,"This book is much better than some out there (the Peterson field guide to Mexican birds to name one) but it is still lacking. The plates are completely disorganized which is frustrating, and there is no mention of bird song. I am happy with my copy, as it has allowed me to identify all the birds in my area (Guanajuato, and even those that are shared with the rest of North America) but it took time and patience to figure out where they where in the book. It is a great starting place for now, and I am hopeful of finding a better guide one day, for easier use, and more complete information."
3,Better than no field guide,"I bought this book to take along on a cruise that stopped in Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala, and found it of value, although somewhat difficult to use. The author's abbreviations are not too difficult to follow, but the separation between the plate drawings and the text was tiresome. Also, three of the plates are in black and white instead of color, making species identification more difficult.Marshall Faintich, author of ""A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Wintergreen"""
4,Very useful,Its a great option for the money! very nice ilustrations. Some problems with the abbreviations but still one of the best birding books i have.
3,Really? Not awful.,"The people who are complaining of the ""graphic sexual"" nature of this book were obviously misled when purchasing/reading. This book is erotica. It is supposed to be erotic. What good would an erotic book be without nudity, sexuality, etc. This book is sold in adult stores...expect a little graphic sexuality. So in that sense, it accomplishes it goal. However, I will agree that the plot line is jumpy, sporadic, and over all the book is not the most well written piece ever. The story line does make the reader want to get to the end, to figure what happens to the character, and it is a pretty short/easy read. It is not great though."
1,This book isn't good at all,"I find myself agreeing with the guy who said ""never read this book."" He's right, there are some disturbing images, depicting sexual nudity and even sado-masochism. To be fair, this is quite a lot worse than what most decent people expect when they sit down with a book.Also, the plot is so drab it's hardly worth the money. Think every B-spy movie and you've got it: happily retired spy gets called back to service, is thrown into confusion by the bad guys, starts working (and sleeping) with a nervous and mysterious co-agent, chases around the continent of Europe, sorta finishes the job, then goes to bed. Cheesy, to say the least."
3,A So-So Story About a Demolition Derby Driver from Long Island,"Speedo is a 2004 documentary about Ed ""Speedo"" Jager - a champion demolition derby driver with a troubled home life. Speedo has attracted excellent reviews, but I thought that the film was mediocre. Jager is somewhat likeable in that he wears his heart on his sleeve and his passion for the demolition derby is contagious. On the other hand, he is also a sore loser who pouts, curses, and gets into fights when he loses. Moreover, the scenes showing Speedo's troubled home life are only mildly interesting and quite depressing.I'm glad that I saw Speedo, but I can't give it a strong recommendation."
1,Read the spec instead,"Numerous typos, wrong diagrams and flow charts, obvious cut & paste errors. The online errata doesn't come close to identifying all of the errors."
5,Great heater!,Use in an addition. Very large room. Looks nice and warms the room quickly and efficiently. Would definitely recommend. Easy to turn off and on.
4,Better than adequate Garage Heater,"Ideal as a garage heater. In spite of some fairly cold, windy weather and, unfortunately, many air leaks resulting from Huricane Sandy, I have not needed to use beyond the lowest setting."
1,New watches are supposed to work.,"I ordered this watch because it had an alarm - not many women's dress watches have this feature. I was very disappointed when we could not get the watch to work. We followed the enclosed directions but just couldn't get it to start. I'm not sure if just the battery was dead or if there is something else wrong with it, but c'mon it's supposed to be a brand new watch!Since this was ordered through Timex, I had to contact Timex's CS dept. to get an RMA # in order to send it back. She wasn't quite sure how to issue a credit since it was ordered thru Amazon and it took her a few minutes to find my order in her system because the invoice # listed on my packing list didn't match Timex's account #'s - however she is sending me a mailer to return the watch & hopefully issue the credit. I am still waiting to receive the mailer..."
5,McDiarmid gets better and better!,"One of the things about Val McDiarmid's work that is so intriguing is her insight into the motivations of the villain. In this novel, the torment refers to the motivations of the hero as well and reveals even more about the formation of empathy in the main characters. McDiarmid can only be considerd to be at the top of her game here. When one would think these recurring characters have no place futher to go, she takes the reader to the next most organic place...their souls."
4,McDermid is always gripping ...,... and this title is no exception. The continution of the Tony and Carol saga. I highly recommend!
1,Do NOT Purchase - Read Comments First,"This is a duplication of what is already in the 2 Double-sided DVD set. There really is no second part. This DVD has chapters 10-17 and the trailers/extras, which you get when you buy the Amor Real 2 Disc DVD set ISBN 1-57829-9999-3 for almost the same price (and you get all 17 chapters of the story with it)."
1,Florida in 60 minutes ( FLAUSA ),"I have seen better produced videos by high school students , simply put this is terrible . There appears to be no script ,too much attention on aligators . Much of the video looks so dated in spite of its claimed recent date , where's info on Tampa/Clearwater/Marco I./Sanibel& Cap/Palm Beach... too much attention on Orlando/Miami . FLAUSA should look at some of the materials produced for the "" I love NY "" campagin ."
4,a good dvd,"as a yoga teacher for 15 years i do plenty of reviews of dvdi have known the jivamukti style and is very much in its integrity of real spiritual yoga for the now generation, sharon takes you through the chakras in poses that coordinate with the chakra then places the meaning, the sound and chant along with that chakra, also i enjoyed alot the fact that she guides you through the mental physical and emotional state of what each chakra represents and therefore allows healing and opening to take place. not a diffucult dvd to do and does not have that many postures to do and is slow going gives you time to sink into the pose and does not instruct you on placements of the pose, so you should know some yoga before doing this so you know where your hands, feet and mind belong. i really liked this alot and will use this for my own personal healing and growth. i also like the other additional sequences you can add into your practice. get it for sure!"
1,not what I expected,No instruction given and it moves at a fast pace. Might be great for some but I think the description should make it more clear what it is. I don't see how anyone can really follow along with the poses - it moves fast and doesn't describe what to do. And if not an instructional video then it should describe why to do it - so it could be educational on the subject.
2,preachy and boring,"this dvd is extremely basic. the chanting is corny and distracting. I would suggest the series by Anodea Judith, even though it's audio only. Much more substantial.Chakra Balancing"
1,Many dead batteries in the pack,"I used the batteries within a few days of their arrival. The first 2 batteries worked just fine. When I had to replace those, one hearing aid didn't work. I replaced the battery once, then a second time. After three batteries, I decided the hearing aid must have a problem and called my audiologist. These were new new aids. After the call, I decided to try a fourth battery. When that one worked, it was clear that the problem was with the battery pack. All of these batteries were still sealed with the little tab, so the problem either had to be a shelf life that was too long or inadequate storage conditions before selling. I would not buy these batteries again and take a chance on them."
3,Just another Wolverine Story,First off I can't stand Wolverine being a hairy looking animal. The story is alright but its just Wolverine fighting guys with guns. Anybody Marvel character could have done this.
5,The Brotherhood,Collects Wolverine (v3) 1-6 by Greg Rucka & Derek Robertson.Glad to find this still in stock! Now if I can only get my hands on volumes 2&3...
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A sordid tale of a cult taking over a town, and a promise made to a dead girl. After this part, it basically goes :-Wolverine 27Cult 0 (apart from their victims).An interesting conversation at the end between Logan and Kurt, in a mutant run bar.The story starts, when Wolverine, having a loner fest, reading a bunch of classic novels, meets one of his neighbours. She is a woman on the run from a horrible past."
3,Forget this book,"Although Dr. Day is a dermatologist, I must say the information in her book was mundane and certainly not very new information. What was informative was her section on rejuvenation techniques that are presently available. Her focus on attitude, diet, makeup,and style brought nothing new to the table. Her section on hair loss was inadequate. This information should have been a 25 page pamphlet but certainly not a book. I will commend her for not hawking her skin care line too heavily like others have done (does Perricone ring a bell?). Just not very revolutionary."
3,The writing style puts me OFF,"The author, Doris Day MD was on SIRIUS RADIO. Doctor radio. Wanting to learn more of her what she had to say, I bought the book. I've picked it up and put it down a number of times.Style of writing, like an advertisement for some investments, repeats: ""I will tell you about ..........later"" and similar phrases.I doubt Dr. Day is at fault, it must be the co-author.The message is basic and might have been covered in a few pages."
2,Forget The Face Lift,My order came in a few days.When packaged the book was damaged. The lower right corner of the book had quite a few of the pages bent.I did not appreciate this.Thank You.
3,Decent Slippers but not superior quality,"I was a little disappointed when I recieved these slippers by the quality of manufacture. The Cosmetics of them are great, and they have held up, but the soles are pretty thin."
4,"Not as good as 1st part, but good enough","I wasn't as good as a 'Hostage', but it was OK. However I didn't experience the wow effect after reading that one."
4,Quite Realistic and Enchanting,"""I Love You Like Crazy Cakes,"" is such an enchanting tale of an adoptive mother's true love for her baby. As an adopted child myself, I picked the book up at Barnes and was all teary by the end! That is powerful writing. My best friends just adopted a child from Asia, and THEY WILL BE RECEIVING THIS BOOK...ASAP! Through Rose's writing, you will understand the true meaning of adoption and the strong bond adoptive parents feel immediately with their children! I am so thankful for the writings of adopted children and their adoptive parents. It is amazing how much these stories mean to the children who need them. Thank you!"
5,My daughter's favorite book!,"I adopted my daughter from China in 2001 and this has been her favorite book from the beginning. She sees the woman in the book as me and the baby in the book as her. In her mind the book was written for us, about us. It tells the story of her adoption in simple language terms that she can understand. It has always been my favorite too."
5,"Beautiful, and touching","I could not quit crying as I read this beautiful book. My husband and I our waiting for our child to come to us. It expressed the love that adoptive parents feel, that complete love that is overwhelming. This will be the first book I will read to our child."
5,From My Own Experience,"I was browsing in the children's section of the bookstore when this book caught my eye. I picked it up because I thought that the baby on the cover was adorable. The minute I read the first couple of words I knew what this book was about. As I sat there reading this book, I could feel the tears starting to swell in my eyes. I was five years old when I was adopted and I am now 23 years old. I Love You Like Crazy Cakes struck a deep chord with me and hope it does the same for anyone who reads it."
3,Good but not great,"Like most people who purchase this book, I'm an adoptive parent of a baby from China.I thought this book was good, and I'm glad I purchased it, but I was hoping for more. It does tell the typical China adoption story that most of us go through, and it does so in a way that a child can uderstand. So, from a purely education point of view, it does the trick. However, it was not as warm and fuzzy as I was hoping for.I also purchased ""Shaoey and Dot : Bug Meets Bundle"". This is the story of a Chinese girl's adoption through the eyes of a ladybug. I thought this one was 5 stars - so much cuter, even more kid-friendly, and it actually brought tears to my eyes the first time I read it to my daughter."
5,Daughter loves this book!,My 8-yr. old daughter loves this book and I do too! Gives us a great jumping-off point to talk about our own family adoption story!
5,I Love I Love You Like Crazy Cakes,"This book has superb illustrations by Jane Dyer that are timeless and classic. If you or someone you know has adopted a baby from overseas, especially from China, this book speaks to the heart. It is well-written and a keepsake."
5,Great Introduction to My Daughters Adoption Story,"I'm single and my parent's bought me this book the day after I told them I was going to adopt a child from China. My daughter has been with me for nearly 2 years now and I still can't read it without tearing up. My daughter2 1/2 loves this book. She picks it up and says, ""You and me!"" I have always read it to her by changing the story to reflect ours better. Rather than playing in the hotel room, I always talk about going swimming and shopping. And in speaking about our arrival home I mention the names of the family members waiting for us. She was so interested in this book that last week I got out her photo album and talked her through her own adoption story showing her pictures of the ""big room"" she lived in. She loved it. This book has given me the chance to talk about adoption easily with my daugter at a very young age. And SHE LOVES the photos!"
1,Why so sad?,"I feel there is enough sadness associated with adoption already, why would you dwell on it. The final part of the book is that the adoptive mother cried for the birthmother. I think this imposes your own feelings of guilt onto your child and makes the child feel sad or guilty. I threw it in the trash and am opting for books that celebrate adoption and life, not guilt children in order to produce a tearjerker."
3,best for single moms,"This is a very sweet story of a mother and her journey to her daughter in China. I liked it but, my husband hated it because there is absolutely no mention of a father. He disliked it so much that I returned it."
3,Didn't Know This Was About Adopting a Chinese Child,"This book is fine and heart warming but you have to know who the audience is. I was just trying to buy some cheap board books for our six month old daughter. This book looked okay from the cover but I didn't bother to dig deeper.When reading it for the first time, I thought this is nice but isn't really applicable to our family since we have biological children but for someone adopting a child overseas, it is great to know that there is something directed to you."
2,Good for single parents,I was dissappointed in this book -- it only had a mommy and not a daddy.. TOO BAD!!! because the drawings of orphanage are sooo good and accurate. Big dissappointment..I would never have purchased.. But great if you are a single mom who adopted..
4,"Likeable, good for small adoptees...","This book was a good introduction for my children to the idea that they were born elsewhere and were cared for by others when they were new to the world. One of mine used to mimic one illustration where it kind of looks like the baby has her hand/fist up to her mouth. Good story with great airplane illustrations for kids! The story is touching for Moms, but I have always felt that it overlooked Dads and Dads' joy. I can understand why the author did it this way, but perhaps she should insert an encouraging prologue. As we turn the pages and dialogue is prompted to refresh our own story, I include details of Dad carrying my babies, and how each of them was unwilling to let go."
5,Wonderful!,"My daughter is from Russia, but she knows this story by heart. She can tell me exactly what that baby was missing: a Mama! Sara knows that this is her story too, just a slightly different place. This book has meant a lot to everybody who has read it, both adoptive and non-adoptive families. It is perfect for children of single-parent families, especially if they have a child from a foreign country. I especially love the part where the mother speaks of her baby's birth-mother with such love. That is exactly how I feel."
1,What age group is this book for?,"This book looks like a toddler's book, with big cardboard pages. However, the writing is geared towards a 5 or 6 year old, and the illustrations are neither bright nor interesting enough to keep the attention of either age group. Also, the ""crazy cakes"" phrase isn't explained - why not? The kids will ask."
2,silly story,"I didn't like it. Story was silly and stupid. It writes like a first grader, very choppy. There are such great stories out there with nice happy meanings - this was just a woman who wanted a child, nothing really special beyond that. Sorry, not sure what the big deal is about this book."
2,This book makes me sad.,"A new child to most parents is always a joyous occasion (or at least it should). This is especially true to parents who adopt (I am speaking from experience). However, the illustrations in this book depict nothing but sadness. All the characters look as if there is some deep sadness lingering inside. No one smiles... no one celebrates. The words are slightly more joyous than the images, but as they say, ""a picture paints a thousand words.""The other sad aspect of this story is that there is no adoptive father. I know that a dad doesn't have to be present to make an adoption legal, but it leads to a sad life for the child if there isn't a dad. Dads are very important, and this book downplays the importance of that role.The book as a whole is very sad."
4,Just a note:,The version of Saturday Sun is not the version written by Nick Drake... i really dont know what song elton john is singing.
5,GOOD CAREER ADVICE,"I am in the process of trying to find my first international position, and this book provides some excellent advice on how to go about finding a foreign job, and also how to position yourself to get the job after you find it.The chapter on expat contracts is the best source I have found explaining all the various compensation issues in a clear manner - not only what the issues are, but also how compensation packages are structured and what should be covered in the contracts. There is a very complete outline of an expat contract at the end of the chapter.Melton also talks about what the the expat's reasonable expectations should be, explains issues from the employer's perspective and describes what the recent trends are for expatriate benefits and allowances."
2,Not a success,"I've heard that Shalom Aleichem has a great verbal dexterity in the original Yiddish. I have no reason to doubt it, but I have to take it on faith. I also have no complaints about the translation. If the language is not as playful as, say, S.J. Perelman or better episodes of ""Moonlighting,"" well, what do I expect, it's a translation.These novels are not complete failures, but I did not get caught up in them at all, and they kept reminding me of better works. Menachem-Mendl and Motl's family's schemes are so transparently hare-brained and sometimes not quite above board that there was little suspense or sympathy from me. Think Angel from ""The Rockford Files,"" but denser. The second half of ""Motl"" (in America) may be of some sociological interest, but it constantly reminded me of the far superior ""The Rise of David Levinsky."" If you like Shirley Temple movies, you may find this similarly charming."
5,great product!,"This is a great product for grip control in outdoor sports. I use it primarily for rowing, although I know it's also great for tennis and golf. I prefer this brand to others because in addition to staying on through sweating, the product doesn't rub off in the rain like others I've tried."
3,Cute but doesnt stay up,I really loved this and bought it for my yorkie. The tiara is a little heavy so if your pup doesn't have a lot of hair on the top it will not stay up. I tried tying the hair with a rubber band first and then putting the barrette over it but it falls over. Very cute I pin it to the top of her harness but too heavy for her still delicate hair (she's 5 months now).
1,Loud - and mostly useless,If smallest and loudest are what you're going for - this is the fan for you...Otherwise - don't buy it!
1,noisy piece of trash,"This is the cheap garbage that the builders put in even though it is too small to do the job. Might be OK for a closet size bathroom, but I think that is pushing it. For such a small air mover, it sure does make a lot of noise! I think they actually design them noisey so they can get you to upgrade to a silent model."
2,Cheap builder stock..I see an upgrade in your future,"This is the $10 bathroom fan that housing builders will pass off as acceptable for venting each bathroom in your home. This unit only works in a very small bathroom at best and that is if you are a ""short"" duration shower-er. The noise is pretty high considering the low 50 cfm rating...although I bet it has much to do with the small 3"" venting duct. Heck at least you might not forget it running since you can hear it over the TV."
5,Ha what can I say,I take these apart and use them for other things . The price is right and they have so many uses .And if the one in my bathroom get dirty I just use the new cover .
2,"Great game, not so much on pc.","I would give it five stars just because is RE2, but I have a good vista laptop with a Nvidia graphic card and it looks too pixceled. I tried everything but I couldn't watch the cinematics (wich happens to be 25% of the appeal of the game, to me anyways). It also takes a while loading when you open a door or climb down stairs. This game is designed for windows 98 for pete's sake!"
4,i love your game,"... I love the game, it has the best features and it has the best storeline that i have ever seen. The really only problem is that it is to unclear what to do. other than that it is the best game in the world. I am sorry to say that there are no better game than it. It is so easy i have beaten it over 13 times. I really wish you would make more games like it.Thanks ..."
1,Resident Evil 2,"I hate it. The controls are very awkward and you cant use the mouse. The graphics are not that great either. It is not a third person shooter, The screen doesnt move and it is one background after another and different camera angles for each frame, once the charecter would be going in sides and straight ahead in another. It is very hard to move the central charecter, takes a ... of time time you get the correct angle to shoot the zombies following you, how does one play this game with such a bad playability. You would get very far. Bad Bad Bad I hate it."
1,Wicked just wicked,"Is this suppose to be a cool game, I bought it reading all those positive reviews. I cannot understand people like it. The system requirements are quite high. The graphic are not very cool and the control is not very evident. The puzzles are not that fun to solve either, and story what great story does it have. Scary game indeed the zombies move like the baddies in Ed wood's movie and the voice acting is one of the worst even in computer game history. It has a time limit to play and you get to play only for a very short time. It is made by capcom i cant belive they are the same guys who gave classics like Street Fighter. Not even worth one star but unfortunatly can't give less on the amazon."
5,SHOW IS GREAT!,"Yes, the seasons 1 & 2 DVD collection was corrected...and I HOPE that there won't be an errors with Season 3 because I cannot wait to buy it!"
5,Great Import CD,Westlife is an awesome band! I don't know why they aren't very popular in the States. I think their the best boy band around and What Makes a Man is an awesome song. The other two songs on this Import Single are My Girl and I'll Be There. These are classic songs and Westlife does a great job!
3,Many were already opened,"The candy itself is epic, but the only problem i faced is that many of of them were already opened."
1,Way too easy,"I played this game once and it stunk! The music was horrible and the graphics were bad as well. People, my advice is to rent the game first, then buy it. By the way, I beat this game in 3 days."
1,The clock pictured isnt the clock you get,I purchased this clock. However the clock that was delivered did not have a volume control nor did it have an automatic nighttime shut off on the chimes. Talked with Seth Thomas and was advised that the version of the clock they now import does not have these features. Talked with Amazon and they advised that I could return the clock. It is a nice clock but you are not getting was in advertised.
1,Seth Thomas Mantel Clock,"Pretty enough, but I returned this item.This model clock did not include chime volume control and automatic nighttime shutoff as mentioned in the product description. Without those features, it's terribly overpriced."
2,Not happy Jan,I'm glad I din't pay a lot for this 'book' Not a good book for miniature house collectors
1,No stars for this book!,I am amazed at the other reviews of this book. The reviewers must be close personal friends of the author. My conscience won't even let me give this book away.
2,Don't wast your money if you have frameless windows,"I love this product on all my other cars and trucks! But Subaru has a frameless windows, so you have to mount this product so high to clear the door that it really doesn't do much of anything. Save you money if you car has frameless windows."
3,OK but minimal,This all-weather birder's journal is ok. It could be a little larger and there really should be more pages in it. The pages are thinner than I expected and I worry that a drawing might bleed thru the page messing up the next page for drawing on. I like that one side is for drawing and the other side is lined for writing. I also wish the cover was not bright yellow. There is really no reason that the journal does not look more sophisticated.
4,Best Field Observation Journal,Rite-In-The-Rain is the best journal for field observations. This Birder's Field Notebook is good although I have made adaptations for my personal needs and wants. Great for amateur birders and professional alike.
5,Best comparing the cost,Best product when you compare other products' price. It fits in my pocket. It is durable. Survived in sevaral storms.
5,Great-sounding claves!,"I'm not a percussion expert, but I bought these claves for a piece our brass band was playing, where one of the baritone players is supposed to play claves during a solo by another baritone player. They sound just great. With claves, one piece is the ""striker"" and the other is the ""one you hit"" and you are supposed to be able to tell one from the other by the size and shape. These two claves look identical but you can tell which one is the ""striker"" and which one is the ""struck upon"" after experimenting with them for a minute or two; it's very clear which arrangement is best just from playing them. Anyway, great claves for the price!"
2,Good but...,"I do think this is a great resource for typographic inspiration, the problem is this is just a remake of the same publish in 2005. I purchased this book with the assumption it was the an updated version of ""1000 Type Treatments"" but it is just in a different format. The photos are much smaller and less fit on the page than the one I already have. It is rather disappointing and a rather bad marketing job on behalf of Amazon! The problem it is since it was such a cheap by it is not worth selling it back, so now I am stuck with two of the same books with different covers and dimensions.Be aware and make sure you are not buying something you already have."
3,decent reference,"the good: nice examples, good reference bookthe bad: it doesn't mention fonts used in designs. it also uses the same example several times. pictures are to small and sometimes cropped in a weird way."
2,"Great Work, Ruined",This is exactly the way a book on design should NOT be designed. And it's a shame because the editors found a lot of great work that would be inspiring if it weren't presented in an overwrought package with tightly-cropped photos on varying and illogically-colored backgrounds with poor labeling. It is simply too difficult to figure out exactly what one is looking at for the book to be enjoyable.
2,Mildly disappointed,"I'm not sure what my expectations were when I ordered this book however after seeing a number of examples within I had to ask myself, ""Do people really read the copy (or even some of it) from half these designs?""There are some good examples but I find most are impractical to everyday design. I find it hard to believe that stamping a half dozen fonts on top of each other is good communication ""design"" unless maybe it isn't meant to be read.This is a first glance thumbing through of the book and subjective, probably based on personal preference. I see a number of readers liked this book quite well."
4,Legend and such,"As compelling as the movie was, it doesn't compare with the I Am Legend story on the page. Dark, cerebral, yet explicit in its telling of the physical challenges, it keeps you reading. I gave this book as a gift to my nephew who carried it around for weeks."
1,THIS IS NOT A BOOK OF PHOTOGRAPHIC NUDES!!!!!,"For some reason this book is recommended by Amazon when searching for photography books featuring nude females of color. I can see how this title could be mistakenly placed in the database simply because of it's title (which translates to ""Nude Women,Black Women"") however a quick flip through the pages immediately reveals that this some sort of Spanish Novella and not a book of black female nudes. To make matters worse I can't read a lick of Spanish so this book is absolutely useless to me."
3,Kayak Cooking made dooable,"I found this book very usefull. Although it was written with sea kayaks in mind, it will be very usefull for our flatwater camping. It was very informative on breaking down ingredients and packing foods. Cold and dry. How long to store them, and my favorate chapter on how to dry foods in your oven. A very usefull book.Cathy"
3,bob your neck 2 this!,"i think this record proves that most bands that turn out great,such as the lemonheads.already have had great music out before there best known hit.this album-""lick---proves that theory true.give this record a try,if you dont like-ill let you kick me in my teeth!lol!"
2,This is almost not the same band.,"The cd sleeve details the sorry situation of the band at this point as internecine conflict breaks out. Only the cover of ""luka"" makes this a point of curiousty. If you like the later work then you will likely find this a thrashy unrecognisable mess."
4,Good Disc to Get,This is a good disc to add to a Lemonheads collection. It has a few songs from the first Lemonheads full length and some really good pop style punk.
4,End of an era,"Too bad that junkie Evan had to slowly ruin this band. Like most early Lemonhead records, Ben Deily's songs shine on this album. It's not that Evan and his songs are bad, there's just really no comparison though. After this record, the band broke up. But in typical Evan fashion, he afterwards re-formed the band with different people... as if it was only his band. Ben went on to front the generally unheard of Pods, who were quite amazing. If you're looking for a copy of their only cd, Taang! may have a copy or two around, ask 'em. I wish I knew what Ben was up to now. It's too bad really... darn Evan..."
5,The State of Texas Rocks!,"Enjoyed the Oddball Texas book while taking trips around Texas!! Helps you see things you'd never think to stop and look at!! Some are strange, but for the most part had some pretty cool stuff in it :)"
4,A complete guide to garde manger,"This book is a complete professional's guide to understanding and putting into practice the art of garde manger. This was my textbook in culinary school for garde manger class, and it covers all the essentials from sausage making, cold salads, and hot hors d'oeuvres to platter design, edible and nonedible garnishes and decorations, and classical buffet presentations. It may not be suitable for the casual cook, but as a professional guide to the garde manger, it is very thorough."
2,Dissapointing,"Just by looking at the cover page and the other reviewer comments, I thought I was buying a great book.The book has very few pictures and these pictures not always represent items you will find in the book. For instance, there is a full-page photograph of a terrific morel terrine, whose recipe is missing in the book!.The book is a collection of recipes rather than an instruction book on decoration, menu layouts, buffet planifications, etc, although these issues are shortly covered.To be honest, I find the book out of date. Cold food goes well beyond what this book offers. Too much gelatine and liver. A much better book is ""Garde Manger : The Art and Craft of the Cold Kitchen"" which I highly recommend."
5,THE BUNNY KICKS BUTT!,"I've done my own un-official testing of Energizer Vs. Duracelon MANY occassions; keeping track of the amount of play-timeI could get out of each, while using them in portable TapePlayers and C.D. Players over a period of approximately 10Years. Without question, Energizer wins ........................PLUS, THE LIL' BUNNY'S JUST PLAIN CUTE!(***My only complaint: I wish they'd make up their minds andCONSISTENTLY put the Testers on ALL of their Battery Sizes!)."
4,Excellent accessory for my Visor,"I find batteries improved the productivity of my new Visor a great deal. Before I placed a couple batteries into the ""battery port"", I had a terrible time getting my Visor to Hot-Sink and the display was completely unreadable.At first I had trouble fitting them into the springboard port, but after exhaustive search, I found a specific ""Battery Port"" that they fit into quite nicely. I guess I'll have to wait a little longer for the springboard battery module.Also make sure that the small ""+"" and ""-"" symbols match those in the battery port. I think future versions of the battery modules should only go in one way to avoid accidentally placing them in the device incorrectly."

1,Checker Power by Robert W. Pike,"Today I received my copy of ""Checker Power by Robert W. Pike. I was excited about advancing my knowledge and skills in the game of checkers. I spent the next '10' minutes reading this (book). Each set of pages contain, (on one page), a LARGE checker board which takes up the entire page. The opposite page contained at least 'one' (usually small), paragraph explaining the absolute most basic aspects of checkers. If you have ever played even one game of checkers, you know more than all the knowledge contained in this (book). I say (book) in parenthesis because this should be classified as a PAMPHLET. The entire book contained about 40 or 50 paragraphs..!! Need I continue!. AOL, please do us a favor and remove this ""PAMPHLET"" so others will not have to pay the postage to get this PAMPHLET and the postage to RETURN this PAMPHLET.! Richard Mathis rdsupply@easilink.com"
1,Checker Power,Very disapointed. I did not lean anything new. I expected some good stratagies for winning the game.I think any thinking person would already know the tips they gave.
2,Elementary checkers,This was a very basic explanation of the game of checkers. Not much help in planning strategies to win.
2,not even worth 5 bucks,Persuaded by other reviewers i bought star gladiator and immediately after playing i was disappointed. The word craptastic comes to mind. After trying out 3 or 4 characters i feel i can say it's ugly and slow even for when it came out. I'll play rival schools or virtual fighter for a 3-D fighting experience.
1,This is not The Brains!!!,"I already wrote this review forever ago but it was somehow deleted from Amazon. THIS IS NOT THE BRAINS! The classic band from Atlanta that gave us ""Money Changes Everything"" and ""Heart In The Street"", not to mention a couple of invaluable new wave lps on Mercury, is nowhere in sight here. Hey, clueless ones, note to self. When you name your band, make sure it's not the same name as a band that was, in the not-so-distant-past, not only popular but quite influential."
1,had to return,"The watch I received didnt keep time; it ran way fast. I returned it. If I could figure out how to remove the one star that is chosen in the rating, I would do so."
2,the switch is already broken,This is tough. The lamp is great. It uses a regular light bulb with enough wattage to actually provide a genuine working light and the magnification is fine. But the on/off switch broke the first day. Fortunately it failed in the 'on' position so I've put all of the desk lights on one power strip and I turn them on at its main switch. Bummer.
1,Non-Working - Poor Customer Service,"This item arrived on time - but in non-working condition. It appeared to be a returned item and had no instructions included. I requested a replacement; however, customer service was a zero and I had no response from them. I was looking forward to this item for my 97 year old grandmother - oh well. Amazon guarantee was great, though. No complaints with them at all."
5,"Well built, solid light","This desk light was a great deal for the money, and is very bright, given the reflector. Build quality is good as joints are riveted and don't fall apart. Arrived promptly as advertised."
1,3 Step Approach to Better Jumping: Beginning Program,"Book ordered in October...delivery date by end of Feb...Feb comes...new delivery date of May!....just tell me you don't have it. Need to edit title...your web site spelled ""approach"" wrong."
3,"Good, but not as good as it could be","I've read many self-help books, but I was a little disappointed. It wasn't as ""deep"" as I was hoping; if you are used to reading books by Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer and Esther Hicks, you may be let down. I also thought it would be more useful to have exercises in this book. A lot of it is just full of quotes and stories of other people that I have heard a million times before, unfortunately."
5,"Deep, Truthful, and Spot On!","Wow! Excellent, excellent book! DO NOT judge this book by its cover -- meaning, do not think that the photo and tag line/subtitle are indicative of this being a ""chick book"". It is about the brutal reality of self-discovery -- the deep, honest, self-observed truth within -- and being able (or learning) to see things, ourselves, and experiences in life for what they really are and not the delusional, denial-based fantasies we often times try to convince ourselves that they are. I've read this book twice and still come away with one word that sticks in my mind to describe it -- ""raw"". It's a must read for anyone searching to honor and find a deeper understanding of their own brutally honest ""truths"" and ""authenticity""."
1,"dull, boring & useless","robotic unoriginal words that you'll most likely find in a chain letter. couldn't finish this book as I do not have that taj mahal mindset and loose clothing.most likely a good read for recovering drug addicts and/or alcoholics, divorcees, etc"
4,good dvd,"the DVD holds a wealth of information, if self help is what you are looking for. Makes you think about your current position in life and then you can move on from here."
2,too touchy feely,This book was too touchy feely for me and did not have much practical information that would result in real change.
4,Buy it!,"Perfect blend of pure hip hop with some great soul vocals. I will continue to support them. I can't compare them to anyone, but if you put together classic boom-bap with the soulful voice of N'Dea Davenport, you'll have an idea. Once again, buy it and support these great artists. PURITY!"
4,By Far the Best Rae & Christian (So Far),"Northern Sulphuric Soul is even better than their newer releases. If you've just heard of them, you should start with this album. It's been three years since I've heard this album, so the novelty effect kind of wore off. Nonetheless, it won't disappoint you. Rae & Christian carries with them a defining sound with melodies that shame the music makers of pop musicians (i.e. Britney, and all these pop icons with perfect little bodies and no real talent other than to pose and wink and scream). If you want me to sum up what Rae and Christian sound like... it's like the jazz-pop of downtempo. It's how a lot of people think of Thievery Corp and K&D, but they are still, very very good."

1,RIA Federal Tax Handbook 2002 : With Cpe Quizzer,"I don't know what planet your on. Its obvious to me that its not the Earth. Why? Because I haven't received this book yet!I ordered this book on January 2, 2002. Here it is March 20, 2002. I wanted this book to help my customers out since I'm an IRS Enrolled Agent. You still haven't delivered it! The tax season is almost over! You've always advertised that you carry a wide selection of books with quick guaranteed delivery. Here it is March 20, 2002 and I still have not received the book.I still want it! But can you deliver it to me? Your web site says the book will be shipped February 20th. Well its March 20! Can you deliver this book by April 15th?Its apparent my order has not been updated since early February. Do you guys need some revenue?Please write me or call (714) 562-6285 I would appreciate an explanation.I hope someone is reading this review and that you can come through and fill this order for me."
5,Aprendiendo temas útiles en inglés,Este libro ayuda mucho a los niños que están aprendiendo a hablar inglés sobre una tematica tan cotidiana como necesario como es la identificación de los colores. Sus ilustraciones son de mucha ayuda. Excelente complemento del aprendisaje en ingles.!
2,Not a true concept book,"I wanted to use this to teach my son colors. I thought each color would show real items that come in that color. For instance, green would show grapes, a plant, broccoli, etc. Instead, it shows bears dressed in green playing with green paint and some trees. And this goes for every color. Not a useful book at all. I tried to return it, but they let me keep it for free. I still don't use it!"
5,Passed my real estate test,This book was a life saver. The practice tests helped me tremendously with passing the Massachusetts Real Estate test the first time. Would highly recommend.
2,Americans' Efforts to Learn Buddhism,"This book depicts an important period in Master Hsuan Hua's work to introduce Orthodox Chinese-style Buddhism to America, along with previously unknown approaches to Buddhist practice. Embarking on a traditional-type pilgrimage through California, authors Heng Sure and Heng Chau write letters to their master, displaying remarkably un-Buddhistic self-obsession, which makes for sometimes tedious reading. But the letters are juxtaposed with the transcendental wisdom of Master Hua and quotations from the Avatamsaka Sutra. While the 2 monks' spiritual growth is not evident in this volume, they certainly deserve an A for Effort."
1,I don't like the taste,"I have used this for a couple weeks. I won't be buying it anymore because of the taste. It has a very funny taste, and I dread drinking it every morning, but want to finish my jar. Not for me."
4,"New Perspectives Good, and Traditionally Based","As a student of 'standardized' TCM, I find Mark Seem's approach refreshing. Doctors of old examined the body with their hands, and directly percieved the subtle Qi and it's state within the body. Actually palpating the body and seeing the truth and information there, instead of intellectually deciding on a diagnosis via symptoms of the patient(accuracy questionable), is something we can all learn from....that is, the hands on approach."
4,Refreshing,"I trained in acupuncture some 25 years ago: at a time when contemporary chinese rigidity was just beginning to creep in and edge traditional practices on to the sidelines. Unfortunately, it has since come to dominate, negating the art and skill of the practitioner to the point where he or she is effectively redundant and software can diagnose and prescribe. Some people may enjoy being treated by a computer. I'm not one of them.Any book that pushes both experienced and would-be therapists into thinking differently has to be good! You don't have to believe every theory or strategy, but it is healthy to contemplate alternative possibilities and even try them.By the way, is it my imagination or do the negative reviews appear to be written by the same none too literate reviewer?"
3,AcuSpa,"I had really high hopes for this book. It really needs to greatly improve its index, as it should be more diversified for those who read just portions of books at times. His writing style really killed me..... There are some positives. If you don't know trigge point therapy and are an acupunturist, this book could be helpful. I enjoy meridian therapy, but he kills me with the dull writing style."
3,Interesting,I am a descendant of Olive Boone. I was delighted to read about my 5x Great-Grandmother's life. The stories still tend to be more about the men than the women. I'm sure that's because there is so much more information about them. I found it an interesting read.
1,Biased and Trite,"This work denotes nothing of true insight or interest. I was amazed at the general obviousness of this text, along with the manicured ""perspective"", that was nothing but book read.I suspect Ms. Dunung has never even been to Asia, for, as a business man myself who has been working there for many decades, I see no hard earned knowledge or awareness in her assuptions."
1,not the discord hoover,"This is not the Hoover that we know and love from DC. This is nothing like the beauty of Route 7. Any other review of this cd is probably trying to get you to pay exorbitant amounts for a used cd of a poor, untalented band."
3,With reservations,"The content of this book is beyond criticism, it being a wonderful selection of English poetry. The accompanying history and notes are also interesting and educational. However, it is impossible to navigate to individual poems, or even to the different centuries into which the book is divided. The reader has to start at the beginning and read to the end, which is not the usual way anthologies are meant to be used. This is frustrating."
4,six centures of english poetry,material is great but i would recommend spending a bit of extra money to have an interactive table of contents and make it easier to access your favorite poem for your mood of the moment
1,Usual stuff,I Didnt find it appealing. I found he choice of poems were predictable and the layout was very stiff and unappealing.
5,Arthurs New Puppy,I bought for my grandson who has Cerebal Palsy and is Autistic.He enjoys them even though he does not talk. Great entertainment for him.Loves all movies.
2,"It's fine...But if you love this, you have issues","Folks who LOOOOVE this album, then call later LEMONHEADS ""wimpy"" ""60's sounding"" and ""changed by major labels"" are obviously still in high school, or just immature and don't really like MUSIC...They like a SCENE. Namely punk. If it ain't fast and sloppy, then it ain't good to these folks.This record is passable garage pop. It's fine, really. But any actual fan of music and songwriting will say this band didn't really get cooking until their 3rd record, LICK, and didn't hit a homerun until IT'S A SHAME ABOUT RAY.And yeah, I'm actually just as big a punk fan as the folks who love this album, but that also gives me the knowledge that there's a LOT better than this in the genre.Get this if you're a fan of the LEMONHEADS and want everything they did. Or get this if you only like one style of music; punk.Otherwise, don't start here if you're just testing the band out. They were like 18, for chrissakes. How good could it be?"
1,The further back you go the worse you get,This mess of a collection has only one quality - it's so short with most songs checking in at less than 2min 30s. This must be Evan's relative who is involved because it sure ain't him. British athlete Suzanne Dando showed more musical prowess than this cd of garage band scraps. Hate your friends - them send them this.
3,Slightly disappointing,"I was simply disappointed. The photographs are nice. How can you go wrong with photographs of people - especially nudes. Always interesting, always beauty. But if you are drawn to buy this book with any intellectual curiosity regarding Russia, Nudism, aethetics .. I suspect you will be diappointed. There is very little text, very little thought expressed, as is implied in some of their marketing."
4,Very nice book of naturist photography.,"I purchased this book because of an interest in the naturist/nudist lifestyle. I have always enjoyed the naked, female form and this is one way of pursuing that interest. The book is well written, forgiving any translation errors. The photography is very good, with the subjects well placed and well lit. The subjects are photographed in natural settings, doing everyday things, like swimming at the beach, or enjoying a picnic lunch. The only difference is that they are nude.If you are seeking pornographic images, you won't find them in this book. The photographs are aesthetically pleasing and artistic in nature. The subjects are mainly young females. Young, as in teens to early 20's. While this may bother some people, there is nothing lewd about their posing or the manner in which they are presented. Think Jock Sturges, or Sally Mann for a reference to style and composition.Overall, a very nice book."
3,"No, there is just ONE ALBUM on this disc!!","The 2-on-1 format of this title has been out of print for a couple of years. These days, if you order this title from ANY seller, you will get a CD with the tracks from ""Kill Kill Kill"" ONLY. The two albums were re-mastered and re-issued SEPARATELY. The track list above has yet to be updated. Don't be misled!Trust me. I just completed a five-week global search for the original 2-on-1 format. It is impossibly rare, as are some other older deleted ""two-fer"" CD's on Taang! Records. Have fun!"
5,For your Eyes Only,"This is a most facinating book, I originally bought it because I had read Franks other book on Bowen therapy and I was really interested in what he had to say. This book is so well written that even an ordinary person like me can understand what he has to say. I was able to get my head round what Frank says within a day and then use the book for reference. This book is not just about iridology (though that is what it is mainly about) but it has a section in it about how the body heals and the stages it goes through to do this. The book is in full colour and with lots of photographic examples and of course the iridology maps. Frank has an egerness to share his knowledge with the world, and through his easy to read style I am sure he will reach and teach every one who reads his work."
5,WONDERFUL BRITISH FILM,"The Way Ahead is Excellent piece of British Film Making,documentary-like and has shows the evolution of some stalwart civilians being educated in the tactical principles of battle in North Africa. It is filled with important star performances and highlights teamwork and togetherness in the war effort.The Director Sir Carol Reed succinctly captures the spirit of the events.Strangely this 1.33:1 film has been matted to a 960 anamorphic transfer while maintaining the original aspect ratio 4.3. Hence there are thick black bars on the side edges. The resulting image is in-and-around 720 pixels wide. The dual-layered image comes from an impressive source. Contrast is reasonably strong and detail surprisingly good. There isn't any intrusive damage and only minor speckles deviating from a pristine smooth appearance.In a couple of words Superb Transfer.Thanks VCI."
1,Bait and Switch,"The copy I was promised was ""Used - like new"", the copy I recieved was in poor condition -- stained, pages creased, browning with age. Before I recieved it, the vendor had given me a $6 refund because of ""potential condition issues"". If I had wanted a copy in poor condition, I would have ordered one. I would not use this vendor again."
4,888888.,"this disc marks my first exposure to takemura, and i can't say i'm disappointed by any means. tracks 1 and 5 sound to me like Lovesliescrushing doing quirky techno stuff (that's a good thing, mind you), track 2 sounds like Aphex Twin and Squarepusher spun together, complete with drill n' bass ""beats,"" but a bit more minimal than either of the aforementioned artists (this is also good); track 3 is a repetitive soundscape which is rather interesting though probably my least favorite; track 4 is also long and repetitive, but based around a very appealing melody and this quirky, child-like french singing; track 6 is a live performance of track 2 (you wouldn't guess upon first listen that such a track *could* be performed live.) all in all, this is a high-quality disc ... brings a smile to my face."
4,Good Book,"I became a Dad on August 25, 2007. In preparation for having a child, I read this book. It was helpful to me.I was concerned about being a Dad due to my up-bringing. The book was practical, insightful, and a easy read.I even passed it on to someone I knew who was about to be a Dad also."
1,Ok,"This is a very cool product, but unfortunately not of good quality. It was bought for my sons birthday and we blew it up a couple hours before... It was popped and deflated before anyone even showed up. Very disappointing."
4,toy lasted all summer,"I bought this for my youngest son. He is almost 4, so pushing the maxium age range on this toy. The red has faded to a dark pink, but it hasn't popped yet.The yellow inflatable seat is absolutely useless. Toss it or use it for a bath pillow.Great place to store other pool toys when not in use.Lasted from July until august when our dog got a hold of it."
3,"Product Seems Fine, but Amazon Lied to Me!?","I bought this valve PCV Valve for a 2000 Ford Focus SE, SOHC 2.0 SPI. The part finder at the top of the page said it woud fit the vehicle but it does not. I ended up getting one from the dealer because I had to buy a special order part anyway. I should have pulled out the old one first and I would have known right away that its not the same design. I needed the plastic one that twists into place and has a square plastic lip just above the O-Ring. Double check before you purchase..."
4,"One terrific film, two terrific prints...","Catcom's double feature 'Of Human Bondage' alongside 'Eternally Yours' represents the best-looking print of either title I've yet seen in the foggy, unremastered realm of public-domain releases. Cromwell's fine 'Bondage' (4 stars) is a must-have for fans of the book, Bette Davis or the under-appreciated Leslie Howard. Garnett's 'Eternally Yours' (2 1/2 stars) is an uneven, brisk (too brisk) muddle of a screwball comedy/drama salvaged only by pleasing performances from Niven, Loretta Young and its superb supporting cast. Problem is, in my experience, the versions of both movies available to date are taken from such poor sources they're painful to sit through, bordering on unwatchable. Catcom to the rescue, with some fun, though nonessential, extras to boot. Note: 'Bondage' is sharper and cleaner than 'Eternally Yours,' with better sound, but given the films' comparative merit, the disparity in picture quality isn't too bothersome."
4,BLAME OUR GOVERNMENT,"This is in response to J. Winchester (Southern CA)review. The reason a lot of these immigrants are here is because of what our government has been doing in their contries for years. If you are familiar with the IRAN-Contra affairs you would know that our government secretly funded wars in Latin America. In El Salvador in particular they help train and gave weapons to a regime that supported death squads killed the arcbishop and murdered American nuns. Basically these immigrants are here because of what are government did to them and their homeland. I am from L.A. and in 29 years I have never seen a ""we don't serve Gringos"" sign anywhere in my city. Please stop with the hate propoganda. We want cheap labor, maids, nannys, gardeners, fruits, vegetables, and cloths but aren't willing to pay the price. Unless you are a Native American your families were immigrants at some point in time. KNOW YOUR HISTORY!"
3,disappointing,"This was a pretty good book until the ending. I could not wait to get there and when I did it made me want to throw the book away. The characters were good and the setting and all but there were a lot of things that left me wondering. The ending made me want to say ""It that all there is."" I would not recommend this book."
3,"not ""The Fugs""","After seeing the Fugs in a live show, I started buying their more recent recordings to hear how the new Fugs records were. Well this is not ""the Fugs"" This group is Fug (no S, no The) These guys are French, and a totally different band. I wrote this review to warn other fans of ""THE FUGS"" not to buy it by mistake. That said, I still listened to the Cd and found the music was not that bad. The female singer had a good voice, and most tracks are instrumental funky kind of stuff. So the bottom line is: If your a Fugs fan, as in NYC Fugs from the 1960's,DO NOT BUY THIS. It is not The Fugs. If you like lounge type bands, then you might like this, as it is not horrible."
2,RC Revenge Pro,"I got this title as a alternative game for my younger daughter. The graphics are ok (I rechecked the box to see if I had a PS1 game). The controls are simple. The game tracks take an extreme amount of sharp turns in an attempt to increase its difficulty, but only increases its frustration. The worlds are bright but not fun. Save your money for a better title."
2,Box art looks good...,"But's that pretty much shows the best parts of the game. The graphics are good, but I found that the tracks were very hard to follow, and the time that it took to get where the game was fun took too long. This game seems to try to be like Mario Kart, but it just doesn't pull it off. If you're looking for a fun, silly time, don't get this game...you will only end up frustrated."
1,not worth renting,I rented this because I absolutely love CTR and there aren't that many games out there like it but this game isn't good graphic wise and it's really hard to steer. There aren't enough arrows to show you where to go and it's all guessing.
2,RENT THIS FIRST !,"I wish I would have..Graphics are pretty nice, movement is true to an r/c type car..But the game is missing something FUN ...I did not like this game..."
2,Disapointed,I did not know the book was the early addition. It showed the new version and I got the old brown one
1,Leninist Nonsense,What is one to think of a book which holds that American Socialism needed more Leninism? Not much!
3,Does not fit 2 different cars I have tried.,"Firstly, I really liked the size weight and shape. The finish wasn't flawless. I bought this for my late 80's mitsubishi pick-up. Despite having 3 different thread sizes, none fit. I also tried to give it away and it didn't fit on a Nissan 240sx. Once you secure threaded insert inside it's not coming out so be careful with that. Really wish it fit."
1,Waste of time.,It was of waste of time and a waste of money for me. It is no way big enough for my 96 F150 gear shift. And the ball itself is too small for me to drill out the 3/4 inch hole I need.
4,The universal thread is a bit to universal.,The universal thread is a bit to universal. If you want this to fit most of the way down the thread you will have to drill out 1/2 of the threaded insert. After it has been drilled it screws all the way down. if you are interested in making this fit the rest of the way a bit of 2 part epoxy makes a pretty decent bond.
1,notsogood,"never get to see a complete performance-only brief clips---""interviews"" are lengthy monologues that are not all that interesting"
2,too much talking,"This should be subtitled A Celtic Windbaggery, as the music presented is constantly interrupted by the talking of the various artists who verbally have much less to offer than when interpreting their songs, more accurately described as neo-Celtic. I noted also the new pronunciation of Celtic as Keltic and wondered who thought this up and managed to get it propagated. Obviously, where language is concerned, imitation, repetition and mindlessness go hand in hand. The music is pleasant to listen to, and all the players/singers have something to offer, but on this recording there is no way to really enjoy the music. Unless you enjoy hearing the pompous jerks who talk, talk and then talk again on PBS, this is not for you."
4,Darling and cuddly for the little cowgirl,"My 9 yr old daughter is horse crazy! And she loves ""Cinnamon"". It is beautifully made and so soft. It is smaller than I expected, but you cannot judge by a picture. It may not be sturdy enough for a toddler or younger. but overall a very nice toy for a school age child."
2,Barely adequate,"I picked these up as a temporary measure after leaving my Apple earbuds at home. They're loose-fitting, somewhat muted or ""distant"" sounding (little ambient sound is required to make them inaudible), and have limited frequency coverage. Worth no more than several bucks, and best for uses like talking books. The Sony MDR-21 earbuds are ten times the quality at less than twice the price."
5,Please write the next in the series!!!!!!!!,"I agree with the other two reviews entirely. I am also awaiting with bated breath the third (and fourth?) book(s) in the series. The last line of this book is something like: ""We have won the battle, now for the war to begin!"" (Not an exact quote, but you get the idea!)So, where is the next book? I hope they write it soon!"
1,There won't be another book.,"I actually had the fortune a few years back, after I read the ""most recent"" book in the series, to have an email exchange with the authors. I had recalled them saying, although I no longer remember the source, that now that they had returned to the series, they promised to finish the series. That, unfortunately, is my only issue with the authors and the series. When I asked them about that promise, they told me they would never finish the series, or publish another book in the series. I understand that their other books are probably far more lucrative, and I know they have other things going on besides just writing, and I applaud them for that. I, however, detest a promise made and not followed through, better to make no promises at all...."
3,"Enjoyable, with characters you want to meet again.","If you enjoyed SHIFTER, chances are you'll like NIGHTFEEDER too. Galen continues his quest for a way into the First World and meets up with some new, and even more dangerous characters along the way. The baddies from the first book also return."
4,good buy,i think this home theatre system is great for the pricei am a woman and i installed it myself that was a plus the only thing that i had problems with is the instruction manual it could have been a little more user friendly
3,"watch good, band breaks","The watch itself is great. My band, a fast wrap, lasted more than a year, and then broke. Good watch, but really needs a better quality band."
5,"Fun, Whimsical Hooks",These make me smile everytime I look at them...perfect for a kitchen or laundry room.
3,A Indonesian famous intellectual thought,"Written in Bahasa (Indonesian language), this book tells about an Indonesian famous intellectual, the late Soedjatmoko, the former Rector of United Nation University in Tokyo, Japan. This book mainly discusses about Soedjatmoko contribution to Indonesian history --both as influential diplomat in a time of revolution and historian in historical science."
1,This is Sunny Ozuna!!!!!!!! Pleaseeeeee!!!!!!!!!!,"This is Sunny Ozuna not in the prime of his career. I'm from San Antonio Texas home of Sunny Ozuna, when he was with the Stardusters,the Sunglows and finally his own band the Sunliners. This is one CD not to get, you will be disappointed! His earlier recordings are avaliable again on CD here in San Antonio. Look for them and hear Sunny at his best and he was. I remember going to see Sunny, listening and dancing to his music. Those were the good old days. Still listen to Sunny's music as often as I can. Get the old original music and you won't be disappointed."
2,Sunny Ozuna sings his old great hits.,"I was disappointed with this CD because I was looking for Ozuna's original recordings. Unfortunately, this album contains remakes. Some of the songs don't even sound the same as the original recordings."
5,Sunny Ozuna,This CD was ok. I got this CD because all of the songs on this CD remind me of my Dad. He passed away (going on 4 years) and hearing a CD with all his favorite music was great.Hopefully I will find some more CD'S like this one in the future!
4,Month by Month Write and Read Books,"This is a great book for teachers of grades k-2, who are teaching emergent readers and writers. This book includes the purpose of each month's book, how to assemble the books, suggestions for incorporting it, and some wonderful extension activities for each one. I think this book is a nice addition to any k-2 teachers library for teaching reading and writing."
3,Meh....,"I enjoy classic sporting literature, and while Charles Fergus is a respected author, and this is my first book of his, I am left somewhat unimpressed. I won't go so far as ""Dr Cardinal"", who I think is a troll, but I will say there is a lot of empty prose here. An overabundance of filler material detailing ad nauseum the types of trees, plants and shrubs he saw wears thin quickly. There is a tone of bitterness here that doesn't sit well. I fully understand what he lost, and that he laments it, but he just doesn't make the point effectively, instead sounding a bit like a bitter person. Surely he's been through more hardship with his family, and we don't wish that on anyone, but it doesn't reach the heights I hoped given the reviews. Fair to Fair Plus."
2,Bored out of my mind.,"Savage is so self absorbed and concious of who he might offend it's as if he is writing for his family and friends. He doesn't take chances with his writing, playing it safe for the most part...the rest is just boring. His other book, ""The Kid"" isn't much better. I will not buy a book by him again."
2,Proof that Gay Marriage is as Boring as Straight Marriage,Dan and his partner fight. Sometimes their kid loves them and sometimes he thinks they are lame. A whole book of boring details about Dan Savage. Not as good as his other stuff.Oh. And Dan should not be allowed to have kids for two reasons.1) He's an American male who doesn't know how to drive2) He doesn't like Chinese food.QED
3,Kindle Version Full of Errors,"I just finished reading ""The Commitment"" on Kindle and am appalled at how many typographical errors there are--at least a dozen, if not more. I wonder if this is the same for the print version. I am annoyed that the Kindle version is more expensive than the print version yet the proofreading in the Kindle version is sloppy and lazy.I enjoyed the writing but the sheer number of mistakes certainly detracted from my ability to fully enjoy the book. If I was a teacher grading this book, I would give it a B- due to the sloppy proofreading. Do we no longer live in a society where correct spelling, grammar, use of prepositions, and punctuation count?"
4,A Good Read,"An excellent sequel to Savage's The Kid. Funny, heartwarming, and thought-provoking all at the same time."
5,please write more about your life,"touching and hilarious. i love his characterizations of his mom and the touch of political as well. please write more about your family, dan!"
5,Another great Savage memoir,"In the same way that his previous memoir, The Kid, dealt with the open adoption of their infant son, D.J., Dan Savage's The Commitment covers the issue of marriage as he and his boyfriend, Terry, try to decide whether to tie the knot. Over the course of the book, Savage looks at different aspects of marriage from a series of perspectives.Perhaps the most ironic obstacle was their six-year-old son, who insisted that two guys couldn't get married. The chapter, ""Two Moments of Transcendent Bliss,"" is killer: Savage answers D.J.'s questions about what gay/straight is and why people want to marry. It's beautifully done.The book in general is satisfying both intellectually and emotionally. Anyone who says gays don't have ""traditional family values"" or that they don't make good parents should be required to read this book. I really appreciate Savage's skill in writing about his life (and the lives of others) with a deft balance of pragmatism, humor, and compassion."
5,Fun & Informative,"This documentary should equally satisfy those already familiar with Dali and those who know nothing about him. I can't imagine anyone not being entertained by this display of Dali's unique personality. Passionate admires of Dali may find it difficult to view the footage of the Divine Dali not looking so divine in the 80's. A huge plus is the sub-titles even when Dali is speaking in English. Some important people are interviewed such as Man Ray, Max Ernst and Albert Field (author of the must have Official Catalog of the Graphic Works of Salvador Dali) among others. I saw this documentary two nights in a row and enjoyed it just as much the second time around."
1,Misleading description,"I had to return this item because it just comes with the screen - NOT THE GAZEBO. You need to purchase the gazebo too in order to use the curtain screen. I wish Amazon would say in the description ""the gazebo is not included"" so customers would know."
1,Dated Material,"The text is outdated and amaturerish. I should have checked the Pub date, 1996. Not focused on 'design' firms or archectitural disciplines. Metods and techniques are now 'old-school' guerilla marketing methods. Save your money and buy good quality business cards.(a former ad agency owner, always looking for ideas, this one was poor) Builder257"
3,Expecting something better,"After hearing high praise for Tom Holt, I decided to give him a try. I picked this book at random, and I was sorry I did. The plot, which is thin, was a loose idea around which several vague (and often un-funny) comedy skits orbited. Worse still, the plot is the same one that every thirteen-year old develops after reading Douglas Adams for the first time... God goes on vacation, hilarity follows. Well, laughter follows. Well, mild chuckling follows.Not that it was a total loss... the idea of Hell having embassies on Earth is interesting. However, I will not be recommending this book to friends any time soon.I can only say one positive thing about Only Human. It wasn't God-awful. In fact, it was cute in parts. I will be giving Tom Holt another try, and read Expecting Someone Taller or Who's Afraid of Beowulf. But this one will sit at the bottom of my bookshelf, next to the Piers Anthony books, collecting dust."
1,Only use where Explosions are acceptable,I used these batteries in a camera flash and they exploded leaving me with a paper weight. Try Duracell a much more durable product.
3,Duracells are better,"Some people may like the Bunny, but I prefer the Copper Tops. They just seem to last longer. They at least look like they last longer.Why batteries might be seen as educational toys, I don't know. Maybe with a few wires, swtiches and light bulbs."
5,Value buy,Excellent product. Value buy as I bought for very low price.I have used this cable only for few hours. During trials - it improved my data transfer speed from average 15 MBPS (with USB) to average 100 MBPS (with eSATA to eSATA) keeping all other conditions same. As written earlier - cable is bit stiff but the cable and connectors are with quality finish. I would reccoment this product.
5,Works exactly as needed for great price,"Not much to say, works fine and was a great price. No need to spend too much for a name brand."
3,Intermittent connection,"The cable is stiff, as some have noted. I also had problems with securing the plug into the drive and into the back of the computer. The connection would fail at times and I would have to resecure the plug."
1,cables way to slow for video,I bought this cable to hook up my external hard drive to my laptop and it sucks for video transfer. Everything skips and loads so slow I can't watch anything. Might be ok for basic file transfer but sucks for media. The only reason I kept it was as a last resort for basic file transfers.
3,poetic ramblings,"RAY is an amusing read. you want to know who he'll screw next and what kind of crazy southern characters he'll encounter; but it is messy and doesn't try to be linear or cohesive. while that is not a bad thing, i did not find his poetic, wannabe faulkner style that engaging. if you really want to read about rednecks and how they live and feel, stick to larry brown or harry crews. but this does have merit as a quick read."
3,Not The Typical Teen Horror Film,"This movie reminded me a bit of Scream and Carrie...and a mixed bag of other teen-party-gone-enormously-wrong films. This low budget movie has everything in it, from the social outcast and popular kids, to naked girls and a creepy house holding them hostage. At the center of all the screaming and mayhem is the strained romance between two of the characters. I really would have liked to have seen more of this. Maybe there will be an Almost Invisible 2. Throughout the movie you wonder what the heck happens to some of these kids. Are they dead, alive, hiding, or what? It all makes sense in the end. There was enough gore and plot twists to keep me well entertained."
4,A fun ride,"I thought this film was a great addition to my library, being a collector of slasher films, This was great and a must for my collection, i wanna watch it again loved it."
4,A fun thriller!,I loved the concept!! I am a sucker for good gory thriller's and I would definitely recommend this one. It was a lot of fun!!
2,"Cheap product, poor picture","I bought the MS Lifecam 1000 for skype. The picture was not sharp or very bright. The camera did not sit well on any surface, it could easily be disrupted. Although the mic did pick up sound very well. I have since replaced it."
4,good product,"I bought this for proctor testing for online classes. The quality of the pic is not great. I have not used the sound so I do not know what to expect. I also have never used another cam like this so the quality may be very good. I don't know. Overall, it does a great job for what I need it for and it's a good price."
1,dysfunctional webcam,I purchased two Microsoft LifeCam VX-1000 neither of which are functional. I have been unable to find any contact either on-line or by Microsoft LifeCam VX-1000 Black Webcam - 64L00003 / 64L-00003telephone to help me make these units work which has made them useless.
3,Could be better,"This product has a built in mike, and capable of taking still shots and motion video. The images are grainy. Otherwise, good for the novice."
2,"It's in a drawer right now, does that tell you anything?","I hooked it up and it works fine. But it only seems to work with Windows Messenger, and I primarily use yahoo. It's probably a case of me not reading all the fine print before I purchased it, but shouldn't all webcams work with whatever program accesses it? It doesn't make sense that it only works with WM.The positive notes are it's very small and sits nicely on my flatscreen monitor. I just wish it would work in the way I want it to. I mean, my HP printer doesn't require I use all HP software to use it. I can hit print in any application and it will work. Why doesn't this work the same way?"
3,Not working on Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy,Couldn't get this to work properly on Ubuntu 8.04. Also got the QuickCam Connect which didn't work either. Finally got the QuickCam Messenger which worked including the microphone out of the box.
5,Works great with Skype,I bought this for my grandparents because they live far away and would be nice to see them when we talk. This works perfect. It isn't the best quality but I can see them good enough and you can't beat it for 20 bucks. I think it might also have something to do with the speed of their connection...but we are able to see and hear each other perfectly. We're very pleased with it.
5,Great Little Web Cam,"I purchased this camera to chat with my granchildren who are a 1000 miles away.The Web Cam was easy to install, and the picture and video are crisp. I would recommend this camera to ""us older"" gang who are challenged when it come to these types of computer items.I can now visit my grandchildren anytime I want, thanks to this Microsoft Lifecam.A great buy and a better investment."
4,Microsoft LIfecam VX-1000 - Review,The installation of this webcam is no problem. Very easy and comes with the Live Messenger v8.1 . Resolution is pretty good but not the best. It's a very cool design that can either clip onto a laptop screen or sit on a desk.The bad things - The resolution could be better. the microphone is a little weak (ex. you wouldn't be able to step very far away from your computer and at times may have to talk a little louder). The software does take a while to install - long enough to make me wonder what was being put on my computer.
5,Very pleasantly surprised,"I bought this camera to replace a Logitech QuickCam Fusion. I'd been having problems with Skype, all of which seemed related to the Fusion.This camera's image in significantly better than the Fusion's in my (not so great) office lighting. That's quite an accomplishment, considering the Fusion is a current product and sells for three times the price of this camera. I recommend it particularly for those who want to video-chat with their away-from-home kids. It's inexpensive enough to buy one for each."
1,Doesnt work with Flash 11,"I have had this camera a while now and was happy with it, but I have to point out that it does not work with Flash 11 or higher!It still works in MSN but no longer works in websites, I have to uninstall flash and install version 10 to get it to work.As such this isnt a product I can recommend any longer."
4,"nice product, great price","I've never used a webcam before, had no idea what to look for so I decided to try this one as the price was right and the reviews positive. I'm satisfied and would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a reasonable, easy to install, simple to use webcam with decent picture."
4,Works fine,"The picture quality seems to be very good. I can't tell for certain, since I don't know what the other end sees exactly, but they tell me it's fine. Really, these web cams have a long way to go, but from what I can tell this inexpensive camera is as good as any other."
4,A great way to stay in touch,"I have a Mac with a built in video camera. I've given this camera to three family members with PCs. We use Skype, and it works great! Any problems we've had have been because of slow processors on the computer itself, not the camera. A great gift!"
2,Dissapointed,Motion capture is very poor. If you are perfectly still in front of the camera the video is fine. Just don't move! Audio is very choppy.
4,life cam,"Great web cam for the price, built in mic, and focus ring. It will sit on flat surface or hang on a notebook screen."
4,Lifecam VX-1000,"Works well, easy setup. Good price. This is a good choice if you are look ing for a cheap web cam with good quality."
3,OK For The Price,I bought this webcam for light business use using popular IM programs like Skype and MSN. I easily downloaded the software although I found the installation time a bit too long. The camera did work right away on my VISTA operating system and I was happy to find limited icons thrown onto my desktop.I am a bit disappointed in the overall video quality and I think that is more of a reflection of my disappointment in the industry's delay in providing better processors in lower priced webcams.
4,Satisfying,"I actually like this product, the installation software was straight forward so it was very easy. The picture quality is a bit blurry and the sound quality is a bit staticy but for the money I spent I think I can deal with it."
4,"Works well, but I'd recommend the VX-3000 model","I bought this for an older laptop in our office, and since it was Windows 2000, it didn't work (my fault for not checking). Anyway, we are now using it on a XP machine, and the camera works well. It's clear and the microphone performs well. The only issue is when adjusting, it is darn-near impossible NOT to hit that button on top (which launches Windows Live messenger, which we don't use). I've seen a buncb of other people mention the same thing. We use Skype... no issues at all with it.So, all-in-all, I would have given a 4.5, which I can't, so since it isn't perfect, I'm giving it 4 stars.I also have a VX-3000 model which I would purchase over this one since it's around the same price and USB 2.0. Though, to be honest, I don't notice much difference."
4,Microsoft Lifecam VX-1000,"Very easy to install, even for beginners. The image is fine for the price and can sit on the laptop fine...doesn't exactly fit but OK."
1,Doesn't work with XP SP2,"I was simply unable to install the driver, due to Error code 1603. I then download its most recent driver from Microsoft web site ... Still no luck."
4,Great product,"Great to use the product for Skype since our grandkids are scattered from the Azore Islands, Alaska, Oregon and Montana."
2,Skip It,"I cannot recommend. I bought this and a Logitech priced twice as high to see if the additional expense was worth it. Apparently it is. The picture quality is surprisingly low, perhaps this is a function of the price point vs. the manufacturer, I cannot say. I can just say ""buy the $40 Logitech instead""."
2,Microsoft LifeCam VX-1000,"The video camera aspect of this works good in well lit areas. Low light areas things become a whole different thing. I can not comment on the sound as I could NEVER get sound to work on this. Be it on Vista 64bit or Vista 32bit. Even downloaded drivers, etc. directly from Microsoft's website. If I could have given it a negative star for sound I would have. I would also give a negative star for lack thereof support from Microsoft. This was brand new and I called the next day and they wanted me to pay for support..?..? ""Are you serious, this is brand new as of yesterday"".If you are wanting a camera for video only then this would be good/fair for the price. My built in camera on my Dell XPS laptop blows this out of the water! But if you are requiring sound - looks elsewhere..."
4,Web Cam,"Very cost effective product; once set up, works fine. Set up, however, is not straightforward, so be prepared to do what you think should be done, rather than what Microsoft's instructions say. Poor performance in low light rooms, even with adjustments."
4,Works ok...could be better quality for Skype,bought this for my 12 yo son to talk to him from across country on skype..it works ok..but I cant tell if the camera is poor quality or if its skype that could produce a better picture.
4,good basic webcam,The one thing that bothers me about these web cams is that the resolution of the web cam is 640x480 and it is specifically for the windows live messenger but when you are doing video chat in windows live messenger there is know way to increase the resolution beyond 320x240 which is really annoying since you cant make the video full screen with out it being very blurry and the frame rate is not very high either even on a fast connection with fast upload and download speeds on both ends but other then that it works alright and sets up easy
4,LifeCam,We bought this with a headset to see our son while hewas at college and away from the family. It has worked out great and was a treat to see him in his dorm room. It made it seem like we were there and it was easy to hookup for him.
3,Great camera,Great camera.Very clear picure even in minimal light.The only bad things are the microsoft software.don't need it just bothers me.That and the button on top.And the microphone is a bit too far for clear reception.
1,Microsoft Lifecam VX-1000,"I can not used because was't acepted by Microsof, they said it is not the original. Microsoft Lifecam VX-1000I am sorry, but I am not using.Sr. Myrta Iturriaga s.p."
3,NOT BAD,"Decent product, nothing too fancy, simple to install and use. For the price I would say that it was a decent deal."
2,Was hoping for better,Poor picture quality. Camera is not up to the task especially in varied lighting conditions (bright daytime sun to dim dusk to indoor lighting). The cam goes into saturation very easily in bright conditions.
4,Great Device Performance Considering its Cost!!!,"There are better microsoft models around than this one, but if you don't need an ""HD"" quality for a single webcam, this is a very great option!.Great features like micro incorporaded, ready for windows live, etc."
4,good cam...1 or 2 cons,resolution is better than average. kinda hard to manipulate without pressing the damn button on top....and doesNt quite sit on my flat panel as demonstrated in pictures
3,1 out of 3 is just usable,"I don't know if HP has a policy of letting blind people buy their parts but after getting one of these with a broken blue channel (everything was yellow), I had it replaced by another that has noticeable grey cloudiness in the blacks. When I asked for a replacement for that, they sent me an LCD that was hilariously defective, with a large dark band all the way across 1/4 of the screen. Are they getting the dregs that Apple isn't buying or something? I thought that I'd try and save a few bucks and buy this since the Apple is a bit pricey but after all this trouble and the rather cheesy clunkiness of this LCD's design, I wish I had gone with the Apple. I'll never buy another HP product again."
3,It's ok if you get one that works,"We bought 7 of these for work. Two arrived DOA with black horizontal bands (squeezing the case made them better or worse).We returned these two and a week later got two in exchange. BOTH of these replacements were also DOA with the same problem!Of the ones that worked, none would sync properly at the native resolution of 1920x1200 without LOTS of trial and error manipulation of the clock and clock phase (This is only in analog usage). Once we achieved sync, they did seem to work properly.There are some other minor quality issues, but overall the displays seem ok once working properly"
1,Terrible picture!!!,Use on eof these at work. Woudlnt buy this if it was half the price. Picture is grainy regardless of setting and case is cheap plastic. this model is without any real quality components. Avoid HP products in general. Poor workmanship!
3,Mono recording -- beware,"It's my own fault for not looking at the label and seeing this disc consists of all mono recordings, which were made in the 30's and 40's. As such the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.Maybe historical recordings are of interest to you, I don't know, but I'd rather have the crisp clear CD sound of a modern recording.Otherwise, the playing is very good."
1,a good book,"after reading this book,i got a thorough grounding in memory issues associated with embedded systems on chip"
4,Great Introductory Book.,"Automated Planning is a good book for those who get started out in the field of search and planning. It's a good overview of the topics that abound within the planning community.The only downside of the book is its dealing with important topics like planning graphs and markov description process is cursory, and more detail would have been nice."
1,Terrible Quality,One of the glass was broken. The other two had chipping. Not worth the money. Returning them. Do NOT recommend!
3,Didn't do anything for me.,"I got these after trying out some chocolate hoodia squares from GNC. They made a small difference in my appetite. They were spendy, though, so I thought I'd try these. They didn't do a thing for me. Results may vary."
1,INCREDIBLY Dissappointing!,"Being a loyal fan of the twosome, and the entire series, I thought it obvious to purchase the fourth season. It proved to be the biggest disappointment, and it did not even create enough interest for me to finish watching the entire season. A very good example of ""Car-crash Television""......"
4,Why should you watch this..!????? keep reading....,"I've seen the first 2 episodes of this show and so far it's a real surprise. I never liked Road Rules, so I went into it a little apprehensive considering the two shows share some creative blood. Plus, the girls (especially Hilton) are really fun to look at."
3,Stupidly Fun and Entertaining,"Admit it - people who watch this TV show is to watch Paris, it is just simply the fact!It is definitely not a smart TV show in terms of the contents, but we sometimes just like to watch a stupid show, why not? As long as we are just the watchers who can have a great laugh, rather than the actors who have line of problems due to behaving dumb!"
1,just wait till next season.,"the 4th season is a complete disappointment. but, wait till next season. when paris is sentanced to 45 days in jail, she turns to her lawyer and asks, 'is that a place that sells ale ??' then we get episodes of 45 days and nights in a california 'spa cupcake' with color tv, air conditioning, low-fat no added salt chicken diet, paris drinking her first cup of jail brewed 'buck', and nicole visiting. then again, the judge should have sent paris to the arizona maricopa county tent jail. the episodes of paris working different jobs on the 'chain-gang' would be much more entertaining, especially with nicole crusing by in a limo."
3,Not as good as the others =\,This season was not as good as the others becuase they clearly tour apart. Yes they still do make fools of themselves but its not as funny without the both of them. The show went down hill becuase they werent together. Not there jsuty bitchy to each other. The show was great when they wree together. I think they should go back to each other. It was greater that way.
1,anyone who watches this is an idiot,I weep for our nation. Anyone who watches this should be ashamed of themself. You are directly at fault for the decline of western civilization.
4,Simple Life Huge Supporter,I am huge fan of SIMPLE LIFE. I will have to say they make idiots of themselves and make you laugh! This season is not as funny since they are not working together. When they work together they feed off of each other humor and stupidity.......Some of the smallest tasks they are given they turn into the biggest things. Then there are others that I would never have thought of adapting to. I will still add SIMPLE LIFE Season 4 to the collection of 1-3. These are things you can watch over and over and laugh as if you have never seen them before!!! Nicole needs her own TV show!!!!!
5,AWESOME ! THESE GIRLS RULE!,"Paris and Nicole are separate in this season, however the show is great and much FUN. The way it is produced and edited is the success formula of this hillarious and non-stop fun Reality Show! If you liked the previous seasons, you will love this one!"
3,Just not the same,"First three seasons are just too funny! This season leaves something to be desired. Since Paris and Nicole are feuding during this timeframe, it's just not the same. Still a few laughs."
1,Buyer beware! Not classic Magoo,"I purchased this item at a retail outlet, and was dismayed to find upon playing it that it is several episodes of a dismal 1977 TV series. Unless the buyer is familiar with the series title ""What's New, Mr. Magoo,"" one would have no idea that it was part of that lame effort -- there is no indication on the package that this was made for TV. The 1977 copyright date is the only clue. Don't waste your money on this!"
5,Mark Tabb the Ozian expert,"I was first caught by the cover and title. A great concept. Then when I opened the book I was blown away. Mark Tabb has nailed it down. Many Christians don't know how to talk to the Natives of Oz in their language and so they can't lead the ""Ozians"" to the Great Physician of their soul. Mark Tabb clearly explains the postmodern mindset and gives practical advice on how to connect. The only shortcomming I can note is that some readers may think this book is only for those who communicate with teens or college-aged people. Not true. The residents of Oz cover multiple generations. If you are interested in making a difference in Oz then I highly recommend reading ""Mission to Oz"". Comming in at just a bit short of 150 pages, it's not a big time commitment."
5,Big band is alive and well!,This is a great CD for any one who likes their big bands to play their music from the heart. The section playing is superb and the soloing is terrific. A real find!
5,This book is awesome.,"I cannot believe that the reviews for this book are not amazing. This book winds together beautifully. It's great for teenagers, managing to be remarkably true to life, as as well as interesting and unique.I loved it."
1,boring,"when i picked up this book i thought it was rather interesting from what i read in the synopsis on the back. but when i started reading it, i wanted to hit something with this book, its so incredibly boring, the main character overthinks things and i feel it has no life, but hey, if you want to read it, go ahead, maybe someday ill finish reading this book."
4,Excellent Learning Tool for Struggling Readers,This fun Rebus book comes complete with flash cards in the back to help your student learn new vocabulary. My daughter struggles with reading and she enjoyed working with this form of book. It is a popular character - Scooby-Doo in a Rebus form that allows the beginning reader to succeed at reading. I would like to have more of the same.
5,Great Metal From France!!!,"This is second album from this great band!Killer songs!!!Killer vocals!!!Buy now,you won't be sorry!!!"
4,"Get In the Christmas Spirit, Beautiful for Gift Giving",This is a beautiful book. I read it to keep the Christmas spirit about me while bustling about getting Christmas ready. I liked The First Christmas Tree story but I loved the story of The Christmas Angel and the Spirit of Christmas with the Christmas Prayers at the back.
4,Historically significant,"Great insight into how the most important document of our government and society was written. Presents to issues, compromises and perspectives of some of the greatest thinkers on social policy, human rights and how to build a Republic."
3,Ha!,I bought this game 2 days before it was released back in the day for a whopping $80!!! Now you can get it used for 44 cents....oh my! That's why I'm skipping this new generation of consoles entirely.I still get great joy from the xbox 1 and I do have a psp which is great for the nostalgic games that I loved growing up as a kid on the go...
2,At first it was ok.. but..,"I was a bit surprised with the size, but I didn't mind.The numbers were a bit harder to read, but I got used to it.However, after using the watch for a few months, I went on a vacationto California. It was about 100 F~degrees or over, and theresin portion of the watch - especially at the sides surroundingthe buttons - were melting, and bending.. and the watch was alwayson my wrist - I didn't put it directly in the sun or anything, justnormal wear. After a while, the silver paint on the resin started topeal, and so I was able to wear this watch for about a year in total.Maybe my case may have been a rare mishap, but I wanted tolet you know before you invest money on this watch."
5,"A spicy, seductive romance story that I could not put down!","I really enjoyed this book! HOT, HOT, HOT romance!! I love a well-written spicy romance novel that focuses on falling in love, and of course, has a bit of fooling around. This book has plenty of sexual tension and fooling around, in fact it borders on being erotica. I loved Suzanne and Jax's story, and found myself skimming through some of the love making scenes just to see where the story would go. I could not put this book down! I will buy more from this author."
5,Hot Book with Heart!,"I am not usually a huge fan of erotic romances, with the books of Emma Holly being a notable exception. I've *liked* a lot of the erotic romances I've read, but I've rarely *loved* them. Champagne Rules fits neatly into the latter category.As you would expect in an erotic romance, there's lots of hot sex, and it's all very well written. The reader gets to see the characters' thoughts and emotions, which makes the sex scenes much more powerful. And I love the irony that both the hero and the heroine think of themselves as ""boring"" outside of their steamy affair. We get to watch their emotional growth throughout the course of the book, and that's the best part. I will definitely be reading more by Susan Lyons!"
3,classic early John Lee Hooker 5 stars rating!,"This record came to my attention via The Penguin Guide To Blues Records.It is a true gem for the serious collector of John Lee Hooker,since it contains alternate versions of masterpieces recorded early in the Detroit days.Whole-heartedly recommended!No matter what the legends say - I am not sure how only three stars turned up - but my rating is five stars."
5,SO CUTE,bought as a gift for my daughter who started collecting the mini flopsies. she loves them and they are so soft.
2,Doesn't have a 110-V plug to get maximum pumping,I returned this compressor because I needed one to pump up the tires of a big Ford 310 pickup truck. This compressor just wouldn't do it!
4,Great,"It wasn't as good as Night of Abandon, which I think is the best of the Red Shoe Diaries series, it was great nevertheless. However, I just have one comment about the product. What's up with the price? I was browsing this site and was about to buy it, then I check it and couldn't believe my eyes; 105 dollars for a used copy and 179 for a new one, that's more money than the entire Band of Brothers collection. I had a quick change of thought. I think that those sellers are to reconsider."
4,Fabric lighter weight than I thought it would be,"""12 oz."" fabric, so I guess I should look that part up next time before ordering. My bad. As with the other reviewers, I was disappointed with the thin, unpadded shoulder strap; would augment if carrying heavier load.I could have done without the ""shell loops"" - may seam-rip them out eventually.Lots of threads ends needed to be trimmed."
4,A four-star bag,"$18.95 from Bigflysports, it's a Rothco bag so everbody should be getting the same thing. I have very little complaints, it's maybe an inch or two smaller than I thought it would be, but I'm 6'3"". I was worried about the strap not being long enough, but it rides perfectly well on my hip when all the way out. Some of the stitching could be better, and there is extra metal on the snaps in the front that makes them hard to close and open. Overall a great bag."
5,Stellar,"This is a stellar product. Many of my friends have bags that just dont cut it so I purchased this one and it has been great. Everything is heavy duty about it while still have a clean stylish look. Plenty of room for binder, laptop, and notebooks."
2,"Functional but doesn't hold shape, floppy with insubstantial strap","I carried this for a year and then replaced it with the Banana Republic messenger bag that was constructed out of heavier synthetic canvas which helps the bag retain shape. This bag while in the picture has the shape of a messenger bag goes absolutely limp while carrying it and ends up looking like a cheapo hippy purse. I wanted to love my jack sack but it never looked like the one featured on the Jack Bauer Hour of Power. I'm much happier with my messenger bag from BR which is both water resistant, keeps it shape, and has nifty leather accents. Sorry Rothco I can't recommend this bag."
3,Not so much!,I didn't like the bag very much; too big and has no support to put in a laptop or a book. Would be a great bag for travelers though!!
2,Buyer Beware,"Despite all of these bags being offered under the same product link, there are many variations depending on which style you buy. I purchased the Israeli paratrooper (Olive) bag and what I got was nothing like the description.NO side pocketsNO internal pocketsNO zippers/velcro etc.Just one front pocket and 3 internal compartments - also while the material is obviously durable, was somewhat disappointed in how shapeless the bag is (ends up just looking kind of like an oversized lumpy purse). As another reviewer noted, it is very easy to pick the bag up by the strap and have the whole thing empty its contents.Returning for refund, and will probably consider other vendors."
4,Classic Paratrooper Shoulder Bag,"Good bag, I thought it was a little bigger, but it worked out great."
2,Not what i expected,"I was looking forward to this bag, just to carry small things like my camera and papers around town. What I got was a very large disappointment. I ordered the olive paratrooper bag, hoping that what I would get would be very sturdy, stylish, and useful.Instead, this bag looks like none of those things. While the strap might hold up, looking at the bag itself, I get the impression that it would not survive as well as I had hoped. The strap also isn't long enough. Finally - and this is more personal than anything - I hate it when I don't get something exactly as I saw in the picture. I got the impression that the paratrooper emblem would stand out or was even a metal pin; instead, it is an unimpressive iron-on patch, giving the entire thing a very immature look."
2,Not for people with pets...,"I purchased this bag with the intention of carting all the usual girly ""necessities"" (lotion, makeup, cellphone, checkbook/change-purse etc) as well as daily lunches to and from work. It arrived promptly in perfect condition, but within the first day's use I found that it seemed to attract hair and lint like some sort of super-magnet. In fact, I'd only had it for 2 weeks until I broke down and purchased a new bag elsewhere. It was an ""ok"" bag for the price - good size, nice compartments, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with pets. It's a nightmare to clean and almost impossible to control the fuzz content it seems to so readily adorn itself with. The fact that it's black only aids in exacerbating the problem. Using a lint roller three plus times daily on a bag of this quality/price simply wasn't worth the hassle."
2,You can lose your items put into this bag,"I like military look. So, at first I liked this bag. However, it turned out that the flip-cover stayed there firmly. When you quickly grab the bag, it can be upside down, then everything inside is fallen down.I lost 1 USB memory and 1 iPod shuffle which I kept in this bag.If you use this bag as a notebook bag, consider buying a sleeve,because this doesn't absorb shock."
3,Size not as expected,Product is exactly as pictured but much bigger than I expected. No fault of the vendor who performed beautifully. Couldn't ask for better service or quality of product. I've done a little Christmas shopping early as I will give it as a gift.Ralph Dyer
2,not so great,"I bought this bag as a replacement for one that was stolen, and was hoping it would be similar because it's the same price. It doesn't have as many pockets, and the canvas is not as ridged so it feels floppy when you're trying to get into it. Also, the stitching that holds the strap on started coming undone after a few days. It looks pretty cool though, and the pen holders in the front flap is a good feature, which earned this bag one more star. On the whole though, I would recommend a different bag, like the heavyweight classic messenger bag. It's sturdier and a better design for organization."
3,"Cool bag, but not for school","This is a very cool bag, but not appropriate for middle or high schoolers, because it doesn't really hold all the stuff they need to lug around. Well made and hip looking. We'll save it for other uses."
3,"good bag, but fades with sunlight","I bought this bag less than a year ago in the OLIVE color. It's a great bag for a college student who doesn't need to carry a lot of things across campus. I can only complain about two problems with this bag: 1. Parts of the bag have faded/changed color due to exposure to the sunlight 2. The strap adjuster slips, so the bag won't stay a certain length for a long time.Overall, it's a great bag, and I would definately buy another one once this one gets older."
5,A good knock around bag,"This bag has a good amount of room. Made of heavy cotton, metal harware. Inside pocket, snap shut outside pockets and 2 zip shut pockets under the flap. Good price."
3,Sturdy comfortable bag,"Have owned and used this bag daily for around 6 months or so. Best feature: NEVER SLIPS OFF MY SHOULDER. I would infuse this material into every purse strap I own. Love it. I don't really like wearing it across my body so this is a definate 4 star feature to me. Nothing worse than a purse slipping off your shoulder. Pleanty of room however It's hard to get into. I find myself often searching blindly trying to find what I need. Compartments are too loose and weird. Pocket in front is hard to snap and open and the things on the front of that pocket, for bullits or what?!? Are good for pens and such but pretty much a wasted mess. Would like to find one with the same great strap material with better inside construction."
1,Ripped after a week,My mum bought me this bag and I loved it. It was really cool and I had no problems with carrying it. It wasn't bulky or uncomfortable. After I had it a week with two text books and a reading book inside the entire side ripped open. It's a good bag but it can't handle anything more than a single laptop. It's very cheaply made. I loved it but it isn't worth anything if you can't put anything inside it without it ripping open.
5,Great product!,This is just what I was looking for. I was in need of a bag to sling across my back as I ride to the mailbox. This is big enough to even hold the Sunday paper. It has 2 large compartments and several pockets. The canvas is thick yet soft. The stitching is durable. I would recommend this product.
4,Pretty nice bag...only one real complaint.,"I just got my bag today. It's large enough to carry my books for college and also seems like it will be pretty sturdy. However, the strap is very short/small. I wish it was a bit longer and wider. If you're very tall, this will be more like a purse than a messenger bag. Other than that, good bag!"
2,waste of money,I bought this bag because i needed something to carry around some important papers in. I read the reviews but I thought hey I don't need it to be super strong just do the job a bag supposed to do like i don't know carry things. This thing doesn't even have a stiffener in it so it curves around my leg while walking and ruins whatever folders i have in there. The only thing stopping me from returning it is that i think it will make a decent makeup bag. What does it take to find a decent good looking messenger bag that doesn't cost $50 bucks?
2,It's okay...,"Bag has nice, soft, cotton texture but very light. Strap is way too short for anyone over 5 feet tall. Can't sling across chest or else it feels like its stuck up in your armpit. Good size, keeps my books and pens well. Hope it lasts for at least 1 semester.Manufacturer's suggestion box: use more material for the strap; at least 40"" would do and at least 1.5"" width for comfort."
2,smaller then it looks,"its a good bag but its smaller than it looks,the strap is really thin and short. the bag size is decent but with the short/thin strap it makes it harder to use,.if you're under the age of 13 ,ten its awesome"
5,It fits my 32oz Nalgene!,"This item is great. I received this item promptly (within 3 days of ordering it on standard shipping). It came in a regular sized USPS package slip (~9x12), and I initially thought the bag was going to be too small. When opening it, I realized it was just folded and efficiently packed. After that, awesomeness ensued...It meets my every need. The material is thick and well stitched so it seems that the product will last beyond my death. I got lucky and received a bag with a zipper for the main compartment. My 14 inch laptop fits well inside. The two smaller compartments are also zippered. There's also a second zippered area within the main compartment and a third velcro pouch externally at the rear. The best part - each of the two buttoned water holders laterally placed fit my 32 oz Nalgene snuggly! I drink lots of water, so my magmatic dreams have come true! I am one happy creature."
1,"Beware!! Not what it ""seams' to be.........","Thought I was getting an army surplus grade paratrooper bag, but material is very thin and flimsy like a dish towel,not heavy duty canvas, too afraid to put more than a cell phone and wallet in it or it may rip apart, the strap is as others have mentioned very short and is made from same flimsy fabric, the hardware is also on the cheaper/breakable side so would not hold up as a school book bag or laptop carrier, the straps rings could easily bend or snap open if weight is too much,color is not khaki as shown but more olive drab, am returning it for these reasons, seller needs to show photo of actual item and not a stock shot and describe fabric honestly."
4,Good bag,Just good bag. Not the one that is in other reviews..It is just cheaper copy. For example there is no zippers and only one main pocket. There are also no places for pen/pencils. Still the bag looks great and suits good!
5,"Sturdy, and looks good too.","I use this bag for school to carry my books, or when I go to the shooting range, and any time I take the train into NYC. Its easy to use because unlike a backpack I dont need to take it off to go through it, I can get something from it while its on me. Its tough as nails, very sturdy construction, it also looks pretty cool as well. (especially if youre a 24 fan and always wished you could have Jack's ""magic bag"" from season 5, sorry no Glocks, endless ammo supply, lock picking kit, knife set, flashlights, PDAs, or lighters included.) Only downside is if you have to carry a heavy load with it, there is no padding on the strap, but I rarely do, so it works well."
2,Sides Ripped,I had this bag for about a month when the side ripped. Would not buy again. I would probably have to replace the second one too.
4,buy it,"this is a good bag, i loved mine. it is somewhat roomy, i could fit a couple of textbooks in it and two notebooks without it looking stupid. my only problem with it is its very boring looking, i had to get some puff paint to decorate it. i would not recomend it for a highschool student."
4,"Cheap, Durable, and Comfortable","I don't know how those three things can even be in the same sentence, but it's true. Great as a laptop bag, perfect fit for my 15.1"". I use it to carry my laptop, peripherals, utensils, notebooks, and my lunch. It all its just fine, and doesn't hurt my shoulder or anything. There's also 3 compartments to sort in. be careful, though, because they're not sewn separate. At the bottom of all three compartments there's a small opening that connects all three, like a slit. It's a good thing, though, it helps the bag keep its form.It's a fantastic bag for the price. If you're on the fence, just buy it."
4,Great!!,I searched for the right bag and when I came across this bag I desided to get it. The shipping was fast and on time. The bag is good quality. If your looking for a nice bag I recommend this bag.
5,Perfect for the Price,"There is a difference between Ace Mart Stores and Gravity Trading, see the customer images as well as one of the reviews for a comparison of the two bags. I ended up getting the 9118 BLACK HW CLASSIC MESSENGER BAG. Some things you might want to know: it doesn't hold its shape well, the velcro isn't that strong, it attracts lint, and it fades relatively quickly. As for me, that is actually what I was looking for."
4,Good cheap bag,"I am pleased with this bag, it's cheap, durable, and well made. Plenty of room inside, and the inside zippered pocket is handy for smaller things.There does seem to some issue with which bag you will get from the supplier (Gravity Trader). In the user pictures there appears to be two different bags. One has a zipper for the main compartment and the other does not. The bag I received last month is the latter. It does not have a zipper for the main compartment. Something I would have liked but was unsure of between the reviews and pictures. Not a big deal, but I also find that the velcro on the flap doesn't have a strong grip. Not an issue unless for some reason the bag got tipped upside down.Still, very happy with the bag for the price."
2,Bad.,"Bought this for on the go and emergencies. The strap is too short, and I'm only 5'4"". It barely reaches my waist, so I can't put this on and have it slung on the opposite side of my shoulder. There is no padding on straps, so it is painful to have it for long periods of time. The compartments are helpful, but since it is not sewn to the bottom, some of your stuff could get into other compartments.A bit crude for the price and a huge rip off."
2,Did not hold up well,"I really liked this bag when I first received it. It is made of heavy weight material and stitching and it is designed well. However, very quickly some of the threads started coming loose and the inside pocket zipper broke. It has also become very faded and is starting to become a mustard-yellow color in areas that have been exposed to the sun. I'm going to try re-dying it, but next time I won't purchase from this company."
3,At least good for one semester!,"Bought this bag not knowing quality....it is a little thin. I never fully loaded it for fear of it ripping, but it did its job. I still have and use it, it made its way through one semester, and probably another. Just a little thin to LOAD FULLY WITH BOOKS on a daily basis."
3,good for everything excep to carry a laptop in it,"all i have to say is , don't buy this bag if your looking to put your laptop inside. Because there is no support or any protection for the laptop. This is the only downside.i'm happy with the bag , but i was disappointed about the laptop thing"
3,disappointed about the narration,"A wonderful production, I have no complain about that. However, my disappointment came from the narration part. The original one was done by late great Kyoko Kishida, who was the actress did ""Woman in the Dune"", and her mysterious voice should have been so suitable for this kind of story, yet it was replaced with an English narration by some unknown actress. I do not say that English narration is bad, but at least we should be given a choice for the original Japanese one or the English one. And strangely enough all other dialogues are subtitled and there is no choice to turn off that either. On the back of the case, it is said that the subtitle is optional, but it is not true. I do not know why Kino Video did this way. If they wanted to overdub this, they should have done the entire thing, and then given us a choice. This is so stupid and disapponting to me although I still recommend this beautiful animation."
1,too loose to give a good display,"This was too loose, and the only way to keep it working was to hold it against the computer's DVI port and then hook up the HDMI. I might have gotten a bad one from a line of good products, but I have no way of testing one that works."
4,"Great record, crappy CD package","Come on Taang! Don't you think it's time to remaster and repackage Poison Idea's catalog? I had this on vinyl since it came out but it's trashed so decided to pick up the CD. Great music but horrible mastering job and crappy booklet. Poison Idea deserve much better than this. God bless Pig Champion, RIP.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City"
5,"Second only to ""Pick Your King""","I second the remarks of the venerable Chris BCT--this is second only to ""Pick Your King"", simply because PYK is so short and fast that there are no spaces between the songs (on the vinyl copy anyway). To his classic lineup of the first three releases, I would only add ""War All the Time,"" which also stands up nicely.I was fortunate enough to see PI a couple times on their 1990 East Coast tour, and they were billiant. Still got my ""World's Loudest Drunks"" t-shirt."
3,Just another above average book of marketing,"Although I do appreciate the effort of the authors to offer a structured and systematic means ""for finding breakthrough ideas"" by incorporating de Bono's lateral thinking concept into the marketing management arena, I can hardly agree that they are ""new techniques"" at all. This can be a good textbook for undergrads, but far from satisfying veteran marketers who fought hard daily on the front line for new means to satisfy the ever increasingly demanding customers, or readers who had finished more than five marketing books, probably with over half of them by Kotler himself.Instead of buying this book, I strongly suggest you to read the review by Donald Mitchell who had written a very good summary of it. Perhaps you can simply read de Bono's Lateral Thinking, a move that will give you higher returns on both time and book cost."
5,The End of the Road to Hell...,"In this final volume of the now-legendary series, Lone Wolf and Cub face their final battle against their enemy, Lord Restudo in a showdown that is nothing less than poetic and stunning. Being a reader of the series since it started being published in the U.S. (going on two years now...), the final shocking act committed in this series definitely struck a chord with me. A long journey has ended, and with it, a truly great epic series (sure to be among the finest in comic history or popular literature) has as well. Highly Recommended."
4,Not your average road movie!,"""Give Me Your Hand"" (aka ""Donnes-moi la main"")is an unusual road movie about a pair of twins, Antoine and Quentin, making their way across France and Spain to attend their mother's funeral, walking, hitchhiking, jumping trains. A smoldering rivalry between the brothers eventually erupts into jealousy, resentment, anger and violence.The film moves rather slowly, even though it is just over 75 minutes long. There is very little dialogue. Most of the thoughts and feelings of the brothers is communicated through their looks and gestures and actions. The actors playing the twins (Alexandre and Victor Carril) give fine performances. The film is visually stunning, capturing the beauty of the French and Spanish countryside.Definitely not to everyone's taste, but it is a moving portrait of the uneasy relationship that often exists between siblings."
3,average,i bought this film because it was recomended as a gay film. one scene does not a gay film make. mostly i found it boring
1,Too hard to set,I found the watch to difficult to set so I sent both watches back.I give the watch 1 star for looks.
5,Fun story about buffalo with positive messages for children.,"My five year old nephew listened attentively while I read him this story. When asked how he liked it, he played it out in detail using sofas as rail cars, pogo stick horses, ramps for buffalo loading, and pillows linking ""rail car sofas"" together. His father became the train engineer. The Runt tells about a clash of cultures, set in frontier America. Buffalo and towns people are on a collision course until a kind railroad engineer steps up with a solution -- ship the buffalo to Montana. In the ensuing round-up our young hero is left behind and must use his survival skills to rejoin his family. The tale is told with urbane wit and a fine-tuned sensibility. Suitable for all ages."
4,Religion??!!?,"It is widely known that man was God's best creation and when man goes in search of their ""own"" Gods, all hell breaks loose. What an irony!It makes the reader wonder whether the people of the yesteryears were so out of work, that they actually had the time and nerve to battle over a mosque that was built upon a temple ages back.As for the style of writing, it is true that the author has put in too much of historical data. It was more like reading a book on the history of India... It would have been a lot better if the chronological actions were all removed and instead, replaced with more elaboration on the individual and human aspect of the characters."
1,A big upset,"lajja was a major disappointment in that it simply chronicled the events happening between 1990 and 1995 . I believe that the author lacks a basic story telling skill. She attempts to tell a tale about the 1990 riots through the experiences of a familly , but it feels like continously reading the day to day newpaper of that time.I felt cheated after reading the same."
5,"User error, sorry, don't you make the same mistake...","Bought this adaptor, and it plain does not work. I thought it funny that they make a conversion box to go from DVI to VGA and yet they also sell a simple adaptor, no sure how others got this to work.Product came in 1 day and was as described.Update:I figured it out. See this website ([...]), it explains it all, it is my user error. I have a DVI-D (D for digital) connection to my monitor, so I need a conversion box to go to VGA (VGA is analog signal). You have to have a DVI-A or DVI-I connection to not need a conversion box."
4,Useful Adapter,"This is a useful adapter. No problem making attachments, Solid build, good delivery time, good purchase. Will come in handy when needed."
4,Overall great! One annoying glitch!,"I have had this for about a half a year now and I love it. I love the sound quality, the ease with the remote and the sturdiness of it. The one annoying glitch is this: If I listen to a CD while I'm falling asleep, the machine does not rest quietly when it is done playing. It almost sounds like the speaker shorts out until I turn the thing off or begin the CD again. All in all, though, it is a good machine."
1,Dismayed-Disgusted-Disappointed,"The manufacturer's statement ""Experience concert-like effects anywhere you go with the Panasonic RX-D27"" couldn't be farther from the truth. The equalizer has four settings, but neither has good quality. There is absolutely no way to experience good rich sound from this product. I had a cheaper Phillips box that was much better. In addition, the design is not very pleasing to the eye. It looks like a blob of something sitting there. Don't buy this thing. I know what I'm talking about.P.T. Geveden"
1,"Terrible Biographical DVD. Sorry, but it is awful.","Here are the virtues that I see in this DVD: there are a few interesting comments made by a very few reminiscing friends and associates. There are a very few scenes with the Peppers speaking.Now here are the slams:1. There is random, not Peppers music playing throughout the DVD. Is it Creed? Bad idea.2. As the commentary talks about the old times in the band, you see imagery of Dave Navarro and later Chili Peppers clips. There is a section that discusses John Frusciante in the band and who do they show images of? Dave Navarro. Nice3. There are several annoying clips that show Anthony speaking in slow motion, muted.4. There is about one sentence discussing the success of Blood Sugar Sex Magic.5. The DVD is filled with stock video clips as opposed to clips of substance.I don't like to diss but this DVD sucks. If you are a die-hard fan then check it out. No don't. It sucks. It is a problematic production. See for yourself if you insist."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY,"This ""documentary"" is plain garbage. It is worthless and you are WAY better of buying ""Funky Monks"" or some official documentary. Like prior people have reviewed, Anthony, Flea, & Chad have a combined at least 5 minutes. That's it. No interviews with anyone else, not even John!. It is pure S***. They mainly interview 3 people the entire time. There isn't even MUSIC by them in here. It's some really crappy background band. It sucks, DO NOT waste your time or money, trust me. I'm a HUGE RHCP fan, and this does nothing to honor them."
1,Death to my eyes on the road,"Theoretically, Steve Harris was the one to take more care than anyone elese when giving birth to his new ""baby"": the DVD Death On The Road"". This show comes in gorgeous packaging, and contains a very interesting bonus DVD.However, when it comes to its main attraction (the show DVD), it's a complete digrace. Bad edition destroyed the live footage, to the point of getting numb while watching it, scratching your eyes trying do adjust to something incredibly bad taste, like it's the case with the edition of this show... Blinding-fast, where you can not watch any single band member, you can't enjoy the show. I just don't get it. Go figure what Harris was thinking..."
2,The Editing makes it Unwatchable,"After the Rock In Rio fiasco, I couldnt believe this one was chopped up even worse. For the love of God Steve, stay on the guitar player through his whole solo, or meaningful part during a song, the endless Bruce Dickinson shots waving his arms, while Dave Murray is ripping off camera are obnoxious. I love Steve Harris and I cant stand the video editing.The perfomances speak for themselves, save money or something, leave about 20 of those cameramen off the next one."
3,"product good, though mailing bad","got the product, it was received in the alotted time. the only problem that i had w/ it was the mail. when i first opened the package, found that the case had broken. then after a few times opening and closing the case, the inside of the cd started to break. cd is good. package that was sent via the mail was not."
1,Unwatchable and barely listenable,"Sorry - there is no forgiving the editing of this DVD. It is in a word infuriating. There is no way to connect with the living, performing musicians on stage ""captured"" (presumably) by the cameras. The editing is an object lesson in how to wreck performance footage. I find it hard to believe that the creative forces behind Iron Maiden talked themselves into this massacre of the footage.Add to that (or subtract rather) that the sound is thin and I guarantee I will never watch it again. I didn't even make it thru once. This product should be taken off the market and redone. Period."
1,Edit of Death,"I love Iron Maiden but I only lasted 12 minutes with this DVD and had to turn it off. It was making me physically uncomfortable due to the dreadfully fast scene changes. I tried saying ""one million"" during each scene and hardly ever was able to finish saying it before the scene changed. Only once did I ever make it to ""two million"", sometimes I only got to ""one"" before it changes, which is about a quarter of a second. The band sounded great and I'll probably put it on again without turning on the TV and just use it as a live CD. As a DVD it is truly awful. I agree with G. Parnell, they should re-release this as a concert instead of one enormous ADD Music video. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of us are NOT suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder. I would have much preferred 1 camera as opposed to the 500 they used. Iron Maiden doesn't need gimmicks to make their concerts interesting."
1,Gave me a seizure...,"Thanks 'Arry. Thanks for ruining another great concert that we all wanted to watch.One thing though: The packaging of this DVD is a gorgeous looking brownish-red box with 3 discs, 2 of them being THE EXACT SAME CONCERT, just one is Stereo and one is 5.1...The editing of this DVD gave me a headache, there are about what, 5000 cameras jumping all over the place. This is basically just Rock in Rio editing, just faster. The editing is so fast that you can hardly keep up with what is going on! First we see the crowd for 1 second... then we go to Bruce... Then half a second later is Steve then Nicko... WTF. I had to turn the TV off and use this as a live album halfway through. Yes, Rock in Rio had fast editing, but at least you didn't notice it after a while, and at least it didn't give you a headache.The extras are nice, but the concert? Just get the CD instead."
1,Atrocious edition,"Whoever edited this thing (Mr. Harris, of course...) probably tought that the edition board's knobs were a keyboard, and started playing it with energy and speed! Whoa! The whole thing is a mess, where you cannot focus your attention in a single scene for more than a second. Just unexcusable."
2,Bad Sound and Edit.,"Hi,First of all, I love this band , and think it is one of the hardest working Rock Band.I bought it last month here in Brazil. The DVD was oficialy released here in Brazil as a 3 disc NTSC edition.The first thing a noticed is that there are two concert discs, one for 5.1 and the other for stereo. It's strange, i do not know why they did this way. Two disc for sound options only?? Strange!!I do not understand how the sound could be so bad. I think a lot of money was spent to make this DVD, but the sound is thin, with no BASS, and no punch. The 2 chanel version is a litle better.The Edit - It is very hard to watch the entire show with this fast editing. The edit is too fast, much faster than the Rock in Rio DVD. I just could not watch this show, IHO.They should re-edit the video, and re-mix the audio, and give it free to people who bought it.The Rock in Rio is a much better DVD. T Buy it instead.Antonio Souza"
1,Why do the US fans get screwed?,"This was released in the UK. What is the problem here in the US? This is well overdue. As usual, fans in the US get screwed again. >:("
2,SEE NO EVIL HERE NO EVIL,"I can not believe that this has happened again,It reminds me of baseball cards in the 80's.Are they trying to let someone grab a few copies to sale on EBAY to make money.This is a total sign of deliberate B.S.as for my part they can keep their death on the road dvd,I doughT it was that great anyway.A disgrunted maiden fan.But i love the early years and visions of the beast.And the tears of a dragon song."
5,christmas gift,product arrived fast . packaged properly.wasnt banging around in case.i know my husband will love this gift. will buy again if need be.
3,"Thanks for another live DVD, but...","I appreciate that Iron Maiden caters to its fans by releasing many live DVD's of their shows. However, Dance of Death is a pretty weak Maiden album, the title track is a recycled ""Number of the Beast"". The exception is ""Paschendale"" which is a solid song. Maiden always insists on playing too many songs from their new album, and not enough songs from their old albums. Metallica gets it, Maiden does not. Some people have critiqued this DVD for its editing - noted, but I think the sound and picture quality is done well. Bruce's theatrics and costumes liven up the show. The hard part with current Iron Maiden DVD's is always the antics of Janick Gers - this guy is a clown that just does not fit in with the mold of the band. His constant guitar swinging, playing from his hip, and erratic style and butchering of old Maiden songs is reprehensible. Overall, the DVD is worth checking out."
3,"Great ideas, writing lacks.","This book deserves a much more favorable review than 3 stars. Someone recommended it to me when I said that a meditation he taught me is the most helpful of any so far. Turns out it comes from this book. The book gets 5 stars for having a number of great meditations, which, as my friend suggested, I could record and listen to on my MP3 player.I'm just disappointed because the author does little serious explanation of how often, why, how long and so on that I should meditate. There is some discussion -- but it is in flowery, 1970's, New Age speak, not in any sort of a helpful tone.If you're looking for some excellent guided meditations, and you don't mind making youy own recordings, try this book. Otherwise, try another book."
3,Irony,I thought this book had very good and thorough information. The irony was that I actually went out on a date with this author many years ago. I got hit in the face when he picked a fight with the man sitting in front of us who has asked that Bernie please stop talking so loud. It's ironic that someone who wrote so many books on inner peace had none himself.
1,Picture does not go with actual Product,"I was looking for this kind of bucket for my Dad and ordered it from the website. I received a music CD. I returned the CD for a refund. Found the bucket with another vendor on a different website after trying to query Amazon for the correct product. Be careful in what you order, because what you see is not what you get. The product description is for a 12 Qt bucket, the actual product is actually a music CD"
3,Not a legitimate DVD.,Got this movie and it appeared to be a knock-off kind of. I tried watching it on my surround sound system but it would only play out of one set of speakers because the movie's audio wasn't recorded correctly. Wish I never bought it.
3,Direct to video with the lovely Sara Rue,I had to give this film at least three stars for the presence of the lovely Sara Rue as a blonde. I can't really comment much on the film itself as it seems to be a direct to video release. Even Sara Rue commented on Twitter that she herself was wondering whatever had become of the film. The basic premise/plot concerns a priest being duped into financing an adult film. Not certain if this will be everyone's cup of tea but as a huge fan of Sara Rue I already have this on pre-order.
3,Alright but doesn't develop a lot.,While this is an average wolverine story it doesn't add to much to his character besides developing his relationship with the agent. Good artwork really helps this one out but doesn't help with the lack of forward momentum.
5,One of the best / Needs re-release,One of the best examples of 70's jazz/rock fused together. Crackers and Streetwalker cuts alone worth the price of admission. Anyone got this available on CD I'd be interested.
2,German Army NoteBook!,"To short in many points.Mr Lucas should have left to other the review of the small arms and tanks (there is so many anyway).The Doctrine of the Nazi party is not inlight by a german vision of the ""Volks"" (people) of the time, but by a analysis of a contemporaty Britannic Vision.I could sound desapointed or even more betray by the title of this book, because I've read and I owned many military books of the subject (Wehrmacht und Heer und Waffen SS Deutsh Armee)I did'nt expect to see author writing truncated version of Order of Battles that much.The book is intended to neophyte of the World War II period. Serious reader and poeple seaching for details aspect of the German Army should look somewhere else, like for Order of Battles it would be the much sought-after series of Goerges F. Nafziger, or for Small Arms and Tanks the Arms & Armour series and for Campains the Opsrey SeriesPaul Bougault2Lt/Fus MR21/34thCBG/RCAC"
4,Very helpfull,The instructions given by the master are very good and easy to follow. Can't wait to move on from the warmup.
1,Frustrating,"After the excellent included warm up, I cant complete the first of 8 moves despite the countless times the instructor repeats it, plus by rewinding. His demonstrations face you and though he moves incredibly slow, you must do the reverse of what he shows you including pivots and it results in a different final position than what he finishes with. A camera view from behind the instructor, or even above the instructor looking down, would make much clearer the degree of the pivots and the corresponding body movements. In the past, I followed an instructor from the behind view and students were much more confident that the moves were being followed correctly."
4,good workout,follow up for the first one take steps to watchall three of the tai chi series they are worth it
3,it is okay,I found it a little too repetitive on each movement. Actually kind of frustrating. I have taken some Tai Chi before -- years ago -- and it moved at a better pace for me.
4,New To Tai Chi,Being new to Tai Chi I wanted to try one of the Video. The pace is very good he goes over the movements a few things and also explains common issue people have . I would recommend this to anyone this to anyone who wants to try Tai Chi
5,Bodywisdom tai chi for begiiners,it is a great dvd of tai chi for people who do not know anything about tai chi.I really like.it teachs me a lot.thanks for this dvd.
5,Great for the beginner!,"I had no experience with any form of Tai Chi. Tried taking a class, but in my one and only session, I couldn't coordinate the moves that were required of the arms, legs, hands all at the same time. Realized that I needed more repetive sessions in order to be able to grasp it. In class, it just moved to fast and the moves made me go off balance. Never have used any exercise that was like this. I was so grateful for this DVD as they go over each move over and over again and again. It helped me take my time to get my head around such moves. Recommend very highly for beginners and people in their 60's. Good teacher and put together well. Order arrived quickly. Am happy!"
2,visually hard to follow because you can't mirror the instructor!,"I'm sorry to say that this video is a disappointment. The instructor gives you instructions, but since he is facing you and not reversing the moves, you can't mirror him, but have to continually figure out what foot and arm to use. I am not a newcomer to tai chi, and could sort of figure out what to do from memory, but this video does not help you remember or improve the moves.consumers -- you need to find a video where you can easily follow along, so look for a instructor who either mirrors the moves or who turns his back to you, so you can see what foot and arm to use."
5,Excellent beginner's Tai Chi,"DVD contains several sections explaining the philosophy/concept of Tai Chi, an introduction to Master Chris Pei, a warm up section and the Tai Chi moves and routines. The warm up is excellent - worth starting out in the morning each day to get your body going. I now use this warm up before any of my other work out routines. The Tai Chi moves themselves are explained verbally while being demonstrated in a controlled progression to allow the viewer to follow and replicate the moves and then in the demonstration section the moves are repeated as they are learned to reinforce the mechanical aspect of the moves and then progress into Tai Chi aspects. For individuals new to Tai Chi this is a very good beginning. All the basics can be learned using good form and fundamental movements before later progressing to more advanced Tai Chi. I have enjoyed using this DVD and would recommend it to other beginners."
5,"Very nice, simple but will be challenging at the end",I am just starting withTai Chi. I found this program easy to follow and the instructor knowledgable. Taking it at my own pace so far so good.
3,"Nice, but slow","This DVD has a great warm-up, and the instructor has a lot of warmth and authenticity. However, the tai chi practice is very slow and repetitive. I don't have the attention span for it."
2,Too slow,I couldn't get into what he was trying to show. It's too slow and I guess he's supposed to be showing you what to do and then you do it on your own. I need to follow someone as they do it.
5,Arrive on time,"My video arrived on time and the packaging was suffient. Haven't spent a great deal of time on the video yet, but what I've seen and tried is very good."
4,Easy to apply the recomendations,"This book laid out an easy to follow plan to open discussion with a partner in a way that would not scare him off. The tone was conversational and friendly; like you were just out to happy hour with the girls, getting advice, sharing ideas, and learning a different approach to open communication with your partner. Better communication, understanding and love will lead to great sex -- it's true!"
4,Fun and Useful,"I think it's hard to find good information about sex that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. Dr. Laura Berman's book is really easy to read and interesting. It is a 10 step program, which makes it easy to follow. I like the mix of medical information about my sex drive and the effect having children has had on me, along with stuff I can do with my partner. He and I are laughing and getting new ideas. I think if you have an open mind this is a great book for getting back to basics. It's not just about sex, far from it. The whole point is for having a better relationship and understanding your body. I think it's a book that helps relationships and in a time of divorce that's a good thing. Highly recommended."
5,"Practical, Fun, and Innovative Advice!","The Passion Prescription was a great read! It offers more than just your usual ""tips and tricks for sex"": it goes on to provide an excellent ten week plan to improve intimacy in your relationship. We all know that amazing sex isn't going to happen overnight, so working on it over time is the best way to improve and maintain sex.Also, the book didn't just focus on sex - it discussed medical problems, emotional problems, and relationship problems. The tasteful diagrams were helpful for understanding the physical aspects of sex more clearly, and the book discussed several very interesting research findings.This book has absolutely no negatives - it will be a blessing to both singles and couples alike looking to find more sexual satisfaction in their lives."
3,The Passion Prescription: Ten Weeks to Your Best Sex -- Ever!,"The book was just OK, but the package arrived in good shape. Sorry is took me such a long time for this review. We are very happy with the results and will purchase more books in the future."
2,Not too impressed,Not too impressed with this book. I felt that it was basic information that I already know and practice. I was hoping it would help rekindle the passion in my relationship but I got nothing out of it.
2,Disappointed Widow,"I'm a 62 year old widow. I bought this book for my 58 year old girlfriend hoping to spark things up in the bedroom. She thought the book wasn't written for her and didn't find it helpful. It gave me a few ideas, but it seems like older women need a differnt kind of authorative coaching voice compared to women of youger generations. I think this book will probably appeal to younger women. The old gals need a little more authority, details about what they can expect, and direction."
5,Space Travel Music :),"From beginning to end, Sounds From The Ground have once again impressed me with their creativity, simple as that =)"
1,Region 2 products need a warning label for Americans,"Had to return the item at great personal expense, to England as it wouldn't play in any of my machines. Why are you selling English formatting in America??? Needs more explanation than just saying ""Region 2"". A lot of people don't understand the region issue."
1,"Deceptive packaging, shame on NAXOS!","This is NOT a DVD of a performance of Bruckner's fourth symphony! It is a pretty powerpoint show of colorful images from a travel booklet. MTV for classical music lovers I guess, minus any images of the actual performers.If you enjoy listening to concerts while watching the conductor and orchestra performing their respective skills, avoid this series entirely! It's a sham."
2,Keep looking,"This biography is chock-full of interesting information and especially noted for historic footage; however several long periods of interruption showing nothing more than pictures of film reels, camera lenses, and other film clips having nothing to do with the subject at hand are quite annoying and disruptive to the content. These many ""fillers"" are a waste of the gift of sight and the time could have been put to much better use by simply showing more still photos of Mother Teresa or her many work settings. I've seen many other tributes to Mother Teresa and this was my least favorite. I'd recommend those interested to consider other sources."
5,It is Sooooooooooooo Deep,E.J. Jacobs have hit the ball out of the park. I love this book it was so intense and honest. You will have to think about what you read.
4,A must read for patriotic Americans who value our military,"An informative, credible example of misdirected 'political correctness' and the improper application of affirmative action aimed squarely at our present administration. You will be shocked at the extent to which our armed forces are being affected by a corrupt system that places quotas and equal opportunity above readiness and discipline. A bit drawn out at times--the author makes similar points, often using the same words--but the content is excellent and it is worthwhile never the less. This is a thought provoking work that will stimulate conversation, and hopefully a call to arms among the masses (us), to hold our political leaders accountable to fix the system our senior military leaders work within. You will not be disappointed."
3,Not a perfect fit,"Previously had this cargo liner in my 2002 Toyota Avalon. It fit like a glove. This time I ordered for my 2012 Toyota Avalon Limited. The fit is fine on three sides, however, the drivers side is way off. Does not cover the entire floor area between the wheel well and trunk opening. Probably made this was on purpose, but I see no logical reason."
4,Reviewing for the cosmotology practical exam,Used but in good condition. Gave me what I needed to review and was delivered in a timely manner.
3,Okay book. Barely. (Yawn.),"From the first page of this book I couldn't get over the idea that this whole exercise was some marketing guy's idea. ""Hey, Cantor's famous. He could put drivel on a page and diehard soccer fans will buy it. Shouldn't be too hard to make a profit on this one. And just to be safe, we'll have it ghosted. That way all he really has to do is pose for the cover."" Cantor's an entertaining guy, but his history of the World Cup is only marginally interesting. It's stiff, and difficult to hang with for more than about ten pages at a time. All in all it's pretty mediocre stuff. If you're looking for a book that captures the entertaining goofiness of Cantor's personna, this, regrettably, isn't it. Maybe next time. I hope so."
5,Interesting read,Tom Mes gives very good information and explains Shinya Tsukamotos movies. I have a better understanding of questions that I get watching Tsukamotos films. Highly recommended for fans of his movies and wanting to learn about him.
3,Fun and Cozy Mystery,"China Bayles is the kind of woman you would like to be friends with. A smart, self sufficient, high powered attorney, who has decided to give it all up for a quiet life. Opening an herb shop in the small town of Pecan Springs seems to be her perfect idyll. Unfortunately murder comes visiting, and China, along with her friend,Roz, can't resist the scent of a crime.While not a very difficult mystery, there was much to enjoy in this book. Sharply written characters, a tightly woven plot and lots of chemistry between China and her quirky friends. There were just enough red herrings to make you play along with solving the case, and the outcome was quite believable. I plan to visit with China Bayles again soon."
5,Enjoyable,"This book and the rest of the China Bayles mysteries were very good. I'm not sure what the New Mexico reader was looking for, but I happened to find my kind of reading in this series. I hope Ms. Albert keeps up the good work & I can't wait to read her next one. I've read them all to date."
2,Avid Reader,"Book was unsophisticated. The author tried to cram a bunch of 1990 issues into a crime novel, to where characters seemed somewhat ridiculous."
1,Fell flat,"This mystery just fell flat for me. The heroine, or protagonist, China Bayles was so contrived. I didn't relate to her at all, nor any of the other characters who seemed very wooden and one-dimensional to me. I forced myself to finish it because of the author's reputation. But I was still disappointed in the end. There was a bit of anti-gun sentiment that was gratuitous I didn't appreciate. I've been reading a few mystery novels lately, and and to my disappointment, the China Bayles/Wittig Albert one did not hold up. I still prefer authors Candace Robb, Aaron Elkins, Nancy Atherton & Elizabeth Peters for mysteries."
2,A bit troubled,"There is a Police Chief Bubba Harris, an officer Peterson and a ""hispanic deputy""; no name just ""hispanic deputy"" This particular hispanic appeared twice and the second time is refered to as the ""same mustached Hispanic"". Why didn't he get a name?Then we meet Manuel, a ""heavyset Hispanic man"" on page 247 who is referred to as ""the hispanic"" on the next page and says to an undercover policeman ""si, Senor"". Manuel's English was pretty good prior to that, other than the ""ain't"" If the ""si,Senor"" was a scarcastic reply then bravo, but the description did not say scarcastic reply.I found it a little creepy and I actually cringed the third time ""hispanic"" appeared."
3,A Tepid Start to a Series,"China Bayles gave up her high stress law practice in Austin, Texas, a few years agoand came to quiet little Pecan Springs, a small touristy town in east Texasand opened an herb shop. When China's friend Jo dies of an apparentsuicide, things just don't add up for China and her best friend, RubyWilcox. With some determined sleuthing and a couple of strokes of sheerluck, they uncover some old skeletons in Jo's closet that reach all the wayto New York City and Washington, D.C.This series is comfortable enough and the characters interesting enough tohold my interest, but there's really nothing about it that makes it standout for me. I found it just a bit irritating that Albert found it necessaryto describe in detail what each and every person was wearing in each andevery scene. I really don't care if someone's scarf matches their lipstick.But other than that, it's an okay book."
5,Wonderful mystery with well developed characters.,"Susan Wittig Albert writes in a friendly style and provides well developed characters for an enjoyable read. The author is able to tie in the title herb (Thyme) with the plot in a subtle way. If you like this one, check her other books too"
5,thyme of death,"This book truly was better than the average cozy. The main character, China Bayles, has much room to grow, which I am sure happens throughout the series. The plot was actually well written and interesting. China didn't jump to conclusions, which is probably because she is an ex-lawyer. Too many times in cozies, the heroine jumps to a conclusion, early on, that the reader knows is erroneous. China is actually a smart and real heroine.The information about herbs was the icing on the cake and made the series that much more enjoyable. Definitely recommended for lovers of cozies."
3,Flawed start to intriguing series..,"Susan Wittig Albert's ""Thyme of Death"" is the first of the critically acclaimed China Bayles series. Basically, it is good, but it is also quite flawed, so it only gets three stars.(The sequel to this book is better). China, a former lawyer who burned out, is now a herb store owner in Hill Country Texas(an area of Texas north of San Antonio and west of Austin). One of her friend's Jo Gilbert dies in an apparent suicide, but China's best friend, Ruby Wilcox, sees foul play. Soon, China and Rudy find out about the secret life of a popular actress on a children's program(a Barney clone). Murder and theft are committed, and China has to unravel all the lies being told. She solves the mystery, but justice isn't complete, as a murderer is brought to justice, but the evidence of another murder is destroyed."
1,poor quality,"This VHS was poor, couldnt see a whole episode. Very static and tape would jump around and hard to watch. It was more frustrating than anything."
4,Thye real mccoy,"Fuse pulols it out and waves it around, in company with the cellist. Not all tracks to the same standard but a must have for nfusion fanatics"
5,"I'm not even a Christian, I just like good music.","Wow! I'm only half way into the first song/medley and was compelled to write this review. Wow! Many bands will scale it down for a tour versus the studio but Fred seems to have added musicians: two drummers, full horn section and full choir! Wow! I enjoy the funky stuff more than the ballads but that's just my taste. I'm not even a Christian, I just like good music. I rented this but will surely buy it and gift it many times over. It's so good I want to cry. You can't find popular music this good anywhere."
5,Classic!!!,"Without a doubt the best Fred Hammond live perfomance recorded! The opening Medley will blow you away, and that's just them getting started! ""Please don't pass me by"" is incredible and intimate rendition featuring a then little known Israel Houghton on accoustic guitar. It's about time they turned this in to a DVD!!!"
5,Gotta Get This One!!,Woo! This video is sooooo good! I mean it starts off jammin' hard and the worship is magnificent! This video is well worth the money.
4,Fred Hammond,This DVD is one of the best concert DVD's I've ever seen regardless of music style. I had no idea Fred had DVD's of his concerts and once I found out about them I couldn't wait to order. This is the first one that I've ordered and will not be the last. Fred has never let me down with his musical ability. This DVD re-confirmed my views of his talents.
4,Intricate thriller,"Looking for an intricate thriller that will keep your mind puzzled for hundreds of pages? Comes a Horseman has the usual good guy-bad guy dilemma of all thrillers, but is anything but predictable. This debut by Rovert Liparulo is a merge of Dan Brown, Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum - a real intellectual and ""can't put it down"" international intrigue. I hope Liparulo becomes a familiar name in the thriller novel world."
5,I was hooked right from the start!,"This book grabbed hold of me from the first page! Chapter Two gets my personal award for ""Best Suspense Chapter."" This is a totally engaging book that combines a thrilling plot with interesting historical and religious references. I loved this book, as have the five friends to whom I have recommended it."
5,Wow!,"This novel has all the right elements: FBI agents, an axe-wielding Norseman serial-killer, deadly wolf-dog hybrids, state of the art crime scene investigative technology, global conspiracy, a homicidal maniac who has convinced himself he is the Antichrist.....what's not to love? Throw in some intense action, a touch of gore and blood, interwoven mysteries, thrills and chills, the perfect amount of romance, hope, and redemption....and you've got one heck of a story!This is one of the best books I've read in quite some time, and I was stunned to discover this is Liparulo's first novel! Unbelievable! The story takes off in high gear and never loses steam, despite being close to 500pgs. Liparulo does his homework and it pays off. If you love mystery, thrills, suspense, and stories full of hope then this book is for you. I can't wait to get my hands on Liparulo's next novel, Germ."
4,Definitely worth the read...,"I took the time to savor this novel, reading it slowly instead of running at it with the usual breakneck speed I tackle others. It's a different sort of thriller, but one that grabs hold of you from the onset and doesn't let go. I loved the author's way with words, his ability to describe things in such a way that I felt as if I was standing there in Tel Aviv or Rome, no matter where his characters were at the time. I felt that the ending was a bit rushed, though and that is why I didn't give this one a full five stars. There was such a build up and the characters went through so much for the ending to be as abrupt as it was. Still, I think it was an excellent book and would recommend it to anyone. This one has it all, folks: prophecies, religion, secret organizations, FBI agents on the run, cold blooded murder on both U.S. and foreign soil. The works."
4,intense and exciting thriller that leaves you wanting more,"This book was a thrill from beginning to end. Generally, hyped books tend to cause me to look another place, but I did not regret reading this one. I found similarities with Dan Brown in the intensity of this book yet without such a watered down/repeated plot line as Mr. Brown.Following Brady and Alicia in their hunt for a killer only to open up Pandora's Box when going deeply into the investigation was a trip worth taking.This book had great explanation of the gore expected in the genre without any of it being unnecessary. The references to beliefs of Christianity were well stated and not over-the-top.I don't have much time to read, but I found myself unable to do much else until the end. I finished it in about 3 days. The last section of the book was the one lacking the most. It ended solidly, however."
3,Better than the Left Behind Series,"If you enjoy evil cadres and sadistic killers pursued by dedicated investigators determined to find those behind several savage murders, then you will enjoy the premise of this book... (spoiler alert) which has a plot developed around an ""anti-Christ"" theme."
2,Just couldnt get into it,"I really wanted to like this book. It has an interesting plotline and characters but the more I read it just seemed like a chore to finish,so I stopped halfway through which I rarely do. With so many good reviews it may just be me."
3,"Interesting, suspenseful, but sometimes trite","This book is interesting to read, suspenseful, but sometimes trite. I enjoyed it but did grow impatient with the contrived ""just in time"" saves that grew more common as the book progressed. If you are looking for an entertaining read and are willing to suspend belief, this book is a good way to spend the afternoon. If you insist on tight writing and something that is totally plausible, this book isn't for you. The meta-message of good versus evil, with the Catholic Church as good, was there, but not terribly intrusive. I did at times wonder if the author had been reading too many Vatican press releases. Bottom line: an entertaining but not spectacular book."
3,Comes a Horseman--Autograph Copy,"I was thrilled to receive an autograph copy of Comes a Horseman. But what really amazed me was the way Robert Liparulo pulled me into a tense thriller. I did not expect the great story telling with a variety of twist and turns that was delivered. Now I am not one to give a story away, so let me just say that this writing was well on par of Stephen King or James Patterson."
5,Just Great Music!,"Buyu Ambroise's Blues In Red is a gem. Buyu's music encompasses elements of traditional Haitian popular music and modern jazz. The cd is absolutely refreshing. Selections like Konbit Zaka, One Note Rara, and Kote Moun Yo are strongly and rhytmically driven by drummers extraordinaire Obed Calvaire and Tiga Jean-Baptiste. The horns are just senational with riffs that are well executed at both ends of the instruments. The Latin piece Minouch is beautifully played with superb soloing by pianist Frederic Las Fargeas. Buyu's lyricism can be heard throughout all ten selections on this cd. Trombonist Dion Tucker also blends well with the leader's tenor saxophone. This cd is a must have! Discover the beauty of Haitian music through jazz by buying this cd. Haiti's national anthem is played with a blues-like feeling Buyu salutes his country's bicentennial in 2004. I strongly recommend it!!!Martine Adorno"
4,WOW!!!,"This is a must have for every Haitian and for every lover of Jazz. The track ""Caravan"" take Rara and Jazz to a whole other level. Job well done!!!"
5,Like Pokemon? Read This Book!,Pokemon Return of the Squirtle SquadWould you like to be saved by the Squirtle Squad? In this book the squad saves all the Pokemon from Team Rocket. I love this book because Ash thinks Squirtle is the best pet.Student from G.P.
5,THIS IS THE ULTIMATE GUDE TO POKEMON,This book helped me beat the game and it offers a walkthrough of all the towns like which pokemon can be captured there and it also offers maps and list of items so get this book now while it's hot!!!!!!
5,Great Guide,"I was pretty much lost until I bought it. I only use it when I get stuck or just feel like looking at their PokeDex section to see when one of my Pokemon will evolve. But, it was well worth the price."
4,It is the most usefull video game guide i have ever used.,"There is only one little problem with this book, and that is that in the very end you go to the unknown dungeon and the maps for this loacation are very far off. I do not know what happened but they are completely wrong but i would still recomend buying this book it is very usefull"
2,it could have been a lot better,"1:not enough secrets in it 2:it didn't cover as much as was in the game as a regular players guide should 3:There are better books 4:Te game doesn't need a players guide except for all the secrets 5:there were no ""secrets"" in the book"
1,it had some good info but didn't last long,"my book helped untill it fell apart ,that was 3 days later then i threw it out ."
5,It WaS ThE BoMb,MY FRIEND PATRICK AND LEONARD BROUGHT THE MAGAZINE AT THE BOWLING AREA. ME AND MY FRIENDS WERE LOOKIN AT IT AND IT HAD ALL THE INFO. ABOUT THE POKEMON. IT SHOWED ALL TMs AND THE HMs. BUT THE MAP OF THE UNKNOWN DUNGEON IS TOTALLY WRONG.
4,I liked it!,"Well, the map of the Unknown Dungeon was *totally* wrong, not to metion the Chansey typo (who the hell is Lucky??) But overall it was pretty good.. at least compared to some! But what about Missingno and Mew???"
5,The Great Guide for a Great Game!,"This guide has everything you'll need. Detailed maps, a complete listing of moves and pokemon, and great tips on gameplay. The listings show when pokemon evolve, when they learn moves, and other good information. Move listings show power, accuracy, and PP. This is the best guide I could find, and I feel that you should get it!"
5,JJTGodzilla@hotmail.com,"If you don't like this book, that means you haven't read it. I mean so what if they made one misstake about a Pokémon called Lucky who gives a damn, my point is it is a great book and you have no business to put it down and if you have the guts to email me and argue that's fine with me. For those of you who said this book was great Email me and tell me what else you think about this book i like getting emails because i don't get very much. If you like putting down books than you can just GO TO HELL!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Okay, but not the best",This book is okay. It tells you all about the pokemon and items but some of the maps are not clear. I reccomend buying the nintendo power guide. This guide is the official one and it includes a sticker of all 150 pokemon (except Mew.)
1,It was terrible. It was inaccurate and nondescriptive.,"The author obviusly has poor reading skills or powers of observation because a number of things were wrong, or not described in enough detail."
2,it was ok,all I used was the maps and were it listed all the pokemon I wouldn't bye it. You can easly figure it out yourself
2,Very dissapointing,"I like the book, but i wish it had the red and blue versions in different books. I only have the blue version and it gets confusing. It also has numbers on the maps(ex. 1,2,etc..) but it doesn't tell you what they are. This is why i gave it 2 stars. There an official book by Nintendo that is much better."
3,Cool but needs improvement,"They called Moltres ""Moltos"" but only once because they spelled it the right way in the back of the book. The maps and quick and dirty path were very helpful. The one thing I would like to see is trainer tables. That way, you know which trainers are which and what Pokemon they use. In Prima's Gold/Silver guide, this feature was included. In this game, the pokemon that the trainers use is a total mystery. The makers of the book should have thought about the trainer table idea when they wrote it."
3,An average players guild,I'd cosider this a players guild u should buy when all the other copies are out.Its more of a walkthrough then a review and i wouldnt recommend buying it if u beat the game and if your working on leveling up pokemon for there moves(because u need a better line up) because there were alot of typos in that section. Otherwise this book was ok
5,It is a great book and if your a POK'eMON trainer get it!!,Do you need to know were any POK'eMON is at? Do you need to learn how to earn badges? Want to now know what your POK'eMON is going to evolve into get this magizine and you'll know all the details
5,Awesome one of the best pokemon strategy guides ever!!!,I own this book and I have the gameboy game too. this has helped me alot I would be no where without it.
2,not really good..,"this book was pretty loud if you ask me. i think that the nintendo version is the best, though. by the way, i'm pretty sure she meant chansey instead of lucky in the unknown dungeon pokéguide. oh, it is possible to beat the game in under 20 hours. i beat it in 17:46, with 151 pokémon."
4,Precise work on poket monsters america.,"It is almost perfect. The moves and items list are complete with locations. The levels are there. It even gives a three page summary on how to win. My main problem is that the pokédex pictures are too small, there is too much noise in the background and it fails to give information on pokémon 000 (MissingNo) and 151 (Mew) other than that it is perfect."
3,It was good exept there were some mistakes.,There were ten mistakes in it I think they could of done a better job on it. Me and my friends have almost beat the game it took us months so you must be lying about beating the game. So in your face Idaho freak!
4,If you like Pokemon you have to have this book!,I couldn't have gotten through this game without this book. It has everything you need to know to win.
2,Chock full of mistakes!,"Sure the maps and advice were pretty okay, but once you get to the names of the pokemon and the vital information, you really can't trust it. If you are looking for a book that has codes or deeply detailed information that is beyond the basics, this really isn't it. This book is for people who bought the game (and were born) yesterday."
3,Its the same as the red one but a different cover,"It is the same as the red with the charizard on it but with a blastoise. It would be a waist of money to buy both.Why not just have published one or the other! If anyone has information on how to get mew email me at, JAIMEG220@AOL.COM"
2,Really only the bare bones of the gameplay,"This guide was okay, but not very helpful. My friend bought it, so I read it carefully since I didn't have a guide for myself. It is a walkthrough, but not much else. The Nintendo guide gives much deeper descriptions plus the fact the the Nintendo guide gives a full quarter page soze up of each pokemon, showing their attacks, evolution, and statistics. Apparently, Prima didn't want anyone to know anything other than how to beat the game when they made this guide. And that is something almost anybody could do without a guide!"
4,"good book,a must for pokemon fans","I thought it was preety good for prima.I did find a coupel glices thought,but if your having trouble with the game buy it here,its a lot cheaper. Go Amazon!!!:)"
2,A Book with Wrong Maps,I have read it and it has wrong maps.Its a good book for looking at pictures but NOT A GUIDE!!
5,THIS BOOK IS THE BOMB!!!!!,This book is one of the best Pokemon books out there.All of you that think this book is bad are crazy!!!
4,"It told me what I wanted to know, but still had shortcomings","If you're struggling,(or if you're not)then this tells you everything you want to know. Too bad there's lots of suddle errors."
3,It was decent,We don't need any strategy guides. We here at TEAM ROCKET are PROUD to uphold our losing tradition...
5,it's was hella tight,"it's a good strategy guide and, damn i wish i could have a copy, cause my friend showed me it send copy to:14 Burr ave. SF,CA 94134 phone:415-4529960 if you dont give me a copy i will burn your building down to ashes and make all you people drink sewer water."
5,A Must-Have For All Pokémon Trainers!,"This stradegy guide is the Pokémon player's grail! It's got all the essentials for both the Red and the Blue Version. It has a step-by-step guide for each and every path in the game. Take it from me, I have 8 badges and 70 different Pokémon, this guide is great!"
1,Not the best book out there,"The Prima book looks thrown together. Some of the other books I've compared it to, such as the Sybex and Sandwich Island strat guides, are much better. Just becasue it's official doesn't mean it's editorially superior!"
1,Why do you need these books?,"I read the book AFTER completing both red and blue and I ask.. What is the point in buying a game only to follow a guide? Pokemon is not too hard to work out just be more curious, don't give up or you won't become a true pokemon master - PKW_Pikachu"
5,Great Baby Gift,"I got this on tape in 1988 the first time. I played it with my first baby--and on CD for the next two. When I hear it now, it brings back the sweetest memories of their babyhood. I give this CD as a baby gift to every friend I know that has a baby. It's a unique gift idea, and it has a very personal meaning for me. Joanie Bartels' voice was made for singing lullabies--nothing sweeter or calmer."
3,Missing song,"I have purchased this CD several times - years ago on cassette, and more recently on CD as gifts. I just purchased it for myself and when I played it, I discovered there is a song missing. Rock a Bye Baby. If you click on the song, it plays the next song. On this date (Nov 1 2010), it does the same thing in the Amazon music sampler. The CD is wonderful otherwise. Very soothing songs, wonderful melodies, great to put the little one to sleep."
4,"Good drive, bad software.","Now this HD does what it is supposed to do, be a highly portable bucket for your data, that is why it gets 4 stars. Now I didn't use the one button backup feature or really any of the software features except the password drive lock and encrypt. When the Vista gods drop kicked my OS and I reloaded my system I plugged in my drive and low and behold the software locks the entire drive and is not accessible. This would normally be ok with internet access almost everywhere but the software is also not downloadable. I had to buy another one just to get the software to unlock my first dirve. The extra drive ended up being useful but a few ""blue"" words may have leaked out of my mouth. Word to the wise, backup the backup/utility software."
2,Nice Idea but. . .,"I thought this book sounded great, and it really is set up in a fun way with the ""yield"" and all, but in the end, the pieces are all about only 16-24 measures long (one page). Good for a sampling of the styles, but not meaty enough to really be stand-alone pieces. So if you're looking simply to ""delve"" go ahead. I suppose that's all the author had in mind. Nice idea which I wish would have been developed further."
4,So far so good!,"I've used this dvd for 2 weeks now and I believe its going to improve my muscle tone. I've finally worked my way up to doing a full 20 mins in one of the 30 min. workouts. Lindsay is no joke! Her workouts were pretty hard at first for someone like me who is 35 and a mother of three. I'd even thought I was in pretty good physical shape until I tried this. I do believe that by the time I am doing a complete 30 to 45 min. workout with her I will see more results. So far I can feel the results in my abs. I'm a petite person but 3 babies stretched my belly and when I coughed 2 wks ago it would hurt, (that's how weak my muscles had become) but not anymore. My only criticism of this video is that sometimes she switches right into other moves a little too quickly and without proper demonstation. These are 2 things that I will overcome after using it a bit longer."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this DVD after reading all of its positive reviews. It states it has modified levels for beginner, intermediate, and advanced. However, the camera is focused on the advanced method at least 75% of the time. This is really irritating especially at the beginning of an exercise when you are trying to get your form right and have to wait until the camera scans to one of the other techniques. By then you've missed several reps and have to scan the DVD back. It would be a much better DVD if it had a separate video for each of the techniques. A beginner cannot get nearly as many reps in on an exercise as the video is paced too quickly. Each exercise goes right into multiple movements instead of slowly adding each one in. If you've been doing pilates or another program for a very long time, this may be for you. Not novice friendly. Go with a different DVD to get the basics down and then try this one maybe."
2,"Very Little Help, Annoying Instructor","I bought this DVD and it offered no specific help for a diastasis, or it at least seemed to contradict, in part, some of the information that therapists have offered about this condition. She does tell you to suck in your stomach, but that's about it. I am a bit of a stressed out mom, I know, but I can't bear that she calls the buttocks ""bun-cakes"" - a small point, but still. Also, most of the post-natal workouts have a teacher who states that she had children. She never did. Did she have any kids?"
3,"Not the greatest, but certainly works your core.","This DVD is ok. It doesn't excite me and get me energized or motivated, but it certainly does work if you use it regularly. I am more of a ""Dance"" person so this wasn't my favorite but it did the trick."
2,Not for everyone,I read the reviews for this product and as a regularly active fit individual I thought it would be great. Prior to pregnancy I was using the P90X videos and thought this would be better suited to my postpartum body. Well it was not what I had hoped. The routines are chopped up to be able to tailor to your own choices but I felt it was more difficult to really find what I needed. I hate stopping over and over to change the workout. The workouts were super difficult and it didn't seem to be postpartum friendly at all. I shouldn't have wasted my money and just went back to the P90X. I am sure some people love this type of exercise but it wasn't for me. I now feel like the high rated reviews must be given by ripped ab mommy's like Lindsey.
5,A Must Have,"If you are a student just taken up a course in derivatives or risk management you should have this book. if you find john hull more technical, you have Don Chance who covers options and other derivatives in a greater detail and in more words. everything you want to know about how banks etc have risk mangaement systems in place and market risk instruments is here.in case you want a greater coverage of options and pricing options, you should definatly take a look at Black Scholes and Beyond by Neil Chriss, a work of art."
2,Not for the professional,"This book is not for the derivatives practitioner, rather it is for the for the general business practitioner who doesn't want to sound stupid at the board meting. This book should not be used to teach even the most basic of derivatives classes. This book will give you a general understanding of the terminology and BASIC logic of derivatives. The mathematics and logic behind derivatives is not simple and should not be omitted from a derivatives book. Do yourself a favor and learn the math and logic, and the fundamentals of derivatives, concurrently. I would venture to guess that if enough people apply that which they learn from this book, and only that which they learn from this book, the economy will be in for a major disaster."
2,Read Hull,"I dislike Don Chance both as a person and as a writer. I find him arrogant and intolerable and that bleeds through into his writing. So, yes, I am biased.I highly recommend instead that you seek out John Hull, a much better author, he has two books; one for undergrad and another for grad (which is the 'bible' on this subject)."
2,So this squirrel walks into a bar....,"While I definitely agree with Denning's overall premise of honing the business narrative because it is so important, he told it through a ridiculous dialogue between squirrels. The tips in the margins are extremely helpful, but I would rather have read a list of those strategies of good storytelling, rather than listen to squirrels worry about their nut storage corporation. Th dialogue was purely awful and rather unbelievable. The idea of Squirrels running a company isn't even the real problem, it's how the story is constructed that makes it so terrible. I love Denning's other works, and I was really disappointed with this one."
5,A real challenge,"I've only ever played one game start to finish in my life, without and cheating or help. This was it and it took me 6 months. High degree of difficulty for a PS 2, Good graphics. Great game."
5,Brilliance from the Sea,"Not just because the author is a fellow Antiguan, but because his work is brilliant he deserves nothing less that 5 stars for ""Caliban's Reason"".First of all the text is incredibly well written, with sophisticated language and lucid literary skill. Second of all, it is extremely well balanced and objective in the telling of historical events. Third it is wonderfully scholarly and well organized.Paget first introduces West Indian origins of philosophical thought in their African roots and then expands of the creolization of such thought under slavery and colonialism and the later African Renaissance that reaffirmed the African aspects of West Indian philosophy in the early 20th Century into the 21st."
3,James Last Berlin DVD,"It's worth watching but not one of his better DVD's. It is not a current concert, so the technology is dated."
5,Great band,"I own a lot of James Last CD. This is the first time I watch his video. The brass band is his main subject. The 1982 video has the string band accompany the brass. I still prefer the 1972 Russia tour classical brass team without the string portion. He does not use French horn and tuba. Is there any reason for that? But the 1982 band included excellent percussion team.The 1972 Russion tour film clips are interesting. The audiances were very constrained in the concert, but you knew that they really enjoyed the music."
4,Review of recent DVD,The video came through in excellent shape and in good time.I am enjoying it.Thank you
4,Great music as always,"A bit heavy on the pictures, but the music is great as always. Music has changed a lot since this DVD was made, but James Last always makes music enjoyable."
4,Wanderfull,"I have had this book some years ago, but unfortunately I haven't. I am trying to find it in Spain since 1993 without results."
3,"Light, fluffy, enjoyable read","No one is ever going to mistake this for great literature or even a well-done memoir. Dr. Lesesne flits superficially from anecdote to anecdote and boasts irritatingly frequently of his accomplishments, his credentials, his skills, his big heart and his dates with a string of fabulous women. But I took the book for what it was: A breathless peek into a world most of us will never glimpse. If everything Dr. Lesesne writes is true, then he's had a most extraordinary life indeed, and his experiences alone are captivating enough to keep the interest up. You also learn a lot about the science and psychology of plastic surgery, which I find interesting from a scientific perspective. Written like a long magazine article, the book can be read in one afternoon."
4,Very interesting,This was so interesting; NOT your typical plastic surgery book. Very insightful.I wished he'd name names (it drove me nuts guessing!) but of course he can't.
4,confessions of a park avenue plastic surgeon,"very good because very human.not very instructive.if you are looking for tips and tricks,you will be disappointed.it is overall how a surgeon feels empathy for his patients but it also shows the shallow side of that fake fight against time.leaves you a little bit sad.but one question:what would the surgeon think if ugly,fat and old were the new criterias of success???????????"
4,"Works well with 65"" ball","Champion Sports Deluxe Ball BaseI wanted to use a stability ball instead of a home office chair in order to get at least a little core strengthening while working at the computer. This base holds a 65"" ball in place while still allowing some ""wiggle room"" so I can angle left or right to reach things on my desk.The photo looks like you can add casters, but a trip to the hardware store says ""no casters will fit properly."" Boo Hoo. Still good, though."
2,Unsafe in my application,"I bought the base thinking it would help keep the ball from ""walking around"" during exercise. When I first received it I was disappointed at the cost vs the piece of plastic I was looking at, but decided to give it a try. Unfortunately it slipped badly on my wooden floor making it unsafe and far worse than the ball by itself. Really a shame the manufacturer didn't design in some pads or feet that would have prevented this. In fairness it may be fine on carpet or other types of floors. Back it goes and hope this helps someone else."
1,Poor Performances of beautiful works,"Alain Prevost's performances are barely o.k. if listened to casually, as if they are sonic wallpaper. But critical listening finds the listener wondering why good money was spent on recording and purchasing such amateurish performances. Notes are scrambled, phrasing is mannered, the whole production is full of all the little guitar squeaks and scoops that the players probably don't hear any more. The set has the promise of being a really good expose of Sor's superior musical thought (where less is definitely more), but falls all over itself in shoddy playing. Don't bother with this set."
1,BAD TASTE,The taste won't get rid of your nausea it will make it worse don't try them YUCK! It was delived with no problems so I can't complain about the seller.
1,Very Disappointing,"Technically, the Dubliners were ""live in Germany"", as opposed to being dead in Germany. However, if you expect to see a lot of concert footage, forget it. Maybe a bar of this song, and a few lines of that song, but certainly not a sustained continuous concert. I think there are more scenes of them drinking in German pubs than singing on stage. And even the off-stage scenes have no voice-over discussing the scene; it's just raw, home movies. Save your money."
5,The Dubliners in Germany,"A really nice and perfect dvd of these wonderful musicians ,,,we rally enjoyed the history behind the band and the playing of those wonderful tunes..."
5,Beautiful and Romantic,This wedding topper is absolutely beautiful. Exceeded our expectations and at a price better than I found anywhere. Love it!
2,Too Sweet,"This product is nothing like a good batch of Ginger People chews. It reminds me of Chimes with its over sweet, sticky, virtually no heat, and small flavor. Pass it by if those qualities do not appeal to you."
5,Ginger lovers love these chews,"These a a perfect blend of sweet and spice. Chewy, or let melt in your mouth (if you have the will power). The only problem with these treats is how quickly they disappear. Enjoy!"
3,Get rid of the rice paper!,I really like these candies but really dislike the rice paper they are wrapped in. It's impossible to remove and I don't really like the texture when you eat it with the wrapper. I liked it when they were wrapped in wax paper better. The candy is still good stuff just the wrapper has to go!
3,Intermediate level.,"I use it as a reference for a Boundary Value Problems course at the college level. Not a beginner level text, you need a background in DEs and linear algebra.Inexpensive and a classic."
2,Not what I expected,poorly organized complicated explanation where it can be written in easier way. I would look for something else to learn PDEs
3,birds 2,this was a pretty good movie with a very slow start. it had a low body count with no real attacks until the last 20 minutes or so. then absloute choas. all in all 3/5.
2,JUST DOESN'T FLY,"If you're going to make a sequel to a film like Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, you'd better try to at least match the original. Ooops...director ""Alan Smithee"" (name given when a director pulls his name out) has no idea on how to build suspense, or sustain a mood of impending doom. The birds seem about as threatening as Pee Wee Herman in a senior citizens club. The pace is slow; the children are obnoxious. In fact, the only likeable person is played by Jan Rubes and he's not in it very much. Brad Johnson looks like someone just woke him up from a long winter's nap; Chelsea Field looks terrified of the camera; and James Naughton gives a phone in performance. Poor Tippi Hedren..she's relegated to playing a clerk in a souvenir shop and she probably wondered why in the world she would participate in this poorly conceived mess.Not recommended, even for fans of the original. This one just goes nowhere."
2,It does not last long!!!,"I recieved Rayovac NM715-8 2000mAh, not Rayovac NM715-8 1800mAh.Rayovac claims this battery lasts 3X longer than standard alkaline battery, but in fact it does not. Two of this fully charged batteries died after 2.5 hrs when I used them for my Garmin I3 while two of Duracell alkaline batteries gave me almost 6 hrs. I recharged the two batteries over night and tried again, I got the same result. I would not recomment this product to anyone!"
3,disappointed,"I was drawn by the price and the b=name- Rayovac. Should have paid more attention to the Mah rating. They just don't compare in holding capacity or long lasting, ready when you are abilities with stronger, (slightly) more expensive batteries. At $2 apiece they really aren't much cheaper than you can find shopping around for 2500 Mah AAs. Like Duracell or Sony. In my camera the Rayovac dropped from full to 2/3 full (on camera gauge) after a few shots. Others would show full for 30. They work, but takes at least 3 to equal 2 good batteries. Won't buy again."
3,saves Lots Of $$$$,"If you have kids you need to look into rechargable batteries, they save LOTS of money in the long run & are far better for the environment, etc. then the disposables. These would have received a 5 star rating but the fact they make them in Communist China now knocks them down a couple of notches in my book!"
3,Short Lived,"I used this inflator for about two years approximately 10 times a year for car/bike/lawn tractor/wheelbarrow tires. It takes at least five minutes to inflate a normal car tire from semi flat. Obviously very handy and portable when inflating garden equipment.Mine just stopped working yesterday, and when I took it apart I figured out why: the small metal bladder that is inside the piston compressor broke of, jamming the piston. Could not be fixed, so I chucked it, and am now looking for a new one."
5,Convenient inflator for a variety of tires,"I purchased mine from Amazon a few days short of a year ago, and love it. It has worked perfectly on various tires, including car, bicycle, and other sports equipment, and is small and light enough to keep in the trunk. The ability to set the lighted guage to the desired psi and have it stop automatically is extremely convenient. With a Schrader to Presta converter it works well for those tires too.Note: apparently this type of battery should be stored fully charged and not discharged completely, otherwise you will damage it. (Found this out the hard way, but I still like the product enough--after more than two years--to purchase a replacement unit for cordless use, and keep the old one for corded use.)"
5,Perfect Gift!,"My Boyfriend wanted this book really bad- I have never in my life paid $100 for a book. And when we got it, there was a price on the inside written in pencil that said $10. I wanted to die. Long story short; I think I paid way too much, but my boyfriend wanted a book about vans so it's all good. If there is a fire we are taking that book with us."
2,Expensive refills nix this product,Not as effective as the little Butler go betweens throwaway brushes. When I saw the cost of refills I knew I would toss this after my initial supply was exhausted.
4,Waterpik Flosser,"I have a permanent retainer on my lower front teeth, and have had trouble flossin between it and my gums. This ""tool"" is ideal for these teeth, and is very easy to use on my whole mouth. I really like it!"
3,"Works OK, but","I purchased this item for my kids-in-braces, to make flossing easier for them. It has done that.The shock came when I went shopping for the replacement filaments (they come loaded in a heavy plastic rack, reminiscent of a magazine for a gun). For a pack of 30, the price (retail, not on Amazon) was $5.99!"
3,WaterPk,"I bought this thinking it would be better than regular flossing, NOT. It does not get to areas in the back of the mouth and it can be a little awkward. The inserts you need to clean the teeth is very flimsy and bends too easily. This item is ok but you will still need to floss the old fashioned way"
4,"Pretty good product, although, not perfect","I purchased this flosser because I have braces and the threaders are awkward to use. This works very well to get between the teeth but doesn't go below the gum line, which is necessary for good oral hygiene.It's still not a complete replacement for flossing but does a pretty good job at cleaning between the teeth.I find that I still need to floss my teeth but alternate it with using this flosser."
5,It feels good,This is the first time I've used an automatic flosser. It definitely makes my teeth feel cleaner.
1,it dose not ues water,"i got it i used it a few times it's not worth it i can understand if it used water but all it dose is vibrate i might get more out of it if i attach a tooth brush to the end of it. for all who want a water pik, this one dose not use water....."
4,Great For Bridges.,"I have owned this product for almost one year. It continues to work flawlessly. One of the main reasons I bought it was to do a better job of flossing under my bridges. It may not be perfect, but it does a great job. It is so much easier. I would highly recommend this item."
3,Fell short.,"I was disappointed with this item. The threads were too thick to fit between my teeth. I tried using it for a few weeks, but gave up. Resorted back to shread-resistant floss."
1,"3 Cavities Where ""Flosser"" Didn't Clean","I have used this product instead of dental floss for well over a year. Recently I went to the dentist and had 3 cavities between my teeth. My dentist said that this product works well enough at the gumline but does NOTHING to prevent decay between the teeth. How could it, when it doesn't go there? Maybe if you have enough space betwteen your teeth, this could slide up and down between them, but if not, you are out of luck. Notice that this is a pick-style device, not a true flosser like the Reach Access Power Flosser, which I will try next. Also, the button is in an awkward place and requires continual firm pressure to stay on. How stupid is that?"
1,Not so great,"I have use it for 2 weeks and find it no where as good as floss. The only place it works is between the teeth at the gum line and that is not very well. The tip that you us is some what flimsy and tends to bend. All it dose is vibrate and dose not rotate. If you have no spacing you can forget it, forcing the tip in causes it to bend."
1,Junk,"I did not buy this at Amazon.com, but either way, this thing is junk. I was excited that this may make my flossing routine faster and easier with no more blue fingertips (from cut off circulation), however, after using it, I went and flossed with regular floss and it was like I was flossing for the first time. All it did was vibrate my gums. It certainly didn't clean any plaque from anywhere and I couldn't get to my molars.I have normal, straight teeth, with normal gums, no braces, so I asked my husband who has a little bit of teeth crowding to try it and it was even harder for him to floss with this thing.Returning it ASAP and going back to the ol string of floss."
2,This does not work well.,"I think if you have braces this is great. If your teeth don't touch this would be fine. If you want something that will go up and down between the teeth, and they touch, this is not for you. I would rather use floss. The only thing I can get this to do is go along the gum line at the very bottom of the teeth. That's not going to keep plaque away.The little tips are just too big."
2,it won't replace flossing,The Whitening Flosser does't replace flossing. The dental floss can clean under the gums (if you know how to do it) while the flosser clean only between teeth.
2,What about the batteries?,"I have braces and thought this product might be easier than using a ""threader"" to floss. I think the whitening thing is a bit of a gimmick, but it does a reasonable job of flossing. However, when I tried to open the unit to change the batteries, the head broke off and I can't get it to snap back on--nor can I find the battery compartment. I looked online, and I simply couldn't make any sense of the instructions. Seems like a pretty big design flaw to me."
5,Very Satisfied with the Device,I got this because it was inexpensive to use as an adjunct to regular flossing to really get into the large gaps down at the gum line between some of my teeth and hopefully whiten them. It seem to be working in the short time of used it and the effect is very refreshing. I am sort of an oral cleanliness nut and floss and use an oral irrigator as well.
2,What's the purpose?,I thought reading positive reviews can help me like the product but it's not the case with this one. To this day I am not sure why I bought it and what's the purpose. The battery power hand held flosser does not do much for me. It's pretty much a waste. :(
2,"I don't think it lives up to the description at all, it seems to have no effct","I can't imagine,by any stretch, how this gadget could possibly replace string floss I can't describe how very disappointed I am. Sadly, I ordered one as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law as well,which is really embarrassing, I'd like to at least return that one, but I opened and tried mine out, so,of course, it is not in the original wrapping.I'm waiting to hear back from the seller about my recourse, if any."
1,Flimsy,Im very disappointed with product. The replaceable tips are flimsy. They only last once and they are not firm enough to firmly clean between teeth. I threw mine in the garbage after one week of use. It needs a redesign.
1,Don't buy it,Wasn't worth the money or the time. Doesn't really do anything at all. Not great for back teeth with braces. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,best flosser for tight teeth,I have always hated flossing but this makes it easy and quick! I have tightly spaced teeth but this can quickly vibrate around the bases of the teeth as well as between them. My dental hygienist sees a big improvement.
3,Good with some flaws,"I like this product and use it regularly--but some things are annoying. It is hard to get to my back teeth because the flossing tips are too short and so is the place where they attach to the flosser. The flossing tips have a little bulb at the end that is sometimes hard to get in between tight teeth. There is no charging or charged indicator on the device. The flossing tips are provided in a loose case that doesn't attach to the base in any way.That said, I do use this every day and that's better than I've done with regular floss or other products--so it's an improvement for me."
5,whitening flosser,This product is excellent. Within a week of use it has eliminated puffiness and redness of gumline between the teeth. Teeth are very noticeably whiter. it's easy to use.
4,Why oh why.....,Couldn't Ghost Recon 2 play identically. All this game needs is Ubisoft to come along and give it some good graphics and realistic AI.Graphics:6Fun:10Controls:10Replayability:8Sound:8Difficulty:7Overall:8
1,Save Your Money For Halo!!!!!,"How are you going to make a military game and not be able to shoot. C'mon now, this game doesn't even compare to Ghost Recon. This is more like a Playstation 2 game, with it being slow paced and boring. If you want more for your money go out and buy Shrek 2. I returned my copy and saving for Ghost Recon 2 and Halo 2. Notice the pattern (lucky #2), if we're lucky Full Spectrum Warrior 2 will be a lot better (e.g. being able to shoot!)."
2,Decent Game.... for Tactical players,"If you've played games like Socom 1 and 2, and loved them, this game is not for you. If your looking for a first person shooter where you can just run into action and blow somebodys head off, this games not for you. If your looking for a slower-paced tactical, millitary game, this is for you. I'm one of the people that love the Socom-like games. Therefor 50$ was a huge dissapointment. Rent this game before you buy it. The game to me was not fun at all, but there was great graphics. To me Graphics do not make a game, they may help it, but I'm totally into gameplay, and I cant play this game longer then an hour without falling asleep."
2,Awesome Graphics but not that fun,"The graphics in this game are amazing but the game play just doesn't get me involved as much as i would like. I enjoy all types of games but honestly, both Splinter Cell's had my heart beating with excitment. I can't really say that much for this game. In order for me to give a high rating the game actually has to make me wanna go back and play it. But again, i can't say that for this game. I'm impressed with all the detail the developer went into to make this game so real. I found controlling two teams was a little more difficult and it doesn't really make it seem as though you are a member of a certain team because you have to switch back and forth between the two. I haven't played it on Xbox Live but if you're able to control one team then that might make a difference."
1,You dont do jack in this game..,I think Full Spectrum Warrior is the worst game out there... You dont do any thing you dont shot you dont run you do nothing! The only thing you are doing is moveing two teams around. You see no action. While there shooting I go out outside to get the mail and when I come back I can move the teams again. You may get this game but I wont
2,This game is very boring,if you like to do training for hours on end this is your kind of game. i bought this game two days ago expecting a great military game. i could have not been morre wrong. full spectrum warrioir is a game that was trying to be too realistic and it hurt itself in the end. my biggest problem of the game is that you are not able to shoot you can only tell your team to shoot and you sit there and watch them. it also say 1 -2 players can play but you can only have two players if you have x box live. what kind of crap is that. this game is way over rated and if you want a game that is more fun get SOCOM Ghost Recon or Conflict Desert Storm.
2,Awesome Grapihcs but not that fun,"The graphics in this game are amazing but the game play just doesn't get me involved as much as i would like. I enjoy all types of games but honestly, both Splinter Cell's had my heart beating with excitment. I can't really say that much for this game. In order for me to give a high rating the game actually has to make me wanna go back and play it. But again, i can't say that for this game.

I haven't played it on Xbox Live but if you're able to control one team then that might make a difference."
2,not what i expected,ok you see this game looks ok so you spend the money to buy it. thats where you probably will go wrong besides the fact that you cant even shot yourself the training excerises are a pain and the missions are outrageously diffucult. i thought this was supposed to be much better game but the controls are annoying the loading screen is very annoying and you have to do everything by the book no going off and having fun.
4,Must Have,"I started it up and the opening sequence was just so entertaining. It made you actually like the characters.Started playing and felt like I was back on active duty. Can't play it with my little ones being able to hear what's being said as the language was like I remembered.Only complaints that I have so far is that when they restock on 5.56 and 7.26 ammo from the truck that they should be able to pick up grenades as well. The other is that they should be able to call in airstrikes, artillery and mortar fire at a more believable distance."
4,Pretty intense/Very realistic,"I'll get the one complaint I have about this game over with and out of the way...the camera always faces the wrong way!!! When switching from team to team in the heat of a gunfight, the camera will sometimes show the head-on view of the team instead of showing the over-the-shoulder view. It's a little picky but when your teammates are taking hits and you have to keep swiveling the camera around, frustration builds. All that said however, the game is great. The graphics are top-shelf. The sound effects are realistic. ( The mid-eastern music that plays in some scenes really gives an sense of location/realism). One of my favorite aspects is the chatter that comes from the platoon personnel. Some of their comments are hilarious. All in all, worth a purchase. At the least a rental."
2,if you want a shooting game get desert storm,"If your looking for a game you ca control your troops and actually shoot the enemy get Desert storm, or desert storm II.Desert Storm and the second one made me play forever and ever i have beaten each one twice. This game is fun if your some one who doesn't like to pull the trigger and fire the gun.The graphics are great and everthing but its not a game for peope you love actualy pulling that trigger killing Iraqies. If your some one like me who like snipeing ,rifling, pistoling, in army game you shuold get DEsert stormor desert storm 2."
5,different can be good,"i reserved this game and Halo2 today and i decided i would try to fined more about it so i read some reviews. i was a little skeptical when i read you don't get to kill people yourself so i went to THQ's website and watched a few videos. it has a very good button layouts, great graphics, and overall it looks like a pretty cool game. don't get me wrong, thin is DEFINITELY NOT NEAR AS GOOD AS HALO2 WILL BE, but still a real neat game."
1,Oppression against muslims should be stoped,I cant believe itA computer game and the soldiars who kill and torture people appear as angels.Also they fire at the mosques and destroy whole cities and after all they want to be heros.What is going on. These games companies dont see but money. no respect for Iraqi's feeling.What do you think if I make a computer game that shows American as targets and murderer. What do u think if game environment is London or Paris.It seems like the word justice has died in the west and for everSaraa
4,Looks good so far...,"Just picked it up, the graphics are amazing. IGN.com gave it 9.2 out of 10. Looks like a must have this summer for the Xbox."
3,Close but not perfect,"Full Spectrum Warrior is the closest thing to a simulation of a real mid intensity urban battle that I have ever seen, but there a few annoying diffrences. First of all no smart soldiers would ever stay that close to each other. Thats just askin to catch a grenade. It would have been better if the teams had been able to spread out and engage the enemy like you really should. The thing that really annoyed me the most about the game is some of the dialog. Alot of it is really funny, but when you are fighting and getting shot at no one says some of that stuff. And no one says Hooah like that. I hate that"
2,"To bad, so sad","My excitment for this game was quickly dampened after the first few missions of repetitive suppression and flanking techniques.As other reviewers have mentioned, the graphics are top notch, the sound is great, and the music is reminiscent of 'Black Hawk Down.' However, I was entirely bored by games end. My buddy and I both got copies of the game to play online, but unfortunately, you must relive the origional game over again.As to the AI in the game, others have given honest opinions when they expressed that it completely sucked. Again, the AI is repetitive and advanced levels of the game do not offer much more hope.As to timing and content, this game has nothing to do with Iraq or 9/11. However, if you are hyper sensitive to this issue, I recommend you pick up the video game Shrek 2 in order to avoid being offended.Overall, I must say that I am dissapointed. Hopefully some of the kinks will be worked out for FSW2.Cheers"
3,Didn't make it pass the training mission,"Sorry, but the game makes you go through this tutorial course that is the slowest, most boring thing I've ever had to suffer through. The guy in the game would say ""You can press the B button to do this"" *I press the B button, nothing happens, the dude keeps talking* ""Now, press the B button to do this NOW"" *then I press the B button and the tutorial advances to the guy saying ""You can press the A button to do this..."" I didn't even finish the tutorial since I was so bored/insulted by this game which must of thought I was an idiot. Buy this game if you have patience and like war games where you don't shoot any guns yourself. Avoid this game if you're impatient and like balls to the wall action."
4,"Finally, a true combat simulator","This game is the real thing. If you want Halo in cammies, this isn't it. But this is as close to true combat as any game has ever come.The graphics are superb, the sound and music are first rate and the game play is unbelievable. Even the radio communications are true to Army doctrine. I am consistently laughing at ignorant gaming companies that obviously received their views of the military from Hollywood. Not these guys. They know their stuff. Great game.If you like the Tom Clancy games, this one trumps all of them.There is only one negative - the fire teams sometimes do not react to commands as quickly as I would like. But other than that, this game is wonderful. Just don't expect a first person shooter and you'll love it."
3,Not realistic,"From viewing the video clips, its clear the US soldiers in this game employ a 'spray and pray' approach to every incident; this is not realistc, and more like what today's untrained Iraqi soldiers do, not highly trained US servicemen. Not once did I see members of a squad *aiming* precise or controlled shots vs. the enemy, which is just not realistic. In every engagement the majority of members in the squad should be seen taking aimed shots -- sure the SAW gunner lays down supressing fire, but they really dropped the ball on this with having no one taking aimed shots with their scope-equiped rifles."
2,"Worth a rent, nothing more...","You hope there's more to the game than you initially encounter, but sadly there isn't. I completed the game in less than 6 hours of casual play and given the repetitive nature of the game, I see little need to go back and take care of any unfinished business.The concept of the game is novel, but the functionality is so limited as to make you wonder when things will really start to open up. They never do. As a fan of Counter Strike I had hoped that one day a game would merge true military tactics with a FPS. This game isn't it.There is a tremondous amount of potential in this game when you think of the possibilities of including specific aiming functions, but it's only potential.Graphics 10Sound 10Gameplay 3"
2,Not much player involvement.,"The graphics, atmosphere, and overall look of this game is pretty good. The gameplay is lousy, and has no replay potential. Remember those old games like space invaders or Pac Man, where once you figured out the sequence you could play forever? Well, FSW is a lot like that. There really is no skill or manual dexterity required, and really not even many alternatives to how you accomplish the missions. You are not free to move everywhere on the map. You just get channeled down a certain route, and then shoot who pops up. Basically all you do is place your cursor on the enemy and tell your squad to shoot. It takes these guys one shot to hit someone 400 feet away up on a castle turret, and around the next bend they use 300 rounds to hit a target hiding behind a hot dog stand. There really is no use of tactics, you just try a different combination of shooting, grenades, smoke grenades and see which one the game is programmed to perceive as a success."
5,Davis Cup,A great book and a fine review of the Davis Cup and its history. Several timeless photographs and interesting accounts of the ties as they were played. Any fan of the Davis Cup should own this book. If you have been to or watched the ties you will enjoy the memories. If you have not you will enjoy understanding the history and why the Davis Cup should become one of the most important championships in sport.
4,This brush looks like it'll work,"This the slicker brush seems like it'll work for other dogs but I have a coton de tulear who has alot of think hair and I felt the bristles were too stiff and might give my dog brush burn, Although they give you instructions on how to get the bristles broken in which I tried didn't work for me the pins are hard and pointy. I tried many times using their idea to break in the bristles by using a floor I tried using the ground which was rough then a floor which I didn't want to ruin, but it didn't work for me. I kept the brush only because it was too much of a hassle to return it. I went to walmart and found the perfect slicker brush by Wahl which is the best the bristles were soft and not as pointed and was easy using and didn't cause my dog's skin brush burn which is uncomfortable for any dog. I am not saying don't buy this because this may work for you but it didn't for meSuzanMesquite NV"
2,Weird light from LEDs,"I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned the weird color light the LEDs put out. The light is not white, but an eerie sort of lavender color. And the light is so intense in the center that I have to keep whatever I'm reading in the edges to avoid hurting my eyes. It would make a better flashlight than reading light. I wish I'd resisted the tiny Gold Box discount. This is an impulse buy I regret."
5,Best Reading Light,This is the best reading light. I've tried quite a few. I didn't care for the type that attached to the books because they seem to weigh the book down. I was using a flashlight on my shoulder. This works so well because it is comfortable and sturdy. I can even put it on my nightstand and use it as a night light if I need to get up.
4,Great book light,"The light is not on your normal book light; you can place it on your pillow, the light is adjustable and the price was very reasonable. It is great for reading paperbacks...all of my other book lights have been too heavy."
1,It would be a good item but...,"the ""colors may vary"" meant, in the case of those shipped on my order, two lights that were a *bad* shade of pink. I'm usually able to look beyond that sort of thing, but these look horrible. The form kills the function."
2,Stretched out of shape after first time,"I was so disappointed in this item; I had bought it for an arthritic knee. It did feel good on, not too biding but stretched out of shape after first time worn. I am going back to a long-time name in the industry, Ace for my next one."
3,Yay superbowl,"I had ordered these to be shipped in time for the Superbowl. I think they arrived MONTHS after. Oh well, they weren't expensive, and I suppose I can use them for the next one."
3,Good as a Starter Kit,"My concern is the bag. Very uncorfortable when you are carrying the camera and the Tripod at the same time. The bag is for a small camera not for a slr, I have to detach the lens from my Nikon N60 because barely fit in there.The tripod is very light, is easy to use and is worthy considering the price. But if you are looking for one more strong and steady this is not for you."
1,"Dissapointed, but you get what you pay for.","Cons:Flemsy: Must be very gentle or you will break off legs.Cheap parts: Screws and bolts strip very easily, plastic isn't very durable, and the whole thing is not built very squarely. Have to finagle and shimy things to get them level.Not small: Fully closed it is still 21"" my good tripod is only 24""! This really doesn't seem travel to me. And if you put it in a bag I am sure that it would be broken by the time you got where you were going.Pros:Cheap.It works, kind of.Clamp locks for legs.The mini tripod is cool, I think they were trying to make up for the horrible travel tripod.I would only use this tripod to set up a camera for still shots. If you plan on moving other than picking the whole thing up and moving, get something else. If it were not as cheap as it was I would have returned it. But I think the mini tripod was worth the small amount payed."
2,You get what you pay for. . .,"This product is sufficient for the price, but if you're trying to use it for anything that a tripod is used for in more than the most amateur attempts, this just doesn't cut it. The legs are very thin aluminum tubing (careful, it will BEND if you are rough with it) and the hardware that connects everything is cheap, loose plastic. It is very hard to get the camera on and off the mount, because you're always scared of breaking something. It is also very hard to tighten it down so that it actually holds the camera steady (even torqued down, mine will still shift if it's bumped.) If you want a cheap tripod to hold your cheap digital camera, this is for you. But if you need a sturdy base for your DSLR or expensive video camera, then look elsewhere. And by the way, the little mini-tripod in the handle is useless. It's too short and the legs are not adjustable - might as well just set the camera straight on the table instead of on the tripod on the table."
5,Love it!,I love this product that I purchased! And the best thing is that I got the order overnight without paying for expedited shipping!
4,Tripod with Mini Tripod and SwitchGrip,"The product seems to be functional, I have not yet used it. There was some confusion on delivery as there were no instructions indicating where the Mini Tripod was in the box. I called the Seller, and was advised that since it was not in the box a replacement would be sent. A day later the Seller called to advise that the Mini Tripod should be located in the handle of the full size tripod, as the handle doubled as a storage location for the Tripod. On checking it was discovered to be there. It would be prudent to include some directions as to the operation of the Tripod. Other than that, it was delivered quickly, and it appears to be functional. Thanks JD"
4,Richard Scarry never goes out of style,I read Richard Scarry books when I was a child and I love that my children are now reading them too.
4,"really fun, need old system","I think the game is a hoot, I had to find an old console that had Windows 98 to play it since the resolution required isn't supported by using the Windows partition on Windows 7"
5,I wish someone would update this classic PC game,"This is an old PC game; it even pre-dates the James Cameron movie. But the care and detail that went into recreating the actual ship and the general cleverness of the game itself (which is secondary to the fact that you are actually running around on the Titanic) is extraordinary.The graphics would no doubt be better today (the talking head characters are fun, but their mouths don't synch up with the dialogue), and there'd likely be no need to switch back and forth between discs, but the main problem with the game is that it is generally incompatible with any Windows operating system older than XP. It seems a shame someone can't use the basic template created by the now defunct company that created it and make an updated version. Interest in the Titanic isn't going away, and there's nothing quite like an engaging, character driven, historical adventure game."
3,A pretty good game overall.,"Pros:-fun gameplay-great creat a player feature-great graphics-good songs-great commentaryCons:-franchise mode sucks!!!!(you can finish all 20 years in a day)-no trade a player feature (you are stuck with all of the old rosters and cannot even change the lineup)overall, this game is just okay, but I am sure that there are better games out there"
5,This is a terrific product!,This is a very high quality filter. The flow rate is great and it seems to be well built. It is very easy to use. We have taken it backpacking and are about to take it on a canoe trip. This is a must have if you hate the pills.
5,Works great!,I purchased this product to have on hand in case of an emergency. To test it I made a cup of tea. The water purifier worked like a charm and left me with nothing but water without a trace of the tea. I'm pleased with my purchase.
1,I wish I could give it a ZERO,This case didn't fit well at all! Terrible construction. The magnet flap didn't stay shut at all. I returned this item the same day it got delivered. I recommend buying a Krussel case. I have owned three different cases by them and loved each and every one! The sena case is garbage. You're better off using a plastic bag to protect your precious blackberry than buying this case.
5,Early 90's in the devil town,A nice document to a forgotten decade in Augusta.Some great (and not so great) bands plus a few spoken word nuggets from anarchist/anti-christ Joe Brennan.Definitely worth the price of admission.
3,ronlin69,"this was just okay. Don't know what I was expecting, but this was not it. Not bad if you don't have anything else to listen to. I would not reccommend this unless you are just a true diehard Beyonce fan."
2,Could have been better,"There were some really intriguing ideas in ""Sins of Commission"" - some very alien aliens, a series of crimes to solve, personal conflicts that need resolution.Unfortunately, Wright's writing skills do not match up to her imagination. The characterisation did not match that in the TV series particularly well, and the writing was frequently clunky. Some matters, such as Tarses' problems and his solution, were explained less clearly than they should have been.""Sins of Commission"" could have been better. Let's hope that Wright keeps at it, so that her skills come to match her creativity."
3,Not a bad book.,"It was a tough call on whether to rate this book three stars or four; it's better than most of the books that I've rated three stars, but just not quite good enough for me to rate four stars. It gives us a reasonably interesting look at some of the personalities of the Enterprise crew, and there is some action and intrigue as well. It's reasonably well-written, too, but the plot itself just isn't really that memorable. The story would have made an interesting episode, but as a book, it's just a bit above middle-of-the-road."
4,Aprendiendo del Maestro,"Este libro es uno de los mejores ensayos acerca de la vida del gran criador y entrenador de caballos de carrera Federico Tesio, segun su socio."
4,poetic and dreamlike,"A creative story about a girl named Cherokee. She's in a band but all of the members are having self image issues making them not sound so great. She goes to her friend Coyote for help and strength for he is magical. He helps her friends find inner strength but their power corrupts themselves and endangers their lives. She comes to Coyote for more help but he can't help, it is all up to Cherokee to save her friends lives. Francesca Lia block is one of my most favorite writers for her style is so unique and poetic and this story is a good example of that."
5,Different. . . . .,"It was good, very different, I liked it. A quick read. Try it you might like it. She's a very good author. Cast a weave of words."
1,Absolutely Terrible!! DO NOT BUY!! Save your money!!,"WORST ADVICE AND DVD I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY LIFE!! Do not waste your money on this DVD!!!My dad bought this DVD for me as a X-mas gift. I watched it with my wife and am infuriated that my dad got scammed into buying this DVD. My wife went to Haas Business school at UC Berkeley and thought this DVD was absolutely ridiculous and laughed the entire time (this is not a comedy!). I thought it was terrible as well, not professional, he talks so much WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL!!One final thought. When people usually talk in front of a green screen, they have another background, not just a green screen!!TERRIBLE, DO NOT BUY!! It's just his friends commenting on it saying it's the greatest!! All from Austin, TX!!!"
4,Good for newcomers to embedded programming (or possibly instructors),"This is a good book for novice embedded programmers (4 stars for that group, otherwise 3 stars). It covers a wide-range of topics with a reasonable amount of depth. It is a collection of articles so it loses something that a focused tutorial book would do better. Some of the older articles should have been edited and updated for this book instead of just noting the changes (maybe this was a legal issue).The CD provides additional information.For novices, I slightly recommend the David E. Simon book over this one, but this book is better than the Michael Barr book."
1,A poor collection of articles !,"This is not a book, but a simple collection of articles.The result is an extremely poor ""Work"" !The claimed "" ...plenty of practical 'how to do this' "" and the source code are unrateble."
5,Great for all audiences,"Being new to embedded systems, I really appreciate Colin's ability to explain the subject in practical terms versus all the deep theory you typically find in other technical books. In my opinion, someone who can break down technical concepts for anyone to understand really knows their subject well.Thanks again Colin. Your book definitely inspires me to read and learn more about embedded software design."
1,Not what it seems,"I purchased this for my father, a retired Marine from WWII and Korea. It is mostly old military films starting at Guadalcanal, through Korea, and I think some from the Gulf War - we never finished it. There are several films about boot camp, basically all the same. The narration is difficult to understand, and there is no closed captioning. There is no history at all. I recommend the History Channel for DVDs. I'm never disappointed with them, especially The Pageantry of the Corps. I wish I could return this item."
3,Bastante aceptable para amenizar fiestas,Lo mismo que el otro disco de LLayra. Si amenizas fiestas este material bailable (Cumbia) es aceptable por que a quien no le gusta la cumbia.Recomendable tenerlo en la coleccion.
3,Organic Tortilla Chips,"The freshness date was near expiration when we got the case of chips. Luckily it is cold, so we have stored the case in the garage. They also taste fine if you heat them briefly in the microwave, probably becuase they are organic, so none of the oil used was rancid."
3,Disappointed,"I absolutely love how Liz Story creates entrancing melodies on the piano and have been a fervent fan for years. However, this album was certainly a disappointment. I appreciate how she has created music for the Zodiac but the melodies are dry, redundant and do not resonate her trademark style and musicality. I still feel that her talent is unsurpassed and look forward to future productions. This album may have been an experiment that doesn't work for me."
2,Tropix Cat Gazing Ball,"I bought this cute cat with gazing ball a few years ago for our yard. It has withstood hundreds of torrential rains and looks as good as new! It's a great buy. Since then, I've bought two more as gifts. They were shipped immediately and arrived within a few days without any problems."
4,Carolina Herrera Body Lotion,"I love the scent of Carolina Herrera lotion. The productis hard to find and I was glad that I was able to orderthe lotion online. It did arrive within the week that I hadplaced the order. I didn't give 5 stars, because the bottledid not resemble the photo that is featured above thisreview. It wasn't wrapped or sealed in plastic, not was it ina box. There was just a bottle of lotion in a box, that was it!I was leary about using a lotion that hadn't been sealed.There wasn't any receipt along with the product. I am alwaysimpressed with how Amazon wraps and ships and this wasnot in sync with my past experiences."
1,wrong photo and description for item sold,"i've buy this item (3 items) for a gift in other country and what a surprise when item gifted was a body lotion for someone who can't use any body lotion (only prescripted). i don't recommend this since amazon support told me to make a little disscount over items for the system mistake! be careful with the information between the items, photo and the description in shopping cart"
4,Good buy,Good buy and love the smell. Only gave it 4 because one bottle was a little short. Not the full 6.75 oz. Manufacturer error?
3,SEXY FRAGRANCE,"I WEAR CAROLINE HERRERA EAU DE PARFUM WHEN I GO OUT FOR THE EVENING AND FOR 'SPECIAL OCCASIONS. I THINK THE FRAGRANCE IS 'SEXY'. THE LOTION'S CONSISTENCY SEEMS TO BE TOO LIQUID FOR MY LIKING, BUT I LOVE THE FRAGRANCE"
4,The Loretta Young Show-Christine's Children Series,"I am really enjoying this series, I had never seen it previously. My favorite is still the original Loretta Young Show, though. I have always been a Loretta Young fan! I hope that the rest of the original shows become available, as I would really like to complete the series."
5,The Loretta Young Show-Chtistine's Children Series,Loretta Young as we who remember her love seeing her. The stories are well acted and had a moral that is still are relevant today. Miss Young is as lovely as always. Wish the show had lasted more than one season.
1,Very disappointing,"Within six months, the guitar is falling apart. Very poor quality. I expected a lot better. Even a starter guitar like this one should last longer than a few months."
3,Dean ML,It`s worth for the price. Dont expect a high end quality guitar. Mine come with some dents in the back of the headstock. Pickups are decent. Its a good guitar for the value but dont expect too much for the price. Mine was $95 at sale.
3,"Biggest hot curlers on the market, but flawed.","Turning frizzy hair into sleek, nearly-straight waves requires really BIG hot rollers. This set has five extra-large rollers, the largest I've ever found, and no useless smaller ones. (Don't buy two sets. Buy one set and order extra rollers with the enclosed order form.)It really works, if you can put up with some inconveniences:Wear gloves when handling the heated rollers. The cool tip is too small, and the plastic edges are too hot to handle.The clamps leave a horizontal ""dent"" in the curl. Fix it with a hair dryer and styling brush after removing the rollers.For travel or storage, find a large rubber band to secure the lid. It does not snap into place.Heed the warning and keep out of reach of children. The heating plate is exposed and the curlers are *very* hot.If you cannot tolerate the inconveniences, consider Conair's ""Big Curl"", with slightly smaller rollers--and a loopy curl--but superior product design.For the smoothest waves, get this set."
1,Not good for travel,The Helen of Troy Hot Setter burned my fingers and only caused me much frustration. The top of the container doesn't fit securely and the curlers fall off the spindle holder very easily. The clips don't have a place to be stored so where's the travel convenience in that? I would have to create a container just for these curlers and clips while traveling or search for them all rumpled around in my suitcase. I only used it once and returned it.
3,"New, maybe, but not improved","These rollers replace the Revlon Radiance travel rollers. Pro: it packs flatter than the Revlon Radiance did.Con: takes dam near forever to heat up (15 minutes & not a second less). When you're trying to get ready to go out, those extra 12 minutes are virtually unbearable. The reason it takes longer is that the heating elements just touch the bottoms of the rollers, unlike the Revlon Radiance who's heating elements went up through the center of the rollers. The stumpy heating elements are the cause of another problem, & that's keeping the rollers in place on the heater. They tend to be a bit wobbly.Other than that, it does what it needs to do."
3,Only So-So,"While these are the biggest rollers I could find, I'm not thrilled with them. The rollers don't sit securely on the heating element. If the side of the roller touches the heating element, it melts. Also, it doesn't have a cool place to grip so either you are holding the flocking or you are burning your fingers on the plastic part of the roller. That said, the rollers do give a nice curl to the hair which holds all day."
3,Travel Hot Setter,I really thought the size of the rollers were too big and they didn't heat up fast. But they are compact - although they didn't do much for me..
1,No curl,I didn't find that these hot rollers added any curls to my hair. They don't get hot enough to add curl.
1,Not well made!,"These curlers are so hot I can't hold them long enough to get them in my hair. Also,the lid does not close securely which is irritating. I finally put them in the trash. Don't waste your money."
1,So disappointed,"I was so excited to get some jumbo hot rollers. I was so disappointed in this product. It states it is cool touch. There is nothing cool to the touch with these rollers. I only tried to use them once but they were so hot to the touch, I couldn't get my hair rolled. I won't try again I only bought it because it said Helen of Troy but they just sell it, not make it. Also, when I plugged it in, it started smoking and had the smell of an electrical fire. Not a good product at all."
3,"works fine, but....","This set of large rollers does the job, but it is annoying to use. The individual rollers sit on a very shallow heat rod and so you must keep the lid on and be sure they are straight to heat properly. They do get quite hot, so be prepared. The manufacturer suggests you let them heat for 15 minutes before using and leave them in for 15 minutes. On the plus side, they are great for travel because of the overall size and dual voltage."
1,Disasterous,"The curlers don't fit on the base properly, therefore the lid doesn't either. They were very hot to handle and yet never got more than lukewarm on the curler itself, where your hair wraps around. The clips were a nightmare to use and didn't hold the rollers, they slipped out constantly.I tried 3 times before I threw them away. Complete waste of time. I gave one star because I had to."
3,Wear gloves curlers are HOT,"Love the soft curls they produce, but they get really hot. I wear gloves to set curlers."
3,Hairsetter,"Nize size, but the plastic on the plastic get hot and burn your fingers when you roll your hair."
1,Builds Bad Programming Techniques,"This book TROUBLES ME. The author has no concept of good algorithms and data structures. Example: he builds a queue using arrays instead of Linked Lists. The array sets a limit on the amount of structures you can store in the queue. If you use a Linked List Object you can have unlimited storage and better overall performance and OO design. Try this book instead: ""Data Structures & Algorithms in Java"". This is a much better text. It is more of a computer science text but written so the reader can absorb all of the concepts."
2,Painful,"This is painfully grim. I hate to say, as I'm a big fan of Elvis. It's the usual, CC Rider, Polk Salad Annie, etc. A few highlights are You Gave Me A Mountain, Blue Christmas. Wooden Heart - no wonder he didn't sing this too often. It has to be among the worst of the songs he recorded, really terrible.He sounds tired, irritable, bored and spaced out. The difference between this and the early 70s recordings is stark. He should have been tucked up in bed going through some much needed drug withdrawal.The usual intros to the band are given. This is a man who was working on automatic pilot. I'm amazed the buying public put up with it.I hate to say it, but this is pants. What a shame. It's not the way he should be remembered. Usually a fan of the FTD releases, this is really scraping the bottom of the barrel."
3,Christmas in Las Vegas,"This is a rather typical Elvis concert, from December 1975. I would rate this concert as slightly above average, as Elvis seems to be in better spririts than he often was during this time period. Elvis performs many of the same songs he performed over and over again in concert, but there are a couple of surprises. He sings an obviously unrehearsed version of ""Wooden Heart"", and performs ""Blue Christmas"" by audience request. Elvis concerts tended to have a sameness to them, and you don't really need to get this CD unless you are an Elvis completist, like me."
3,V What happened?,"It is about time that they FINALLY came out with the V Series.I was about 11 or 12 at the time that they had a miniseries called V that rocked the pants off of NBC executives. Then they brought out V: The Final Battle.Then they came out with a TV series called V.The problem is that what you could do with a mini series was harder and more expensive to do with a WEEKLY TV Series.Therefore, main characters were written off in unexplained plots.NBC moved the series around so much that when the TV Series Finale came about a lot of NBC affiliates didn't even air it.V: The Original MiniSeries A+V: The Final Battle A+++V: The TV Series C+"
3,Just a warning to unwary viewers,"This review is more about the product itself than the series.Although there are two plot summaries shown--the ""Plot Outline"" summarizes the second series, the ""Plot Synopsis"" summarizes the original series--this DVD only includes the *second* series. I don't understand why it's called ""The Complete Series"".If you want the original mini-series, well, that's another DVD altogether."
5,V-series,I am a huge fan of the series and I received it in perfect condition and enjoyed watching again! thanks amazon for your great service from a long standing customer! Mark Dods
3,Almost - But worth a giggle,"We saw the pilot series of ""V"" last fall, and wanted to see the earlier version. We were told the ones done in the 80's were better than the modern one . . . . well, not so! The package was almost a bargain, but apparently picks up long after the first series of episodes - so in a way, it's coming into the play on act II. The special effects and acting is so bad it is comical - which is the only value for the package. If you want comic relief sci-fi, this would be suitable."
5,Excellent!,Got this item in a very timely manner. Was just as it was advertized. Wanted to compare the 80's series with the new series. Haven't watched much of it yet. Thank You!
1,The Complete Series ????? WHERE IS THE END? TO BE CONTINUED.......,"I really liked this shows , however the show didn't END.... IT ENDS AS TO BE CONTINUED... BUT THERE IS NOT CONTINUATION SO FAR, AND ALSO THE ENDING OF THE LAST EPISODES REALLY SUCKS !!! THE FIRST SEASON WAS EXCELLENT , BUT THEY SHOULND'T MADE THIS ONE, BESIDES THE NAME IS WRONG (COMPLETE SERIES) THIS IS A RIP-OFF."
3,Not so good but would be better,"This follow up to the V the Final Battle Mini-series has some good eps but others are a bit flaw,that's why was cancelled after only 19 episodes."
2,Don't Bother,V the orginal and V the final battle were awsome- but the series just got so stupid and turned into a soap opera. They should have quit while they were ahead
2,"Great Series, but false advertising.","I just picked this up at a store, I thought it was the complete series, as the title suggest. It is not. It does not have the first episodes, or final battle(miniseries ending). This would have gotten five stars had it been what the title suggested. But given that It starts after about ten episodes and a four hour movie, it is hardly complete. Great if you have the others, be ready to have to buy the other two DVD sets for the ""complete"" complete series."
1,"V The Complete Series , Are you sure?","I don't know why this DVD is named V- The Complete series, when really isn't complete, I just bought this series today but it's not what I thought it was going to be. I was hoping that it would be the complete miniseries included that was first on tv in 1983 not only 1984 sequel.Don't buy it if you don't want to be disappointment."
1,"Misleading packaging, it's NOT the miniseries","As someone who had heard, over the years, how good this show was, I was initially dumbfounded when I bought the DVD at my local video store only to find it to be a poorly produced bore-fest. In addition, the first episode kept making historical references to events that, as far as I had heard, should be occuring in the future of the series, but had evidently already occured. After some closer inspection of the box and quick jump online, I discovered that what I had purchased, ""V: The Original Series,"" was in fact not what I wanted. What I wanted was ""V: The Original Mini-Series.""Now I'm sorry, but the difference in titles is minimal and as the show came out twenty years ago I would expect that even seasoned V veterans could make such a mistake. Make sure you buy what you want, otherwise you're likely to be disappointed.Note: This isn't a review of the DVD itself, merely of its packaging."
2,Vapid,V:The television series is by far inferior to the two miniseries that preceded it. NBC would have done better to limit the show to six to ten hours per season.The show was also revamped midway through in an effort to recapture what made the mini's great. Sadly it was too little too late and the series ended with an unresolved cliffhanger.
2,"V: The ""not so"" Complete Series","This product does NOT contain either ""V: The Original Mini-series"" or ""V: The Final Battle"". I foolishly thought that ""V: The COMPLETE Series"" would include all V episodes. The product description was not clear either way. This should more appropriately be called ""V: Season One"", ""V: The Complete First Season"" or even ""V: The Incomplete Series""."
2,V = very boring!,I remember as a teenager absolutely loving this science-fiction series and I could not wait until the next episode. What did I see in it???? Watching a number of episodes (not all as yet) I am finding the story line to be slow and tedious. I guess my tastes have changed. The only consolation is that I did not spend much money for this series!I would not recommend this series unless you have problems with insomnia!From a positive view point the dvd series was delivered prior to the time stipulated which was good -thanks!
5,Got to have it. !!,If you like the new 2009 TV Series V...then you have to have this in your Collection to really see the evolution how this show from the past has evolved into a great TV series.
3,A nice continuation for hard core V fans,"If you can't get enough of ""V"", then this series is a great addition to your collection.The story has holes (Does Elizabeth have a lizard tongue, or did I just see her lick her lips with a human one?), but the writers seemed to make an effort to have a sort of Sci-Fi purist logic to it - in, for instance - the way they deal with the red powder virus/bacteria and how it stops affecting the Lizards on some parts of the planet.It's this kind of attention to detail that makes the story interesting to fans of Sci-Fi, and an undiscovered gem for people who've only seen the miniseries."
4,"Yes, I am #69 reviewer! (Worth it if you like V)","Well, it ain't that bad overall. Pretty much all the bad reviews are right (cheesy, poorly acted in some cases, bad FX, weird stunts, etc) but all the good reviewers are right too (fun action, great story arc throughout the whole series, great characters, etc.)I'm just so happy to have a continuation of the whole V experience. I loved the mini-series like crazy. It is awesome and stands up to the test of time with anything. This series looks dated but I think they did the best they could with what they were given. TV is not the movies and production values can't always be maintained.I think it was gutsy they decided to kill off certain members, made watching it more dramatic and tense. After a while it got silly when people left but again, they did what they had to.And for those that feel misled by the DVD title, get a clue: it IS complete. Don't be confused between this and the mini-series, they are seperate and should be."
4,Very Nice series,"Is a series that no one can miss, but really the best chapters are those of the miniseries at the beginning, this extra time is pretty good, falls a bit the quality of the final episodes of the series, which is why they have canceled it, but even tough, I recommend it, and for this price please!!!."
2,Boring,"I watched the 2 mini series when they were on TV long time ago. I loved the 2 shows. So, I bought this set thinking what a great deal to have 2 mini series with a great price. I was so wrong.It turns out that this set is actually a regular TV show that was made after the two mini series. I don't even know they made another TV series. Nope. Never heard of this.I guess they ran out of budget. The episodes are slow and boring. The performance from the actors are good but the story seem rushed out from the writer. I can even see the couple of film crews and the cameraman wearing a T-shirt from the reflection. LOL. They definitely ran out of money. After watching the first 4 or 5 episodes, I have to let it go. Can't watch this series anymore. Too boring.2 stars."
5,V - ery good Sci-Fi,I watched this years ago and wanted it for my collection. A very good science fiction and really should be brought back for new viewers.
3,whats with the alien double voices? gone?,one of the things i loved the most about this show were the voices of the aliens and this was a central point in the original series but now they talk like humans and thats a very big hole in the plot because one day humans have to manage a way to talk like aliens and then in the next chapter aliens talk like humans. that without mentioning how cool they seemed with those voices.actually i think that was one of the major points of the series. i hate to see this overlooked.
5,REMAKE,"i cant really say if i like it or not, i havent seen it. i got it for my boyfriend...but he LOVES it and is demanding that they do a remake!"
4,This was a series my husband requeted me to find,My husband had been talking about this series and so I was happy that I found it so he could have it.
4,Brought back memories,"My husband and I use to watch ""V"" on tv regularly when it was a series. Now every Saturday evening I'm enjoying watching hours of V. Watching the series has brought back so many memories. If you're not a V fan, you wouldn't like it because the graphies are so ""cheesy"", it was the best they had to offer in the 80's. If you are a fan you will enjoy it. I can't wait to see what the new V series which is airing in November is going to be like."
4,Classic TV Show on DVD,This is a classic TV Show that should have lasted more than 1 season. I love the original movies and hope they remake this show to let the viewers know what happened with all the main characters because the ending episode leaves you hanging. All in all my 'V' collection is complete now until they come out with a new movie or series.
4,Nostalgic,"It's too fun (and funny) to watch...very enjoyable. The quality of the DVD is fine; no extra features (interviews, extra scenes etc.) provided though. I agree with the other reviews - it would be nice to have the description clearer about it's not including the original mini-series. To get the true complete version, you have to get the 'complete series', the 'original mini series', and the 'final battle' - I read the other reviews, so I knew what to expect."
3,Mostly for Jennifer Cooke,"This series is pretty bad but I give it three stars for Jennifer Cooke. Throughout the nearly endless series of car chases and shoot em ups and fist fights, she at least is nice to look at. Superficial, but at least it's something.The original story of alien domination and the humans' struggle to break free is barely noticeable. And these aliens, who have far more advanced technology seem to be constantly outsmarted. They came here for the water. Well, what's stopping them? Nothing. It's really just poor writing and no imagination.Is it better than the modern V attempt? No, not really. But that series is not very good, either, although it certainly had the actors to pull it off. But not the writing.Stick to the original mini-series of V. Even though it is dated, it's still one of the better stories about alien invasion. And it works."
3,A trip down memory lane more than entertainment,"I was only 8 yrs old when the V TV series aired so I really only have very spotty memories of certain scenes. Purchasing this set was a must for me as I grew up with the original 10 hr mini-series and remember it quite well and fondly.I have to agree with the other reviewers in that I believe the 19 episode TV series started strong but began to sink mid-season and then died on its feet by the end. However, I am glad that I've finally seen this and now know the enitre story (video version at least...as there are numerous books).Still, for fans of the original miniseries it's worth watching at least once if only for a continuation of the story and for nostalgic reasons. For die-hard fans (and they are out there) this is a must have."
5,"Diana is back...errr, not really...but it's GREAT!","This short lived show is now back in public view, with all 26 episodes released on DVD. NBC is updating the storyline next year with a brand new miniseries, so check this box set out before the new series hits air. Relive the events after Liberation Day, the introductions to Lydia, Phillip, Nathan Bates, the unforgetable Mr. Chang, Kyle Bates... and the mystery of the Star Child...."
1,v the minie series,"i kind of disappointed because they did not send the complete series as they metionned on the title, for me this is not completed because they did not add the first episod when the visitors came this is what get me mad because in the cds that they sent to me as the completed series i dont have the first episodes more than 3 to 5 episodes are missing and this is why i am turning the dvd back to amazon because i want the entire thing not half. thank you and i hope someone would read this review and email me back about it or send me the beginning of the completed series like they called it.thank you."
4,V the series comes to dvd,"After purchasing the boxed set of V the series, I must say that the show has not held up well over the years. The special effects are very cheesy compared to today's ,and the dialogue at times is horrific. The weekly verbal catfights between Lydia and Diana get tiresome after the first few episodes, also I was really disappointed that the Ham Tyler character left the show mid-season as he was my favorite character next to Donovan. However I give the series four stars because even with all those things against it, it's still a heckuva lot better than the sci-fi on tv nowadays."
1,Don't be fooled this is not the complete series!,"After purchasing this dvd set I noticed its missing the first episodes and the final battle, I don't understand how they could release this under false pretenses the box says THE COMPLETE SERIES but where is the Mini Series and the Final Battle? This Is just a Lame TV Show if you have never seen V your gonna watch this series wondering what your watching whats going on because nothing is exsplained without the first few episodes you feel like your thrown in this world that doesn't make sense and yes the series makes no sense if you can't watch the first episodes, I would not recommend this because its a true rip off It should Never have been Labeled THE COMPLETE SERIES this was made in an Attempt to fool the consumer into purchasing a horrible tv series or Spin off of the original, i feel like I have been ripped off. If I could give this 0 Stars I would"
3,"the final episode, The Return","In the final episode, there are too many mini-plots for one hour, and makes it seem like 5 hours. Maybe some will enjoy that, I didn't.But I'm a V fan, so I got all 3 dvd's and I hope they make a new movie."
2,not wath i taught it would be,"i watch the seris back in the day when it came out.I was really young andrememberd being scared but this time around, 20 years latter, i got to saythat it is not as scary as i rememeberd.Very very slow, effex ar not that bad but to slow for me."
3,Rush job,"The concert was okay, but many of their best songs weren't played: Victim of Changes, Ripper, Tyrant, etc. The Screaming for Vengeance DVD (check Ebay) was WAY better. I personally don't like their radio friendly songs from Turbo or Ram it Down. Judas Priest should never have made videos. For such a great band, the videos (except Painkiller, which was EXCELLENT) came off as silly- SO bad that they weren't even good. Add a flimsy inner jacket and you get a package that seems like a half hazard rush job. Let's hope they put out a DVD of their Ozzfest tour (with Slayer). That would be truly great!"
5,Back When Metal Concerts Cost More to Produce Than Movies...,"The Hellion plays. A gigantic robot that looks like it could take on the Japanese Defense Force slowly emerges from out of the stage floor. Rob Halford steps back ito its waiting claw, and is lifted high off the stage as he performs Electric Eye, all while the robot sweeps the audience with a menacing spotlight from its visor.This wasn't a concert, this was entertainment taken to such gloriously insane excess that has regretfully never been duplicated. These guys actually made Spinal Tap, an over-the-top parody of metal bands, seem conservative by comparison. If this DVD had that concert alone, it would be worth it, but a collection of music videos, including the hillarious Locked In and Turbo Lover, and four live BBC performances make it a very solid buy for anyone who wants to see the greatest live act in metal history at the hight of its stadium-filling glory."
5,"One Word "" AWESOME!!! ""...",This DVD is simply AWESOME!!!...If you are a true Priest fan then this is a MUST buy for your collection!...There is no better of a guitar duo than Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing...The Spiney leads and raging power chords are synchronized to perfection...Rob Halford's voice is impeccable!...There is no BS about the videography...It's a LIVE concert at it's best!...It desreves more than 5 stars!...You will NOT be disappointed!...
2,Bad decision....,"It would have been better to have the Live In Memphis video inserted here, instead of the atrocious Priest...Live, that was recorded during their ""hair-metal"" phase, and it's a disgrace, with the guys dressed like Poison or Ratt or Motley Crue, Halford staring at the cameras all the time, the camera going to film chicks at the audience (some of them clearly not at the concert) all the time... Live in Memphis, recorded during the Scremaing For vengeance Tour, is the opposite: it has the band at their most hard sound ever, delivering classic after classic with energy and vibration.The rarities are fine.All in all, for such a low price, it's a good thing to buy."
2,Nothing I haven't seen before,"I'm disappointed in this DVD. It's a combo of JP live and fuel for fire. The video quality is real bad very bleached out and extremely choppy. I have both JP live and Fuel For Fire on Video tape and they are a nicer copy. Had I known I would not have bought it. It's a real shame, I love the Priest I have all their albums including the ""ripper"" Albums without Rob."
3,Still Metal Kings!,Judas Priest will always be the kings of metal. My Screaming for Vengance CD is one of my favorite of all-time. The audio on Electric Eye doesn't come close to the CD in any of the surround modes. Not sure if this is a problem with my copy or the way this disc was mastered. But the videos are great for any Priest fan.
3,"Extraordinary performer, Average performance","Let me state my bias upfront - I am an unabashed Sammy Davis fan. If you are like me and collect all things Sammy, buy this DVD. If you are new to Sammy and are wondering what his live performances were like, this DVD is not a good example. One of Sammy's best qualities as a performer was his ability to connect with his audience. On this night his performance was always a beat behind. He seemed to be trying too hard. Now, I repeat if you are a Sammy fan and have seen him perform a number of times - watching the wheels turn as he tries to ""get"" his audience is interesting and might give you added insight, but if you are new to him this performance looks lackluster."
5,the best of Sammy Davis jr. Live,This is really a great dvd. Makes you feel really happy when you are watching it. My husband was so happy to recieve this for Christmas.
5,Can punk rock get any better than this?,"Last years youth really look the part and sound the part. With the look of todays punk with the gritty sound of past punks. Lots of great lyrics with humour and a serious touch. It is obvious that they are a punk's punk band, having little doubt in what they believe in."
5,A must read book,Any one that want to understand the mind control process should read this book.AMORC Unmasked: The hidden mind control techniques of the Rosicrucian order
2,Review of Recovery from Cults,"I just couldn't get into it, and I did try. It didn't relate to anything I was familiar with.I thought I ordered ""Combatting Cult Mind Control"" by Steven Hassan. I had read the book before and even gave it to a friend."
4,Help yourself heal,"A cult can be a group or just one person. If you are a person who is recovering from a ""controlling relationship"" or an actual cult, this is a great resource. The book helps break down into digestible chunks the tools you need in order to gain insight for your own situation. It helps the survivor (or loved one of a survivor) navigate through the healing process and also explains how controlling groups/individuals operate. The book explains how even the brightest of individuals can be manipulated by factions or persons that do not have your best interest at heart. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has or does suffer from any type of cultish abuse/mind control/spiritual abuse, etc. Healing is a process and this book should be in every survivors healing arsenal."
4,Happy are the Oppressed,"I Have just discovered Andrew Greeley and I am busy devouring everything I can get my hands on. I throughley enjoyed the book, I thought it was interesting and informative, it kept me on the edge of my seat."
3,the ice princess,"Yes, Andrew Greeley once again finds a way to make me look at my fellow creatures quite differently than my socialized prejudices. Who would think that a beautiful billionaire wife who works our daily with her personal trainer is actually oppressed by her mother-in-law and in need of Father Blackie's immediate attention to prevent her murder? I did not figure out the culprit until the end -- a sign of an able mystery! I read the book in two days, because I wanted to know who did it! Worth your time. :-)"
2,HE'S WRITTEN BETTER!!!,"Hated the history lesson. One whole chapter of letters irritated me to no end. I almost fell asleep on the treadmill. I did finish it, because I just can't buy a book and not read it. The final chapters are what made me rate it a 3. They were OK but uninspired and not very creative"
3,His reach exceedeth his grasp,"Father Greeley's meager literary talents are strained past the breaking point in his attempt to recreate the voice of a nineteenth century Irish servant girl. Never would she have used the English language the way this author makes her write. Unfortunately, her hard-to-believe ""letters"" are a very large part of the book. However, I found the Chicago history bit fascinating, and the book as a whole is a good sentimental yarn with a (for me) hard-to-guess denouement and lots of tongue-in-cheek Irish blarney. And Auxiliary Bishop Blackie Ryan is a treasure!"
5,Good smelling scent!,"All I can say is I order this stuff often! I love it, my sister loves it and my niece loves it! The one I get from Amazon is great. I will be placing another order in about a month!"
1,Not so new,"Although the book was in good shape and anybody wishing to read it would have no problems going through it, there were a couple of things that went over the line. First, it had library numbers and names stamped on pages and, even worse, on the side of the pages in a way that was impossible to erase. Second, the cover was very worn out which is fine if you want to read it on your own but looks terrible if you want to give it to someone as a gift. Overall, the book just looked as if the people at the library in Queens (NYC) just wanted to get rid of a very old worn out book and failed to accurately mention the state that the book was in in the description provided by amazon."
1,Theos Oddysey,"In short, this book is an awful joke. It is informative, but so is an encyclopedia. Theo is not a teenager- he is the worst portrayed character in the last year, and the computer game aspect is tacked on. This book starts off ludicrously poor and continues as we nod off, gently. It is NOT a novel. Buy an encyclopedia instead."
1,Is this a book?,"I still haven't read this cos it is too boring. I'll make this review short, mainly cos there is nothing to say about it.Don't read it, it is awful!"
2,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed at what I had hoped would be an insightful and entertaining spiritual journey. Instead, this attempt to categorize and explain the tenets and history of the world's religion fails utterly. Full of oversimplifications, factual errors and unintelligible translations, I felt misled by the numerous comparisons to the far superior Sophie's World on the book jacket."
5,Loved the book.,"Theo's Odyssey was a wonderful book. The critics who feel the tenents of each religion were not exactly as they have researched/read/been taught should go on to something more scholarly that would best utilize their, obviously, stellar intellect. For the rest of us, who enjoy a good read while learning about people passionate about their chosen religions, it was most informative in a imaginatively-written manner. To me, it showed how all of us believe so differently but so much the same upon closer inspection. Certainly tolerance of each other's beliefs was what I came away with after reading this book. To each their own, but I would recommend this book. I read this book twice -- something I've never done before."
5,Made complications simple,This is the only easy to undersatand and motivational guide to starting a small business in Canada. It is full of extreamly valuable resources those will enable you to overcome all of bottlenecks in starting and managing your own business including marketing strategies.
3,Too short.....camera angles not the best,"My girlfriend loves to salsa and dance, in general. I purchased this hoping to improve my skills and I found it very limiting given the camera angles that were utilized. I think most of this is a function of the EXTREMELY small studio in which he recorded the video in. With a bigger studio better camera angles could be obtained and more footwork and body movement could have been captured in sync. With this video you get footwork or body movement but never the two together when he is attempting to teach the students, which is extremely annoying."
4,Baskteball Mayhem,The simplicity to understand the techniques from this basketball guide is second to none. Its apparent that your skills will be refined by the ultimate simplicity of the drills... I love this book!
3,just the facts - unfortunately,"While Marquis seems to cover all the surface facts, she fails to give us a look into the theories that made Greenberg so important. And her concern with Greenberg's reputation appears slanted; for example, the controversy surrounding Greenberg's stripping the paint off the late David Smith's sculpture is defended and his detractors are summarily dismissed. It made me curious to read Rubenfeld's biography, though better yet would be to get Greenberg's Art and Culture and read what the man himself had to say."
2,Pathetic,A amateurish and useless read. Reads like a undergraduate paper and has the tone of a rank outsider peering into the grown up intellectual world. Pass on it.
2,Inclement,"This book may be enjoyed by those deeply interested in modern art as practiced in New York in the 1940s through 60s. However, if you have only time to read one recent book on this era, buy Jed Perl's New Art City.Art Czar is about Clement Greenberg's life. Which in sum was a pathetic mess from childhood to death. He is not a noble person to read about and the fact he was a noted art critic fifty years ago does not vault him into the status of being interesting. At least not for me, and I would wager most people.The writing style of the author is basic. It certainly does not save the book from its subject."
2,AV by Adrienne Vittadini For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3 ounces,Not the fragrance I thought it would be. This is the reason I don't like buying online. I prefer to shop in person.
5,A beautiful fragrance,"This fragrance is without a doubt the cleanest and most pleasant smelling fragrance I have ever used. I read somewhere that it was being discontinued and I can't imagine why! Is it because not enough people are buying the fragrance? Please give second thoughts to doing away with this most beautiful fragrant perfume. It would be well worth your while to promote it again and continue issuing this lovely, sweet smelling perfume and pay attention to the people that really want it to be continued as I feel you would make a fortune just considering that aspect alone. Rose Marie"
4,nice job,"this is a very infomative and enlightening book. the descriptions are vivid and thought provoking and should supply the reader with many visions of mysterious Alaska. I found some sections dregged, but overall the subjects were interesting and engaging."
1,"Unfortunately, Fame Off-Broadway does not suceed","After seeing Fame on 42nd Street for free, I was very disappointed after having left the theatre. While there may be vocal talent in the show, the book itself fails. The lyrics are not clever (""I'm alive, I will survive""... come on folks) and the dialogue was painful to listen to. I think my favorite line was, ""Was that really necessary?"" reponse: ""Only time will tell..."" There are better CDs and better musicals to see out there, don't waste your money or your time."
4,Great for the Beginning Art Student,"This is a great book for the beginning art student. It teaches the reader: context, visual elements, composition and criticism, two/three-demensional media, architectural media, images of nature, nudes in western art, images in faith, images in America, the modern movement, early and late twentieth century art. This book breaksdown all of those subjects for the beginning art student. If you would like to learn about art this is the book for you."
2,"""Hothead"" is accurate","While I enjoyed the author's wit and writing style, I found ""Orchids in the Arctic"" to be decidedly and unessesarily male-bashing in nature. Being called a militant feminist myself, even I found her commentary to be a bit harsh. All men are domineering and have been taught from birth to hate and subordinate women to a certain degree? Not quite. Most, yes, but not all. I had to put the book down occasionally because of this, and that cuts off a few stars. I appreciate her ideas, but the false generalizations she shows toward men give true feminists a bad name. The entire premise of feminism is that women are (and should be represented as) equal to men. Man-hating is just as bad a woman-hating and gets us nowhere."
4,Good business book.,A very good book for anyone who even slightly interested in the economy and want to understand their business.I would recommend.
4,Essential reading for junior hires,"There are way more non-CEOs than CEOs, and considering that the CEO doesn't have the time to explain it all, this book distills the basics. It is concise and clear, using everyday examples such as apple-vendors and shoe-vendors. I wish I had received this when I was starting out. (If you're an accountant, you may not need this book.)"
2,Overly simplified and not helpful,"I purchased this after reading rave reviews as well as the recommendation by my company and was very disappointed. Even though I have a BA in Business, I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to learn. However, I was disappointed at how much Charan oversimplified some basic terms and didn't even give a thorough defintion of ""velocity"" -- one of his key points. I read in just a few hours and am giving to goodwill -- one of the few books I won't put in my home library."
1,Dangerously Oversimplified and Misleading,"This is the first book I've picked from the ChangeThis ""Personal MBA"" list (http://www.changethis.com/17.PersonalMBA) and boy am I disappointed.I thought this primer-level introduction to business would give me the tools I needed to understand the nuts & bolts of Collins and Lazier's *Running the Small to Mid-Sized Business* but no such luck.He gives us a taste of the math that is required to understand business, but I guess he's afraid of scaring people off with too much math, because it's glossed over in such a way as to be unusable. It's like sex without penetration.And right now I'm reading a section where he says, ""Obviously, the higher the P-E multiple, the more wealth is created.""By that logic, all those overvalued internet stocks during the dot com bubble created a lot of wealth. And so did Enron.I hope the other books on the ""Personal MBA"" list are better than this."
4,"An insightful, simple read on many company issues","Ram Charan, the author, clearly and simply states the financial factors that influence a company's success. He emphasizes a person's ability to take the chaotic mess of financial data and break it into digestible, relevant chunks of knowledge through which a ""leader"" can make precise and informed financial decisions.He dedicates a small, but captivating, portion of the book on creating sychrnocity between people within a team, which I feel is a strong driving force behind a company's success.Overall, I was quite pleased with this book. It address many issues for an individual who isn't financially-oriented. I suggest reading ""Douglas McGregor: Revisited"" for further analysis on how to work with people in a team environment."
1,What the CEO Wants You To Know: How Your Company Really Works,"Not happy. Book in terrible condition and since it was a gift, had to write a letter of apology to the recipient. Unsolicited, the Company said it was sending a free better copy of this book. Have yet to receive it. Again, not happy with this transaction."
3,doesn't live up to the title.,"The most brilliant thing about this extremely slim volume is it's title. Any ambitious person in a corporate setting will want what the book promises. Unfortunately, the promise is not fulfilled.One problem is the book is most applicable to retail or manufacturing. The central insight of the book deals with inventory turnover. That may be fine for Dell Computers, but CEOs of companies that develop software don't care about inventory, because there is none. The entire service/information economy is more or less ignored.Overall I found the book interesting and worthwhile. But if you strip away the folksy tales about fruit vendors in the third world and anecdotes about the CEO of Ford, what you have left is a short pamphlet.I would guess this book contains information my CEO would probably would want me to know. But I am pretty sure my CEO would want me to know a whole lot more than whats in this book."
5,My Kindergarten Class Loved This Book!,I teach children of kindergarten age and younger and they all LOVED this book! After I read it they begged me to read it again! The ending made me and another teacher laugh out loud. Fun story!
2,"........ BLAND, dead-letter postcards ...........","This one's more or less ""music by numbers"", a good introduction to the work for the very, very young, or if you're very bored, zap this on the bigscreen, get into the kitchen and whip up a batch of blintzes, in other words : good background music.The AUDIO quality is excellent [cannot fault that] but the visuals are not well edited [just plain old boring stuff, sunsets, museum shots, people and more people] - this is Ken Russell territory or even Elias E. Merhige, so get with it folks - blow our minds with some REAL images!"
2,Wrong pictures.,"I coulnd't care less for all that totally irrelevant scenery. What I would like to see is the orchestra and the conductor, like in the wonderful recording of Tchaikovsky's Fifth with Tshernuschenko and the St. Petersburg Orchestra."
5,Well made quality product,We bought a pair of these Lite Source Lamppost Outdoor Wall Lamp for our home in South Florida and have had no issues with them for 6 months now. They look as good today as they did when we took them out of the box. Worth the money for the quality they offer.
5,The most addicting snacks ever,"If you've never had Tings, you're missing out on one of the greatest culinary experiences known to humankind. Okay, so maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but they definitely do for vegans what those Cheeto things do for dairy-eating folks. The nutritional yeast doesn't exactly make them taste cheesey; rather, they taste like what I imagine Cheetos taste like under all of that coating. Delicious though, and EXTREMELY addicting! I have been known to consume an entire package in one sitting, so if you're on a diet watch out as they are certainly not a low calorie food."
3,"Yummy, but have cross-contamination issues for GFCF diet","These are really yummy, and the ingredients are gluten-free, casein-free, and soy-free (GFCF/GFCFSF). However, I talked to the company, and there is a risk for cross-contamination with gluten, casein, and soy. If your kids seems to like Tings a little *too* much (as in addicted or continually asking for more), you might want to consider cross-contamination issues.[...]"
3,"Good, but too salty ...","I'm not some kind of anti-salt freak, but these were too salty to be really enjoyable. Good, yes - but make sure you have lots of water/adult beverages to help with these. I'll be sticking to Veggie Booty for my son."
1,rancid product,"I love these, but you would be better to buy from the company its self. I ordered a case and they were all rancid. So 24 bags of waste. Non returnable product. I am sure if you got these from roberts they would send you replacement but NOT AMAZON!!! Who know maybe amazon gets all the crappy batches. Buy a case from whole foods at least they will return them for you"
1,So/so,"My teenage son thought this was awful, so I took them into work. The reaction at work was lukewarm. I don't eat junk food, so I didn't try them - just going on the reactions of my son and co-workers."
2,Very Little Stripper Action or Werewolf Action,"After liking and enjoying both Zombie Strippers and Zombies vs. Strippers, I expected the same kind of entertainment value from Strippers vs. Werewolves. Boy, was I disappointed. The only cool thing about Strippers vs. Werewolves is its title. The nudity is minimal, the werewolf makeup is horrible, and the action is almost non-existant. Even the cameo from Robert Englund is dull. There are much better movies about strippers and much better movies about werewolves than this, so see those instead."
2,Mostly boring,About 45 minutes in I was starting to almost want to fall asleep & I only started watching it at 5:00. That's not good at all. Once Robert Englund showed up the movie got better. It seems like they only had maybe an hours worth of decent material & stretched that out to 90 minutes. I actually did like the ending. The Werewolves were plain disappointing looking. Think Hugh Jackman as Wolverine only a little messier with fangs. I say it's a rental at best. Strippers vs. Zombies was no prize movie but it has this beat.
3,Its ok to watch strippers,Ok not great.A rainy day event. Watch it free on netflix for free that way if you get angry with yourself you havent lost any money.Great looking strippers!!
3,Not for the intense sportsfan,"Fans of ""Schott's Original Miscellany"" may think of this as a potential gift for the sportsfan in their life, but it does not carry enough detail for the typical sportsfan, in part because in its strenuous effort to be both broad and flippant it extends its scope to crossword puzzles, quizzes, and the like...so it's great on the miscellany dimensions and scant on the sports. But if you are satisfied to know a single set of trivial details about cricket and one about polo and one about [whatever], this might be ok for you.If on the other hand, you're not a sportsfan but are merely looking for more Schott's like reading material, I recommend instead the ""Companion"" series, which show every sign of being issued by the same publisher (same size format, typeface, etc.) althoug they are from Robson books rather than Bloomsbury. Examples includes ""The London Companion,"" ""The Literary Companion,"" ""The Gardener's Companion,"" etc."
3,pros and cons,"My feelings on this title are mixed. It is well written and organized. The idea is interesting (basically an rpg version of the Men in Black movie). It has very limited usefulness in any other type of campaign. The characters are very powerful (700 points). They do not cross well and are sort of hard to handle for a GM. Buy this is you loved Men in Black, but otherwise I would reccomend gurps illuminati."
4,The good stuff!,"This book is a wonderful collection of rules for playing high-powered characters combined with a nightmarish conspiracy theory that makes just a little too much sense for my comfort.Although gamers may not want to play in the world presented by the book (it's HARD playing a character with that many skills and advantages), GM's can dredge the well-constructed world for inspiration in other settings and use the many short-cut rules for keeping their own high-point campaigns running smoothly."
1,I think the other reviews are based on the free preview...,"I've *actually* read the entire book and it's a peice of trash, I actually threw it away it disgusted me so much. The author said that if you don't tell people you're pregnant your baby will think he/she is not wanted and you can miscarry because of that! Unbelievably ignorant, this author has obviously never dealt with miscarriage or infertility. I picked up this book thinking it would have natural remedies(you know like herbs) and it's a lot of meditations and visualizations which is fine and good for anyone trying to conceive but with infertility I don't care how many times I pray to buddah it's just not going to happen without a doctor's help. Don't waste your time on the rest of the book, it's not worth it and they wouldn't give a huge preview if it was"
2,"Flimsy, too lightweight","I ordered two of these for my wife for Christmas. But when they arrived, she was disappointed that they weren't heavier, thicker glass. So I returned them."
1,hairgrowth,"Please do not waste your money on this product. Did not do anything at all to my hair. Bought couple of bottles and used for couple of months hoping my hair hair would grow faster and longer. You can buy cheaper product from drugstore. Will not buy this product again, just wast of money"
3,F.A.S.T Review,Hey guys! So I have a YouTube account and I am currently testing out the product by Nisim. I will have monthly video updates and will only tell you the truth and only the truth. Please check out my channel with the link below and I hope to see you there!And thank you to all of you who have seen my videos it means a lot to me :)--MadeleineP.S: Please remember that more videos will be on the way for this product so stay tuned and don't forget to subscribe![...]~~Thanks guys!!~~
3,"Not too bad, just what I need.","This book is NOT too bad at all. I disgree with some of the comments that other people have put in, this book got what I need for programming perl, not too much, not too little."
2,"Potentially useful, but muddled presentation","This book claims to be about Perl programming on NT, but is short on NT specifics. Many of the Perl scripts start with the UNIX shell idiom of ""#!/usr/local/perl"", even though this is ignored on NT. Various concepts are used before being explained, or even defined. One gets the impression that a bunch of UNIX Perl info had some sections about NT stapled on. The book is short on info about configuring web servers on NT, and also has no examples of advanced functions such as ""system()"" which were critical to the project I was doing on NT. If you're new to Perl, there are better introductions than the first third of this book. If you know Perl CGI on UNIX it'll be hard to dig out the info you need to transfer that knowledge to NT. I guess an NT webmaster who knows nothing about Perl is the best market for this book"
5,we Ballin!!!!!!!!!!,this was one of the cuts last year. it caught on every year. doing the Jim Jones dance at the club at Sports Stadiums and whatnot was the IN thing to be doing last year. this re mix is tight as well. this cut is still a Banger.
4,Dead Boys - 'Liver Than You'll Ever Be' (Pilot),"About as good as their 'Night Of The Living Dead Boys' live release(see my review).'Liver...' was recorded at the Ritz in New York City on December 26,1987 on a brief reunion tour,I assume.Can see that vocalist Stiv Bator(R.I.P.)produced the record.As for live albums go,the sound is a bit rough but I doubt many fans would be disappointed with the mix of this CD.Tunes I liked hearing the most were ""I Wanna Be A Dead Boy"",""Ain't Nothin' To Do"",the slamming ""Son Of Sam"",their Stooges cover ""Search And Destroy"",their Stones cover ""Tell Me"" and ""3rd Generation Nation"".The line-up here is:Bator-vocals,Cheetah Chrome-guitar,Jimmy Zero-rhythm guitar and Johnny Blitz-drums.What,no bass player?Sort of found it amusing toward the end of the set,when a couple of the band members were telling one another off SINCE this was the final gig of the tour anyway.Great all-American punk."
2,"Good music, but horribly recorded....","I like the Dead Boys music - alot... I realize that this music is not meant to be recorded clean... The grittier the better in my opinion... This is a band that usually sounds better live than recorded...But.... This live album was really horribly recorded... It sounds as if it was recorded behind a loud fan (the cooling one, not someone who likes the band).. The sound cuts in and out very quickly (talk into a fan, and it sounds like what comes out the other end)Also, their was large feedback ""shrieks"" that really should have been minimized in the editing room...As much as I like their music, i had to turn this one off within 3 songs..."
1,"bad, very bad","Now let me just mention i love the dead boys, and i love every band Stiv has been in. but this cd is just plain bad. the audio of the audience is the same thing looped over and over again and sometimes during solos the sound of the audience over powers the sound of the guitar. thats pretty much what killed it for me. other than the audience i can deal with the quality, but i havent listened to this since the first time i bought it and i really never want to listen to it. stick with the studio stuff in my opinion."
1,Not simple,"I'm six years old and I'm in first grade. I found this Super Simple Origami book in the first grade section of the library at my school. The title said super simple origami. It was not simple at all! It was too hard. Never buy or borrow this book.From the mom: I helped my son type this review. He was so excited to try out folding, and got so frustrated. We tried several of the designs. I will also be speaking to the librarian about a more appropriate section for the book. Unfortunately, the school only goes up to fourth grade."
1,are the other reviewers on crack?,"OK- I am very new to Origami,and need detailed instructions in ENGLISH. I did not find this book to be super simple as the title promised. The book uses the complicated origami language throughout. If you do not understand the international origami code, then you will find this book to be super difficult."
3,scary little man but leprechuan i think not,this was one ugly little marionette buyer beware it will scare any child ha ha ha seriously. bought him to place in my st patricks day window display ugliest little thing ever he sits on a shelf an glares at anyone entering the room. opted not to put him in the window made rainbow an pot of gold by hand instead. couldn't even give him away but didn't have the heart to toss him in the trash.
2,so so,"I have an earlier model of this and I sincerely hope that it has been greatly improved upon since that one was made.I took it to work and was shocked that the battery was low after 3 hours. So much for using it on a long flight.The headphone jack loosened and ultimately caused the unit to take up residence in a drawer.It was a great device for the few hours that it ran per charge, but I expect longer battery life from something like this."
5,High Sierra Envoy Lumbar Pack,"The fanny pack has the most storage space for what I need to carry. It has room for both my phones, wallet, checkbook, key ring. It arrived fast!"
3,Really Big.,"I rec'd this Fanny Pack super fast & it's really big. I can't seem to get it to sit right around my waist. It's almost like carrying a samll suitcase around the waist, it's so big. I can't get it to lay flat on my stomach & I've tried adjusting it. If you want really big, this may be what you're looking for, but if you're expecting a normal size, this is much too big."
1,defective,This pack arrived with a faulty zipper. After wearing the pack for just one day the zipper came out of alignment and it was clear that the teeth that the zipper attached to were defective.
4,Spacious as in Space Shuttle!,"This bag is amazingly spacious. I put all what I need on the move in it and still have space for more. It may be a bit too big but that's the normal trade off. It can be, though, a bit smaller or at least re-sizable to fit different situations.Furthermore, the build is good, and the headphone tract is a nice idea.Overall, a very good product."
4,Not water proofed,"I think there are already a lot of pros/cons reviews, which I agree. The only complaint I have is that it's not water proofed."
2,Feels So...Aiight.....,"Well Atomic Kiten do a good job on their sophomore release. It has an 80's feel to it though. but the album has some true gems on it...in my opinion they are:1) It's OK! - cute guitar and violin piece about a break-up4) Feels So Good - the title track about just livin it up and havin fun7) The Last Goodbye - great song about the one u love not being there9) Softer the Touch - 80's song that just gets downright nasty!!12) So Hot - my absolute fave track, a dance track with a Kylie minogue flava(she wrote it), just good 2 groove to14) No One Loves You Like i Love You - beuatiful balladthe album is aiight..give it a spin"
2,Shatered CD,"This is great CD except for one problem. It made from some new environmentlyfriendly plastic. Well I live in climate were the night time temperature was5 degrees F. The CD was in my car so I could play it in the car. The Atomic KittenCD cracked around the spindle, and lator shatered.I have never had an American type plastic CD crack like this.CD sounded good, but I did not like the new form of plastic.To get around the copy right encription. Play the CD into your computer. Usethe audio in jack. Then you can burn one unencripted copy for use with yourIpods or other devices.Thanks"
3,"i love the kittens, but...","...this cd is a bit of a disapointment. gone are the refreshing teen romps and heartfelt pop dramas of their last release, ""right now""-replaced instead with middle of the road, please both mum and the kids type fair. ""it's okay"" comes closest to matching ""whole again's"" charm, with ""the last goodbye"" coming in a close second. ""baby don't you hurt me"" is suprisingly infectious with it's madonna/niles rodgers era groove. the rest of the songs, i must say, lack any true personality of their own. if you love the kittens, of course you should buy this cd, but if you are unfamiliar with the trio, but intriqued, purchase ""right now."""
4,You should be buying,"I really enjoy this book, it helps with my spinal pain and other assorted small pains around the body. It's really helpful for me, not having to waste money on massages and ciropractors, also, megadeth is better than Metallica."
4,Very useful,"This book was very useful in helping me treat my right rotator cuff shoulder pain and impingement. The basic premise is to massage all the tender areas in and around and in the vicinity of the sore joint. It took close to 2 months to get rid of the pain after suffering fo 20 months. The diagrams are great and helpful. This is not how you treat a complete tear of the rotator cuff, but is effective for inflammations and impingement. You need to work hard and be obsessive about persevering with this treatment until it's done. In other words, it's hard work, but definitely worth it. I only used it for my right shoulder, but I'm sure it can work for other joint and muscle pain as well.. Make sure to consult a health care professional about your diagnosis before you proceed, so you don't treat an acute surgical condition with massage. The availability in digital format was helpful in doing the treatment while away from home."
5,Well researched!,"This is a work of fine research into the intricate anatomy of our trigger points that affect our health. Without compromising the physical descriptions, it allows a less sofisticated reader the ability to find problems to that can be alleviated with its instructions - with a happy result."
3,Trigger Point Therapy (blue book) is better!,I purchased this book first and still couldn't seem to get rid of soreness in my legs. I went online and found the blue Trigger Point Therapy book and was able to resolve the problems immediately. This book is hard to follow and the diagrams are not that good. The blue Trigger Point book is much better.Clair Davies is the author of the other book.Update: The best Trigger Point book is The Trigger oint Therapy Workbook by Clair Davies.
1,VERY IMPRESSED WITH THEMSELVES,This is an excellent book for anyone in sales (as far as the authors are concerned) Then again they did manage to convince me to buy it! I've been in sales for more than ten years and have attended some of the best seminars in the company at my employers expense. I get the impression the only research these two did was attend a few seminars and take tape recorders. There is not one original idea in this book....I'm not sure what planet they think this concept is succesful on but it is not earth....
1,This book should come with crayons.,"For a couple of purported ""pros,"" Cody and Harte certainly have assembled a collection of facile, redundant, patronizing and almost completely irrelevant advice for the business professional. Read it for entertainment purposes only. Don't quit your day jobs, guys."
5,For Anyone in Sales...,"Wow! This is an excellent book for anyone in sales or anyone thinking about going into sales! I've been in sales for more than five years, and the last two years have been very rough for everyone in this industry. This book provides the tools and strategies you need to gain your confidence back as a salesperson and teaches you how to be successful again in sales. This book is a MUST! It's also a great and quick read!"
2,Dissppointed for the Fourth Edition,"If you have a third edition, you should keep using it. I should have kept the $ in my pockey. :(The newly added Class-D chapter is rather short and trivial. It is just an introduction to Class-D concept. This can be found easily elsewhere. No research, experimental and test results! Disappointed! Has the author listened to current high performance Class-D solutions (like ICEpower, Hypex)?The other new chapter, DC servo, does contains test/new results. You will learn some useful techniques.The author should correct some problems (printing, inconsistency between text and figure) that exist in third or earlier editions. However, he didn't. Why?Lastly, it is still highly recommeded for new readers."
3,Good Book - Bad printing,"I had previously read this book at the library and it was excellent. Even the smallest details could be read. This print has a problem with any drawings that have been scanned in. The following pages have problems: 77, 116-118, 179, 194, 332.Doug Self is a true audio genius."
4,Audio Power Amp Book,"This book is a complement for a previous one also bought from Amazon. Very interesting, a lot of information compiled in a comprehensive text. Not too much mathematics, it is practical. A book to have as reference for Audio design or DIY. I recommend."
5,Good Stuff,"I've been a John Foxx fan since '82, and this CD is one of my favorites. It has a good electronic feel with good rhythms and vocals."
2,Pessimistic view of M.L.K. Jr.,"Sure, as the other viewers pointed out, this movie does indeed provide some insight into the personal life of King and it shows a side of him that we aren't really familiar with. The problem is that this is the only material shown about King. It's always a sad story or a pathetic reality about him. Rarely do these people emphasize what actually made the man decent, instead they focus exclusively on what his personal problems were. To me this movie honestly seemed more like an E! Hollywood Story rather than a balanced biography. I don't recommend this movie to anyone with a serious interest in learning about the life of King as the only new [to the general public-revealing]information provided here can be summed up in a few statements: -He admitted he may have slept around -He used to be saturated with pride and insecurity during his 20's -He was imperfect."
4,Mozart & Salzburg A Magical Journey,"A Quick review of a disc that I thought was very enjoyable. You can't go wrong with a Mozart piano concerto and with 2 here, winners! The performances were very credible and delightful! What took me away was Salzburg! If I were to want to visit anywhere in Europe, this disc makes me want Salzburg! Summer looks quite delightful, but winter looks like a wonderland! The scenery chosen is quite breathtaking in it's scope. I am glad to have this disc in my library!Great performance and great scenery, what more can one ask???"
2,Sort of Interesting,"A book telling of the battle from the Confederate side. Some bits of it are interesting, for instance it dispels the myth that there was a wide disparity in the quality of the armaments of the two sides.However the focus on the confederate operations to the exclusion of those of the northern army makes it difficult to understand the total action. The author also continually refers to Beauregard as the ""Creole"" rather than by his name. This is somewhat bizarre. Still easy enought to read but not one of the life changing my god I now understand it all books."
1,Serious Shiloh battle readers should look elsewhere,"This was, without a doubt, the most difficult book to read, not only on the Civil War but on any topic. The writer is extremely dis-jointed and each paragraph makes so many referrels to individuals and battle locations that the reader has no idea as to whether the individuals are members of the North or South. Names are injected that have no previous references. The maps, or lack thereof, only complicate the reading. There is no doubt the writer knows his Shiloh history, unfortunately, knowing it and being able to convey the knowledge in writing is certainly lacking. There are so many other texts available that make the battle of Shiloh interesting and easy to follow and enjoyable. This book was a struggle and certainly not enjoyable to read. Many photographs included were taken 30 -40 years after the battle. Not sure of the reason for that. I would suggest this book be a read only if no other book on Shiloh can be found."
4,Excellent history of crucial battle,"This is one of the best Civil War books I've read in a while. I visited the battlefield for the first time shortly after reading this, and the book gave me a great sense of the lay of the land and movements of the armies. Daniel does a great job of putting the battle into the political context of April 1862, and then goes on to provide an excellent military history of the battle. It would be a 5-star book if he had returned at the end to discuss its ramifications to a greater degree."
5,Golden Book of Fairy Tales,"Generous illustrations and an excellent translation to English make this collection a superior value. The language preserves the ""mystique"" of ""once upon a time"" while remaining accessible to young people.Dave Smola, Reading SpecialistThe Golden Book of Fairy Tales (Golden Classics)"
5,A reissued classic,"How grateful I was, in the 1990s, to find that this gem of a children's book had been reissued. I first encountered the large-format volume as a child in the 1960s, and remember being thrilled by the lush yet sensitive illustrations, as well as by the wonderful retelling of these charming fairly tales--among them French, Russian, and Japanese classics. The illustrations by Adrienne Segur, some in color, others in pencil, are remarkable for their beauty and rich detail. If the exquisitely large-eyed, soulful faces of her fairy-tale heroines are primarily drawn from the same mold, the other elements of the paintings and drawings are unique to the stories being told.I highly recommend this lovely book for children of 6 or 7 years and older. The wealth of text might be difficult for a beginning reader to deal with."
5,Fairy Tales from childhood,"I had a copy of this book of fairy tales when I was a child. It looked a bit different than this new version-but it was large and lavender on the cover. I LOVED this book! The pictures were beautifully illustrated and kind of ""other worldly"". I have remebered the stories since I was little. My brother loaned it to another little friend and we never got it back! I was so pleased to have found it again!"
5,Beautiful Book!,"My mother had a copy of this book when she was little, and all of my cousins and my brothers grew up on it. Before I could read, I remember carefully looking through the pictures every time I went to my grandmother's house. We had to be careful, because the cover was falling off and some of the pages were coming out.My grandmother had it rebound for me for Christmas when I was 12, so I could enjoy it more. I never get tired of reading the old world styled fairy tales, or looking at the pictures. It's one of the main reasons I grew up wanting to become an artist. And own a borzoi, since a lot of the dogs in the book have a distinctly borzoi look.Everyone who enjoys fairy tales even the slightest bit should own this book."
5,Well-rounded collection of classic stories,"While the whole quality of the book is great -- printed in Italy, good binding, large type, heavy paper -- my favorite aspect is the broad variety of stories in the collection. Fairy tales from all over the world, representing many different cultures (though primarily European and Japanese), gives it a great well-considered ""best of"" quality to it. No doubt you can think of some stories that have been left out, but whatever might not have been included, this book doesn't suffer because of it.I have absolutely no complaints about this book."
3,Wouldn't recommend for younger children,I bought this book after reading all the positive reviews. It is a good book and I would recommend it for older children but I found the stories to be too complicated for my 4yr old to follow. These stories are closer to the original versions of famous fairy tales. They do not have tidy 'happy ever after' endings which causes lots of questions and confusion in smaller kids. Older kids can better understand the more complicated plots (i.e. a king attempts to force his daughter to marry him so he can have a son) and somewhat gruesome aspects (in one story the evil mother in law plans to eat her daughter in law and children).
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"This book was a disappoinment. Not every page has illustrations. Some pictures are in black and white. The book is oversized in regards to height and width, but is not very thick.I found a different book at Ross called ""Once Upon a Time"", which has more stories and colorful illustrations on every page. It has a princess sitting and reading with a large, textured dragon on the cover.http://www.amazon.com/Padded-Treasuries-Once-upon-Treasury/dp/1412763320/ref=sr_1_56?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1259961156&sr;=1-56ISBN-10: 1412763320ISBN-13: 978-1412763325"
3,The illustrations not up to original,"This book is a re-publishing of the original Book of Fairy Tales. The illustrator's original artwork is stunning, by Adrienne Segur. However, the quality of the pictures in these republished editions is disappointing, to say the least. They lack the clarity and texture of the original, and I would not recommend this book if you are purchasing it for the illustrations. The fairy tales are sweetly written and classic, definately worth the purchase of the stories."
1,worst fairy tale book I've seen,"The book is super-barbie-girly, both in terms of illustrations and the texts. Every single story reads silly, simplistic, dry and boring. The stories are basically the same familiar old good fairy tales, but somehow the details are altered to make them ""morally correct,"" and, as sideeffects, become very silly girlish."
4,"Awesome book, not kid friendly","Great book. But not a childrens book, more of a collectible. My five year old niece was so lost she walked out the room while I was reading it to her. I had to constantly keep changing up the words for her to understand."
4,Satisfied,"Received the book we requested in a timely manner, we enjoy the book, it's not exactly what we wanted, not the fault of the supplier/or business,we are looking for a regular book size of fairy tales. Thank You."
5,Beautiful,"My daughter is still a bit too young to enjoy this book although she does enjoy the lovely illustrations. I think I really got this book for me : ). I only wish all the illustrations were in full color because the full color pictures are so enchanting. Its really a wonderful book with mesmerizing stories.Update 9/27/12My daughter is now 8 and absolutely loves the stories in this book. It has created some cozy, intimate times between us. For me, the stories do tend to get a tad redundant as there seems to be many common elements between them, but nonetheless they are enchanting. I'm looking to find another fairy tale book that has other stories in them - thinking about the fairy book I had as a kid but cannot find. In any case, this one has the most lovely graphics of any I've seen. My daughter loves looking at the pictures and hearing the romantic stories."
5,The Golden Book of Fairy Tales (Golden Classics),"I never thought I would be able to find a copy of this book! My father brought the book home from a trip in 1962. My brother and I were thrilled. Our mother read the stories to us at night. They were magical. Even now, I would never consider parting with my worn out fairy tale book. I am buying several copies for the children of friends, so they can experience the joy. The illustrations are exquisite!!"
5,Truly a Classic to be recommended to all Fairy Tale lovers,"I own an original print of this book. It was much read and much loved. I even went so far as to have my original book rebound in leather when it was falling apart. I've looked for a second copy for years but just can't afford the $175-$250 price for a vintage copy. I am so pleased to see it is being reprinted and I can buy a new copy in excellent condition. I've ordered this book so I can have a second, less fragile copy and can't wait to get it. The illustrations are stunning and there are many unusual stories not easily found. This book was truly ahead of it's time as it contained stories from many different cultures before that became fashionable. You won't be sorry if you buy this book."
4,Great resource,Found this book to teach (as a parent) an inventors unit to 1st and 2nd graders. This book has lots of details about Thomas Edison and his cohorts. Found some activities that I could do with the kids.
4,Great fun for the lover of UK 50's films,"Great English character actors with a lone American star (usually up and coming or on the way down)...but all still full of great talent, Barbara Payton was excellent. There are literate film noir style scripts with interesting twists that keep you guessing, and low budget sets but with creative shooting. And it is fun to see the exterior shots of London from the 50's.Getting to see films like these were not feasible until DVD, thank you to the inventors of DVD!"
3,Film Noir,I bought Hammer collectors set vol 1. It is a disappointment. The rave reviews about the content and the restoration is over stated. The pictures are clear but the sound is scratch. It is disconcerting to put an american actor with an all english cast (they speaking in a heavy accent) and the protagist speaking perfect american english. The statement that VCI has remastered and restored this movies is just B.S. they are faded and unfocused. Such a disappointment !!!
2,"Buyer beware! No closed captioning, as advertised!","This set is clearly listed by Amazon as being *closed captioned* (check the listing); however, the films have neither closed captioning nor subtitles and were checked on two different DVD players that always display captions/closed captioning to confirm this. For those of us who are hard of hearing or even deaf or who have difficulty hearing unfamiliar dialects (ie, British English), closed captioning/subtitles/SDH (subtitled for the deaf and hard-of-hearing), make the films watchable. Without captioning of any sort, a hard-of-hearing or deaf watcher is left to wonder, *What did he/she say??* I'd love to watch these old films, but now, due to inaccurate listing info by Amazon, will be forced to return them."
3,Hammer Film Noir Collector's Set (Bad Blonde/etc),"Sorry, but Bad Blonde not very adult. Blackout Good, Man Bait w/G.Brent ok, Stolen Face terrific. Others not terribly entertaining, but passable. Enjoyed in spite of all. I tend to think of Film Noir as being George Raft, Cagney, or Bogart, and occasionally Robert Mitchum. Guess English/British actors different? Dane Clark almost always good, tho. But this Bad Blonde had some Italian speaking fat gent who was blonde's husband, who looked like a fat frog w/mouth open. And I do NOT appreciate foreign language in a film without an English CAPTION of what is being said. This Italian gent you could not discern what he was saying even when English (assumed) was spoken by him. My, my!ALSO, although another disc/pkgs ordered, it is including ALL the 4 discs under this one heading. Will NOT let me do each separately. I don't underSTAND this. One w/George Raft is Good. Oh, well, your loss, not mine.Cecy"
5,Reading is the key to learning.,Reading is the key to learning. This set fills in all the gaps that your child may have. Great used as a summer or homeschool program.
5,Mommy and Daughter's Favorites,"I am a new mother in her early 20s. I grew up listening to Joanie. I had all of her cassette tapes. I fell in love with her Lullaby Magic 1. I am now bringing that love into the 21st century. I have purchased the MP3 albums and put them on my iPod for my 11 month old daughter. She loves Joanie just as much as I did, (and still do). I highly recommend Joanie to anyone who has children. I play Bathtime Magic for other moms who have kids that get bored in the tub and they have all bought this product, too! She takes popular songs from all genres and makes them fun and entertaining for children. Old favorites like ""Rubber Ducky"" and ""Splish Splash"" are just a couple of the great songs on this compilation. I recommend Joanie's music to everyone!"
3,Nothing new above Atmel's PDFs,"I've read this book and think it wasn't worth its price. Author didn't provide more information nor code examples than AVR datasheets and application notes written by Atmel. A half of this book contains descriptions of integrated environments for AVR micros - C, Pascal and Basic. This part was the least interesting for me. But maybe others can find it useful."
