2,Buy the other flavors of this brand,I bought this along with two other flavors of this brand and I absolutely loved raspberry chocolate and also Hazelnut chocolate. They literally tasted like brownies with almonds in them. this one though didnt taste so great but i should have known better anyway. It is spirulina after all and if you dont already know if you like that taste or not than maybe you shouldnt buy a whole box of this flavor.
2,Too rich,"Maybe the other flavors are different, but this one had a greasy film and was very intensely cashew flavored. Somehow more cashewy than a handful of cashews--in a bad way for me at least. Very difficult for me to finish even one over an entire afternoon so I shared them with my office mates who are health nuts."
2,"Not much flavor, and kind of waxy","I usually love all things cashew and agave, but this bar was a let down. I bought it because all the peanut butter bars are no where to be found due to contamination scares. The one good thing about the bar is that it's not very sweet. Otherwise, I wouldn't get these again. Of the ingredients: Cashew, Date, Agave Nectar, Almond, Amaranth, Sprouted Flax. (Certified Organic, I was only able to taste the flax and amaranth. It didn't have almond flavor or cashew flavor.Raw is supposed to be better, and most of the raw things I've tried have tasted fantastic. This wasn't the case with this bar."
2,hard rock or shell pieces in each one,"Very sweet but good in a pinch IF I didn't have to worry about breaking a tooth. Every bar had one small ""rock"" or possibly shell inside. Not worth the trouble. Seriously, be careful."
3,"Good, but not completely healthy...","The taste is amazing, I can't even taste the Spirulina, however it list Agave nectar as one of the ingredients - which is about as good for you has high fructose corn syrup... So, consume it as you would any other vegan junk food, limited."
1,Worst tasting thing I have ever had,I am sure the health benefits of this bar are good. But I could not bear to eat it. Threw the box away. Worst thing I ever tasted.
2,Cashew and agave flavor - gross,"The concept of these bars seemed pretty cool - 95% organic, live food, etc. The fat in them is ""good fat"" so that's really not anything to worry about.The with the flavor I tried (Cashew and Agave Nectar) tasted HORRIBLE though. To get an idea, imagine an old smelly shoe, rotted meat, and seaweed all mixed together and coated in grease. That's what these tasted like.Amazon sometimes posts reviews of ""similar items"", so you might see this on a review for another flavor, whhich this doesn't apply to. This revieww is only for the cashew/agave nectar."
4,Good Nutrition and Taste,"Most ""nutritious/health"" bars are none other than glorified candy. You will not find the Cashew & Agave Nectar tasting like a candy bar. They are so good that I had two. I intended to bring one home for my partner and wound up eating it and got her another one. I eat mostly raw foods, that is foods not cooked above 110 degrees. I eat mostly greens, with enough raw nuts and seeds, sprouts, tahini (sesame) butter to add enough nutrition. Raw veggies too.I think the average persons' senses are jaded with over sweet foods. The Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bar is very tasty and a plus, not having soy products in it which I can't eat.I am pleasantly surprised by a new less sweeter taste than in these glorified candy bars which are classified as ""energy bars"""
4,Delicious,My favorite nut served like this? You'd have to be nut not to love it. Healthy and delicious a combination you can't beat!
3,"good, but there's better out there...","The ingredients are what attracted me, raw and natural. However, I found them too sweet and they contain too much fat. ""Good"" fat, but made them too rich for me, I could only eat a few bites at a time...I much prefer Vega Bars. They are 100% raw and are more functional, have sprouted flax, hemp protein, wheat grass, sprouted mung bean. They taste great also. [..]"
3,Filling but not real tasty,"These bars have a pasty consistancy and are greasy with a slightly off-taste (in my opinion). They are very sweet and are, indeed, filling so they are great in the car when trying to avoid fast-food but I only like them enough to use them as a last resort. Great ingredients though and probably very good for the body."
2,very misleading name,"Silly me! I assumed that these bars would taste like spirulina and cashews, but the only ingredient you can taste in them, or any of their other ""flavors"" is DATES. If you really love dates, go for it. Otherwise, forget it!"
2,Oily,"It wasnt bad.. BUT it was TOOOO oily. It was like eating a greasy turd when it came to texture. The Go Raw brand has a better product its like eating healthy brittle with flax seed and spirulina in it plus its not as sweet.. BUT this was just way Too oily, if you are wanting to eat this on the go you better have somthing to clean your hands with when you are finished."
2,There's a reason this printer has been discontinued!,"I have had trouble getting anything to consistently print out straight on the page, even if hand fed. And now it grabbing 2 or 3 sheets at a time, as well. Ever try to find a maintenance repair kit for this printer? Don't bother - there isn't one available according to NEC. So, in order to replace the wheels that grip the paper, I have to buy a paper pic unit for $75.00, which NEC doesn't even carry! So far I've spent a good 12 hours on the internet trying to find one."
1,NEC Abandoned Current Owners of the NEC 870,"The NEC Superscript 870 is a great printer. I've used it now for three years and it's a workhorse that never jams and continues to spew out fantastic looking text, graphics, etc. I love this printer!However, I HATE NEC! NEC refuses to issue an updated driver for this printer so that it can be used with the Windows XP operating system. If you have XP or want to upgrade to XP (like I want to) this printer will suddenly become a large paper weight! This means that I spent $400 three years ago for a terrific printer that still works like a charm and shows no signs of ever stopping BUT when I upgrade to Windows XP I have to buy another printer.Simply do a search on the net for ""NEC Superscript 870 XP Driver"" for evidence of widespread frustration regarding this printer and the terrible way NEC has handled this problem.I will never again buy ANY product from NEC."
4,Not For XP,"I recently bought a computer running XP and my Superscript 870 lost all of its special features that I need, especially being able to print with a dot pattern. This is due to the fact that these features are run from Adobe Printgear which Adobe has discontinued and offers no alternative. And you can't ask a question at the Adobe site...they charge for everything! Boo to Adobe!So if you are running XP...do not purchase this printer.For those running Windows 98 or below, this is a great little workhorse printer that gave me no trouble. Unfortunately, without the special print options, I will have to sell mine."
3,No audio/video inputs or battery... great for my 3 year old though,"I bought this at Christmas time for my daughter who is 3...she loves it.We did have a problem with it loading DVDs when the power cord was connected and the unit was powered on with the DVD already in it...it took forever! Anyone who has this same problem do the following:1. Remove DVD from unit, close cover and plug in power cord.2. Power on, wait for ""no disc"" message.3. Put DVD in, wait for DVD to load...should only take 10 seconds.4. Enjoy!"
4,Almost as good as sugar,"There's no taste like real sugar, but when you're a diabetic, this is the closest thing to the real thing!"
4,Jeep Liberty troubles,I received the tink seat covers as a birthday present. I tried to put them on my Jeep Liberty last weekend and they didn't fit. the seats are too high for these covers. I have had to send them back and now i'll have to find something else to put on my seats.
4,Tinker Bell in my car,"I like the pattern and the fabric of this seat cover but it doesn't really fit my Ford Windstar Van seat very well. There are some wrinkles and the top part is too wide for the headrest. I wish the manufacturer would give more precise measurements on the website so I could find out this information before I order! The fabric is excellent as it is ""slick"" and easy to just brush off hair, dust or crumbs. The picture of ""Tink"" in cute and that is why I bought this cover, I thought my granddaughter would enjoy it even tho she is still too young to sit in the front seat.Tinker Bell Pixie Power Universal-Fit Bucket Seat Cover"
3,"Worked, but not for long","Pros: *Potentially saves a lot of money in engine repair.*Not very expensive.Cons: *Didn't work for me.*Takes a long time to flush the system out completely.I followed the directions on the bottle to the letter. I ended up flushing the cooling system 8 times before and 8 times after to make sure everything was completely clear. The product worked for 3 days, then I could feel when the plug gave way. The car loses power and idles rough. It's a leak between one of my cylinders and the cooling jacket through the head gasket, so it's pressurizing my cooling system and pushing the antifreeze out of the reservoir. This product says it works for head gaskets, but many will tell you that it doesn't work that often for that type of leak.Looks like it's time to rip the head off and do it the most reliable way."
5,awesome music!,"This is a truly amazing cd. The basslines are awesome, and seldom will you find a band this talented these days. kinda funky, jazzy, hard rock - y, you won't be disappointed by this instrumental cd."
3,Beautiful but Labor Intensive,"Anyone who has eaten at Roy's will undoubtedly get excited at the prospect of making something out of this book. The layout alone will be inspiring with all the beautiful pictures of Hawaii and the food itself. However, novices beware, this is not cooking 101. There is quite a bit of prep for most recipes - sauces that need to be made requiring a multitude of ingredients before you even get to the core of the recipe - resulting in hours of work. I could see this being ok in a restaurant environment where many of these things are made in advance and put together on order, but for the haole home cook it is a little much. Additionally, I have never been that happy with the results of my labor. My husband and I are fairly good cooks and always look at each other as we ponder why it is just not as good as we think it should be. Maybe it is missing the view of Molokini, I don't know."
5,"A must have for for fish lovers. Simple, Flavorful and Clean.","This is a must have for every library of cookbooks. The recipies translate very well in the home kichen. Although Roy's ""Roy's Fish and Seafood: Recipies from the Pacific Rim""(a newer book) share some of the same recipies and has many that are new and wonderful, ""Roy's Feasts from Hawaii"", is the first book to add if you dont have it. it tends to be a little more simple and focused."
3,Book looked used / was dirty,"The recipes are great but the book arrived dirty, with water marks on the edge. The corners were bent. Definitely was either used and/or had been sitting in a bargain bin for 5 years.Didnt affect the recipes but still, expected a ""new"" book."
5,Daunting Yet Awesome!,"These receipes are not easy but the tastes are out of this world! Great layout, specific directions, and beautiful photographs as well."
2,meh,Expect to modify it. The very flimsy tabs that hold it in the dash both snapped off when installing it. I made it work and it looks good but I would have prefered something that did not need modification.
2,Not that great,I installed this in a 2001 Ford Focus and it didn't fit that well. I had to grind and cut it to eventually make it work. I've used Scosche products before with no problems so it may fit your vehicle but not a 2001 Focus.
5,Works perfect,Pros: Fits in like a charmCons: Not sure how to get it out easily.Other thoughts: My single din radio moves around a bit but I think it's because I suck at installing(I didn't put the harness in ^_^); so this still gets a 5/5.
5,The classic,"If you just bought a pistol, this should be your first book to read (Massad Ayoob's ""Stressfire"" probably second). Nothing to add other than read, enjoy and live the advice from the ""father of modern pistolcraft""."
4,Not a hunter,"This book is wonderfully well written. Every book I read by Cooper increases my respect of the man and his knowledge. The only thing I found to knock in this book is the large section on hunting. Since I don't hunt, that section just didn't hold my interest. Although, don't get me wrong, it's as well written and informative as the rest of the book. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did enjoy the history section at the end."
2,Kindle Version Terrible,The formatting of the Kindle edition is so bad it's distracting. The text is right justified and the spacing between words is awful! The price is way too high as well. Download a trial version first. The publishers should redo the formatting in the meantime and turn off right justification.
2,great book but grossly overpriced,"Give it 5 stars at $9.99, for it's listed price you could by 2 books by Suarez. Well written, eclectic book on everything from shotgun defense to hunting in Africa. Very interesting reading."
3,Fell apart,"The content ofthe book is good, but as soon as I opened it, pages began falling out - binding problem."
2,Half of book is killing animals,"What a let down. The first half of this book is great and authoritative, peppered with humor. The second half was a disgusting exposition of killing elephants and other animals. Sickening."
3,A helpful Insight in to the world of amusementparks,This video really helps to understand what major parks go through to prepare for the days coming guests. You look into several HUGE amusement park to get a feel for this.
5,Our 2 1/2 year old granddaughter preferred this to some of her other Gifts!,"She is in a learning mode and really likes the bugs and their different colors. Easily recognized the differences between each bug and also noted their names too. Didn't know this would be such a great gift, but any young child who loves to learn could expect to be kept busy with these."
4,Informative food reference guide for The Slow food movement,Handy reference guide for people who appreciate food the way it ought to be. Good way to branch out and try different restaurants or cuisines.
3,An uneven retrospective from a master sports photographer.,"Vernon Biever is one of sport's greatest photographers. His coverage of the Green Bay Packers throughout much of the team's history reveals the work of a master of his art. All fans of sports photography should find this collection inspiring. However the book offers far too few photographs to be a true retrospective tribute to Biever's work. Most are black and white, undoubtedly reflecting the medium in which they were shot. Some also are unfocused, indicating poor or sloppy reproduction or camera work. This seriously detracts from the quality of the book. As the book is arranged on a time continuum, and with the blurred images coming later in the book, it appears as if Biever's work began to suffer in later years. One would doubt this is the intention of the editor or the publisher. But it does detract from the quality of the book and is not worthy of Biever's reputation. Perhaps this can be corrected in future editions."
2,Not a good production at all,"I paid a mere $2.00 for this at Target, and basically got my money's worth. The editing is poor (e.g., the narrator will be talking about a land campaign but the screen will be showing U-boats in action), and the film repeats many of the same images over and over again.The Russian Revolution is completely ignored (the narrator only tells us that the war in the East has ended), and the entire production has an amateur feel to it.The picture at times was buckling or was wavy near the top of the screen, which was somewhat distracting.For a capsule narration, it's not that bad however - some of the keys highlights and personalities of the war are mentioned, so this could serve as an introduction to someone with little or no knowledge of WW1.For two bucks I really can't complain, but I won't be watching this very weak production ever again."
1,Where did we go wrong?,Real punk bands like Crass and Dead Kennedys don't get tribute albums but these poseurs do? What's wrong with the world today?
1,A tribute album? Please!,"Simple Plan dont deserve a tribute album! Aside from the fact that they're poseurs they still make very repetative and depressing music. They just try to make millions in their big, fancy mansions! Well, at least they're not as bad as Good Charlotte or, oh God, HORRIBLE AVRIL LAVIGNE!! Because they admit to being pop! But still, they SUCK! Thats all there is to it! And from what I've heard this tribute is even worse than the band! Wow, plus the fact that they've only made one album this is complete waste of good plastic!"
2,bad,hey all of u dont get this cd. the singers r terrible. but those bands probably hated simple plan and tried 2 made them unpopular give that a thought
1,You're kidding me...,"A tribute to Simple Plan? What have they done to deserve a tribute? They're just another MTV poser band made by the ""industry"". I know all of the other reviwers are saying basically the same thing as me, but hey, just wanted to get my point across. Please everyone, look farther than MTV for good music. There is much better music than ""bands"" like Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, Yellowcard, Avril Lavigne, Ashlee Simpson, blah blah blah. This is just another dumb trend of music that is ruining real rock. I'm sure when MTV comes with a new genre of music that they say is cool, you will jump right on that bandwagon and say these bands aren't cool anymore. The people who listen to Simple Plan and all of those bands are the same people who listened to the Backstreet Boys. They just follow the trend that MTV says is cool."
5,buy it.,"It's enjoyable hands down, I'm not a wine fan, though it sparked interest in me for sure. and there's a lot of insightful things said, as well as a lot of emotion for a documentary, it's by no means dry."
5,Great WINE Culture Movie,"If you liked Bottle Shock then you'll like Blood into Wine. And if you haven't seen Bottle Shock then that is highly recommended, you'll love it. And if you've been to Sedona and up to Jerome, then Blood Into Wine movie more compelling."
2,"Okay performance, but that's just about it...","Of the few Barenboim/CSO Erato discs I have been courageous enough to buy, this one has proven not to be a complete disaster. The Academic Festival Overture manages to bounce along nicely to a quick end, despite the unhelpful recording acoustics and Barenboim manages a few insightful intrepretive cues in the 4th Symphony. In the competitive field of Brahms recordings however, there are many rivals who outshine Barenboim here. As such this disc sadly falls somewhere in the middle (not a place to be) in my Brahms collection. Recommended for CSO aficionados nonetheless."
4,Great with something missing,"The truth is that Barenboim has made the CSO a better orchestra than where it could go with Solti. He has given it emotion. It is an uphill battle and Chicago hasn't thanked him for it. Whatever sort of man Barenboim is, he is a deeply emotive interpreter or Brahms. In 15 years or so, I hope he comes back and re-records these to show where he has gone. Not his greatest work, but very powerful stuff and worth owning if you love a rainy Saturday with those wonderful third movement horns."
5,My 18-month old loves it!!!,"My daughter brings me this tape to play everyday! It keeps her attention from start to finish. Sally, the lead character, is a polite girl and the songs throughout the video are fun & catchy. I love watching my 18-month old laugh & dance to this video. It's amazing!!!"
5,"Bouncy, lots of action and singing.",My 3 year old really enjoys this tape. When ever she puts on a pretty dress she alwayse reminds me she is just like Sally. She will sit thru this complete tape without a break. It is just right for her comprehension and participation.
4,Great for Young Singers,"This video is dated but the music and simple story will capture those babies and toddles learning to talk. Our daughter quickly learned ""Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes"", plus Teapot song and BINGO (the Dog) song.We recommend it.Alyson[...]"
5,LOVE THE MOVIE BUT THE DVD GETS STUCK,MY KIDS LOVE THE MOVIE BUT IT KEEPS ON STOPPING I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO????
5,We Love Wee Sing Together!,We have all the Wee sing videos. My 3 year old daughter loves this tape. We watch it over and over again. This is the first Wee Sing video and one of the best.
1,Please don't waste your money!,"I NEVER write reviews so please take note that I am taking the time to share my feedback. This video is terrible. Thank God my son had no interest in it. I bought it because my son is a bit developmentally delayed. He loves to dance so I thought if we could watch the video and sing and dance along to songs like 'Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes' it would be useful for him however, this video is unwatchable. The kids are over the top with their expressions and tone, and the adults in costumes are freaky looking. I was first disappointed when they didn't even do the traditional hand movements with the song I bought the DVD for, but kept an open mind while continuing on with the video. It just got worse. It looks very low budget and more of something I could see teenagers on drugs watching for a laugh, than an educational children's video! Very disappointing."
2,Insipid stuff that apparently (most) kids like,"We received it as a present for our 21 month son. We played it, and before the first song was over he had a look of horrified amazement we'd never seen before. We asked if he was scared (no). We asked him if he liked it (no!). We asked him if we wanted to stop it (said and signed, please). This is a kid who loves Sesame Street, Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, and other programs with fantasy characters that treat and interact with kids and adults as something other than babyfied zombies. He loves being read to, is starting to count, is identifying letters, loves all sorts of music (the shows are a treat). This is the first time he wanted something to stop. It gets more than a single star because many kids (adults?) like it."
5,Very Entertaining,"I found the Wee sing DVD's by accident on Amazon. My two year old daughter just loves any videos with kids that are singing and dancing. And yes, she loves this one. I can't say enough great things about it. It is fun, colorful, and very entertaining. I plan on getting all of the DVD's."
4,Still fun after all these years!,"Already knew what I was getting before I made the purchase. My now grown children had loved this over 20 years ago. Bought it to revisit those good times with my grandsons. As in the past, the adults in the room cringe over the over-acting and corniness, but LOVE, LOVE, LOVE watching it through the eyes of the little guys. They love the music and the colorful sets. We have lots of fun singing and dancing along with the video."
5,Blast from the Past,"I used to watch Wee Sing videos when I was little. Until recently I couldn't remember what they were actually called so I looked up ""sally at her birthday party"" and found this! I can't tell you how much I used to love this movie and I am surprised and actually happy that they have this on DVD. Yes, it is dated (circa 1985) and yes it is hokey, but I remember loving it so much that I can recite the songs (the way they do) to this day! Even the address one "" My name is _____ _____, this is where I live..."" Love it. Can't wait to pass it on to the next generation :)"
5,Memories....,"I loved this movie as a kid! I later gave it to a younger cousin when I was""grown up"". My 2 yr old loves singing and dancing and can sing almost all of the songs so she LOVES this movie.""Mommy I see Together."" That's what she tells me when she wants to watch it. I get excited that she likes at least one of the same things as me as a kid. It may be an older movie, but some cartoons now adays are just bad.I love watching it with my daughter, she gets into it everytime!"
4,Old Title Still a Hit,"My daughter want to watch Wee Sing everyday (for about two weeks) then I believe she out grow it (and she is only 2 and half ^_^). I am hoping she will re-grow into this show as it suppose to be entertaining upto 8 years old.My wife was disappointed that this is not a new production. She just assumed that a 2003 copyright means that it is produced in 2003. I had to explain that DVD format is produced in 2003, but the original production was back in the 80's ^_^"
5,Toddler Chick Flick!,We have 4 kids (3 girls and a boy) and my girls have gone nuts over this show. Not so much for my son. It doesn't take those little 2 year olds to start learning the lines of the songs and it sure makes for some awesome entertainment for the rest of us! I would recommend this one to anyone with little ones!!!
1,This is what I ordered and I recieved scale master pro xe.,I ordered the scale master 6130 and recieved the scale master pro xe. i hope that it will be easy to return and get the correct item.
3,Very Technical,"Although it may be perfect for some people, this book was not what I was looking for. It promises to keep it simple--wow, I'd hate to see what's considered complicated. It's very heavy on the math and physics. If you are an engineer or a math-minded TD you might find this book fascinating. If you are looking for how-to stuff, you'll be disappointed. It contains almost no illustrations or plans and is mostly physics formulas. I'm looking for instructions and plans on how to build lighter, stronger, better sets--in other words, the findings of TD's working with theses formulas, not the math itself. If you want to design your own new stuff and get yourself into a Yale Tech Brief, this book is for you, but if you're hoping this book will be another Tech Brief Collection, you'll be disappointed."
5,Brilliant!,"Excellent music, Mozart at his fullest... it's just God's Voice... a must-have for every human being...."
1,sorely disappointed for the price,"First of all, the description on the product is off base. They should not be touting this as a comprehensive collection of information. I have been a practicing Wiccan for over 10 years and have NEVER had a use for the Necrimonicon.Secondly, the description is deceptive. I thought it would be a little more than a group of links to their site.All in all, I was really disappointed in the product. I would not recommend any one that is even remotely interested in the Craft wasting their money on this."
3,sticky cane,"I bought this cane for my daughter, she is legally blind.it does work fine for her but once you put it straight it is very difficultto fold it up again as it sticks really bad and is hard to pull apart, but she works with it."
2,Not very helpful,This book covers too many years and is way too generic. I had a 97 PU 4x4 and had a lot of trouble finding anything applicable to it. The most basic of repairs and maintenance is described in terms way too general. I'd hate to try and use this for anything remotely complicated. The pictures were nearly useless as they are only applicable to specific years.
2,Covers too many years,This book covers too many years. Only one out of five illustrations is applicable to later year models. Wiring diagrams are out of date and useless. For up to date information on your truck go to alldata.com. For $24.95 a year you can get the latest info and excellent wiring diagrams.
3,not helpful for later models,"I have a '97 hardbody. Totally unhelpful. You're better off finding the tech bulletins and specs on the web. They exist but you have to search hard.My truck was the last before the frontier so I bought the first copy as a reference. Lost it before I ever needed it and then it was a long time before I find a copy at a local store. However now, when I occasionally need it, I find that the net is a much better source. Not much in this manual is useful."
1,Buy with Caution,This description of this product is seriously inaccurate. The manual is supposed to describe models from 1980 to 1997 but the information on any model post 1985 or so is lacking. For example in the section describing how to adjust the idle on the carburetor the information does not indicate which model they are describing the adjustment on. So unless you are already familiar with the workings of the fuel system on your model you will not be able to adjust it correctly (then again if you are that familiar with the vehicle you should not be buying this book). I promptly returned the book.
5,Public Shools receive failing grades,"Anyone with children should read this book before they make a decision on where to educate their children. This book reviews politics, curriculum, and morality as it applies to public schools in the United States. This has helped me make the switch from preference to conviction. The schools of today are very different from the schools 10 to 20 years ago. They are dangerous, anti-morality focused, and saturated with secular humanism. This book helps clarify those issues and shed light on what happens while the parents aren't looking."
2,Didn't know this book was Christian based!,"I was mislead by the title of the book; I was looking for GENERAL information about the how and whys of home schooling from a non-denominational point of view. I plan on teaching my child about God and religion, but not as part of my home schooling cirriculm. I wish I had known about what the book was really going to discuss."
1,Not a very intelligent approach...,"To me, this book was the author venting about the poor moral condition of public schools; most of us know this :) And while it is a good point to make, I think it failed to provide good methods, statistics and just overall objectivism.. I am very religious, but I'm not homeschooling my kids to hide under a rock.. This book didn't even talk much about the wonderful academic aspect of homeschooling your child. I began this book set on homeschooling, and while reading I thought ""I hope I never become one of THESE people."" :) Kind of religious fanatical.."
4,Great Book with one flaw....,"A great book that deftly mixes hard science fiction with religious debate...only problem is that Jerry Oltion seems to hate President Bush and has him confused with Adolph Hitler...its a pity that Mr. Oltion fails to realize that under a free democratic regime, his ideals would flourish...under a tolterian one like the one in Iran, his book wouldn't have been published and he would have been imprisoned for hersey...something Mr. Oltion should think about..."
2,Less than I hoped for,"Being familiar with Barbara Walker's Treasuries of Knitting Patterns, I was prepared for a complete and in-depth wealth of information in this book. I was disappointed. 272 pages, and I'm guessing less than 20 pages have text -- the rest are all charts. There is sufficient information on doing the technique -- which could have been accomplished in a small pamphlet at 1/10th the price, if you ask me. She doesn't even comment much on the symbolism of the charted designs, which she certainly has the background to do! I'm not returning it, because there is a bit of worthwhile stuff in it."
3,Great Source for Mosaic Knitting Charts,"If you don't want to spend time creating your own Mosaic charts, this is a must-have resource. There are loads of charts here, some even have themes. Most charts are smallish, though, so if you have not-so-young knitting eyes you may want to photocopy them in an increased size before starting your project.If you're looking for an in-depth history or explanation of Mosaic knitting or even step-by-step instructions, then you'll be disappointed. This material is minimal.But, if you're looking for designs to use, adapt or spark your imagination, you'l find this an invaluable source book."
2,RMS TITANIC MANUAL IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY TO WAIST ON THIS.,this so called book don't tell on how he did his ship hull as part of the ship. he should have shold how he should have stared it in the first place. i wanted to do my model like the real ship but on a better way i wanted the hull as deatel work.
3,Should not be called dark blonde.,"I picked this color because I am working on going back to my natural color. This dark blonde turned out more of a light brown. Still not a bad color, just not what I was going for. Oh, and the color holds very well, it's been 3 weeks since I colored it and hardly any change!"
1,paw prints,I got this product for my new puppy Spunky who is a pug. When I got this I thought it was cute and very colorful with the paw prints. Than I put his bowls on it. Everytime he ate or drank it didn't keep the mess on it. Everything just spilled down the matt. It only lasted two days. It is made cheap and it torn right away.
4,Not Black Hawk Down,"Mark Bowden has certainly leveraged his contacts from Black Hawk Down to gain an insight not afforded to most, regarding the operations of US Special Forces. If you are looking for the fast paced action of Black Hawk Down, I don't think Killing Pablo is at the same level. Despite this, it is an extremely interesting read. I thought more could have been developed regarding some of the non-Delta players, particularly the other intel operators and how they fit into the operation (Centra Spike, CIA, etc...) But for documenting a very elusive and fascinating subject, Bowden has hit the mark once again."
3,OK. Reads like a magazine article,well written but would have prefered more indepth rather than just skimming over the surface of rise and fall of Pablo. does a good job of reviewing the final years but does not offer much in the way of details as to the rise of the most famous of all narcos.
4,"Liked it, didn't love it","Not what I expected, but informative nonetheless. I wanted to be drawn into the hunt, the attempts to escape and the feelings of the time, but I never quite felt like I was immersed in the moment."
4,Exciting Read,A good action book and a reminder of what a really terrible person Pablo was. It would be nice to have an update on what happened to many of the players in the book now.
3,Please spell correctly,"For most of the reviewers: ""Colombia is spelled with an O not a U "" !!!!!!!!!!!! And by the way.. please don't refer to Colombia as merely a ""Banana Republic"" it's much more complex, fascinating and beautiful than that."
3,Hey Miss O,"Killing Pablo was a fascinating book focusing primarily on the technology and strategies involved in the killing of one of the world's largest and most ruthless drug lords. The book is well written but becaomes a bit dull during the middle. This book is pretty detailed so I wouldnt reccoment it to anyone with a low attention span. If you fit in to that category, I would suggest just skimming through until the last section. (The Kill) I would reccoment it to anyone interested in CIA-type organizations and technology. Maybe if America would put more of this power towards the hunt for Muslim terrorists instead of wasting their time and money in Iraq, the world would be a better place."
2,Killing the Spanish language,"As a native Colombian, it has been a horrible experience to listen to Mr. Bowden's Spanish on the CD edition. It is painful. If he felt the need to read his own book, why not invest in learning the correct pronunciation of basic words and names he uses? I have only listened to one CD so far, and am tempted to stop at this point. The level of ignorance in the correct pronunciation of such basic names makes me wonder how accurate his research might be."
2,Yawn,"Once I begin a book I usually finish it, even if it's not that good.But I couldn't finish this book. I read about one third and then quit. It was so boring. It was more about politics than drugs. I guess I was expecting something along the lines of Doctor Dealer (a great read!)."
3,The other side of the story,"Ok so herre we go...so i havnt read this book but i did see that ""Matthew F Borwn said that this book bashes Mr. Pablo. Well"" this is crude.I believe that if your going to tell a part of the story dont be that much of a retard to tell the other part of the story...IF your gonna meantion the bad parts of his life, mention the good things he did. Pablo was not all a bad guy so what he sold drugs and murdered people he also did it in a perfective manor he was smart enough to cover his own ass until the end his i mean he used his brother as his own acountant come on thats genius use your own family so you know you can trust em and his brother owned ran and had in his own possesion a bicycle shop COVER UP but all in all pablo was a good man who covered his ass in the bad things he did i mean hitler was a bad dude did alot of bad things but he was a hell of a leader so again if your gonna tell a story about someones life hit both sides not just one angle."
3,Didn't hold my interest,"After reading the enthralling ""Black Hawk Down"", I was very much looking forward to Mark Bowden's next book. Unfortunately, ""Killing Pablo"" was a disappointment. ""Pablo"" is similar in style, and is well researched journalism like ""Black Hawk"", but the story jumps around quite a bit and it did not kindle my interest. Perhaps the travails of the bad guys are not as absorbing as those of the good guys."
4,Fascinating tour into the big money world of the Columbian,"This is a well researched work and revealing look at the multi-billion dollar drug industry. The power, ruthlessness and machinations of Pablo are almost beyond belief. The story of his hunt a rollercoaster.My only (small) complaint is I felt is should have been a larger book... some of the events seemed to have been sped over. Still, an excellent read."
3,"Compelling Story but not as well-written as ""Black Hawk Down","If you've read Bowden's ""Black Hawk,"" you will find this story less action-packed and far more redundant. It is an amazing story of corruption and vigilanties, if you don't know the history. Worth a read for educational purposes."
3,"Fascinating subject, so-so story-telling","great book, incredible subject.My only hang-up is the author's story-telling style. Bowden does a much better job of telling a story in a logical, easier-to-follow timeline in Blackhawk Down, but in this book he jumps all over the place, and doesn't do the best of jobs in keeping the reader aware of the timeline of events. Bowden's fact-finding in regards to covert operations is incredible, he certainly has access to information that no other author has, and for that alone this book is well worth a 5 star rating. But the telling of the story itself in this book is much less than it could be. A good example of an excellently-told story with similar subject matter is the book Inside Delta Force by Eric Haney; Bowden's story-telling skills pale in comparison to Haney's. And for that reason alone I have to give the book 3.5 stars."
4,An engaging read,Slows down in patches but overall quite enjoyable and a fascinating glimpse into Columbia politics and the drug business.
3,"Amazing story, poor execution","Even though the events of this story occurred 2-3 decades ago, they are still shocking. How one person could bring an ostensibly democratic country to its knees is difficult to imagine, and yet it happened. The author did a good job researching the book, providing inner thoughts of the key players, and presenting the timeline in a way that made the book difficult to put down. However, the finished product reads like a college paper, not the polished work of a professional. The book could have used a few more rounds of editing and revision before publication.Note to Kindle readers: the formatting of the Kindle version is rather suboptimal in anything other than the smallest font size. The font typeface itself cannot be adjusted. The chapter forward/backward feature does not work. If there were any pictures or illustrations in the print version of the book, they are not present in the Kindle version."
4,Not a bad crime story,"This book went fast for me. The author's style is fairly direct, which is good given the subject matter (less direct approach leads to bogged down in names and who was where, etc.). On the negative side, occasionally he goes a little too fast and I missed important issues and people. In addition, this book loses a little perspective due to it largely being from the perspective of law enforcement - those who knew Pablo Escobear as associates are largely dead. Overall though, it's like a good piece of crime/manhunt drama."
3,I have A.D.D.,"This book is very interesting in that it will bring you step by step through what was goin on in columbia and how life in the country is very unstable. Be cautious however. Mark Bowden makes this book into a history book. A very cool history book in that it talks about drugs, fame and riches; yet boring in the way it was written.Mark goes into detail about how Pablo was givin the opportunity to do what he acomplishes, I suppose I was expecting more of a narrative rather than documentation. It was hard to comprahend what goes on in this book.I suppose you need to be in the right audience. I was looking to be entertained by this story, and to a certain extent I was, but this book was honestly made to inform people. Hope you enjoy it."
3,"more informative than entertaining, humorless","This book provides insight into the issues surrounding the international drug market and offers much more than an historical perspective on Pablo Escobar. The author does not attempt to demonize the villians nor does he diminish the extent of the evil. The heros are presented as the imperfect humans they are, which I consider an essential element in nonfiction. The book held my interest, but I was not burning the midnight oil to finish is. There was little or no comic relief, which is not impossible to do, even in a book about such a serious matter."
3,"Great Story, Poor Writing","The story is tremendously interesting, but the author writes very poorly. He jumps around and does have a clear stream of thought sometimes. Things in the book never happen in chronological order. The story itself is fasnicating, so I say it is worth the read."
4,Even better than fiction,"Pablo Escobar, his life is just unbelievable, it's hard to believe that one person can affect so many lives. If you think about it, this guy permanently changed the lives of thousands of people not only in Columbia, but all over the world.This is a book you must read...I read the movie is set to release sometime in 2009, you should definately read the book before the movie comes out!"
5,Another Bowden Thriller,"The full story of the life and times of Pablo Escobar: from his early life of crime as a headstone thief to his brutal rise to the pinnacle of the Medellin drug cartel. Most of the story however, is about how the joint military and intelligence Task Force eventually cornered and killed the drug Kingpin. That Task Force, was led by Ambassador Morris (Buzz) Busby, Navy Seal and ex-DCM for the Conference on Disarmament under Ambassador Louis (Lou) Fields (while I served as part of the US delegation with him.)The US ""Delta Force,"" in conjunction with the Colombian security forces in an operation called ""Centra Spike"" had to pull out all of the stops to finally locate and kill the elusive fugitive.Not since ""Black Hawk Down"" has Mark Bowden written such a gripping thriller. Anyone who liked Black Hawk Down will love this one too.Five Stars"
4,Know your history,"A must read if you want to really know Pablo Escobar - the history, stats, numbers and some key people. Its so easy to read you wouldn't want to put the book down. Def. check it out!"
4,Crazy,"Certain people make a huge impact on others, not always for the good. Pablo was hugely influential in his lifetime and had no idea how he was able to impact and influence so many people (aside from the obvious)."
4,Killing Pablo,"This book started out slow for me considering the force that was Black Hawk Down. However, after the first 20 pages you can't put it down. Riveting, the writing just demands your attention. I mean, I skipped reading both my NY Times and Wallstreet Journals for 3-days to read this book. By the way, the way events unfolded in Columbia; the drug lords influencing events; inept, flaccid and corrupt government; indiscriminate and unspeakable murder and mayhem on one side being confronted by heroic and unimpeachable citizens does that sound familiar-Mexico. Both sides in the Mexican drug war are using the playbook that originated in Columbia. In the end, the good guys win because good always triumphs over evil.."
4,Gripping Read,This was a gripping recounting of a story that has passed quickly from memory. It is amazing think about the power that men like Pablo Escobar wielded just a few years ago. Bowden recounts Escobar's rise and fall in fascinating detail in this non-fiction work. Much of the book has the pacing and action of a novel.A minor complaint in the audio version is Bowden's poor Spanish pronunciation. I listened to this book on tape with my brother who is a fluent Spanish speaker and he found the pronunciation quite annoying.
5,"If you are considering this book, buy it. It's terrific!","I really enjoyed Black Hawk Down, and I am interested in Colombia. So this book was an easy pick. However, I was concerned that maybe the author might be a ""one hit wonder."" Not so.This book is engaging from the very start, and I think it is every bit as good and right now I am thinking it is even better than BHD.If you are interested in Pablo Escobar, or just what life has been like in Colombia during the last few decades, you won't regret reading this book."
5,"Sad, bloody story",A deeply troubling but fascinating look into the horrific and bloody life of Pablo Escobar and the tremendous effort that went into his elimination. Hard to put aside.
3,Pablo Escobar Book,"So well written; Bowden has done it again. Edge-of-your-seat revelations about how things are done. Wish it had pictures in the Kindle Edition, though. I had to go onto the Internet to look everyone up."
4,Does The End Justify The Means?,"Pablo Escabar grows from a local bandit to the feared leader of Columbia's Medellin Drug Cartel. Despite a calm personality, he is a ruthless killer, responsible for hundreds of murders. When Paplo aspires for public office, the Columbian Government, backed by U.S. agents, decide to stop him. Civil war breaks out in the country and the stakes increase. As the situation deteriorates, the hunters take on many of Pablo's worst characteristics. Capturing Pablo won't be enough. The goal is to kill him.Mark Bowden, author of 'Black Hawk Down', is a gifted researcher and storyteller. The enjoyment and intensity glows during the hunt, but cools as the author at times piles on too much background and statistics. Overall, 'Killing Pablo' is a great tale, demonstrating, again, the power of well-written non-fiction."
3,Runs Too Long,"Black Hawk Down is one of my favorite books. From page 2 onward, there's not one dull moment. I wish the same could be said for Killing Pablo. This book really drags and at about the halfway point you're wishing that they'd cut to the chase already and kill the SOB."
2,Don't bother it's boring.,"Not really interested in all the political propaganda written here, got tired of reading it but did persevere to the end."
4,Escobar never had a chance...,"Bowden's narrative of the Escobar pursuit is truly gripping; it reads better than most fiction in the genre. The story, while very detailed, feels as if there is more to tell. I don't believe this is through any fault of Bowden's investigation or research, since his detail in BLACK HAWK DOWN was remarkable. In all likelihood, some unknown facts - such as the true identity of Los Pepes, the extent of the Bloc's and America's involvement with Los Pepes, the varied means employed by Escobar to constantly avoid capture - may be facts that can never be discovered. An ironic parallel between the two stories is that, although the Mogadishu effort in BLACK HAWK DOWN was a failure and the Escobar ""capture"" was considered a success, Bowden cleverly asks whether the price paid to eliminate Escobar recharacterizes the effort as something less than a success. Overall, an excellent read."
3,An Absorbing and Fun Read,"This is a fun and absorbing read about the assassination of Medellin Cartel founder and drug lord Pablo Escobar -- and the role of the United States in that assassination.Bowden does a good job of portraying Pablo's rise to power, characterizing him as completely ruthless in the use of violence, yet strangely understated and charming. Pablo's ability to portray himself as a populist and the success of his kidnapping campaign against the Columbian aristocracy make for fascinating social history.To his credit, Bowden does not write a feel-good ending. Obviously, other drug lords, perhaps even more insidious that Pablo, benefitted from his demise. Still, a figure like Pablo is a grave threat to Columbian society, and it is hard to debate the necessity of his elimination or of American cooperation in that endeavor."
4,"A good read,but its not Blackhawk Down","If you were looking for a book with the pace of Blackhawk Down, you may be dissapointed by this book. But overall its a good read."
2,reads like a 200 page long magazine article,"I was not impressed with the massive amounts of true facts accumulated in this book, I was confused. The story line is actually quite simple: Pablo was a gangster who used brutality to gain control over an cocaine smuggling network, and was eventually hunted down with massive aid from the USA. Unfortunately, the author does not succeed in weaving this narrative into a good read."
2,"Disappointing after ""Blackhawk Down""","After reading and thoroughly enjoying Bowden's ""Blackhawk Down"", I expected the same level of gripping human drama and military intrigue. I was disappointed! Bowden took too little real information, stretched it too thin, and made a short story into a full-length book. The story got very tedious, with repetitious-sounding ""we almost got him"" stories. It was worth reading just to learn more about Pablo, but the real content of the book could have been wrapped up in less than one hundred pages."
5,Engaging,"Current history piece that reads like a novel. Really keeps your attention, but also educates on a situation and culture of which most Americans know little."
4,Killing Pablo,I found this book well written. Not only was the book of clear historical value it was also a very in depth expose of the person of Pablo and the cartel he managed. It is a historical fact that many great nations in our worlds history have been taken down by the populations use of drugs so that their values change to the extent the nation no longer survives its high standing the the world. This is happening to our USA. The book reveals our nations appetite for drugs. The book shows the work of real hero's in our law enforcement and what they face in this epic battle for our country. Sad fact is revealed that due to the appetite of our citizens for these drugs the battle is being lost.
5,It took guts to bring Escobar down,"I was born in Bogota Colombia and moved to the U.S when I was 10. My father was born in Medellin and he came to the U.S when he was 16. He witnessed a great deal of bloodshed as a boy. We rarely go back to Colombia. It's such a beautiful country but that is tainted by the lawlessness that permeates their society. ""Killing Pablo"" was a testiment to how messed up Colombia is but it is also a great story depicting some incredible heroism. It took a great deal of cunning and guts to bring Escobar down especially since he was so feared and so powerful. It is amazing how many loyal fans he had."
3,Was Expecting More...,"I was expecting more out of this one. It wasn't bad, but it really dragged on through the middle and I was a bit of a strain to finish it. I think the main problem was the main players in the story just weren't very interesting enough, even Pablo. There also didn't seem to be enough of a book here. It would have added more to the story if Bowden went deeper into the CIAs involvement in the Drug War."
3,Mistaken Identity,I saw the authour on TV promoting his bin Laden book and carelessly bought the wrong book. Its a niche book which I found interesting because of Pablo's activities in this region but overall a total bore. That being said it seems to have been thoroughly researched and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.I eventually grew tired of the detail and finished the story on Wikipedia.
3,Blame Canada,"The comedy is OK but a the end of the day this is from Canada, and this show always leaves me with a sense of despair for the three main characters."
5,Obviously has no idea!,"Having read all the reviews for 'Professor Midnight' (awesome, fantastic, could not put down etc,) I was amazed to read (Warning: Avoid at all costs)pathetic review. A vindictive,ill-informed personal attack on the author was how it sounded. The book was a well-written, exciting, impossible to put down read from cover to cover."
3,Not really that impressive,"The only nice feature of this mouse is that it's wireless. For normal usage, the mouse is OK, though a bit heavy. For gaming, it's totally useless, here's why: #1, the scroll wheel doesn't click into place, so if you have your scroll wheel bound to previous/next weapon like most people do, weapon changing will be erratic. #2, the tracking on the optical mechanism is TOO good. Meaning, it's very common in games to move your mouse to the left, pick it up just slightly, move to the right, drop it, and move to the left..and repeat the process (quickly spinning your character around to the left). With this mouse, the tracking is so strong on it, when you're lifting up the mouse slightly and moving it to the right, it will detect that and turn your character back to the right again.So, take my review with a grain of salt. For non-gamers, this is a pretty solid mouse. For gamers, it's a flawed product, avoid it."
4,"Tilt Wheel, cruise, ac....","This mouse is smooth. I enjoy the new shape and contours as I have a large hand for most men my size. However, other men in the office of average size find the new shape pleasing. The non-ratcheting action on the scrollwheel will decrease risk of carpel-tunnel, but it might be a bit touchy for sensitive users (if you like to use the 3rd button click). The wireless technology works great. The connection never fails, 6' range is more than enough and battery life seems fine. I was surprised to find that it takes AAs and not some crazy custom battery. Only complaint is in the software - you cannot set up program specific button settings like the old intellimouse. But I am sure this will be fixed in a matter of time? Finally the array of new colors fully completes the office desktop ensemble. Happy driving!"
2,Returned It In 2 Days,"This is one of the worst Mice I have ever used. I own the Logitech LX700 keyboard mouse combo, Logitech MX610, and a Logitech Optical Wheel Mouse. Each are excellent to use. The Logitech MX610 was to replace my generic Dell mouse at work. Instead I first purchased this Microsoft Mouse. My biggest problem with the mouse was how extremely heavy it felt. It fatigued my hand and wrist to navigate the mouse from point to point. After using it for 2 days it was returned and exchanged for the Logitech MX610. The MX610 is the finest mouse I have ever used. It is light and precise allowing a user very accurate clicking and not simple because it is a laser instead of optical. The buttons are a joy to press. I can't say enough about the Logitech MX610 but to buy one if you interested in one of the best mice developed by Logitech."
1,NO CHARGER AND NOT RESPONSIVE ENOUGH,"In short get the LOGITECH MX 700 instead. Superior in comfort, performance and battery life irrelevant because of built in charger (hello Microsoft). I'm so happy I switched."
3,If you want to assign buttons - stay away from this one.,"Info for gamers: The new intelliMouse 5 software does not support assigning normal keys to any button except ""enter"". The droplist is pretty extensive(ie. open, close,back etc) but no user assignable keys(like ""f"" or ""d"") are available. The tilt wheel also won't work for the games. I was hoping to use it for leaning around corners - but no go. Hopefully MS will release some new drivers..."
2,Costs a fortune in batteries,If you buy this mouse get ready to pay a fortune in batteries! I use heavy duty batteries and they last about a week.
1,Very dissapointed,I am beginning to think that I got a used product that was not good to begin with. I have had nothing but trouble from the start. We have many other just like this and have never had a problem. This has been very frustrating.
5,Very Nice,"I bought this mouse about six months ago and I still think its the best mouse I've ever seen. The wireless works up to even 6ft away from the transmiter. It works better by putting the mouse and the transmiter in one level. The scroll is excellent (Right, left, top, and bottom.) I can't tell anything about the battary life because I'm using rechargable battaries. I think it would be still good to use regular battaries. The extra bottoms are usefull. You can change the functions. If you want to use them you have to install a software for it but if you don't its plug and play. I'm happy with my purchase."
4,"Great ergos, except it's heavy","This is very nice mouse, very sensitive and comfortable. The wheel action is absolutely awesome, smooth, precise, and feels great! The only thing I don't like is: it's a bit heavy. I'm not a small person, or even too picky, but even for myself, the weight seems a bit odd. whenever u try to move the mouse by picking it up, it tilts back because most of the weight is on the back. I'd still recommend it, esp. if weight is not an issue for you."
3,I guess it works...,"It works pretty well, but if you're the type of user that needs a middle mouse button then I'd skip this one. You can assign a middle mouse click to any of the buttons, but I prefer to have it in the middle where the scroll wheel is. I've found that if there is ANY scroll motion on the wheel, it won't function as a button when clicked. Basically, you have to be very careful to not scroll the wheel even a hair when you click it, and that requires skill and concentration."
3,Not for left-handed people,"I agree with all the technical praise of this mouse. However, if you are left-handed, or use a laptop, this is not the mouse for you. The mouse is not symmetric, so it feels awkward in the left hand. Most annoying for a laptop user is that the transmission base is almost as big as the mouse, and is connected by a long cord, so in some sense this mouse is not wireless at all. If you are sitting away from a desk, or are using a portable desk, there is little place to put the base, and the wire dangles down and gets in the way. Other wireless mice have small ""stick"" transmitters which plug into the USB port and are unobtrusive. Get one of those if you work away from your desk much."
1,Worst mouse ever,"This is the worst mouse I have ever owned. Signal strenghth is terrible, scroll wheel is too slow, and the mouse is too heavy. Total waste of money."
1,"Unfortunately, Low Quality","This thing lasted me about two months before it wigged out on me, and quit working altogether. I went with the Logitech MX1000, and figuring out Microsoft's warranty service on this Mouse I originally paid $49.00 for is not worth the hassle. The Logitech was about 30 dollars more, but worth it...it actually works, and has an impressive array of features. I won't be buying a mouse from Microsoft anytime soon, unless it is totally innovative."
2,Disappointed -- buying a wired one,"I bought this mouse a few months ago and have had annoying problems with it. You click on things and it doesn't always register -- so you don't know if you really clicked or not, end up double clicking, etc. Not having a wire is not enough of a benefit for this hassle. Also, having a wheel which doesn't ""click"" is bad if you use Access forms. The old, clicking style wheel takes you through subforms at one click per page -- this new one is arbitrary. Plus if you spin the wheel fast it can lock up, forcing you to sit there and watch while it scrolls and scrolls. I cannot recommend this product."
3,Don't recommend,"Been using the corded 3.0 for 5 years and dissappointed in this one. Microsoft replaced my 3.0 with a 4.0. The f/b buttons were moved up higher so your thumb is constantly moving up & down. It is more narrow and doesn't support the cup in your hand. This has been painful for me since I use all day with a wrist pad never had that problem with the 3.0. I have to stop frequently to rub my palm and stretch my hand because it causes you to cup your hand more. I do have large hands for a woman and the 3.0 fit well. I would wait for another design, or try it out in the store first. This would be better than some 2 button mouse but not for a heavy user. 3 stars for the optical - 2 stars for the design."
2,Disappointed after using the corded version,"This mouse looked good and felt good in the store. It worked right out of the box after getting it home. However, being a female with smaller hands, it is fatiguing to move around after a while, and I find myself stretching my finger just to reach the wheel. It seems like it is meant for big hands. This mouse is much heavier than the corded optical mouse, most likely from the batteries. But it feels big and clunky when moving it around. The wheel is also not as sensitive as the corded version, and does not have that nice little ""click"" when you move it. Also, the wheel does not move very easily like on the corded version where you could just roll it and fly down a screen. This one takes some work! Maybe I will give it to my husband or son to use."
1,do you really need wireless?,"I had to replace my wired mouse and went to Staples. The only mice they had with decent ergonomics were wireless, so I decided to try one out.What a mistake. I can see using a wireless mouse in a conference room or other setup where you don't want to be tethered, but for a typical office setup they're kind of silly.1. The receiver (which incidently could easily be mistaken for an actual mouse, as it is the same size and shape and is attached by a cord to the computer) sat about six inches from the mouse in my setup. That's like sitting six inches from yout TV and using a remote.2. My mouse pad is slightly sloped and, without a cord to hold it in place, the mouse frequently slides off onto the floor.3. I now have something else to buy batteries for.4. I paid more for this than a wired mouse.Aside from that it's a decent mouse. The feel of the wheel is nice and I like the side scrolling feature. But it's going back and I'm getting the wired version."
2,Not for laptops,"I bought this mouse for my work laptop which I primarily use at my office. I was very excited about the side scrolling feature since I look at very large spreadsheets on a regular basis. What I discovered was the software that comes with the mouse conflicts with my touchpad. I talked to customer service and there doesn't seem to be a resolution to the problem. Now I am using it with my home computer and I have found that the side scrolling is a little slow to be useful. Overall the feeling, buttons, and precision are very good, but the two selling points (side scrolling and wireless) didn't work for me."
2,New Arrivals Sock Monkey Cradle Set,"I ordered this product from another website and the product over all is pretty nice, however, the blanket comes only in the three piece set that everyone wants to charge $70-80.00 extra for. After receiving the blanket, I have to say, skip it and save yourself the money and go get another blanket. For $80.00 I expected a nice size blanket not a burp cloth. It is tiny and should be $20.00 extra at the very most. Also, be aware that the bumper is pretty fluffy and I do have some concerns about how much it sticks out into the cradle. I will probably end up taking it off once the baby shows signs of being able to roll over."
3,Leooonnn!,"This is perhaps one of the funniest movies to watch with your friends at 2 in the morning while drinking. We've actually made the movie a drinking game...when anyone finds a clue, drink. When Michael J. Fox is on the screen, drink. Classic 80's entertainment, right down to the tight shorts and feathered hair. I wonder if Peggy and Lulu are having any luck."
3,It was fun!,"Having appeared in this film - on the white ""nerd"" team - I never thought it would achieve almost ""cult"" status. I had just finished appearing in a ""serious"" play, and while I did have fun filming, it was quite a let down for me. Although I thought the finished movie was an light diversion, upon the films release it was blasted by the critics and - I thought- destined to oblivion. But a ""cable classic""? What a pleasant surprise. Unknown at the time, Michael J. Fox was nice and friendly to work with...and who knew? For me the film is now a guilty pleasure. Enjoy."
3,"the plot was weak, for a movie that had a lot going on.",This movie is a hoot. Not only did Michael J. Fox begin his acting career in it but my brother as well. My brother was one of the nerds. His name is Christofer Sands. I believe it was directed by two college guys who sold the idea of a huge treasure hunt to Disney.
3,Blast from the past!,"I had watched this movie when it first came out, I was 4. I have been looking for it for awhile. I loved it."
5,Fond memories from the early days of cable.....,"Like many people who reviewed this movie, I first saw it when HBO would show this movie over and over and over! It was probably shown 10 times a day!Anyway, this movie is a hoot, and reading the reviews of others had brought a lot back to me. I plan on showing this movie to my kids!"
4,"I hate to admit it, but I love this movie.","My brother and I, as children of the 80's, grew up on this campy movie. We still quote it to each other (""Fagabeefy!"") on the phone and in person... it's really roo funny. And never takes itself too seriously. I can remember staying up late to watch this in college, too, and now that I have it on DVD I am thrilled. This, Wargames and The Last Starfighter... I'm ten years old all over again."
4,Hot diggity,"OK, technically, this movie should be rated about a one. The thought that any college kid would take part in the ""Great Allnighter"" (especially since Leon is in charge of the whole ordeal) is truly unlikely. I was a complete drug fiend nerd in college and I don't think even I would have done it, (at least not with the same amount of gusto and ferver). Despite the overall dorkiness and the somewhat predictibility of the movie, it is an absolute masterpiece in its own right. 'Tis a gutsplitter and a half in my book."
5,Can anyone say CHEESE??,"This movie is bottom line 80's cheese, but i love every minute of it!! I just got my hands on a copy last year, but i think i may have to buy the official copy through Amazon.com. Why not for $6.99?? If anyone else hasn't noticed...Melio appears in both Grease movies. And from what i can recall, Booger is not in this timelessly awesome flick!! Long Live FAGABEEFE!!!!!!!"
5,"CLASSIC '80s COMEDY, BABY!!!","This one is up there with ""Better Off Dead"" and ""Airplane."" Well, not as well-known, but it's along the same lines. Just such a classic."
4,Classic Entertainment,A movie to be treasured. An inspiring Disney movie for those looking to create their own puzzling Great All-Nighters. A must see.
4,A must see!,"I saw this film when it was released to cable and have been looking for it to add to my collection ever since. Wild, funny, silly yet still respectable. A cute cut-up and angst movie of college kids without having to add foul language and overdriven sex to make the movie. See this with a group of friends and I challenge you to come up with as good a scavenger hunt!"
1,A Waste of Time,"I'm guessing that many of the other reviewers of this movie are 9 years old. If you are a thinking adult human being, this movie is asinine and not worth your time. I wish that I could somehow recover the time I spent watching it. Usually, the average Amazon rating is within a star or star-and-a-half of my personal opinion. But not this one.Sadly,Ed"
3,Midnight Madness - The Phantom Booger,Um...It seems everyone sees something in this movie that I haven't - Curtis Armstrong (aka Booger) doesn't actually appear in this film despite at least 3 mentions in other reviews on here...But great PeeWee cameo...
3,Good classic 80's film.,This is one of those badly made 80's movies that is still fun to watch. It brings back so many memories from the days when the Duke's of Hazzard were on during prime time and kids were riding their big wheels.
5,Self Evident,"Are you a student of The Ancient Astronaut Intervention Theory? If so, what's more to be said, you know this is the book for you."
4,Very Interesting. Scientists again manipuilating facts for their agendas,"A good read. Discredited Darwinian evolution. Shows how so many scientists will manipulate findings to suit this antiquated therory. Although I feel the author needed more evidence for some of the fantastic claims made in Chapter six : Evidence for Advanced Culture in Distant Ages , it was fun to read.( Their may have been more in the unabrigded version to back up their claims.) It made me aware of how truly unreliable dating methods can be and how easy they can be manipulated. Overall interesting and shows that we all need to continue to be sceptical of accepted scientific ""FACTS""."
1,Great fiction,There's nothing really scientific on this book. It's only a great fiction work really. Almost comic most of the time. Have that in mind when you read it!
4,Questions Please!!!!!!,"Many years ago, in my youth mind you, I asked several questions of my archeaology and history professor that gave them headaches. I was the kid who would ask why or why not, followed by how come?This book focus on those questions, and the idea of thinking out side of the box. Its refreshing to find that there is evidence that many others outside of the norm have begun to put the puzzle of our world and its history together. That those ""myths"" indeed have clues, that answers are not just because someone has an alphebet soup after their names say it is true.Let this series of essays rock your notions of ""what is"" and ""should be"" to the possiblities of why not?"
1,save your money,Just not what I expected. The writer of this book should be a novelist with all those funny ideas he have.He is 100% dedicated with telling that all humans come from outer space and will not accept e.g. the bible as truth. Only his own ideas. He does not even accept science....Crazy book with crazy wild ideas
1,BEWARE,"I purchased this book for my Manga obsessed 14 yr old son and was quite suprised to find it came with a ""Mature"" sticker on the front and some very ""R"" rated material within. I do admit it is a beautiful book but not appropriate for teens. I did not see any kind of disclaimer in the product description so this is your warning. Not appropriate for kids!"
4,4 way,Not as potent as the original 4 way but a good product. Packaged well and came on time. No problems with the order.
4,Great Product!,It simply Good Sense to buy this product. I have a chronic nasal condition and this nasal spray clears me up without clearing out my bank account. ;-) Thanks!
4,This is NOT a Star Trek book,"While a decent portion of the book focuses on Star Trek, most of it does not. This is a book about Walter Koenig, a self-admittedly neurotic actor. For me, this difference made the book very enjoyable. Here you will get a humorous look into the actor's life, complete with looking for work, working as a hotel package boy, dealing with agent's lies, and more. This book was a lot of fun."
2,Neurotic is the word,"Everybody knows that all the actors in Star Trek did their autobiographies, so , I thought, why not read this one? I was in for a surprise! I usually don't comment a book I didn't finish but maybe Mr Koenig should have seen a psychiatrist longer than in his youth. Why write something like that? Jokes are cheap, writing is erring at best, thoughts are at random (an editor,please!!!!) not much to say, really... He does have an interesting career but must he explain all his doubts and neuroses too? It is honest , I know, but I prefer to read about Career & Life...I got fed up ... I would have read DeForrest Kelley instead...If you want something really interesting to read about the less ""principal"" characters in Star Trek OS, go to Takei's or Nichols books: THAT is worth it!"
2,This is not Hopkinson Smith's best recording,"This was the first weiss-cd I bought, played by my favorite lutenist: Hopkinson Smith. In the meantime I have a collection of 15 Weiss-cd's. So let's compare. Although Hopkinson Smith is the best interpretor of French renaissance lute-music, he is definitely not the best Weiss or Bach interpretor. If you compare the sonata n 23 in F sharp minor with the version of Lutz Kirchhof (Weiss vol.3), the version of Lutz Kirchhof is a 1000 times better: clearer, more rhythmic... So, who wins the prices for the best Weiss-performances: definitely not Hopkinson Smith, but Robert Barto, Lutz Kirchhof and Konrad Junghänel. I'm sorry Hopkinson Smith, but You should stick to Ennemond Gaultier or Jacques de Gallot: those are the composers you can play best."
5,"Weiss, the Bach of the lute","Weiss is a great composer of the same height as Bach, Händel, Zelenka or Vivaldi. Of his vast catalogue only survived almost 600 pieces for lute solo, that's the main reason of he's now a little known composer. Just listen to this superb performance by Hopkinson Smith, the best lutenist of our time, his impressive technique, soft touch and depth makes this CD a meditation with the spiritual message of baroque music."
5,tinkle the ivory,After a very long long time away from the childhood piano lessons I once took...I decided to give it try again.This book was just what I needed to help me get started with confidence. It's clear and easy to follow. I was on the piano and actually playing a bit again in short order. I loved it.I've sat down at the piano in the past and been completely lost. This book help me find my way back to tinkle the ivory. I highly recommend it as a tool to get you going!
5,hours of educational fun,"my daughter loves these little dudes. she can count them, make paterns by color and species, sort them tell sories about them, play with them, they versitile and i like them cause they come in a nice litthe bucket."
4,Good Enough,"Patrick Stewart does make a difference in the narration. The sound does have a background noise, but given that this is a children story, who cares. My daughter played it every day for a week!"
2,"Great expression, but poor mixing kills it","Peter and the Wolf is my favorite piece of music from my childhood, and I was quite pleased when someone gave me this CD for by birthday this year. The musicianship and narration are quite good: expressive and emotive.Unfortunately, the volume range on the CD is quite wide, ranging from inaudible to bowel-quaking. In the mix, the orchestra is either at one extreme or the other, but the narration is almost always too quiet to make out against the music. In addition, I can hear several places in the piece where gain peaks have introduced distortion into the sound.The music and narration are very well done, but the recording job was botched big time. I would recommend you purchase a different copy of Peter and the Wolf."
3,Poor Mixing really spoils this CD,"I'm a real Patrick Stewart fan, so when I was looking for a copy of Peter and the Wolf for my daughter, this one caught my eye.The music is excellent, and Patrick Stewart's narration is wonderful, but the recording level on the CD is so low that you must turn the volume up much farther than normal to hear it. When you kick the CD out (if you're using a player that defaults back to an FM receiver, you have to remember to turn the volume down first, or it'll blow your eardrums out.In addition, the recording levels vary far too much across the recording. The levels for Stewart's narration, for instance, is very low. You have to turn it up to hear him, but then the drums which represent the hunter's rifles will almost blow you out of your chair. It gets to be very tiresome having to listen with one hand on the volume knob all the time. I was dissapointed."
5,Wonderful Recording,"I originally had been searching for the recording Sir Alec Guiness did in the '70s, however it seems to have been out of print for some time. That having been discovered, I purchased this as I was familiar with Patrick Stewart's voice. Let me add, that this was for my 5 year old son, whom I wanted to experience this at this point in his life.We've had it a couple of weeks and we've spend HOURS listening to it. Patrick Stewart does a tremendous job narrating this classic Russian tale.As an adult listener, Nagano and the Opera de Lyon work together as hand in glove. It sounds perfect!"
2,Poor mixing and limited emotional range on narration,"The orchestra plays beautifully, but it is painfully obvious that they recorded their part separate from the narration. Patrick Steward sounds as if he is in a different room with his back to the microphone. Also, even though I am a Patrick Stewart fan, I find his narration entirely too serious and stayed. He reads it more like an essay than a fun story for children."
2,Does not fit 2002 GMC Envoy,Had to return item. Does not fit GMC 2002 Envoy as the description states.
2,Lost it 1st time,Lost it 1st time we were out and about with our new camera. Not sure if it wasn't on right (my fault) or wasn't tight enough (manufacturer's fault). Next time I get one I will get one with a strap too.
5,MIT 6.270 in book form,"I just finished participating in the MIT 6.270 Autonomous Robot Competition. This book really pulls together everything you need to understand how to build a robot from Lego parts, and interface it to the real world using a variety of sensors and actuators (aka motors). There is so much to be learned by actually BUILDING a robot - this is a great book to help you dig into your own project. You can order the same hardware and software used in the MIT class off the internet as well."
5,Excellent story - excellent read,"I just had to write a review of this book to encourage others to read it. It's more than just an account of man's never ending inhumanity to man, but a story about conscience...what was America's military going to do about a large group of men it apparently had declared ""expendable""? How military/political leaders can readily make promises to save this group out of one side of their mouth, and give orders to do nothing out of the other side amazes me.Forgotten, ignored...this brave group of men lived on, despite great odds, until their deliverance was at hand from yet another brave group of men...men of conscience. To me, they are heroes as much as those who survived the POW camp.Yet another story to make us count our blessings...and to give hope that American ideals aren't always misplaced when it's expedient."
4,Dynamic and Informative,"Sides has written a compelling account of a little-known and long-overlooked chapter in military history. His work is fair and honest, making Ghost Soldiers both a page-turner and, ironically, difficult to read.My only problem is the book's lack of an index. On that basis, I'd give it 4-1/2 stars if Amazon would provide that option."
5,Celebration of complete heroism.,"A daring rescue once known to every American schoolchild but now long forgotten was ordered. 121 hand-selected troops from the elite U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines. Their mission was to march thirty miles in an attempt to rescue 513 American and British POWs who had spent three years in a camp near the city of Cabanatuan. This is the story of a stirring and heroic rescue operation in World War II. Gives us an enthralling and deeply disturbing look at the horrors of war. There's grief, despair, and terror, but the story ends much more satisfying. Thrilling from start to finish, as the book celebrates the heroism of the elite U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion.FinancialNeeds.com"
4,Ghost Soldiers,"A complete story...well researched. Sort of the ""Private Ryan"" rescue mission of Asia Pacific in real life without the special effects. Appeal to the adventure, history, military or Asia Pacific fan. Very hard to put down."
5,"Johnny ""Booch"" - This is a must read","This author brings you into the story in the first couple of pages. You feel the ""true to life"" sense of the terrible environment that these men were faced with. It is hard to imagine such things happening and the sacrifices fellow soldiers made for one and another. In a world of ""givers and takers"" the Ghost Soldiers were ""true givers"".If you do not shed tears when reading this book, you have missed it.What is most sad is that in Japan these stories are not told. Maybe the internet will bring this shame home to them.It should be mandatory required reading for every high school student. What is learned in this book will never [and should never] be forgotten. Every parent should stimulate their children to learn more about the young and innocent men and women who gave so much for their country at a time when duty was self-evident.Our country would be a better place if those ""heros"" were around today."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting,"I was suprised how much of the book was devoted to Bataan death march and the life of the POWs in the Cabanatuan camp. The chapters go back and forth between the actual rescue and the story of how the POWs got there, etc. The camp raid itself was probably only about 50% of the book.And I have to agree with another reviewer -- the author seemed to be giving excuses for the Japanese soldiers and officers who committed so many atrocities in the Phillipines. (Reading the back, I saw that the author spent a lot of time getting the Japanese side of the story from ex-soldiers and Japanese historians.)Still, it was an interesting book about the POWs and everything they went through."
3,Ghost Soldiers,"This book chronicles the horrific story of the Bataan death march, the treatment of American, British, Dutch, Australian, and Norwegian POWs in the Philippines, as well as the Philippine resistance very well. Also fairly well documented is the cultural rift between the Far East and the West prior to, and during the Second World War.Hampton Sides' writing style is, at times, frustrating. It is obvious that Mr. Sides is not a military historian. It appears that he often tries to compensate for his lack of knowledge by using bombastic terminology, and over-intellectualizing easily explained facts and events.I believe that first reading Flags of Our Fathers and Flyboys, both by James Bradley, will make Ghost Soldiers much better understood by the reader.Regardless, this is a must read for anyone interested in WWII history."
5,Don't miss the experience...,"I'm not a fan of War stories or history books. I am not easily moved emotionally. I read this because it seemed like an interesting story. I was astounded by this book. It actually gave me chills in the end. It was shocking how cruel the Japanese captors were to the Americans and gave me a deep respect for the American POW's of World War II. The book is well researched, intelligently written and emotionally stimulating. It reads like a fast paced action novel, the character development makes you feel like you know these people personally and the mood of dread, fear and hope are touchingly communicated to the reader. Don't get me wrong, this is not a tear jerker story, it is an accurate account of history as told by people who actually lived through the ordeal. It has intrigue, spies, guerrillas, culture clashes, desperation and most of all - courage. It is a rewarding read in the end and an adventure from the beginning. Highly recommended!"
4,I didn't know that!,"A wonderful and exciting history lesson of the WWII events in the Philipines. Until Ghost Soldiers my only image of this part of the world during the war was General McCarthur wading through the surf with a corn cob pipe clenched between his teeth. I didn't know that the Death March of Bataan took place in the Philipines, and I thought Mucci was an Italian food delicay not a daring, dashing colonel in the Rangers. The author clearly did in depth research and he wove together a number of parallel stories, and actions without confusing the reader, and at the same time he energized the prose and narratives to keep the pages turning at a furious pace. My enthusiasm has sold at least two additional copies plus my copy is on its second loan out.Great, gutsy reading for any season."
5,"Seen it, but didn't Realize!","I've actually been to Corregidor island and to the memorial outside Manila where thousands of white crosses stand in formation, but I have never understood the historical significance until this book. From the first page, I was glued to this book like none other I've read. It's ashamed that theses events in the Phillippines were pushed aside so quickly after they occurred because of other major events concluding the war. Effects of these soldiers' presence still lingers, especially in rural areas. Being an obvious American, Philipino kids liked to yell out ""hey Joe!"" (in reference to GI Joe, our soldiers in WWII) to get my attention. And this was 60+ years after the events written.This is a very well composed book and I have been recommending it at every chance I get."
4,Very well written,"This is a fascinating, extremely well-written (an easy read) book about an interesting subject (though I hear the movie based on the book is not very good). I am giving it 4 1/2 stars rather arbitrarily, because the author does not appear to be a professional historian, does appear to make a few historical errors, and because I like to save 5 stars for professional historians. After all, they make less money than regular authors and have to teach students for a living on top of that!"
4,Held my interest,This was a great book that held my interest cover to cover. I can't wait to see the movie!!
4,Outstanding seller,"Smooth transaction from start to finish. Quick shipment, excellent packaging, nice book. Strongly recommend this seller. A+++++"
3,Heartbreaking -,This book depicts one of the most heartbreaking episodes of WWII in the Pacific.What is notable about this book is the author's attempt to get the Japanese side of the tragedy and think about why many of the U.S. soliders captured in the Philippines were mistreated.Great book -
5,Wow.,"This book was ""hard to put down"" and ""hard to pick up"". The descriptions were horribly graphic and made it difficult to read at times. However, the book was a testimony to the will of the American soldiers."
5,Rescue of the last survivors of the Bataan Death March,"Hampton Sides does an exceptional job of bringing this story to life.I did not know about this rescue mission until I picked up his book.You get to know these people, what happened to them, how they dealt with everything, and how they crafted ways to survive.Parts of the story are truly shattering, but the planning of the mission and the carrying it out took incredible courage.It's one of those books you don't want to put down."
5,Fantastic book,"This should be read by every high school student in the USA; actually every American living free. What a book!!! It is hard to put down. It tells of a true WWII rescue mission that is beyond belief, truly epic in nature. It also speaks to the horrible way our POW's were treated by the Japanese. Thank God we bombed the hell out of them for the war crimes (sadistic torture) commited against our POW's, not just for the sake of revenge, but also to end the war FAR quicker to save thousands of American lives."
4,Better Than The Movie,"Hampton Sides' telling of the rescue of 500 POWS, survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March, by U.S. Army Rangers in the Philippines during the waning days of World War II is an outstanding job of reportage. Sides tells the story from the eyes of the rescued and their rescuers, building suspense that wasn't always present in the The Great Raid, the film adaptation of his story. As a working journalist for more than 30 years, I know I good story when I read one, and this one falls into that category."
4,A Part Of History,"I bought this book after a friend recommended it to me. She knew that my father survived the Bataan Death March & was a POW for almost 3 years, had been held at the Cabantuan prison camp & was there when this rescue took place. Funny to see the postcard shown in the book and I have the same one my father sent all those years ago.My father is gone now, I only wish he could have read this book. It took years but at the urging of his family he finally wrote down in journal form the suffering and cruelty he received and saw handed out.As the years went by his one great saddness was the fact that so many people, adults among them, had never even heard of the Bataan Death March. This is some small part of history that should be taught to our school children in a history class, but for some reason has been neglected.Thank-you Hampton Sides for bringing this true life story to generations of people.Renee Salewsky"
5,"Riveting, wrenching stuff","The great men who fought selflessly against Japan have a trustworthy champion in Hampton Sides, and one cannot but wish they were still here to be thanked. Sides brings to vivid life a horrendous ordeal. I was especially moved by soldier Henry Lee's poetry and will see if my library can obtain his posthumously-published, buried under a prisoner shack in palm-leaves volume ""Nothing But Praise."""
3,My impression of Ghost Soldiers,I really enjoyed the meat of the book but the author took to many rambling side trips. The actual mission the newly formed rangers went on to rescue the prisoners of war was great. There were real personal feelings of many men narrated with skill. I did object to reading several hundred pages of other stories of the Far East War interjected in between the story of the ghost soliders. I would recommend reading the book as other readers may enjoy reading the history of the Philippine Campaign as much of the war is covered in this book
3,SLOW READ,"NOT AS FUN TO READ AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, THE BOOK FAILED TO CAPTURE THE DRAMA OF THE FIGHT. MORE INPUT FROM THOSE WHO WERE THERE PLEASE."
2,Pretentious and Boring,"Despite what the tag line promises, this is not an epic story of WW II's most dramatic mission. It is ridicuous to even suggest such a thing. At best this is a superficial recounting of a late war mission which turned out not to be not nearly as dangerous as it could have been. The bravery of the men who took part in the raid cannot be questioned. However, there are countless other tales of WW II that recount much more horrificly dangerous events than the one depicted here. The book simply fails to deliver. If you are looking for a gripping tale of the horror and heroism that defined WW II this is not the one."
2,Okay retelling full of stuff recycled from other WWII accounts,I found very little original and this book felt like a hollywood type treatment with lots of back and forth between the camp and the evolving rescue operations. I prefer books with alot more scholarly research others may be more interested in dramatic story telling (not that dramatic).
2,too much,It was a good true life story of which we don't have enough of.....but the author drug this out way.....tooo far. The subject was one we all need to know but it did not hold my attention because in my mind it was poorly written.
5,Courage in the Philippines in World War II,"This is an exciting and uplifting story about courage in the Philippines in World War II. The book is about a little known event in early 1945 when 100+ men from the 6th Ranger Battalion saved 500+ men from a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Cabantuan. There was every expectation that the Japanese were going to execute these prisoners like they had done to others. However, the 6th Ranger Battalion had other thoughts on this. The story of how this event transpires made it hard to put the book down. I couldn't put the book down, because the writing style kept me interested and the changes in the story kept me wondering how it would end. This is a great story and the book does a great job of telling it. I highly recommend this book."
4,Ghost Soldiers,"Hampton Sides writes of a harrowing escape mission in the book Ghost Soldiers. He tells of a group of brave Rangers in the American Army who risk their lives to save the last remaining soldiers of the Bataan Death March. Throughout the book, you read about the Rangers Mission from start to finish and from the prisoners view as well. It switches back and forth until finally the camp is liberated from the Japanese. Heroes can be found everywhere, whether it be Colonel Mucci, the man who lead the operation, Clara Fuentes, who risked her life to smuggle information, food, and items to the prisoners, Captain Prince, Dr. Hibbs and so many more. Each person has their own story to tell and each had a very important role that led to the liberation of the camp at Cabanatuan. Even though the ending was no secret, it was hard to put the book down because it detailed the mission so well that I had to know what exactly was planned next."
5,A compelling read...terrible event and beautifully told,"I read this after reading ""Unbroken"" by Laura Hillenbrand, which is the best book I've ever read, and this book is also fantastic. What a tale of courage & strength by our WWII men. Very inspiring."
5,Eye-Opening in More Ways Than One,"""Ghost Soldiers"" is one of those rare books that immediately arrests your attention and doesn't loosen its hold until the final page. Hampton Sides has resurrected a long-forgotten story of the liberation of Bataan Death March survivors from a POW camp in the Philippines.What makes the narrative especially gripping is Sides' skillful technique of alternating the storyline between the pitiful fate of the U.S. soldiers held in captivity, and the cunning preparation and daring execution of plans to liberate them three years later.For me, the book was truly eye opening in more ways than one. Not far from my parents' Connecticut home, there's a highway named after Colonel Henry Mucci. I had often wondered who he was and what he'd done to merit such acclaim. Thanks to ""Ghost Soldiers"" I wonder no longer."
5,Fantastic Story,"Really a well-written and easily followed book. One of the most incredibly true and brave events of WWII, I had a hard time putting this one down. Mr. Sides has thoroughly researched his subjects and included a large number of first person accounts of the events as they're described. This one's a keeper."
5,Ghost Soldiers,"This book is amazing. I appreciated the parallel story lines with the rescuers and the prisoners. This allowed me to breathe. When I first read this book, I was so emotionally involved, I had to put it down periodically for awhile to gather myself. There were times when I couldn't see the page. My mother was different, she was so gripped she couldn't put it down and read it straight through without stopping. Hampton Sides does a great job in creating a vivid picture of the realities of this aspect of the war. Yet, he doesn't go into the blood and guts and gore. He left a lot to the imagination. I appreciated that because my imagination is enough. I truly think that this book is a tribute to the soldiers, rescuers, the kind Japanese, and everyone who bravely faced the horrors of war. I highly recommend this book to any historian."
5,"I am not a war buff, but what a read!","Hampton Sides writes a captivating report on the lives and conditions that all parties endured during the Phillipine occupation during WWII. It would be easy to bash the enemy, but Sides relays how culture and circumstances affect peoples actions. The story is entirely captivating from a humanist point of view: how do people react in utterly inhuman conditions? This tale of epic courage it a must read. I have a newly found respect for the human spirit."
5,A terrific narrative,I rate this way up there with other terrific readable historical accounts like Ambrose's D-Day. Author availed himself of many personal interviews/histories which enhanced the telling. A very good read and a very good history.
5,Ghost Soldiers,"I teach English to eighth graders, and we spend a great deal of time on WWII and The Diary of Anne Frank. When school ended, I decided to explore a segment of the war that I am not as familiar with - the men who fought in the Pacific Campaign. Ghost Soldiers was a book I couldn't put down. Yes, I enjoy history, but the author has an excellent way of making the characters important to the reader. One cares about their fate and their past. Also, he successfully builds suspense with each chapter. You know there is going to be a raid, but the journey there is very significant. I highly recommend this book. It is well-written and definitely a story worth telling."
5,The Epic Story of a Most Dramatic Mission in the Philippines,"Great Book! The story begins with a Japanese massacre at a Philippine POW camp. The report by the survivors alarms the US Army;lest it be repeated again. A newly formed Ranger unit is picked for the rescue mission. The book continues with alternate stories and narratives of life at the POW camp and of the preparations of the Ranger unit and the infiltration of the enemy lines. Side stories are included of the Philippine people - their sacrifices and their fondness of Americans. Finally, the Rangers attack and liberate the camp. Philippine guerrillas help block Japanese reinforcements. The book includes many photographs of the Rangers and the prisoners."
4,History we tend to forget,The Pacific theater of WWII is usually forgotten when WWII is discussed. A terrific novel which tells some of the story.
5,A Gripping Tale!,"Another amazing story in the annals of US Military history. I am always intrigued by the bravery of our men at arms. This book tells the forgotten story of WWII prison camps and Japanese atrocity. While it's heart rending to read of our young men being beheaded by brutal enemy soldiers or stabbed to death with sabers, it's important to remember that the reality of war often exposes the savagery of men.Ghost Soldiers is a gripping tale of heroism and endurance, you will weep for the young prisoners as they die at the hands of their Japanese captors and rejoice when the Ranger Battalion finally reaches them in the most daring rescue of World War II. I strong recommend this book to any avid reader of military non-fiction. It is very well written, fast paced and historically accurate. Add it to your library proudly."
4,Another great read from Hampton Sides,"The nonfiction story form works best when it's by Hampton Sides. Engaging throughout, it is the heroic WWII story of a collection of Americans and Filipinos and their attempt to rescue POWs about to be slaughtered by the Japanese in retreat. This should definitely be a movie."
5,No longer a forgotten WWII story,"One of the most incredible events of WWII has also been one of the least known or reported. With ""Ghost Soldiers"" Hampton Sides has introduced us to the brave men of the U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion who marched thiry miles through the jungles of the Phillipines to rescue 513 men (the survivors of the Bataan Death March) held prisoner by the Japanese.Combining eyewitness accounts with detailed research, ""Ghost Soldiers"" tells us the story of all those involved; the brave rescuers, the resilient prisoners, and the villagers who risked everything to help.Full of unspeakable atrocities and acts of bravery that will make you nearly stand up and cheer, ""Ghost Soldiers"" ranks near the top in World War II literature.Highly Recommended"
5,Ghost Soldiers,"Not for the faint of heart or politically correct. I learned about the death march but never heard of the daring rescue mission, until reading this book. Told my father about it and he stole it so he could enjoy it as well. Men like these are why it is called ""Americas Greatest Generation"""
4,"Great story, great storyteller","Considering that this the author's first foray into historical writing (that I'm aware of), I think this is a terrific book.The book consists of two main stories, told in tandem: that of the Cabanatuan prisoners and that of the mission to rescue them. Each chapter brings the two stories closer until they eventually merge as one.Contrary to the previous reveiwer's comments, I don't think every historical author should mold themselves after the great Steven Ambrose. If you want Stephen Ambrose, read Stephen Ambrose (who, as yet, has not done a Pacific Campaign book).If you're interested in a fascinating story, written by a very good author, check this book out."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,I thought that I would not like this book and even talked myself into hating it when we chose it for our book club. I was pleasantly surprised because not only did I like this book -- I could not put it down! I will be giving a few copies for Christmas presents.
1,tattered,I bought this as a gift for a family member and it came all tattered and used looking. I ended up giving it to Goodwill.
5,impowering to read,this book is superbly written so you can feel what event took place makes you feel as if you were there..
2,"""Trudging Through the Philippines""","The book starts out with a BANG, and makes you feel that you have a winner. Once past the beginning, the book crawls along until the closing attack. Far too much detail about unimportant things, and too little about the specific prison enviornment. If you, or a loved one were there, the book is a ""must read"". If you weren't there, don't waste your time visiting. Larry Woodfield"
2,Bad writing mars interesting story,The writer's mother must have been bitten by a rabid adjective while she was carrying him. The resulting affliction also badly skewed his knowledge of the precise meanings of some of the words he used as adverbs. The story of the miserable plight of the prisoners held by the Japanese at the end of WWII deserves better treatment.
2,Peter Straub would be ashamed!,"Ok, here we go. And believe me, I'll try to keep the invective minimized. I read the ""Original"" Ghost Story, by Peter Straub some years ago, and let me say gang it was a classic with a capital K!! Gave me the creeps for months. So imagine to my delight that Master Straub's original notion had been reconstructed during the big one. (That's WW2 to the uninformed) Well my only comment is that this is a poor excuse for a sequel. Not a bad war story, but can't hold a candle to the original. Happy reading to all of my good friends here at Amazon.com. Keep the rubber side down and I'll see you at Sturgis."
1,Improper Research,"I can't imagine a book like this without an index or notes. A book is not a magazine, and a buyer is entitled to these services. What value to serious readers of history can this book have? The author admits that it was a ""half-baked"" e-mail idea at the start. More serious writing and editing could have made it less so as a book. I had reason to want to find references to Colonel Mucci. Impossible without an index. The author opens himself up to the charge of leaning too heavily on previous sources without notes and a bibliography. Perhaps a better editor could have guided this writer better. This story seems rushed out so it could be made into a movie. We'll have to see, but nevertheless there are some things that do not need to be ghosts in a work like this. The subject demanded more."
5,Compelling Non-Fiction,"Hampton Sides' GHOST SOLDIERS reads like an action / thriller. I had to remind myself that it was a Non fiction account of actual events. Larger than life yet unsung heroes such as Captain Robert Prince remind us that World War II was won by common people doing uncommon things in obscurity. The American Rangers and Phillipino guerrilla fighters pulled off a rescue mission worthy of any Hollywood production. With Steven Ambrose's BAND OF BROTHERS, THE WILD BLUE, and D-DAY, this outstanding work illustrates the importance of front line soldiers improvising techniques to accomplish their mission. Anyone interested in World War II will love this book. I think it would make a great movie"
3,"Compelling, Detailed, Evangelical","Ghost Soldiers is a detailed and compelling story about war camp rescue. It includes a dizzying array of colorful characters, detailed and intertwined in a complex story of survival and liberation.However, the real theme of the book is God saves. There are so many overt, awkward religious references that it doesn't take long for the subtext to become distracting. It feels artificial.I've read quite a number of non-fiction and fiction survival stories from WWII. In regard to the poetic nature of the prose, this book ranks up with the Disney-Film-Ready book Unbroken. It's marvelous detail outpaces The Great Escape.Unfortunately, it left me feeling like someone was trying to sell me religion, without being honest enough to say so."
3,Great Story...Decent Storytelling,"Mr. Sides brings us a wonderful - and horrific - story from World War II. Whenever I have heard the word ""Bataan"", my mind always fills in ""Death March"". This book filled in some gaps and gives us a personal account of some of the survivors and their rescuers.That Mr. Sides does not have the storytelling ability of a Stephen Ambrose is not to disparage him in any way. This book is good, if not as emotionally engaging as it possibly could have been. I must admit that perhaps the author should be thanked for keeping us somewhat distant, the experiences of the prisoners are not for the faint of heart.I recommend this book to all World War II historical nuts, like myself, and would only add that absolutely anyone who reads this will discover nothing but courage from the men involved. Who was more brave, the POW's or the Rangers? It doesn't matter, they're all worthy of the title ""Hero""."
5,One of the best WWII available,"Two books (IMO) stand head and shoulders above the heap of WWII reads. Flyboys is one, Ghost Soldiers is the other. The End"
1,Lousy printing,"It's incredible that Amazon.com sells such a badly printed book. While the lousy printing is painfully evident in both the text and the photographs, it is the photographs where the reader suffers it the most: more than seen, the photographs have to be imagined. Since I've seen some of them in other books and the quality was fine, the poor quality cannot be blamed on the original photographs! It's really a shame."
1,This book is a print-on-demand edition,This book was originally published in France in 1996 in a conventional edition. Since 1999 this print-on-demand edition has also been available. That accounts for its poor printing quality as noted by the previous reviewer.
5,Purcell's King Arthur,"Purcell's opera King Arthur is superbly brought to life by this excellent recording. The English Baroque Players (with period instruments) play beautifully and each of the vocal soloists is excellent. What struck me most, was the variety of dynamics, which along with the character of the music come across very well."
1,Hate this Nutri-Vet Pet Ease Plus,I have used Feliway Comfort Zone off and on for years in a multi cat household. I recently bought this because it was so much cheaper. I HATE it. Its only been plugged in for and hour and my whole house stinks like a medical facility. There is no odor with Comfort Zone. When I first plugged it in mt cats were sniffing the air then started getting more hyper. Now my female is trying to pick a fight with her sister who is sleeping. Its like it intensified the territorial tension. This product is nothing like the Feliway pheromones and is deceptive in their wording. Its only a mix of herb oils. What a waste of my money. I would give it zero stars if I could.
3,unsure of results,bought to end bullying of one cat toward another but couldn't really see any difference after a month so I don't know if it had any effect
1,"smells good, but doesn't do the job","I bought this in an attempt to keep my new cat and old cat from fighting with each other...but it did not work. It made the house smell nice, but the cats still fight right in front of the machine!"
1,Just an Expensive Outlet Device,"I have 2 cats that fight/play, especially at night, so I got it to help me sleep at night. With a loft style apartment I cannot lock the cats out of my bedroom and got this product in hopes they would not trample on me when playing chase or scrimmaging late at night. After 2 weeks of having the plug-in placed by my bed, there has been no change to the late night feistiness. I would not even consider this a room freshener as stated by a previous review. I smell no fragrance except when a few inches away from unit. I gave product 1 star as it may have had a small undetectable change in behavior."
3,don't know if it does anything,"I bought all 3 of these products, the spray, the paste that they eat, and the room diffuser. My cat does not care for the spray, she won't go anywhere I spray it. As far as the room diffuser, I can't tell if that did anything for her or not, and it is not very strong like some reviews say, it has a light citrus/herbal scent. As far as the paste, my cat LOVES that stuff, she starts to meow and comes running when I get the tube out and I put it on my finger and she licks it right off, but again I don't know if it does anything to help calm her down. I bought all of these in preparation for moving to a new apartment and wanted to use them at the new place, I did plug in the diffuser on the first day and had been giving her some of the paste every night starting before the move. It took her a few days to get used to the new place but I think that was just her. So I dont know if these products really work."
5,Feast of the senses...,"Lisa Aschmann produces this repast with a deep soulful voice and an intricate subtlety of emotional flavor. Her lyrics serve up not only clever concoctions of rhythm and style, but a heartfelt seasoning of hope, love, and an honest joy that can only be described as delicious.With her powerful blues voice and a healthy dose of humor, she makes something rich and real and full of life. You can hear the lessons of pain and love that haunt her past, but always the delight and hope that moves her is shared through the language of her music. She is bright and alive and fully aware of the path she has taken. This Creation is honest and heartfelt and I for one, am proud to own it.From the fun of Walkin' My Baby Home, to the sadness and longing of One Mile Apart, Lisa shows us a deceptively simple reflection of her own life. The more you look, the more you see, and if you pay close attention, the more you'll understand."
2,Yawn,"I'm no expert on film, much less French New Wave. I just like to explore a bit. So I picked this up because I heard it was considered to be influential, and because the idea of Richard Crenna being in something like this struck me as amusing. I liked the ocean/siren bit at the beginning quite a lot, but the ultra-slow pace lost me soon after that. It's also a bit difficult to watch the train/helicopter bit at the end with an unjaded eye. It just didn't captivate me."
3,"Not the Best, Not the Worst","First of all, I am completely familiar with Neurosis. I own all albums from this one to Sun that Never Sets. While Neurosis is far from my favorite band(I pull their CD's out for an occasional listen), I find myself captivated by the atmosphere they create. Yes, they can be very boring and they are overly repetitive. But they are extremely original. While I prefer my music with more speed and aggression(Immortal, At the Gates ) or acoustics(Opeth) or melodicism (Diabolical Masquerade, Dissection), I do enjoy their combination of quiet somber licks combined with apocalyptic drumming. While I prefer Enemy of the Sun or Through Silver in Blood, I do pull this one out every once in a while."
1,Trash,"These guys might just be the worst band I've ever heard both live and recorded!!! Awful!!! And it's not like I haven't given them a chance. I've only returned one CD in my life because I hated it and was ""Times of Grace"" by these guys and this album is no better. Listen to some real hardcore/metal like V.O.D."
5,"Great album, and my person favorite from the group","This was the first album where neurosis left behind their punk/hardcore origins and moved into the hard rock/metal/trance type music. Here they slowed down many of the melodies/tempos, blended it with areas of fast/loud punk inspired vocals, and a new sound for the rest of their next few albums are born. Songs like ""To crawl under one's skin"", ""souls at zero"", and ""Sterile Vision"" also start adding in samples and violins, where before neurosis hadn't even crossed this path.Overall, there are not weak points in this album for me. That is why this is in my top 10 albums to have if stuck on a desert island, if not the number one album. Souls at Zero was the fist track I ever heard from this band in 1991, and it blew me away. I hope you will be amazed by this album as much as I still am. A must have for a neurosis fan."
2,Preprogramed,"It feels too much like a by the numbers plot. A villian among the good guys. Traitors to the cause. Way too much coincidence. We learn a little about computer history, but not much more."
3,Entertaining,"Being the first Deaver's novel I've read, I wasn't sure what to expect. While the story was somewhat engrossing and I HAD to finish certain chapters, overall the book was average.Another in a line of endless serial killer junk, not just deavers, the suprise ending was disappointing and the demise of the antagoinist was anti-climatic.While I know nothing of hacking, I found the subject matter interesting, but it often seemed the author was showing off knowledge and geekdom prevailed.Not a bad read."
2,A Mishmash of styles,It is hard to figure who Deaver is pitching this book out to.Savvy Computer users or his usual audience of airport stand readers. If it's the latter they'll be put off with the technical terminology - it's hard to make computer's [desirable](probably why there are so few movies with nerds as heroes).For computer literate people (such as myself I hope)explaining every computer term used at length makes the pacing slow. It just seems the book is so much padding and should have done with some editorial pruning.Unlike an earlier reviewer I'm a third of the way through the book and I feel I have some inkling as to who this mysterious Shawn is. This person's so incompetent that either he's crooked or going to be killed off in a later chapter. Maybe I'm wrong.Deaver should stick to his Lincoln Rhyme novels.
1,The Blue Nowhere,"I got hooked on Deaver's books by the reading ""The Bone Collector"". Once I find an author I like, I'll order most of their previous works and then anxiously await their new publication. This one I could have passed on. If you're a computer geek, it may be for you, though you'll probably get just as confused as I did because I think Deaver got confused with the terminology. Not a well thought out novel as far as his characters go. Confusing, not well thought out characters - confused and disappointed reader."
1,This book is awesome. This $110.95 audio-CD is a TOTAL RIPOFF,Is this a joke? Amazon wanting $110.95 for an audio CD of this book ? Is it diamond-encrusted? Coated in gold leaf? Surely that must be the most expensive audio CD of all time.
4,"Page turner, good read ...","I find this book to be entertaining, page turner and a good read. I didn't mind the jargon, all I'm interested was the story itself. At least, I learned some few computer lingos and that was quite interesting too. I enjoyed reading it, a whole lot better than Empty Chair, that's for sure."
3,This ain't no Bone Collector or Coffin Dancer...,"Okay Jeffery, I wasn't too crazy about The Empty Chair; but I gave you another shot... Well, The Blue Nowhere ain't no Bone Collector. And it certainly ain't no Coffin Dancer. If I'd wanted to learn everthing there is to know about computers I would've bought a *Dummies* book. --Whatever happened to character development? Furthering a plot line? Creating atmosphere? Building suspense? These were afterthoughts in a book that read like a text on internet crime."
3,"Go back to writing Lincoln Rhyme novels, Mr Deaver.....","It's definitely what you do best.As with ""The Devil's Teardrop"", there are incredible gaps in the plot - and unlike ""Teardrop"", in some cases Deaver doesn't explain what happened during these gaps or refer back to them in any way.But what he does cover in ""The Blue Nowhere"" is a rollicking good read nevertheless, not to mention frightening - and this book is definitely worth recommending.Deaver does need to go back over his notes in ""how to write a mystery novel"", though - his Lincoln Rhyme novels are proof that he knows how to do it, but so far his non-Rhyme stories look like they were written by a completely different, completely amateurish person masquerading as Jeffery Deaver. Social engineering, perhaps?"
2,To many improbablities,"This book started out well for me but the improbable story lines keep piling on. The villain, as described, is a supergenius in the cyber world who spends much of his waking time behind a computer screen creating mayhem. In the real world he is quite ordinary, not at all physically fit. Yet in the physical confrontations with pursuing police officers he continually comes out on top? This is just one of the elements that I found improbable."
4,Fast paced thriller!,"Wyatt Gilette, an imprisoned hacker, is asked to help police solve a crime involving computers. Murders are being committed by Phate, a mysterious hacker who has full knowledge of his victims because of a program he wrote to invade their computers. For Phate, this is a game, not real life and each new victim is just another 'level' for him. This book is full of twists and turns and it'll keep you guessing right until the very end."
2,Definitely not a true book,"This book has to many things that are completely wrong, for example: in this book there is a fight between a hacker ( who was in jail) and a cracker who wants to kill people like a computer's game, the hacker sent an email with a virus to control the hard disk of the cracker and to know where he is, you think that a cracker will not have an antivirus in his computer?When the cracker found the hacker, all he wanted to do is kill him, he has two opportunities and he didn't kill him because...It was also another woman who wanted the programs of the cracker, and when were the three of them she didn't kill the hacker why?...I put this book 2 stars because just writing a book deserve 2 stars.If you want to read a book of the net that could be real and amazing, read: Don't Talk to Strangers by Bethany Campbell"
2,"Plot is weak, tech knowledge weaker","Sorry folks, you can't repeatedly build suspense by having the good guys run to the place the bad guy ""just was"". It's too predictable. And the technology was often laughable. Trapdoor apparently makes the characters on the screen fuzzy! What a riot! Sure, and good hackers can really ""feel"" the diffenrece in their keystrokes when their machine is running anything funny! As if you can't simply put a sniffer on a communications line to see if someone is stealing away your data. Just a few examples of the ""gee whiz factor"" gone wild in Mr. Deaver's head. And in the epilog he want us to believe that there is real dange in all this [...]. Indeed there is, but there's a far greater danger from hacks like the auther disseminating rubbish than from the hackers themselves!"
5,a brilliant book,"I am a big fan of Jeffery Deaver, but I admit to liking his stand-alone books better than ones from the Lincoln Rhyme series.The Blue Nowhere races along and the thrills keep coming. He is a master story teller, and his attention to detail in research really shows.In fact, he's got me almost paranoid about using the internet for anything. When he can take something we use every day and turn it into the scariest weapon known to man, he's done a great writing job.Without plot spoiling, this has the usual twists and turns at the end!!A must read for Deaver fans and any crime fiction lover."
3,legends of the super-hackers,"With everyday somebody falling to some con spam computer crime isreal: just probably nothing like what this books claims.Crime is a world of it's own.Here we have the super-hacker Wyatt Gillette fighting the evil killer""kracker"" Phate and his partner Shawn.The police have an corporate spy as well trying to get the ""Trapdoor"" software.Since this was published the many holes in Windows have beenexposed. What I most dislike about this story is thatit makes these fellows seem to be able to leap Internet mountain in a single bound.Mostly the government knows about somebody that can do this,they would be spending more time/ money tracking them downthan they really do.The story is just for reading fun mostly, since in most cases,it is just much harder than this to get into most systems online."
4,A Most Interesting Premise,"The writer can be depended upon to construct a story thas taut with most interesting characters. He is consistently able to write a story that is rapidly paced and is a most enjoyable read. This reviewer finds that in novels where the writer is able to remove himself from his charater such as Lincoln Rhyme that the book is not formulaic and is a much better read. Although depth is lacking in many of the characters in this book, I found that it was a cleverly crafted work. It holds the interest of the reader with numerous twists that kept this reader guessing throughout the novel. Although this is one of Deaver's earler works, it is one of his strongest. It is well researched and informs the reader about cyberspace and the inherent dangers that lack therein. It makes for a most satisfying and enjoyable read."
1,For computer fans only,"I eagerly await this author's books, but this book was terrible unless your a computer junkie. Way too much computer information given which made the book almost unbearable to read. And as for all the plot twists, come on. Two or three would have been okay, but there must have been six or more. Never built the characters either, couldn't remember who was who."
3,Weaker Deaver,"This is the third book I have read by Deaver. While the others have been thoroughly entertaining, this one has been a bit of a disappointment. While still suspenseful and loaded with the twists that Deaver is good at, there are definite storytelling flaws in this book.Deaver does not do a great job with characterization in this story. Beyond the two principal characters, most of the characters are rather weak. More grating is the amount of space that Deaver takes to explain computer concepts; while I understand that the jargon makes the story more realistic, he is unable to convey the meaning of the jargon in a smooth fashion. Instead, he is constantly having characters explain to other characters what certain terms mean.Deaver has shown that he is a more skilled writer than he is in this work, but there is still enough entertainment value in this book to make it a decent but not great read."
4,Kept my interest,"The first book I ever read by Deaver was ""The Bone Collector."" That sets an almost impossibly high standard for any books that follow.Blue Nowhere doesn't really measure up to Bone Collector. However, judged on its own merits, I found it to be interesting and fast-paced enough to keep my interest.The main problem I had with it was the constant explanation of computer terms in the first third of the book. I realize that from the publisher's point of view it was probably necessary, but it did tend to get distracting.If you got here and are reading this, you know enough about the Internet to enjoy this book. If you know a whole lot more, you can most likely point out factual errors/inconsistencies. I didn't find that this detracted from the story.Overall, not his best. But even ""not the best"" Deaver is pretty good."
2,The Blue Notworthwastingyourtime,"Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read ""The Coffin Dancer"" instead."
1,Where are Frank and Joe when you need them?,"A recent favourable review in a national magazine made me think this would be an enjoyable summer read. A police procedural set around computer hacking sounded promising. Unfortunately this was not the case due to generally dreadful writing, cardboard characterizations, and pacing (if it can be called that) which manages to be uniformly dull. This is the kind of book that makes memories of the Hardy Boys seem like literary masterpieces in comparison. My first, and last Deaver, I think."
2,More than you ever want to know about computers,"This newest Jeffrey Deaver novel is quite a departure from his previous books.Multiple characters are involved, with minimal character development of any other than Gillette, the convicted hacker who turns away from the dark side to help hunt down the killer. Most of the action centers on the use of various computer programs,tricks, whatever you want to call all the technical descriptions, which are put into layman's language, but is still more than I ever wanted to know about computers. At the book's end, there is a bad guy still unaccounted for, who is loose with the ""Trapdoor"" program.....I hope this doesn't mean that Mr. Deaver intends to write a sequel to this story."
4,A good Deaver novel,Wyatt Gillette is a hacker serving a year in prison when he's released temporarily by the California state police to help find a murderous hacker known as 'Phate'. The setting of course is in Silicon Valley. This is a highly suspenseful novel filled with some interesting twists. There are a lot of computer and hacking themes throughout the whole book but it's made easy to follow and understand by the author-even for the computer illiterate. A good suspenseful read.Recommended.
3,Enjoyable throwaway from a writer capable of so much more...,"Having thoroughly enjoyed two earlier Deaver efforts, ""The Bone Collector"" and especially ""The Coffin Dancer,"" I was looking forward to ""The Blue Nowhere."" Unfortunately, while this novel has some interesting ideas and scenes, it doesn't have nearly the shelf life of Deaver's better works. Deaver usually does twists well, and while a few of them work here, a few also misfire badly, and the climax feels more than a little rushed. This is a standalone book and thus doesn't feature Deaver's two best characters, Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs; you can almost feel the writer straining to interest himself in the characters here, but the same enthusiasm with which Deaver concocts the exploits of Rhyme and Sachs never makes it to these pages. ""The Blue Nowhere"" is a good diversion, but highly disposable; good for beach reading but I doubt you'll ever go back to it."
3,Intro to computing,"This book is OK and has a few twists which are standard in a suspense drama. The annoying thing is that the author gives any remotely technical word a large description. This is probably smart from his point of view since this allows the book to be readable to a wider audience, but if you know the basics about computer networks it gets tedious. I only picked it up because I wasn't smart enough to buy a book before going to the airport and I needed something to get me thru a 6 hour flight."
2,Trying to get on the Cyber bandwagon -- and failing,"I used to be a big Deaver fan -- back when he wasn't deliberately trying to write ""bestsellers."" Check out his older books -- the location scout series written under the name William Jefferies are particularly good.It seems like once Deaver got his Hollywood deal (The Bone Collector) he started writing for mass consumption instead of sticking to things that inspire him.My sense after reading this book is that the ""cyber"" theme is forced ... selected merely for its sales appeal, and not because it is of particular interest to the author. I had the same feeling after reading his last two ""blockbuster"" novels -- they are well-crafted mimics of other bestsellers, and have resulted in big sales at the sacrifice of creativity."
2,"Full of tricks to keep you turning the pages, but why?","This novel keeps you turning the pages even though you know you're being ""had"" and that after all the build up, the ending can't be anything other than a let-down.I am a Silicon Valley computer professional and agree with all the other reviews about the technology being laughably wrong.Yes, there's a lot of action in this book, but I found it to be contrived. The characters run all over the Valley (picture the Keystone Cops), usually for no reason other than to be in a place so they can get into trouble. I kept reading only to learn who the villain's accomplice was. That story line was done well, I thought, classic mystery, making you suspect just about everybody, no matter how crazy it seemed. In the end though, I felt like I'd wasted my time reading this book."
1,Huh?,"The only way someone can read this novel is if they know almost nothing about computers.Deaver really needed a technical editor to go over the manuscript. He takes real terms and applies them incorrectly and the technology isn't realistic at all: example PHATE is on a cellphone modem connection for 52mins and downloads ""gigabytes"" of data -- ah, no...you'd be lucky to download a few megs. Also Gillette ""hears"" pings when tracing PHATE. When connected to supercomputers PHATE ""dials"" into other supercomputers -- huh? Also, Deaver mixes up the Internet and the Web as if they are the same thing.If you are doing a medical novel, you have to get the medical details right, and if you're doing a book on hacking, you have to get the tech details right as well or it's just silly."
3,An exciting story flawed by lack of research,"The Blue Nowhere is another page-turner from Jeff Deaver, and is hard to put down -- when you can get into the story. Unfortunatly, it can be hard to stay immresed in this one, because some of the inaccuracies are so glareinly obvious. Worse than that, the story hinges on one of these -- as someone who types for a living as the author does (assuming that he does not churn out these books with a quill pen!)must know."
3,"Good story, but...","WAY too much computer technical jargon. I realize that most of us don't know everything about the ""Blue Nowhere"", but character development and story suffered as the author tried to educate all of us ... I have read and re-read all of Mr. Deaver's other books, but this was too exhausting to ever open again."
3,"In retrospect, not so hot....","The publication date for this book is 2002. Reading it now, 10 years later, is undoubtedly a different experience. We've had 10 years of hackers and privacy discussions and lawmaking by political idiots who don't know anything about the internet. The problem is, WE (the 2012 reader) are much more savvy about the setting of this novel. In reading it, I found the characters under-developed and not very interesting: the reason for that is that once Deaver finishes describing the technological background, there isn't much room for anything else. I realized that 10 years ago, the background tutorials would have been fascinating and probably would have carried the reader along, ooooh-ing and ahhh-ing all the way at the wonders of technology to come.Now, of course, the technology has come--and gone. What is left is a familiar, unexciting backdrop for an underdeveloped characterization and superficial plot line. The Blue Nowhere did not stand the test of time."
2,Not Deaver's best work,"The most amusing thing about reading this book in 2011 is that it's ten years old and most, if not all, of the computer-based science and hacking and Internet lingo used by the characters is now outdated. Still, Deaver writes well, and his characters show some depth. Wyatt Gillette, a hacker, is sprung from prison to help a task force find and capture a hacker known only as Phate. Apparently Wyatt and Phate were partners and friends at one time, but Phate has lost sight of reality and has begun killing people IRL (in real life) instead of while playing an MMORPG. There's an unnecessary subplot about Wyatt trying to get back his estranged ex-wife that goes nowhere. However, the true identity of the mole inside the police department who notifies Phate of developments is a great plot twist. However, I'd still recommend the Lincoln Rhyme novels over this any day."
4,Another Winner From Jeffery Deaver!,"This author is one of the finest, past and present. His informed, intelligent writing, for me, is ""scalp tingling"", as well as spine tingling. In this story he leads us through the almost unbelievable technology and complexity of computer hacking. Although at first seemingly challenging to us ""mostly e-mail"" users, he explains the terminology and takes us on a journey, the destination to which it seems impossible to reach."
4,fabulous beach read,"Computer ""geeks"" should not review this book. I am sure that there are many mistakes about computers, but So What?? This is a great mystery, suspense, fast reading book. The characters are real and likeable. There is a lot of information about computers, but its necessary to the story, and anyone reading this review on Amazon knows enough about computers to understand what Deaver is saying. The real story is the tracking down of a serial killer. If one is looking for a great ""beach"" book they could do no better than this."
1,"Leave your brain at the door for this one, tech geeks","As a tecno geek myself, I can't help but say that this book is totally unrealistic and it's obvious that Deaver did only a minimal amount of research for this book. The main premise of the book, that there can be a super-virus that can allow a hacker to ""seize root"" of anyone's computer as soon as they connect to the internet, is totally ridiculous. Deaver shows an appalling lack of computer knowledge. The portrayal of the hackers in this book is completely stereotypical, there are no hackers in the world like the characters in this book. And I've been using computers for 20 years pretty much 10-12 hours a day at work and home, and I still haven't gotten calluses on my fingers from using the keyboard. Nor have my fingers gotten any more ""muscular"". Suspension of disbelief is not enough, the whole premise of the book is built on a foundation of computer-illiteracy."
5,Cover to cover intrigue.,"My first Jeffery Deaver book. Rrecommended by a friend, this book takes place in the Silcon Valley area of California. A short glossary is provided for a few of the techno terms that may be new to the reader. This thriller starts with action from the first chapter and continues with twists, turns and surprises. The abilities of hackers, and crackers give a frightening insight to the dark side of the internet. Nothing appears to be secure. The definition of human life, and virtual life blur in a dark way. This book should be read now, as it will become dated as everything in the technology sector does rapidly."
5,"JD at his best, and you don't have to be a computer geek","Jeff Deaver is the king of plot twists and pace. (Some would argue Patterson is the pace king, but to me Deaver's got it just right). Typical of Deaver, there's no way you can guess the outcome of this marvelous thriller. Blue Nowhere is pure entertainment, as two dueling hackers ""have it on."" One hacker is a serial killer, the other is an ex-con helping the police. Don't expect more than fun, thrills, and surprises. It's a one-night read, only because you won't want to stop. I read mine on the porch in a rainstorm and I never left that porch until it was finished. Classic Deaver, but without Rhyme and Sachs (which is fine, I love them as characters, but I enjoyed the new characters). I suppose the computer technology is, or will soon be, out of date, but that's not fundamental to the story. If you look past the computers, you'll enjoy a non-stop thrill ride."
4,You will never trust your own identity again.,"Jeffrey Deaver does a remarkable job of capturing what is surely becoming the biggest fear of the twenty first century - identity theft. In a labyrinth of computer technology, we are woven into a story where nothing is as it seems, where every time you go online you put your life at risk, and where innocent, unknowing people like ourselves are never safe as long as we own a computer. A mysterious hacker named Phate takes an all too real look at a computer game, and begins to play it in real life. In the game there were points for murder, in life Phate is racking up his own points, slowly winning the game that no one else seems to be playing anymore. In a race for time, one man must pit his own computer expertise against the best, and hope with all his heart that he can stop the killing before Phate becomes master of the game. A stunning thriller, a little jargon that may confuse you, but a story with nightmarish possibilities. Enter at your own risk."
4,Techie Thrills and Kills,"Suspense builds from the first chapter of this thriller and never lets up. Phate is the most evil hacker/cracker you'd ever want to (not) meet, a sociopathic serial killer with an Einsteinian I.Q. Worse, Phate is a screen name; this lunatic could actually be almost anyone . . . anywhere . . . anytime. His more ethical counterpart, Wyatt Gillette, appears to be helping the police and matching moral and technological wits with Phate in an effort to stop him, but Wyatt's motives and connections to Phate are themselves questionable. Little is what it seems in Deaver's high-tech world of mirrors. The only slight distraction is that Deaver frequently detours from the narrative to define techie and hacker terminology. This is probably necessary and enables Deaver to get more deeply technical -- and more believable -- than he might otherwise. In any event, this is a really exciting page-turner."
4,Thriller... Suspense..Twists.. Turns.. This book has it all,"I am a fan of Deaver, so when this came out I just had to pick it up. And I was not disappointed. The plot leaves you wanted more!! The twists and turns make you keep guessing who is real and who is 'socially engineered'. Great book!"
1,Blue in the face,"As a devout follower of Deaver's books, I was very disappointed with his latest novel, 'The Blue Nowhere'. The plot in itself is 'deavious', but this time the style of the writing is, by times, atrocious. Instead of a fastpaced thriller we're in for a rather tedious treat of all the wonders and horrors of internet. I don't mind being informed by an author about a particular subject, but not in the guise of a textbook. There is nothing more deadly for the pacing and credibility of a story when the author turns aside from his subject and informs the reader directly about the aforementioned wonders & horrors of the internet, computers, whatnot, instead of weaving it in the story. For once, the master raconteur has let me down, because this time he has forgotten that a good story must be told, not explained!"
2,Inadvertantly camp,"This is a special kind of movie: amateur, badly acted, poorly written BUT a real period piece and, if you can stand how bad it is as a film, and enjoy it for the camp that it actually is, enjoy!"
1,Takes way too much time to make a point.,"There could have been more about each character, and then they meet, but the characters surrounding the main character were not given a chance to develop or be supporting actors. It was a movie that really didn't know what it wanted to be. It was about so many things that did not tie into the title or a common theme."
1,Another cliche,"All previous reviews with 1 and 2 stars are very accurate. The film is one big cliche about gay life and gay people in general. The acting is nothing. Dialogues are boring and not funny at all.It makes me angry to watch again a movie where almost all gay characters are presented as real camps. They are banal and dull, speaking with this annoying manner.I give one star only for the actor who potrayed Stewart.Don't waste your money on that one."
1,Just plain mean,This movie starts out as a romantic comedy and then does a 180 in the last ten minutes. The movie turns into a really bad drama complete with a performance worthy of a true drama queen. The ending is just plain mean to the viewer!
2,Stereotypical Gay Characters,"This movie reminded me of the series QAF, with characters that you love to hate. Some of the things they have in common:Stereotypical gay characters, lead egocentric characters, over the top drama, and typical bar behavior.In addition this movie adds overbearing gawd-awful music and unrealistic camp in almost every scene.Why did I give it 2 stars? Even though I thought the confrontational ending was a bit over the top, I liked it. The message got through to the audience. I did ask myself, however, why the confronting person felt that he was morally superior when he himself was still lurking in the bar's dark corners.Denial of reality all around here but still worth 2 stars for providing us with *some* hope."
4,A classic look at Gay Life in Boston Mass,"Long before that was Queer as Folk there was All The Rage. Director/Writer/Producer Roland Tec's first effort is a humerious look into being gay in the 90's. The film is funny, well written, and looks very slick for a modest budget independent flick.If you gay, gay curious or questioning you have see All The Rage.The special Directors cut available on the DVD also includes a brilliant round table with average gay men."
3,Narcissistic - Learned a leason the hard way,Narcissistic - I actually enjoyed this film. I can relate to this picture because I've seen the same behavior in both straight and gay friends. The lead I liked to a degree. Narcissistic in some many ways you have to worry who he really is hurting when his world crashes down on him. Learning a lesson the hard way
2,Don't even remember the movie,"I must have rented this a while back but I don't even remember the movie so I really can't review it. However, I do like renting and reviewing gay themed movies but this one doesn't ring a bell. Sorry"
2,Buy this DVD if your desperate to look at half naked men,"Think of this movie as a ""Boys in the Band"" for the early 21st Century. But I don't mean that in a good way. This movie is ridden with gay cliche characters. Everyone in the movie seems to be an eight searching for a ten and no one seems to have any depth or even likeability. Although a couple characters are pleasant to look at, do yourself a favor and buy a porn movie. You'll see better looking guys and you can turn the volume down."
2,Not reall worth the wait,The worst thing about buying an unseen DVD is that you usually get what you paid for. With this film I was truly disspointed. The charaters were wooden just as was the dialog. I was hoping for a movie that was not one of those that left me feeling like what the heck did I just watch. The ending was truly laughable. Before wasting your money I suggest that anyone wanting to purchase this movie view a free copy first
2,"Is there a word I could use that sounds ""nicer"" than LAME?","If there is a nicer, friendlier word to use other than LAME, then I'd like to try for that.But since I can't think of one at the present, lets just say this is one of the most lame movies I've seen in some time. My god...these nice looking but empty creatures in this production could not make it in the world of commercials from what they've shown in this film. Save your time and pass on this one, and certainly do not BUY this piece of junk for you'll hate yourself for years to come if you do.I'm just saying..."
4,Lives of Nuns,Well written....honest and realistic rather than the usual pious types.I'm fascinated that she was able to visit so many different types of convents.
4,Did you ever want to be a nun?,"This book was quick reading. It was very interesting , and the author really went deep into the culture. I'm so glad she wrote this book because I so enjoyed reading it. It's neat to know you can still become a nun until you turn 45 and you don't have to be a virgin...in case anyone is interested!"
3,"A good book, with mediocre photographs","This book shows that not all religious men or women follow the tenets of; Charity, Compassion, Humility, and Poverty...Yet they go forth ruining the name of those who truly feel the calling...I do think the Author had a bias opinion throughout the book, but made good points...Although I only gave it 3 stars it would be more accurate if it was possible to give it 2 1/2 stars the photos were awful, if you want to see good photos this is not the book, but I highly recommend it to those who want to learn a little of the Modern Religious life."
4,Curious about Nuns,"Cheryl Reed is on target with her investigative reporting of the lives of nuns in the United States.This book goes beyond the stereotypes and media portrayal of this group of women. As a protestant, Cheryl Reed asked all the questions that I wanted to know, but was too afraid to ask. This book was interesting and informative, the diversity of nuns was amazing to me. I would advise anyone who was curious about the role of women in the Catholic church take a good look at this book."
2,Carnivores should not write about vegetarians...,"Yo!I would think that someone who was writing a book about Women who have dedicated themselves to lives based on their faith should have more respect for her subject than to refer to an icon of that faith (the Communion wafer) as a cracker.Starting in 1955, I was taught by Nuns for 12 years, the vast majority of them loving, intelligent and caring Women. I freely admit to having those Women as my ideal Nuns.Reeds' book was a treasure trove of the personal stories of Nuns...and ruined for me by having those stories flavored by Reeds' distaste mixed with what seemed to be her dilettante flirtation with a subject much too foreign and complex for her to understand.Reed was emotionally involved enough to keep this from being an investigative book and, I feel, misunderstood her subject at a basic level, making it a difficult book for this 1950's Catholic School Girl to read.--Karen--"
2,A tremendous disappointment,"Intellectual honesty demands that one look at WHY those religious orders which are flourishing are attracting young women while the more progressive orders are withering.Unfortunately, to examine the question is to dare to be politically incorrect, and the author hadn't the wherewithall, apparently, to do that.Without rigorous honesty, what is the point of the book? Very disappointing."
2,She let the good ideas get away,"Although Reed acknowledges that the more conservative orders are currently attracting more new members than the progressive orders, she gives far more attention to the progressive orders and never really examines why they are less successful in attracting new members. Since this information, which I learned for the first time from Reed, is counter intuitive, it seems that the logical course for the book is to examine this discovery in more depth. I would have also liked to read more about the beliefs of the nuns she encountered who worship God in a female form and incorporate Buddhism into their Catholicism. Instead, Reed gives short shrift to these suprising discoveries and allows her personal preferences and biases to dominate the book. By the end, I was just plain bored."
1,Kindle Edition,"The Kindle edition is the same price as the print edition so Kindle readers save only the shipping charges.This is unfair! The production costs of electronic distribution are a fraction of paper and printing costs. If the publishers, authors, and especially Amazon don't understand this, they'll lose profits because people with any reasoning powers at all will not pay full price for an e-edition.I will not buy ANY EDITION of this book in protest of this unfair practice."
3,Interesting but a little skewed,"I thought this was a very interesting book, but I felt at times that I was getting more of the author's perspective on religious life than that of the nuns she interviewed. She seemed intent upon zeroing in on ""scandalous"" information, such as nuns' disdain for the male Catholic hierarchy, or the acceptance of lesbians into their orders. Also, her portrayal and understanding of feminism was very unscholarly and naive. At one point she writes, ""In my mind, these women [nuns] are living the ultimate feminist lives--almost totally devoid of men"" (xvi). She clearly has very old-fashioned ideas of what feminism is."
3,"Great mouse, long cord","Mouse is great. I was very surprised by the long cord that goes with the transmission receiver. Okay for desktop, not convenient for travel because of the cord."
4,A bargain,This is a great mouse if you buy it at the discounted price. The tilt wheel is fabulous. You don't have to worry about installing software because it is already installed in Win XP. I like that it is light and has extra buttons. Overall it is very good at least for me.
4,Locals Worship the Volumen!,"Unique and full of variation! The opening song, ""Super Confident Guy"" has a great groovy feel...actually it reminds me a bit of some of the music in the film Napoleon Dynamite. The you hit awesome tracks like ""Videogamin"" and ""Andaic"" are sweeeeet hyper-active, jamming songs. There are some beautiful melodies as well, as in ""Pretty Girls."" Most songs on the CD, however, are very humorous and will make you laugh. With the variety and the number of tracks on this CD, it is serious bang for your buck. I am lucky to live in the same town as these fun rockers! If you like alternative rock and have a sense of humor, you'll like this CD. Bonus: the Album Art is cool too."
4,"Ah, sweet relief","Overall, I am really happy with this exercise mat. I bought it for myself, but was pleasantly surprised to see it is long enough for my 6'2"" husband to use comfortably as well. It is softer than expected, but supportive enough that I don't feel like I'm sinking. It is easy to store and I love the handles on the side."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I bought one of these 6 or 7 years ago. My then-new little puppy tore up one panel on it, but I've been using it ever since anyway, turning the torn up (and I mean torn up) panel down.So I finally decided to get a new one. It appears the quality has suffered. Softer foam. Somewhat ill-constructed cover, crooked seams, loose material. Less mass. Not the quality of the first one. I'd have rather paid $20 more for high quality for a mat I hope to use for years. Oh well.Perhaps an Aeromat would have been a better choice."
1,Don't order,"What the product description doesn't say is that the mat contains chemicals known to the state of California as cancer causing. It just cost me $17 to mail it back. Don't buy this product, it is harmful, especially to kids. And cost me alot to mail it back."
5,mat,bought for my granddaughters they love it and use it every day. even my 14 year grandson use it topractice his weresling
4,Very nice mat,"I gotta say that I felt like I was rolling the dice on this, because I was not sure if it would be firm enough. It is soft, but also firm, but not as firm as the commercial type blue mats used for things like gymnastics. Really that is OK though since for a exercise and stretching mat it does not need to be that firm, and this mat is a good balance. I think the quality is OK and there was only the faintest of odor up close which is not a minus, just an observation. The size is also good, I doubt many people would need something bigger."
5,great work out mat,I love this mat!! My trainer had this same mat in her gym and I just had to have it. It's durable and extremely comfortable. I do my yoga on it as well as crunches and stretching. You can't miss with this mat.
5,Everlast excercise mat.,"Everlast 2'x6' Folding MatI purchased this mat because of the history I have had with Everlast products. I purchased it for home use for myself and my wife. It is the quality and functionality that I expected. I like the single fold on this mat in actual use compared to mats that fold two times. To store out of site, I slip it behind the dresser or sofa. Shipping was prompt and I am happy with the purchase."
3,Ok,This is a basic Gym mat. Its works well for doing sit up/floor excercises. We bought two for our sons to wrestle on and it hasn't worked well for that. As far as durbility goes one alreay has a rip in it.
5,Great for yoga,"I bought this mat because I have a thin area rug over my hardwood floor, and I wanted a thicker cushion for doing yoga. I bought one of these to put under my yoga mat, but it didn't give me quite enough area for some of the postures, so I bought another one and put them side-by-side with my yoga mat straddling them. It's not the perfect setup, but I've been using them this way for a year now with no sagging on the edges where they meet. I also really like having two folding mats because it makes them easy to store in my apartment."
2,Ok mat but NOT like the older version,"Not worth the price I paid. I purchased 2 of these mats in search of the Everlast mats that are like the ones in my gym. These look the same but they aren't solid like the old ones. They are better than some of the cheaper versions but again, NOT worth the price. If you expect to get a good sturdy mat like Everlast used to make, this mat is NOT it! I guess they just don't make them like the older version. The original Everlast mats weren't made of sponge. Don't know what they were made of but they're much better than these and yes, my ORIGINAL mats are still going strong. I'm not sure these will last very long at all.You can see in the picture how the vinyl looks wrinkled. That's because it is and it doesn't fit tight like the original. $[..] would have been worth the price for the original but not for this one, definitely not the $[..] they are asking now!"
5,Comfortable and soft,Great mat I use it for exercising on and for laying my baby down on (cleaned). It is soft but not too soft that you sink into it. It makes for a good workout. Just wish it was a bit wider which I am sure they have some that are. I just thought it may be a bit wider than it was. No I didn't really look at the dimensions so it's my fault. But this is a review of mostly praise anyway.
5,Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!,"In my quest for a mat that resembled the mats of yesteryear that many will remember being used in Gym class during the 60's and 70's,....I was about to give up hope. FINALLY,...I came across this one. It is designed for just one person,but that was all I needed for my situp mat. I wanted a heavy duty mat that had the padding I needed to cushion my backside during my exercises.THIS is it! It's firm, with just enough give,...and it has some weight to it!!!This mat is a GREAT deal!!!"
4,Easy on the back and feet!,The yoga mat I previously ordered and returned was nothing more than a non-skid backing for a kitchen rug. The Everlast mat is thick enough to do sit-ups ad jog on over a hardwood floor. The fold-in-half deign allows for easy storage.
4,Perfect for what I needed it for.,I wanted a mat specifically for P90X Ab Ripper X and a few moves thru out the other routines. For that purpose it works great and am very happy I purchased it!That said I really don't see much over all use for it... Its to soft to do Yoga or actual cardio on it...
4,Nice Mat!,"I purchased this mat for my daughter to use under her balance beam. I understand what others are saying that it could be a little bit firmer, but for the money, I don't think you can beat it!"
4,Growing on me,"At first I though it was too narrow. I thought it would be opening on the other side so that it would be all wide....but in fact it's really long and narrow. after my initial disappointment, caused by misunderstanding of dimensions, I've come to love the plush, firm mat that helps me do my sit ups"
4,It is a black mat,"It is black, provides cushion, and says Everlast on the side. Stitching seems strong and the material is durable. Only drawback is it can get a bit slick when wet."
4,XBR is good; HS is better,"Sony's XBR has long been their flagship. It has unparalleled quality, and a good price. It has lots of inputs, and decent built in speakers. But Sony released a comparable model in June 2000. It is the KP 61 HS-10. It is substantially clearer and has twice the scan rate. It is HDTV ready, and boasts more powerful speakers. And what's more, the retail price is far lower. I would look into both before buying, and actually go to a store and see them side by side before buying online."
1,not a clue....,I don't trust a thing T.D. Jakes says about investing after the past election cycle. He really doesn't have a clue...
3,Not Happy!!!,"The item received was NOT the item advertised. When I sent a request for the correct item, I received an email with NO explanation of what happened just that I would be receiving a refund. I know I shouldn't complain since I did get my money back, but I really wanted the correct book!!! The description & the picture shown was correct for the year of my car; however, the book received was NO where close & serves NO purpose!!!"
4,Good repair manual,Owned a Crown Victoria handed down from my grandfather. I passed the car on to my cousin before really needing the manual. 4 stars gives the book the benefit of the doubt as I know many people who have other manuals like this for other cars.
2,Sequel to Class Of 1999,"Good old Sasha Mitchell (best known for his role as Cody on TV's ""Step By Step"" as well as his role in the KICKBOXER movies) is a robot teacher gone haywire in the sequel to the 1989 cult favorite.As much of a fan as I am of Sasha and the original film, this one is pretty mediocre. Nick Cassavettes as a pretty boy teacher gets annoying pretty quick and the characters and story are not nearly as fun, the second time around.If you really loved the first film and you can find this one ..., go for it, otherwise, leave it alone."
3,Wonderful Film,"The film was pretty good. For any of you out there that have seen the first Class Of 1999, which is virtually impossible to find, you'd know that this movie is incomparable to the first one. But, the movie is still good. Anyone who has seen Class Of 1999 for sale, email me at international_pimp@iamwasted.com. Thanx to all."
1,"GOOD TV, HIGH PRICE","this high a price is not worth the TV. they just don't match. it is a good tv, the glare is minimized, the picture is clear, but it is the same as other TV's of this type, but for $250 more. Be a smart shopper and look around, like i should have"
2,Lots of issues,"The entire thing is very microsoft-centric. Much of the functionality is lost on a non-msft platform, or if you are not using all microsoft applications (email, media-player, messanger, etc).* Functions keys don't work normally. You have to press another special F-Lock key to get them to work. If you want to close a lot of windows, you can no longer hold the cntl key and hit F4-F4-F4. It's no longer that simple.* They did away with the insert key. You can no longer do the shift-del and shift-ins to cut-and-paste.* Eats up batteries, especially the mouse. Nothing will work correctly if the batteries get low. Once I had to pull the plug on my PC because the batteries got low, and I couldn't use my mouse or keyboard to shut it down.* You have to be very careful about where you place your mouse and keyboard, they have to be able to make radio contact.* It doesn't really eliminate any cables, because you have that ""pod"" thing."
2,could be better,"While I love the fact that there are no cables and the freedom that comes with it, I dislike how the mouse and keyboard will spontaneous stop working. Or how the power supply has to be connected to the port replicator before it will work, and won't work if you plug in the power after starting the laptop."
1,Sorry to say...,I am sorry to say that this product is sitting in my closet unused because I could never get both the keyboard and the mouse to work at the same time. I liked the keyboard when it was connected and working and I liked the mouse when it was hooked up and working but they never worked at the same time. I tried everything. I went on line with Microsoft but nothing worked.I connected it to a PC. Maybe it works better on a MAC.
3,over rated,"After reading the reviews on this CD i went out and bought it, and personaly,i was quite disappointed. the rhyming was weak and didnt keep my attention and the beats sound like stuff my friends and i used to make in my basement in 9th grade. Personally i hate to knock on underground artists cus i want them to get as much money as they can considering they arnt big stars, but this album was just a disappointment to me. if youre lookin for good underground/semi underground try Soulsides Greatest Bumps or Foreign Leigon, and i cant forget Mood andHi-Tek (from the 'Nati)."
1,Great! But don't try to create an MP3.,"Sumi Jo is extraordinary, - I won't repeat what others have effused here. However, I like to play my CDs on my computer while working. This CD is not playable on a computer.I suspect it must be some sort of copy protection - the playback is accompanied with massive static sounds (ERATO Disque SA). While it plays cleanly on my living room set, I cannot play it in the office, nor can I convert it to MP3 for my ipod. At first I thought it was somehow a flawed disk, so I exchanged it through Amazon, but the replacement is the same.It is completely legal to play YOUR OWN music on YOUR OWN computer, or to ""rip"" YOUR OWN music to MP3 for playing in YOUR OWN ipod. Amazon should make clear that these disks are quite limited in their application. I will return it also."
3,Gorgeous Voice,"Lets face it, Sumi Jo has a gorgeous voice, her technique is stupendious, and she pays close attention to EVERY detail. The main complaint I have about this CD is that: the songs are just not all that great (with the exception of the Korean song, its absolutely wonderful). Sure the songs are impossible to sing, but they are lacking beauty, which is one the main things we consider when we listen to a song. Right? Of course I must give Sumi credit for performing such a challening repertoire, but, for me, they are just not all that pleasing to listen to. They seem too heavy and eccentric for my taste. If you want to hear hear Sumi sing up a storm, by all means, buy this CD, but if you are more into the ""full experience"" check out ""Sumi Jo sings live at Carnegie Hall"" or the ""Bel Canto"" CD."
4,There's a better version for some of the pieces in this CD,"I think her diction is not clear enough for every Korean song she performs cuz lyrics in these Koreans songs (mostly poems) are really meant to be understood (for Korean speaking listeners). And I think her ""Candide"" song is better performed in her live CD "" Live at Carneigie Hall"". For ""Ariadne auf Naxos"", you must listen to the original version by Virgin Classics. It's superb!!. I'm fortunate to own that CD:)"
5,More than just a shallow coluratura,"Although I love the music of the coluratura soprano one finds too often that the singers, though flexible and wide in range, do not have emotional or tonal depth. Sumi Jo proves an exception. She has one of the most delightful voices on record and produces some stupendous sounds in the heights of her range. One might mistake her for a wind instruments at times!I disagree with a previous reviewer who argued that the songs are less than satisfying. Here we see one of the most beautiful selections of music available. Although it is true that some are not so well executed as that giant of coluratura (and any other genre) soprano-singing the great Joan Sutherland or as effortless in the heights there is a fine selection. Sumi Jo is of a different ilk to Sutherland and makes a masterpiece of 'Der Hoelle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen.'"
2,Keeps you guessing? Not in my opinion.,"This book was utterly predictable. I had figured out who the killer was a quarter into the book, and believe me, I'm no mystery aficionado. It's not that it wasn't entertaining-- I finished it in about three days-- it's just that I was too prepared for the ending."
5,A good mystery,"This was the first time, I read anything by this author and it won't be the last. This story is about a death that happened 110 years ago and the modern day disappearance of some other girls in a small town. An ancestor of the missing woman of 110 years ago goes back to her hometown and purchases the house own by her Aunt. There are many suspects in this story but there is a surprise ending. I enjoyed this story."
4,Suspense Truely Hits Home,"Mary Higgins Clark has written many suspense novels and this one stands with her best. She constructs the plot very well. If you've liked her books in the past, On The Street Where You Live, is definitely for you.The novel is set in Spring Lake, New Jersey; a quite little seaside town. Emily Graham has just bought an old victorian home which once was owned by her family. Only to discover that the body of a missing girl has been found in her backyard along with the body of Emily's missing relative, Madeline Shapley. Emily is determined to find out who is at the bottom of these murders; even if it means risking her own life. The plot unfolds in a furver of murders and twists and the conclusion will shock you. If you are a fan of suspense novels I suggest you buy this book."
2,Not typical of Mary Higgens Clark,"Too many characters, not enough depth of each one--even with the main character, Emily. I found it to be more of an advertisement for the wonders of Spring Lake [where MHC now has another home]. I agree, Spring Lake is truly beautiful, but there was too much description of the town, and not enough about the characters' feelings or thoughts. I like MHC other books, but this one left me bored."
5,Higgins-Clark at her best!! A true page-turner!!!,"I found this book to be a true pleasure. For a while I was finding Clark to be somewhat ""formulaic"" but she completely turns it around in this thriller...true ""beach reading"" at it's best. Character development &, more importantly, locality description is beautiful. Anyone who has ever been to Spring Lake,NJ (I have!) can almost follow where she's taking you. Right down to the gorgeous multi-million dollar victorian estates sprinkled through this town. Every chapter leaves you thinking, ""I know who did it!!"" and then the next chapter you're saying, ""Well, maybe it's this guy!!"". Needless to say,you can't put the book down!! It's not who you think it is..by a long shot!! And the conclusion will have you reeling!! I recommend it, HANDS DOWN!!"
3,nothing spectacular,"This is the first Mary Higgins Clark novel I've ever read. I picked this one because I'm a genealogist and this book has a family history element to it. I found this book to be well written and interesting overall but the ending left me flat. It's not that I was able to guess who the murderer was before Higgins revealed it, I didn't and that is a good thing, but that her revelation of who the murderer is has no excitement to it at all. Basically it is a totally zingless, boring ending and it left a sour taste in my mouth for the entire book."
2,Book good shape shipping high,"The book came in 100% perfect condition. I received it on time, but the shipping charge was move than the book cost and I could have ended up buying locally at a cheaper price"
2,disappointing,I have read all of her books and this one is certainly not good. Her plot seems to fall into a pattern. I know who did it before the first 100 pages!
3,Decent,"The book was written well, and kept me reading. The only thing that bothered me was how it wasn't as suspenseful as the others. I figured out the murderer quickly, and was quite disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big MHC fan, but this book just is not up to her usual standards. There are too many extraneous characters (way too many red herrings), and the main character was poorly developed and flat. There were also many loose ends, most glaring of which was the ""techie stalker."" And the reincarnation theme muddied the plot badly rather than add to it...and the ending was just lame, lame, lame. Come on Mary, drop the supernatural stuff, it just doesn't work for you."
2,Too many characters!,"This is terrible reviewing a book before actually finishing it but I can't seem to stay focused! I've read many of her books and this one has way too many characters to keep track of. I've read 3/4 of it and finally it was just like ""I'm giving up!"" Nothing outwardly exciting is happening, it's like this story is going in circles.I've read some of the other reviews and I seem to be a minority with my opinion. Anyway, this is what I think...maybe I didn't give it a chance??"
2,I was grateful when it ended,This is the first time I have read a book by Mary Higgins Clark. I think it will be my last. I found the book about as interesting as going to the dentist. This biggest flaw I found with the book is that none of the charactors seem to have any depth or personality. They are completly forgettable. The story itself was built on an interesting premise but it goes nowhere. Never have I felt such apathy for a novels cast of charactors. Even the ending is not all that big of a surprise. If you are currently reading this you have my sympathy.
3,Not up to her usual standards.....=(,"I'm a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark and anxiously looked forward to her newest story, On the Street Where You Live. It has an interesting setting and premise but it was too predictable. There was no chemistry between Emily Grahm and Nick Todd. Also, one can easily guess who the killer is and who the stalker is.I will admit that I found the stalker's little jokes absolutely terrifying and I was fascinated with the theories of reincarnation but, on the whole, I think Mrs. Clark could have done more with this novel."
2,Disappointing,"This was the first Mary Higgins Clark book I have read and I certainly hope her previous novels were better. The story is slow in development and the ""Who dunnit"" is conveyed in one simple sentence at the beginning. I only read the rest of it to find out the connection between the person I suspected and the historical relation. Even more disappointing was some loose ends that had no follow-up. Perhaps this is the basis for her next book? I certainly hope not! But I must give Ms. Clark the benefit of the doubt and read some of her earlier work."
1,There is no whodunit factor in this book (or any of MHC's books),"There is no ""whodunit"" factor in this, or any other, MHC novel. Every single novel of hers has the SAME villain. Every time, we have to choose between: Highly Suspicious Guy #1, Highly Suspicious Guy(s) #2-whatever, and Random Nice Guy With No Apparent Motive. In each and every MHC novel I've read, the murderer is ALWAYS the Random Nice Guy With No Apparent Motive. This book is no exception. I picked out the murderer within the first 20 pages of this book. I'm not quite sure why I read this book to the end; I guess I was curious if MHC always followed her formula. The answer is -- yes, she sure does! I guess I was hoping this one would somehow end differently. Surely I can't be the only person who has noticed this?"
1,On the street where you live,"I have enjoyed Ms Higgins Clark's early books immensely. They seem well researched and take the reader into a number of different worlds eg hospital, health spa, politics etc. It's disappointing to read her later novels which are very superficial by comparison. This one, in particular, is filled with numerous characters and suspicions and counter-suspicions, but no real depth to the people portrayed. Unfortunately this produced a very unsatisfying read."
3,Suspense filled. A good attempt at a tired subject.,"The bad of the book involves the very tired serial killer subject that is being done to death by every suspence writer. However, the story has great suspense and will really keep you guessing. The serial killer returning from the past also adds an interesting dynamic. The story is well structured and I found the plot moved very well and should keep the interest of any reader. The characters in the book are kind of thrown at you to create confusion and more attention could have been payed to fleshing out the characters. Most seem rather wooden and unimportant to the story. Not a perfect book, but as good as anything Clark has written in recent years."
3,not very substantial,"The characters in this book are so two-dimensional that I could not care about them. I was not even interested in the killer. I knew the main character was going to escape being murdered with only a second or two to spare, I knew the killer was going to try to strangle her with a scarf, but I really didn't care. Reincarnation and hypnotic regression were part of the story, but there was so little depth or detail, it was just not interesting. There are so many thrillers available, and while many of them aren't great, usually they are at least interesting, that it seems like a waste of time to read this one."
3,So-So,"One thing about MHC's books, they keep you drawn in so it's difficult to put the book down. This was an OK book. To me, Clark is not in the same league as Connelly, Lehane or McGarrity. However, I enjoy her plots and I like her choice of setting. They make me want to visit the coast of New Jersey.This particular book was about Emily, a defense lawyer who buys a victorian style house which is in the middle of a history of murder. Plus, she has a stalker still after her even though she thought he was put away in a mental institution.This book can be confusing if you don't stay on top of the characters and who is doing what. That to me, is her downfall. Too many characters and too much going on at the same time.All in all, this book is enjoyable, it's just not one of my favorites."
3,Not very impressive,"I was quite disappointed with this latest book by Clark. Perhaps I've outgrown Mary Higgins Clark - who knows. The book plot was certainly original but the book moved much too slowly.Instead of her usual batttery of suspects, there were only 3 suspects and only 2 of them were suscpicious which meant that the least suspicious character did the murders, naturally.Next time, I won't buy her books brand new - I'll wait and get them for trade in a used book store so if they disappoint me I won't be losing money."
4,Mary Higgins Clark...does it once again,"i have been reading mary higgins clark since i was in the 6th grade, (i am now going to be a sophmore in high school). I absolutely love reading her books, i can never put them down. She always has the way of leaving you little clues but yet you are always surprised at the ending she unfolds. All of the books i have read of hers are absolutley page turning. Once you start you can't stop. Mary has a magical way of pulling you into the book and blocking out everything else, getting you anxious, nervous and making it feel almost as if you are there. i recommend any of Marys books, even though i haven't read them all, because i know she is just so good they are going to be too. if you love mysteries, and thrillers, you will love her books....enjoy"
5,Past Meets the Present,"After all these years, Mary Higgins Clark is still at the top of her game. I enjoyed this story even though I figured out whodunit early in the game. Emily Graham purchases a home where an actual ancestor disappeared many years ago without a trace. Bodies of women are turning up (some who've been dead for many years and other more recent). The media is calling it a reincarnated serial murder but how are today's crime connected with yesterday's disappearances? Finding out whodunit takes us through many twists and turns but I must say I was very fond of this novel and I think you will be too. Keep up the good work Ms. Higgins Clark."
5,There she goes again.....,"I was so excited to find that Mary Higgins Clark had written another novel. I bought the book the day it came out and couldn't put it down. Like all her other novels, the ending is full of suprises. She keeps you guessing since this novel definitly has many people you can count as suspects. Clark's books always use well thought out plots. She researches all the material for her book which adds to the reality of what's happening to her characters. I'm so amazed at how well she writes. I've read all her books and can't wait for more to come. This is definitly a book you should read."
2,Disappointment with my favorite author's latest,"I can't usually wait until Mary's newest book arrives, so with great expectation I dove into this one. At first it was as I expected, and I was enjoying the storyline, but then there seemsed to be new characters in almost every chapture. I became less & less involved, interested, in trying to keep up with who was who and he/she went, came here or was going there. It was confusing and not her usual writing 'greatness' in my opinion. I wish she would get back to more mystery/love storylines like the 'old' days. Books I really enjoyed were:'Where Are The Children', etc. I have read and own every one of her books, so I am a great fan of yours Mary! I know it's in you... please give it to us. Your faithful readers & friends!"
3,Reliable Read,"There comes a time when I like to read a book that I KNOW will be worth my time and that is why I read On The Street Where You Live. I've read her work before and consider her a reliable read (author). Clark's words flow easily and the story never stalls. I hung in until the end to find out 'who done it'.Three stars to me is a good read. (I don't give 5 stars away easily) If you like Clark, you will like this book."
3,One does keep reading,"This 2001 novel is the author's 20th but the first one by her I have ever read. The central character is a woman lawyer who has had much success as a criminal defense lawyer. She moves to New Jersey and immediately is involved with a series of murders, apparently copying a series of murders which happened in the 1890's. It is all pretty fantastic and unlikely but things keep happening and one is happy to keep reading to see who the murderer is. And the characters are not prone to objectionable language. But it is not great writing nor a very subtle plot. I don't regret reading the book but whether I will ever read another of the author's books I doubt."
4,Another good one!,"I've enjoyed reading Mary Higgins Clark mysteries for years, and this one was no exception. I would recommend it for any fan of hers. Thanks."
3,Solid Mystery,Good solid suspense thriller with a strong female character. Relationships unravel as the body count mounts. Will the heroine get every last detail out of the killer before she becomes the next victim. Have to buy the book to find out.R HemingwayPast Twilight
1,Boring!!!,"After reading the first few chapters, I couldn't continue. The writing seemed so amateurish. The story just seemed like it wasn't going to take you anywhere and it held no interest. I was going to continue reading but thought it would be in my best interest to put it down. It seems MHC is at the end of her writing career. Her writing just doesn't draw me in anymore. And for years she was one of my favorite authors. I've never given a novel this unfavorable of a review, and hope to never do this again."
2,Is It Really That Bad??,"I am a huge Mary Higgins Clark fan, but I really think she's started slipping. After reading several reviews for this book, I decided to go ahead and buy it. Although there were mixed reactions to this book, I thought I'd but it anyway. I'd always liked her books before and was sure I'd like this one too. Not true! There were far too many characters with very little depth to them. The main character, Emily, lacked personality as well. When I finally got to the end, I wasn't all that surprised as to who the killer was. This book lacks a good plot and has little imagination. A Word of advice--- Believe me! You CAN wait until it comes out in paperback! It might be a little better if you don't have to spend so much to get it!"
4,Excellent Read!,"I breezed through this latest installment of mystery stories by Mary Higgins Clark. Through numerous twists and turns, the reader is kept guessing about the identity of both the stalker and the murderer. Read this on a relaxing summer day down at the shore and soak up this historical thriller."
1,Very disappointed!,"I wish I had waited for the library to get this book. There are so many characters in this book it is hard to figure out what purpose they have in the story. And also, I didn't find any of them interesting, even the main character. The plot is boring, the characters are dull, don't waste any money on this book."
2,thin and predictable,"I read this book because of a review. I was very disappointed. The characters are very one-dimensional; it was almost impossible to tell them apart. Even the heroine had no real personality but was just a vehicle around which the plot revolved. The plot itself held no surprises: the murderer could have been anybody, there was no real thread to discovery and understanding. It was more like a one hour tv show than a book."
1,This One Does It For Me,"Right after it was first published, I read MHC's ""The Cradle Will Fall"". Then I read ""Where are the Children"". I enjoyed them so much, I kept reading her song title stories. They have become less and less interesting, engrossing and competently written. This one is the worst. It is trite, full of snobbish allusions, and poorly plotted. She had so many people being killed, it was difficult to keep track of them all. It's true that I didn't know who had killed everyone until the end, but by then I simply didn't care. I will never read another one."
2,What a let down!,"This was by far the worst book by Mary Higgins Clark and I'm usually a fan of her work. There were way too many characters and they weren't developed enough so you couldn't keep straight who was who and what they had to do with the story. The ending was just plain stupid! The story ended with some of the most important characters on the verge of something important and poof that's that you don't know what happened to them. I closed this book feeling frustrated, disappointed and confused. So confused in fact that I went back and read the last chapter thinking maybe I missed something.....I didn't but I think the author did!"
2,On The Street Where You Live,"Mary Higgins Clark writes an okay story around a really excellent plot. She works too hard at making you wonder who the villan is, and all her work was for naught, because I had it figured out by the 4th chapter. Had she just written more in depth caracters, the story would have been more intense, and therefore more enjoyable to read."
3,It had its good points; it had its bad points,"Pluses were a fascinating premise and the introduction of several characters who could have been the guilty party for a real whodunit for the reader. Minuses were that I really didn't feel I knew the main character very well; I knew more about two of the possible suspects than I did about her. It's been years since I've read anything by Mary Higgins Clark and while I did enjoy it and kept saying ""one more chapter"" I felt it could have been better written with more depth to Emily."
5,MARY HIGGANS CLARK HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!,I started reading this book when I bought it and finished it that day. Its one of my favorite books i have ever read. She is one of the best authors in the world and maybe is. I HIGHLY suggest any who loves mysteries / loves mary higgans clark read this book.
4,Where's the Link With The Murders Past and Present?,"This book was interesting and it kept you in suspense all the way through it.Following the acrimonious breakup of her marriage and the searing experience of being pursued by a stalker, criminal defense attorney Emily Graham accepts an offer to work elsewhere in a major Manhattan law firm.Feeling her need for roots, she buys her family's ancestral home, a restored Victorian house in the historic New Jersey seaside resort town of Spring Lake. Her family had sold this house is 1892, after one of Emily's forebears, Madeline Shapely, then still a young girl vanished.Now, more than a century later, as as the house is being renovated and the back yard excavated for a pool, the skeleton of a young woman is found. From there is a mystery that continues to unwind, and gets scarier with each page turn."
3,Not one of her best.,"I have read many of MHC's novels. This one I must say was sort of a let down. The story involved too many characters, making it hard to follow and easy to forget who all of them were. I didn't think that the ending was all that great, either. Sorry, but this one was just ""alright""."
3,Good But Not Great,"I'm a big fan and always waiting for MHC's new book to come out. When this one came out I couldn't wait to read it. The story sort of held my interest, but the ending was non-climatic. There were lots of characters but they weren't fully developed and I was left wondering what happened to them. I was very disappointed with the ending and I think when the next book comes out I will probably wait for it in paperback."
5,Loved it!,"I love Mary Higgins Clark, and this book just added to her greatness! :) Can't wait to start the next book."
4,suspense suspense suspense,This one had my mind going in all diffrent directions. Just when you think you know who was the murderer.... your wronge..
5,This would make a great movie!,"Lawyer Emily Graham has just moved into her ancestral home in a picturesque seaside village when a series of murders begins. And not just any murders: They replicate to the last detail a series of murders that took place there one hundred years ago, and the anniversary of the last killing is this Saturday...who will be next?Mary Higgins Clark has created a strong heroine in Emily and filled the story with a large cast of suspects that will keep you guessing until the last minute. My favorite chapters were those narrated by the unseen killer, who may be just demented or may be the reincarnation of the original killer.The frequent comparisons between town life in the Victorian era and the present make me think this would make a lovely and suspenseful film. And the big question (has the original killer been reincarnated?) makes for fun, if creepy, speculation. Heartily recommended."
3,Better than average,"This book has so much to recommend it. It's got pacing, a stunning plot, and it's decently crafted. The writing itself, though lackluster in style, was clear. However, the characters are so pat and there is absolutely no humor here which might have added comic relief as well as more dimension to the tone. There are also too many characters, and an ending that barely ties up the loose ends. I also figured out the killer much too quickly, which may be because I'm also a novelist.This was my first try at a MHC book, and on the positive side, I will try another example of her writing to give her a second chance."
2,Should be tailed to martial arts!,"While I am confident that the author understands and is fully qualified to discuss traditional weight training techniques, I would have expected a sports-specific practitioner to have been consulted on the specific exercises and techniques necessary for that sport. In martial arts, stretching and warm-up is very important and I would have expected the stretching and warm-up section to be much larger than it is. The exercises should also be specifically chosen to best complement your sport. This does not appear to be the case here.I would buy a book (or multiple books) specific to your style of martial art. In my case (Karate), I am using ""The Art of Hojo Undo"" for training and an older introduction book by Shingo Ohgami for warm-up (but any comprehensive book covering your specific martial art will provide the proper stretching and warm-up exercises necessary).Keep looking."
3,The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Martial Arts,It is an interesting fast view of weight training for martial arts
3,Good mouse but still needs work.,"Pros: Great build quality. The wireless aspect of the mouse works well and tracks well with almost no noticeable delay. The mouse is very comfortable and feels good in hand.Cons: Doesn't side scroll in Visio for enterprise architects as well as other programs. Do research is you want to use this mouse for specific programs. Does not have a true smooth scroll like advertised. It just feels like smooth scrolling but still notches down and up in the window. The side scrolling works but has different speeds in different applications. Ex. It is slow in VS.NET and fast in IE. Pretty nerve wracking. You must have ""Terminal Services"" turned on or the drivers will not work. I'm sure this is an early bug and will corrected shortly.Overall: I am happy with this mouse. I use it for development purposes and it work quite nicely I must say."
1,Not Happening Birthday Present,"I am unable to review this iem as we have not received it yet. It was supposed to be a birthday present for 9/17, but I have been advised it will not be shipped until the middle of October or so.Chris Murphy"
1,Not Released item,How can a review be made on an item that is not even relesed today is 11/11/05 and this is the second toime I write this....The Doll White Chocolate Obsession Barbie is not online for order or pre order as yet....and at the same time while no one owns this doll yet there is a review...How is that ?
3,Shame on the Reviewers,"I'm contemplating buying this doll and have read all the reviews. From the people that have actually spent the money and bought her they have been thrilled with her. I am appauled by the people complaining about the price and whinging that they don't have the money. It's a Limited Edition with only around 1000 made - of course it's going to be expensive. If you don't have the money don't buy the doll, find one within your budget there are plenty to choose from. Don't ruin the experience for the people that have her or want her by complaining."
3,White Chocolate Obsession overpriced,"This is a beautiful doll, but not worth the $249 asking price. This is Chocolate, Citrus and Peppermint Obsession in a different ""flavor"". I would not pay more than $39.99 for her. I didn't ""take advantage"" of buying other dolls from a small list that I already had or didn't want, to get this doll at a cheaper price. This is a total rip-off price. Looks like others feel the same. Hmmmmmmm!!!"
2,Pretty doll- pretty lame promo,"It's not just the price, it's the principal. However - platinum or not, $250 bucks for a vinyl doll is really outrageous. If you are a Barbie collector you know that platinum dolls are usually under $200, more like $180 and less. But, it's the promotion itself that really sticks in my craw.To have to spend $100, on top of the $35, and only have a very small number of overstocked dolls (that have all been available for months now) to choose from is really pathetic.If people don't pay the inflated price, or buy into such a lame offer, maybe TRU will think twice about similar promos in the future."
1,White Chocolate Barbie,Even FAO Schwarz doesn't charge this much for thier exclusives and thiers are even more limited. ....I'd have to say that this is a very unreasonable Price...the doll is not all that. Will have to wait for the 90% off sale.This doll shouldn't be more than 59.99.
1,Bad Promo!,"I was very excited about the promotion when I read about it but I have already bought the doll I would have chosen from that LIMITED selection and don't want the others. There are several collector dolls I had been interested in and thought I might purchase to qualify. No way now, I'm not falling for a cheap marketing gimick to rid themselves of last year's dolls without a clearance sale."
3,Give me a break!!!! This is a ridiculous price for this doll!!,Can you spell S-C-A-L-P-E-R????This doll isn't worth more than $35. Great marketing--a nice way to sell another $100 worth of dolls to get her at that price. Anyone who would pay full retail is a fool! (And Mattel and TRU need to realize we collectors are NOT fools!)Shaking my head on this one. Arghhhhhh!
1,How is it????,How is it that you can charge 130.00 for a doll that was limited to 500...and can charge 250.00 for a doll that is limited to 1000???
1,lol,"Years ago when i saw the bob machie's bride barbie, i thought she was the most beautiful barbie mattel could ever create and to this day i have none to her equal. i paid $130.00 on sale for her and have never had a regret. To see a doll of this quality for that much money is a SIN or usury. Shame Shame. I will never buy this barbie because to have her in my collection would mean i would have to lower intergity. toy r us, you insult your customers by this deal and i will have no part in your sales as you take advantage of my fellow barbie collectors."
4,Glad I waited!,I've been a collector for 12 years now and I an constantly checking barbiecollector.com and toysrus.com for deals. I've been drooling over the DOTW princesses for the past few months (I'm a poor college student) and when I saw this deal I knew it was worth the wait! This is a great deal!
1,If there was a ZERO star I would have picked that,"You know, I really contemplated getting this Barbie but then had a revelation - this doll is ""marked"" for price of $249.99 but I could buy her for $34.99 if I buy $100.00 of a select group of Collector Barbies that I don't want to buy or already own?!?!?!?! You know, I love the doll but I am not paying either price and I will forgo having her. I have better things to waste my money on.....sorry Toys R' Us & Amazon, no sale this time :-("
1,White Cholocate Barbie Priced to high,"I can't understand why Toy's R us would price this barbie dollso high, I have the Cholocate Barbie from last, and there isonly two differences there nothing special about this one.Even if its a Platium its not worth $240.00.They even know its to high thats why your able,to purchase itfor $39.99 ,if you spend $100.00 on the barbies they want toget rid of. I think no one should purchase this one to letthe company know where not going to stand for this. If therestuck with them that would be a good lesson for them."
1,O U T R A G E O U S,"This doll IS attractive, HOWEVER, her price is unheardof for a VINYL Barbie. I mean, c'mon... in my opinion, if it's over $160, I don't think it's worth acquiring. Especially when there are other platinum labels she [White Chocolate] has to compete with. This Platinum version Barbie is well worth living without."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"My mother was half way through a scarf she was knitting and need this yarn to finish. She scoured the city to no avail and also the internet except for Amazon.She did find on location but the expense was unreal and the shipping of 4 small balls of yard was well over $30.When I mention Amazon she was amazed the yarn & shipping were so reasonably priced.CV Retail, LLC exceeded their promised ship date by several days. I think they arrived within 2 days of ordering."
1,Chocolate Fun Fur,"I apologize for not rating this item very highly. I gathered the yarn for a weekend trip away where I was going to start my project. I made one stop at a retail store and the entire lot of chocolate fun fur I had you ship to me, the crochet hook and 2 Leisure Arts instruction books I was going to use for the project, was stolen from my car. Other items were taken, like my camera, my purse and everything I was taking for the weekend, but I was most upset about the yarn and instruction books.I haven't had the energy to order it all again. I tried to purchase the exact fun fur from yarn stores with coupons, but I couldn't find 8 matching dye lots.So I have no experience with this product.Signed, Discouraged in Aptos."
4,Jesuit History,"This book is well written and informative. The information is relevant and informative even though it was written 100 years ago. This should be required reading for anyone who wants to know what is behind the scenes in world history. ""Secret Terrorists"" by Bill Hughes gives the rest of the story up to the present.The Secret TerroristsWant to know what's really going on?"
4,Cool Deal,"I got this just to shoot hockey balls at in the backyard. Wanted one for quite a while, and didn't know they were this affordable. Fairly easy to put together. Sturdy enough.Two minor complaints:1) Some of the fittings are not snug / tight, meaning that the goal comes easily apart when you don't want it to (puck / ball hits it, you move it). I ended up using pvc glue in a couple connections. Now it stays together, and this was an easy solution, however, it won't be able to be taken apart or folded up, which is fine for me.2) Net could fit a bit snugger.Overall, good quality, sturdy (with some connections glued together), light and small enough to be stored. Plus, not expensive.This was a good purchase I am happy with."
4,Good products,"My kids love the two goals we have for soccer in the back yard. The construction is solid, and easy to put together. We've had it out in sun and rain for over a year (the first one we bought) and it hasn't suffered noticeably."
2,"After 3 month used, it shattered.","First, I have to say that it is convinient and easy to carry in and out of garage. However don't be fooled by the word ""high impact pvc"", it shattered after three month usage. Better to put the money to buy the steel one."
2,Not durable,This net is made of thin PVC. The side post shattered with the first hard shot. It is not durable. Such a disappointment for my three children the day after they received this product for Christmas.
5,bought as a gift for grand daughter,"I bought this game as a gift for my grand daughter for her Birthday in Dec. She hasn't gotten it yet,, but her cousins have this game and she loved playing theirs,, so asked her Nana to please find it cause this would be a really cool game I can play til you get home and take me to ""Build a Bear workshop"" Being the Nana I am,,, she gets her game.thank you so much,Nana --Tammy Davis"
2,A bit disappointed,My six yr old doesn't play this game as much after the initial building of the 3 bears. Says she can't build anymore and it's not as much fun. I haven't looked at it to see if there are ways to build more or not. It was fun in the beginning.
3,loves the game,Bought for my 5 yr grand daughter and this is a very easy game. She sometimes gets bored with it. But my 2 yr old grand son is not interested in this game.
1,Boring....,"My kids (5 and 8) are big fans of Build-a-Bear Workshop and also the website, and they love the DS, but both decried the game as boring. I guess the two concepts don't mix well."
1,doesn't work with my DS,I was so disappointed that this game wouldn't work. My 7 year old daughter was so excited for it but we have had the same problem as others. As soon as we rub the hearts and whisper a secret into the mic - nothing happens. We tried clicking every button and talking for several minutes into the mic to try to figure out how to make it move to the next section but it never would. We exchanged it for the same game to see if another disk would work but it did the same thing. I don't know if it's just our DS or what but since others have stated the same problem then there must be a problem with the game. We have never had any problems with any of the other games that we have.
3,Fun but a little boring after a while,"I recently purchased this game because my daughter (just turned 6)isn't really the type that will sit and try to figure things out and the reviews said it was easy to play. I guess I underestimated her, because she was bored with it after 2 days.She says, ""It's fun but too easy. The picture taking part is fun, but the cooking part gets frustrating. It makes you stir the food too long, and it's the same 3 meals every time.""We're new to the whole video game thing, so I hope this is helpful!"
5,build a bear for grand-daughter,This was my grand-daughter's choice for a birthday present. It has kept her interest longer than most games & she seems to not tire of this. Good choice--highly recommend
5,My 4-Year Old Loves It,"My 4-year old daughter really loved getting this game for Christmas. She did have a little bit of trouble at first with figuring some of the gameplay out, but that didn't stop her from playing it over and over again. It's a great game to pick-up for the younger set."
5,5 year old daughter loves it,"I bought this after buying some other games for my daughter that she found frustrating due to the amount of reading involved or difficulty level. This is an easy game, simple for her to use on her own, and she absolutely loves it. Finding good games for a 5 year old girl is challenging, but this one hits the mark. I highly recommend this for anyone trying to find a cute, fun, easy and entertaining game for their young children. I would say this game is perfect for 4-7 year olds."
5,Hours of Fun!!!,I have a 6yr old little girl and she just can't get enough of this game. Very easy yet entertaining for the older kids. Looks geared more towards the girls but has bears for the boys and many features if you have more than one DS. Very worth the full price and a major deal if you get it on sale because it was well worth it. My daughter's favorite parts are being able to cook for her bear (a little like cooking mama) she likes to bathe him and put his clothes on and you can even swing him on the swings. I'm an adult and she's had me play and the only thing I found is it can be a bit monotonous which is why I recommend this from age 3 to 8.
3,"great game for younger kids, but reading is involved","This game is kind of like Webkinz in a sense. The kids can pick which animal they want to build and can choose various rooms to go in for games or cooking, bathing, getting dressed, dancing, etc. However, there is a lot of reading that explains what the child needs to do. It'd be better if it just talked the instructions instead. As long as your child can read really well or an adult is with them to read teh instructions to them it's a good game. I'm sure once they've played it many times, they figure out what to do and don't need the directions."
5,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!,"Build-a-bear workshop for ds is the awsomest game ever. It rocks! First, you get to choose an animal, then you stuff it, give it lots of love, stitch it, clothe it, and name it. Then you can take it home and feed it, play with it, go to the park, buy clothes, send it to bed, you name it.The graphics are adorable! I can not name one flaw that this game has. You can go to a photo studio and take pictures of you bear doing tricks. I reccomend this game for ages 3-11. Me and my friend are always taking turn with this, and we have a blast. Even though this is my game, I let her create her own bear. {written by my 9 year old daughter}"
3,Didn't click w/ 5 year old,This game has been a bit slow/tough for my 5 year old to get into. Maybe if we spend more time helping her get into it she will enjoy it but not so much at this point.She much prefers Mario Brothers or Mario Kart.
5,Some new old ideas,"I am a big fan of early American music, and Joel Cohen and the Boston Camerata really know how to do it. I found this album musically refreshing as well as spiritually refreshing. As a minister of music, I appreciate the sensitivity the Camerata brings to its interpretation of these traditional Shaker hymns. I also love hearing music by singers (specifially the Shakers themselves) who are not afraid to limit their understanding of who God is -- infinite and varied in nature, not subject to human limitations such as gender. There is a great freedom in this music which some listeners who are tired of the rigid confines of modern theology will appreciate. My only ambivalence is with the pieces on which the Shaker community takes a leading role. On the one hand, I think this is brilliant and enriching. On a purely auditory level, though, their untrained sound is a little distracting. Decide for yourself when you purchase this delightful album!"
4,"Head Exploding, Bloody Fun!","1. Pure bloody fun? Check!2. Insanely over the top fight scenes? Check!3. Kenshiro exploding heads and laying the beat down on the bad guys? Check!This is the basic premise to make a Hokuto no Ken novel work. All of these elements are here in all of it's gruesomely over the top nature. My only complaint, while not a very big one, is that this novel (and series of novels) would be great in full color instead of black and white.Either way, if you're a fan of the Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star universe, you should definitely get a kick out of this!"
4,"Works OK, instructions not accurate","We have a Palram greenhouse which this arm is supposed to fit. It does sort of fit, but the screws and attaching hardware shown on the instruction sheet did not match what actually came in the box with the arm (the arm appeared the same though). So I drilled a couple extra holes and cobbled it onto the greenhouse with only one additional trip to the hardware store for longer screws than were provided.The arm DOES work as it is supposed to, opening when it gets hot and closing in cooler temps. I'm not sure what the actual temp range is but it works effectively on our greenhouse. You can't really see it opening but it does open fairly quickly once the temp gets too hot.Overall, I'd buy it again but wish they'd pack the right hardware for the different greenhouses it is supposed to fit."
2,What's in the book is common sense,"I mistakenly bought this book when I meant to buy Toddler Play, however, after reading it I realized I probably don't need Toddler Play! The things suggested in this book are things I had done with my baby when he was a 'baby', without anyone telling me to do them. Chances are, ALL parents who have a baby are already doing what's suggested in this book too!"
3,Pretty book but...,"Beautiful book, would make a nice gift. However, chances are if you have a kid, you're already doing a lot of this stuff."
4,Good book for new moms,I find this book useful. I will be able to utilize the information over the next year with my infant. The item arrived in perfect condition and as described.
2,You don't need a book to tell you this stuff,"The book is colorful, has nice pictures and descriptions, but most of the activities in this book are things you would probably do with your child anyway. You're better off spending the money on a CD or toy, or admission to the zoo."
2,"if you have any parental intuition, you're doing fine and don't need this book.","i found the activities in this book uninspiring. i was already implementing 99% of them just in my everyday interactions with my infant. i was hoping for something that would further enhance the development of my child, but it turns out the things that naturally occur to a parent are just fine. my baby is only 3 months, so perhaps the activites for older babies will be more interesting. the play for newborns was a disappointment."
3,Not Needed For Parents Who Already Interact with Their Baby,"I bought this book as I am a new mother and I wanted to make sure I was doing everything can to entertain my baby and help her grow into an intelligent child. Once I received this book, I went through it and I already do these things with my baby. So for me, this was a waste of money. I am an involved parent. Everyday I talk to my baby, play with her, tell her what I am doing, ask her what she is trying to say to me and other things mentioned in this book. The key is to communicate with your baby, read books to your baby and give your baby lots of faces and pictures to look at. In my opinion this book is for parents who know nothing about babies."
2,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this book hoping it would have good ideas on things to do with my 9-month-old. However, it really adds nothing new at all. Most of the so-called ""age-appropriate activities"" are common-sense things I do with my baby anyway. For example, the first activity for a newborn is ""rock and sing your baby a lullaby"". Well, duh! How many of us need a book to tell us THAT? For older babies, suggestions include playing ball or peek-a-boo (gee, now isn't that original!), purchasing a stacking toy, rolling a ball, or reading a book. Virtually all of these suggestions can be found in any general book about babies, e.g., Dr. Sears' Baby Book.This book also contains lyrics to several children's songs but does not contain the melody - so they're worthless if you don't already know the song. You're much better off purchasing a book-CD set instead, e.g., ""Wee Sing for Baby"" is AWESOME!Skip this one- save your money and spend it on a good children's book or CD instead."
3,Great for moms new to the game,"If you are someone who has not worked with children or been around children for an extended period of time this book would be very helpful. It has creative and fun ideas for playtime with the ones under 6 months that my husband found very useful. I recommend it for husbands, grandparents and new moms."
3,Tried and True!,There is nothing fancy about the games for babies in this book. That is what I really like about it! Sometimes they seem a little obvious but overall it is a nice book to have around when trying to entertain your baby!
3,Good but sloppy.,The book is repetitive. Nonetheless I found the book helpful and I still use the soothing techniques suggested. I do like the fact that the book emphasized the need to console the baby BEFORE he/she is in a full lather...something my husband and I disagreed upon until we both read the book.
5,Great book!,"I love this book! It is filled with great ideas, and organized by age range. The pictures are large and very helpful along with the descriptions of the activities. Even if you think you may have thought of some of these ideas on your own, it's hard to know when to introduce each activity and what specific skills it is building. This book is a great resource."
1,You don't need it,"I don't think you need the book if you are somehow able to play with your baby. The games described are very basic. You are probably playing them accidentaly. There is basic information on how babies interact at what month. This you can find inWhat to Expect the First Year (What to Expect (Workman Publishing))or similar books. You may need a Gymboree class, Gymboree outfits but you don't need this book."
3,NO New ideas in this book-only buy if u have not bought ANY baby items.,"This book is very good and give you a lot of ways to interact with your infant and to help his development. However, a lot of the things are things child development books tell you to do and include things that are products on the market.For example, the book has how to make tummy rolls from towels but, i had already purchased the boppy tummy time mat for this. If i had known or even thought about this towel method before I bought and opened the package then I would not have purchased the boppy.A couple other examples are the play mat and mobile. This book tell you how to make them with things you already have in the home. Not much use if you have already assembled the baby's room and used the play mat. This is pretty much how things in the book are. There are no NEW ideas in this book."
5,A beautiful selection of music nicely performed,I enjoyed this music even after playing it several times. The selections vary from each other making the performance a delightfrul listening experince.
5,Pachelbel: Canon and Gigue in D,"Absolutely beautiful! I wore my original one out and had to replace it. For those who love the Kanon, it is eloquently represented. This one is definately a keeper!"
5,"THE Most BEAUTIFUL Version of CANON, EVER!!!","I have a much longer review of this version on 'Canon In D and Other Baroque favorites' Also by Paillard.As this same version is also on that one.I cannot say enough about this version of Canon. I've been more than obsessed by it ever since I heard it in and at the end of 'Ordinary People'. I stood transfixed, crying at the soothing-gentleness and intense power of it. I had my father 'loop' it. (make it play over and over again). I've performed Ballet to it.... I play it for everyone who knows me, and make sure they know to connect me, my soul, my personality, with that version of Canon In D. It is sooo incredibly intensely unforgettable. It marks you for life. You will never forget it once you hear it. It is so perfect, Pachabel must've heard this music in Heaven and transcribed it for our earthly ears. You will never be the same after being exposed to such an incredibly rich, soul-touching piece of music."
5,Music for the Soul,"If you are on a desert island and have only one piece of music, this is THE ONE. This is the ultimate, interpretation of Pachelbel's Canon in D. I played it for a 90 year old woman. About 3/4 of the way through, a bony hand came out between the covers and wiped a tear. Later she said, ""This is the piece of music I wish to hear in my last moments."""
3,poor sound quality and not the best performance of the canon,"I agree with the folks that say that this is not the best performance of the canon. It's played at the pace I like, but there is this plucking throughout that is very loud and you can hardly hear the real music. I didn't buy this for the canon, although I wish it was as good as most of the other reviewers say it is. I got it for a couple of other works by Pachelbel which are hard to find. Those are good compositions but it just doesn't sound good on this disc. The sound quality is pretty bad, it was recorded in 1968. I have other remastered discs from this time and they don't sound this bad. Still though if you just want to check out a couple of other works by Pachelbel(or Fasch) I guess it may be worth it. Just don't expect anything that will blow you away."
4,better version of Canon in D available...,"I have heard better versions of Pachelbel's ""Canon in D"", although the other selections in this CD are quite amazing...There is also a version which was created by Mozart, with lesser tone and rhythm than Pachelbel's own, but I still highly recommend it.The original, or the intended form of the music, was for the organ, although you rarely find a version of it with an organ. Most that I've heard are playing the song with violins, pianos, or a whole concerta. If you'd like to find out where to download better versions of the song, email me...I also have the ""Long Form"" of the ""Canon in D""...also ""Canon in D-dur""...the ""Long Form"" is almost thirty minutes long, and composed by Mozart. Although it is less toned, and doesn't hit many high notes, it's still favourable...email me on where to find it!"
4,Grouch in his usual form,"This is a good Grouch album. If you like his others at all then this one is worth having. The track with Eligh is excellent, and one of the standouts. As with all of Grouch's albums (still haven't heard Crusader For Justice), it's quite consistent, especially rhyme-wise. The beats are all pretty dark and somewhat simple, not quite as distinctive or memorable as those off his other releases. If you've heard Nothing Changes, it's a lot like that beat-wise. It's also on the short side. If youre just getting into the Grouch, I'd suggest F*ck The Dumb or Don't Talk To Me, which are what I consider his best, and a little more accessible."
2,close but not quite for my application,"used this cable to hook up a satellite receiver to a tv tuner card in a pc. went from composite on the sat box to S video on the tv tuner and had mixed results. while the signal came through in color (some adapters wouldn't transmit color at all) certain colors had a checkerboard pattern in them (mostly red but others as well). so while we could watch and record the tv signal the overall quality of the image was poor. purchased 2 cables with 2 satellite boxes and 2 tuners, so it probably wasn't a bad cable. both had the exact same results no matter what combination I tried. ended up replacing the cables with yet another adapter from yet another company (from best buy) and those finally worked good (4th solution tried). this is a weird routing as most people go from s video to composite and I was going the opposite way."
2,"Works, when seated properly...","The cable is heavy and seems like it's quality construction but unfortunately the s-video end has some issues.1.) The joint where the yellow casing and the metal male end meet is to large in diameter. It doesn't sit well in a video card that is a bit recessed in the back plate of a computer.2.) The metal male end is not crimped properly. If you look at an s-video cable you will see two dimples that jut towards the four pins. Unfortunately the male end on the one I received has very shallow dimples and does not 'grasp' the female end on the video card. I'm forced to wiggle the cable to get the signal to come through but I get lucky maybe 10% of the time.Again I want to state that the cable itself and the casings around the RCA and S-video end do not feel cheap, they feel heavy and sturdy; I just have a major issue with the s-video male end.I will contact the supplier about this issue."
5,Nice cable,I bought this cable to hook up my laptop to my TV using the S-Video connection on the laptop and RCA connector on the TV. It works great. Cable To Go delivered quickly.
5,it's perfect bought with Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6FT),it's work best on aspire 5670 with the Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6FT) for audiohight quality and long inuf
3,Good construction but noisy,"Simply put: if you want a decent cable for passing video over to your TV set, this is the one, but somehow it gets sound noise from the PC thru the TV. I don't know why, because there's no interference source near, but i will uodate this and tell you."
4,Additional info,"With respect to the wrong font being used in the accompanying guide, this was apparently a problem with one batch. I sent an e-mail to info@pentonoverseas.com and they were able to send me a corrected version."
1,A dictionary on CD,"I put in the CD and was appalled. Its a long list of words spoken in English then spoken in Russian. That's it. It's like having a Russian-English dictionary on CD. No introduction, no explanations, just word in English then in Russian.I had just used the Michel Thomas set for Russian and was MUCH happier. The format of 'here is what we are going to learn, this is why it is, here is an example and here is how you can use it with other words' is way more intuitive and intriguing than listening to an endless list of words in two languages."
4,Great Strings,"Firstly, I am a hard rock/ metal guitarist and i absolutely LOVE ghs. But, as you'll se in my pros/cons, this could've been a better pack.Pros: The 6-4 strings are great if you like Drop A-B tunings. These things will probably last a pretty good while!Cons: The 3-1 strings aren't big enough. In my opinion, their your basic ""G B E"" strings. Should've been DY24, DY18, and plain 14.Thanks for reading:)"
4,Interesting Images,"I always give Herzog benefit of the doubt, but Fata Morgana's narrative isn't worthy of the stunning images. 4 stars just for going into the heart of the Sahara desert in the hottest and rainiest season (and adding Crispin Glover's Q&A) but needed research on Saharan landscapes, people, & animals. Update 7/19/12 Lessons of Darkness is more hypnotic with better music and less talk but only 54 minutes"
4,The filmmaker of the edge conditions!,Werner Herzog has been possibly the most intrepid director I have ever known. He likes to drown in deep waters where the edge conditions are present to break the unthinkable limits.And this a powerful statement. Fata Morgana is a true jiurney to the desert's sands and still more. He filmed too a very special document around a vulcano just hours before to make eruption in 1977.So this is an important document; visual and existential.
1,shelley,this mirror had broken places on it it. it smalled horrible. the person who sold it did not mail it on time. they are a bad business person 100%. was not happy with their service at all.
4,It does have high endurance,"This is a good product. It is not an anti-perspirant, so it will not stop you from sweating, it is just a deodorant. It does work great though, this particular limited edition old spice has the arctic force scent, which smells awesome. It does its job and that's all there is to it!"
1,Warning!!!,The unit is being shipped with defective (lids) covers. After going through the whole start-up. The cartridges will not activate. The lids are not putting enough pressure to activate the sensors.You will find this out after spendinding your money & time call the (Non-toll Free Warranty Support). They are aware of the problem and shipped me another lid. The only problem is that this lid did not work either. You have to actually put pressure or step on the lid to make the Printer work. The minute you take the pressur off...The printer stops...HP Acknowledged they are having problems with this issue. However they still make you go through the time & expense of re-shipping. Telephoning and wasting time on hold...Never again
2,Power supply problems,"This is an excellent printer, but it may not server you well in the long run. There are numerous people, myself included, who have had the printer die mysteriously. One day, it will just not power up. Why? Apparently the power supply board is poorly assembled and excess glue material causes the components to burn out. The suggested repair cost - almost $300.I enjoyed owning my 1220 for almost 3 years. But my prevous HP printer lasted for almost 10 years, and I'll be in the market for a new printer and it sure won't be from HP."
4,A well rounded college text or introduction to ITPM,"Kathy Schwalbe has done a very good job with this book, which while mainly designed as a college text would also be a good read of IT specialists looking to move into PM, as well as those looking to take the PMP certification. The general PM principles of scope, time, cost, quality, HR resource, communication, procurement, and integration management are all given a full 40+ pages. The book concludes with a guide to using Microsoft Project 2003 (the fifth edition now available focuses on Project 2007), and a section on passing the PMP.I used this text for my first undergraduate IT/Project Management class, and was very satisfied. It was a great introduction to PM with a bias towards IT and technology. However, experienced PM's will probably not find anything new here.All in all, a very good introductory text that is informative and relatively easy to read."
2,Need it for a class.,This book was required for a college class. I would not have bought it if it was not required. Very dry reading and not really to the point.
3,How can I read it if I don't have?,"Looks like a great book, among all options, I decided for this one as the best once it has many topics that I need for my studies. However, how can I read the book or tell if it fulfills my expectations if I haven't received the book? When I ordered the book at the beginning of the semester I was told it will take most of the common time to be shipped, but more than two months later and most of the semester gone and haven't received!"
4,Excellent Description,"Fast Delivery, Accurate description of product, excellent condition, no missing pages, would recommend to anyone."
4,Very Pleased,"I recently graduated from a 14"" TV to this 27"" one. I wanted something that was both bigger and compatible with DVD, Video, and a home theater system.I am very pleased with it. Especially with the DVD. The picture is so clear and lifelike it is like being there when I view my favorite Musical DVD's by Bill Gaither and His Homecoming friends.(Also sold on Amazon.com} It's great to have an TV like this that makes in-home concerts possible. I compared the price with a place a man I work with claims always has a low price. This price was far better than where he recommeded."
3,"Good content, but too quiet","Decent content, well organized. Unfortunately, the audio level is so low that you have to crank the volume way up. Forget that you did that (or fail to react fast enough when the track ends) and you blow your ears out when the next track starts."
3,"Very nice design, that could use some tweaking","I am an HVAC technician, and use this on the job to record my hours and fill out job sheets.The design is quite nice because of the 'compartments' on this thing. You can keep extra sheets in the back cavity, filled out sheets can be secured in the middle, and then your current sheet clipped on top to write on.Reason this isn't 5 Stars:-Not super-sturdy. Its made out of aluminum, but quite thin. To me the thing feels flimsy - I'm sure it will last a while, but I would prefer a little more heft.-A minor point, but the clip that locks in the current sheet of paper is aligned a little weird. When you have a new sheet of paper and try to slide it into the jaws, it will hit the bottom jaw. Therefore every time a new sheet is to be inserted, you have to start it in yourself. As I said a minor point, but it is an inconvenience.Still is a good product, and I will continue using until I find one that's better made."
3,NOT BAD,"I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT WHICH WASN'T A BAD CHOICE; HOWEVER, I FOUND A BETTER DEAL FOR LESS MONEY AND THE SAME PRODUCT"
3,flawed masterpiece,"This may go down in history as the defining novel of its generation: a Great Gatsby or On The Road for post-Reagan America. Unfortunately, its overwhelming message for me, as a non-American, is that here is a generation that has given up. Where is the hope? What is the future for these people beyond self-indulgence and a series of McJobs? Is this what America is becoming: a land full of well-educated wasters? A good read but profoundly depressing if you give its message some thought. A brilliant novel if Coupland's vision is proved right. I hope he is wrong."
3,X Marks the Plot,"Read this book for the cultural definitions contained alongside the prose. The story is not particularly moving, but the side commentary is fun and often insightful."
3,Cool cuts about junk,"The emptiness and boredom of 90's (to be more precise: end-half of 80's & 90's) is nicely handled throughout the volume. Insights on details of middle class exploitation thru use of ever cheaper, low (no!) future employees, smile-covered despair and fall of dreams of independency (start-up businesses yielding to mergers) are shockingly sampled. New nerd-words and associated living forms (!), alias dubbed as ""X'ers"" are sarcastically worked out.Despite these above stuff, I will complain of the discontinuous style this book has been written. Often you may lose the orientation of events and characters.More to say, this may sound weird but I don't know why; hard-rock culture and its sub-cultural influence which ruled a non-negligible amount of X'ers during their adolescence, is way neglected of the content.Anyway, cool debut, a nice dig into 80-90 generation, carried out way insufficiently, but still alive to enjoy."
1,try the other books first,"i read generation x several years ago. it was the most boring book i had ever read. i thus decided that douglas coupland was absolutely overestimated and that i would never bother to read any of his books again. some years later, i came across 'life after god', and thought the title sounded quite promising (also i believe one CAN judge books by their covers). i bought it and loved it. after that i read 'microserfs' - brillant. now i am reading 'girlfriend in a coma' - just wonderful so far. i might reread 'generation x'. but i believe one shouldn't start off reading 'generation x'. (by the way: there's a spelling mistake on the cover of 'life after god'. the word is zeitgeisty, not zeitgeiTsty. and, douglas, can't you keep your publisher from writing 'zeitgeisty' all over your books? tiring habit. not-very-deep-and-meaningful-word-AT-ALL.)"
3,not so bad,"my review ov this book (first time) was a bit harsh, i had just finished the book when it was written, now, with some time to reflect apon the book i realize that it does actully have a point. Douglas Coupland makes the reader face a question that smacks you in the face: Whats the point? Not so much about the book, but about all ov life. Threwout the book all hte characters are asking the same question. After reading the bnook you can kind ov tell where they are comming from, because you acted the same way when reading it. Always waiting for something big to happen, always looking for a point and thinking nothing about the stupid little stories or the trivieal details. But when your done, thats all it is, and thats all life is, it is all one long streaming story that doesn't have much ov a point, you just have to sit back and let it in, let life happen instead ov analizing why it happens."
2,Boring,"Although it is intentionally written this way (postmodern) on purpose, the book is still very boring. The reader is left anticipating something to happen but is left with nothing. Humorous but not worth reading unless you have some extra time on your hands."
4,The manual on just missing the Baby Boom,"Very entertaining -- the novel tries (sometimes succeeds) to be deep and meaningful. It's the story of Dag, Claire, and Andy (narrated by Andy) and their lives together living outside of Palm Springs (get it? they're ""outside"" of the beautiful area...). Members of the 20-something generation, too young to be Baby Boomers. One of the more interesting aspects of the novel is its HyperText layout; with lots of artbits and definitions littering the very wide margins (textbook-wide margins). The novel is a great read and concepts and catch-phrases of a new generation are fascinating"
3,disappointed.,I really struggled to get through this book after getting it and picking it up with alot of anticipation. What i read was a book that is filled with characters that you could really have an easy time forgetting about. It seems like Coupland left the oven on a bit too long when he put these ideas for characters into his head when he was probably writing this book.
3,A book with no real plot or storry line,Through the many pages of mindless dribble we see the true nature of Douglas Coupland. The stories that his charactars tell each other is just a path into his own subconscious. the parrall lines of the charters is just a way to express his dissatifacation with the way his life seems to be heading
2,Tales for a pretentious culture,"Maybe I read this book 8 years too late, but after reading Coupland's dismal Microserfs, and the somewhat more enjoyable Shampoo Planet, I have heard it all before. I can't but feel that Coupland thinks he is very clever (Hey, mom! Look at me!). I am a Gen-Xer, but very little in this book says anything to me. Maybe I didn't spend as much time as Coupland in front of a television set. I just wish he would stop showing off."
4,um uh,I don't understand how anyone could call this a cultural study. Coupland writes fiction. Gen-X is fiction. It's a study of the author's imagination more than likely mixed with his own reality. I enjoyed it. Thank you.
4,Worth reading,"Being of the generation that inspired this book, I have always meant to read it and I finally did.First off, let me say that the book isn't very long and it won't take much of your time to read. Because of that and the fact that this is a famous and often referenced book, it is worth the time to read.The characters are self-righteous and they pretend to be so deep and caring about the world but they are really just afraid of failure and success. They are very whiney as I am and as are many of the same generation. Reading this made me think that ""the world isn't perfect and never will be, but there is no sense in whining about everything"".As I said, it is worth the time to read. It may be a bit pessimistic at times, but that is part of its charm and it is written pretty well."
3,Reboot your life in the desert,"3 use-to-be-hip young people who suddenly grew very tired of the way their life was evolving, gives up everything to go live in the desert outside palm springs. They survive on ""Mcjobs"", and tell each other stories.The main character wanted to get away from the ""rat-race"" to get away from both internal and external ""noise"", in order to read 'the letter we all carry around inside - and some of us, if we're lucky, get to read.'An interesting angle, in a world where religion and tradition become more and more individual, and young people have to make their own lives full of meaning and purpose.I suppose part of the message is that you have to ignore other's expectations, and search yourself to discover what's right for YOU."
1,Don't waste your time,"Blah, blah, blah. Tiresome and uninteresting. I pity those that feel that this in any way defines any element of 'our generation'. It defines shoddy writing."
3,ok reading,"this was not a great novel, but then again this was coupland's first work. as such, it's pretty good in character presentation, style, and observations. it's a quick read, and one can definitely finish it within a day, although it took me several days as it wasn't a page-turner and i'd pick it up every once in a while.my initial attitude was one of pessimistic doubt: so this is the book that started the whole generation x thing? that's a lot to live up to. when not judged accordking to that high bar, it's a decent work written by a first-time novel writer. the prose and chapter illustrations have flair, and coupland evinces some funny deadpan irony. i wouldn't say that the characters here epitomize generation x, although they definitely display some of the qualities/morals that generation x-ers hold.i could take him or leave him, but i lean more towards checking out his other works."
2,not what i expected,"I read this book as a requirement for a 1st year english class. The teacher hadn't mentioned that it was a post-modern novel, so i read it as i would read any novel. I got lost becoz i didn't understand how each chapter was supposed to relate to the previous. I kept rereading chapters hoping to find some sort of understanding. After discussions in class, i still don't understand the basic meaning of the text.Though alot of the stories told by Dag, Clair, and Andy were funny, the book doesn't really have a true meaning, in my eyes anyway.So, if you are expecting to read a book that makes sense, this is not the book to read."
4,These mc's aren't like those other mc's,"This CD once again shows the vocal skills of LA's best. and some of the best true hip-hop mceys out there. This CD is jazzy and up beat, like peaceful.If You haven't heard this style You might not appericiate it,You will either think this style is the best thing Hip-Hop has produced or you won't feel it, but listen to it and you will love it. I recomended for anyone who likes aceyalone you go out and find All balls don't bounce his best album and my favorite album of all time.twice as good as this one."
3,Life Must be Sparked Each Day and Night,"Haiku D'etat is the assembly of three of finest Project Blowdians in the world. At it's high points it is as FRESH as a pickl scratch and at its low point you can hit the skip button. Aceyalone continues to put forth sound, insightful verses while his A-Team partner Ab Rude does the same. The most pleasant surprise is the work of FF emcee Mikah 9 whose verses range from impressive to amazing, on ""Still Rappin'"" he emerges as one of the most talented emcees in the game, showing that time may place in the class of Big Ace, 2Mex, and other underground legends. The Project Blowed crew is beginning to gain notoriety all over the west coast and has even spread north to Vancouver and to major cities in the east like New York, Philly, and Newark. Swoop this recording up as soon as you can."
5,"Top-Notch, Ear soothing hip-hop","This album is quite a treat, and if you are familiar with the project blowed clique, then you know it will not disappoint. Up there with Haiku d'Etat's ""Coup de Theatre"", and Freestyle Fellowship's ""Shockadoom"", ""Innercity Griots"", and ""To Whom it May Concern"". Conscious and mind-blowing lyrics lacing musically rich jazz-influenced instrumentals, it's hard to ask for a better trio of lyricists to come together and compliment each other so well. Prepare to be refreshed and enlightened!"
5,"""Writing this review could be Dangerous!""","This band is completely entertaining! Wether you agree with their points of view or not, the emotion, drama, and music is worth the having. The band ROCKS PUNK! The guitar player can actually JAM! I don't think I have ever listened to someone so mad and sarcastic and at the same time funny! This is an amazing experience, at least I think so. Disclaimer: I do not agree with all of Docs thoughts but do agree with a lot of his disappointments with life on this earth."
1,Wrong product,Ordered front fitted floor mat twice and received two rear mats of different style both times. The rear mats they sent are junk by the way.
1,Wouldn't Know,"Have ordered twice and got the rear floor pans not the front as pictured - very frustrating. Everything else comes in right when I order it, but not this product."
5,I love this computer!,"My parents bought me a Compaq Presario on my 18th birthday and a little after a year, while I was away at college, the motherboard was fried. It was a piece of crap from the beginning, but after dealing with that, I decided I needed the best computer that MY money could buy.The electronic guys we have talked to said to buy either a Sony Vaio or an Apple, as they are the best made computers. Since I don't like Apples (not software friendly), I decided to buy a Sony! I couldn't have made a better choice! I absolutely adore it.The only problem is that it is HUGE. As a college student, I really can't take it to my classes but thats not much of a problem since I don't want to take such a nice computer to class anyways. But I did have to look really hard for a laptop case, which Sony doesn't make!All in all, I love the computer. Everything works well on it and I've had it for about 6 months now. It's great!"

5,Best mouse on the market,"I do not know what the others are talking about. It was easy set up, can program all 5 buttons. Works flawless. Was able to pick up 2 of these on Amazon for half off, wow."
1,It hurt my wrist...,"I'll have to return the mouse! I bought it because it has the ""ergonomic"" design. But I only used it for 2 hours before my wrist start hurting. I think the bottons are positioned too high. Also, the two side bottons are too far for my thumb to reach. I believe the mouse is designed for men with big hands. Not a good choice for women."
1,"NOT WORTH THE PRICE & VALUE, NOT PRECISE",Not very precise and not comfortable to the hands. I would highly recommend the Logitech MX700 mouse which is rated 5 stars. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE OR ANY MOUSE SIMILAR TO THIS ONE.
1,a waste of fourteen bucks,"I became interested in a holographic universe theory when I perused and regretfully did not buy a Scientific American issue on the subject. Too bad, because I'm sure the theory would have come under strict scientific scrutiny with maybe a glimpse of the far-out possibilities. This book starts very promising, discussing the beginnings of this model by Bohm and Pribram. After chapter two, however, as some previous reviewers have noted, the book descends into witchcraft and lunacy. The book would have been better off in the New Age section of the bookstore, not the science section, the reason I was fooled into buying it. I must say, I tried to read it over the course of three nights, and ended up throwing it out. Mr. Talbott unfortunately belies his lack of scientific knowledge/training by writing the last three-quarters of the book on the paranormal. Save your money."
5,A definate MUST-READ!,"This has to be one the best books I've ever read. Talbot challenges all that is known to modern day science by blending in the unexplainable. This book gives insight on some of the most mysterious things that happen in life. His ""Holographic Model"" makes the reader stop and think about all traditional teachings of science, religion and reality. It offers much to debate for the ""closed-minded"" and even more to think about for the ""open-minded."" Our perception of things has a great effect on the way we live. If you think that there is more to the universe than five senses, strap yourself in and enjoy this thought provoking ride!"
4,The Holographic Universe,"Wild, but feasible explanation of the existence of allpossibilities via an observational approach. Fun andintriging, Enjoy."
4,Fun and informative,"Talbot's book reads like a pot-boiler. I think I read it two sittings (the only other book that I read so fast was The Amityville Horror in 1978!). Talbot weaves his theory that the universe is a hologram around findings in neuroscience and particle physics. He then brings in every paranormal phenomenon one can think of to fit into this theory - reincarnation, out of body experiences, ESP, UFOs, psychokinesis, etc. etc. This is both the strength and the weakness of the book. While having a theory that describes all of these phenomena is like finding the Rosetta Stone, I found myself thirsting for alternative explanations as well, just to get a comparison. But still, Talbot's book is a page-turner and is recommended."
5,Amazon Review of Holographic Universe,"I've read many books on quantum physics and Michael Talbot's Holotropic Universe is by far the most understandable to date. His book is well documented from a diverse and well-known group of doctors, scientists, psychotherapists,etc. who are experts in their respective fields. The book includes a lengthy bibliography. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a scientific explanation for Psychic Phenomena, healing, as well as a viable theory of the invisible energies of God and the Universe. Michelle Lindey."
3,Interesting and flawed,"Yes, this book is an interesting and enjoyable read. And it will expand your horizons and make you think differently. But this comes at the price of plausibility.The book is centred aroud the theory that our universe is a hologram. The physics (largely at a quantum level) is explained well, as are the implications. These are divided into explaining unusual happenings to the mind and body as well as space and time.The problem is that the book, while not a New Age text as such, gives too much credence to events that aren't generally accepted in the scientific community. And when a book relates itself to the scientific method, it can't then go on to describe how the hologram theory explains miracles, almost taking their existence for granted.With a grain of salt however, it's delves into a very interesting question: what if everything (matter, space, time) is like a hologram - transient, malleable and self-contained? An enojoyable question to answer."
1,"DO NOT BUY, NOT A PHYSICS BOOK, JUST MYSTICAL BS","Beware: this book showed up as 'recommended' when viewing real science books (think I saw it on the Black Hole Wars from Susskind). The Holographic principle is the newest development in physics and I wanted to read more about it. This is the just paranormal stupidity. DO NOT BUY, National Enquirer is cheaper"
5,A profound and titillating view -the nature of our Universe,"Michael, it is my greatest pleasure to read this book and know that there is intelligence left on this planet. For a while there...I was beginning to wonder. ;) There are no limits except those which are self created. The actual facts have been clearly delineated by you, and only an ignorant or foolish person could refute them and choose to remain in illusion. A great work of both science and intuition, melded into one. Thanks for this tasty morsel. Good food for thought!"
5,a life changeing book,"i picked up this book after a party early in the morning ,with a cronic hangover began reading from that point in time my whole outlook changed radically. The theory of reality put forward in this book and the premise that all things are interconnected and the clear way in which these theorys are explained allows everyone to begin to wonder about the nature of existance, and offers hope of existance limited only by the constraints of the human mind truly we are what we think.thank you michael for a wonderfull book"
4,An innovative book which opens new questions,This book explains the scientific approach to mind and body relations. A good approach to understanding of holly spirit and basis of religions. In islamic religion holographic universe is explained as ALLAH which is the only being with different appearances according to your limited perceptions. This book should have been followed by others to help reach the relations between science and religion
2,many unjustified statements,"Pls do not take my words too seriously, as I am only half way through the book NOW. However, the more I read the more I find it more like a fiction book. Talbot does include references of almost all facts, but the way he rationalize them to be holographic in form is dubious and often unjustified at all. So I am put it aside now. I might continue when I am too free."
1,The only book I ever trashed...,"... And I mean, I actually threw it in the trash. To keep it would have been a reminder of money wasted. To sell it would have made me feel guilty that someone might read it and believe it.The central hypothesis is simple: the brain has properties similar to holograms, therefore, the universe is one big holographic projection of the mind. Logic is notably absent from the rest of this book as well.If you are looking for answers, you would be well advised to look elsewhere."
1,Ooooops!,"Ooooops! I thought this was a book on science. My mistake....turns out to be a book on the occult! First two or three chapters get you hooked on the Holographic theory, which may, in fact, have some validity. But then it turns to the dark side....dreams, precognition, auras, etc, etc, ad nauseam, ad absurdum. Junk science! Right up there with Chariots of the Gods."
1,"Holographic, maybe not.........","If you beleave the universe and human beings display holographic properties than this book is just what you need. One of the best books ive read in a long time but still wasnt helping grasp the fact why only some humans can do extra ordinary things and others are only able to read about them. Wake up humanity, last call..."
3,everything can't be true.,"This book is well writen. If I agreed with the content I would give it a five. However, an author that beleives in psychokinesis, miracles, faith healing, levitation, ghosts and a million other unsubstantiated phenomena cannot be taken seriously. Someone who uses stigmata as an example to reinforce an arguement is not credible. This book, although it presents an interesting idea, kills it with [ridiculous] beliefs. Nebuchadnezzar?Get Real!!"
4,"Starts slow, but the 2nd half is AMAZING!","Did you know that if a person with multiplepersonality disorder gets drunk and switches to another personality unaware of the drinking, then the current personality will no longer be drunk? If you've ever wondered what the limits to the mind and our interconnectedness are, then this book will help you set your sights more accurately.More specifically, through its true stories and cited studies, it demonstrates that the world is not as we see it. This book clearly shows us that there is a richness and depth that go to such far reaches of our mind that we can't even comprehend it.This book has the potential to radically alter your world view forever... that is, if you can get past the first half of this book which is a bit content-dense and, in my opinion, not all that interesting."
5,Outstanding,"One of the top three non-fiction books I have read. This book is clear, concise, and to the point. Regretably, it ends. This book altered my conception of reality nearly to the extent of a controlled LSD experiment. Talbot's explanation of the universe resonates with a subconcious level of awareness just below our mundane perception. There are occurences in this book (yes, they are documented) that stagger the the human imagination. May you R.I.P. David."
3,"Been there, done that.","I'll confess that I have not yet read the book. I'd like instead to just comment on the reviews. First of all, the interest in higher dimensions has permeated all of mathematics and physics for about 100 years. So it's amazing that at this late date someone can come along and say ""the universe may have higher dimensions"" and still be applauded as a visionary. The idea may indeed be profound, but it is certainly not novel. (See ""Flatland"" for starters.) Second, the idea of holographic or distributed memory has been chewed-on and digested both in the fields of artificial neural networks and cognitive psychology. Consult any one of the hundreds of recent textbooks in these fields for the details. For myself, I'll look forward to reading Talbot's book, but based on the other reviews I can't say that the anticipation is killing me."
2,Nothing new,it is interesting but if you are widely read you won't find anything new you will see rewording of things that you have read in Huxley and other authors in other good books ever since Ferdowsi penned the first great work a couple thousand years ago and has been copied over and over ever since.I was hoping for something new after reading the review yet this was rehashing ideas that have already been talked about for ages before this was written some 20 years ago.The lesson it to do better research before getting something in the first place
4,Pseudo-scientific super story,"Approximately the first half of the book is brilliant, introducing us to wonderful minds like Bohm. The second half is, unfortunately, sullied with goofy guru stories presented in the same credible voice as used to describe quantum mechanics. No matter, it is a riviting read, not to be missed. The author died of leukemia in his 30's, unfortunately, but this is a significant legacy full of mind-expanding ideas which will lead you to read and learn more of reality and perception."
2,Sad,"I'm not going to repeat what others have already said here, just state one fact. Michael Talbot claims that because of the holographic theory and it's connection to the human mind, diseases can be cured just by willing them away. Michael Talbot died of leukemia in 1992, the year after this book was published.The two stars are for the first section...the rest is just wishful thinking, I'm afraid."
1,If the world was a pineapple,"If the world was a pineapple, than Mr Talbot could explain it in his model. Although some of the concepts are intriguing, Mr. Talbot's flair for stating the ""obvious"" when bieng highly subjective is so far from objectivism that it makes one question his profesionalism, if not his sanity. His sources for ancient data are questionable, and he seems to ignore a great deal of data to reach his conclusions. This book is for you if you have the emotional need to create fantasy where fact is not enough"
4,Ok,It took a little longer then usual but they where concern about it sending me a prom email..In general I am satisfied.
2,another reader,"I agree with some of the distaff comments here. This book proves that if you give people a light they will follow it anywhere. In this case, the hologram is strutted across the stage as a governing principle of the universe. It explains everything and therefore explains nothing. One seems to forget that paradigms are a dirty word in science. They block inquiry, prejudice experience and bind the intuition into a straight jacket of facile panaceas. For those who wish to feed their occult conceits with poorly substantiated scientific half-trues then this book is for you. If your mind seeks knowledge through skepticism and open inquiry, then pass this one over."
2,We Need to Get Some Air In Here.,"Talbot's book claims to be the revelation of a new scientific theory about how the universe works. But this is really not science at all; maybe it's a precursor to the science, but just as likely, it's the highly-inflated aftermath of a night of unusually good weed, captured and edited into publishibility before it could waft skyward, as weed was meant to. This is Talbot's real legacy to the literature of the paranormal. How did he do it? Why can't I do it? I've got to *try*..."
3,It's a good collection of paranormal stories,"Firstly, I want to say that when anybody tries to find a ""scientific validity"" for paranormal phenomena, things are gonig to fall flat on their face... Starting out with this idea of a holographic universe, and then trying to apply that idea to all the events in the book is basically an exercise of a solution trying to find a problem... It doesn't work very well on that level...However, what made this book interesting for me is that it's a unique collection of stories about paranormal phenomena, either experienced by the author or re-told by the author from other sources... Since the author wasn't there to experience or witness a lot of them, it's kind of being told, this happened sometime, somewhere.. So, if that event interested me, I could research it further... So, on that level the book worked for me... And yes, be aware that some of the stories are going to be a little outlandish... :)"
4,Very interesting and informative - fascinating info,"It is a brilliant book and I am enjoying it, but it is sufficiently scientific to require close attention and some effort, so I am reading it in shorter spurts - and loving it because it explains so much about how the universe works and why it seems to work as it does."
5,so its all a long dream after all.................,"Have you ever had a dream where everything in the dream was 'real' when you were in it? You could feel the touch of things and even smell things? Well it seemed too real UNTIL you woke up. Now it seems LIFE could be the same case too! It is as if this universe is just a thought or a dream.This book gives examples of experiments in Quantum Science that show the universe is too strange and sometimes seems 'illogical' to our reasoning. And we know time is a relative human construct, since the real 'time' is ALWAYS ""NOW"" in the present.This book is truly great."
3,Fascinating... but not scientific,"I have to admit, once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. But one soon gets the sense the author is so desperate/enthusiastic to believe in these phenomena that his views are obviously biased, and he fails to balance his 'beliefs' with scientific fact (or is it that he avoids delving in too deep in the fear his theories will be disproved and his precious beliefs shattered?) For instance he fails to acknowledge or account for those who have experienced horrifying NDE's (and there are many!!).Despite the fact he fails to provide convincing scientific evidence, I still found it quite fascinating and thought provoking."
5,An absorbing mix of scientific and mystical philosophy,"When I first read the basis of Talbot's hypothesis, I was very taken aback. But as I read more of his reasoning and research and how it all fits into a very probable scenario, it all started to make sense. It is a very far reaching idea that actually makes it. Fantastic reading and very, very thought provoking. Enjoy!!!"
1,A disgrace.,"I wish I could give this book zero stars, but I can't.Anyhow, why is this book a disgrace? Simply because it misrepresents the ""Holographic Principle"" and how it can and should be applied (hint: there is no evidence that it can be applied to the real universe in any way or form and is simply a mathematical model, not a representation of reality). In addition, it gives not credit to the REAL people behind the principle (another hint: does the name Leonard Susskind mean anything to the author?).In short, this book is wrong and is simply a collection of stupid ideas tagged onto a scientific theory in an attempt to lend them credibility and sell the book."
5,Fascinating!,"I love the the universe and the simplest understandings of it. It jives with another mystic, Itzack Bentov who also viewed the holographic mind interpreting the holographic universe. When two great minds agree on the same thing, I understand things better. Great book, the Holographic Universe!"
4,interesting,"The author brings up very interesting points, and even some I had not come across before. I my opinion, he tends to rely on older or anecdotal evidence to support his theory, and/or relies relies rather heavily on the reputation of David Bohm."
4,Almost made it!,"This is a great book that gives a clear perspective on the way this 3D realm operates. The author lost me in the significance of UFO paradigms and the holographic universe, so I will go and seek deeper Jungian understanding of this possibility and re-read those sections. Otherwise, a great book!"
3,Everybody chill out,"Everybody has a bias, including me, though we usually don't admit it. Talbot, like many folks, early experienced the validity of what some like to think of as ""paranormal crap."" If you've had precognitive dreams, OBE, NDEs, etc., you get tired of people who think you're nuts, since you know what you've experienced, and you know what we call science and philosophy can be incredibly narrow-minded. (See Stephen Braude's works for a philosophical discussion of this point.) That said, Talbot, now deceased, did, in the second part of his book, employ very little skepticism in his discussion of so many areas of paranormal reality. However, the first part, where he discusses Bohm and Pribram, is about as lucid a discussion of holograms as I've seen in non-technical writings. So: buy the book for a good discussion of Bohm and Pribram, and take the rest with a grain of salt (though only if you have a scientistic bias will you find ALL of the rest to be ""crap."")"
5,Must read,Worth reading for everyone with any amount of curiocity about the world.Lot of good references. Fast paced and well written.
5,Should Be REQUIRED reading in schools!,"This is by far my favorite book. This is the story of the limitless possibilities of human potential. The idea in and of itself blows my mind and even though it's just a theory, it's a beautiful one and one i seem to experience in my everyday life. This is a book i read once a year because it never ceases to show me new things."
4,"A bit slow, but still beautiful.....................","On Erato, Kiri Te Kanawa's voice sounds radiant, rich and creamy of tone; she is commanding in 'Come scoglio' and tenderly affecting in 'Per pieta; which is more moving here than with Levine. Lombard is a sympathetic accompanist, if not always the most perceptive of Mozarians; some of his tempti are on the slow side, but his sextet of young singers make up a team that rivals almost any other, giving firm, appealing performances. With warm recording of high quality, this is most enjoyable and could be a first choice for anyone who loves to follow the singers in question in this opera. Me, I adore the voice of 'Kiri Te Kanawa.'"
5,One of the best.,I loved this anime. Bought on a whim and can't say I regret it. I mixes humor in to almost every thing and still makes you think about whats really going on. Can't wait for vol 3 to be sent to me and for vol 4 to be set up for DVD.Kristy :)
5,Interesting and unique story,"When I first saw Generator Gawl, it looked a bit stupid. But you actually get to watching it, its pretty interesting, with a cool animation style. Generator gawl is pretty good, considering the fact that it isn't a well known anime in the US."
5,Generated to Excellence,"A truly excellent moment in anime history. Generator Gawl is most possible one of the best dubbed animes I have ever seen, not to mention that the voice actors cast for each role are absolutely perfect. This DVD is packed with action, humor, and even some romance and drama; it's got everything you could ever want! The only thing I could complain about would be the lack of extra features, although the schematics of each generator shown in this particular DVD is pretty cool, since they're worth taking a second look at. All and all, this anime has become my favorite, and if you buy this DVD, you'll see why - it's addicting!"
1,BEWARE - CONFLICTS WITH McAfee !!,"After spending months burning all our CDs to MP3s, I was excited to get get the SMC multimedia streamer so that we could listen to our entire music collection on the stereo. However, when I went to install the SMC Media Server software that is needed to operate the device, it would not run, and SMC technical support provided zero help!After hours of effort, here is what I discovered... My McAfee virus software was conflicting with Media Server. But simply disabling the virus software did not remove the conflict. In fact, I had to completely uninstall the McAfee software from my system to get the SMC device to work.So BEWARE - if you have McAfee antivirus software, this product will NOT WORK on your wireless network!"
1,Good product in pre beta testing phase,"Great concept. SMC products have provided great customer service & GUIs & stability for me in the past... DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION OF THIS PRODUCT!!! (Feb 6, 2004)The installation software worked fine, but when I launched the SMC Media Server program, only Apache Server worked... Without the SMC GUI, you cannot specify which directories or files will be served to your home theater.Customer Service does not have record of the product in their database. Second-Tier customer support suggested the problem was that I had too many media files :PTry Neoware for a thin client or PrismIQ for a low priced media server or Roku for a robust media server."
1,not as wonderful as it sounds,"As mentioned by others, the interface on the TV is rather clunky and reminiscent of an old video game unit or something; lacks in response, and the remote had to be pointing very, very directly at the unit. I had to reconnect it a second time, and couldn't get it to recognize my home wireless network... which works just fine. Anyway, I just wanted to have my album collection available for play on my home stereo. Be warned! You cannot select an album for play in its entirety... you must go through and play each song manually, in order, if you want to do this. I called tech support and they confirmed that you cannot select play at the album level. You also cannot select mp3's for play, jukebox style, and put them in que... in by book, that sucks. Who wants such a dumb unit that you have to babysit constantly to hear your music?The only alternative I suppose, would be to create a playlist on your computer for EACH album... but who wants to go to that much trouble?"
5,horror toho style,this is a lost classic. you gotta see this movie if you want to see some entertaining stuff. it may not be for monster fans but if you look at it as a horror movie you will definately enjoy it..everything from the directing to the effects are tight. well..later.!
3,Can a human vapor get gas?,"There are many, radically different versions of this film. This is the one to get.The one entitled The Human Vapor is not."
1,Can not recomend,My binding fell apart after a week! The pictures are okay but it smells like her agent wants a bonus. I can not recommend this book.
1,This scrapbook needs more content,I can't believe I bought this book. I finished it in 2 minutes. Why was this book made? Many of the photos in this book can be found in her autobiography. She is recylcing photos and information. I'm sad about this book
1,Strong opinion,I have a strong opinion about this book. It is a big waste of time and money. There isn't any text. It's all a bunch of pictures pasted on a few pages. It looks like it was made in five minutes. I hope the author donates the proceeds to charity because it's wrong to make a profit from young kids who bought this garbage.
4,Essential reading for Percy or Foote fans,"It is a rare treasure to find a book like this. ""Correspondence"" gives insight to the artistry, friendship, and psychology of two gifted writers/curmudgeons.A little advice to the prospective reader. Forgive Shelby Foote his apparent crankiness, which may be the most notable feature of this book. As other reviews note, Percy is absent through much of the volume. Foote's tone, already tinged with youthful didacticism, is transformed into a soliloquy which is boastful and (at times) rude.Appearances may be misleading, however. While on the surface egotistical, Foote's often incisive letters betray far more complex motives. He searches for true conversation, for a way to gauge his art (his central pursuit). Percy may come across as aloof, or even vague, but this may be due to the hidden lifelong friendship behind these letters.A wonderful read"
3,"Too much Foote, Not enough Percy!","I bought this book because of an enduring love affair with the literary works of Walker Percy. As an addition to the literary biographies of Percy written by Samway and Tolson, the letters serve their purpose well. As a letters volume on its own merits, The Correspondence of Shelby Foote and Walker Percy is unbalanced. Apparently, Foote didn't start saving Percy's letters until the exchange had been occurring for some time. Nevertheless, it is thoroughly interesting to observe Foote's massive ego as he lectures Percy, having the knowledge that Percy ultimately became the far greater literary star. If you've already delved deeply into the work and history of Walker Percy, you'll need this book. If not, find a different starting place, this is not a good place to begin."
2,A talking phrasebook.,"If you're looking to learn French as an entire language, and not just chopped up phrases, then put this down. The CD's do nothing but state the English phrase, then the French phrase twice. There is no grammar, no cultural notes, not even an introduction or a guide to pronounciation, so the learner has no starting point whatsoever. It doesn't help that the lady's high pitched voice makes you never want to hear French again. If you're traveling, or if you have other resources, then this CD might be useful to some extent. If you're planning on actually learning French, don't get this."
2,Not the easiest was to learn,"I wasn't very impressed with this audio tape. Unless you have taken french classes in the past I don't think you would be able to learn anything with this. All it does it say a phrase in English and repeat it in French...and it moves very fast. It doesn't explain grammar rules or help with pronounciation. I would reccomend this for someone who already knows some french, and just needs a refresher before they travel to France. Also-most of the vocabulary in the first volume pretains to travel. So unless you are actually going to France I would not buy this."
1,Learn in your car French,"I hate to be negative. I absolutely love this series, having purchased and worn out my Level I and Level II Learn in your car Spanish. So I was very excited to get my French Level I tapes.I purchased Level I and discovered that, while the companion instruction book was excellent as usual, the tapes followed this pattern: side 1, side 2, side 3, side 3. There was no side 4. Thinking it was a fluke, I returned the Level I set to get another, and the same thing happened. Side 1, side 2, side 3, side 3. So I took it back AGAIN and have resorted to auction sites to find a previous printing that hopefully has all four sides of the tape.Penton needs to improve its QA process to prevent this from happening in the future."
2,Somewhat useful but with some serious omissions.,"Six weeks prior to going to France, I ordered the CD's. Used them daily prior to the trip and found them helpful to refresh my limited French from years ago and prior trips. A glaring omission: The CD's teach you to ask for a menu in English, but give you absolutely no food items in French!!! This is a real problem, given that you gotta eat in France and not all restaurants have their menus translated into English, or if they do, there are still some French food names sprinkled throughout. This can be alarming if you do not care for tripe or some other non-translated specialties. A lesson on basic food names would be essential for this series to be really useful to a newcomer to France. Can't really recommend it."
2,not as funny as i remembered,i got it super cheap here though so not the end of the world. there was one episode that was hilarious start to finish but the others were hit and miss.
3,Trailers Trailers Trailers,"If you like watching 5 minutes of MANDATORY trailers each time you play a DVD - this is the one for you!!Sig Others is great -- but SHOUT!! (the releasing company) should realize that the only mandatory playback should be the FBI warning - NOT their trailers. Consumers buy content, not promos.Just wait for the repeats on BRAVO and TIVO them."
2,A War Story,"The Psycho Realm is back again to hit us up with another average release, only this time without B Real. Unfortunately, B Real was one of the few highlights on the group's debut, as the other members lack the skills to carry a full album. Still, if you liked their first one, you might be able to appreciate this one too."
2,Bad mouse response,"After using this product for about three weeks I am pretty sick of it. While the keyboard is nice, the mouse is what drives me crazy. The left-click button only works about half the time I click it. Considering the left-click is the primary interface with a computer it needs to be reliable. I WOULD NOT get this if I were you. I am ready to throw the mouse against the wall. If I still had the box I would return it."
3,Not Quite Elite,"Would only recommend keyboard if you have a real need for wireless and would NOT recommend mouse.As some other reviews have already pointed out, the keyboard has poor ergonomics, unorthodox key placements, and I find the pressure required and depression length uncomfortable.On the upside the ""hot"" keys are convenient and useful, I have had no noticeable typos over the wireless connection, and the materials of construction are top-of-line in the wireless category.The mouse has noticeable response problems (even when the signal and battery strength are at their maximum) and is heavier and bulkier than typical design (due to the two AA batteries). I was hoping without the cord it would make for smoother and more convenient navigation, but it has actually ended up the contrary."
3,Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Elite,The keyboard works fine but mouse that comes with it does not. I could not make mouse to work with the keyboard instead use the separate wireless mouse which works fine.
1,Weird keyboard,"""Home"" ""End"" ""Delete"" ""Pg Up"" and ""Pg Down"" keys are in the wrong place. Until getting this keyboard, I never realized how much I used these 5 keys, particularly ""Delete"". Although I am getting use to the new placement, I must unlearn the placement ever time I use a different computer with a normal keyboard, such as at work. I really don't care which placement is better from an engineering standpoint. With keyboards, consistency is really important. Finally, I am finding I have to hit keys twice sometimes to get the keyboard to type. I have moved the receiver around with no improvement. I did not have this problem with my last cordless keyboard (logitech). Maybe that is a result of bum batteries (they come with the keyboard)."
2,DONT buy this IF UR A GAMER,"dont buy this piece of junk its so bad when i play my games my the w button dosent work some times to move foward and i have to press it really hard the mouse it nice and all and i like the online and media buttons but is not goo for gaming i had a logtech mx 700 elite due and that was great and i really like that but the mouse broke so i had to throw it out well all and all this is a bad keyboard cant belive i wasted my money and it not very durable, so if u get angry when u play games dont get it because i baged on it and the flip up thing broke and now i have to return it and get a new one"
3,"Works, but makes some major modifications to your system!","The product performs as I expected it would - well. My gripe is that the installation program ripped out the mouse software on my two laptops when I installed drivers. My touchpads now cannot be configured. For example, I normally disable the ""tap to click"" feature and now both laptops have this turned on with no option to tweak those settings."
2,"Wireless does not equal ""farther than desk""",I bought this keyboard after having a great experience with my previous roommate's Logitech Wireless keyboard as a controller for our living room PC/Media station. We could sit accross the room and control the PC on our big screen tv perfectly. I browsed around and ASSUMED incorrectly that most wireless that has been made recently should be the same. HUGE MISTAKE. This setup barely reaches farther than the advertised six feet which comes no where close to making it to my couch. So in essence i have a worthless 100$ keyboard that I bought with such haste that my new roommate threw out the box before I could test it.DO NOT BUY THIS if you need or want it to go anywhere actually off your desk. If i wanted something to stay on my desk id save the 50$ and buy a corded setup.
3,Wow. This thing is HUGE.,"It's the biggest keyboard I've ever seen. The wrist-rest is not detachable, and is causing my wrists to be resting on the corner of my desk, which seems like a sure fire way to guarantee carpal tunnel. The keys are kind of mushy, but not too bad.The mouse is really heavy and strangely angular compared to my previous microsoft optical (was wired). It's ""ok"".Programmable keys are pretty cool, though.If I had tried this out before I got it... well, wouldn't have made the purchase. I wanted a wireless keyboard/mouse setup for a cleaner and more relaxing work environment but now the keyboard is taking up twice as much space as my previous one.Primarily, what this keyboard has going for it is its huge size, if that were a good thing. But it's not."
2,dissapointing performance,it doesn't work as good as it should. it looses connection even if it's only a few inches from the port. extremely disappointing. the additional buttons and options on the keyboard are nice though.
4,GREAT SET WITH GOOD RESPONSE,"THE GOOD...Love all the features on this keyboard and mouse,The favorite keys are great,Signal quality is great,Ergonomics are also great,The two programable thumb buttons on mouse are nice,Love the scroll wheel and back/forward buttons on keyboard,The new side scroll, left and right, is convienient,Great feeling mouse, fits in hand wellTHE BAD...The new soft scroll wheel is hard to use in games,Occasionally, almost never, keyboard buttons will not work on the first strike during gamesDO YOUR RESEARCH ON MANY WEB SITES ANT GO TO STORES (IE. BEST BUY, CIRCUIT CITY) TO TRY THE UNITS FIRST THAN BUY ONLINE. I SAVED $45 WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ON AMAZON."
4,"It's OK, but ...","I purchased this keyboard about a year ago, and well, the range kind of sucks. I usually sit on my bed and watch tv shows on my computer, and I was hoping i could control the computer from my bed which is ~ 2 meters from the computer and no luck. But, overall I love this keyboard, it really is my favorite, the shape, design, everything. I recommend it."
3,"great features, but lacks good design","This keyboard works great and does what it promises, but I wouldn't recommend it. The keys look pretty cheap, personally I do not like the design where you can see through the keys. Any dell keyboards' keys would most likely look and feel better. The elasticity and the action/reaction of the keyboard feels weird to me. If you care about ergonomics, this keyboard is not the best one. My hands just don't feel comfortable when typing. The mouse is pretty big, too big in my opinion. I have another microsoft wireless optical mouse that's smaller and feels better. The keyboard is also too big I believe, but I probably prefer smaller keyboard than a lot of people.pro: good wireless range, keys for easy access to various windows programs.con: looks better on picture, not so good design, not so good action and feel."
2,Slow response. Sketchy signal,very ineffective signal. too picky about whee it is placed. often confuses simultanious commands between keyboard and mouse (awful for gaming)
4,Good goods,"I just got the wireless optical elite, and I have to admit I like it a lot. The mouse is responsive and suppoedly has very nice battery life. Some reviews call it heavy and slow, but I disagree. I use my stuff for writing, research, and gaming, and the features these came with do all of that and then some. Some other reviews say the features are too limiting, and they may be for a high end user, but for basic computer use, I love this stuff.The buttons on the keyboard have great options as far as I'm concerned. I can auto open several favorite sites, and I love the scroll wheel on the keyboard as well as the media player features. Let's face it we're all stuck with Microsoft, and this keyboard uses windows features quite nicely.If you're looking for a solid wireless set up, this one ain't bad. I'd give it a five stars, but I'm not sure exactly what a keyboard and mouse could do to earn five stars... I'm glad I bought this one, though."
3,"Great keyboard, but wireless reception very marginal.","I love this keyboard as far as the layout goes, and the mouse has all the buttons you expect and works well if you don't mind largish mice. The biggest issue with this keyboard is with the RF reception. Microsoft includes a USB dongle that both mouse and keyboard interface with and in all of the environments I've tried it (two different work locations, as well as my home), the signal just doesn't travel very far. As long as you can place the receiver within INCHES of your keyboard and mouse, everything will probably be fine, but if you need it to be some distance away, like a couple of feet, perhaps due to a keyboard tray say, then you'll likely have reception issues and some of your key/button presses will get missed."
4,Track Listing,"1) Any Time, Any Place (R. Kelly Mix 5:11)2) I Get Lonely (TNT Remix feat. Blackstreet 4:16)Retail store promotion. 2001, Virgin Records."
5,"Wonderful, just wonderful!","I'll admit it. Although I am a voracious reader, I have been remiss in my enjoyment of the adventures of Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson. I have spent the last few weeks rectifying that lamentable omission in my literary background.Frankly, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are an absolute joy. Each story is a delight to read. To my mind Conan Doyle's short stories represent the best of mystery writing. They plumb the depth of the human heart and run the gamut of emotion.No one can truly say that he or she is truly educated in English Literature without reading Sherlock Holmes. (It's interesting -- even persons who tend to dislike mysteries -- tend to like Holmes and Watson!)Highest of all possible recommendations!"
4,classic sleuths,My 9 year old carried this edition of Sherlock around with him for a week. The replica images are cool; the type is a bit difficult to read. A great gift.
3,Gorgeous pics,"yummy photos, however I wasn't much impressed with her theories abt. color. I'm not familiar enough with the styles to comment, but am familiar with the cultural areas (such as Mexico and Morocco) that she discussed, and not only did I disagree, but it seemed as though even the photos chosen didn't support the commentary. The commentary was too limiting, the photography revealed a much broader world than described.Doesn't matter - as a picture book it's satisfying."
5,Great!,You don't really have to mess with these much. I'm pretty sure they're pre-stressed. I've been using them for a while now and don't have any complaints. :)
3,Okay...,"These strings are POWERFUL. These were made for rock. They sound super clean through the amp, and they do work with alittle distortion. Turn the gain up and it's over! My problem with them is that they will not stay in tune... I was a dedicated Ernie Ball man, and those naturally went out of tune after long periods of time. These go out of tune in the middle of playing... still one helluva bang for minimum buck. It's not a risk, they're good... just really annoying."
5,DREAMING WOMAN,"THIS CD IS FULL OF FAMILY VALUES, LOVE AND TENDERNESS. YOLANDA'S SOOTHING VOICE AND WONDERFUL DELIVERY TENDS TO FILL ONES HEART WITH LOVE AND COMPASSION. THIS IS A ""MUST HAVE"" CD THAT YOU WILL NEVER BECOME TIRED OF. WILL BRING TEARS TO YOUR EYES IF YOU HAVE ANY LOVE WITHIN YOU."
5,Just ordered it,"I downloaded a free song from this CD and the kids loved it! It's a very unusual version of ""Itsy Bitsy Spider""...almost punk rockish but I just had to laugh when I heard it! It gets my 3 yr. old twins laughing and giggling as well. I'm hoping the whole CD is just as fun. If it's not; I'll update!"
5,A conchological review!!!,"As a professional conchologist, I had been thoroughly suprised by the fact that not many authors had caught on to the element of using the cone shell for their element of death. I heard that this book used a cone shell for that very reason, and I just had to read it!!! This book takes you though an exciting, fun filled adventure of ups and downs that ultimately ends with death by a cone shell... it was an 'edge of your seat' thriller... i couldnt put it down... in fact a lil pee came out. this book is highly recommended by ME and all my conchologist friends... it has a permanent place on my night stand.And hats off to Paul Adirex for fully utilizing all of the excitment that the cone shell brought to this wonderful novel... truly wonderful!"
5,Great educational toy,This is a great toy that really helps to teach math skills. My 5 year old grandson uses it as he is learning to add and substract.
2,"OK, but Expensive","The shipping weight on this product is listed as 3 lbs, but it is actually only a pound. So, it's basically $20/lb for almond flour with shipping. It's very nice flour, but at that price it's just not worth it."
5,Compelling Movie Nostalgia Mystery,"I must begin my review by stating that I am biased because I think the author Wright is one hell of a writer (based solely on the Horn series as that is all I have read by him). This novel is nostalgic, with a good mystery, great plotting, believable characters and lots of heart.John Ray Horn was a somewhat successfull B movie ""star"" in the loosest since years ago and now does a little looking around for people that need help, aided by his sidekick Joseph Mad Crow, also a former actor (the Indian sidekick to John Ray's cowboy). John Ray is a sympathetic, believable Hero with a grounded set of morals and beliefs, despite the trampeling they often take. Wright is an author who evokes an age, both good and bad, when the world was a little younger and more naive, though not by much. Mystery fans everywhere should find Wright and devour anything he has written featuring Horn and Mad Crow."
4,"James West and Briscoe County, Jr meet Nancy Drew","I liked this book although it is rather unbeliev- able. We have a heroine who knows martial arts, knife throwing, trick horse riding and is an accomplished mesmerist; but, hey, it's all in fun. I though I caught a glimmer of Louis L'Amour in some of her characters and while I'd like some real characters, this was an entertaining read. I hope to read more."
5,an excellent alternative tentacles Jem!!!,"despite how you may feel about the whole dead Kennedys lawsuit, this is truly a rock 'n roll Jem, from guitarist East Bay Ray."
1,Damaged and truncated.,"I have seen this film, almost a masterpiece, years ago in the Madrid Filmoteca, and I have just bought this DVD, released by the studio SYNERGY (???). It is a very truncated and damaged edition. How do they dare to release such awful thing? DONT'BUY IT!"
1,Do not buy this,"I bought this copy of Lady Windermere's Fan from Synergy on DVD and I was very upset to learn that it is an edited version of the original Lubitsch film. If you are interested in getting the real version of this film, buy More Treasures from American Film Archives 1894-1931. It costs a lot more than this version, but it's the real untruncated version, and the musical score is much better."
5,A wonderful overview of the issues one faces in service,"Clearly written, each pages resonates with wisdom. The obstacles one faces in serving are clearly addressed, and turned in to tools to learn about ourselves. This book is a wonderful examination of the helping process, helping profession and the psychology involved in helping.I highly recommend it."
3,Good for quotes and stories,This wasn't a true favorite of mine for my intro class but it got many great points across and was very informative on why self care is important in the human service field and how what we do can really help. Maybe not immediately but in the long hull of a person's life!
4,Easy to use,"In spite of my Spanish sir name, until I purchased this CD set, I knew very little Spanish. After going through this first Learn in Your Car series however, I feel like I can speak broken Spanish to friends and family. I get a great charge out of it. No doubt, learning a second language after your childhood is a daunting task, but it is possible in my experience. Don't be fooled though, you must do the CD exercises again and again. Repetition is really important; it took me quite a long time to get past the first two CDs, and I have a very long commute.This first set of CD's really focuses on the basics, like travel, restroom, hotel, and restaurant phrases. I think that I will become far more appreciative of learning Spanish when I get the Level 2 CD's.Overall, I enjoyed learning Spanish in my car, and I do plan to purchase the follow-up series."
4,Convenient,"Hello.Nearly all of these lessons are a convenient size for those around-town trips - not too long, not too short - and are a great way to use some of those otherwise-lost minutes driving to and from work.Any less-than-ideal elements to these CDs? Yes. I have no opportunity to speak the Spanish I'm learning (apart from speaking along with the CDs), so most of my skill, so far, is in listening and reading rather than speaking. However, I can tell that when I find myself in a situation requiring the use of the language, it will be an easy next step.I've nearly completed this first set and will soon order the second.Adios!"
5,This is it!,I have never taken Spanish before - ( I speak Italian which was a major pain and a big mix up! ) I ordered this CD 5 weeks ago and just ordered the 2nd series. It is wonderful... It is clear and concise...no volume problems as you've read about the tapes. I can't believe how much I know. Do it! Get it!
2,Inexpensive but very boring.,"As a background, I have listenned to Rossetta Stone, Pimsleur, Michel Thomas, FSI, and Assimil language series audio. Learn in Your Car is the one I like the least. A series of English phrases along with their Spanish equivalents were repeated. Sometimes the grammar terms for the words were included. I found the grammatical terms to be distracting.Due to the low price your best alternatives are Assimil, Pimsleur Conversational series, and FSI. Assimil not designed to be used behind the wheel so that leaves FSI. FSI, which can be downloaded free, but I do not recommend it for beginners due to the fast pace of both the course and the audio lessons. That leaves Pimsleur Conversational as your best alternative and if you have a cassette player in the car, tape versions of the *full* course are available on auction sites at bargain basement prices."
4,Pretty much as expected,"The course is as expected. Not perfect, but a good value for the money. And since I have a very long commute each day it's nice to put the time to good use. The only lack so far is that there are no 'quiz' type sections so that one can test comprehension and retention in a controlled manner. I don't know if I'll be able to hold my own in the language when this is all done, but I suspect that if not it will be my own fault, not the fault of this product."
4,Good introduction,I would definitely recommend doing other things in conjunction with these CD's to get an introduction and overview of Spanish.
3,It's not bad,"While there are a lot of useful words and phrases on these cds, there are equally as many redundant and/or useless ones. I really don't need to know 7 different ways to say ""these suitcases"". I think if you have a remote so you can skip the next chapter easily, it's much more enjoyable."
1,Learn in your car Spanish,"Very boring, listen to spanish words and repeat. If it wasn't for environmental concerns I'd sail this CD out the car window.Mike"
1,A disappointment,"I bought this book because I saw a review by Michael Quinion (www.worldwidewords.org). Although I enjoyed many of the essays in the book, the book was so poorly organized, I found myself very frustrated while reading it. Just a few editorial changes would have greatly improved it. It should have an index. The essays should be identified by the date they were published in the quarterly. Short intros to each essay providing some context and updating of the subject matter, as appropriate, would have made a big impact with a small amount of work on the part of the editor."
3,problem with grinding noise,"I recently purchased a SBM-200 and was very satisfied with its operation. However, after a week of daily usage, the unit started to make some intermittant grinding noises. I don't know if this is a defect or as a result of normal use. I am going to exchange it for a new one. I'll keep youi posted on the reliability of the new unit.Sincerely,Jack LeeYorktown Hts. NY"
3,You get what you pay for...,"I own the magnasager, homedics shiatsu neck massager, homedics wave action massager, as well as a ""wand type"" massager.I ordered the SBM-200 because I am a big fan of the ""human touch"" type of massage.Unfortunately it arrived broken. The balls would spin but they would not travel up and down the length of the spine.At any rate, here is what I observed.1) The balls were a little more than the size of a marble. Because they were so small, the massager wasn't as comfortable as other massagers with roller-balls.2) The balls felt ""light"".3) The machine was as loud as any other massager in this price range.Overall, for $85-100 a person could do a lot worse. But if you are looking for a substitute for a nice massage chair, this is not it. If you are looking for a low cost massager that does more than just vibrate you might want to take a look at the SBM-200."
3,Vinyl odor is unbearable,"The SBM-200 shiatsu massager is heavenly. It's better than any massager I've used. However, the vinyl has a horrible odor. It smells like insecticide or almost like gasoline. Homedics Customer Service did not reply to my complaint about it."
1,a short life massager,"I was satisfied with the pad. It's superior to any other massager pads I have had. While I was recommanding it to all my friends, this baby died in just two month. What I can do now is to wrap it up and send it back for service. Besides, I have to pay the shipping for the 'round trip'."
3,"Good product, but not for small size person","...This is great product but I wish it can be adjust width and hight. I am only 5'1"" wear small size clothes. I need lots of massage everyday after deal with two little over active kids. I did not realize I got lots of bruised just below the shoulder after first use. It feels great expect bruises pain. :-< I also need the lower back get messager as well. Unfortunately, it is too high for me. I can only get this it works on my the middle and upper back. I would say this is great product for medium size person."
3,Dissapointed,"I bought the Homedics SBM-200 because I suffer from chronic tension in shoulders and neck muscles. I just sent it back. It works fine on the middle-lower back, but when it moves pass the shoulder blades it's useless, the massage balls don't touch your body at all. I am ordering next the model that allows one to adjust the width on the balls. I hope that makes a difference. I'll report on that later."
4,HoMedics SBM-200 Therapist Select Shiatsu Massaging Cushion,If you have sore and aching muscles this will definetly work out the kinks! The only down fall I found with it is sometimes the massage actually hurts a bit b/c it's so much pressure on your back!
5,Sex...almost better than...'nuff said,"We immediately fell in love with this purchase. It does a very good job of relaxing the back. I just wish it included the neck. I am large and muscled...240 pounds...and it works great on me. My wife is very petite...5'2"" on a good day and 114 pounds...and I think she enjoys it more than I do. She has to place a towel over the rollers. It is a strudy unit. It sits well in the chair we selected for it. (It is always waiting for us.) I don't feel like I have to keep my weight off of it. I purchased it for $79 with a coupon. My only complaint is there isn't a button that allows me to force it to concentrate on one area. I turn the ""lower back"" button on and off to force it to stay down there. Then I let it fly over the rest of my back after a while. We both love the fact that it shuts itself off after a certain number of series. (It feels like about fifteen minutes, though we've never timed it.) Don't wait. Buy now. I wish we had one years ago."
2,Great - while it lasted.,"Gear(s) stripped after 3 months. It's not a top of the line item by any means, so I didn't expect much, but this is ridiculous. Paid $70 at Sam's Club; not sure if it's worth fixing. I do like the heat feature."
2,Not Quite What I Expected,"While this item performed under my expectations, I don't think those of us with bad backs might benefit from it. The meandering ball that massages moves everso lightly...almost not touching the spots I think need massaging. It rolls up and down the back with not too much emphasis on any one place...almost hap-hazardly rolling back and forth. I have kept this item because it DOES provide some (little) relief. I think that the notion of it rolling up and down makes one feel a little better (psychologically). Finally, don't buy this if you're interested in having that range of motion that you get in the chiropractor's office. This one does not apply that pressure."
2,mediocre massage,I bought this model thinking i was buying the sbm300 and was thoroughly disappointed. I promptly returned it. The sbm300 is worth the extra money.
4,HoMedics Shiatsu Massager,"This massager works and looks great. A feature which can be improved is the ""idle"" one, the mechanism won't retract to make a comfortable seat cushion -- instead your back will rest on the massaging balls."
4,Healing Hands Can Rest- Back Massager,"HoMedics Therapist Select Shiatsu Back MassagerI purchased this massager for my husband. He is always wanting his back rubbed and massaged. Although he says this HoMedics product could never replace my healing touch-it comes very close! The massage pad does create a feeling of having a deep tissue and muscle rub. I need to sit with my back on it but not pressed too heavily upon it because the settings are a little too ""heavy-handed"" for me. But when my upper back really needed it this HoMedics Therapist Select Shiatsu Back Massager is the one to work out those back knots."
2,Works well then stopped...,"Homedics Shiatsu MassagerThis product is very good when it works. However, in a short space of time, and with very infrequent use, it stopped working and there is no way of getting it fixed. So disappointed because it really helped with my muscle spasms. Needs to be a sturdier product. 4 star for effectiveness, no star for durability."
3,Too much hype without follow-up,"While this product does help with my back, it does have it's shortcomings. Namly the fact that it's too short. I'm an average height of 5' 10"" and it only reaches between my shoulder blades. The price also seems kind of excessive based on how much I enjoyed the product. I didn't return it but I did kind of feel bad about spending that much money. After all the hype I was kind of let down."
4,Feels great,"The best massager I've ever used that wasn't a masseuse. A lot depends on the chair that the massager is sitting in. I could have an added heat feature but we cant have our cake and eat it too. Other then that, I'd recommend it to anyone (especially if you have back problems). You can specify it to work on your upper, lower, or both parts of your back."
2,Good while it last.. which wasn't much..,I was so excited when I received the package. It was so useful and I used it for 2 weeks an hour a day. Then the cloth that seperated the rotating arm just tore and made it virtually useless. I intend to ask for a refund or a replacement.
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS IS NOT THE SAME SBM-200 AS OF MARCH,"If you have tried one of these at your local dept store as I did [...] you hit the demo button and felt the back do it's thing and you also felt the seat motors kick in, vibrating and pulsating. Well guess what HoMedics has decided, due to cost and the ability to build more of them for the high demand and more profit, to delete the seat motors. The problem is they kept the same Model # SBM-200 and the same price!So if you want the original that does it all you better call around and make sure you get one of the older models with the hand control that has a body silouette on it with controls for the seat motors. The new model has only 4 buttons and no seat motors.Don't get me wrong I love my older model SBM-200 for its stimulating massages, that's after I returned one of the new models that did nothing but go up and down the back. The seat vibrating function adds alot to it!!!"
4,Well Worth It,"If you want to spend the best $80 of your life, buy this wonderful contraption! It provides just enough pressure to feel good and it's neither wimpy nor too strong on your back. You'll save so much money on spa appointments once you own this wonderful chair!"
4,Homedics Back Massager,"After a months use, I find it to be a generally a good product. It does what it's supposed to do. Only possible negative, the drive mechanism seems to be a bit light. Plastic gears and such. And could be easily damaged. But if you are careful and don't over stress them too much they are fine."
4,HoMedics SBM-200 Massaging Cushion,"The cushion is nice at working out knots in muscles on either side of the spine because of it's kneading motion. Unfortunately, the rollers stop just below the shoulder blades so the massage is disappointing when the rollers don't continue up to the base of the neck. Overall, I do look forward to sitting on the cushion after a long day to just relax and enjoy a treat."
4,"NIce, simple massager",It's no $100 massage at the local spa but when it hits those knots in the lower back it makes it all worthwhile.
1,Not worth the money,"I was so excited when I purchased this thinking that finally I could get some relief for occasional back pain on my own at home; the problem with this product is that the metal bars inside of it that roll up and down your spine HURT like crazy! It is very uncomfortable. I found myself squirming in my seat from discomfort and pain as the bars rolled up and down my spine. It's rather large and bulky too and it's the kind of product that will eventually end up somewhere in the back of your closet because you will tire of having to drag it out of the box, find a place where you can sit and plug it in, etc, trust me! I ultimately got a refund on the one I purchased."
1,DOA,"I plugged it in... it didn't even work. I thought I had to do something special. I read the instructions, it says after I remove the screw on the back just plug it in... so thats what I did and tried turning it on but the control wouldnt respond."
1,Shiatsu SBM-200 Massaging Cussion,"I have had trouble with my back for years. My friend has a massage chair that was $3000.00. Other than not having the leg message, this is every bit as good for a lot less money. I would recommend this item to anyone. I am more than pleased with mine."
2,Chair hog,"Pros: Does a fairly good job of massaging the areas of your back on the massager plane of travel in the shiatsu mode.Cons: Vibrating seat. Cords and cables all over the place get caught under chair wheels. When not in use, it is uncomfortable and once it loses its initial charm, it gets taken out of the chair and used to collect dust. Made it China so if it breaks it becomes one more imported piece of poorly made outsourced junk."
2,not good after 1 month,"This was great for our office, everyone loved it until it started making farting noises so we haven't used it for about 8 months. I need to return it."
4,have not found a chiar that this device would fit on yet,best massage cusion I have owned but it does not fit any of my chairs...
2,Worked For A While,"Worked fine for about a week. Whatever it is that's rotating inside, started to slip in place, making an awful squeeling sound whenever medium-heavy pressure was applied. Returned for a full refund."
4,nice,This massager works well. It relieves minor back aches. Only drawback is that you want to keep using it and never get up.
3,I love it but problems,"I got this for Christmas last year . It helps our sore backs from moving and working. My husband and I were using it a few times a week and loved it . last week I noticed it would not start and I checked all connections.All were fine But no response from Shiatsu , As I was removing it from the chair it started I thought great. I used it then came back later and no start again. It seems to come and go. I have no idea what the problem is probably a loose connection internal. But I am discouraged about the product. It was a gift so I can't return it. So my option is to contact the company about it."
2,basic,It doesnt go all the way up or all the way down your back. After the first week we noticed that if you lean back on it normally it will make a strange grinding sound as if there is too much weight on it. Otherwise it is ok. I would not recommend it.
5,bought another one for work!,"I originally bought this for my husband for a Fathers Day gift. Then I tried it and liked it soooooo much that I had to go online and buy another one! I'm using it right now, you've got to try this! But beware... it is addicting."
5,Shiatsu Massaging Cushion,"After a strenuous Thanksgiving I was left with a very sore gluteous maximus. I ordered the Shiatsu massaging cushion which arrived yesterday. I've used it a couple of times now with wonderous results. My sore back is almost entirely pain free after a week or suffering. I highly recommend this unit for other suffering, over-worked folks."
2,good until it just stopped working...,this item broke down after 6-8 months...was pretty good but after it broke...it wasnt worth the investment..even though the warranty is good..and homedics will guarantee you a replacement but for me it was too much to hassle because i would have to pay for shipping and wait time. mind as well buy a new one
1,Shiatsu Massager,"I bought this item for my husband, but I also tried it. I found it hurt on certain areas on my back & it doesn't go up high enough for me. My husband used it for several days. The first few days he liked it, but then it started to hurt him in certain spots as well. Instead of soothing & relaxing, it caused minor pain, but enough to return it."
3,Feels good but SORE AFTERWARDS,"I spent an hour sitting in the chair with this massage cushion...getting up after half hour..then sitting back in it..It did feel like someone was massaging my back..however..I hardly felt any lower back massaging..and the upper back massaging seemed to massage my shoulder blades instead..and that hurt!...when the massaging steel balls were midback it was heavenly...but further up the back it seems like the balls are too spaced apart and therefore get to massage bone!@...not good!!...after getting up from the chair, I felt I that I needed to now go to the chiropractor!...I was achy near my shoulder blades...ouch.. other than that bruising (and I have extra padding!) I enjoyed some of areas of massage...but would not consider that for $99.00 It hits s sore spot!...oh and you cant adjust the intensity on the contol pad.. only manually by putting a towel between the chair and your back."
2,Torture cushion,"Ouch! only on and off options no levels to adjust the speed of the whirling plastic digging discs as they bruise and dig into our backs. Pain is not relaxing.This was purchased for my husband as a Christmas present- he saw one and tried it out in the store and really liked it. I copied down the model number and then shopped for it.The one we tried had a massaging seat/leg- this one we bought does not. Also, heat would be nice."
2,Homedics SBM-200 Shiatsu Masssaging Cushion,I received the Homedics SBM-200 Massaging Cushion for Christmas from my children. I was hoping to get some relief from lower back problems. The Homedics cushion is pretty intense and can leave your back very sore after using. It actually hurts in certain areas of your back.I would not recommend this product because it is too rough on your back. I was very disappointed.
2,Beware of this product - USE WITH CAUTION !!!!,"The instructions for this product state you must not use it for more than 15 min. intervals. What they don't insist is that you also shouldn't wear less than 2 layers of clothing and you should never use this product if you are easily bruised or taking medication that can cause you to be easily bruised. I returned my purchase because it was too strong a mechanism for me and for my younger brother who is healthy and height/weight proportionate. He stated it actually ""felt as if it burned him"". We reported it to the manufacturer and were dissatisfied w/ the replacement product as well - so don't feel it was defective; just not for us. I wonder if it is why it is typically displayed in the winter months when people have on coats & jackets while shopping/recieving the demonstration massages?!!!!! Be forewarned."
3,Smells bad,"This product delivers a good massage to the back, however, there is a very strong petroleum like odor in the fabric. When using this product we had to cover the chair with an old blanket, change into old clothing and store the massager in our garage. After a couple of uses our family decided the hassle wasn't worth the benefit!"
5,Feels amazing! Well worth the price!,"I purchased this for my new husband as a wedding gift. He's an illustrator who sits over a drawing board all day long and he always has the worst knots in his back. He was getting a Swedish massage on a regular basis but with his busy schedule, it was hard finding time to go. Now he can get a massage anytime he likes since this cushion fits right on the chair at his computer desk! He absolutely loves it! I use it for the knots I get by my shoulder blades and it does a good job of breaking those up. It does leave you a little sore afterwards (I noticed this more than my husband) but it's worth it. You won't regret this purchase - it really is as good as everyone says!"
5,AWESOME!,"I'm one of these pathetic, whiney ""pleeeaaaassseee just rub my back for one little second"" people. My back muscles are always sore,tense and in knots. It gets so bad that after a 2-6hr car ride I can hardly move my neck left or right. Anyway, this thing has taken me from pitiful to ecstatic. Every night I come home from work and let it massage my back. Also, if I scoot down far enough I can get it to massage my neck and the base of my skull. Every one who tries it at my house has to go buy one. It does have a strong plastic smell, enough to smell my whole living room up but after 1 month, it's going away and it's been worth it! It's holding up really well though I lean against it pretty hard as it says not to do, the balls can only take so much pressure and your not supposed to lay on it on the floor. My recommendation is to get this massager if you like a good, DEEP, upright back massage all the time."
4,Those balls really work!,"I am the huge fan for massage and I own more than 10 different massagers inclding two massage chairs cost me $$$. It is the best one I can find for this price and did provide some deep relaxing massage, not just some dizzy vibrating. I use it in my office, and everyone in my office loves it."
3,Not bad for being a machine.,"I received this as a gift from my boyfriend (I suppose he's trying to get out of giving me back rubs??). It's alright... it feels good when it's not digging into my shoulder blades. Generally, the spots on my back that need the most attention are my shoulders/neck and my lower back, which this massager cannot seem to reach. If I slouch as low into the seat as I possibly can, it can somewhat reach my shoulders. It's an alright product, but it's definitely not going to stop me from seeing my (human) massage therapist."
5,Great product,"Those who think the shiatsu massage cushion is too hard, has probably never experienced a shiatsu massage before. It does what it says. This product, if used as advised (only use on upright chair which does not recline), will provide the user many, many hours of relaxing, quality massage. It actually reduces stress on the back by kneading out knots. This product compared to a professional massage, pays for itself from the very first use. Highly recommended."
2,not for little/skinny people!,"I bought one of these about two years ago because I have chronic back pain, and usually have many knots in my back. I tried using this, and it hurt like crazy. Two reasons: one is I don't think it makes sense to sit upright for a back massage, and two is because the rollers/balls are very hard.I am a small person--105 pounds--and kind of bony. I tried using it with towels on my back, with my winter coat on, etc, and that helped a little, but not enough for me to keep using it. I would wince and couldn't lean all the way against the cushion. Not being able to relax against the cushion made it plain to me that this would not help me.That said, I ended up giving it to my boyfriend (who is a normal sized person), and he thought it was fine. I ended up trying another Homedics product (not listed on Amazon), which has quad rollers that can either roll or shiatsu, and that one worked better, but, again, it's sort of weird to sit up for a back massage."
4,Relaxing,This tape helps me to relax any time of day. Though it is not recommended to sleep by I find that I can relax and listen to both programs before settling down at night. I do prefer program 2 the better of the two. Thank you Beege
4,This is good,Janet Decker's voice relaxes you to the point where you are open to all that follows. Her suggestions stick with you throughout the day and influence the way you react to the day's events.
3,Disappointing and impractical...,"I guess I'll be the voice of dissent here, since everybody else apparently LOVED this book and its projects. I thought there weren't enough easy, do-able projects and some (the percolator/urn lamp, popsicle-stick purse, etc) were just plain weird. And where's the irony Craftster is known for?PLEASE - don't get me wrong! I love kitsch, and I love Craftster! And there is so much fun and practical kitsch floating around on Craftster, I guess I just figured this would be a ""best of""... to me, this just seemed like a collection of projects that are better off left in the past.What I'd love to see from Kramer would be a ""best of Craftster"" - that would be fabulous! In the meantime, pass on this book and go for one of the other fine collections of vintage-type crafts already out there."
5,This craft book is the one!,"I just got this book from my uncle for my birthday, and It is the best one I've seen. It has fun, clever writing and great projects- things i actually want and things my friends would want as gifts. The book is filled with clever ideas that are not difficult and well explained. I reccommend wholeheartedly! Buy it now, and go join craftster at craftster.org!"
1,Extremely disappointing,"The fact of the matter is that the quality of this recording is poor, and the instrument(s) were not tuned properly on all keys, and there were mis-notes, and there were off-tempo stanzas in the passages. Extremely disappointing. Not a CD one would wish to keep. Hard to understand from DG."
4,Read book FIRST,"Read the book FIRST;think it is confusing if you have not. Loved the actors it in. Not ""hollywood"" types but real looking people. Loved the ""plot""."
2,Superficial Chick Flick,"Superficial, overheated romance with no discernible storyline that begins with great promise. At first it was worth watching for the scenic New Zealand locales and the handsome male lead, but after the first 20 minutes it was a predictable yawn."
4,A Love Story,"The story is our typical, boy meets girl - boy looses girl but there is a twist. I enjoyed to movie..."
4,Twists of real life,All the ingredients for a very good movie without the Hollywood overkill. No big name stars but outstanding acting. Superbly intertwined the characters' lives from their first meeting to the end of life without being predictable or implausible. Very much worth the two hours of viewing time. The magnificent and breath taking beauty of New Zealand is an added bonus to the viewer.
5,One of the best movies of the last few years,"Saw this movie tonight at The Contra Costa Jewish Film Festival. The audience of about 850 people sat there spellbound after the ending. See no point in making a long review, as you will never see it here in the USA. For anyone else in Europe, it should be essential viewing. Just great!"
4,A sleeper,"A portrayal of post WW II damage to psyche, and on going relationships changing with time, and reverting back with aging."
5,Nothing Less Than Five Stars...,Beautifully woven story. Full of belivable experience and emotion. A beautiful muliti cultural experience that celebrates life as life has been lived. Take a couple of hours to experience a beautifully woven movie...
4,Bride Flight,This is a touching and twisted movie. I was a little scared at first when I realized it was all in another language but the subtitles are run through the movie slowly that it is very easy to read and follow the movie without having to replay the scene.
4,An interesting look into cultures.,"I can't say that this work by Liz Williams held me riveted, and I have to admit that I occasionally felt it to be a bit stiff and uncomfortable - it was, however, true to the tone of the book overall. The clash between cultures wasn't comfortable, so perhaps, neither was the reading of it."
2,Forced cultural appropriateness,"I certainly hope her other books are better since I bought them on a recommendation from others and the Amazon site. I considered it to be an interesting book with a novel idea that sufferred due to its seemingly forced nature and moderately boring presentation. It reminds me of too many books trying to make a point or present an idea that simply do not draw the reader in, at least not this reader. Many things relating to the culture seem to have been left out and a dreariness, one exceedingly ponderous, weighted it all down."
1,This video has been edited!!!,"Very disappointed! This video has been edited to qualify for a PG rating. I noticed at least 2 incidents of bad dubbing for language, plus a key sequence at the end was completely omitted. After watching this version, did you wonder why Peter Coyote's character quit shooting at the helicopter??? Well, that's because in the ORIGINAL version, he came to a bloody end. This version has that sequence edited out completely, leaving you wondering what happened to his character. I REALLY hate edited movies - Ted Turner, are you listening?"
4,Great Movie !!!,"I've had the internet for almost 4 years and I've been searching for this movie on V.H.S. or D.V.D. and here it is, finally !!! Fred Ward is a good actor and I wish he was more known then he is. He plays the part of a dirt bike racer. On his racing circuit, he gets lost somewhere in the desert and accidentally gets transported back in time, to the late 1800's. A research group was conducting a time travel experiment and for reasons of safety and secrecy, they set up the time travel machine out in the middle of the desert, hundreds of miles from the nearest person. Not knowing what it is, Fred Ward goes over to it on his dirt bike and the moment he pulls up to it, the research group activates it and he gets thrown back in time, about 100 years. I won't tell you the rest, but it's pretty cool and there are some funny moments during the movie as well. Thank God it's being transferred to D.V.D. !!!"
5,Nesmith in the zone!,"I was 13 when i fist saw this and i loved it. I can not review this film based on it's place as compared to other films. For this my mind is stuck at 13 and I love it just as much as the day I first saw it. Time travel, the bike, the red outfit, the glow sticks, El Diablo, Fred Ward, Peter Coyote, The old west, even the paradox of creating ones own existence. I love it all. I still get the urge to ride my old dirt bike every time I watch this.The soundtrack is cool too. Classic Nesmith!It was seeing 3:10 to Yuma that made me want to see this again. I love it."
1,Irritated,The 1 star review is for the DVD....They unbelievably cut a scene out from the climax of the film/ this must be a print from the cut for tv version. When I purchased it I immediately jumped to the cool ending with the good music and one scene was cut out rather awkwardly and obviously. Needless to say a pair of bloodied shredded boots should have been shown plus a screaming peter coyote. I'm complaining to anchor bay! I just want to know what happened? I haven't seen the rest of the dvd yet cuz I'm so peeved.
2,"You got it, dude.","Alan Satterfield writes, ""it always made me think that maybe he had slept with his grandmother....""Yup, that's the point. You will also note that his last name is Swann, and hers is Cygne (French for Swan). And he tells her that he's from Los Angeles, and later notes that his Grandmother came to Los Angeles looking for her lover.Fun film. Totally ruined by the changed ending. Buy the VHS version instead (although some of these have the bad ending as well.)"
3,QUESTIONING THE COMMENTARY,"Did this film merit one? Not really! Jaws got no audio commentary. Why should this flick? Few saw Timerider (at least in the USA) in it's theatrical release. Perhaps it became a hit on cable in late 1983. The dialogue is often silly (""She don't shoot no Dorset! Nobody shoots no dorset"") but at least there are no bleeding heart characters in the film and it's mostly a lot of fun."
3,shower chair,very solid but also very heavy. folding & unfolding chair is difficultespecially for the handicapped.
4,we are very pleased,my wife has trouble standing for long periods of time. This seat works wonderfully in the shower for her to take breaks while washing off. We are very pleased with how light weight it is and still very sturdy.
3,Float this boat!,"Floaters were a Gamble/Huff Philly Soul style group at the peak of Neo-Renaissance in 1977. They had one of the oddest hits ever with ""Float On"".Imagine a perfect stringed. soulful wail, the intro to what turns down lights, kicks off shoes, pours another drink...and then as soon as things get hmmmmhere comes..""Aquarious Leo Libra Cancer"" ""Ralph Charles Paul Larry""They know how to set the scene, the mood, after the disco and set with an opened bottle of champagne in the fridge, a couple of bottles of Old English 800, and if lucky a last gasp of A&J; Brandy.Ralph and Charles and Paul butter wouldn't melt their mouth so cool they are..Larry is just plain weird!But by that time, her nylons are tossed aside andhmmm Float on!Truly why we fall in love!(the rest of the CD... not so much)"
5,leo rules!!!,"i own this gorgeous lion, it turned my boring dining room into something SPECTACULAR! I also saw this same lion on an episode of CRIBS on MTV! So i assuming celebrities enjoy it as well."
1,Dont get it,"A box set was 20 or more shows, not 11. I like the show and read all the books up to 540 and then some. Shows great at times little diffirent but I really do enjoy a good saga. But pay for only 11 shows. No... I just watch it free on hulu just read books, untill box sets inprove!"
3,Prices too high,The box sets used to go on sale for $16-20... now they are asking $49?!?!... plus they practically halved the number of episodes per boxed set even though we are paying more money per each set. Disappointed with both amazon and Viz. Going to spend my money elsewhere.
3,Definitely a console game,"This game was definitely designed with the Xbox 360 in mind. I've played it on both the 360 and my pc and the 360 had a much more intuitive control scheme, but still a fun game. 7/10 stars."
4,Quircky fun,"This game is a lot of fun to play. You are the master of a bunch of disobedient imps. I was not challenged by this game, so if you are in the mood for a challenge than this is not for you, but if you want to have fun and actually laugh during a gaming session than this is great.There are some puzzles that you have to guide your minions through.It uses the way point system, much like Diablo 2, for saving progress. I cannot find a penalty for death. The controls are simple and work fine.The only un-positive thing i can say is that the graphics are not awe inspiring (I have a great graphics card). For example, your legs and feet move at a different speed than the ground, and minor things like that."
4,Evil has never been so much fun.,"This game is a great spoof off of any fantasy game/movie. The first level puts you right into a nice mid evil village that is rustic and beautiful and you send your minions to pillage and plunder it, it's very funny in that respect. It also has a lot of fun game play and a few types of minions so you can really strategize your method of combat. The levels are always changing so you never get sick of looking at the same scene over and over again. If you play it make sure though you buy all of the expansion packs with it because they play into the storyline and don't add onto the end of the story. But raising hell also added in a lot more game play in my own opinion. This game is definantly worth picking up."
2,"Fun at first, then the clunky interface gets boring","This is a fun game to begin with. You run around finding 'minions' who do your bidding out in the world while your character stands around pointing. But then...things start to get annoying.1) You cannot save your progress. There is an 'autosave' function. It only works when you leave a mission. And when you return...you have to replay the WHOLE THING. Just boring and feels like a waste of time.2) Your minions are hard to move about. Yes they're fun as an idea. But the only way to move them is by moving your mouse. They end up all over the place. Clearly this was designed for game controllers and then 'adapted' to PC, and the irritation just keeps accumulating.So, yes, it is fun for a while, and then it just gets annoying. I would not buy it again."
4,Overlord PC,I really like the game. I bought it to see if I'd like it before spending $50 on one of the new ones for a different system. I would definitely buy the latest games.I had some trouble learning the controls. They aren't the easiest to use and take some getting used to. The most difficult part of it is controlling your minions.The graphics are fine and I have had no other problems so far.
2,TRANSLATION ERROR,"The actual documents of Vatican Council II are required reading for anyone who wants to know what the Catholic Church really teaches. This translation is suspect however. In paragraph 25 of the Dogmatic Constitution Of The Church, Lumen Gentium, the translation here is: ""when he (the pope) proclaims by an absolute decision a doctrine ....."". The Latin text has ""definitivo actu"" which is clearly translated (by anyone who knows even pig latin) ""by a definitive act."" This loose translation is highly significant for the document goes on to say that doctrines so defined, by a definitive act (definitivo actu), are ""rightly said to be irreformable."" This egregious error makes the whole translation highly suspect.This error has been used by liberals who contend that the ordination of women to the prieshood is still open. IT IS NOT!I recommend the Sixteen Documents of Vatican II by Pauline Books & Media, also available from Amazon."
5,Great Product and Service!,"If you have a dog with skin problems, try this shampoo. It cleans well and leaves their coat smelling great. It was mailed out fast and was in great condition. You have a return customer in me, Thanks!"
3,Basic business,"This book is great for anyone who does not have any idea about starting a surplus products business. But for those who are looking for something truly insightful and meaty you will be dissappointed. The practice of ""Buy Low, Sell High"" are covered well but not much more. The editing and grammar are some of the worst I have ever seen for a professionally published book. It would fail a 9th grade english class. Overall I was dissapointed with the book. It didn't nearly satisfy my need for more in-depth information."
1,Please don't waste your money on this,"Starts with a very negative opinion of Day Trading. It's roughly 80 pages of large type with a 1 or 2 page blurb on a ""system"" like gaps, RSI, divergence, etc. The back is full of ad's for other recommended material. Hard to find a worse book."
2,Weak methods,"Not even sure that I can recommend this to a beginner, as these methods are very simple, very vague and often have no money management. The only positive is that it's a quick read and cheap."
4,Worth the money,"The book starts out with a word of caution, which is almost a refreshing break from the hype that has risen up around day trading. For those of us who have been trading for years, these words ring true. If you want the ""holy grail"" watch an informercial, if you want some ideas for trading, buy this book."
3,Great topic but missing something,"Newman starts with a great topic. Downward mobility is a subject that not only isn't discussed in our society, most people try not to even think about it. Newman gives some very moving accounts of downwardly mobile workers and their families; however, these accounts are very inconsistent. With some of the accounts, I felt like there was almost too much information; however, with other accounts I felt like we barely got a taste of what their personal experience with downward mobility involved.Newman depicts 4 different groups of downwardly mobile people (middle managers, striking air tower contol workers, workers at a Singer Sewing Company factory and divorced midddle-class women). However, there's really enough information on each group to necessitate 4 individual books. This is great starting point to examine downward mobility, but the book ultimately leaves you wanting more."
1,Success in Chemistry? Not with this book.,"I agree with the last review. The title of this book was very promising yet once I began to use it I realized I would have anything but success with Chemistry. Over all, I found this book extremely confusing. I will exchange it as soon as I can."
3,Mixed review,"I like this book ( I downloaded it) because it has short sections. It is for someone who already knows about chemistry and needs a refresher course. the book is easy to read and they give u practice problems after every chapter. It was more manageable printing them out and reading a couple of chapters a day (Its like tricking ur mind, hey it's only 3-4 pages for a chapter, I can do this) you also don't cram to much in one sitting, which is somewhat a waste of time because u won't retain as much material.The cons of this book are the mistakes on the problems and answers. Don't waste your time on the post test because most of the answers are wrong. I didn't find too many in the pretest. Some chapters are better then others.All in all, I would recommend this book if u just need refresher"
4,The Red String,"Single mothers going to adopt, should watch this video. Its not really about couples adopting. But its interesting to hear the childrens' point of view on adoption."
3,good,"It was great for a single parent adopting from China, my only complaint is that I wish it had been more in depth and been longer (I believe it was only 30 minutes). This is a topic I'm very interested in so I am hungry for a lot of information and felt this fell a little short. I did love what I gained from it though, and I know I will watch it again."
3,Contemporary Zydeco at its Best!,I heard a cut off this CD in Amsterdam on the radio and found the CD here. It's well worth the money and a pretty good independent production. I also collect Austin-based music and this is so different I'm glad to have found it! Buy it!
2,All show,"This looks great, But the light is just not bright enough, not even close. I would want a magnification mirror to be able to SEE . Not as my girl friend says ""put make-up on for a dimly lit restaurant""."
2,Not too bright...,"I bought this mirror thinking it would help in the mornings putting on my make-up, etc. due to rapidly declining vision capacity. The light is just not bright enough in any of the settings. It's easier for me to just stand very close to my wall mirror."
1,1-touch darkness,"Who designs this stuff? Certainly not someone who actually uses it. It is marginal on the brightest setting. During close up use (which is why you would buy it), it goes dark if you bump it...very annoying. Also, the trim looks more like bright coppery brass, not gold. I'm returning it today. I can see why HoMedics discontinued distributing lights."
3,Almost...But not Quite,"I really like my Cassiopeia, save one thing: The cradle is horribly built! I have had my P/PC for less than a week and the cradle's connection to the device is already broken. The connection is similar to a laptop pc card's donggle. These things are notoriously cheap and break almost instantly.The cradle is broken to the point that I am having trouble sync-ing with my desktop.Other than that, the device is tre cool and is a keeper. Although, I am not sure if I am going to take it back based on the problem with the cradle. Hopefully, Casio will replace this cradle soon, as I can't imagine that I am the only person having this problem.As for it's strengths, the color is very impressive and the links to MS Outlook is excellent. Also, the recorded notes are great for those times when you can't whip out the stylus.All and all, if you are a gadget freak, then go ahead and get it. If not, bide your time for a couple of months and wait for Casio to work out the bugs."
5,This a very cool new toy!,"I forked over 600 dollars for one of these babies. Let me tell you, it was worth every penny. I love it. It is absolutely wonderful.The MP3 function is great and so is the voice recorder. I record my school assignments for the night and listen to it when I get home. The MP3 (although a little slow) is very cool because I was ready spend another 150$ for an MP3 player and since this doubles as one I saved myself some money.I am a high-school student but this handy gadget is extremely useful for a buisness person or almost anybody else. Although not as fast coming into the computer as some of its rivals, it is certainly worth 600$.It is a powerhouse with 32 megs of ram, enough room to put many applications on. If that is not enough memory, you can additionally buy cards with up to 64 more megs of memory.This is the best PDA on the market right now. If you are looking for anything in this market, buy this organizer."
3,Almost Great,"This product had great potential, but there just aren't enough programs that work through Windows CE and 98 seamlessly. Casio has made a device that is lightning fast and has an amazing display (131 MHz and over 65,000 colors). The only real qualm I have with this machine, other than the software problems, is the battery. If you leave it off for a few days the battery is wasted and your memory is completely erased (I had the same problem a few years ago with a first generation Nino). When Microsoft gets its act together and makes their CE software more reliable they will have the Palm-PC market cornered and devices like these will be worth while."
5,I love this gadget!,"I've been using my E-115 for a week and love it. It is so much more useful than a Palm Pilot that there is no comparison. In particular, the transcriber software that lets you enter text by writing naturally is amazing. I never could get used to the palm grafitti language. The audio capabilities are also great. I've been commuting listening to MP3s and the New York Times downloaded from audible.com.This thing finally makes the concept of a hand held PC work. And thank you Amazon for getting it to me so fast."
2,ugh.......,"oh boy....did I EVER have high hopes for this litttle box....sadly as much as I wanted to like it, I guess it just wasint meant to be, I mean dont get me wrong, the colors deffinetly cool and all, and it has more features than you can shake a stick at, I'm still hard pressed to say its more useful than a palm V. I guess the bottom line here is the cassio cassiopea e-115 is a great multimedia powerhouse, but in the long run it just isint practical enough....just my 2 cents"
4,This book is extremely handy for parents.,"I got this book for Xmas and just love it. I can look for sites for the children when I am off line as well! I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for all of the published links that weren't working anymore - but hey, we know how the internet is!"
5,Valuable both personally and professionally,"Until I read Language and the Pursuit of Happiness, I had only a passing knowledge of the importance of language and linguistic acts in life, work and relationships. Since my introduction to this way of looking at an activity that seems so simple, I recognize how significant the linguistic acts are to collaboration, building trust, and preserving and strengthening relationships with friends, family and colleagues.Chalmers Brothers compiled a thought-provoking and very useful guide to understanding and improving language skills. I have purchased multiple copies of the book for individuals whom I coach and for my own presentations on building trust in organizations; recipients have expressed deep appreciation for the content.I strongly recommend this book for leaders who want to enhance their professional effectiveness; I equally recommend it to individuals who simply want to understand and improve their own interactions."
5,Coaching,"This is an excellent resource for those contemplating a personal transformational journey. The author has a great way of explaining simple concepts in a profound and new ways, that pushes reader from 'knowing' to 'learning embodiment'. This book has been smartly designed for personal use as well as for use in group settings such as book club or group coaching session. Each chapter is followed by a quick summary and some guided exercises to really experience key learnings. If you are a coach starting out and looking for a transformational approach to personal change for yourself or your client, this is the book for you. I often recommend this book to my clients and chapter 7 of this book is very popular with many of my clients."
5,This Book Will Change How You Work,I use this book as one of the texts for the graduate level professional life and business coach training I do. So many rich concepts and so easy to implement. Viewing language as a generative process will change how you work. i also give my business relationship coaching clients assignments from this book. It is excellent for shifting perspectives and offering new approaches to communication that are powerful and effective.
2,Keep your cash in your pocket,"I totally agree with Kayla Green's October 31 review.I'll be generous by giving the book 2 stars for it's concept. I was looking for dark fantasy material beyond my fixation with vampires and werewolves, and I thought a book about modern dragons would be just what I wanted.I don't need to repeat what Ms Green said about the book, read her review, as she summarized my thoughts exactly.I'm just glad I bought it in paperback, so it wasn't that much of a loss. I recommend not to spend money on it. Just borrow it from the library; I've donated my copy already."
2,Campy?,"When I first saw this book in the store I started laughing. The title and description on the back made me think that this could be a bad, campy, fun book. Unfortunately it was more bad than anything else. While this book certainly had some fun moments it mostly was Dragon-porn."
4,They ate a lot of people...,"I found this story ok, but it reminded me a lot of the Saint of Dragons by Jason Hightman. The Saint of Dragons was a lot better too. Both books had the same idea: dragons living among us.I read this book in one weekend because I had nothing else to do. The story moved slowly in the beginning but picked up toward the middle. I didn't have a favorite character because none were that likeable. It is hard to really like a book if you don't have any characters that you enjoy or relate to.The dragons in The Dragon Delasangre ate at least 10 people, not including traveling time, while waiting for the papers, at home, and at the feast.I hope that when you read The Dragon Delasangre you find a character likeable."
2,dragons,"When I picked up this book I thought ""cool, something new and different"" Well, after about the first chapter, the book started to go downhill. The whole first half of the book is about having sex and hunting and killing humans. The dragon sex isn't even natural-in the book, they do it like humans, which doesn't really work. I forced my way through this, thinking ""it has to get better"" well, luckily, it did. The plot did pick up and I couldn't put it down. I would pick up the next book in the series to see if he stays with the action or if he goes back to the lets have sex and kill some humans afterwards."
1,Cool Idea - Bad Story,"If there was an option for no stars, I would have almost picked it. The only reason this story deserves at least a star is because I like the concept.But the execution of this story is boring, predicatable, and like a (bad) dragon furry fap fest. Now I know why it was $5.99 at Borders.Do yourself a favor, return this book, now, and get ""Kitty and the Midnight Hour"" instead. At least Kitty's funny."
1,Why do people read this?,"Read something else, I want to read a story that has real imagination, This is just about dragons eating people same dragons same lack of imagination by humans again."
3,Yip - Teaser,"Ed Edd n Eddy is stupid. And if you like stupid, than this is GREAT! We like stupid.My problem is the ""teaser"" thread through the reviews. When I got the DVD, I kept trying to figure out how to get to the ""rest"" of the shows. I mean, they could not REALLY ship a DVD with only 6 episodes on it, where I think 4 of the episodes are short?!?!?! Sur'nuf - this is a Teaser, not a DVD collection. We were really disappointed and hope that we see full sets. But dont bother buying this - it is way short."
1,"ENOUGH WITH THESE TEASERS, GIVE US FULL SEASON BOXED SETS!!!!","Don't get me wrong, I love EEnE but I give this DVD one star! Why give us random episodes thrown together from different seasons? Why not release them to us by seasons?! These teasers just don't do the series justice! We need Season boxed sets!!!!"
3,DVD Episodes,"6 Episodes -If it Smells Like an Ed (2 parter)Take this Ed and Shove It (2 parter)One Size Fits EdA Case of EdHere's Mud in Your EdFool on the EdFrankly, I am disappointed. I admit it - I am an adult who for some reason likes this series. Ed, Edd and Eddy seems to do best when they bend reality - for example, ""Dawn of the Eds"", ""One Plus One Equals Ed"" and ""Cry Ed"" for example. If these ever came out on DVD, I'd be there to buy it!"
2,Ed Edd N Eddy vol 2,I am a huge fan of this series. This for the most part was a collection of the worst of the collection. Wait until they put a better collection togather.
2,Not For Beginners,"Contrary to the product description, the recorings are NOT slow and designed to simulate a child's learning process! They are normal speed, said twice and then they move on to the next one. Half the time you can't hear what they're saying well enough to mimic it. Also, it could have been organized a little better. I wanted to learn something simple like, ""Hello. My name is...may I speak with..."". But I never found it! I think 3 CD's are generous for under [$$$], but this is for people that already know Japanese and not for people that are just learning for the 1st time."
1,You're better off with a cheap phrasebook.,"This is a vocabulary list. That's all it is. It's not even a very good vocabulary list; it doesn't take time to explain the terms when the Japanese and English don't mean quite the same things. Maybe it gets better later on, I only got through the first hour, but so far it's essentially a guy reading out a dictionary. Utterly useless. If you tried to make conversation using this, you're going to make an idiot of yourself, assuming you can even manage to string together a sentence."
2,Kyocera HUGE peeler,I find this peeler is just too big. Because of its size it is difficult to find a good use for it. It also doesn't fit in the space where I keep my other peelers. I far perfer the smaller model.
2,not a tool,the idea maybe is good but in reality any pull metal peeler is much more practical and much cheaper then this fancy overprice no tool concept
1,Snake oil product. Avoid.,"I bought 1 year supply and this procerin foam is a pure waste of money. Stick on with Rogaine, Tricomin and other products. Avoid Procerin, does not do any good. Waste of money."
4,French food par excellence,"Peter visits the fetes of food throughout France - escargout, wine, cheese, etc., etc., etc. A plethora of flavors and smells in Mayle's wonderful style."
3,Disappointing: Is Mayle Running Out of Ideas?,"I have read every Mayle book and thus eagerly bought French Lessons with the hope that the downward trend of Mayle's efforts would be turned around. It was not, and it is getting worse. Mayle has been coasting on the extraordinary A Year in Provence for many years. He seems to have lost a good deal of his wit and cleverness in French Lessons. One gets the impression that he was pressed for another volume (which would certainly be a best seller irrespective of its merits due to Mayle's prior successes), had neither inspiration nor energy to maintain his prior efforts, and figured he might as well arrange for and then write about a few potentially enjoyable--and tax-deductible--excursions in France. He may have had fun, but the reader really doesn't receive his or her proper share of it. For a much better book of this genre, try Pasquale's Nose, Extra Virgin, or Driving Over Lemons."
3,Light and fun -- Mayle rebounds,"Since ""A Year in Provence"" is such a charming memoir I was prompted to read Mayle's subsequent works in the now Provence series. However, while amusing, the latter works pale in comparison with the jewel like quality of the original. Though entertaining ""Tourjours Provence"" was a disappointing ""sequel."" Last year after reading ""Encore Provence"" I felt that Mayle had squeezed out all the juice he could get from the ""Provencial"" rind. So, with trepidation and low expectations I bought ""French Lessons"" and was pleasantly surprised.While not nearly as clever or heart warming as his initial work, ""French Lessons"" is fun, entertaining, and will heighten your appetite. It is an ideal work for the Francophile, or simply the reader who wishes to travel vicariously to France. It is a perfect summer beach, or long plane ride book."
4,C&#65533;est genial,"""French Lessons"" is not Mayle's best book, but it is not one to be passed up, either. I recommend ""A Year in Provence"" and ""Tojour Provence"" for a better flavor of Mayle's love affair with France. For the art and fiction aficionado, ""Chasing Cezanne"" is quite a hoot. Peter Mayle has turned me into a Francophile with his wonderful books about everyday life in Provence. Mayle describes the French as wonderfully expressive people who are eager to share their knowledge and passion about food and everything else that may come up in conversation. I have a feeling that Mr. Mayle could find that positive reaction in people where ever he went in the world because his approach is curious, friendly, and whet with a tremendous appetite for life (as well as for alcohol, cheese, bread, etc.) Mr. Mayle gives me motivation to conquer my reclusive habits in order to better enjoy my stay in Provence some day on my way to Giverny."
3,Enjoyable but not as good as the Provence books,"I returned with hope to this latest book by Peter Mayle, since the previous ones have been about the best drive-time listening I've found. This book isn't quite up to the previous standard but is well worthwhile.Instead of life in Provence, this tome focuses on dining throughout France, covering areas from snails to frog's legs to truffles to the world-famous Michelin guide. Mayle isn't short on anecdotes, but the book reads a bit more like a collection of restaurant reviews, albeit very entertaining ones, than a memoir.Simon Jones was initially a jarring change from the voice of David Case that I had previously considered the voice of Peter Mayle. Jones lacks the precision of Case but has a folksy, conversational tone that Case's ""snooty, cruel voice"" lacks.As I said, still an enjoyable book but not quite the marvelous collection of stories and anecdotes that the Provence books are."
2,Only A Few Interesting Segments,"Having read several of Mayle's books with different levels of interest, this one ended my interest in reading others for quite some time.It's comprised of about dozen segments, of a few pages each, written primarily about unique food fairs or wine tastings across France. While the first two or three segments were interesting with some humorous aspects, the book became tiresome. After a time, it read as if written by a privileged, promoter whose profession as an author gave him a business write off by his special invitation to these events. The wine tasting was like many others and a closing segment about his going to a high end spa was not unique to France -- it read more like a promotion describing many high end spas which can be found in equally many places throughout the world.This is one book I regret having purchased."
5,"French Lessons: Adventures with Knife, Fork, and Corkscrew","Peter Mayle's eyes were opened on his first business trip as a young executive with his boss to Paris. He learned that French meals were events, and that French cooking was an art. He learned that food could be something more than those English meals, hastily eaten as a child.In this wonderful book, Mr. Mayle takes the reader to various food festivals throughout France. He takes us to the snail festival and to a celebration for the renowned Bourg-en-Bresse chicken. He takes us to the town where the frog is celebrated and to the festival for bouillabaisse. Finally, he mystifies the reader with details behind the precise workings of the famed Michelin Guide, the French guide to restaurants.Mayle is always humorous and descriptive, and this book is no exception. This book, like many he has written, is divided into short stories of his experiences. This book is highly enjoyable and entertaining."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Mayne is completely out of gas. This collection reads exactly like back of the magazine filler in an airline throwaway that only the desperate for any text would read. Mayne had one book in him, and he is clearly down to seeds and stems at this point. His publishers and editors also deserve blame for printing, at hardcover prices, less nothing. The colorful characters, surprising and humorous adventures, and local color are totally absent from this, probably the last Mayne for a long time unless he devotes himself to a total overhaul of style, substance, and subject matter. Save your money."
3,Few temples..incomplete portrayal,"Having just got back from Bangkok, I was disapointed to see only 2 minutes dedicated to the beautiful temples of Bangkok. I like the Lonely Planet guide books, but this video only visits one temple, but not the most beautiful Royal Palace (strangely the Lonely Planet website doesn't cover it either, check out frommers.com instead).The video spends more time showing Thai boxing and walking the red light district than showing you historical sites. The gorgeous beaches of Thailand aren't even visited. Unfortunately there aren't many Thailand videos to pick from."
4,Not for kids,I bought this book thanks to the good reviews. But I do not think this book is appropiate for kids.
1,awful software,"what a awful software it is! I spent an hour and couldn't make it work. btw, I am not newbie of computer."
4,Pen Scanner- Wizom SuperPen Transalator SP1000V,"I am pleased with this pen. The scanning works well as long as you don't try to scan too fast. I am hoping to use this Pen for a long time.The only drawback- software is prety bad. It took me a long time to get it working on my computer. Once i got it to connect and installed the dictionaries etc... it worked well. You will have to spend time installing the sofware, so be very patient and read all instructions carefully.Overall I'm very happy with this pen. I would give the pen itself 5 stars - but the software is so bad that i have to knock it back to 4."
3,easy to use,"on the cd rom, the languages for the dictionnary are not corresponding, but except the configuration for the first use it's a convenient item."
1,"Obsolete, and serial communication doesn't work","This may have been an advanced gadget in the year 2000, but right now it seems this company may not last another year.The software looks outdated, and it is also disfunctional. The serial-over-USB communication is outdated and malfunctioning in addition. And it will not work no matter what ""baud rate"" you try!!!There seems to be a newer version of the device (TS) with proper USB communication, however it lacks downloadable dictionaries."
3,Got it to Work Finally! Communications Problem Solved,"I had the same communication problem I found the solution on the web""Just got it working :) Make sure the plug is pushed in to the pen until you hear and feel a click (don't just rely on it looking all the way in, you really have to push it quite firmly). It now works on both XP and Vista. Hope this helps.""[...]"
2,Travel Kit,"Product is as represented but I didn't find it a useful as I thought I would. If you know what you want, this might be it."
2,A Real Yawner,"I must admit that I was a bit shocked to find the glowing reviews of this book after I tried to schlep through it. Frankly, this book was boring. I couldn't get much more than 1/3 of the way through it. I don't like books that deal with made up legends and make the heroine such a priss about ""preserving"" some kind of past. Rubbish. Read Scandal's Bride if you want decent treatment of the subject, at least."
4,"Excellent, touching story..(4 1/2 stars)","I absolutely LOVED this book...Mairey was an extremely likeable character and I have to say that Jack has made my list of all time favorite heroes. He was so unbearably sweet and open with his affection. It was such a pleasure watching him interact not only with Mairey , but with her little sisters as well. I have but one quibble with this book..it has to do with a part of the plot and an absolutely ridiculous decision that Mairey makes towards the end of the book...it is eventually resolved, but just the fact that she made such a choice( which I wont reveal because it would be entering spoiler territory)made me want to scream and hurl this book at the wall. Now..disregard that statement and RUN out to get this book...it is an absolute treasure!"
3,Ok but reader make me not like it as much,"Mairey (an antiquarian) is contracted by Lord to find the ""Willow Moon Knot"" which is to show the secrets of where lost silver can be found in England. But Mairey has taken a family pledge to not reveal the ware bouts of the silver, and hide the willow knot if it is found. Lord Jackson Rushford forces Mairey Faelyn to move onto his estate--where she sees that despite Jack's wealth and power, he guards his heart more strongly than any treasure. As they kiss in the moonlit woods, she knows that he is the one man she should never marry. When she falls in love with him and they get married what can she do about the family pledge and the silver and in doing so can she keep her heart in tact?I thoroughly enjoyed the book though I don't recommend this reader to anyone. I thought when she took on the voice of the main character she slowed it down to much and made her sound a little stupid. But, she was ok with the male voices."
2,Old and unkept,"The package was faded, dusty, and appeared to of been on the shelf for years. I question whether the product is still wholesome. The freshness and nutritional value is unknown."
5,Good soup TVP,"I used this for extra texture in both soups and stews, and it worked fine. A bit of careful use of seasoning and you would swear it is meat."
5,Good value for a healthy product,This is a good healthy substitute for protein and comes at a great price. The quality of the product was good and it arrived on time. Will buy again.
2,questionable product,"It did not taste good. The package label list: Protein :0 grams. If this is accurate then the product's name is misleading, or they are careless in writing the nutritional info. Regardless, it tastes like cardboard"
5,Great meat replacement,"Since the new year, I am on a lifestyle change. Use this to reduce overall fat in your diet. Warning: marinate the chunks at least overnight and cook the chunks for at least 30 minutes in a sauce of your choice and enjoy on pasta, rice, or salads."
5,good,"the book is very good, just like new, and the ship is very good, too, I got it only 7 days after paid."
2,If you run Mac OS 9 it might work out for you!,"Back in the old days of OS 9 for Mac, I used this printer to make posters and get somewhat accurate color proofs for 4 color commercial printing. I could get some really nice photo printouts with the gloss paper but in time the ink fades so you're better off sending your digital photos to a lab to be printed.I've had many problems with the automatic paper feed. I just gave up and manually put in one page at a time every time I wanted to print. When I upgraded to OSX the printer no longer worked because Epson does not have reliable updates for this printer! They suggested an update for OSX but it only worked for a short time. I finally gave up and bought an HP."
1,Prone to paper misfeeds,"I'm on my second one of these. First was prone to a lot of paper misfeeds. I had hoped that was an anomaly when I bought the second one. Not so. It does the same thing. A real annoyance...I have to go over to the printer and baby through each print. I've tried the Epson cleaner sheets, too. They don't work. Avoid this printer. PS - You will also need to buy a 3rd party Postscript RIP if you use Mac."
1,Don't let anyone give you one for free,"This is quite possibly the worst printer ever made in all printer history. The color is horrible, it jams the paper every other print, slow as mollasses, impossible to service, and just generally looks bad. The roller-arms are spaced so that they never take its own specially priced paper straight into the feeder. Ink Cleanings usually last for two prints on most minimal print settings, then degrade into splotchy lined garbage. Makes the most horrible noises when printing and death rattles when jammed or confused. Don't let anyone give you one even for free. and for heavan's sake, don't actually spend money on one. I have two, one for parts, and the other for parts backup, as both are equally on their way to a trash heap in South America where orphan childern can beat the living daylights from its horrible plastic casing. If negative stars were available for review, this product would deserve them."
3,pros vs cons,Pros:- Inkjet cartriges are big and last a long time.- Color is very nice just make sure you use good paper.- Paper takes large sizes and different thickness.Cons:- Not supported for Mac OS X!- No background prining allowed (u can't do anything while printing!)- Parallel port only means slow and need usb adapter with new mac.- Has problem grabing paper which means u need to sit and watch it do each print. This is one of the worst problems.- Error messages that u need to click ignore button. This gets old fast after 100 print out!
2,It'll eat you out of house and home,"At $79.99 a cartraidge, and 4 seperate color cartridges, large tabloid sized Epson brand paper at an avergae of $2 A SHEET (and poor - nasty- quality unless you use Epson paper) this printer will either make you look like a HUGE business or land you in the poorhouse.It does print nicely when we can get it to work right.wished we'd bought a HP large format or tektronix instead. Proabaly would have come out cheaper int the long run."
1,Cancel my current order,"I had a Epson Stylus 3000 several years ago. It developed streaks. I took it to Chicago, the only repair place in the area. I brought it home. There were still streaks. I took it back, brought it home and again there were streaks. Your recommended repair man was a good talker and a lousy technician.I gave the printer to Hamilton Tech in Davenport. I tried to order a new one but could not find the check-out button. Please cancel my order. I will not take a chance on another old printer. Erwin Weber, Rock Island, IL 61201."
3,The Emperor's Clothes,"What has been glorified as a premium graphics printer -- isn't. This printer is old technology in a new box. And, I wound up having to BUY their latest RIP software ($158) to get it to run w/ Windows 2000. But worst of all was Epson's customer service. I had over 22 contacts w/ them in three months and, in the end, they were unwilling to take the machine back.During those three months, the printer's lack of performance was blamed on a variety of things. Me - ""it's a complicated machine, you are probably are doing something wrong."" The paper - ""Epson only guarentees print quality on Epson paper."" My software - ""Your software may not be able to produce files that are good enough.""I will NEVER buy another Epson printer, mostly because of what I have been through with their customer service."
5,Epson 3000 great for printing engineering logs,"This printer is the absolute best available for one thing: printing continuous feed logs with tractor feed paper. In fact, the only two decent printers for doing inkjet printing on continuous feed paper are the Epson Stylus Color 1520 and 3000.They both work with external Jet Direct for networking.Many ""log printing"" programs such as Lexco Lexview, Seelog Viewer, Atlas Metafile Viewer, and PDS Viewer, require either Epson or HP. If you don't want to spend thousands on an HP plotter, then Epson 1520 or 3000 is the only way to go.Don't even think of using the Epson Stylus Photo R2400. WILL NOT NETWORK!"
2,Too much whining!!,"This could have been a good book, but Ms. LaRoche never lets up on comparing todays lifestyle to that of her grandmother - a useless endeavour. She obviously avails herself of all the modern conveniences - like voice mail, TV, fast food, etc but complains incessantly about the present way of life. The book assumes if we enjoy updated technology or spend a few hours watching sitcoms, that we have lost touch with our families, values etc. Ms.LaRoche is sometimes amusing however she offers little realistic advice."
1,Piece of junk,"Worked great, but only for a short while. Company replaced it but that one failed also. If you hit the reset button the display goes blank - and that's it, it's done. I don't think they make this model anymore. Spoke personally with an Accusplit rep at a conference I attended and he was ""surprised"". Had me send the unit back to him so they could figure it out. After 4 months they sent a really cheap replacement. Find another mfg."
4,Candy was on everybody's mind,Watching this video recently brought back some very familiar images. Seeing Richard Burton reciting corny poetry was a real trip. Even Marlon Brando appeared very youthful in this movie.Whatever became of Ewa Aulin???See the trailer at IMDB.COM viewable with Windows Media Player 7.1..
1,"So many big names, such a terrible movie","Speaking as someone who was a mere twinkle in his father's eye in the 60s, I have no fond memories which this movie rekindles. I presume it is supposed to be campy fun, but it's a pretty terrible movie from start to finish. Big names, bad script, bad acting, bad music. This movie has everything."
5,It's about time!,"I first saw this film about 20 years ago on some pay channel, and have been waiting to see it again ever since. Okay, so it is far from the best film ever made, but does that always matter? Not to me. This is simply a fun movie. Overloaded with an amazing 'who's who' cast, a gorgeous heroine and an outstanding soundtrack (which I searched for at record shows and finally found) this film is the 60's incarnate. A silly, sexy, swinging good time. The limited edition DVD comes in a cool tin case and has a set of cards with comments and rememberances from most of the major cast members. It's a treat!"
1,piece of trash,"This dvd does not work, the seller only accepted to refund me the half of the price without shipping, so at the end i paid almost 50 dlls for a piece of crap. The dvd is damaged or simply has nothing recorded on it. Bad from amazon, in this time did not take the client best interest."
3,You had to be there...,"It was '68: I was 18: this movie was stunning and bright. It's 2001: I'm 49: this movie is embarrassingly naive. Some things are best left in the imagination I think. I would have been happier with my memories of the times and the thrill this movie brought than the reality of how laughable it is. God, it makes you feel old..."
3,Goodnight bad guys...,"I'm a huge fan of the TPB's and I purchased this video to complete my collection which would be my suggestion to anyone considering purchasing it. It's 47 minutes that feel twice as long and really drawn out. It just seems like the story never comes together on this video and everything is overshadowed by 45 minutes of drunk, loud and incomprehensible Jim Lahey. It's not a horrible video, just not one of their best."
4,Funny stuff.,"My husband and I thought this was funny but were a little disappointed that it was so short in length. That is my only complaint. We got what we expected, otherwise... lots of laughs!"
5,Very Fast!,"This is an awesome movie, its in great condition and it was delivered way faster than I expected it to!!!"
3,Say Good Bye and Good Night,"I've been a big fan of The Trailer Park Boys, I have all the Dvd's released to date, including ""Say Good Night To The Bad Guy's""In this release, I find that the acting is a little lack lustre, and the storyline is running thin and tiresome. Once again, it's Lahey against Ricky and Julian. Lahey's alcoholism is becoming more ridiculous than funny. It seems as though this episode has been rushed and is missing some chemistry.I gave it 3 stars out of 5, and I think that was too generous, all in all = crap."
2,Rip- Off,"I like trailor park boys. but this dvd is not worth 15 bucks its not not a movie at all, its more like 1 episode on a DVD its 47 min long and they leave you hanging for the ending. Total rip off!!!"
5,Beautiful,"I'm a Dawn Upshaw fan to begin with, so that part's easy. The recording is fine, the CD clean. The metadata is adequate when using in an iPhone or on computer to see the information & graphics."
5,Canteloube: Songs of the Auvergne Upshaw/Nagano,"We are very, very pleased with this recording. Dawn Upshaw's interpretation is more of a folk style and suits the music beautifully."
1,Big fan of Upshaw,But this is a downright terrible CD. I actually threw it away instead of giving it away. So sorry I took a chance on this one. Her voice sounds terrible to me.
4,Great Value,"I love my new Sony KV32S42 32"" TV. I think it is a great value for the price. I could have paid an extra $800 and got a 32"" WEGA, but I think this Sony 'S' series TV has everything I need. The picture is crystal clear and the sound is just great. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a decent TV at a good price."
3,32 inches of Medium Quality Sony,"This is a nice cheap 32"" TV, but as the old saying goes, ""you get what you pay for."" It is a very nice TV and gets the job done, but you will notice lower that normal resolution quality, and it is just not what you would expect from a Sony Tube."
1,FUZZY WUZZY WAS A TV...,"Ok, maybe this dosen't deserve 1 star, but that shows my anger. I bought a $600 dollar TV, and i have to say, for that price, and for a SONY product, i expected more. the picture was not a clear as i expected, and if you want a new ""superbowl"" TV like me, you can get a different one for less $."
4,Habanero History,"This book is great for the history of habaneros. I did not know there were so many varieties of habanero. However, there are only a few recipes I would try. My taste runs differently from those in the book."
3,Pitting of surface,"Although I carefully follow the directions for cleaning this product, I find that the finish is getting small surface pits. I have written to Armetale about this problem but have not as yet heard from them,"
4,Clinical and bright. Engages the mind.,"Inspector Abaline's shrewdness and insight are hidden within his ordinary persona, keeping the reader wondering about his techniques as he tackles this difficult case. The dangerous twists, turns and new developments continue until the very end of this intriguing story. A good read."
1,what a joke- an insult to hip hop,"Mr. Hyde is an insult to hip-hop and the english language. He is a degenerate wannabe rapper, who grunts out immature studio-thuggery about violence and gore that he has never seen. This music is total mental slavery and beyond painful for the ears. His rhymes are simplistic, hokey, and sweet jesus are they repetitive. Ooooh, you are gonna kill me with a sharp blade huh tough guy? How can people take this fool seriously?If this buster didn't grow up with Necro and Ill Bill he would be washing cars and serving Blizzards at the Dairy Queen. He is a complete parasite who leaches of the success of his more talented crew members. Avoid this like the avian flu."
1,ungh?,"For some strange reason, I would rather listen to Mr. Bungle. This is like Mr. Bungle minus the charm."
4,SICKNESS DOESNT GET SICKER THAN THIS,"First of all this cd is sick.Songs like On the Say my name , spill your blood ,the crazies metal version , knife in your spine, married whit pain will leave you whit back chillz.WARNING!THIS CD IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! If you have no problem listening to necro than this cd is for you but if your stricly into POP this is not for you. This cd is not for the weak hearted even in the booklet there pics of gore.This album is dead serious about death and gore and pure violence.Unlike necro albums were you sometimes get little giggles about his dark humour this album is pure raw uncensored gore knife in your spine spill your blood music. I recommend it to all psycho-logical fans out there. Add this one to your collection. Peace"
4,Sick Hip Hop,Yo this CD is tight from the start to the end you feel the raw hardcore lyrics of Mr. Hyde and the tight beats from Necro. With a style like label owner Necro MR.HYDE rips tracks apart at the arms. A peferect first album look for this cat in the future. PSYCO-LOGICAL RECORDES ON THE RISE!!
4,It's a pistol grease gun...,"I'm not going to pretend that there's anything remarkable about this gun, but add a 6-inch or longer flexible extension and you may forget where you put the 2-handed ""gun"". Yes, it's more expensive to use than the larger tool, and there's not the variety of grease cylinders available for it, but it's so handy (and, uh, inexpensive) that you can afford to have several scattered around where you keep your machinery."
5,Very Helpful Book!,"This has been helpful in determining the value of Nancy Ann Storybook dolls. It only covers bisque dolls, doesn't have every version, but covers most of them."
5,Why is this wonderful book out of print ?,"This was only the second book specializing in Nancy Ann Storybook Dolls. This first one, by Marjorie Miller (now deceased) was a great attempt in black and white, but it was frustrating trying to identify the dolls because of its lack of color. At last a book was published identifying all the known bisque Nancy Ann dolls, their body types, back markings, boxes, and yearly costume changes. This is known today as the RED BOOK, and sells for outrageous prices.The second book about plastic dolls, bisque babies, and all the later Nancy Ann dolls, including those made by later owners of the company is now known as the BLUE BOOK. Both are wonderful, so get the blue book while it is still reasonably priced. By this time all the advanced collectors have it, but some sellers, and a few beginning collectors are woefully ignorant about Nancy Ann dolls and their imitators."
1,Your Monitor will have horizontal wavy lines!,"I read the review and saw more postive reviews than negative, but my experience with this product was negative! Wavy horizontal lines will appear on your monitor immediately once you connect to your monitor! Also, a pin was missing when I opened the product, but after reading about this and other products, a missing pin is the norm, not a defect, so don't worry."
1,Poorly manufactured,"The connector on thje end which secures into the monitor had no preformed screw holes to accomadate a jewlers screwdriver to secure it. Additionally, one computer would bleed off the monitor even when not turned on.decreasing the monitors resolution."
1,"Product works, but lost my shipment","Seller either lost or forgot to mail my purchase until three weeks after I purchased it. Issue was resolved, but needs to work on giving something back such as expediting the shipment once a mistake on their end is made."
3,Didn't work for good reasons.,"I bought this with one of the amazon gift cards I had. Coming in the mail very quickly I was happy. I connected this three different ways, from my tower, from my monitor, and from my laptop. This most likely did not work because i was connecting two hardrives together, my laptop and my tower. But after I unplugged everything and went back to my normal computer (H.P. Slimline 3500f) my monitors resolution was very messed up. It's resolution was 1600 x 1200 which does not fit mine because it is 1440 x 900. Some tweaking and it was fixed. But the bottom line this product did not work so I gave it three stars."
4,"Great, but the '62 band/DVD is better","This is a great quality DVD.The band is not as swingy as the band that you can catch on the ""Count Basie: Live In '62"" though and I did not find it nearly as enjoyable. It does not seem like the ""real"" Basie Band. Butch Miles is more intense then Sonny Payne and the band is sweating and not as relaxed as a result.Overall, the playing and song selections are not as bluesy or groovy and I was in no hurry to hear the DVD a second time - it just does not get me off like the '62 DVD. It is not nearly as special.My only true complaints are that I wish they did not insult the great Butch Miles by chopping out his solo on ""Whirly Bird"". I would have rather they chopped out the introductory comments."
3,Great Band - Shabbily produced DVD,"Have had this on Vinyl for nearly 30 years so was looking forward to the DVD. What a disappointment! Sound is good but the film is dark. (Compare it to shots from this concert on Youtube) ""Jumping at the Woodside"" is missing and one of the tracks stops and fades halfway thru then starts again a few seconds later.""Fantail"" is actually ""Whirlybird"".Less ""waffling"" by Mr.Granz and less credits at the start may have permitted ""Woodside"" to be included.A great band and concert let down by a shoddy DVD presentation"
3,Cradle not complete as pictured,"Beware if you are purchasing this for a Fuji Finepix E550. In the picture the cradle is shown with the top plastic adapter you need to properly use this with a E550. When I recieved mine this piece was not included. It will still work, but it is not stable in the base."
3,Universal Cradle,"I was not satisfied with this item. I received the Universal Cradle, but the adapter was not included. The cradle is not much use without the adapter.Thank you."
2,"An early novel, misunderstandings misguided romance. Ho-hum","Although I am a raving Putney fan normally, this early novel was quite boring, I thought. Lovers are crossed by their own misunderstandings of their own feelings and their ""duty"" as they see it. In the end, the proper pairings result, but by that time, They seem so separately and equally witless that I had ceased to care."
2,NOT THE BEST,This is not the best of her books.The characters kept changing partners and after a while I got disgusted. tired and struggled to finish the story.
4,Fantastic Paperback Soap Opera,"I used to be very fond of soap operas but they just don't make them like they used to. This was an awesome read. The romance is back and forth and across. I loved the drama. I loved even more that there were no cartoony villains to contend with. These are just people making mistakes and fixing them is hard. I enjoyed that Putney showed how a character could be in love with more than one person without being faithless. And the sweet moments between Antonia and Adam were sweeeet, especially when he gathers up his courage and fights for her. Please give Carousel of Hearts a chance!For those who care the language is clean and the bedroom door firmly shut."
4,Well crafted romance,"I enjoyed several things about this book: the clever construction which makes the characters revolve around each other without any of them being unlikable or doing stupid things, the author's confidence in depicting the Regency period, and the way that the eventual pairings are shown to be absolutely right. The central incident that throws the characters' lives into turmoil is handled in an interesting way, in that it helps Antonia to understand her cousin better.This book isn't as heart tugging as some of Putney's later full length Regency historicals, but it is very neatly written and entertaining. I love intelligent characters who can articulate their emotions. I found this a good read."
3,Read it at the beach,"The drama in this book was a little forced. Early chapters build up the surprisingly anti-climatic meeting of the shark and its first (known) fatal victim (like lovers running across a meadow, we see the victim riding to the beach by rail while our shark anti-hero is swept along to their rendevous by the Gulf Stream). The book does a nice job of painting the picture of the times, and the reader is left with a sense of understanding what happened in this bizarre story. Worth the read; particularly if you read it during a beach vacation, as I did."
4,Interesting book proving truth is stranger than fiction,"This book chronicles a spate of deadly shark attacks on the East Coast back in 1916. The attacks sparked such a panic that for a time the news of the killer shark pushed World War I off the front pages of US newspapers. The author does an admirable job of detailing the background of the area and the bloody events that left such an imprint on those who lived during the time. Once again, truth is stranger than fiction for who would have written a fictional book with a shark traveling up a creek and killing a young boy and man? This actually happened in 1916 wave of terror.Read and beware the water...."
3,It was okay....,This was more a history book about 1916. I would have liked to have had more details about the shark attacks.
3,"Being from the Jersey Shore , I had to read it.","Part biology lesson, part social study lesson, part local history lesson, part political history. Wow! That's alot in one book, especially when we're talking about just one shark. I have lived on the Jersey shore and spent a great deal of time at the beach. I could very easily visualize many scenes, and many of the towns mentioned I am quite familiar with. Would this book have more of an impact on those who are familiar with the area? Possibly.I enjoyed the fruits of exhaustive research on the period and the people. At times, I thought the book really strayed very far from the core. I'm not sure I really cared about some of the more politically oriented material or even who was the chief of Icthyology at the Museum of Natural History and how he got there? Seemed like ""filler"" to me.And about me? Well, I didn't go into the water before this book (thank you JAWS), and I don't plan on doing it in the future either."
3,alittle too historically based,A bit too involved in the time frame from when these attacks took place. Would like to have had a little more detail on the attacks themselves.
3,"Good, But I wanted a little more.","I enjoyed the book, as other reviews have mentioned, it is a good period piece about life on the Jersey shore in 1916. The author tried to touch a lot of bases and started but did not complete a lot of story lines. When I was finished, I found myself looking for another book about the events that would fill in some blanks."
3,"Sketchy, but a good read nonetheless!","This book discusses the terrifying attacks on swimmers that occurred of the coast of New Jersey in 1916. Although the book is an enjoyable read, the author is telling the story using his conclusions about how these events transpired. There are many other researchers that have viewed the same events as being carried out by other species of shark. The book tells the sory as if it is definitive that the attacker was a single great white shark, however this fact has never been substantiated. Regardless, read this book for a possible explanation of these horrible days in beach history."
2,Where is Reader's Digest When You Need it?,"There are one or two chapters in the first 200 pages of this book that are actually about the subject matter. Knowing this, the author, on multiple occasions, builds the story as though something of substance is about to happen. Nothing does. This cheap trick is performed several times throughout the book.If you can get past the flowery writing you may enjoy the last 100 pages. I suggest you get this one from the library. There are certainly better books to buy. If you already own it you can practice your skimming skills."
1,johnny come lately,"I just don't get it. I thought the novelesque style here would keep me riveted, but then I wanted to know what really happened in 1916. Even though this book is well written, I get the funny feeling it's not the real McKoy on this subject. Then I saw the NAtionl Geographic film and the Discvery channel film based on that other factual book on this same subject. Shame, Shame"
2,This book is a bore...,"I bought this book for my teenage son as a summer read. He threw out the book after reading 70 pages without coming to a shark attack. After this I started reading the book and was hugely disappointed. The author seems to have just cut-and-pasted a lot of 1916 era trivia from archives of local newspapers and then threw in a couple paragraphs about shark attacks to make the book sell. On the other hand, if you want to learn 1916 era trivia this is a good book."
5,Great Read,"This book takes a significant moment in American history and blends it with an excellent narrative that makes it hard to put down, easily rivaling 'Jaws' in it's intensity. Michael Capuzzo has brilliantly captured the mood of a more innocent time in history, where man was the master of his domain and feared nothing. And then came the shark...."
2,Shark book not a page turner,This book was slow and not interesting. I forced myself to finish it. I do not recommend buying it. It's not worth the money.
2,"Freaky squirrel..or animal, or something...","Doesn't being half an animal and half a squirrel make him freak enough? Why doesn't he just stick with that as his main attraction? And what's with the bag over his head? Is that supposed to hide his""Hidious"" features or something? He didn't look scary at all so why put a bag over his head in the first place? I liked the flipping action though. You can make it go backwards too, which is kinda fun. My sister hates it."
1,mostly filler,"You could distill this entire book into a magazine article. It contains page after page of common sense filler, like explaining the Golden Rule, and such insights as ""people like to communicate."" And many of its premises -- such as all brands needing an enemy or rival -- are not substantiated by all 9 of their handpicked examples! At least Jim Collins made sure of that in ""Good to Great"" (a much better book). This book is filled with sloppy scholarship and derivative thinking by two no-names in the business."
3,Meh...,"I only read this for a class. It was alright, hardly revolutionary in my mind. I liked how they showed real examples for each of their points however I felt like there was more filler than actual substance to the book. It was an easy read for a business book though. I think that someone without much of a marketing background would find it more beneficial than those who are educated within the field."
3,I don't see what all the hype was about....,"It's a good book. It's got some fun stories about certain ""cult brands"" but it's nothing ground breaking. Sure I picked up some nifty tidbits about how big companies have done some ""revolutionary"" things, but it really comes down to customer service and doing what's right rather than what could create the highest profit margin.I bought this book at the suggestion of Roy Williams (Wizard of Ads- GREAT books!), but it really just made me wonder if he's getting a kickback for the recommendation.It's an easy read. If you've got time and you want to learn a little bit, go ahead and pick it up. But overall, I'd rate it as average and nothing groundbreaking."
1,imitation is the most sincere form of flattery...,"the truth be told, author Douglas Atkin began his research on cults and brands more than seven years ago. then his premise was discovered by Forbes about four years ago and eventually became the COVER STORY (in which he is cited) of Forbes on April 16, 2001.Then later, this grad student did a thesis on the same topic and published it as a book.Stick to the real deal: The Culting of Brands: When Customers Become True Believers by Douglas AtkinNot a diluted, ""borrowed"" grad student thesis.Perhaps this is one reason Atkin's book was reviewed by the Wall Street Journal and this grad student thesis was not."
1,On The Wall,"If you are buying and using this book in your own personal business practices, I hope the human race can someday recognize was a horrible cancer you are and eliminate you and your kind - greedy leeches who just want to numb the minds of and completely use other people to their own advantage. GREAT BOOK!"
1,YOU DO NOT GET THE RING IN THE PICTURE.,The ring that actually comes looks like a kindergartener made it. It looks NOTHING like the picture. I used to own the ring in the pic but lost it and was super stoked when i saw it on here. I even tried another size thinking maybe it was just because i chose a really small size. WRONG. WRONG. WRONG. They do not have this ring and they should honestly change the picture as it is false advertising.
3,Mediocre,"I bought this kit mainly for the fact that includes the exercise ball, weights, AND workout dvd. The information claims that the ball included is 65cm, but even with mine inflated to the max, its pushing 55cm; which for someone of my height (5'10) is too small to use for most exercises. For my use it's O.K., but not desired. The dvd is not too exciting and seems like it would be more beneficial to the kit to have one that includes the basic, core strengthening exercises rather than trying to disguise moves as pilates. I am a beginner to fitness in general, but this is not as challenging as I'd like."
1,Out of Date!!!!,Italy has been using the Euro for over two years. These lessons spend much time teaching the student about Lira. It also spends time teaching you BIG NUMBERS. That is really useless when dealing in Euros!Pull this product off your site until it joins the 21st century!The Italian speaking woman is also very difficult to understand. She does not have a clear voice when it comes to the endings of words.
1,Not for students of Italian,"This is not an audio course for a beginner student, or any student for that matter. Had I not had Italian lessons in my past, I would have not been able to use these lessons to speak the language. The initial sounds are clipped so completely that the true word is not audible. I absolutely do NOT recommend this program to anyone interested in learning this beautiful language."
5,Italian Language/Learn in your car,These 9 CDs are an excellent way to learn Italian either in your car or at home.I have been using them for several weeks and learned a lot of words and key phrases.
4,Learn in Your Car Italian Complete (Learn in Your Car),"Starting with valuable travel phrases, the lessons are very logical in progression. Allows you to learn at your own pace in short lessons."
5,Italian in a harry,I have found this proudect very usefull in helping my learn another language.It is clear and has the follow along books so you no only learn the words but also get an understanting of the way it looks in writing.I have only used the product a few times and already the italians i know are able to understand me.I love it!!
5,Clear Introduction to Quantum Physics,"I am using Eisberg's and Resnick's text to review quantum physics. I am particularly impressed by the author's development of plausibility arguements for the mathematics before developing the mathematics itself. I found the first couple of chapters a bit laborious, but the succeeding chapters are very well-written. I was particularly impressed by the chapter on Schroedinger's Theory of Quantum Mechanics and the chapter on Solutions of Time-Independent Schroedinger Equations. I found the text particularly useful for self-instruction and review."
4,review,Not for self study. a fantastic book if you already have some grasp of elementary quantum mechanics and a real talent for following equation manipulation.
4,Pretty good.,"Pretty good, wish there was a bit more illustrations. We did not use it too extensively as it was a support reading, not the main text."
5,The best for physics understanding,"I think that this book on quantum physics is one of the best book ever written about the matter. I suggest this title for graduating students and for everyone that needs to improve or refresh its knowledge on quantum physics. Advice: it needs a previous study of quantum mechanics theory, but chapters about atoms, molecules and solids are very well done."
3,"Not so bad, could be better","Overall, the book was OK, but I thought it was a little too verbose and is as well organised as I usually like books to be. If the examples were boxed and the writing cut down by about 1/3-1/2, it would merit 4 stars. (I don't usually give any book more than 4 stars.) I like the plausibility arguments, but the verbiage could be cut down...and the historical notes are unnecessary for the most part. I like the Griffiths book better."
2,Not so good,"Books like this caused me a lot of troubles. When I began to read Schiff,Messiah and the like I did not understand anything because I was convincedthe (semi)classical description given by the intro books on QM wasessentially right. Thanks to Cohen-Tannoudji (mainly) I discovered I learntvery little from them and I was under the impression that I knew the Physicsbehind QM. Now, I'm enjoying Schiff and Messiah. I find the book somewhatchaotic and verbose, and a chapter devoted to the Bohr's model of the atomseems too much -- this model is easy to grasp, indeed, but definitely false,as it's known since almost a century ago. BTW, if you can read English,don't buy the Spanish translation -- it's the worse I ever seen."
5,Awesome Scanner,"I've gone through 3 scanners- mostly because the resolution has gotten better over time. I added this scanner because of the page autofeed. This one feature alone is worth the price of the scanner. If you scan large documents, you push a button, and can walk away. You come back and the scanner has saved the pages to the hard drive! Its amazing. The scan quality is also superb."
1,"Troublesome, unreliable and unrepairable.","No problem with USB on Win98, Win98SE or Win2K. Software crashes regularly, cannot be uninstalled, won't work with Officejet 1150cse on same computer. Scanner plate glass came dirty on underside, not cleanable. HP support says this won't affect images but it does. Document feeder only worked once. Scan quality good except for dirty spots on scanner plate glass (top edge). Lamp failed after approximately 10 hours of use and is not replaceable (only used every few months). HP support is not helpful, web site difficult and little information on this model. Requires too much time to get working for busy office that only needs occasional scan. Other HP products have been excellent but very disappointed with this one."
4,12 vdc Power Supply,12V 1000MA Regulated CCTV Power Supply AC to DC Power Adapter PW12500R 1ARNO:D12-10-1000. This item is Used-Like New with the power connector wires soldered back on and they are protected with shrink tubing that ha been shrunk areound the positive and negative wires.
5,A delicious piece of music,"From start to finish, this CD transports you to a place rarely visited by mortals. One of my favorites; strong vocals, ethereal music."
2,Written for the UK structural engieer,There was no indication that this pocket book was written based on data for Great Britain. I discovered this only after it arrived!
2,Good book IF you live in the UK!,"The laws, codes and building types are all UK (Great Britain). Pretty useless in the good ole US of A.All the structural stuff is in metric (Yea, I know we should use metric, but we don't).And all the shapes are British Standard.Heck of a nice book, but wrong country."
1,Why spend the money?,"Why buy this product and get an older version of Word and a new version number of Works for the price advertised above when you can get a full-blown office suite that reads and writes Word, Excel and Powerpoint file formats for FREE?I recommend Openoffice.org's Openoffice Suite as a suitable replacement for this over-priced software. You won't get MS Money or some of the other programs but you will get a word processor, plus a spread sheet, drawing , and presentation program for FREE.After all, isn't FREE better than $xxx.xx?"
5,They are great!,This vendor is truly great. I needed info so I asked them a question and they gave me very helpful answers. The package arrived in great shape. They listed it as a new product and it is. If you are going to buy software for your computer this is the place to do it.
2,I thought newer things where suppose to be better,i have microsoft works suite 2002 and i just bought the 2004 and i have to say i like the 2002 better
5,What upgrade?,"I can't understand where people are getting the idea that this is an upgrade. I searched Microsoft's site and there is no mention of an upgrade version.You can use an installation of Microsoft Works to get Microsoft Office at upgrade prices, but there appears to be no qualification to use Works itself.The only caveat is that certain sellers in the ""used and new"" section are selling OEM copies at very low prices. The OEM copies do not provide tech support unless you bought a computer from the company named on the CD or DVD case. However, you can (as I have done) installed an OEM copy and used all the software including Microsoft Word without any problems.Again, given in my review I believe this to be one of the bargains of software, I don't see any reason why this shouldn't be on your computer. I am about to sell my computer and I am buying a new copy for my new computer. I'm sure the person who buys my old computer will think it a bargain that so much software is legally included."
1,Truth in Advertising,"Nowhere in AMAZON.COM's write-up of this product is it mentioned that this is an upgrade that cannot be used unless you alreadyhave certain Microsoft software on your PC. Maybe most MS home users already know this, but still it should be shown as prominently as the system requirements. The write-up did not give me enough information to make a good decision. I will probably not buy software from Amazon.com again."
4,This is definitely worth buying.,"A truly impressive tenor, this sublime cd is worth adding to your collection, especially if, like me, your preferences generally run in favor of symphonic music and not vocals. Even so, this is a sublime recording."
5,Simply the best!,"William Christie's second recording of Medee is superb. Lorraine Hunt's distinctive voice confers on her Medee a magnificent presence,instantly recognizable among other voices. Jill Feldman was a wonderful Medeeback in 1984, but she and Agnes Mellon who sang Creuse sometimes sounded a bit alikewhich made following the plot somewhat more difficult. Mellon was a real highlight of the 1984 recording. Monique Zanetti who signs Creuse here faces a difficult task of matching Mellon's Creuse, yet she does so admirably. But the real improvement between the two recordings is Jason. Tenor Gilles Ragon was a fine Jason in 1984, but, as Gramophone pointedout back then, he was occasionally not quite high enough for thishaute-contre role. With haute-contre Mark Padmore, Christie finally gets it right. In sum, the first Medee was a fine recording, but this one is just spectacular."
2,Easy way out.,"Making Super Heroes into anti-heroes and injecting ""realism"" through tragedy is not great storytelling imho. At least not in an Avengers book(?). Try doing what Waid and Garney did to Cap. Inspire people make them say wow, regardless of age. This kind of deconstruction is meant to appeal to a group of older fans that wanted to see a Marvel version of The Authority. Disappointing."
4,it was interesting,"It was interesting to see this new take on some old favorite characters--Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Wasp, and Giant-Man. And surprisingly Wasp and Giant-Man's story was one of the more interesting ones. It's pretty well done."
2,A Disappointment,So many people praised this book that I read it with high expectations. The art is certainly impressive--good draftsmanship and CG enhancements--but the story moves at a snail's pace. Characterization and reader-interest rely on previous knowledge of the heroes and appreciation of the twist on their previous incarnations. I didn't appreciate it.
3,"Aveng...urm, ULTIMATES ASSEMBLE!","I bought this comic because of friend of mine, he almost put a gun to my head to make me read it.The artwork is AMAZING, all the accolades go to Hitch for how much he improved since few years ago. It made me read whole thirteen issues.SPOILERS:Story: Cap is still same old, but with rougher personality, suiting a pro soldier more than his original Essential Avengers personality. Everyone else is a twisted image of themselves, except Iron Man: Giant Man is sadistic, Janet flirts with Cap and Thor is most likable, although he is stereotypical anti globalist.I can't forgive how they made Hulk look like some version of two legged shark, who is in killing frenzy, horny and stupid. He made more sense to me as a personification of Banner's rage and wish to be alone...and I can't forgive writer for second story arc which, among other stuff, showed nazi Germany as nation run by alien invaders. My grandpa was captured by nazis but too much is too much."
4,If Michael Bay made an Avengers Movie...It wouldn't rock like this book.,"This edgier take on Earth's Mightiest Heroes reads like a fun summer epic. The the story, artwork, and bonus features warrant the extra-large hardcover treatment.The story holds up fine on its own, though I would recommend the first two volumes of Ultimate X-Men (also written by Millar) as an introduction to this world and some the characters who will figure prominently in Ultimates . The later is the superior book, however. The characters are more distinct, the action is more gratifying, and the story has better twists."
1,bleh,"There are two major problems with this series. The first is a problem of pacing. It is apparently possible for something to feel rushed while at the same time doing nothing to advance the plot. The second problem is content. Millar plays the plots and events in this book for shock over true characterization time and again. All in an attempt to make the characters more ""human"" than the original versions. Well, connecting to humanity has never been much of a problem for Marvel characters in the first place. It's always been the company's strong suit. And, additionally, the acts and actions that many of these poor imitations of the classic versions take make them seem far less human and real."
2,"I'm sorry, but...no...","I know I am in the minority for saying this, but I can't stand this series. The plot seems rushed, no one can connect to any of the characters, they don't even bother to tell Thor's origin, and the ending is an unsatisfactory mess. The art is pretty good, but the story is weak. Everyone hails Miller as an excellent writer, but he appears to me to be an over-blown prima donna. (Could the issues have come out at any less of a regular schedual?) Millar's first Ultimate X-Men arc was very good, but nothing he's done since has ever impressed me. If you want to read a really good Ultimate book that's good for all ages, get Ultimate spider-Man. I would fully advise you to skip this over-hyped mess."
2,hackneyed tripe,"this was such a piece of crap. awful writing, funny in all the wrong parts, flat in all the others. what a poor imitation of alan moore's ""watchmen"", from the marvel universe."
2,Who are these people and what did you do with my Avengers?,"I was excited to get this book. Most people rave about it so I figured I would give it a try. After flipping through it at the store I figured it was worth the price simply for the artwork. Well, that is the only thing I liked about the book. I understand that there is an attempt to make Marvel super heroes more real, but does that mean making every character dysfunctional, deranged or damaged in some other extreme way. Every one of my favorite Marvel characters was turned into a scum-wad in this book. There is no way the Captain America I hold dear would kick a beaten man in the face in sadistic glee. And Thor as a bleeding heart anarchist? I don't think so. Basically I think that this book is extremely left-leaning and the author loved taking a big dump on the Marvel Universe's favorite sons (and daughters).Yuck...but at least the art was nice."
4,Good read,This is a nice comic that is well drawn and well written. Once I started it I didn't want to put it down.
4,Review of Millar's 'Ultimates',"This is Millar's itensly contemporary retelling of the Avengers, and its interesting to see how many of his ideas are being incorporated into the Marvel films. The plot of this comic covers the assembly of the team. Millar works hard to make his characters morally ambiguous, but I'm not sure he suceeds quite as much as he would have liked."
3,Insider view of code breaking in WWII,"This is an interesting read. It gives an insider's view of the workings of one of our code breaking services from WWII. Capt. Holmes reveals the way men were handled, rewards hoarded, and secrets broken into parts so that few had a whole scheme view. It is tragic that Joe Rochefort, one of the heroes of Midway, was so roughly handled by his superiors, many of whom were unable to rise above their own pettiness. Three stars(?)- because it does drag in places, but it is a worthwhile read for those interested in WWII and the code breaking apparatus."
3,Dictionary of Dream Symbols,"Book in great condition, brand new. Content is a good summary, but no real in depth informaton."
2,not what I was looking for,"I couldn't get myself to stick to this book. it wasn't what I was looking for, but I thought I might as well read it since I paid good money for it. Still haven't gotten past chapter one though. It is NOT a book to interprete dreams and their symbols. It is lots and lots of words, but definately not an dream interpretaion book like I was looking for.I did discover Ira Milligan's book that is perfect for learning what dream symbols mean. ""Understanding the Dreams You Dream"""
4,Dreams and Visions: Understanding Your Dreams and How God Can Use Them to Speak to You Today,"This book was a delight to peruse. It is simple enough to understand, yet profound enough to prick the consciousness and cause wonder at how God still speaks to us today. It has helped to give clarity to my nighttime musings, and add more meaning to my everyday events. It is worth the price!"
3,Very Interesting,I found the book to be very interesting; however I was more interested in Visions and to me it talked more about dreams. Still a very interesting book.
3,Too expensive!,"While I like Contact paper and have used it for years, I really regret my purchase here because a few days later I found the exact same rolls at Kmart for less than half the price. :(5 stars for the product0 stars for the price here on Amazon (currently at $10.99 per roll)"
4,Works well,"Bought this to put on the outside of my some-day-I'll-replace-them kitchen cabinets in order to lighten up my kitchen, as this is a 'temporary' fix I wanted something quick and easy, and did not try and cover the entire cabinet, choosing instead to run vertical panels from the hinge side to just short of the handles.It doesn't like to stick around corners, though the surface might not have gotten as clean there, but I got what I wanted, a brighter kitchen, at a reasonable cost.It is probably available locally for less--though increasingly I'm finding that it's cheaper to order online unless I have to make a drive anyway.My estimated vehicle cost/mile is around $0.60"
3,Portablity is it's greatest asset,"This xD card reader is a nice small portable device for copying data to and from. However, if you have more than one type of memory card in the house I would suggest a multi-card reader."
4,"Sleek design, makes a perfect thumbdrive too! But only USB 1.1!","This is a sexy xD card reader from Fuji. The clear shell and carrying capsule comes with a wrist strap. Unique sliding lock prevents card from slipping out once inserted into reader. Fully compatible with the new 1GB xD card (even though the box says maximum size is 512MB -- it must be old text). Bright green LED glows to show proper connection and flashes when the card is accessed.The only bad thing about this card is that it runs at USB 1.1 speed only, not the ultra-fast USB 2.0. So if you need to download lots of photos or very large videos, be prepared to wait for the files to transfer. Other than that, a terrific tiny good looking xD reader!"
5,A MUST HAVE!!!!,"This Fuji USB Drive Reader is a must have if you use XD picture cards for your digital camera. I couldn't believe how simple it was to use. With XP OS just plug it in and click away!!! Awesome!!! The XD Drive Reader comes with a strap,short cable and the container is well design. I love it and I highly recommend this little card reader."
4,Love it..,I do love this little piece of convenience. Easy/fast/compact.. I also have a gripe with the fact that the cover piece doesn't stay on very well. I keep mine in a location with little worry for dust or grime- so no real issues for me! But it is the only drawback I really see. Makes a great conversation piece with its clear body- my friends love to comment on it.. they think I'm so high tech :]
3,Another Engineering Text,"I bought this book because I wanted an practical adjunct to accompany my study of linear modeling theory using Stapleton's ""Linear Statistical Models."" Stapleton's text is theoretical where results are explained. I had hoped Kay's book would provide some practical examples from engineering and technology. The problem was that Kay's book just states results. There is no development of the results from beginning theory with examples. Why should one make the assumptions he makes?But this is just my take. From perusing the other reviews of Kay's book, he produces what some other reader's want."
4,"Great Content, questionable Binding","Very well written and easy to follow. The systematic approach to the various forms of estimators clears up what was was originally a 'mess' of estimators and gives concise summaries on the interrelation between them.My only complaint is the poor quality binding which is already starting to fall apart after less than a three months of normal usage. For this price, a proper binding would have been in order."
1,Not compatible with Avery labels,"Seriously. HP e-mail support told me, ""...DeskJet printers like the HP DeskJet D1341 printer is not compatible with the Avery labels."" They actually told me this twice before telling me they had no solution, and that ""...there are times and instances where product specific limitation gives us no choice (but to not solve the problem.)"" The problem is improper feeding of Avery label sheets. It's clear that HP Support believes if labels are to be printed, an HP DeskJet is not the right tool.I want to be clear that this review is more about HP Support than the printer. Fact is that before I begin experiencing the problem, printing labels worked fine. And, it's working again. Label sheets came from the same package in all cases and I performed no printer maintenance. It's a puzzle."
1,Useless junk,I have had this printer for a while and can count on one hand the times it actually works. You turn it on and makes a dramatic scene banging and whirring and clicking for about 10 seconds. You would think with all this noise it could actually print. No. If its not sucking up multiple pieces of paper at once and printing across all of them then its just getting jammed and wrinkling the paper. Most of the time it just doesn't print. I click print and the progress says it's printing pages 3 out of 1. Wonderful. No fixes seem to be available for it. Updated drivers don't seem to fix it either. The dimwits at HP apparently think their crummy drivers aren't the issue but the users. The very few times it actually bothered to do its job it printed decent quality though.
4,HP D1341 DeskJet Printer,"The product itself works well.Installation, however, was a major challenge that, ultimately, involved a total of three hours of phone calls with HP technical assistance. It seems the installation CD was unable to locate and install the applicable ""INF"" files. This had to be done manually by the HP technician."
1,Poor reliability: What a Piece of Junk!,"I opened the box yesterday and I got several problems after then. First of all, the installation CD is bundled with ton of software and it took more than 100MB just to install the driver I really want, I don't understand why HP forces the user to install so many garbage products on user's machine?! Once I installed the software and wired the cable properly and then tried to print, most times it didn't work at all and keep saying paper jam. I then called HP product support line and they didn't solve problem at all.I used Epson and Canon print before and never find any problem. Shame on HP for producing such a poor product. Save your money and buy other products!"
1,printer is no good,The printer grabs several pages at one time. It says cartridges are low on ink when they are not. To see the ink level in the cartridge as a display on the system-----this funciton is impossible to find. I hate this printer.
1,A Waste of Money even for Free!,We've had this printer for at least a year and it has never worked well. It's extremely loud and we cannot print anything without it giving a paper jam error. There is never anything there but it says the print cradle can't move and it makes terrible sounds. We've had numerous Hp printers that worked fine but this is not one of them. This is the kind of printer you want to throw out a second story window onto concrete just to shut it up! Definitely look elsewhere for a printer. It deserves 0 stars.
1,Paper jammer,"If you are looking for a printer that experiences constant paper jams, and low ink warning lights then this is the machine for you!I kid you not, I can print out about 3 pages, and then.... paper jam...My Epson dot matrix printer was more reliable!So were the 2 Canons I owned prior to this hunk of junk. If you don't have enough frustration and aggravation in your life, by all means - buy this printer. If you want a printer that will actually print something out - look elsewhere!"
1,BOOK WAS MUCH SCARIER,I hated this tacky movie and remember reading the book in the late sixties when I was in high school. The book is much better and scarier than this super turkey of a film adaptation.
1,Sound Quality Horrible,I wish there was a way to not give this any stars. The sound quality was so horrible that I couldn't even watch it.
1,"GOOD COPY, LOUSY MOVIE","I, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE, AM A JUNKIE FOR WEWEWOLF MOVIES. AND SO, AND ALSO BECAUSE I'VE HAD A CRUSH ON BARBARA RUSH SINCE I WAS A KID, I TOOK A CHANCE ON THIS TURKEY. FUGGEDABOUTIT!!!!! THIS FILM IS A TRAVESTY, AND AN EMBARRASSMENT TO ALL WHO APPEARED IN IT. OR IT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE. IT GIVES THE GENRE A BAD NAME. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS BOMB IS THE BOX COVER!!"
1,MOON OF THE WOLF,"This movie is CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For being one of those 1972 horror classics, it definitely isn't! It is so boring and the wolf doesn't come till the end of the movie. In the future I hope movies never ever turn out to be as bad as this one!"
3,"Mint Juleps, a Mystery, and Great Actors","Mixed emotions -- fine actors doing fine acting in a surprisingly well-done movie I usualy wouldn't hold still for. Janssen at his classic best a competent sheriff, decent man. Barbara Rush charming as self-confessed heiress raised to do nothing. Well worth watching."
4,DVD Quality,"I'm a sucker for made-for-Tv movies of the 70's like this one. What I hope is helpful to any potential buyer and what I wish reviewers of other releases would comment on more often is the video/audio quality of a specific studio release. The Bci/Eclipse version of ""The Moon Of The Wolf"" is quite good."
4,"""Tonight on the A.B.C. Monday night movie""","Yeap,found another of the movies I loved as a kid. Well in truth I've had this one for years(and many times over, I have it in at least four different mega movie packs),bit this is the best copy I have of this corny but effective ""Werewolf"" chiller from the 70's.David Janssen(the Original ""Fugitive"" and a long time favorite of mine) leads the cast as a southern sheriff looking into a rash of killings in his town. There is a level of carnage about the killings that points more toward an animal than a man.Nothing great here to be sure,but it does have a very sinister feel about the investigation as the leads start pointing to something supernatural, and the attacks step up.As for the cheese factor, sure it's a 70's T.V. movie, it's going to look fake. If you don't want to pay this much buy one of those mega movie packs and get 49 other movies for about $20.00."
3,Great Time Passer,"I originally owned a two-pack VHS of both Moon of the Wolf & Scream of the Wolf, and I recently got both of them on DVD. Moon of the Wolf is a great film to pass the time with, even if the monster looks very similar to Lon Chaney in the ""Wolfman"". I recomend this movie to anyone who is a fan of early horror movies like myself."
3,Liquid dispenser,"The item was received in a very short period of time and was exactly as I had expected as i was replacing an existing product that was eight years old and the plastic components were just breaking down and snapping off. The only issue I had was that this item was listed as new and it was obviously a retutn from someone. The plastic in which it was packed was torn open and one of the soap/shampoo chambers still had a bit of product in it. I did keep the product ""as is"" and it is working as expected."
4,great product,"This product was easy to set up and fill with our shower products. I love that there are no bottles on the side of the tub anymore. The little shelf on top if perfect for the razors and the hooks are great for the poufy scrubbers. The only thing I don't like about it is the tiny amount of soap/shampoo/conditioner that comes from the pump, I have to pump a few times to get enough."
1,Not the Correct Book - Mislabeled,"I ordered this book and the cover did not correspond to the contents. It is only 124 pages. It's been mislabeled, and is just an anti-Burr political tract of the era. Go to the $27.00 book by the same title and same cover, which has 457 pages, approximately. That is the correct book."
2,Not her best book,"I have my ups and downs with this author and this was definitely a down. It was strangely written and the h alternated between being likable and annoying. The actions of the characters at times were ridiculous. But the part that really rubbished it for me, was where she writes about the villain towards the end and about his emotional state. It bordered on the absurd.At certain points I felt like I was missing something and turned back chapters several times to try and understand what had happened. I actually crashed my Kindle because of this and had to download new software in order to finish the book. I shouldn't have bothered.I had high hopes for this book because I enjoyedOnce upon a Kiss, which was also a medieval. Sadly this did not live up to expectations."
3,needs editing,"Generally the storyline was good but there are a lot of editing needs. Examples the type font keeps changing from one chapter to the next. And multiple times the use if reign when rein was correct. There were some really hokey lines like ""he sheathed his sword in her""."
5,The best investment you'll make,"""Getting Started in Options"" clearly explains what options are and how to use them to your advantage. Either as protection on stock investments or as investments unto themselves. I've been trading stocks for a number of years and learned from this book how I could maximize the returns from my existing stock. I recomend this book to anyone from a serious investor to a novice. As an investment, this book will probably give you the greatest return on your money you will ever make."
5,Michael Thomsett is a Winner,"I originally bought this book in 2001. The latest revision has been completely updated with new 'stuff'. Michael writes in a very down home manner making all the concepts clear and easy to understand. When you are done you will want to trade immediately. (Called Emotion, don't do it)Read it through cover to cover no notes. Then read it again and mark the heck out of it. Then read it a third time to absorb your notes and scan the rest looking for what you missed the second time around.This is by far the best introduction to Option Trading that I have read."
3,Dwells Too Much on the Basics,"Thomsett's wordy and repetitive explanations of buying Puts and Calls and selling Covered Calls fills about 180 pages of his 210 - page text. He relegates the more interesting discussion of combined techniques to the last 20 pages. Here he gives you enough information to perk your interest, but not enough to motivate you to try these techniques. For example none of the figures in Chapter 9 suggest that you can loose money trading spreads, straddles and strangles"
3,Step 1,"This book is exactly what it says it is, a 'how to' for getting started. It is a very very basic look at Options trading."
3,Very repetitive,"Thomsett provides the necessary information, but it requires great patience to absorb it all. He repeats himself constantly, as if the goal were to stretch the number of pages in the book.After reading this book, I found another book that provided all I needed to know to get started with options. It's concise and easily understood. Read the following and be ready to make some money using options: The Short Book on Options: A Conservative Strategy for the Buy and Hold Investor"
5,an excellent starting point for understanding options!,This book is ideal for the novice interested in understanding and trading options. With examples and scenarios given throughout it clears up any questions one might have regarding what was just read. I wish that all options books were as easy to understand as this one.
4,Awesome,"This book is great for the beginner in Options, because of the repitition and all the examples. This would make a good teaching utensil to use when learning about option basics."
3,"Dry, confusing book","I dunno-- it's comprehensive, true, but the examples are boring and it's hard to focus. I still don't quite get the difference between selling and buying a put and selling and buying a call... or when to use each. The design of the book is great, the sidebars are lovely, but I wish a stronger editor had goosed it up a bit."
3,Getting Started in Options,There is a significant and misleading error re: last trading day. Page 66 states last trading day is Friday before third Saturday of the month. Not true when first Saturday is first day of month.Last trading day is third Friday of the month.
1,disappointing,After reading this book I felt it was a waste of my time. It reads like a book that is writen by a book writer that has not much experience with the subject. It takes the basics and makes it a struggle to read. Impersonal and dry.
2,Somewhat helpful,This book is somewhat useful in terms of getting the basic strategies and terms of options trading down. But the author spends too much time detailing the obvious.
5,SIMPLY UNDERSTOOD!!!,GETTING STARTED IN OPTIONSGetting Started in Options (Getting Started In.....)as an introductory guide to the potentially risky and complicated world of options trading; this book written by MICHAEL C THOMSETT makes learning the language and possibilities SIMPLY UNDERSTOOD!!! purchased this book after previous reading as permanent reference in my library of financial tools along with GETTING STARTED IN FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSISGetting Started in Fundamental Analysisalso titled by MICHAEL C THOMSETT as another well written financial reference source!!!
5,True introduction from the basic terminology to strategy,"This book is truely an introduction to options trading. It assumes you know nothing and takes you from the very basics of terminology to an understandable overview of strategy. Even if you have never heard of a call or a put before, you will leave this book prepared to: - read more technical texts - evaluate whether options are right for you - speak intelligently about options - ask appropriate questions of options professionals"
4,Good Introduction To Options,"This is a good first step primer for those that are unfamiliar with options. It really attempts to break down the vocabulary for the lay person to understand the concepts.Where it fails is no fault of its own. With the addition of security futures and single stock futures, many of the strategies of picking market direction and synthetics are not as valuable.In order to get most out of a book like this you need to have a second book ... that explains how futures and options can work in tandem."
4,Good for general knowledge only,"This book provides a general knowledge base of basic option terms and descriptions, with generic examples included. You'll come away with a basic knowledge of primarily calls & puts (both buying & selling), and some advanced strategies. However, you'll need further reading to help you navigate the real options trading world. Primarily discipline, setting stops and taking profits when you can before time decay erodes the gains or the stock turns in the wrong direction. Not to mention buying strategies (finding the right stocks and the navigating the bid/ask when buying & selling).For it's purposes, this is a decent book. Just realize you'll need to do more reading to become an ""expert"""
4,Good place to start,"For those looking to get started in options but knowing very little about them, this is a decent book to begin with. I felt the addition of a few easy-to-read summary charts or tables adding a visual to the differences between calls/puts, sells/buys would have been helpful. But you're eventually hit with enough examples that it's reasonably easy to understand. I would recommend it to learn about options, but not as an options investment book."
3,"Good, choppy, somewhat out of date","The good part is that he covers all the basic and advanced option trades. He gives useful and good ideas about trading, and many warnings. However, the writing is choppy because he constantly inserts examples, sidebars and graphs which are not integrated into the flow of the text and are annoying. I don't get why he calls the exercise or strike price a 'striking price,' or why he insists on trades as whole-dollar amounts ($1.00, $2,00, etc.) when everyone trades in dollars and cents ($1.26, $3.71, etc.). The book is certainly worth the time and money to study, and as a reference."
3,Be prepared to cover the same thing over and over,"While I found this book helpful, it is clear that the author is a generalist and not an options expert. He is continually giving similar examples of using the same strategy and at other times is discussing different strategies (he has a whole paragraph & example about puts in the Selling Calls section) in chapters related to specific strategies. Overall, this is an acceptable book as a primer, but I'm definitely looking for more help to discover what strategies to use in my options portfolio. Hopefully, though, they have fixed some of the typos and edited better in the next edition coming out soon."
1,Getting Started in Options,"I have yet to receive this book. Insofar as it was advertised as being available, why all the delay? I do hope my credit card has not been debited for this transaction as it is now one month and there is still no book. I will probably buy my books in a book store from here on.Phil Becker, Glendale, CA"
2,Would you desire to crash your car?,"I stopped reading this book when I read: ""When you buy a put, your desire is that the underlying stock's value will fall below the striking price; the more it falls, the higher your profit.""I was afraid the author would try to convince me that, after I buy insurance for my car, I should hope for my car to be crashed.OK. I understand this book is written for people that do not know much about options (like me). But this does not mean the author has to write things that are not true.I buy puts and I hope the stocks I buy puts on to soar."
4,to each his own,you people don't know what you're talking about. it's albums like pain of mind and word as law that gave neurosis their start. without albums like this you wouldn't have your precious times of grace and through silver in blood (not that those aren't also good albums). this was the first album i heard by them and it made me the neurosis fanatic i am today. just because you aren't fans of hardcore doesn't mean this is a bad album-
5,Nightbird,Eddie Dee is one of the finest detective story writers today. He has the unique ability to keep the story captivating without sacrificing details.
3,Love Old Movies,"This wasn't as good as many other Bob Hope movies, so I didn't donate this one to the public library."
5,Great Stings!,"These strings are awesome!! They are really sturdy and the keep tune VERY well. They are a nice color on my acoustic guitar, and are easy to assemble.I totally recommend these for beginners(they are not to hard on your fingers when starting out)and I will defiantly buy these again! Oh yeah, and the company has SUPER fast shipping another plus!"
3,"Not the best of DeVries, but that's better than most","Peckham is happily situated at the Garden of Disfunction. Hello! He meets the widow of the founder of the looney bin and makes her his own - until a greater foe approaches. Who's crazier? That's always been DeVries's forte, piano, mezzo, and other operatic jokes. But seriously folks, the man runs rings around the English language, dropping puns anywhere he thinks you're not looking. Watch your step."

But seriously folks, the man runs rings around the English language, dropping puns anywhere he thinks you're not looking."
4,An Introduction to Interpreting Scripture,"Many wags have said that Kaiser is always moving ""toward"" something, but he has never ""arrived"" at it yet. But his works represent good, if preliminary, studies of any subject he writes on.Kaiser in an OT scholar, so it is not surprising his best work is found in that field. But his introduction to methodolgy is sound, if not perfect. Thorough, if not exhaustive. And it is one that ought to be examined by anyone who desires to be a serious student of the word.There are a couple of times one would wish he had followed his own methods more carefully, one is in a foray into the NT, where he proposes a unique inerpretation of 1 Cor 14:34 that has since made D.A. Carson's ""Exegetical Fallacies."" But other than this rather grandiose faux pas, the rest of the work is convincing."
1,Review of the kindle edition,"This is a poorly formatted ebook. The text is forced into a difficult font (unchangeable). The word spacing is variable so that the text at any size contains rivers of whitespace flowing down the middle of the ""page"" rather than on having an uneven right hand side of the page like a book. Either wait for a properly formatted kindle version or buy the hard copy."
5,The Top Book of Chip's Top Ten (wordsntone.com),"No other book helped me to become better at studying the Bible and preaching. Should be required reading for all pastors, missionaries, and anyone who stands before others and says, ""This is what the Bible says."" If I had a million dollars, I'd buy a copy for every pastor in American. Don't hesitate-Get it, read it, follow it!"
4,An indespensible guide to conversational idioms,"This very conveniently organized, compact and user-friendly book should be a staple on every Gaelic learner's bookshelf. It not only provides an excellent vocabulary of idiomatic phrases, but does so with the pithy wit that Scottish Gaels are so famous for.Phrases are pressented in idiomatic English, idiomatic Gaelic and phonetic transcription side by side. The phonetics are fairly intuitive and easy to use. Basic gramar points are also covered, but as sidebars to the main focus, which is conversation.This book truly fills an essential function in the progression from beginning to intermediate skill in Gaelic."
4,Awesome book!,"I have many Irish relatives and many of the older ones speak Gaelic. So, when I saw this book I had to order it! Ever since it came in I've been learning like crazy and starting to speak whole sentences. This was a great purchase!"
4,great christmas gift,"my husband love it when we had it in our other house , was glad I found it again .Thanks"
5,Liquid soap dispenser,This product performed as described and appears to be very durable. I bought the two chamber dispenser for liquid soap only so that when one chamber isempty I would have the other chamber ready and available. I am very satisfied with this product.
5,Hysterical!,"This is a hysterical little book filled with vintage advertising images from the 40s and 50s with witty little snippets about life and love added to them. My favorite of the saucy little sayings are ""You must have me confused for the maid we don't have"" and ""I finished your laundry, the ashes are in the fireplace"".If you know someone who's a little jaded and in need of a pick me up, this is the perfect gift. It's just too cute!"
5,More therapeutic reading,Hopefully the second book from these two talented men will not be the last.
2,DON'T BUY THIS!,"FOR BEING A D.O.A FAN FROM THE 80'S,THIS RECORD WAS THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT..I RATED THIS 2 STARS,AND THAT'S BEING VERY GENEROUS!"

5,grreat show,This was a cool show back in the day I would take this over a lot of shows now I wish they would make another show like this
3,It's ...ok,"I use to watch this show with my family as a kid. I don't believe a person who's not familiar with this show or similar shows from this era will enjoy this.I enjoyed seeing Muhammad Ali and other celebrity guests from the 70's. My daughter has never seen a young Muhammad Ali and can't relate to how popular he was at this time. While younger people who've watched Martin Lawrence's Shanana character may not realize she is an updated version of Flip's Geraldine, they probably will enjoy watching Shanana more than Geraldine."
2,Not What I wanted,I love Flip Wilson but this dvd was a bit dissapointing. He played Geraldine but where is Rev. Leroy?
5,About Flip Wilson,He should have ran longer than four years - I thought he was really great. Another thing - he used to call all his characters Leroy; I had a chocolate point Siamese cat named Leroy when he was on in prime time.
1,The past is the past sometimes....,I remember this show as being very funny and risque humor. Viewing it today and it looks dull and stilted. Nothing about the humor seems funny in today's light. I ended up donating this to an old folks home...

I think this shows his total contempt for the children and the parents of the island.If we had watched a film of American children watching such films as Jackass (where men stick things up their butts, and worse, etc) wouldn't we have found it to be sick? The attitude here seems to be, they are natives so who cares.I know children are exposed to lots of things in life, but this shows total disrespect to them.If you want to watch a film about Ugly Americans, this is it.If you are expecting a film about bringing films to people living on a remote island and what their reactions are, this ISN'T it."
2,"Reel Paradise should be renamed ""Real Torture""",I was so excited to see this movie. I envisioned Jon Pierson as a venturing Rick Steves type. Unfortunately even after a year in paradise he still had an edgy up-tight annoying personality. I would have hated to see him *before* he took this trip to paradise.
1,SADLY DISAPPOINTING!,"I have now read all 11 books in this series and would not discourage anyone from beginning them - HOWEVER - be aware that only the first ones are good. Her last books pale. This book is so disappointing I had to force myself to finish. She has made Lori the main character and pushed Aunt Dimity to a non-existant role. Dear old ""dead"" aunt Dimity, writing from beyond in the journal, was the reason I began reading this series. She is now defunct and Atherton has turned Lori into a ""superwoman"". Disgusting and disappointing. When I tried to reach her via her website to inform her of a fan's falling away I discovered she doesn't even keep up the website and provides no outlet for comment. Do read the first 6 or 7 - but be prepared to read the last unfulfilled. Too bad because if another surfaces I will have to reconsider purchasing upon reading the review and even then - reconsider again."
3,Dislike Lori,"Enjoy Atherton's writing, but dislike Lori Shepard. I was hoping she'd get killed (isn't that awful). She is obnoxious. Bill deserves better."
3,Insipid Island Mystery,"Having been a long time fan of this series, I'm sorry to say that I've felt that the last few were mostly going through the motions. The main setting for this one is interesting but really not well developed. The plot lines feel contrived. Pick it up if you're a completist. Maybe it is time for Ms. Atherton to branch out and write from a different prespective?"
4,Castle of Shelter,"A disgruntled client is threatening Lori Shepherd's family for revenge against her husband, Bill. Bill stays in London, but Lori and the twins are sent off to an island off the coast of Scotland.Sir Percy Pelham is the owner of the castle, but the inhabitants of the island are surprisingly well off. Is Sir Percy involved in smuggling or something more sinister when a human skull washes up on the beach?With the help of Aunt Dimity's ghost Lori begins to pull pieces of the puzzle together, but can she solve it before she becomes are piece of the puzzle.Just the right mix of ghostliness, whodoneit, and pure fun to keep you reading until the last page.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
2,Disappointed,This is my first Aunt Dimity book and I must say I was disappointed.Spoilers below:Aunt Dimity does nothing at all. The plot would be no different if she was removed.There is no mystery to solve. Everything involving the search for Abaddon happens off-screen while Lori traipses about the island.The confrontation with Abaddon (which is the only scene with any sense of peril) is resolved in the most unsatisfying way. The bad guy is struck by lightning and falls off a cliff. No need for any of the characters to do anything.The sticky lemon cake does sound yummy.
1,Inferior Product (at least mine was!),"The price was certainly right for these poles but within an hour of starting to hike with them, the plastic retaining pin that holds the straps in place fell out on each pole Now if you're going to use this to walk to the local park, that might not be a problem but I was hiking Mt. Washington and relying on these poles to get me up and down, so the inferior construction actually put my health at risk. I was able to construct an improvised repair by using some wood pieces and threading them carefully through the holes for the retaining pin.One of the poles also bent when it was temporarily caught in some rocks. That was perhaps more understandable. And the two poles did survive heavy use up and down the mountain. Still if you were going to rely on these and found that you dropped it or could not use the strap to help hold the pole on any kind of climb up or down, you'd be in trouble.Should not be sold in this condition."
5,very good,"This replaced my older (broken) one. It's well built, good quality and the cork handle sure is a big plus for comfort!! No complaints!"
2,Had to send back,Received item and could not get the sections to stay locked. Sent back immediately.Received full reimbursement so I will now look for another one
3,hiking poles not for everyone...,"I bought these hiking poles, worst mistake of my life! I hiked the maine section of the AT (Appalachian trail), and within the first week my poles bent, and I had to hike the rest of maine with bent hiking poles. I wish someone wrote a review for really intense hiking. If it is just for a walk in the park, these poles will be fine. BUT NOT ON LONG AND INTENSE HIKING TRIPS!!! THEY WILL BEND! THe compass and thermometer do not even work. Even if they are cheaper, it is NOT WORTH IT! It will be worth spending the extra money for better poles."
3,new hiking pole,i need to learn how to properly use it and i need to learn how to have best posture for my body.
3,Hiiking Stick,The stick is light for carrying. I initially had some trouble unscrewing and adjusting the telescoping stick. Hand grip is comfortable for carrying. Too bad it won't collapse to a shorter length to stow in a backpack.
3,Collapsable walking pole,The adjusters require a pair of pliers to loosen and tighten. That defeats the purpose of being able to collapse it for travel.
4,As expected,"Arrived timely. As expected like the description. Never used a stick before, but thought it would be handy when I hike.The stick lenghthens easily."
5,Hiking stick !,"Wow, did not think any hiking stick would hold up too what I put it through but this one out performed my expectations ! I'm 6'5'' 280/Lbs Use this on my weekly hikes in mud and snow. Had too put all my weight on it a few times, even had it stick in the mud with all my weight on it and it did not snap :) I thought it should of but did not ! Would recommend ! You can find sismilr ones at K-Mart for a lot less but not sure if the construction or quality of the product is the same."
5,walking pole,"this was perfect and i love it. When i measured the length i wanted, and set it at that length....it stayed...thank you, it will allow me to go down the steams with slippery rocks...nan"
5,"Great Anti-Shock, cork handled walking pole!","I took this collapsible hiking pole with me to Machu Pichu and used it over thousands of steep steps, inclines, declines. and uneven jungle trails! It worked far better than several others used by fellow hikers, as it has a cork handle that does not become slippery from sweaty hands in this tropical climate (on the edge of the Amazon jungle). The attached compass and thermometer were a plus too. I will use it again and again, as it packs nicely in my luggage."
4,Solid value trekking pole,I use a pair of these poles and have found them to be reliable and the cork grip is comfortable with and without gloves in hot and cold. These poles represent a good value. I would recommend purchasing additional tips as they sometimes sneak away.
2,"One good, one aweful","I ordered 2 of these hiking poles for my trip to Yosemite. One of the poles worked well. The other one bent the first day, the bottom section of the pole. The next day, the middle section of the pole bent. While the pole was still usable the next 2 days, I was leery of them, afraid that one or the other would bend again. I would not buy again, and I would not recommend to anyone else."
4,Nice,"Nice walking stick. Only problem was adjusting up and down. Once I got it broke loose, it was OK.Oveall nice stick."
3,Not really an amazing stuff,I have been using this product for over a month and cant really see a noticeable change in my ingrown hairs of my bikini area... it might work better with light in growth hair problems... not me
5,Excellent Product for Multi-Cat Households,We have several cats in our home and marking becomes a problem. With the Nutri-Vet plug-in diffuser our cats have not been marking as these natural pheremones keep them calm and happy. I have tried other brands with not as much success. I highly recommend this product.
2,This is potpourri! Do not confuse this with Feliway.,"Do not confuse this product with the Pheromone containing ""Feliway.""I bought this product thinking I would save some money, but after doing some research, I've found no conclusive evidence that it has any effect on cats. It DOES, however, affect HUMANS. The stuff has a VERY strong smell. Yuck.The stuff is even packaged to LOOK like Feliway, it fits in the same diffuser. But don't be fooled."
4,"Fantastic idea, but not for all situations","Using this refill with the diffuser is a great idea. It is recommended in every cat behavior book I have read for everything from cat aggression to litter box problems. Since I have been using the diffuser (I bought the refill as a backup), there has been a slight difference in the aggression issues between two of my cats (I have four). But the real issue in my house is that the main kitty culprit was not raised around its mother so does not understand proper cat etiquette. I was hoping the pheronomes would help calm the situation, but there are still cat fights resulting from her bad manners. But I still would recommend trying it."
1,didn't work,didn't work on my cats.....still urinating and spraying inappropriately. I keep wasting my money on this kind of thing...don't know why.
4,Great Product,"My cat is very high maintenace and loves to ""scream"" like a baby when she doesnt get what she wants. She also pulls her hair out, literally, when I leave for a weekend. She doesnt like to be alone. Last night I plugged this in for the first time - within an hour she was noticably more sedate. I dont plan on unplugging this product! The true test will be when I get back from vacation....."
2,Didn't work for me,Tried this product and it did not seem to make any difference on our cats. It did smell nice however. What did work for us was the Bach Rescue Remedy which did help calm our guys.
5,Dominant,"I saw Les Arts Florissants and Christie perform this live in 2001, and I still consider it the most crushingly beautiful experience of my classical-music lifetime (I've been listening for almost 40 years now). Needless to say, I agree with the five-star recommendations above. The Deller recording is nice in its own way, but it's just not in the same league as a historic recording as this. If severely pressed, I might go so far as to say that if one could have only one baroque recording, this should be the one."
3,Average Quality,"I don't think I'll ever find a high quality shower caddy. This one is like all the rest and I expect I'll replace it in a few years as it begins to rust away and look really horrible. It earned an extra star because of one nice feature, plastic shelf holders that slide over the tubing and then lock into the shelf making the shelves a lot sturdier than using rubber O-rings."
2,eventually rusted,"The caddy fits nicely in the corner of the shower and the shelves can be positioned easily on the pole - holding firmly where they are placed. The pole comes in two pieces and fits together ok however, after about 2 years mine rusted at the ends - even if covered with the foot cap or with the joint tape they provide. This may be unavoidable in the wet surroundings unless you get a PVC pole."
3,shower pole caddy,"a little flimsy for heavy bottles of shampoo, etc but a good value and fairly inconspicuous ie not unattractive"
4,Fun Book!,"Overall this is a fun read that touches on the high points of what it takes to be a pervy photographer. I'd recommend it. Would be nice if there was some deeper details on photo technique, but I guess that isn't really what the book is aiming at.Keep up the pervy work Charles!!(...)"
3,Purchased as a gift.,A gift for the nephew. He played with it for quite a while. I don't know if he liked it or not. A few pieces broke on it.
5,Teaching Kids to Read for Dummies,"I was very satified with the condition of the book and the quick service. I have not had time to read the book, but I do like books for dummies."
2,It's not as advertised...,The description of this product says that it is WIRELESS... well it isn't. It has wires connecting to the two egg massagers.My wife was less than thrilled when we received it due to the not so WIRELESS issue. We have tried it anyway and while she did enjoy it she will not use it again due to the feel of the wires when it's inside of her.Get a wireless one that is actually wireless. Women will enjoy it more and so will the guys with a remote control that can be set off from almost anywhere in the house for some added fun.
2,ehhh,Girlfriend says there not to powerful you can tell when you turn them on that they are kind of weak.
4,great watch,"i got this watch for 2,000 in New York, and this is great price, the watch never ceases to impress, however be careful the band can get scratched easier then i would like. this is a great everyday watch"
2,a nice try,"I am a big Phantom fan, and not just of the Weber version, so I was excited about this. The actors were good and the costumes and sets were very well done, and be aware this is a stage production and not a movie, so it is a little different. Alas, the music was very disappointing. It seemed that everything was professional, but the music was community theatre at best. Maybe even high school (not to diminish either). But like I said the actors are very good. It is a pity they didn't have more to work with. Don't let this be the only phantom you see. I really like the Robert Englund movie. Yes it is violent and gory at times, but it has the music that this one should have had. Also don't forget Weber. His music also fulfills in ways this cannot."
3,""" Soul Of Darkness """,""" In a certain sense, it has a obvious criteria but it is kept hidden by an equally obvious century old operandi. """
1,Dissapointed,This was completely different from what I have expected. It cannot be a musical but a drama with music.
3,"Not the best, but not the worst","The music of this theater drama is not one like Lyyod-Webber's but the voice talents are very exceptional. There is one song that will grab your attention called or I assume ""Perfect Music."" This song can relate to ""Music of the Night"" because of the its timing. Elizabeth Walsh stars as Christine and is very convincing, even more so than Sara Brightman was In Lyyod-Webber's version. In all, this is an average theatrical version of The Phantom of the Opera."
2,Not what I hoped,"A friend of mine lent this to me. I recently became a Phan, and I'm trying to get my hands on every version out there. I understood very well from the beginning that this was not the Lloyd Webber version we all know and worship. The only redeeming thing I found about this other stage version, however, is that the beginning explains more about Christine and Raoul and how they met.I thought this particular version missed the entire point of the story. I was very disappointed with the ending. The sets were very elementary, and I didn't find the music all that stimulating. Maybe I've just been spoiled with the Lloyd Webber Phantom, but I wouldn't recommend this to diehard phans who like the story the way it should be."
1,Great disappointment enlight of Broadway Production,"In August of 2001, I attended the ""Phantom of the Opera"" production in the traveling Broadway Series from New York at the Majestic Theater in San Antonio, Texas. It was a superb performance which I wanted to remember by purchasing this video production which I assumed was close to the original. This production was totally different. The screenplay, the scenes, the storyline, and most of all the graphics were pathetic; not at all like the original from Broadway. The acts wern't coherent with the plot of the drama. It was a great ... disappointment to me and my family. Don't purchase this one unless you enjoy let downs."
2,It was an ok movie,"Well if you are an Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the Phantom phan, this movie would be an OK movie to you. The music wasn't as good as A.L.W.'s, and the voices of the characters were OK. But Sarah Brightman's voice over-ruled Elizabeth Walsh's voice, and David Staller's voice is not competition for Michael Crawford's amazing voice! The ending showed Erik as a undevoted lover to Christine. As it shows him going on to the next girl after Christine runs away with Raoul, but not in voice but in dance. OK, that was not anything like the original book by Gaston Leroux, as it is said to be on the back of the video cover! I give the 2 stars for the phantom's make-up. It's the best I've seen! Other than that, if you are an Andrew Lloyd Webber version phan dont get this video! It's a big disapointment! :)"
4,Serendipity,"For those who want Webber's version, this isn't it. It does, however, stand quite well on its own as a very beautiful and moving play with music that is very emotional, and in one or two cases, visceral. Elizabeth Walsh's voice is incomparable, both speaking and singing, and her acting is fresh and natural. Her Christine is quite believable. David Staller's performance is truly moving. He has managed to capture Erik's desperate desire for human contact, as well as his immature petulance and arrogance, not to mention his sense of humor and flamboyance. Mr. Staller portrays an entirely sympathetic Phantom. At times he's laugh-out-loud funny; at others the tears will flow.Since I know of no Webber version on tape, this one is better than just a substitute. This one is phun."
1,this is garbage,This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased . DO NOT ! buy this junk.I am returning it even though I will not get a refund.
1,guacala,"esta version del fantasma de la opera es realmente espantosa. no se parece en nada a la version teatral, no hay buena musica, buenas actuaciones ni nada. NO LA COMPREN PORQUE SE ARREPENTIRAN..."
1,The worst thing I ever saw.,"The story, music, acting, and vocals was very weak. If you love weber's music, you will hate this."
1,I'm not happy,"The cover of this DVD make you believe it is the Webber version but with a different cast. It is until you have it in your hands that you realize its not. The music and the quality of the production is not nearly as good as the Webber version and I think the cover should not mislead by saying that David S. is as good as Crawford and Elizabeth W. is warmer than Sarah Brightman. This makes people believe that in fact it is the Webber version with a better cast than Crawford and Brightman when it's not.I'm not saying the cover should say in big that this is not the Webber version, but why not to say who's version it is? The only answer I find is that they want people to think so.The truth is that I wish I could return it."
2,NOT the ALW version...and yet...,"This version of The Phantom of the Opera is NOT the ALW version...and should not be expected to be as stunning as the Broadway play. This was not my favorite Phantom...and yet, for it's amateur quality, I found myself liking it just the same. Though it strays somewhat from the original novel, it is still a bit closer to Leroux than the ALW version.Though it has shortcomings...if you are a die-hard Phantom fan...put this version in your Phantom collection."
4,David Staller is too good for this.,"If your looking for an Andrew Lloyd Webber version this is NOT it. But if your looking for a fresh new interpretation. You've come to the right place. This movie was staged at the Al Hirschfield Theater in Florida. It's more of a comedy than a romance. It's based more on Leroux's novel and even includes ""Doroga"", the Persian Police Inspector. The set's are low budget, and the background music is highly synthesized. In spite of all this David Staller does not disappoint. His angelic voice and his passionate acting alone are a good enough reason to watch this movie. I would have LOVED to see him act in ALW's version."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"How anyone can claim this better than Andrew Lloyd Webber's version is beyond me. The lead female is good-I would have liked to have seen her in Andrew Lloyd Webber's version. The songs are unmemorable, the acting is sub-par, and the sets are some of the worst I've ever seen. One a positive note, the actors who play the managers are quite good, but don't but the video because of them. Don't buy it for any reason."
3,"No comparison to Lloyd Webber or Kopit/Yeston, but...","I did like the Phantom. He was played well by David Staller, and had an exceptional voice. However the story and the rest of the characters lacked everything good and what was needed to put forth a truly great show. I also did not like how mellow it was. The Phantom of the Opera is a horror, a romance, a thriller. This was just a story. Also the ending was very disappointing. However, as a desperate and obsessive Phantom Phan, this is a must for collectors. But only because the Phantom was well-played."
3,O_o Ummmm...,"Well the singing was okay and it was kind of funny,but it didn't make my top ten that's for sure."
3,If you love Phantom you will get a kick out of this!,Got this Video just the other day. I was so excited to watch it never knew it was out. I am a BIG Phantom and Lloyd Webber fan but I am a fan of Phantom in all forms..this production is a medium to well grade production video...That I laughed myself to tears in parts...It is alot of fun and if you just need that Phantom fix...here you go...I really recomend it...I am gunna share it with all of my friends they will love it...a GOOD TIME FOR ALL!
1,A desaster beyond your imagination will occur!,"Honestly - this title ought to be removed from every list of serious retailers, it's a fraud in many senses! The whole show looks like some provincial amateur staging. I cannot judge the music, because the copies are such poor quality in picture and sound that one can barely notice that there's a musical score at all... Copyright issue: even the producer's trailermusic is stolen from another filmcompany! The only star goes out for the best phantom makeup I've ever seen. To every Phantom phan out there: don't touch this one, ""or a desaster beyond your imagination will occur""!"
3,"Less Science, More History and Mythology","Definitely had some good points; interesting information and footage. However, it contains a lot about the history of weather, what different cultures thought about weather, myths, legends, and the gods. If that's what you're looking for, you've found it. I was looking for something that explained weather from a scientific aspect, which this movie does, at times."
4,My boys liked it,"We're devotees of the eyewitness series, so we thought we'd try it. My boys liked it, although perhaps not as much as the series. It is a series of videos, not still photos. That was my main concern--is it just the same pictures from the books, just with narration? It isn't. I'm going to use it to supplement a 4-8th grade science class."
4,Nice Fan,This is a nice inexpensive case fan that runs quiet and gets the job done. I will probably order another.
2,Meh,"I bought the Antec 3 speed 120 mm fan at the same time and I would recommend it over this fan. Even with the resistor, this fan is still noisier. The pins are a nice touch but I would be nice if they included 5 pins incase you tear one. I'm thinking about adding another resistor but I'm afraid that would make it too weak."
3,"Okay, not sure if it was worth it though","I just built my first rig and went with one of those Corsair closed-loop water-coolers for my CPU, which works fine but is rather loud; hence, the zalman ""quiet"" case fan upgrade from the default corsair fans. However, the Zalmans are just as loud as I can't use the silicon pins on the radiator. While I'm guessing a lot of the noise comes from that, it seems like there should have been at least some appreciable difference, or zalman could have at least put some silicone washers in with the pins in case people wanted to use normal mounting screws rather than the oftentimes difficult-to-install pin things. Either way, they're still fans, just not particularly quiet ones"
4,Fan Okay,"THe fan works fine. It just did not have a power rating listed. I found it was too large to run with the adapter I purchased so I sent it back and got the ZM-F2. Had the power consumption been listed on the technical specs, then there would have been no problem and I would not have gotten this one."
5,Victim's Family Rock,"One of the most origional albums and bands I have heard for quite a while. So origional it's really hard to classify, but I suppose you could call it punk. Reminds me a little of Plaid Retina, though it is by no means a copy. I had to listen to it a few times to really appreciate, I think because it is so different from anything I'd heard. If you like new sounds and origional bands, then buy this. If you take what you like from the radio or MTV or think Metallica is hardcore then don't. Your small mind won't be able to handle this. Also the Germ is quite good though I think this is better."
4,Horror Fan,"I really enjoyed this film! it may be very corny but that doesn't matter, it has a fast pace, some great gore, a lesbian situation and a disturbing incest moment, but overall I still loved this film!"
2,"Dispensers Made of Cheap, Fragile Plastic - Beware!","I bought a similar type of dispenser back in 1995, when I was outfitting my new apartment. Perhaps that was the Dispenser Classic I. That one lasted 11 years without a problem and I threw it out only because it looked old and I was moving. Flash forward to 2011. I decided to buy one for my condo. A day or two after I put in the bottles, I noticed shampoo from the dispenser dripping onto the faucet. It turns out that one of the bottles had a hairline crack in it. It was tiny but enough to cause a serious leak. I examined the bottles closely and realized how thin and cheap the plastic containers really are. Unbelievable. Now I have to decide whether to use Crazy Glue or go through the hassle of emptying the two other containers and sending the whole thing back to Amazon for a refund. If this is the Classic III, I wonder how bad IV will be. I'd be hesitate to order this again."
5,"High quality product, very satisfied",It was easy to install and works well. Seems like a high quality product. Push buttons feel solid and dispense the proper amount.
4,Shower soap dispenser,Purchased this item on Amazon to part out for repairs of two other previously installed like units. The units being repaired have been in place over 15 years so I think its safe to say they are fairly durable. And the dispenser I purchased for parts was exactly like the ones I was repairing so (of course) everything fit perfectly. I was glad to see the manufacturer had not changed the design in any way. So now I've got a cache of unused parts if ever needed for future repairs. I just hope I can remember where I ratholed this unit next time I need parts.
1,Fell off the wall,"After two weeks the tape did not hold and it fell off the wall. Just as well, had to press dispensor too many times for the shampoo. Taking it back and buying a different brand."
3,Was given as a gift -- no feedback from recipient,"It was sent fast and packed well. As the recipient hadn't informed me how well it works, I can't really review properly."
3,Dispenser III,I like this product. Had a Dispenser II and loved it. I broke the bottles and it was cheaper to order new than just buy the bottles. So I got a dispenser III. It has broken because the latch is not made as well as the older Dispenser II. I wish they would make it more stubantial like they did in the past.
2,"Great concept, poor quality","This is my third unit. The first one lasted a year before one chamber became clogged. I couldn't find how to just order one, so I had to order an entire new unit to replace the chamber. Then I moved. Really need space saving in my shower, so I ordered another one. From the first day, can't get the soap to dispense. Not very happy with the quality. Maybe they could include a 'spare' pump with the unit, I can see this is not a rare situation."
5,Extroardinary quality for cheap,"I have a firewire-based home recording studio, where every single piece of my thousands of dollars of equipment has to feed through one 4-pin to 6-pin cable. Needless to say, if that cable is untrustworthy, the whole thing goes down in flames.The cable I had been using was dropping out of sync with the computer at random intervals, sometimes when I bumped it and sometimes when I was nowhere near it. So I bought this Monster cable to replace it, and have never looked back. It's worth investing a few more bucks in a firewire cable if you're using it for advanced applications like high sample rate audio recording. This cable is reliable, extremely well-built and high-quality, and has never let me down. I couldn't recommend it more highly."
5,DayStar Guide to Colleges for African American Students,This was the most comprehensive College guide I've ever seen. It gave me the ability to rate colleges in the areas that I felt were important to me. Both of my children used the book to make their decisions on which colleges they wanted to visit.
5,Best of the bunch,"I am a college recruiter who specializes in minority students. I have used all of the college guides targeted to minorities and this is the best one. It's comprehensive, clearly written and nicely organized. Five stars."
4,Stalin's Shadow,"Stalin's shadow remains cast over this production, even a half-century after his death. The producers and directors of ""A Journey of Dmitri Shostakovich"" were not interested in motives or continuity, so you will need to review the entire story of the American journey --- from at least two unbiased sources --- before you attempt to watch this remarkable, unique, one-of-a-kind fragment of history. Most valuable to me were the video captures of Shostakovich, footage I had never before seen. If you are interested in this unusual detail of Shostakovich's life, by all means buy the DVD, but you will be sometimes surprised and sometimes disappointed. I think it's worth the money for those who want to know more about the life of this Russian genius."
1,A Good Series- The Video Download is Not Working,"I, as a person, love this series. I bought the red vs blue recreation as an experiment to see how the Amazon Unbox works (its a amazon promoted program which holds your videos that have been downloaded). The video graphics are okay, I think that Amazon wanted to make sure they could give customers the video in the promised time. I have downloaded two other videos, and they both worked fine. This one has a problem with the fast forward, pause, and rewind buttons, as well as when you minimize the window, the next time you come back to the Amazon Unbox window, the screen is black and you have to rewind to the beginning to restart the video. If you are buying the DVD, I highly recommend it, But definitely not the Video Download."
3,"""Get Ready to get Simmonized!""","A little more action in this one, still have the funny lines, but i have one huge issue that i had to take away a star for. Lopez and his awful spanish. Did they use google translate for him? the translation is off, spanish grammar is bad and the accent is terrible. it has to be part of the movie because I doubt anyone would just let this slide on accident. other than that it is still a funny one."
5,good customer service,"I bought this for my son so as to the content of the dvd I cannot comment, except he seems to really like it. The customer service from amazon when ordering was great!"
2,Not consistent,"It wasn't a bad buy for the money, but it wasn't consistent. I'd do the same activities each day with a vastly different result, actual ex Monday 2147, Tuesday 180. I tested it at 10 paces. No problem. 100 paces. Came up with 87. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I couldn't figure it out."
2,Plastic belt clip broke within a month.,"Purchased on 5/26/10. Belt clip broke on 7/3/10. Amazon suggested purchase of leash which I bought, but leash was unnecessary as the pedometer came with one."
1,you get what you pay for,I wanted some cheap drill bits to do some light drilling but these bits were so dull (and some even crooked) that I couldnt even use them.

1,Not what I Expected,"These ""steel"" bits couldn't even stand up to thin aluminum. I broke two bits immeadiatly upon use. This deal was definitely to good to be true."
3,Some times you get what you pay for,"You know the saying you get what you pay for, well in this case it was true. The case is really cheap and the bits fall out of their places every time you open or close them and on top of that they aren't sharp at all. If you are doing drilling in soft wood, grout, or other soft material them they work great, but if you have to drill in hard wood or other hard material then they are crap."
