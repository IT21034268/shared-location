1,Misleading Advertisement!,"This is the second vendor I have seen selling this exact with a misleading advertisement. The entire page indicates you are buying a ""Box of 12"", but when you attempt to purchase one item, you get a singe pen.Be very careful of these types of vendors."
5,Simply Wonderful - Praising Him!,Go for it! This is great! You won't be disappointed! You'll enjoy singing these wonderful praises to the Lord Jesus Christ!
4,Great for the money,"This CD is filled with the songs that are sung in the contemporary church. Listening to it is a very uplifting experience. I just wish the singing was a little better, but it doesn't matter much since I am singing right along with them."
3,Great Songs,"These are great songs to listen to. Be aware, that these do not appear to be the original artists."
5,too 25 praise songs 2007,"good praise song cd. it wasn't the typical maranatha, huge band, couldn't hear the words cd. i could actually hear the words and the songs were performed in a great mellow style."
2,"Good for side salad, not what I expected","I purchased these because I eat a lot of salads as my main meal, but these bowls are to small for that. They are now used for soup that I have with my salad bowls my wife got at Michaels for like $6.00. Nice quality, just to hard to tell how big online."
5,A great carbon copy book for invoicing,I love this book for quick invoicing. The carbon copying is great. I use this product 4 days a week.
3,"Cute, but small","This work bench is smaller than I thought it would be. But, it is very durable and well-made. We got this for our 2 year old and he didn't really play with it much until he was closer to 3. It takes some dexterity to screw and use the vice."
5,Drakkar After Shave Balm,"I LOVE this scent on my husband. It smells great and is very cooling on the face. It's not abrasive or mediciny and especially, Not too over-the top with the cologne scent. It's the kind of scent that can be layered without having the scent walk into the room 5 minutes before the man does!!I don't know why the aftershave balm is so hard to find."
5,THE BEST LATIN ROCK CD EVER,"Even Clandestino (First Manu Chao's album) is not as good as MANO NEGRA's CASA BABYLON.Rock, dub, rap, dancehall, and latin all together in an album that has made history in europe. From the launching of this CD, there are an uncountable number of spanish and french groups that try to imitate this ""Babylon"" sound.Casa Babylon is an album that even today is being sold in spanish shops, it is the reference for what you can call ""latino rock"", but it is more than latino, even more than rock.For me it is one of the five best albums ever made. And I'm not kiddin'"
5,just great,"the language mix is just great, feel the tribal rhythm vibrating within yourself. Allow all your rebel instinct to explode in one loud outburst."
5,The best of the best,"I'm sure this the best Cd I have ever listen to, Open your mind and buy it, it's good for your health OK"
1,"Completely Useless ""Guide""","I got this book in the hopes of gaining ideas for promoting my own work...what a mistake. This is not a ""Guide"" at all, it is a collection of essays by writer's touting their respective books.Inside this book are numerous authors telling writers to promote their book on radio and television, sell it on the internet, get it reviewed...all good ideas--but not one of them gives any details on how to go about getting on television or radio, nor how to get a review.A guide should provide at least minimal instruction on how to go about promoting. This book is just a way for writers to promote their own book. Are their efforts at promotion successful? They may be, but I don't know what they've done since they all have kept it a secret.My recommendation: skip it and buy a book that details and provides instructions."
1,Slow,"This book should have been titled Yada Yada. If all the repeat and filler dialog were taken out, it would be a long short story. Once the desaparecidos were mentioned, it was pretty clear what the plot was. It's been used a gazillion times. Then the reader has to sit around for the last half of the book while the characters talk and talk and talk."
4,Another Grippando winner,"I have read most of Mr. GRIPPANDOS books and he never ceases to entertain with gripping suspense and intricate plots. The introduction of the blind officer - Vince - has put another breath of fresh air into his novels . Jack, Theo , and Vince ...can't wait for the next installment."
1,Boring,"Although written in a catchy prose, and having rhythm, the utter lack of interest of the storyline spoils this book.At most, it looks like a bad episode of ""CSI Miami"".All the resources of an action paperback are explored by Mr. Grippando: Throwing in some Latino stereotypes, police jargon, odd-couple tics, crime scene crudity, love story.But alas, those isolated resources, by themselves, don't make up for the utter inability of Mr. Grippando's narrative to stir your interest."
3,Impressed,"This was my first time to read Grippando, and I was quite impressed with it. The characters were colorful as well as likable. The plot twist from present day Miami to an era of one of Argentina's dirty secrets, decades back, is done well. In the future I look forward to reading more from Grippando."
4,4 1/2 stars,I think this is one of James Grippando's most compelling novels yet. Its fast pace and gripping plot makes it hard to put down. Mr. Grippando has that certain skill that pulls the reader into his stories. Fans of his will not be disappointed.Highly recommended.
5,Worth the money,"This video has several catchy songs that are all educational. For example: alphabet, colors, shapes, days of the week. It looks like it was made in the late 80s based on the outfits, but my 20 month old twins seem to like it. All the songs have a lot of kids doing things so I think that is what keeps their attention. I feel like it was worth the money."
1,very disappointed,"I bought this video for my 1.5 year old daughter who picks up things very quickly. She learned the names and sounds of the alphabet in less than a week from another product, so I wanted to find something that would help her to learn her colors, shapes, and numbers, but I do not see the method of this video being particularly educational. The numbers and colors do appear on the screen, sometimes erratically, while songs are being sung, but the connections do not seem explicit enough to me. This video is good if you want something simple and non-commercial, but I do not think it is all that educational. She has only seen it once, but wasn't that captivated by it anyway. It also seemed unprofessional and very dated. I have a background in developmental psychology and learning from Harvard."
2,Big disappointment :(,"Purchased this dvd based on the reviews on amazon and having the original baby song video. The original was great, this one...not so great. The title leads you to believe that it will teach your child to some degree the shapes, numbers etc..Not so, the songs touch on the learning angle briefly. The numbers go fast and the performances are quite dull to both my children. My 2 and my 4 year old get mildly entertained by this dvd, MILDLY. The color and shapes performances will not add much learning as they are light in content. At best, the tunes ""might"" entertain your child while you try to catch up around the house. MAYBE."
4,Good teaching movie,My 21/2 yr. old enjoyed the movie and repeated/imitated what was going on in the movie.
2,Boring,"I purchased this video for my daughter, 18 months, hoping she would learn her ABC's and 123 but this video could not catch her attention at all. She was really bored and wanted to watch something else."
1,A disappointment!,"I ordered this video for my daughter, age 2, after she showed an interest in the alphabet and numbers. The fact that this was a Parent's Choice led me to believe that it would be the perfect educational video. Was I wrong! The 2 songs that deal with the ABC's go by so fast that my daughter couldn't keep up. Don't even expect that this video will help you child learn numbers. The first counting song only repeated ""1-2-3"" over and over and the second just showed a little girl randomly counting to 5, 6, 7, and 8. The songs didn't even keep my daughters interest. All the video contains are songs that are boring to a 2 year old and seem like they would be trivial to a 5 year old."
2,did not like,I did not like this. I played it once and then gave it to a friend. It is for a BABY I was trying to help my 2 year old learn the ABC.s
5,4 grandchildren and I love this music.,"I bought the vhs tape when my first granddaughter was born in 2000. She would watch and listen in her swing and walker. Then we had 3 more grandchildren and now we needed the DVD for our 2 1/2 year old who loves the sticks song and the beanbag song which we do together. You won't be disappointed in the peppy music!Baby Songs - ABC, 123, Colors & Shapes"
5,Two year old will watch the entire show!,"My daughter, two, still does not watch a lot of tv. But in the car, she will be so quiet and watch without saying a word. Lots of signing and songs. Very cute."
3,Old Video with new package?,"This video seems very dated. My 17 month old prefers SINGING BABIES NURSERY RHYME TIME. The babies appear to sing the songs, which rivets him to the set. The auto repeat feature keeps the show going until some work around the house gets done. Yes! I think that Hap Palmer is good, but check out Singing Babies. You will thank me."
2,"It works, but I don't like it","Battery life seems very short. I only use Rechargables and maybe they just aren't for these lower power/long time items (unlike camera's), but I am annoyed at how often I need to change them.Also, the unit is heavy. Of course, this is because of the batteries, but I didn't realize how much lighter my replacement logitech wired optical mouse would be. I like it much much better.Only buy an cordless if you really need it, would be my advise."
2,Dont Bother,"After it working fine for about 2 months, It got to wet one day from the shower head leaking and the radio broke, the clock is broken as well and unable to reset to the correct time. Its a cute idea and the radio sounded crappy when it did work but for the price I expected it."
1,don't bother,I bought this just for the clock portion and it stopped displaying correctly just from the steam in the shower- it never even got splashed. The radio sounds horrible too and gets bad reception
5,Great for kids!,"My 4YO daughter loves this! She has had it since last Christmas, and colors on it periodically. The paper roll seems to go on forever. It is a great thing to bring along in the car. Just bring a little pillow to help prop it up. :)"
5,Meridan Satin,We had a smaller version of this set and enjoy the feel and balance of the utensils. Ordering was easy and the delivery was faster than promised.
2,Not the Item Described!,"This is a very good album and I'm glad to have it. I would give it four stars except for the fact that it's completely different from the description on Amazon. The Amazon description matches (except for the cover art) the classic album Jolie Mome: 1959 - 1963 on the Polydor label (originally published by Phillips). This is the definitive Juliette Greco album, and I was very happy to see that it was apparently back in print again.The album delivered by Amazon, on the other hand, is Jolie Mome (no dates) put out by a German firm Delta #1 and with a completely different song list."
4,JULIETTE SHINES,"For those with a taste for things truly French and their cafe music is just that, join the ranks of Jean Paul Sartre and others who admired this intelligent vocaliste. The sound is excellent, being recorded by German engineers. However, your ""street"" French gotta be good -- it's argot set to music. Contains one song about a penguin, another about an ant. Where else can one find such variety?"
2,Not very sturdy,"This was purchased as a gift. After receiving it, I almost sent it back. It may be telescoping, but seems very flimsy, the rod too thin and does not appear to be sturdy at all. Not sure if it will serve the purpose, or hold up well. It may work with marshmallows, but so will a long 'free' stick. I would not order it again."
4,"Meh, these are ok","The handle is beautiful, the telescoping feature is awesome, nice brass colored ring for storage. The fork metal is a little flimsy though. It reminds me of an old radio antenna. It will be fine for marshmellows and probably hotdogs, but I was hoping for something a litle heavier... the handles seem too nice for the forks! I am keeping them because they telescope and are easy to store, but I am still on the lookout."
4,Great modern-day Cajun music,"Fans of Louisiana cajun music will dig this, another fine album from this up-and-coming young ensemble. Heartfelt and lively, they bring new vigor to this old style... Lots of great French-language originals from fiddler Cedric Watson, too. Recommended!"
4,great cajun,"I don't have a lot of time for a long review. I heard cuts from this CD, Blues do Musicien, on NPR's American Routes with Rick Spitzer, and knew it was music I would love. I do. Great Energy!"
1,L' Ennui - DVD,"Martin a 40-something teacher has an affair with a girl half his age. There is plenty of sex and nudity (front & rear) in this move. I can't understand how a director could cast a plain, chubby young women in such a role. Any erotic value that this movie may have is taken away by how fat (chubby anyways) this girl is. This would have been a much better movie had the lead role been played by a younger and much more attractive (physically and sexually) girl. As you read the other reviews you need to determine for yourself if you want to waste your money on this one.Gatekeeper Reviews movies only for their sexual, violence and nudity content. There is no child nudity in this movie. Please read other reviews if you're interests lie elsewhere."
2,Overrated movie. Sand French doesn't make it cool,There's some sex in this movie. And there are people speaking French. But those two features alone don't make for great cinema. This is not a great movie.
3,A thought provoking film ...,"The plotine is basically about a philosophy professor,an unsympathethic womaniser who has the desire to do something with his life. He meets a young woman, who was a model for a painter, who died while they were having sex, he doesn't get along well with her yet he has this physical connection to her. His obsession with her and her inability to respond to him make him resort to violence, he wants to break up with her and yet he cannot. Can a person love and despise another at the same time? This film explores that premise and utilises a lot of gratuitous sex and nudity ... Overall, it was a thought provoking film and I would only recommend it to any fan of French Cinema."
4,bizarre bizarre,"What a strange movie! Prix Delluc 1998, a perfectly honorable artsy French prize, but it certainly spares you no graphic sex scene, nor the buttocks of Charles Berling (a favorite actor of mine)nor the bosoms of coy Sophie Guillemin. Sometime, you think you hit upon some deeply philosophical statement, and in the next scene you are wondering if you are watching a parody of the genre. Hilarious dialogue at times (without meaning to be, I am sure..), and hilarious situations, though I am sure it is not the moviemaker's intention to create mirth. All in all, great photography, beautiful colors, realistic bits of Paris's life, and fabulous acting. But would I recommend it to a friend without a certain sense of humor? Well...."
3,A good reference but could be better,"For me this book was a real let-down. It is well illustrated and obviously much research was done. However, I feel that it is a true shame that someone hasn't done a groundbreaking work on the Seaboard. To show what I mean, I point to ""The Western Maryland Railway in the Diesel Era"" as a comparison. In addition to high quality COLOR photographs, Diesel Era has chapter after chapter of thoroughly research text describing the operation and history of the WM. If someone would create a similar book on Seaboard it would sell like crazy..."
4,Decent overview of SCL,"This book is basically a summation of SCL operating divisions, motive power, and contains a roster of all locomotives immediately after the 1967 merger. Overall the book is good in terms of coverage, but the descriptions are some what vague and there is not a good idea of what kind of traffic moved over certain lines, how busy they were, and how those divisions fit into the overall SCL network.Good entry for a railroad that receives very little coverage."
5,Getting better with age!,"Even though several of the reviews say that these books are too young for any child over the age of 3, I disagree.We have 3 of these books (this one, I Spy Wheels, I Spy Letters) and my son, age 5, is still enjoying them, but in just a different way. We now play ""I Spy"" the traditional way with...""I Spy something that is yellow and floats."" And then I have to guess what he is talking about (i.e. boat). And then I do the same. We continue until we have described everything in each of the pages. Yes, it takes a long time to go through the books, but it is so wonderful for his critical thinking skills.Any now my 21 month old daughter gets to enjoy these books. They just don't wear out! One of the best gifts around!!"
4,Loads of fun finding stuff...for awhile,I got this as a gift for my nephew..I heard great things about it when he first got it (from his mom)..but after awhile I think the 'novelty' wore off. We have some of the I Spy books at home here and my kids (ages 5-8)enjoy them but have found all the things they ask for in the book all too quickly. The fun in the books lies within all the stuff that they don't ask you to find..that you find! After awhile I find the searching wears thin...a better recommendation: Where's Waldo? books! Definitely a better challenge! This one is good for the toddlers though!
3,Nice occasional book,"Book is super simple; Two ""I spy"" items per page. I wouldn't read it often because the thrill of 'finding' the item is lost when you can remember exactly where it is from day to day. My 20-month old has fun pointing to other items on the page and having me name them."
2,It is what the title says...LITTLE,"I love ISpy books... however, I had no idea how tiny this book actually was... was a little disappointed."
3,More of a toddler level than preschool,"These books have great pictures and I love the concept. Just a word of warning that even though it says it is a preschool level, they are VERY easy. My three year old does not find them a challenge at all. I would classify these as more of a toddler level book."
3,Small and Easy,"My 2 year old loves I Spy books. I bought 4 of the board books, since he can be a little hard on books. (That might be the understatement of the year.) These books are similar to their big brother, but they are so easy. It is difficult to hold his attention when there are only 2 objects to find on the page and they are very prominent. I was hoping for the I Spy book in just a smaller, more durable package. I mean, it makes sense that they would be easier, since board books are for younger kids. If your child had never done I Spy books before, this would be a fabulous introduction to the game of finding the hidden picture. But if they've been working on the ""big"" books, they'll likely be bored by these board books."
4,I-Spy Little Book,This book is ok but our 2 1/2 year old granddaughter prefers the large size I-Spy books. We still get enjoyment from the book and we recommend it.
3,Too Easy,"I got this book for my 4 1/2-year-old daughter to entertain her on an upcoming road trip, but it is way too easy for her. To be fair she has already played a lot of I Spy on the computer so she has had a lot of practice, but I needed something portable and since she can't read yet I can't get an I Spy book for older kids. We will see how my 16 month old twins boys like it in the upcoming months. It may just not be age appropriate for 4 1/2."
1,No longer the best,I've bought only Gold Toe Canterbury Over the Calf Socks for about 20 years. The last few times I've bought them I've been sorely disappointed. One pair was so thin I could see my skin through them. A sock in another pair developed a hole on the side of the ankle after wearing it two times. I'm now looking for another brand to buy. I've had problems with others as well. The quality of Gold Toe has gotten much worse over last 6 months to a year.
5,Sounds Silly,"Best sock in performance that I have ever tried. I buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed. No sagging, no defects. The only reason I toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use.One of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again. If they ever stopped making them, I would buy a 100 pairs just to know I would have them for my liftime.There...I actually wrote a review on socks!"
5,GREAT,"I HAD LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR OVER THE CALF SOCKS WITH NO LUCK, TILL I FOUND THEM ON AMAZON. TRIED ONE PACK FOR TEST TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE WHAT I DESIRED. PERFECT. WILL ORDER MORE NEXT TIME NOW THAT I KNOW THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT. PRICE, SHIPPING TIME AND QUALITY ARE GREAT."
4,Do you have big calves?,"I have pretty big calves and they have a hard time going past the calves and will start to droop. I may return and get a larger size, but not sure where the heel cup will land. I am 5'11"" with a size 11.5E shoe size (Allen Edmonds)"
2,"OK,but !!!!","3 pairs, 2 different lengths, so 1 pair long, 1 pair a little shorter & 1 pair of different lengths. to be fair it is not a great deal difference & they all work for boot socks, it's kinda like grandma knitted them."
5,The Best Socks,"Gold Toes socks are simply the best in the world.They last and last, and keep their shape. . . ."
1,"lousy sock, too expensive, VERY slow deliver, can't think of anything nice to say","not a good product, immediately shrunk, too expensive, took forever to get to me. overall representative of a failed business model."
2,"Not ""Over the calf"" as described","These are NOT Over the Calf as advertised in the desc. They barely go halfway past my calf, and when I try to pull them higher, they wind up sliding down until they become bunched up crew socks as I walk.I bought a similar product called ""Canterbury over the calf athletic sock"" last year, and those were TRUE OTC socks (almost reaching my knees), but unfortunately Amazon was out of black in that design.These should really be re-labeled ""mid calf"", as they are definitely not OVER the calf."
5,Trust me. These are good quality over-the-calf dress socks,"I like black over-the-calf dress socks that go completely over my calf and almost up to my knee. These sock stay up and don't fall down like some other socks that I have ordered. I sometimes like to carry things in my socks, e.g. part of a newspaper, etc. I learned to do that while in the Marine Corps. These are better than the last socks that I ordered. When I need to order more socks, I will defintely go on Amazon and order these socks again."
5,This is his first book of poetry.,"This slender pamphlet, published in 1974 by Cliff House Books, contains a selection of poems by Richard Milhous Nixon, compiled by Jack S. Margolis.From the first page: ""The material included in this collection originally appeared in The Watergate Transcripts, released by President Nixon. Each selection is reprinted in its entirety. No words have been added or omitted, and the punctuation has not been altered in any way.""Here is an example:TOGETHERWe are allIn itTogether.We takeA few shotsAndIt will be over.Don't worry.I wouldn'tWant to beOn the other sideRight now.If you are able to find a copy of this little book, you will not be disappointed."
3,Does its job well.,This product works well and as intended. I've had it about 6 months and the battery is still going strong.I don't have to try to find the pull chain in the dark any more. My only complaint is that it is a little thicker than it seems it had to be. It is very conspicuous on the wall.Jim
3,cool but not cool enough,"its a cool toy and it sounds pretty good. however for the price it's a little lacking. However this would be an option for someone that has a space saver or a laptop,"
1,Gypsy Snooze,"This CD has a lot of very positive, intelligently written reviews, and it's kind of hard for me to imagine that they're about the CD I bought, which is the oddest and least interesting take on Roma music I've ever heard. Roma musicians have always tended to take on some aspects of local music, and it's possible that's the case here (a couple of the cuts have some distant - very distant - similarity to klezmer music). Yet what the whole CD lacks is the vibrant energy and drive that characterizes all the Roma music I've heard before this limp, disorganized attempt. I suppose this CD can claim to be less ""commercial"" than some. It's probably representative of some regional Roma music, and there's some virtue to be found in that. As is often the case with things that are off the beaten path, however, there's sometimes a reason why the path went elsewhere."
4,Reviews::,""". . . it should be in any library with a reference collection of any size, and in any genealogy and heraldry and museum library.""--Library Journal (July 1965).The volumes are in French, but the information is stereotyped, and easily understood."
5,Important long poem,"I'm not reviewing the book itself, since much has already been written about 'A'. The volume itself a nice edition of the full poem, with notes and intro. The cover could be slightly more interesting, I suppose, but it's grown on me."
4,"Undiscovered gem. Found it in a good bookstore, hadn't seen it before. It is wide,wise, and massive,ambitious and also personal.","Found it in a good bookstore,hadn't seen it before. Decided to order it. It is wise,wise,massive,ambitious and personal. It Sings?"
5,A Very Good Book in a Great Series!,"I have been faithfully writing reviews on each the Dalziel and Pascoe series in order to try to get people interested in this great series. It's extremely well-written. amd the characterization is wonderful. This is the tenth book in the series, and one of the best. We get a first hand look at the life that coal miners and families of coal miners lead. Hill presents this life with compassion and humour. We see an epiphany for Ellie in this book as well. For those of you who don't know who she is - she is Pascoe's feminist wife. Dalziel is truly wonderful in this book. Big, bluff and oh so wise - not a man that is easily fooled. One of the the best police procedural series out there."
3,not quite what I had expected,"The medal looks nice, but unfortuantely it appears that it is hollow....it defintiely has a funny sound because of it!I wish I had known that before I ordered it."
3,comfortable fit,"I only recently began using the Gold-toe dress socks. I have found that these socks wear very well. I have diabetes and these socks hug my legs without cutting into them, something diabetics need to watch. Very comfortable to wear all day and evening."
2,Get them cheaper at Ross,I paid a pretty penny for these and then i realized that you can get packs of 3 Goldtoes from Ross for around $7-8. I won't say they were identical but they were pretty good for me.
5,Excellent about 19th C Russia,Herzen is skilled in observation and description of various social and individual types in Russia at a time of greatimportance for its future changes. And it's a pleasure to read.
4,"Hard to classify, but a very good read","""Fantasy Life"" crosses so many genre lines it's hard to say precisely what the book is. For the purposes of this review, I'm treating the book as a fantasy and encouraging people with young adult readers to consider it. A number of themes weave through the plot of this book: stewardship, conservation, coming of age and self acceptance--for both a mother and her child.Rusch writes about the Oregon I saw when we drove along the beaches there. It's a beautiful place, but a tough place. In spots, ""Fantasy Life"" also has a very strong gothic feel.Well worth a read for young and old alike."
3,not good for recovering addicts,"I am a License Chemical Dependency Counselor and I had been looking for an educational video (talking about the effects on the body due to drugs). This video has a lot of great information however, it was poorly put together. What I mean is if you're recovering from substance abuse you don't need to see a lot of images of people smoking pot, crushing cocaine, snorting crack/cocaine, or popping pills. I wish they had left a lot of those images out therefore I wouldn't have had to pause-fast forward thru a lot of the scenes for my group. Other than that a lot of great info."
2,Not what expected,I thought there would be more visuals of how the drugs affect the body but all it seemed to show was people getting high and enjoying being stoned. I bought to do an educational group but felt tis video just would make the teens go out and get high more. Not what I expected at all so returned it.
3,Not bad at this price.,Is this the best cordless out there? No.Are you paying for the best? No.The volume is a problem but otherwise this functions the way you would expect a phone to function at this price.
1,It just stopped working,I had it for about six months and was never impressed. The sound was consistently poor and the battery had a short life before needing recharge. After six months it stopped working altogether. It's the last AT&T product I buy for a long time.
1,the worst!,This is the worst phone I have ever purchased! The one you are talking to can hear you and there is no static - BUT - even turning the volume up all the way - it's extremely hard to hear them> I will never buy an AT&T phone again! I am now buying another Sony - I should have done this from the beginning.
4,Interesting not sure how relevent but a good read,"As a speaker Im interested in books on the topic and this is kind of that as it is for people before the public who want to get noticed and as the title says 'win the crowd'. The author details many of his techniques as a magician and he is obviously qualified to talk on the subject. I found the work pretty interesting, at time fascinating but for most of us not sure how relevent. If you're interested in the topic though it is worth taking the time to read."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"This book was highly recommended by a fellow magician friend of mine. But as I read it I kept thinking it was not for me. The recommendations were often ridiculous. I can see that they worked for him, and perhaps a select few, but I think many other books would prove to be a better tool for public speaking.Ex. He suggests slipping a coin into a loose pocket of scores of people you meet so you get used to breaking the bubble. I can see that working for a close up magician, but fail to see the relevance to most people.I look forward to rapidly reading the rest of the book so I can give it away and forget about it."
5,A Great Gift for Your Favorite Salesperson,"If you think books on selling are all about sleaze and snake oil, you'll find ""Win the Crowd"" a refreshing change. Cohen, ""The Millionaires' Magician,"" explains many of the secrets of his profession, in easy bites like ""How to Command a Room"" and ""Magic Words."" Yet ""Win the Crowd"" isn't gimmicky; I work with this select clientele too (I'm a high-end real-estate agent) and I appreciated a book that was full of well-thought-out tips and practical advice rather than cheap tricks. (Don't worry, there's plenty of magic and wonder too). A great holiday gift."
5,Deutsch Heute,"A classic in German language acquisition and for good reason. I used this myself over 20 years ago when learning German in college and now use it for instructing adult learners. The format has changed somewhat, but the content, exercises and practical nature of the lessons remain valuable, immediately useful, and succinct."
1,Deutsch Horrible,"Quite frankly, this book impedes learning and only generates frustration. The chapters begin immediately with new grammar and vocabulary words that have not been introduced, and the amount of material presented in each chapter is ridiculous. Furthermore, the exercises are less than helpful, and the web-activities for the book are harder than walking on water. Definitely two thumbs down for this one."
3,Good thing I understand French and Spanish,Awesome visual transfer. Awesome audio? Who knows? The English track is DTS-MA. Which means that if you have an inexpensive HTIB connected through optical input... you more than likely will not hear the exceptional and astoundingly awesome surround sound this film has to offer. Considering that only about 90 minutes of video including the documentary are included... they could have easily offered alternate Dolby Digital tracks in English. The French and Spanish tracks are presented in Dolby Digital 5.1.It took over a month to receive this title from Amazon with SuperSaver shipping... although it's unclear whether it was the USPS fault. Tracking showed it was shipped cross country back and forth before arriving.
1,Super Boring,"As true race fan, this was grossly disappointing. The movie only shows about 10 minutes of racing, the rest of boring behind the scenes stuff. I anticipated great sound as well, but that was stymied too. Terrible background music and Andretti's narration overrides any chance of quality sound. Save your $.. bucks, because this is not racing."

1,Alittle Dissappointed!,"The manufacture of the DVD boasted 2-Disc set with Special I-Max features.I ordered the package and received only on disc, re-ordered and got the same. The process took awhile (with no favorable result), but amazon took care of me, apologized, and refunded my money. Just installing a decent 7/1 system for my motorcoach, and hoping to use these disc's to test it, the disc I did receive did not impress me."
5,Great movies,"Love the movies, my favorite is Harum Scarum. It is a great price for 3 movies. Although I have had no issues with them I don't care for the double sided disc, I have had problems with that type of disc in the past. I wish you could buy all 3 titles separatley,or at least on separate disc."
5,True open wheel racing,IMAX brilliantIn-depth veiw on Indy cars good viewing On how Indy is completely different to F1 faster and all manual gearbox no flappy paddles true racing - one handed true skill10/10
5,Great look at modern ChampCar racing,"Ride in a 225mph ChampCar with Mario Andretti and follow his son Michael Andretti through the 1996 season. Wonderful filmwork and outstanding THX audio give you a great impression of the speed and excitment of these powerful, agile cars. The Making Of Super Speedway is a great addition to the film. Interactive chapter selections allow you to go to the movie or the making of documentary.Great for any autoracing fan. Be sure to turn up the sound!"
5,CART racing,"This is THE benchmark most realistic racing documentary/movie avalible at this time period! With motion and vibration corrected cameras mounted in the cars it gives you the ""I am driving it"" full on experience!! The picture and sound quality will blow your socks off into the next zip code!!! Watch the volume as the new audio codecs will stress your speakers to the limit and may even cause some speakers to say bye bye!! I feel that IMAX films are the state of the art for picture and sound quality (especially blu-ray titles).I will use this disc to demo my home theater to friends!"
5,Closest you'll get to being in the car without having to pay the (very expensive) price.,Watch in the widest screen and the best surround sound you can get. WOW! The additional story of the old and new cars coming together is great. The incar camera shots are amazing.
5,THE ONLY DVD I'D OWN,"I have thoroughly researched the topic and tried literally hundreds of DVD's. To date, this is the BEST at ""exercising"" your DD AC-3 5.1 (hopefully THX certified) Home Theatre. The story is interesting, the photography is outstanding, the cars are fast, and the sound is enveloping. I rent most of my DVD's... if I could only own 1 DVD it would be THIS!"
2,"QWell done, good, but dated","Bought this and watched - part of a Christmas present. It was very interesting and well done - but a pretty dated. Since current racers have in-car cameras, and the cars are dated in the film versus today, it lost much of the impact. But the Mario scenes were very good, and I thought the restoration of the old car was the best. Especially its running in the end. Short scewne but wonderful - ripping down the country road with leaves flying. This film was probably great on Imac when made - now sort of dull. And I am a real racing fan."
2,Lacking in IMAX feel,"This IMax movie left me with a empty feeling, having not fulfilled what I was looking for. The clips showing race was rare, I expected more time devoted to it. The movie was composed of too much dialoge and story and not enough racing. I wanted to see racing and only got about 10 minutes or so of that. I was very disappointed."
2,Give me VHS,"The documentary itself is fantastic. Just don't buy this particular disk set.One disk is the regular Super Speedway from IMAX, but in NTSC. I took NTSC since the PAL version is out of production. When I played it on my DVD player, I was shocked to see how fuzzy 480 NTSC lines are compared to PAL's 576.No matter, I thought, I bought the disk set for the HD version anyway. So I popped the disk in my PC thinking I can stream the WMV files through my media streamer at my home theater. Another shock as I realize that the WMV files are encrypted not with standard DRM, but with some proprietary technology.Why even bother releasing this? The NTSC version is worse than a good VHS and if you want to see the HD version the whole family must crowd behind my tiny 22"" Monitor and tinny PC speakers for 50 minutes.One very disappointed racing fan."
2,"Good price, but...","double sided disc?I don't know... I don't like the idea of those discs.They are bound to have more scratches, fingerprints and so on when you manipulate them.When you put the disc back in the case, you will leave marks on the disc, unless you wear cotton gloves or something.Apart from that, it's a GREAT deal, excellent price for 3 movies, if you don't already have them.I'd give it 5 stars if the set was for 3 discs, and not 2 (one being double-sided)Enjoy!:)"
5,Super Speedway DVD,As a life long racer I thoroughly enjoyed Super Speedway and am sure I will watch it many times in the future. If I ever get the chance to see it in IMAX I definitely will.
5,Great Home Theater Demo Disc,"This is a great disc to show off your home theater. Not only is the sound chest pounding, but the experience of riding in an Indy car is incredible on a really large screen. It is really a great comparision to show someone the video on a 36"" TV and then on a 100""+ screen from a projector. The difference is like night and day!"
1,Bad DVD,This DVD is very very very bad. Es un documental muy malo sobre la fabricacion y prueba de carros formula INDY 500. El sonido es bueno pero el documental muy fastidioso. La imagen en pantalla es en formato Standard no IMAX.
2,dont waste your money,This was the most boring DVD I own. Dont be fooled by the title and other reviews. If you want a DVD to show your system off DONT get this. Unless you want to spend the money for a 5 second clip of a cockpit shot. This DVD is filled with way to much fluff an not enough racing. If you want to see how a car body is carved and an engine is put toghether and even watch Mario Andretti walk around his yard with his pig. (yes pig.) by all means go ahead. Not worth the money for me.
1,Beware,Beware of buying this if your DVD player or computer does not play blue ray DVDs. Most older players and computers do not. I have not been able to watch this video on my computer.
5,The Ultimate Test of your home theater(A good video also)!!!,"If you spent a lot of money on a home theater(5.1 for the best sound), this is the reason why! The sound and picture are awesome! You can pause the movie and see the scratches in the paint on the car! You have to have a good subwofer for the ultimate effect, one that will shake the floor. This is a must for Dolby Digital and DVD."
5,An insight into indy car,"When you first look at the case two words stare at you Imax and THX, This film was originaly made for the Imax theatre, the dvd version is just as good, the image is awe-inspiring, every single detail jumps from the screen, and the THX sound is remarkable, this is an audio experience which will send your pulse racing, Both these elements put together in one film does not happen very often, but when it does it's an experience you will never forget. If you want to enjoy the thrills of driving an indy-car, or want to find out how an indy-car is made from start to finish, then do not hesitate go and buy one of the best documentarys ever made. You also get the making of super speedway which puts you behind the camera and shows just how much work and money has gone into making this film."
3,All-Clad Pizza,Disappointed that it included no instructions for using or cleaning. No recipes either. Nothing other than the pizza tray/stone and cutter.
3,Doesn't make pizza crisp,"This is beautiful product, but the main reason I got it was for pizza. When I cook pizza, the crust is very soft, not crispy like I like it. I don't know if that is how it is supposed to be, but that is not what I expected."
3,"Warning: Censored, 'cleaned-up' american DVD version","This is an adult movie, for adult audiences. A love affair between two strangers. A misunderstanding and a memory of what it could have been.I longed for this DVD and just received it from Amazon last week.But to my disappointment is was a CENSORED version, for the american audiences: Ten minutes were cut from the original european version! All the sexually explicit scenes were banned (true: the movie still keeps it's atmosphere).I never tought I was ordering a 'clean movies' version.I'd rather have ordered it from Amazon.fr (integral full-version, with english subtitles):-("
2,Good idea but Unsatisfying in the end,"There are other reviews here which describe the plot, so I won't repeat it. I found this a disappointing and unsatisfying film, for two reasons. First, I just didn't identify or empathise with the characters - I found them rather immature. Second, there are many unexplained things in the film, like who is interviewing them after their affair is over, and why. Also, why do they both place ads for a casual sex hookup, when they are both clearly sensitive people, not sex addict types? The atmosphere is very sad and melancholic, with no happy ending (but that's no bad thing). It's a great idea, exploring modern society where sex is easy to get but love is hard to find, but somehow this film is too swamped in melancholia, and the characters are too teenagerish, to make its point well. A shame. I know some people love it, but I didn't."
5,Super easy install,"I'm not very technically inclined when it comes to hardware, so I was a little nervous about installing more memory into my Compaq laptop. But boy was this easy! Within 5 minutes I had the thing installed and restarted my computer, now running at 192MB ram."
5,Why did I wait so long!?,"I was hesitant to order computer memory and upgrade my own computer, but it turned out to be very easy. The website guided me to the correct product, the ordering was easy thanks to Amazon, the product arrived on time and was exactly right, and the upgrade was easy to install. My computer now runs great and I can't believe I suffered with the slower speed for so long! I now plan to upgrade the memory on all of our systems."
2,"Sony/BMG Left Off "" Love Or Let Me Be Lonely""","This is a compilation CD of some of the Friends of Distinction's hits, namely GRAZING IN THE GRASS and GOING IN CIRCLES. Sony/BMG has a long line of hundreds of budget priced CD's that are basically a sampler of an artists hits and album cuts. In this case, the record company did not include LOVE OR LET ME BE LONELY, which is one of their 2 biggest hits. Unfortunately, it's a tactic that the record label uses so you have to buy the slightly more pricier BEST OF FRIENDS OF DISTINCTION , which is the better buy, as it has all their charted singles , plus liner notes. It's a real shame that Sony/BMG purposely left off this most essential song that should most definitely been included. As such, if you want a CD of this group's most essential songs, this one is missing one very big hit. Instead, the label chose to include some of their versions of songs that were hits by other groups, like ELI'S COMIN', OUT IN THE COUNTRY and NEW MOTHER NATURE."
5,Very Good Book,"When I purchased this novel, I had already decided that the book would be based on a series of rules that the author had created. To my surprise and pleasure this novel was cleverly written and the rules followed the storyline, not the other way around.Great book written by a Howard Alumnus."
4,Insight in medieval history,"The New Concise History shows a good view on the Medieval 'madness' in which thoudands and thousands of people wandered through Europe, disorganised, plundering and pillaging, without the organisational powers of the former Roman armies driven by religious fanatism. It also gives insight into the current situation of the Middle East. Once the christian knights of Europe were not far from the Jihad warriors of today...Wruthless, without compassion, murdering anyone that had not the Christian faith. Especially the Jews of Germany had to endur in the start of the Crusads....In so far af very good and readable book. The author does not use any difficult language, myself being from Holland, and it gives a very good oversight and insight into Europe around the year 1000..."
1,not objective,Good book if you throw objectivity away and look at history with a sentimental eye rather than a neutral mind. I was dissapointed in the way the book was written.
5,Concise yet Complete for Non-Scholars,"As one who is not a scholar of this period of history, but who wanted to learn more about the Crusades in this post 9-11 world, I found this book to be an excellent introduction. I like the fact that the author uses recent research to debunk the outdated and inaccurate version of the Crusades presented to us in a single paragraph in our high school history books. What they say about history is so true: The more that historians of integrity study a subject, especially as the years pass and new manuscripts and evidence come to light (as has occurred recently in the field of Crusade research) the more clear the events of the past become, and the better equipped historians are to accurately write about them.You will find it easy to read and a page turner. Enjoy!"
5,Excellent book,"Very informative. There seems to not be much information available concerning the Crusades, that is affordable and qualified as this book is. Excellent reading but not a ""picture book"" if you are looking only to view sculpture/artwork. This book is solely for the reader who is truly interested."
3,The good and bad,"The product was too small for my car - but that was more than likely my fault not the company. My problem was trying to return the product. It took too long for them to respond to my return request. It is now returned, but it took over 2 1/2 weeks from when I originally received the product and made a return inquiry to when they responded."
1,Trying My Best To Forget This Book,"Bette Ford, please do us serious and in-depth readers a huge favor...STOP WRITING BOOKS, until you have learned and perfected your craft.To say this book was ""stupid"" is an understatement.Characters underdeveloped, corny and dry dialogue, not enough imagery...I could go on for hours, but I'M not into boring people like the author did when she wrote this dumb story."
4,A sweet story this is!,"I really enjoyed this story and am now looking forward to reading more books by Bette Ford. Anna and Gavin have known each other for some time as he is the friend of her brother. In this story what starts as a business relationship - Anna, a caterer, provides meals for the ever busy pro football player Gavin - soon blossoms into a full fledge romance. Their relationship is beset with challenges thanks to Gavin's fear that he will end up as an irresponsible man and father just like dear ol' Dad and Anna's fear of becoming involved with someone so close to her family. They navigate the challenges that arise from their fears and interference from Anna's protective brothers and father and intrusions by Gavin's irresponsible Dad.Navigating the path with them is delightful, intriguing and attention-holding due to Ms. Ford's wonderful storytelling.You'll definitely enjoy it."
4,Sweet story with spice!,"Very entertaining read. I like emotional books with family problems as the subplots.SPOILER AHEAD: The second book I've read this year about a 27-year-old virgin, and while I hope this isn't a trend this was nonetheless an enjoyable story. At least the author tips off the reader before the big moment. In the other book I read I felt cheated to find out during the big scene that it was her first time. (I never did finish that book.)"
1,A disappointment,"I didn't expect a lot from this cd and I must admit my expectations were more than met. I ordered mostly for historical reasons, to sample one of the earliest popularlizers of salsa in the United States. The price was a warning, and I knew it and accepted it. I don't feel cheated, but I'm reviewing it just to inform potential buyers. The sound quality is like one of those historical folk recordings some anthropologist made using equipment in the trunk of his car. I think it's actually monaural. I shouldn't carp about the music itself, because it is what it is. But it is not authentic early Cuban salsa: it's been made cute for a (possibly resistant?) American audience and market. The music historian might not mind this, but as a salsa fan I found it way too saccharine. Also there are no liner notes. The cheesy, PhotoShopped cover picture sets the tone. Let the buyer be informed."
4,alyias kitty,i give this tv a 4 .the price is really high for a 13inch but over all the picture is nice and clear.
1,Men's Capris??,These are great if you don't care that you look like an idiot. My husband bought these and expected them to zip off to shorts. Instead they become Man-Capris!!
5,Got the job done....,"Was originally looking for a specific toyota tool, but found this. Was skeptical at first but ordered it with 2 day shipping. Arrived next day and was exactly what I needed."
4,Good versaitile tool with additional uses...,"I'm impressed with this tool. It has 10mm holes at the end of the ""fork."" That means it can be used to hold the 8 and 6 mm bolts on the crankshaft pulleys on Mazda, Mitsubishi, and certain Volvo engines, while you're removing and tightening the cranckshaft center bolt. That's a plus making it more versatile than its original design purpose, which it can also do.The only thing that I would do to improve it is to use a ""prevailing torque"" lock nut or at the very least, a nylon lock nut on the center joint rather than just a serrated flange ""whiz"" nut. I used red thread locking compound on the nut to keep it from being lost, tightening it enough and locking it in place just tight enough to hold it in place, but still allowing the moveable to be swung with a light force.Overall, I am satisfied with this tool. The factory authorized specialty tool would be more expensive."
2,A Real Lunatic,"Although some stories are uplifting they tend to take on a ""Woe is me"" kind of attitude. It amazes me how some people can be so self righteous at times."
3,How to stay upbeat and not BE beat,It is incredible to see how this mother keeps up the stamina and stays cheerful in the face of life threatening diseases of her child and husband and herself. I feel that she really needed to write this book as it was therapy for her and she will continue to stay relatively happy by getting it all off her chest. It should be encouraging to others to not feel alone and lost.
1,Please tell the publishers to price more appropriately.,"Because I am not going to pay twice what I paid initially to re-purchase half the book: I own the paperback Alan/Grant format, and love both stories, but sorry, guys, not going to overpay for the convenience of the digital format."
2,Good Story -- way over priced,"I like the story a lot, but the publishers are really stretching things with the way they are pricing what is basically half of a book. This was published as part of a two book set -- this is way too expensive for an electronic copy of such an old book."
3,Very Delicate,"I bought this as a Christmas gift. It is very high quality, but I do have to say I'm a bit disapointed that it's so thin and delicate. It should be okay, as it's a gift for someone who endulges in some very expensive wine. Personally, I would have no use for it... but I drink boxed wine. LOL"
3,received broken,"i received this item quickly, but one of the glasses came broken. I didn't want to send it back, b/c i was afraid of time restrictions, but other than that it was a pretty set"
1,"Seriously, seriously awful","This must be the worst product I have ever recieved from Amazon. I cannot believe this was nearly $40! I could have gotten this from a dollar store somewhere! Very, very disappointed. This was supposed to be a gift for my father, and I would never give this to him!"
1,just awful. not happy at all,"Terrible! Ordered this as a wedding gift. The Decanter looks like a chemistry beaker with pegs on it and the glass is so thin I was afraid it would break before we even got it to them. And the glasses are a neat concept, but are only slightly bigger than shot glasses. TOTAL waste of money! Had to go buy something else last minuet. Save your money and buy something else"
3,Okay. but not what I expected.,"The walls are very thin and delicate. Some of the glasses had small scratches on the outside. The overall shape of the glasses is not at all what is shown in the picture. The feet are angled forward in the picture, but they are actually vertical making the glasses less stable. The bends on the stem in the picture are a very nice wide S-shape, but the glasses I received basically bend straight up then out, no smooth transitions as in the picture. The bowl part of the glass is basically champagne style, having nearly the same width from top to bottom. Overall the glasses are still okay but as this was a gift I was hoping they'd be as dynamic as in the picture. The decanter is as pictured and also nervously delicate."
3,Very small glasses.,Glasses are tiny. I should have read the description closer. More like shot glasses. Wish the picture had a person holding the glass for size reference.
2,Unfortunately botched transfers of interesting material...,"I am so frustrated every time I attempt to listen to this CD. It could have been so wonderful, if only the transfer engineer and producer had listened to what they produced before issuing it! More than half of the songs suffer from what appears to be a botched application of noise reduction technology, with sudden shifts in ambient noise between vocal and non-vocal sections, and distracting whistles and high-frequency noise which most likely have arisen from noise reduction software application gone awry.Such a shame, as the songs, all compositions of dance band-leader extraordinaire Isham Jones, are great, and the original recordings themselves quite good (with emphasis on post-1930 recordings). An honest unfiltered transfer from clean original 78s in excellent condition would have been infinitely preferable. One can only hope that the issuing company will redo the transfers and reissue this CD as soon as possible."
2,"Lots of Evil, No theory!","If you are looking for a ""theory of evil"", which is what the book promises in the title, forget about it: it's not here. That's not to say that Oppenheimer's discursive review of a whole lot of films is not enlightening, it's just that he just never brings it home.More than that, the prose is uneven; sometimes it is quite engaging, other times it is choppy and so obscure as to leave the reader saying ""say WHAT?!""The high point of the book, I think, is his discussion of evil vis a vis language. That is a worthy observation.If you want a serious, scientific, theory of evil, read [ASIN:1897244258 Political Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes)]]."
3,She Has Done Better,"She is a great player in the American style, but this was only her first recording. She has moved on to bigger and better recordings, such as the Krommer and LeBrun albums, which I have rated as 5 stars.This recording was designed to show off Nancy's technique, rather than be a coherent listening experience."
1,Don't bother,"I read this book traveling one weekend and found it to be one one of the worst books I have ever read. Evans does nothing to develop the character potential, and the ending was contrived and sappy. Skip this one."
2,Blah Blah Blah!!,"The book started out great and I thought I would really get into it, but it took a sudden turn south! Smoke jumper?? I thought I would be reading a book about Smoke Jumpers and lost love etc etc, but when Conner went on his venture to far off lands...it lost me and lost my interest. He tends to ramble on and on and on!!!! It is taking everything in me to try to get through the last 50 pages!! Acckkkk...what happened???Im definately not impressed with this book at all. If Nicholas Evans would have stuck with the original storyline, it would have been a great book....what a bummer for us readers who wasted our time!!"
2,not up to par with The Loop and Horse Whisperer,"After reading The Horse Whisperer and The Loop, I looked forward to another read by Evans. But this one was a disappointment. It was predictable,(from a romance novel standpoint), and hokey,(two men who are best friends hopelessly in love with the same woman). Please!One thing I loved about the other two books was the realism about real life relationships. The actual smoke jumping part was pretty good, but that occupies only a small part of the novel. About half of it takes place in Africa with the main character, Connor, trying to do good deeds. But the ending was so Lassie-come-homish. Thumbs down!"
3,What was that about?,"I'm am left somewhere between disappointed and confused by Nicholas Evans' latest, THE SMOKE JUMPER. The far-from-original love triangle between two best friends and one girlfriend actually held some promise for the first half of the novel. This was a nearly complete story filled with enough Montana imagery, longing romance and quick-draw dialogue that I've come to expect from the author. Even the predictible tragedy managed to hold my attention. That is, until the novel went south -- almost literally. I struggled with the second half of this book as the story transports the main characters to far off places, each on their own personal journey to better the world. It was suddenly THE SMOKE JUMPER OUT OF AFRICA. I nearly had to turn back to the cover to make sure I was reading the same novel. All in all, though, THE SMOKE JUMPER managed to keep my interest to some degree and still warrant a decent review -- if only because of the first 150 pages."
2,The Smoke Jumper,"It's clear that Nicholas Evans has a love affair with MT, especially the very cool town of Missoula, but this book is disappointing if you were expecting it to be about smokejumpers and was pretty ""hokey"" and predictable. It's a romance novel."
2,Should have jumped long before finishing this book.,"I have just finished this book and was gravely disappointed (though not surprised at all) at the outcome. Any intelligent reader would have the end figured out after the first section, if not sooner. What a shame that the two most lively characters in the story suffer untimely demises leaving the book dry and cold reading.The author also has a bad habit of running off in many directions leading the reader down a very boring path. This book could have, and most definitely should have, been at least 125 pages shorter.The only reason why I continued to read was because I wanted to prove my original hypothesis correct (and I did). It's such a shame that two characters (Julia & Connor) didn't perish in the many, many occasions they ""stumbled"" into together.One could only hope they don't make this into a movie."
4,I loved it!,"After reading several of the customer reviews for THE SMOKE JUMPER, admittedly, I have to agree that yes, at times the novel was predictable, and that the Montana storyline was definitely the more interesting part of the book. With that being said, the one thing I did notice, even with all the negative comments by other readers, was that everyone who read THE SMOKE JUMPER finished it.Nicholas Evans is a natural storyteller. With unassuming and graceful prose, convincing dialogue and fully realized characters, THE SMOKE JUMPER is an old-fashioned tear-jerker, a highly readable and captivating story about friendship, love, loyalty, guilt and honor. Despite some of the book's inevitabilities, THE SMOKE JUMPER is a lovely story and an enjoyable read."
2,Smoke Jumpers go to Africa???,"Like a lot of other people, I very much enjoyed Horse Whispers and the Loop. They both had a good story, connected to animals and nature in a way that I very much enjoyed. This story started out fine, and I enjoyed learning about smoke jumpers and the horrible effects of forest fires on our enviornment. Good, I thought, another good story that keeps the nature/animal theme alive. Then the book went to Africa. After that, the whole thing fell apart. Only the first half of the book was about smoke jumpers, and the rest seemed like filler. It is not one of the worst books I have ever read, but I expected more from this author."
2,Have I read it before?,"I didn't entirely dislike the book, but I kept thinking I'd read it before by Nevada Barr, Elmore Leonard (Pagan Babies), and John Irving (Cider House Rules). The stories weren't exactly alike so there wasn't any plagarism, but the various thoughts were somewhat the same - forest fire fighters, Glacier Nat'l. Park, African atrocities and the love triangle. They all made fairly good books."
1,Kindle?,"I haven't read this yet, hence the low rating. If it's not sold in Kindle regretfully I won't be reading it either. I've requested it several times now."
1,Where are you on Kindle?!,"I requested this over and over again to be available on Kindle. Until then you won't get a good review from me!Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, U.S. Wireless)"
1,Foul language,"I had to give this book one star because that is the lowest rating you can give other wise it would have been zero. I was recommended this book by Amazon.com, recomendations based on my previous purchases mainly books by Nicholas Sparks. I rented this book from the library, read about five pages and was so turned off by the foul language- that is in every sentence or every other word. This book is going back to the library the same day it was borrowed. It was voted one of Amazon.com best of 2001. Well, we all know what horrible things came that year, based on this book recomendation the ""Best of the Best list"" was no different."
1,Sappy pre-teen romance,"I started reading this expecting an exciting tale of the Smoke Jumpers, fire fighting tactics, and adventure. What I got was a sappy pre-teen romance soap opera that resembles a Harlequin romance. The female lead is in love with both male leads, creating a Melrose Place plotline that got so ridiculous that I put the book down, never to take it up again. Stay clear of this one!"
1,Smoke Jumper Nicholas Evens,I would like to have all his (Nicholas Evens) books on Kindle's So I can read it over and over again. That is what I want.
3,Made for TV,"Hot fire fighters, a love triangle, and Montana. I've never read a book with quite this mix before, but it worked in it's own way. Even though some parts seemed a bit far fetched, I couldn't stop reading. If there was a ""made for TV"" genre of books, this would fit right in."
5,smoke jumper by nicholas evans,"Loved It, love the idea of forbiden love and the fact that they were able to come together in the end."
4,Great start but then...,"The first half of this book is great but it soon starts to turn into fairly standard guy-loves-girl-loves-guy book and then gets totally unbelievable. Even so, it is an enjoyable read, just a little disappointing because it had such potential."
1,Predictable and Awful,"This book was predicable, sappy and awful. I knew exactly what was going to happen next. I have read all his books and the Loop is the the one I enjoyed the most. I live in Montana and enjoyed reading about places I have been but, the characters were spinless and there was no reason to like them. The writing had no continuity and you wonder if perhaps you are reading a couple of different books. So, save yourself some time and money and skip this book."
1,Boring.,"This was one of the most boring, disjointed books I've ever read. One would have thought that a book titled ""The Smoke Jumper"" might have been about firefighters or forest fires or something along those lines. Instead it's about every random thought that jumps into the author's head."
1,What a disappointment!!,I had so looked forward to reading Smoke Jumper based on my enjoyment of Evans' other books...i.e. The Loop and The Horse Whisperer. I was surprised and disappointed when I got into the story. The story line came across so contrived it was hard to imagine Evans putting out such work. The characters were so heroic they were totally unbelievable. I scanned the last 100 pages mainly to see if what I had already figured out would actually happen. And....it did.
2,Very poorly written,"I wrote a review when the book first came out, but it was somehow never posted. Simply stated, this is a very poorly written book. Some of his descriptive passages were quite nice, as were his use of simple language to express the power of a scene. However, the character development is shallow, the plot line implausible though predictible, and the romantic relationships boring. Using a striking visual image at the beginning of the book, it quickly loses momentum until it is simple drudgery to read after 50 pages. Do not waste your time or money on this book. It did not last long in the bookstores, and is best forgotten."
4,an enjoyable journey,"I thought this story started off a little disjointed, but it comes together, as do all of the characters in an exciting story. I think Evans writes in a way that we can clearly see where the settings take place in his story. I feel I was in Montana with Ed, Julia, and Conner, and I also feel that I was with Julia and Conner in Africa. I was immersed in this story, and I have come away from his book with vivid pictures in my mind. I read the Horse Whisperer which I loved, and now I love this book as well. I now have to read The Loop."
1,If you like bad books...,"I got this book in hardcover as a gift. I will admit that I had never read this author before, but if this the type of contemporary novel that tops best seller lists, then I fear for the reading public.The novel centers around three young charcters and their fantastic, overly simplified, romantic lives. Each scene seemed ready for translation into film. Every minor character was written as a stereotype. Despite that this book is 400 pages long, it could easily fit into 2 hrs of movie-viewing. And it will.This book made me nauseous. Enjoy!"
4,Predictable yet enticing,"The Smoke Jumper is one of those books that is predictable yet you enjoy the predictability of it. You know what's going to happen when you flip the page yet the way that Nicholas Evans tells it is incredible. The way he is able to tell this age old tale of a love triangle pulls you in and gives you a real intimate look at the characters. You feel their pain, sorrow and joy and the journey from beginning to end. It seems as if it is a lifetime although this isn't a bad thing here though as it just accentuates the end. It helps you to empathise with Connor and Julia at the end because you seem to understand how they got there and the path and obstacles that made that moment even more special. Overall, even with its predictability, if you're into these kinds of romance books by authors like Evans (ie. Nicholas Sparks) you would enjoy this one."
5,Keep the kleenex handy,"In ""The Smoke Jumper,"" Nicholas Evans has presented with all the phases and facets of ""LOVE."" This narrative is captivating and while keeping you on the edge of your seat with a tissue handy as you read through the pages, ""The Smoke Jumper"" leaves you with the feeling of completion. Although you may not agree with the characters' choices you will understand and eventually applaud the courage pictured by this talented story teller. Another Evan's bestseller.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
2,Too sappy,"A good read for a 14 y/o girl. Way too predictable. The first 1/3 is not bad, after that it's increasingly boring. Light years away from the ""Horse Whisperer"", and miles - from ""The Loop"""
4,"Evans ""Jumps"" to a New High!",Nicholas Evans' first two books were unique in their drama. His third book The Smoke Jumper has all but established him as one of the best storytellers around. The spine tingling path of three people in this new episode will leave you wanting more. Evans has a wonderful way of painting pictures with his words and places you in the middle. The Smoke Jumper is a must-read for its story of those who dream of more and don't always get it. It's a beautiful rendition of a love story gone awry...
4,good read,"Having read some reviews prior to reading the Smoke Jumper I was prepared for the worst. Lucky we all have different tastes, how boring if we all thought the same because I enjoyed Nicholas Evans latest tale.The Smoke Jumper certainly holds up with the best for a good portion of the book. The relationship between Ed, Julia and Connor is one of true friendship and the difficulties they all faced and how they dealt with them after the fire was truely sad.Connor's exploits after were a little disjointed, or should I say the telling of them didn't sit well. But, this was a life story by Nicholas Evans and life doesn't flow along evenly either.Yes, parts of the african theme weren't needed but then it's part of this story.Overall, a good read by Nicholas Evans. Yes! I have to say a worthwhile read."
2,Not quite,"Unhappily, these characters just seem ""too cute"" for me tobelieve or become interested in. The whole atmosphere ofthis book seems highly artificial, and it is difficult toget interested in the story or the characters."
3,Good Story But Very Predictable,"Disapointed by the revelation that the tite has no revelance to the story other than the first several chapters, this book was not what it seemed. Although a good overall story, most of the major events were predictable. If you are interested in fire fighting and smoke jumping I would not reccomend this book. If, however, you enjoy a action / love story with a positive message this book fits the bill."
4,Inspired by the Video Age,"The Truman show is a 24/7 TV show, starring Truman. Problem is he does not know it. He was adopted by a TV producer from about 1 or 2 months of age, and from that time they created a town in a bubble and aired his ""artificial"" life as a TV show. There are those on the outside who think it is unethical and attempt to get inside and warn Truman. Excellent concept. Excellent story. You develop a fondness for Truman, and want to see him come to reality. This is the first performance by Jim Carey that was Oscar worthy."
4,JUST SHY OF A FIVE,"I loved this movie even though it was arguably quite sad. Very telling sort of reflection of our society. Jim Carrey was very good as Truman Burbank, a product of the media. He was adopted by a corporation and reared by actors on a ""Truman Show"" set. While the whole world watched his every move, he was oblivious to the fact that the entire world around him was artificial and the people in his life were acting roles. Once he does become ""liberated"" the viewer cannot help but feel afraid for him, having been so sheltered all his life. All the actors here are excellent. Laura Linney delivers a great performance as Truman's wife, Ed Harris plays the ""all-knowing"", artsy director in a beret perfectly, and Jim Carrey is the real surprise. His performance was outstanding, and although many would claim that this was just a subdued version of previous characters he has played, this was not rambunctious, out of control comedy. This was a real story with really thought provoking ideas."
3,"Paramount screws up again, but Truman still shines","Paramount is consistently putting out the WORST DVDs. Truman Show is one of the most incredible movies ever -- every time I watch it I get a little more out of it. Unfortunately Paramount just does not seem to know how to make a quality DVD. Not only does this movie have no extras, and is not in wide screen as promised... but the transfer itself it very poor. The picture quality is very bad for a DVD. I am not sure who is running the show at Paramount but they should be fired for screwing up a masterpiece like The Truman Show."
4,Comes oh so close to making a profound social commentary,"Perhaps we can triangulate between The Truman Show, Pleasantville, and The Matrix and get the movie that truly captures the age we live in. As moviegoers and as a society, we are searching for utopic transcendence, or at least the hope that it still exists. We want the life we've been promised, and if we can't have it, we settle for voyeuristic experiences of it. The Truman Show reveals our collective desires of living an idealized life, one which we are willing to give up individual autonomy to achieve. What is important to understand about The Truman Show and Pleasantville, is that we all think we want that life and our hegemonic culture industries are confecting it for us. The New World Order is in a Disney mode."
5,AWSOME,"For a some time I have been disappointed with most of Hollywood's big budget, action exhausting films that seem to have very little in the way of a plot. This film supersedes them all. Peter Weir again succeeded in transforming us to a world of interest, imagination, and thought. It was not only entertaining but also left you with a feeling of hope and the power of one man. Imagine my surprise when I found that the last film that I enjoyed this well, Gattaca, had the same screenplay writer, Andrew Niccol. Thumbs up to Jim Carry who also showed us a little of his dramatic talent in The Mask. For a film connoisseur like myself this was truly a feast. A must for my video library."
4,Good movie,"So... how would you like to be a reality TV star? I mean, REALITY! This is the premise of the 'Truman Show', which follows Truman since his birth, only he is not aware of the fact that he is the most-watched TV show in the world. However, he gets little hints that things are not as perfect as they seem, and must put the pieces together and attempt to take charge of his life. Good movie, and Jim Carrey did a good job as Truman."
5,One less item on my Blu-ray list.,I have always liked this movie because of the story and the actors. When I saw it was on Blu-ray I wanted to add it to my Blu-ray collection.
5,loved it,Great movie - finally something that's not just your typical boy-meets-girl or conflict plot line. Jim Carrey is great in this one.
5,Simply Brilliant,"Jim Carrey's first staring role in a drama was wonderful. He has successfully made the transition from goof-ball comic to serious actor. It's great to see a well thought out and original story made into a movie. Ed Harris does a remarkable job as Christof and Peter Weir's amazing camera work, including the odd ""hidden camera"" angles are enough to please any film student. One of the best films of the year!"
2,Its not Jim Carrey.,I was really surprised when i saw that the average was 4.5 stars after 396 reviews. I didnt like this movie at all and im a big fan of JC but it wasnt JC the plot was somewhat interesting but besides that it was pretty boring.
2,AN INSULT TO MY INTELLIGENCE,"The Amazon.com review calls it ""intriguing and touching."" Leonard Maltin calls it a ""satire of our voyeuristic, consumer-driven society."" Why have sophisticated film critics taken this annoying, bizarre, sophmoric film so seriously? I found this movie so blatantly and unintentionally contrived, it made me sick to watch it. The characters and performances turned me off more than those of any other movie I've seen (with the exception of The English Patient), especially the actress who played Truman's nurse wife (she has a very unnatural, annoying screen presence). Jim Carrey's trademark comedic attributes seemed completely stifled--a huge waste of talent.I think this movie would have worked much better as a black comedy rather than a hokey melodramatic satire that took itself MUCH too seriously. Peter Weir should stick to directing drama. Maybe someday he'll replicate another Witness."
2,just plain boring,"Yeah, there were some funny parts here and there. Throughout the whole movie I kept wondering something good is going to come up soon, but boy was I wrong. The ending was the worst. It was a major let down. But don't get me wrong, Jim Carey was a great actor."
2,Very hyped and not delivery the goods,I was sadly let down by this movie. After all the hype - I found way too many faults to enjoy it. The fact that he was such an incredibly dull person - that did the same thing everyday - amazed me that people would bother watching him for one hour let alone his whole life! He would also have to have been the dumbest person ever to walk this earth - only waking up to strange events when he's in his late 30's! Peter Weir is a brilliant director - 'Gallipoli' being a superb movie and 'Dead Poets Society' a true credit to him and Robin Williams. The Truman Show was a complete disappointment!
4,Jim Carrey at its best,"And in case I don't see ya: Good afternoon, good evening and good night. This movie is sometimes very funny because of the great acting Jim Carrey but the whole content of the story has got a bad mood. The fact that a person is supervised all his life is horrible. But for the spectators Truman becomes part of their life. It's amazing to see that a movie star can become part of a person's life. Everything in Truman's life is fiction and everybody is an actor.Perhaps one of the best movies which combines seriousness and fun."
3,Boring and overplayed,"What more? Better Carry - Liar Liar, Man on the Moon (check). Same idea, better visuals, better acting - Dark City (check). Better story, WYSIWWG (what you see is what we got) feeling - Brazil (check). Extremely overrated."
5,BEST MOVIE OF 98!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Truman Show was a masterpiece showing Jim Carrey's funny and serious side, yet keeping the movie in a serious manner the whole way through. I believe he and Ed Harris should get awarded for their excellent performance."
3,Great premise...never quite goes all the way.,"The whole idea for this movie is great and it is very well done...to a point. But once Truman finally figures out what is going on, just when you think the creative genius of Jim Carey will explode, nothing happens. The second half of the movie is slow and basically uninspiring. It's a real shame because it could have been quite a masterpiece."
2,If you are looking for tpyical Jim Carey FORGET IT!,"I didn't really care for this movie. I got lost in the story and actually fell asleep. It was a bit creepy to realize that your whole life can be on film but I would rather watch ""DUMB AND DUMBER"" OR ""LIAR-LIAR"" ANY DAY!"
2,"It was okay, But EdTV was much beter.","If you liked this one, then EDTV should be a logical follow up. I liked the idea of this movie, but I think that Jim Carrey was a poor choice for the main character."
1,What a big disappointment!!!,"What a letdown. This movie could have been so great. All that talent & all we get is a watered down mediocre twilight zone/ silly sitcom morph. There were so many opportunities for Peter Weir to go over the top, to be really imaginative & mind-stretching, but what we get is so totally boring & predictable (by a 5 year old child at that). I'm surprised they didn't cast Tom Arnold as Truman. A total waste of time & talent!!!"
5,Used with my class,"I used this with my Senior Modern Literature class after reading, ""The Stranger."" We used it to compare existential ideals. It worked really well!"
5,"Gets better, and truer, as the years go by!","One of the few movies that improve with age. I loved it when it first came out and I'm buying it again to keep and never resell. I'm surprised you don't hear more about this movie as it appeared right before the outbreak (like a rash or virus) of TV reality shows so it has a new relevance now. But Truman is about more than just that--it is about what everybody's life is becoming. And best of all it shows that Jim Carrey had the potential, sadly wasted, of becoming a fine actor under the control of a director the caliber of Peter Weir. I can watch this movie or and over--and frequently do!"
5,take me to Fiji,"For me, to really like a movie, a book, or anything like that I have to relate to a character and his experiences. Well, I perfectly related to Truman, even though I do not live my life on a television show. Do I? Anyway, Truman Burbank could be any of us. He's just the average Joe on the street, but he feels mysteriously isolated, so he goes off, on what could be considered a mid-life crisis, and searches for the truth of his existence. I mean, if we can't relate to isolation and curiosity about existence then maybe we could related his daily goings, or we could go out more. I know that Truman's world is made up of cameras and lights, unbeknownst to Truman, but even though he is living on a man made TV set, his life is just that common journey of trying to find out who we really are on the inside. Like I said, I completely related, I'm on my own personal soul search, and due to that connection I loved it. Oh and did I mention that it just really is a great movie."
5,Absolutely brilliant! Jum Carrey is Oscar worthy!,"One of the best movies ever made. a brilliant commentary on the state of our consumersist society that has placed the media at its center. Effective, becuase it criticizes both the Televison industry at the society that helps suppport it by watching anything. I teach a college English course, and I use this movie in my class to help teach the hidden messages of pop culture. Plus, you get to see proof that Jim Carrey is one of the country's finest actors. A breakthrough film."
5,This was the most imaginative movie released in a long time.,"I loved this movie. It was full of energy, comedy, romance, adventure and a lot more. It was a wonderful and imaginative concept to show someone unknowingly on television for his whole life but he's the only one who doesn't know. The acting was great and the production was just as spectacular. Everyone that worked on this movie should be very proud. My only disappointment was that there were not any awards given to the show. I haven't seen such an original concept presented so well in a very long time. I believe everyone that worked on this film deserves a big HOORAY!! Thanks for a great film."
3,Clean easy-to-watch film not spectactular,"Why all the hype? A unique film idea that doesn't come close to living up to its potential as a thought-provoking philosophical movie or as a comedy, it really never captured my imagination. I was disappointed after hearing so much about it. Carrey does a great job, but his supporting cast (as much as I love Ed Harris, he may have been a bit overdone with emotion at the end for my) doesn't quite step up to the plate with juicy parts that draw out the complexity this theme promised. Its still good entertainment, don't get me wrong, but don't believe the hype."
4,Almost a five,"I thought the movie was something for all ages. It put you up and then down again. With a little touch of suspense plus the great acting by Jim Carrey. All in all it was a great movie, but there could have been more at the ending. Like a final kiss from the girl he lost."
4,"Please, do see it and think about it!","Good performances, good idea (by the way, which one is *really* new?), good realization. It has proven Niccol's point in both this movie and Gattaca: Even producers and sponsors are human beings after all and capable of learning and getting it right. If cinema as an art is capable of combining accessibility and relevance, this is the kind of movie cinema was conceived for."
3,Good the first time through....,"I really enjoyed watching this film....the first time. I sincerely enjoyed the movie and all it had to offer but I don't believe this is one of those ""must have"" movies everyone claims it is. I own over 800 movies, 150 on DVD alone, but fail to see the reason to purchase this movie. I have watched the movie a second and third time and didn't catch anything I missed on the first viewing, and was incredibly bored...especially the third time through.If you have not had the chance to view this movie, by all means do, I don't believe you will be disappointed. However I do believe that this movie is one of those that if you do purchase it it will just sit collecting dust while you watch Apollo 13, City of Angels, or The Rock over and over again."

4,Jim Carrey's Best Role.,"I never really wanted to see this movie, but when I did I was impressed. The film starts off slow and a bit boring, but from the split-half to the end, the movie is fully entertaining. Ed Harris and Jim Carrey make their best appearance in a motion picture yet, and that is out of alot. The story is charming, sad and funny, the direciton is beauty and the acting is full-on excellence.Downright Great - The Truman Show is definitely worth a look."
1,Buy Ed Tv instead because this movie stinks,"I didn't expect to see a comedic performance from Jim Carrey when I bought this movie. However, with all the hype that it got, I expected to see a good movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The plot was loosely tied together. I felt that the movie's plot started at the end of Truman's story when the beginning would have been more interesting. With the exception of flashbacks, the audience was never allowed to understand the beginning or the end. What happens after he figures it out? I was also upset by the backhanded comparing of the character Christof and Jesus Christ. Maybe I read that in but I think if it was intentional then it was an insult to the audience. My suggestion to those who want to buy it to see Jim Carrey then they should buy it because he acted fairly well in it. However, if you want to buy it for the plot, then buy ED TV instead. Ed TV is a much better movie and more believeable without insulting the audience. The choice is yours."
1,Completely... Dumb,"1. I can intellectually understand the sentiment that many folks have for this film. I also understand that this is a movie, a fantasy and not reality. However, I can ""believe"" in the reality of something like... Star Trek compared to this completely odd, unrealistic, and basically dumb plot as outlined in the Truman Show.2. As is the case with most movies, it comes down to the narrative, the story and this story is so unbelievable with so many holes in it, that it really does detract from the enjoyment of the film.3. Bottomline: If you're someone who tends to think (even a little) while watching movies, then skip this amazing dud."
1,'Seriously' disappointing!,"To be fair, this movie was never meant to be a typical Jim Carrey vehicle like 'Ace Ventura' or 'The Cable Guy', nor was it advertised as such. Yet I was quite amazed at how utterly humourless it was, completely wasteful of Mr Carrey's tremendous talents. The mere mention of being 'snubbed' for an Oscar-nomination is preposterous!There is little to no story in this dull and overlong picture, apart from the original idea of a person's life as a TV show, which as I remember, was barely enough material for an episode of the 'Twilight Zone'. There is also an inept attempt at some kind of social commentary that goes nowhere, especially with Ed Harris' strange role as the god-like producer of the show providing the movie's most embarrassing moments. Beware too, of what must be the worst musical score in movie history."
1,Overly hyped,"I'm not about to scan over the 260-some commentaries on this flick. I don't think Ed Harris deserved the accolades he received. It's a role that anyone, even Paul Reubens, could have played. I'm a Carrey fan, but he never sold me on his stifled performance. It's a good concept gone awry."
2,Jim Carey shines in this flacid movie,"I had heard what an excellent movie this was. perhaps if I hadn't I would have enjoyed it a little more. The Truman Show was an interesting idea, but if this was the best show of 98, then movies must have really sucked that year. Actually, I saw much better movies in 98 so I know this is actually just a lie. I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't like it either. I have been more excited by the contents of a tissue after blowing my nose, but I threw the tissue away. I would do the same with this movie."
3,Jim Carrey is miscast,"The premise of this film sounded very intriguing, and on the whole the script was well done. Unfortunately, the wrong actor was cast for the lead character. Jim Carrey's Truman lacked the sincerity and earnestness that the character required and that Matthew Broderick, for example, could have brought to the role."
5,iT WAS VERY ORGINAL AND THOUGHT PROVOKING,"i THOUGHT THIS WAS THE MOST ORGINAL IDEA OF A MOVIE i HAD SEEN IN A LONG TIME. iT MAKE YOU PONDER THING LIKE IS THERE SUCH THINGS AS FATE? iT ALSO MAKES YOU WONDER HOW SOMEONE LIKE jfk JR MOST HAVE FELT HAVING HIS WHOLE LIFE WATCHED BY THE WORLD. i NEVER LIKED jIM cAREY BEFORE, BUT HE WAS EXCELLENT IN THIS MOVIE! i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!"
5,What if they made a movie of my life...?,"""The Truman Show"" is a film I often come back to, occasionally, because its premise is so unique and compelling. Certainly, it's a parable and a fantasy; Peter Weir has quite simply added another brilliant film to his awesome filmography. Jim Carrey was expected to be insanely funny because everyone thought he was nuts to begin with. As a previous reviewer said, that's what we expected from Robin Williams, too, and Adam Sandler (""Punch-Drunk Love""). Carrey's performance is so very complete, a wonderful display of sensitivity and focus. I was impressed. Mr. Weir's vision I'm sure had a lot to do with it all, and Laura Linney's performance was much under-rated. Ed Harris was customarily over-reactive. This is a fantasy to be enjoyed and not analyzed at first glance; let it take you in, and question your own mortality. This is a film about self-esteem. For that reason alone, Jim Carrey flies beyond his reputation."
5,"Good Afternoon, Good Evening and GOODNIGHT!","I was totaly blown away with this movie, i just saw it and now i am surprised at all the bad reviewes it is getting here. This movie is about a man who lives inside a fake world where everybody, everplace, and everything is fake. and about his getting wise and escaping. It is NOT a comedy, but does have funny parts and i would reccomend it to everybody who wants a good movie to watch."
5,A great movie!,"'The Truman Show' is excellent - why it was overlooked for theAcademy Awards is totally beyond me. This film tells the tale ofTruman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey) - a man who, unknown to him, lives in an enormous TV studio disguised as a town, and has his entire life televised 24 hours a day. The territory is similar to 'Ed TV' and 'Pleasantville', but The Truman Show is the best of these three - more than a comedy, the film really shows the dark side of Truman's manufactured existence. [Incidentally - in lots of ways this film reminds me of the sixties UK TV series 'The Prisoner' - both have a hero who is trapped on an island he can never leave] This is, for once, an intelligent Hollywood film."
3,This movie was a little weird,I didn't hate it or love it. It was just another movie I saw. If you know what I'm saying? This is the kind of movie they made weird because lots of Jim Careys movies are the kinds of movies where you don't like them or love them there just another movie. So they made this one weird so it would be differant. If you like movies that couldn't come true with out some one gettimg arrested (That aren't violent) then this is a movie for you.
3,"Great concept, so-so delivery","I LOVED the idea of this movie. What a fantastic theme. Unfortunately, the plot itself was pretty weak. The ads for this movie say 'what will he do when he finds out?""He leaves. Takes him 30 seconds. Boy, that was a nail-biter. I think Weir relied too much on his setting and not enough on an actual script for this to be more than just an average movie. The acting was ok, except for the wife, who was absolutely horrible. Either her character was way to cardboard or her acting was. Whichever it was, she didn't make much sense.Still, the movie definately worth a look, if only for it's originality."
5,The Truman Show,"The movie starts out slow and is fairly difficult to watch, however, as the story unfolds it is interesting and valuable."
3,Original? Not!,"Critics were falling over themselves when this one came out, telling us all how original it was. Sorry. The idea has been done before. Did somebody say ""The Outer Limits?"""
3,A highly overrated Twilight Zone episode,"I heard about the critical acclaim for this movie, but ""The Truman Show"" is highly overrated since it is basically a high production Twilight Zone episode with a fine performance by Jim Carrey. The score is brilliant, combining Mozart and New Age music. The director's decision to use a ""real"" suburban town in Florida instead of a set (such as Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands) shows just how much we do live in a world of our making. After seeing this film, you can't help but wonder if suburbia is just one big fantasy island. Also, Ed Harris as Christof is decent in this role, but I just can't see him as anything other the head of Mission Control from ""Apollo 13,"" a role that was perfect for this actor. When Truman disappears, I expected someone to say, ""Christof, we have a problem."""
4,"Genius, Creepy and Ahead of it's time","In retrospect this movie was ahead of it's time, loong before ""Reality"" shows were a staple of regular TV programming. This movie was a preview of where things could go right or wrong for entertainment."
3,"Good movie, but it doesn't really hold up","I remember watching this movie many years ago and it really moved me. A guy in an imaginary world, that's totally real to him, and then everything falls apart and he questions his own existence. After buying it on Blu Ray and watching it again so many years later, the story didn't seem to move me like before and was just ok..."
4,"Great, but ...","I really liked this film, but the plot and writing were a little lacking and overly sentimental. This is definitely worth a look and an enjoyable viewing experience."
4,"""Truman"" a huge breakthrough for Carrey!","I saw an actor behind the face of Ace Ventura and Lloyd Christmas. I saw beyond the ""Mask"" and passed the ""Cable Guy"". I saw Jim Carrey as a very talented actor,not just annoying, and this movie proves that is such a talent. ""The Truman Show"" is such a wonderfully, impressive movie that even the Carrey haters of the world (anyone over 45)would have to take a second look. Fun movie that has a great message and is one of the best films of it's year. Wonderful film making."
3,Pretty good movie,"I saw this for the first time in the theater and when it was over I thought to myself, ""I shouldn't have wasted my money on it."" I really thought it was such a dumb movie! But then the other night it was on TV and I was bored so I sat down and watched it and I actually thought it was pretty good- definitely not the best or one of my favorites, but it's worth renting if you're bored. hope ya like it!"
4,"Great DVD, but where's all the bonus stuff?","The Truman Show is very good film. Good picture, good audio, good story. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! My only gripe with the DVD is the glaring lack of bonus material on the disc. Is'nt this what we buy these things for? Well, and the sound and picture quality! Four stars out of five, could have easily been five stars with the addition of bonus material."
5,Jim Carrey is now acceptable to all audiences,This movie was great. I didn't expect it to be because Jim Carrey isn't the drama type. Or wasn't expected to be. He is great.
5,Good thing-Bad thing,"Good Thing: Jim Carrey's performance is the best yet, with an exception to ""Doing Time on Maple Drive"". A real breakthrough for him and he'll surely be recommended for practically any role in a movie.Bad Thing: Sadly, his performance doesn't seem enough for the Academy Awards. He's not in the Best Actor category, not even nominated. But It'll probably be made up if he wins other awards (i.e. Blockbuster Awards, MTV Movie Awards, Kids' Choice Awards) Then again, maybe not. =)"
5,I thought is was a wonderful story-very interesting.,The Truman Show was such a witty and clever movie. The parts in the movie were so well put together that sometimes you actually thought that you were watching a movie or a TV show. I also thought that Jim Carey did an excellent job in it. It was a nice contrast from some of his other movies. I think he was the perfect guy for the part. This is the reason I gave The Truman Show 5 stars. It truly deserved it.
5,Great Film!!,"One of Jim Carrey's quintessential films, entertaining yet containing certain elements of 'what if'. In a world filled with dozens upon dozens of reality tv shows and trash tv, you have to question whether this isn't a social critique of sorts.Either way, it's extremely funny, and some of Carrey's best acting is featured here."
3,"Pretty good overall, but anyone could have acted in this...","I saw this in the theatres and didn't get into it really until Jim hits the wall. That scene definately pulled on the heart strings. but let's be honest here, ANYONE could have portrayed his role, it wasn't all that 'deep'. had it not been Jim Carrey in this movie, it would have flopped."
3,"Good movie, bad transfer to DVD.","While this is cerianly an interesting movie, and one could argue that this is Jim Carrey's best role to date, on the whole the movie is just an average movie. What is disturbing though, is Paramount's blatent false advertixing of the producr. I bought this movie believing it to be in the wide screen format. The packaging clearly states that this movie is supposed to be wide screen,. let me assure you though that what you get is the pan and scan version. This is a new format, but this sort of foul up is not acceptable."
1,It wasn't all that...,once again a movie is hyped far beyond what it deserves...not a original idea like everyone says...you know what was going to happen...it didn keep my attention...boring....fast forward please...
1,A COMPLETE PILE OF HORSE MANURE,"THIS IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN, MABEYE THE WORST FILM OF ALL TIME. I WOULDN'T BLAME IT ALL ON JIM CAREY. HE DOES ALL HE CAN WITH A 2 DIMENTIONAL CHARCHTER. THIS IS NOT HIS TYPE OF ROLE - STRAIGTH ACTING THAT IS. THE SCRIPT IS NON EXISTENT. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE MOVIE IS WHEN THE CREDITS ROLE. : I THINK CAREY SHOULD STICK TO HIS TRUE DOMAIN COMEDY FILMS SUCH AS DUMB AND DUMBER, ACE VENTURA AND THE MASK."
1,JIM CARREY AT HIS WORST,I saw it a day after its theatre release it was horrible and not funny I thought oh it will be funny jim carreys in it i was wrong I think if you want to see a jim carrey flik buy or rent liar-liar
3,Where will this all end?,"When I saw the Truman Show for the first time, I liked the film, but it wasn't the best film I ever saw. The film shows the way Hollywood could work in future.But there is one thing in this film I don't like, the film shows many people who are fans of the Truman Show and Truman himself, but there is only one person shown, Sylvia, who tries to help Truman out of this faked world. In my opinion it is not realistic, that there is no riot, when a babychild is addoped by a company."
4,"Typical Denise--annoying, but a great workout","I bought this after I had been working out 4-5 times a week for about 6 months. I had a 6-month old baby and needed something quick and effective. I have done Denise's videos for about 10 years now, and she hasn't changed. She is one of the most annoying people ever, and if I met her in person, I wouldn't know whether to hug her or punch her, due to her incessant babbling and ridiculous phrases ""Burn that Butter!!!""But as usual, she delivers a great workout--upbeat, no wasted time. People who are looking for a serious kickboxing tutorial should probably look elsewhere, but if you just want an intense, quick, cardio workout with a bit of toning, this is the tape.Be aware, though, that it was next to impossible for me to do this in front of my husband--he couldn't stop laughing at Denise's silly chatter. You will need to do this when you're alone unless you want to be distracted--anyone hearing this tape without working out to it will be annoyed."
2,Use with Caution,"I was never a Denise Austin fan, but I decided to give this video a try because I grew bored with Tae-Bo. Unfortunately, Denise's cuing is very poor and she changes moves on you without warning. I also question how correctly she is doing some of the moves, especially the kicks. I also found her chatter downright annoying. She talks to you like you are a three year-old who just ate all of his veggies. Please! Will some one please tell this woman that we are adults and she is no longer a high school cheerleader. All in all, I would recommend trying Kathy Smith or Tae Bo, and skip this one."
5,Denise Austin,Video arrived in good condition. Happy with purchase!! I love Denise Austin and like to work out so this video was a good purhase! Happy with purchase and will buy from seller again!!
4,Great for those who want aerobicized kickboxing,"Let me just say that this is a great workout for ANYONE...I've been working out for about 18 months, and this one definitely made me work up a sweat, even though each workout is only 20 minutes. I really don't have any complaints, other than I wish there was more of the punches and kicks...I felt like I didn't do enough."
1,How annoying!,"I have tried this video a few times, with the sound turned up and turned down. The incessant talking caused me to turn it down, but then I had a hard time following the transitions (as did the other people in her video, I might add). There are much better products out there."
3,"stick with what you know, denise","I watched this tape in order to get some new ideas for instructing my kickboxing class which consists primarily of 30-45 year old women with beginner to intermediate skills. Not only did I find the music and Denise's cuing seriously lacking, but her kickboxing knowledge and abilities leave much to be desired. Her constant blabbering, while positive and perhaps inspiring to some, was bothersome to the point of distraction. Her choreography was sloppy and disjointed, and her backup ""class"", most of whom possessed the requisite skills, seemed unprepared for her sudden changes and often contradictory verbal cues. She could use some instruction in proper kicking and punching techniques. While this video might be suitable for absolute beginners who need constant cheerleading, I would not recommend it for anyone who has any kickboxing experience. Leave cardio kickboxing to Billy Blanks."
2,Save your money on this one.,"I have most of Denise's tapes and was really disappointed by this one. Kickboxing is definately not something she does well. Her techniques are poor and the routines are too. She should stick to what she knows (aerobics) and not try to ""jump on board"" a trend. I do have about 20 of Billy Blanks workouts, and love them. If you want a good Denise Austin tape, stick to her ""hit the spot"" and ""gold"" series. Their definately the way to go."
5,Great Workout!,"For those of you who have tried Billy and feel like you just can't keep up... This is no wimpy work out by any means, but I was eager to get into the kickboxing craze. I tried Tae-Bo, but the moves were too fast and confusing for me. I have loved working out with Denise Austin every since I have begun. I have lost 28 lbs and have kept it off even after having a baby. It took a lot of will power, but Denise Austin is a very motivating person."
4,Good Workout,"I enjoy this tape. The variety is good and you work up a good sweat. The impact and choreography isn't too hard to follow. Great for the beginner and intermediate as well as advanced. The only drawback for me was Denise Austin's voice. Gosh! She talks too much and her voice tone is just down right irritating sometimes. If not for that, I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Best workout I have ever tried!,This is an awesome workout! It was fun and it kept my heart rate up. She is very encouraging and I like the fact that the people she features on her video were normal average people and not some supermodel buff bods! She does an excellent job explaning the proper way to punch and kick and the steps(combinations) were a lot of fun! A great addition to your workout!
3,Kickboxing is not for Denise,This is a great workout but the cuing is off pretty bad. Even the people in the background were off. I could tell that Denise isn't use to kickboxing. This is a good workout once you get pass the bad cuing and looking at Denise's kickboxing nots.
5,Best One I've Seen So Far,"I purchased several kickboxing videos and this one is the best. The steps are easy enough to pick up, but not boring. She creates moves that are not awkward or out of step with the music. You can vary intensity easily depending upon your ability. I was sweating at the end."
4,"Energetic, not Smooth","This tape provides two 20-minute workouts. The first concentrates on the basics and moves, but is a good workout. The second is high-intensity. You will get up a good sweat from them.But... Denise does a lousy job of telling you what move to do next. It takes several workouts before you have ANY idea of what's coming before it comes, so it's easy to miss the first rep. Even after doing the tape a bunch, some bits will still be called too late, resulting in being a bit off.The other ""downside"" is that this isn't really kickboxing. It's aerobics with kicking and punching, but kickboxing safety/fundamentals (such as overextension) aren't covered.On the other hand, I do this workout quite a bit because it's a better workout than a real kickboxing workout would be, it's intense, and it's fast. No time for boredom. So if you're willing to learn the order of the moves and occaisionally stutter-step to catch up, it's great."
4,Out of shape?,This is great for anyone with any kind of kickboxing experience. It is easy to follow and leaves you feeling great in the end. The music is kind of lame but it is great for someone starting to get in shape or looking for a change in work out routine.
5,It is an amazing workout!!,"I recently viewed ths video and it was great!!! I did the exercise routine and the next day I can feel the burn! It is fun and kept my heart rate up! There are two parts to this video and the ""beginner"" part is no walk in the park!! =) My only complaint with this video as with most Denise Austin tapes is that the warm up and cool down is to short."
3,Not her best work.......,"Well, this video was very drabby to me. It's kinda gray and black and there's not much vibrance to it. Denise can be inspiring at times but on this video she was mostly annoying with her, ""yes, punch it, yes, come on, yes, that's it"". If you close your eyes to this video, at times you may think your watching a ""different"" type of video. It was a bit over the top with her remarks. I do not think this is a begginer video at all. The back up work out people behind her looked rather clumbsey and asleep, missing que's and moving the wrong way, or off beat. Some of them even looked like begginers. I give it 3 stars because although it did get my heart pumping at times, it was not worth more then 3 dollars."
2,"Poorly written, illogical tale","This book is only suitable for kids. The characters are uninteresting at best, and annoying at worst. The female lead character comes out with cutsy remarks that don't fit the mood or action. She is actively annoying.Also, this book is not really a Star Trek novel. Kirk and company only occupy a few pages near the end of the book.This is a poor story, poorly executed. I was disappointed."
5,Depends if you are a Trek fan.,"If I had to give this book a brief description, I'd call it ""eye candy for Star Trek fans"".Have you ever watched an episode of a television series and thought ""I wonder what will happen to those characters?"" regarding guest stars? This will answer at least part of that question regarding characters from the Star Trek episode ""Assignment: Eternity"", as we see Gary Seven and Roberta Lincoln after they met the crew of the Enterprise.The main point of the book is to give the reader a view into the life of Khan Noonien Singh before the episode ""Space Seed"". I thought it was reasonably effective in that regard.If you are a Trek Fan, I strongly recommend this book."
2,Wasted Effort,"As a big Trek fan, I was intrigued with the title and premise of this book.Unfortunately, the author spends so much time trying to be cute by weaving other Trek characters and historical events into the book that he forgets to write a really good story.A big disappointment."
1,um... no.,"These Khan books are just plain bad. Full of cute trekkie references, they are for die-hard trekkies only. And I'm a huge Khan fan, so I was pretty let down. Really, this is not how I imagined the Eugenics wars at all. Did I mention the writing is atrocious? Some of the worst I've come across. Maybe that's because these were the first Trek novels I've read, so I didn't know to lower my expectations...Do yourself a favor and skip this junk. Get some real sci-fi instead!"
1,just a vehicle,"This book is little more than a vehicle for Greg Cox to demonstrate his knowledge of political and cultural history of the late 20th century, as well as his knowledge of the Star Trek universe. Khan and Gary Seven (with faithful sidekicks Roberta and Isis) tromp through world history a la Forrest Gump except with an agenda. Allegedly, their agenda is the same, to help humanity survive into the 21st century, although Khan already shows signs of being the anti-hero we know from episode and movie. How he goes from being so idealistic, if ruthless, being exiled on the Botany Bay is a question left to Volume II, which I may find the patience to read one day."
4,another Great Cox novel,"This novel attempts to show the altered Star Trek reality in our 20th century. It succeeds admirably when tied into present day events and having Gary Seven, Roberta Lincoln add to the story. The Eugenics wars are a underground conflict fought between the Augments. It is not the Third world war fought in the 21st century. Cox ties the strings together nicely and it is best to read this novel before reading his latest novel ,The Rings of Time. that way you at least get some background to the latest novel."
4,beatdownbeatdownbeatdown,"if you like breakdowns and very heavy riffs, buy this album. their new cd doesnt really set my pants on fire but Cover Your Tracks is a very solid heavy record. and its cool that all the songs on it are named after tom cruise movies"
5,Serves its purpose,"Bury Your Dead have created the Anthem for the Mosh pit. They knew what they were doing with this album, making it heavy, hard and the pace unwavering. They weren't trying to explore new concepts, or trying to create a masterpiece album. If you've ever seen them live, you know immediately that the material on this album alone creates a breath taking live show. Maybe not in the arena circuit as seen on Ozzfest, but definitely when they play smaller venues and club shows, such as Chain reaction (shown on their DVD). Its fast, its hard, its fun."
3,"good size, color, build, but color is way off from amazon photo","This is a good product for it's build quality, size, and price.BUT --- The 'chocolate' color is orange and light brown. it's nowhere near chocolate.The color is tolerable to me, but nothing I would ever use more than once or twice a year probably.Don't count on shining a light on this background while you're taking the picture because it's way too bright.I sent mine back because the color was so off from the picture."
2,Not my favorate pair of little black shoes.,"These black pumps were not at all my favorite pumps to wear; after one hour I had to take them off and that's with a gel shoe pad in them. The size runs weirdly long but small. However, I still love Charles David for all my dressy shoe needs and will give them a second chance."
1,"Great look, no picture.","If you want to waste your money on a nice looking TV that can only get the Spanish soccer channel, look no further. I had high hopes for this product when I bought it, but SONY let me down with a horrible product that gets little to no reception. I am returning it."
3,Jazz Harp,I liked Richard Hunters Jazz harp book for the most part. I thought there was to much Diatonic material in it. I already know how to play the Diatonic quit well and wasn't buying a book on that. So less of what wasn't advertised and more what it was suppose to be would have been better!The record that goes along with the book is absolutly terrible! I can't think of a redeming qaulity!The recording left me very dissapionted!I do like the book though and if your able to think for yourself and expand on some of the stuff in the book. It is worth it. It has pointed me in a direction that I am enjoying!
5,This is Ruth ettings finest works...,"Ruth Etting was a beautiful Zigfield girl, who became a popular jazz/pop singer, she kind of reminds me of a female version of Bing Crosby. Keep Sweeping The Cobwebs Off The Moon, Aint Misbehavin(a Fats Waller tune), More Than You Know, All Of Me & Ten Cents A Dance(her biggest hit) are all highlights of this fine cd release. Fans of Annette hanshaw and Lee Morse will also want to Real Ruthie's renditions of typical 1920's/30's pop tunes. Also heard in her backup bands is Rube Bloom, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Eddie Lang, Joe Venuti, Bunny Barigan, Glenn Miller(as arranger), and others... You will love this informitive cd, it serves as perfect intro to a world class singer..."
3,Picture color way off,"The bowl is nice and heavy, feels good in the hands. But I was expecting a creamy light yellow and it came as more a bright mustard color. Perfectly functional, it just doesn't match my kitchen in the way I hoped."
3,Nice enought looking and worth $15 bucks BUT,Glaze is very uneven and around rim there is some 'dips' in the smoothness. Some discoloration of glaze as well. First time I used a mixer in it the blades left marks. Not the best quality bowl but for the price what would a person expect. Worth what I paid for it and not a cent more.
3,Okay,"This was a wedding gift and I didn't have time to return it and get something different - otherwise, I would have. It looked kind of cheap. I was kind of embarrassed to give it as a gift. I like the design, but the finish was kind of ugly. Perhaps a different color would be better?"
3,"Great story, cheaply made",Enjoyed the story. The ending could have been more complete by show the end results instead of telling of it. cheaply made
3,Section 8,"Your choice of movies where you'll just have to see it for yourself, it was ok nothing special. I really could'nt get into it."
2,dvd movie,not the best dvd but at the end had a better understanding of the movie only glad I purchased it on sale not worth over 5.00
1,Section 8?,Well you didn't hear this from me it was boring and if I recall after 15 minutes I ended the movie. Therefore Im unable to give a honest review.
3,Not too thick and wide enough,GMC logo on the mud guard was okay. Thickness of the plastic was very light for my liking as it will not be able withstand much stress. The number of installation screws attached were not enough for the installation. I am actually looking forward to buying another model as replacement because it does give me much expected aesthetic value I needed.
1,Where are they and now they are too expensive!,"I ordered many sets of this product 7/24/07, and have not received them to date. I have others and do like them, but this delay has been a major problem as I planned on using them at a special event 8/20/07. I finally received them... too late for the event, but not for others. I really like them, so when I returned to Amazon to order more, I discovered the price had skyrocketed! So I searched and found them for half the price on Wasterstroms (a restaurant supply company)."
2,might be ok for some people who just need the parts,Confused to buy it again and do not recommend to anyone who does not know what exactly it requires to replace
2,its so so,The light bulb did not last long and the arm kept falling down no matter how tightened it was.
2,Bad Construction,Nice looking lamp but the adjustable arm on this lamp cannot hold the lamp's weight. Therefore it just bends over. What a piece of junk.
4,great for the price,"read some of the other reviews re flawed construction but mine works perfectly. Has that ''made in China'' glow but for $16 can't complain. Also like the smaller size vrs some of the very large flexible lamps, great for a smaller size desk."
1,"Costa Rica was excellent, but Fodor's04 needs to be updated","My wife and I just returned from the Guanacaste Province, staying at NW Pacific resort. The vacation was great, but ""Fodor's 04"" was of little or no help. I thoroughly enjoy planning my vacation and activities well in advance of the actual trip, but was very much unable to do so with this book.My impression of the book is that it has been slow to be updated, with the 04 version containing little beyond 2000. At the same time it seems to focus on travelers planning to tour Costa Rica staying at a different hotel/lodge/resort/camp each night. I realize that many of the natural attractions of this beautiful country are unchanged over the years, but a significant portion of a vacation includes items that do change, especially in a country such as Costa Rica where tourism is the leading industry, and is rapidly growing."
1,Inaccurate and exaggerated,"I bought this book prior to my trip to Costa Rica and found it to be inaccuarate. Descriptions of most things and places are exaggerated and it was very disappointing to go to what the book describes as a happening place and find that it is just a 'one horse town'.I ususally buy Frommers and this was the first time I tried Fodor's book, never again. This book is a waste of money."
3,"Terrible movie, beautiful 3D.",I sat down to watch this with my wife for the 3D. The 3D was SO amazing that I didn't even notice how terrible the movie was until near the end.
2,"Trite, boring movie","I am a high school dance teacher and have watched virtually every dance film ever created. This movie is boring and predictable. At least Step Up 1 drew me into the characters. The dancing is good, not great in Step Up 3. What really bothers me about current dance movies is the constant editing. You never get a sense of the artistry of the dance, it is just a jumbled blur. Look back at Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly if you really want to see fabulous FULL length UNEDITED dance sequences. This movie was a total yawn......."
2,A disgrace to Step Up,"If what you like about Step Up is the dancing, the acting, or the story...don't bother buying Step Up 3.The acting is horrible, the story could have been written by a 5 year old and it would be the same or even better. The dancing is not that bad, however all the special effects and 3-D bullsht keeps you from really seeing it. Step Up 1 and 2 were a good work, the 3d one looks like they came Up with an idea and made it in one day"
1,"OK 3D, terrible movie - avoid like plague","I just got a 3D TV, 3D blu-ray player and a pair of glasses for it and wanted to test out the 3D. This film was the most highly rated in terms of 3D quality that I could see, based on amazon.com reviews. In fact, the 3D is standout in places, but the film itself is atrocious. Suggest avoiding this like the plague - go for one of the animated featured (despicable me, etc.) or a life blu-ray such as one of the iMax features. This is what middle-aged hollywood execs provide for younger people - utterly clueless."
5,Great movie better than revolution for sure,"This was a wonderful movie, with a mix of genres. Excellent for girls night or with your gentleman, or even just the family"
3,Step Up 3 Didn't,This is the least successful of the four Step Up dance films so far. The choreography is good but the magic is missing.
1,Reaaly bad movie - poorly and unconvincing performances,"While I got the movie primarily for what I hoped would be cool dance sequences, everything about the movie was disappointing - from the ridiculous plot to the performances. Quite honestly, even the choreography was filmed badly. The technical quality of the 3D was fine - but nothing else was interesting in the movie."
5,STEP UP 3D - AWESOME 3D DANCING,"1) A+ for 3D2) A+ for the Dancing3) A for the soundtrack4) B- for the story lineAll in all, a 5 star movie because of the excellent 3D and dance scenes. The dancing in 3D will blow you away. Nice DVD to show off your 3D Plasma and HD Sound System."
1,not worth the time,"Lousy acting...repetitive dance moves, story line that looks like an elementary school play written by 3rd graders!Picked it up on prime while browsing through catalogue..there are definitely better dance movies"
3,just a gift!,This was a gift for my grandaughter and she really liked it. There's no more to say except I watched too. Nice music sharp dancers.
4,The best of the Step Up series!,"I liked this one better than the first two Step Up movies! The story is repetitive basically a bunch of kids need money and they enter a contest and so it goes but the dancing in this is what impressed me, not the story. I was happy to see ""Moose"" reprise his role. He's super cute! The main character (the guy on the cover) seemed to disappear whenever the real dancing happened which I thought was funny but the dance numbers were off the chain! The dancer that did the robot in the first part of the film was phenomanal. I've never seen someone move just like a robot like that! They also did a dance in water which was just like the second movie but it was a great dance sequence anyway. The final dance number was also outstanding with the lighted suits they were wearing. It was amazing! I found myself rewinding this movie to see the dance sequences again and again! I highly recommend this if you like dance movies."
5,Suprisingly Good!,This movie was surprisingly good for a dance movie and the 3D makes it even more cool. They do not kid themselves and try to make the movie based on the plot like a You Got Served movie. The dancing is awesome and I really enjoyed it.
3,More Good Content For The New 3D TVs,"Okay, the story and characters didn't particularly draw me in (hence the three star rating), but the music, dancing and excellent 3D photography made up for those flaws."
5,One of the best dancing movies,This movie contains some of the best dancing sequences of all time. The Blu-Ray quality is one of the best and the extras are great. A must buy for all dancers and dancing lovers
3,It was okay,I enjoyed the dance scenes. I was not crazy about the story line. The last two installments were better in my opinion.
1,Hated it.,"In my opinion, the movie was badly acted, had a terrible cliche plot, and the dancing was so overboard it was silly. One of the worst movies I have ever seen."
5,enjoyed it alot,This is the best movie I have seen recently. It made me laugh and experience something new. I would watch it again.
5,everybody dance,"A nice feel good movie!The dance scenes are incredible!!! it's nice to see a movie about one person trying to make a difference for him, his friends and neighborhood.It reinforces that old adage that persistance over comes resistance.You will enjoy the movie."
5,Completely satisfied,"This remote control is identical in look and function to my original, and it was actually a few dollars cheaper than some other universal remotes that may not work as seamlessly with the Direct TV system. It came pre-programmed to control my Direct TV receiver, and was easily programmed (about 3 minutes total) for the TV, VCR, and DVD. Now I just hope it lasts longer than the 14 months I got out of the controller that came with the system."
2,Not very Universal,The only advantage of this remote was it cam ewith my directv reciever. It has minimal range. It looses all presets once you remove the battery. It does only basic features of other equipment. I also find it requires a heavy hand to get it to acknowledge the button presses!Do not buy this remote.
2,Not ideal for Directv,"This remote doesn't have the same buttons (functions) that my original remote had to use with Directv DVR. If, like me, you subscribe to the old ""Ultimate"" Directv this remote isn't an exact copy even though it looks very similiar."
3,remote,was sent wrong remote and never got a replyI called 4 different times and no tech suportfinnally got customer service to refund the total cost and shipping
3,Have this on vcr,Does play in Sony blue ray /DVD player but quality isn't great vcr is better . But vcr doesn't work anymore . May have been recorded from vcr . But is real good old aerosmith from rocks tour witch is my favorite album

5,Hoover you have done it again,"I had purchased a Dirt Devil and was extremely satisfied, but moved and now had thick pile rugs that could not be cleaned well. Who on earth now sells a reasonabley priced and yet efficient product today that will not break in two days? I searched and searched and found Hoover, an older company that had survived, wow, I thought I remember that name from when I was a kid. Yes, along time ago, let's just say about 50 years. The price was right as I only have 3 rugs to clean and I used it and it worked better than expected. I can now look forward to living in a house where I am not continually sneezing due to the special filter and still have money left over. At least almost enough to fill my gas tank LOL"
4,Easy to assemble and gets the job done.,"I was horrified by how much this vacuum was able to suck off my carpet and furniture. I had not idea how much dust could accumulate. I like the bagless feature as well, since I do not have to spend any more money on the vacuum after the original purchase. No wonder consumer reports rated this model highly. And amazon had the best price I could find, especially with free shipping."
1,Uugh,"The other negative reviews hit the main problems right on: It's brand-name and looks good especially with the no bag and allergen/asthma feature.HOWEVER, the problems are thus after like 5 uses: very low suction, impossible to find filters, clogged mechanism, respouting of debris, and the clumsiness of emptying the bagless-part.Anyone know of a good vacuum cleaner?"
4,A Burning Touch,Very entertaining and well written. I wish she would write more contemporary novels. I have read the only two offered by Amazon and enjoyed both. A very good read and I recommend for anyone who enjoys contemporary romance.
4,Creepy,"The Evil Stalker was almost impossible to put down because it was sooo creepy. Knowing the stalker was within breathing distance of the heroine made me afraid to turn the pages, but wanting to know who the stalker was overroad that fear. It would have been five stars were it not for many typographical errors that littered the novel."
5,Simple from start to finish.,"I bought the SB4100. Being an old Motorola ModemSurfer customer is what made me decide to try the SB4100. The instructions are on a CD. You can print the instructions or move from screen to screen and install (sit the modem on the desk and connect the wires to it) the modem as you read. Once the wires are connected the modem does all of the work. Everything you need to connect the modem to your computer is included. The entire process is extremely simple and the modem does all of the work for you. Not to mention, it is screaming fast when connected. Just for personal knowledge, I am using a local cable company for my connection (Cable One) and have a 1/2 T1 connection. Price, ease, availability. Motorola wins again."
1,short lived,"I got this thing brand new one yr ago. It just broke yesterday (one yr and one month later) for no appearant reason. Had a tek come out and he plugged in some dinky toshiba modem and verified my line was good. Stuck it bak into my SB4100, nada. Now, for a device with no moving parts that just sits in one location (had mine in a nice spot, not humid, not wet, not hot, not dusty, etc) batting around electrons, you would think it would last much longer. Gonna go with linksys this time, my 2 yr router is still working so I hope their cable modems are just as reliable. After this exp, there's no way I'm gonna try motorola's SB4200."
5,My Surfboard 4100 Is Dead :(,"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this modem. Mine served me well for around 18 years. Lightening hit a cable line in my neighborhood last week and took out a great many electronics. My SB 4100 , Belkin router, and a network card in one of my computers were victims as well.When I went to the cable office to purchase a new 6120 Surfboard, they said they only had ubee modems. I figured for $30 it sounded like a good deal.I am back on the Internet. I can do everything that I could before. But: This BRAND NEW MODEM is not doing as well as my old Surfboard 4100. I have checked in at three different speed test sites and my old Surfboard's numbers were better than this ubee.If you have one of these 4100 modems, use it until it just stops working. Do NOT listen to the crap that the cable companies try to feed you about how it is no good, slow, and blah blah blah. It is a great modem. I missed mine the minute I got the ubee up and running."
1,OLD OBSOLETE MODEM,"This modem is currently obsolete and as a result, incompatible with Comcast's High Speed internet. I purchased it and ended up having to buy a newer model..."
3,could of been better,the ball holder had light scratch blemishes . the card holder could of been better in design quality..i guess i see where the $11 price came from they lacked in quality.
5,Very Good Value for The Money!!!,I bought this display for an autographed AJ Burnett baseball I recieved for Christmas. The display looks very nice in my office.
1,"All look, no function !","The Miami Basic telephone has a wonderful art deco appearance. As an accent piece it is truly unique. When receiving telephone calls, the reception is excellent. Unfortunately, if you wish to make a call, the numbers are barely visable. If you never have the need to call out, this is a great telephone."
5,Good Replacement Battery,This is the second time we have purchased these batteries for our phone and have been very pleased with the performance. Both times we have found that they have lasted at least as long as the OEM and this last one has been even better!
4,finally a good new tough guy band,now i love tough guy hardcore music but there are just to little bands. i mean the only ones i can think of off the top of my head are Hatebreed Sick of it All Agnostic Front Madball and Throwdown. Shutdown is pretty good but i dont i would call them tough guy. but now finally we have Bury Your Dead. these guys have been around since 2003. they have to recording albums. Cover Your Tracks and You Had Me at Hello. now they just released this great live album. they take all of the energy off of those two albums and times it by 8. each is intense and awesome. the intensity only stop in the breaks between songs when the lead singer talks and yells at the crowd. the songs are filled with great hardcore yelling double kick drums and awesome breakdowns. the recording really makes you feel like you were there at the show. these guys are the best tough hardcore band since Hatebreed and on this album they prove it even more.
3,Odd Assortment,"I came to this book with the wrong idea. I had expected variations on a theme, but this turned out to be a bewildering hodge-podge. (I had hoped for a running dissection of the strange things people believe and why they believe them -- alas, not here. Much of this book is just 'inside baseball' for dedicated sci-fi fans.) Gardner's breadth is undeniable, as is his passion for the diverse topics he addresses here, but I found myself uncaptivated by his enthusiasm. If you are not a sci-fi fan and if you're not looking for detailed debunkings of obvious absurdities like 7th Day Adventism and astrology, then caveat emptor."
1,Dont waste you time with this battery,"I give this battery 1 star because that is as low as it goes. Sure it is a battery and compared to my old dead ones this one works alright. It doesnt last at all. I get 1000-1500 frames out of my CTA brand replacement batteries, but only 300 out of this one. The CTA has been discontinued so i took a chance with this one. I got this battery as my third string and that is about all it is worth, a total last resort. spend the extra twenty bucks on a different brand. i thought energizer would do me right, but not so much."
2,Get what you pay for...,"I've had this Jensen unit in my '98 Jeep Cherokee for about 3 years now. It's a decent unit at best. Yes, it's nice that it fits the factory hole and is CD/Cassette, but the FM Sensitivity is horrible!"
2,Dull...,"Unfortunately, this book simply isn't very well written... it reads like an 8th grader's English homework. The interviewees don't really shed any light on Microsoft, and their stories are so lacking in detail as to be pointless. Read ""Gates"" for a far better treatment of the topic."
2,not up to the mark,"Just another book. Nothing special. As the name suggests, I wanted to have a look into the way these first guys faced compitition. That is missing. The stories lack in detail. Also its does not cover the complete Diaspora of the kind of people working at Microsoft."
3,Good Retirement Blues!,The interviews are with people (10 out of 12 pictured) who were at the company at 1996 IPO. The profiles more and less read like: He/She worked VERY hard! Had done a lot of nice things! The company started to become bureaucratic! I quit and now a have a lot of time and time.The bottom line is: People got their money and decided to retire early.
3,Great system and wonderful explanation,"Love the concept and I want to use it more regularly, but it is difficult to use in the Kindle Android or Cloud format.I find the pictures don't display in a way that's easy to follow from screen to screen, so I've found it difficult to be sure I'm doing the movements correctly.I would love to see a DVD available - I've done extensive searching online and not found something - Amazon, I suggest a collaboration!"
4,Strong Advice,"This is a great DVD. Not only does this copy provide deleted scenes, but it also comes with the highly anticipated alternate ending. This DVD also comes with rare director's commentary, which will provide excellent fodder for this fim's cult following. The Alternate ending, highly gossiped about on the net, shows Zorba telling the audience the movie's over, and to go home . . . A'La ""Ferris Buehler's Day Off"". Yes This DVD is very much worth its weight in gold. I myself, own 5 copies, and I just keep buying it again. I literally have 3 DVD's that I bought and immediately threw away before opening. If you're talking about ejaculation then no. So Buy Up, People. Once you've watched it a minimum of 5 times, you'll be thanking me."
1,Incorrect delivery.,I ordered 2 pair of Copa Cool Flex Specs. One in Black & White color another inPurple & Yellow color. Received one pair Black & White. Never got the other color.Invoice stated shipped 2 pair.Bad experience. Send e-mail to customer service waiting for respond.
2,Too much hype,I WAZ SO DISAPPOINTED AT THIS CD..AFTER ALL THE HYPE MY HOMIES PUT ON THIS CD..ALL IT HAS IS LYRICS..WHERE IS THE BEATS...THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME..I COULDN'T FIND THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SONGS..I LISTENED TO THIS CD AND TOOK IT BAC..AS FAR AS COMPARIN HIM TO BONE..BONE WROTE THE TICKET ON THEIR STYLE..THERE'S ONLY COPIES.. MR. SANCHO NO DISREPECT BUT IM SURE UR NEXT WILL BE TIGHTER..
5,I love this gadget!!,Purchased this item and was skeptical about how it would work. It took a little bit of figuring - on how to work it..........but it's one great manicure/pedicure gizmo. It's just what I hoped it would be and better.I would not hestitate - one day down the road - to get another one.
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,Wow! I love this tool. I just used it for the first time and it made the entire filing process so much easier versus manual nail files. I recommend this to anyone dedicated to doing their own acrylics. It will pay for itself in no time.
4,Overall a good drill,"Overall, this is a very decent drill. I do recommend that if you're going to use it to grind down existing acrylics that you purchase carbide bits, which aren't included with the drll. Otherwise, you will spent a lot of time doing this with the bits that come with the drill. The only thing that it lacks is being able to use it in the reverse mode. Other than that this is a good drill at a good price."
2,Frustrated!!!,I didn't have this a month and it stopped working. Loose connection it starts and stops constantly.
3,I guess I'm not professional enough but I still have hope.,"I love the concept of this product but the instructions that came with it were so bare bones minimal it was difficult to figure out what went where and now that I have misplaced that treasured little piece of paper , which I had to enlarge on the copy machine at work in order to read, I am left with a product that I'm sure I'll love a soon as I figure it out. Ok, so I'm not mechanically inclined but then I shouldn't have to be."
2,Chabrol at his least interesting,"Les Noches Rouges/Wedding in Blood is one of Claude Chabrol's worst films from his richest period, an utterly mundane crime passionel devoid of insight or interest despite being set in the small town bourgeois milieu that had served him so well in the past and would again in the future. Chabrol has always had a tendency towards caricature, and the laughable passionate embraces between Michel Piccoli and Stephane Audran (neither at their best) or the half-dimensional corrupt mayor are indicative of the clumsiness of the whole sorry enterprise, as is the lumbering flashback setting up the murders. Things briefly threaten to get interesting after the second murder, but by then the film is nearly over and the promise remains unfulfilled.Arrow's UK PAL DVD has an acceptable but far from outstanding transfer with optional English subtitles."
4,amazonlover,If you have an appetite for history this author's material fits perfectly. Having met him a few times kinda lends itself to the authencity of his research going back almost 40 yrs.
1,Waste of money,WoW this game is horrible. It is like all of 2 levels with no chance to lose. there really isn't any point to the game. Don't waste your money.I would have gave this game negative stars if I could.
3,Ladies and gentlemen over the age of 10...,You might find this game a little on the repititive weary side if you are a gamer...If you are under the age of ten and not a hard core gamer this game may have a chance with you. However I would suggest renting it before you actually buy it.Unless it is on the bean rack somewhere at your nearest Circuit City or Electronics Boutique for less than 20 bucks it is not going to be part of my collection anytime soon.
1,LAME,"If you have a single brain cell and a memory problem you will love this game. Your single cell will enjoy the one button action and your memory problem will hide the fact that you have been shooting at the same five chickens for duration of the game. Which is endless.You may also like this game if you are accustomed to sitting on the porch in a rocking chair with a shotgun in hand ready to shoot varmints.Overall, simply the worst game ever released."
2,Pretty lousy,"Cartoonish graphics, very little excitement... just get Link's crossbow gun instead. It comes with a much better shooting game."
2,Chicken Shoot,"I bought this game for my 10 year old daughter because she received a gun for her Wii, so I thought this would be a great game that was violence free. Well it is a good game for much younger children but it was pretty boring for my daughter. You only learn by purchasing and experiencing it."
1,Could be fun for the kids...but an otherwise worthless game.,"When purchasing Chicken shoot, we thought it might bring us back to the days of Duck Hunt for the original Nintendo. Boy, were we disappointed. Chicken Shoot is by far the worst game I've owned for the Wii thus far.The goals in the levels don't really make sense, since the level continues on even after you shoot your required number of chickens. Multi-player is split screen and just awful. The graphics on the game are bad as well...looking like they came straight from a 5-year old's coloring book.I didn't even make it through the first level before I got tired of playing the game.Chicken Shoot has potential for entertaining small children, but for anyone else, avoid at all costs."
3,Great for little ones,"This game is good for younger kids. My 2 daughters ages 5 and 7 love it. It's simple, and easy enough for them to do by themselves. I wouldn't buy this game if you are looking for a real challenge or hours of adult entertainment but it's fun for the kids."
4,If you are looking for a game (Wii) for a non-gamer this is it.,"I bought this game for my girlfriend who incidentally thinks that MSN Games are the greatest thing to hit the internet besides MySpace. She loves it, and to be honest it isn't that bad. Don't get me wrong, I would rather play Battlefield 2142, or Resistance Fall of Man any day of the week. The game play is very repetitive, the graphics are ok, the best part about this game is that my girlfriend and I get to spend some time together. I would recommend that this title is a rent, and then maybe a buy (if your bf/gf likes it)."
2,Chicken Shoot,"As far as getting what I ordered, I was satisfied. The product was in great condition and arrived promptly. However, the game itself was not what I expected, didn't keep our interest, BUT, it would be great for a very young child. It's easy to play and kid-friendly."
2,Bad one,"This is a bad one. It is easy for a 5 year old, but at the same time it is bad. The duck shooting game in Wii Play is much better than this one, though both have the same theme more or less"
1,Worst Wii Game Ever,"This game is a complete and total waste of time and money. It reminds me of a shareware program that you can pick up for free on the internet, or even at Big Lots for 99 cents.In other words, if you are lucky enough to own a Wii, pass on this game. I give it a 0 out of 5 stars."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"This game is rated for 10 and up. My son is six. He thinks it's boring. You shoot endless waves of chickens. Um, hooray!? Avoid this game like the plague."
5,FAVORITE Wii Game ever....,"OK, so it's a little corny, but this really is our favorite Wii game. I bought this for my 4 and 6 year olds (yes, I know it's E10+) and we love to play it with them. It IS first person shooter, but it's very cartoony and silly. You basically shoot all these crazy chickens that go by on the screen. Reminds me of the old Duck Hunt a little."
1,Waste of Money,"I should've never bought this game. I mean, who really wants to kill poor innocent chickens that haven't done anything to us? This game is just plainly shooting chickens the whole way which is VERY boring and stupid. Overall, if the subject of the game is stupid, you can almost predict the game will be bad. In other words, this game STINKS!!!!!!"
3,This is an easy fun for the little ones game hard core gamers stay away,Ok this is a very simple game it is basically a point and shoot game.It is very simple and reminds me of the flash games you play at work when your bored at work.I bought this and played it with my 10 year-old daughter she likes it and enjoys it .If you are a hard core gamer you will hate this game as its very simple and easy to play.It is worth it for kids under 12 i would say but over 12 i would not recomend it is a fun little game and if you can find it used for 20 bucks like i did it is worth it.But brand new i would not recomend for 30 bucks
1,VERY LAME,"My 8 yr old son hates this game. He played for 10 minutes and asked, is this it? He spent $20 of his own $ for this game and I felt so bad, I have him the $20 back. I think from now on, we will rent games before making a purchase. So far I have 3 Wii games that are pretty sorry."
1,Do Not Purchase,"My kids are 6 and 8 and after 10 minutes they did not like the game. Its the same old thing over and over again, and if there was ever a game I would like to get my money back this is it - do not purchase. If the company that produced this game had any focus on the market they would never have released such as simple and uneventful game."
4,Easy and fun,"We are not gamers. My 5 yr old loves it and so do I. This game is a great one out of the box. We cannot figure out how to play 60% of the Wii games we own and my husband and I are educated people. I am not the kind of person to take hours to figure out a game. I want instant fun and chicken shoot delivers that. Die hard gamers will be dissapointed. This game is a chicken shoot, thats it. But we have played it a bunch and still laugh and think its fun!"
2,Chicken Shoot Wii Game,"Ok game for the kids; however, not too accurate with pointer device, even if calibrated above or below TV. Only one set could be close to accurate. If you have small kids, they might not mine. Otherwise don't spend your money."
2,Amusing for about 10 minutes,"We got this game with our Wii as part of a bundle, and it was a bit of a disappointment. It's funny and cute for about ten minutes, but gets old pretty quickly. It would be great if it was just one of several games on a disc, but being the entire game, it's not worth it.However, if you like shooting games but get dizzy in those 3-D ones, you may enjoy this. The graphics are pretty funny!"
3,Nice Book,The book is nice and it gives in great detail the meaning of each poglike dolphin chip. The book explains everything and I highly recommend it. But why only 4 out of 5 stars? Well you have to purchase the dolphin cards seperately.
3,More lecture than information,"It took me forever to read this book, which is unusual for me. The main reason was that it presents itself like a lecture, and less like actual information on the meaning of the cards. It is great that the author likes to remind and educate the readers to protect the planet and all the inhabitants, but please keep that for the appendix or the introduction!Some cards have no real description to them in the text at all, just anecdotes and lectures, so it seemed like sometimes the author did not have much info to give on certain cards, and pulled her own stories out of the sleeve. The meaning of the cards becomes disturbed and confused by that."
2,Won't work on MemoryStick Pro,"It works great with the older MemoryStick (128Mb or smaller) and no driver is required. Just put the MemoryStick in and it works like a floppy drive.However, it won't work on MemoryStick Pro and MagicGate card.If you want the newer model that compatible with MemoryStick Pro, get Sony MSAC-PC3 Memory Adapter instead."
1,"Will not work with ""PRO"" duo memory sticks!","The seller should make it clear that the reader does not work with ""PRO"" duo memory sticks!"
2,only works intermittently on my mac,"I have the Sony Memory Stick PC Card Adapter (MSAC-PC3) and it's very unreliable on my mac (powerbook, osx 10.3.8). Most of the time it just doers not work at all. When i insert the memory stick the little red light flickers a bit but then nothing. If I shut my mac down completely, leave it off for a few minutes, then boot it again then the crd reader will sometimes work. All in all not a very satisfactory product for mac users."
1,Don't buy the 3rd party reader,"It worked only some of the time, usually my PC wouldn't recognize the hardware. I sent it back, seller was very accomodating. Now I've ordered a genuine Sony reader."
5,"Monster Ballads, Vol. 2 Review",This cd was great and the one my husband wanted. The songs are very enjoyable.
5,kool n kool,"hiyathese songs i know them by heart, iv been n2 this type of music for the last 17 yrs that more then 1/2 my life. but still im buying this cd because the wife liked the 1st cd and now im 100% sure shes gonna like this cd. long live true rock n roll, and i hope that they release a 3rd cd full of killer songs, could you add GNR november rain. thnx"

4,very satisfied,This item was a great deal with an awesome price. Fast shipping and it plays perfect. No scratches and no skipping of tracks. i would recommend this seller over and over again. Thank you
1,Hideous...don't waste your time,"This STORY had potential, but was ruined by bad writing and worse acting. It had one redeeming quality....the movie begins with US Senator John McCain expressing his interest in UFOs. The time I wasted on the movie, was well worth that little tidbit of information about a potential Presidential candidate!! Thank you Director Roy Knyrim for that little heads-up!"
2,ALIEN SIGHTING NOT SO EXCITING,"Jason Connery as a Texan? His accent is so enhanced with his Scottish brogue that one never believes Sean's son is anything but Scottish. This movie is supposedly based on a true incident which occurred in Arizona in 1997. But it's really a dull scifi wanna be, with minimal tension or suspense. A group of five friends encounter alien beings when they wreck their van, and one of their members is seriously injured by falling on a knife. Connery plays a man whose truck broke down and he lends a hand. It's all foolishly contrived and the performances (AJ Cook, George Stults, Ashley Peldon, Geraldine Yeo) pretty ineffectual. Not really worth a view, unless you're really into alien encounters."
1,why bad movies keep coming out to insult us?,"it told you in the year of 199x, some weird phenomenons happened in the night skies of north america, the movie itself even put senator john mccain in some kinda hearing, then the lousy movie started with a scare s..tless young woman running in the dark...then a r.v. full of young men and women, joking, laughing and...then the lousy screenplay began and just turned out to be another stupid rerun or replay of a ridiculous horror movie added some horrible aliens landing on earth, kidnapped and used these captured youngsters as experiments. the cliched ugly aliens used their long fingers scratched the front and back of the human beings to check out their internal physical structures, screamings their heads off when they were used as lab mice....what a lousy story, not even worths a penny to watch albeit really made it into a brain-dead movie. stay away from it, folks, even you could rent it for free."
1,Don't waste your time,"Within the first ten minutes, I hated everyone in this movie. I don't understand why recent movies have mean spirited people in it. Maybe I'm just getting old. These Hollywood jackasses' should realize that not everyone acts like THEM or their bratty KIDS. Cursing every five seconds, putting each other down every chance they get, Going for the POT as soon a the situation presents itself, drinking while driving. Give me a break.This is all within the first ten minutes. I would care less if they drove off a mountain by that point.I know it's only a movie, but movies reflect society and movies influence it as well."
2,OH PLEASE!,"A guy, who looks like a young version of Brad Pitt is driving across Arizona at night and is not on I-40. He was 3 great looking babes with him as well as another dude. They see lights in the sky, crash into another guy's truck. People get killed and abducted. Once abducted we go through the classic womb images normally associated with regression memory plus tall grays (one of 5 alien types for you UFOs people.) Mild violence, cleavage, and language. Not at all believable. Based on actual events? Oh Please!"
2,Not worth your time,"I really tried to like this movie. I gave it time, waiting for all the sexual drivel and bad acting to be replaced by some alien abduction action. At 45 minutes in, I threw in the towel.Night Skies is pretty much a bland alien/horror film with little to offer. bad acting. Slow moving plot. Little to no suspense. If you're looking for something to wet your alien/sci-fi whistle, tryAlteredinstead."
2,Don't waste your money,"First of all I wish I had paid better attention to the size. Six little bottles for the price I paid is ridiculous and its not a concentrate either. Secondly, IT DOESN""T WORK. I tried it on several items and it only took a few stains out. If you accidentally get rust on yourself working with tools or something it might be fine. If your one of us unfortunates who have crappy water that acts up now and then and ruins everything FORGET IT!! its useless."
1,Terrible translationl,"Dont' buy this, it's a very strange translation and basically unreadable. How did this get on Amazon anyway? I had to buy another copy as I couldn't read this translation."
1,Appalling translation,"I agree that this translation by James Waring is unreadable. The translator (who was English) cannot even construct a sentence in English, let alone translate from French into comprehensible English. This is the minimum one would expect from the translation of a classic foreign novel, as well as conveying the nuances and essence of the writing. I feel that it was cynical of Amazon to offer this as a ""free"" Classic. I'll have to find a better translation from another source."
3,A classic...,"Interesting reading, and it raised more questions than the movie...I guess bullying has always been in style. (nothing more to say, just bringing my total words up beyond 20)"
5,"Beautiful novel, exceptionally told.","As a student of literature I have read my fair share of books. So far, this is my favorite. It is incredibly emotional and I found myself completely attached to the narrator. I have not read the rest of the books in Arena's collection, what he calls the Pentagonia, but now I plan to do so. Read this book! It is worth your time."
5,Reinaldo the Great!,"This is the first novel by Reinaldo and his only work published in cuba. This is a fine work. It is in my opion not as easy as some of his other works. The language is in keeping with his other works such as The Assult, and The Brightest Star. The descritive, expressionist language can at times be complex but this is wonderfully readable. I have been working my way through Reinaldo's pentagonia and this must be read to understand the author. Marvelous."
5,great music,It was just really a super product. I don't know what else to say except that it's good music and deserves to be bought and listened to... so I did.
4,Well-done adaptation,"In my humble opinion, Mr. Cook & Co. did a good job adapting 'Call of Cthulhu' to the d20 system. The essence of the game's original concept remains unchanged, and the book itself is a fine job (it's worth its price).No doubt, the game looks more like D&D now, for the characters are more combat-like, and sanity is harder to lose. However, the Gamemaster (now) still has in his hands the power to control what does and does not happen in his world.Besides, this game keeps a really high mortality rate, and preserves that feeling of helplessness for its players.I give it four stars."
3,"3ED, plus Sanity","If you already play CoC, you don't need this book.The new version is simply the D20 rules (and in fact, almost all of 3E) with Sanity and Cthulhu Mythos pasted in directly - SAN checks etc are still percentile rolls, lower-the-better, and no attempt has been made to bring this (crucial) aspect of the game into the D20 frame of reference.Combat, skills, feats & spells all operate almost exactly the same way as 3E, with the one nod towards a more simple combat system being moving of attacks of opportunity to a ""variant"" rule rather than a standard one.Don't get me wrong - as a long term RPGer (20+ years) i think 3E is an excellent system, and D&D has benefited from a more robust rules system. Its just that CoC already had an excellent rules system, and was always far more a role-players game than a war gamers one."
1,Was Slightly Deceived by Description,"I thought these hoops would be better quality because of the price and description. However, they are very, very skinny and are held together with staples. They also don't weight much, so they are harder to use. I ordered them in hopes of them lasting several years, but I have already started using my old beat up hoops again. I have such a small budget at work, so I am disappointed that I wasted so much money on these hoops."
4,Great for toddlers,"My 2-year old loves these hoops - they are small and lightweight. I'm not sure how rugged they will be long-term, but great so far! Wish you didn't have to buy 12 at once..."
1,Too skinny hoops ... but nice responsive company!,"Each hoop is about as thin as a pen - only about 3/8"" thick! The entire stack of hoops is only a few inches high, not at all as shown in the description or photo. The company, eSportsOnline.com, was very helpful when I contacted them. Check out their website for lots of cool stuff. They said the photo should be updated soon to show very thin hoops."
5,Plants Jim Harter Illustrations,"This book is definitely a MUST have if you are an artist or love art. The drawings are in fine detail and you can learn a lot from these illustrations. I am a fine arts student in college and I have never seen drawings this fine in details. The book is a masterpiece. I would expect a book like this to cost eight times the price. I say buy it, worth it."
1,Doesn't include a disc,"The illustrations in this book are gorgeous. But when I see something that says ""Royalty Free"" in the year 2012 I would expect it to inlcude a CD with the images. I was surprised to receive this book without any type of disc. Who has the time to individually scan sketches from a book? The drawings are incredible and perfect for my needs, but unfortunately I don't have the time to scan each image and digitize it when I need them."
4,never enough,"Countervail is an amazing Hardcore band, the music is incrediably emotional for hardcore, tough, and deep, reaching all ends of the spectrum that hardcore seakers long to endure... but this E.P. cannot be your only experience with this band. The full length album ""the most abused word"" offers more, and will not fail to satisfy your burning desire for hardcore, with this E.P. is nothing but a tease into the heart of this band, surely not to be ignored, the full length, should be heard before this one."
4,Engineering Geology An Environmental Approach,"A very good book for introductory engineering geology. The author presents the information in an easy to read and understand format. I thoroughly enjoyed the authors use of actual situations and incidents to help the reader understand the concepts, applications and importance of the subject material. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest of attaining a basic understanding of engineering geology."
2,"Good text, Terrible Pictures","I purchased this textbook to use in a college course. The text of the book is good, but the quality of the pictures is completely unacceptable. The photographs are in black and white, and they appear grainy and unclear. Even with the captions, I frequently cannot even tell what the photos are trying to show. I will NOT be keeping this textbook after my course is over."
2,Good Delivery but Bad Qaulity Book Binding,"This book was delivered in due time. However, the binding on this book is terrible and split apart as soon as I opened the book for the first time."
5,Classic reference book,"This is the third edition of the Nutrition Almanac that I have purchased over the years.I find it an extremely valuable reference guide that I consult frequently. It has extensive information on vitamins, minerals, nutritional content of all the basic foods, health issues etc. It now also includes information on homeopathic remedies for a number of medical conditions...a welcome addition!I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in health and nutrition."
2,Smaller Book with Less Info than 4th Edition,"When I ordered this book, I was anticipating giving away my old 4th edition for a new one with improved information. NOT SO!The tables, the heart and soul of the book, have fewer foods and not more than the 4th edition. In a display of ignorant cost cutting, Carb counts for grains such as rice are given per cup of RAW not cooked product - same for macaroni whereas the 4th edition gives raw and cooked values. This alone makes it not worth the money but scattered throughout are foods that were there for 4th edition but are now gone.The publisher probably saved money by eliminating pages but I can no longer recommend this book to friends; I advise them to not buy it but get a copy of the 4th edition instead."
5,Concise and up to date information,"Arranged in such a way that it is easy to find specific topics. Information on each nutrient is concise and well presented. A good addition to any library, especially if you are interested in a healthier, more balanced approach to nutrition."
4,Warning: Rival crock pots contain lead in the glaze,I recently found out that Rival Crock Pots contain lead in the glaze. Because of this I can no longer recommend this item.
5,Best Crock Pot I have owned,"We own a 4 quart crock pot, but it is too small for some of the foods we liked to cook in it, and we have a large family. We researched several large crock pots and finally decided on this one because we got the most for our money. It has a keep warm option, which most of the older crock pots don't have. I find this option to be wonderful. You can cook a 10 lb pork shoulder in about 12 hours on low, and it fits entirely in the pot. We are very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Great for cooking, don't leave it on and forget it though","I really like this crock pot,it heats really nicely and the interior comes out for easy cleaning and/or putting into the fridge. I would never turn this on and leave the house for the day though, both low and high settings get pretty hot."
4,"It gets a little warm on the outside, But OK!","I like this cooker! The only thing wrong with it would be that the chrome surface of the cooker gets very hot, but common sence should prevail in this slight flaw."
2,burned every time,"I try to use my Rival crockpot once a week or so, but I'm highly discouraged. Whenever I follow a slowcooker recipe, it always comes out burned. I have a full time job away from home and can't hang around to babysit this thing, so I've found it a very frustrating tool. Sort of useful, but more often a near disaster.I was very glad to read the review about the ill fitting lid, perhaps that's my problem too. If I add several extra cups of water more than the recipe calls for then I usually come out OK, but even then sometimes I've come home to black-gooey-I'm-not-sure-what. I wish there was a crockpot fairy out there to give me advice on this one.I would recommend you look at other crockpots before purchasing this one. The feature I do like is that you can remove the crock for washing and refrigeration.I wish I could rate this with more stars, I had high hopes for my crockpot."
1,Don't buy this book!,"I have read all of the authors books in order and this book is not like the first books. It is very difficult to read. It is not a ""page turner"". Do not bother to purchase this book it is not worth the price. Skip the book in the series!"
3,Not her best,The mystery story was a bit laborious and predictable- not like her other stories. But the back story between the characters is interesting so if you are interested in their lives then you do need to read this book.
3,Playing for the Ashes,"Enjoyed this book, but not as much as many of her other books. However, she does as always get you involved in the characters, your heart goes out to some."
4,It brings a lot of entertainment,"It is a very good mystery novel. The characters are well conceived, the plot is genial, the end is sad but very logic.It goes beyond a typical police story. no bad guys - good guys stuff. Simply human"
5,Riveting,Lynley was at his most unorthodox behavior in this drama.... to persecute or not? Kept me up late one night to finish it.
2,Playing for Ashes,I usually enjoy Elizabeth George and read her when I want to relax. Maybe I didn't particularly enjoy this book as some of the descriptions just took too long and it was such a depressing story.
4,Good read from E. George,"Unique, interesting characters, tragically flawed individuals whose lives and actions leave them indelibly linked. Reminds us that control of our lives is illusive and that as humans we are, often to our discomfort, dependent on others for more than we care to admit."
3,Not as Good as the Prior Two,"George has made the error of focusing our attentions upon a non-recurring character, who is neither sympathetic nor interesting. One half of the story is consumed with a subplot that is only obliquely related to the mystery. If George wants to develop central non-recurring characters, she would do better to take as an example her character Elena in ""For the Sake of Elena"". I hope that her subsequent books do not repeat this error."
5,"More, more more!","This was the first Elizabeth George book I had an opportunity to read. Since then I have eagerly pored through the entire Lynley/Havers series, to the point of waiting for 353 other readers on the list at the library to get through her most recent one. I immediately fell in love with Tommy Lynley and Helen. They are so charming and misguided! The gruff Barbara Havers adds an additional level of poignancy and humor. I check Amazon every day in hopes that Elizabeth George somehow wrote a book that I missed somewhere along the way. If you haven't read one of her books yet, you are definitely in for a treat! She treats her readers with respect, and offers a well-rounded story in addition to a satisfying mystery. George has quickly become one of my favorite authors. I wish I could thank her."
3,"A Slow Start, But Still A Good Story","I had a little more of a hard time getting involved in this story as easily as the others written by Elizabeth George, mostly because I don't know the first thing about cricket, the sport which the late Hugh Patten played before he was murdered, and, as a listener, I lost interest for a while in the middle of the story. I mean, aren't we trying to find out who killed Hugh Patten? It's still a fascinating mystery after you peel away the other layers, but I'm not going to elaborate on those. Instead, listeners can discover them on their own."
5,"Poignant, complex, believable","As with all of her books, George not only exhibits her mastery of the mystery genre, she also shows her keen understanding of the human heart, of family dynamics across the social classes, of the power of jealousy and revenge. She also continues to build the relationships between her recurring characters by weaving them into the story in a way that will not confuse readers who haven't read her books before, which is a feat until itself. A great, sad, brilliant, satisfying story, well written and well crafted"
2,Skip this one,"Skip this one if you are an Elizabeth George fan. There is not one sympathetic character in the lot, save Lynley and Havers and Lynley doesn't come off that good. Olivia is despicable and goes on and on for pages that should have disappeared under the editor's red pen. I suppose no one dares edit George now that she is such a huge success. Pity. The rest of the characters are totally without redemption, especially Jimmy, who may have the filthiest mouth yet. A little British slang goes a long way. Every other word about procreation is just too much."
3,playing for the ashes,"In this mystery, champion English cricketeer Kenneth Fleming is found dead as a result of arson. Because he doesn't smoke, thescenario looks like possible arson. The suspects include his wife and eldest son, as well as the older teacher and mentor with whom he has a complex relationship. Half the book is narrated by the wayward daughter of the teacher, who is dying from ALS and whose troubled relationship with her mother she is pressed to resolve by her animal-rights activist boyfriend.As usual, George does parent-child dynamics very well. Less interesting is the relationship between Lynley and his upper crust wife, but perhaps I'm in the minority."
3,Stretching the story,"I found this book to be about twice as long as should have been. In some places the dialogue just went on and on and on. With so few exciting events, it was a pretty dull book. I've read other Elizabeth George books and usually enjoy them but, then, no one bats 1000 every time. Although the author is good at character development and surprise endings she throws in too many details and there is too much conversation between secondary characters. Next time I want to read an Elizabeth George book, I think I'll check it out at the library."
5,Playing for Ashes,"Elizabeth George is a wonderful, lyrical writer. She mixes murder with very human stories about her 5 main characters. I am rereading the entire series in order this time."
4,What a talent!,"This is the third George book I have read and I can certainly say that I did not come away disappointed. There are two story lines which, while related slightly, are played out at the same time and that always gets a little confusing to me. And she throws in some ""in your face"" smut, not that it's not realistic--it's just a little more than I care for, and also continues the development of Barbara Havers character in a kind of mini story of it's own. I found it a little slow in places and while I don't think it is necessarily better than her other books I've read (""Missing Joseph"", ""Well Schooled in Murder""), her remarkable talent is establishing her as one of the premier mystery writers of our time."
4,Solid,"I agree with others that parts of this book can be cliched (Olivia's ramblings) and cloying (Lynley's romantic struggles with Lady Helen), but this contains a solid mystery. It may be George's most character driven work and that, along with the many questions that surround the murder, make for good reading."
4,Great Plot--Poor Characters,"The character of Olivia in Elizabeth George's PLAYING FOR THE ASHES is just plain weird. Despite the intricate plotting and intricate story line it was a difficult book to finish.As a writer of romance Ms. George does not excel. Lynley and Helen seem pathetic cross matches rather than friends on the way to the alter. Maybe Ms. George should invest in a critical editor.PLAYING FOR THE ASHES is not the worst in this series, but it will run it a close second.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I gather from reading other reviews that Playing For the Ashes is typical of Elizabeth George's work, i.e. it features lengthy (and I mean really lengthy) digressions involving characters who may or may not end up being important in the end. George appears to have an excellent ear for British English. She does what she does very well, but if you prefer a fairly straightforward police procedural, you probably won't enjoy this."
4,"Good plot, fascinating characters","This book was a bit of a departure, style-wise, and I liked they way Olivia's story was developed separately from the rest of the story line then woven in. I was a little disappointed not to see Simon and Deborah in this book, and I didn't see the deeply layered themes that I normally find in George's books. That was particularly surprising given the promise of the fire imagery. But this is still an extremely worthwhile read with some interesting plot twists."
1,Terrible - over long,"I read the first 300 pages then gave up completely frustrated at the amount of time I had wasted. I skipped to the last few chapters to find out ""who dunit"" and even found the ending frustrating. The author has taken character development to the extreme, or even beyond. I was half expecting to come across a chapter about how Lynley cuts his toe nails, and how Havers reads some sort of class difference into this act. In summary don't waste your time reading this book. I have read other books by the same author and have always felt somewhat unsatisfied at the end, but this is by far the worst."
5,The best mystery novel I have ever read,"I have been a mystery reader for decades, and have probably read close to a thousand mystery novels. This is probably the best of them. George manages to delve into relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, professional colleagues, and various other combinations, with a penetrating and sympathetic insight. The mystery itself is not the most complex or difficult case that I have ever read about, but it is more than enough to keep the reader guessing and interested. The sheer beauty of George's writing is incomparable in the mystery field, but then anyone who has read one of her novels already knows that. It has become a cliche to praise a mystery novel by saying that it could stand on its own as a wonderful novel even without the mystery element, but this time the cliche is absolutely true"
3,Love blinds,"This is the first book I've read by this author. It was, to me, overly long and drawn out where it didn't need to be and presented so many unlikable/unsympathetic characters, that it took me a long time to finish it. There was a good mystery entangled in all of the excess. I have to ask though, what is the point of Helen? She's a vapid twit who made my skin crawl. Who on earth would want to be married to that? But then, maybe that's the point of this whole book is to examine twisted relationships and how love makes us look past even the most ""useless"" of people."
5,A STICKY WICKET,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable and superbly crafted book, in which two apparently disparate strands of narrative become woven together, albeit not altogether convincingly. That's to say, there is much reliance on coincidence, and at nearly 700 pages the plot is in danger at times of sinking under its own weight. But that is offset by the interplay between characters, particularly Inspector Lynley and D/S Havers, and you can always skip some of the more introspective passages and cut to the chase. But to give this less than five stars is an insult, particularly when you compare the quality of the prose to that of some of the best-sellers. Note to proof-readers: It's Belleek!"
4,Liked!,I liked this workout. The moves were challenging and increased my flexibity with constant use. I use 2 pound ankle and wrist weights to increase the intensity.My only complaint is that it tended to be a bit monotonous at times.
1,"Kries is into herself, not the workout","I found this entire program annoying. Jennifer Kries is more interested in showing off her range of motion than she is in instructing.Thankfully I was able to resell this on eBay and instead I purchased ""Pilates for Weight Loss"" by Gaiam. I'm much happier with this program, which offers a partially- and fully-modified workout in addition to the advanced workout."
5,Love the results!,"This is a great workout for toning and slimming down. I was trying to lose weight and was walking everyday with fair results. As soon as I started incorporating one of these 15 minute workouts into my routine 3 or 4 times a week I saw great results. I quickly felt toned all over and significantly slimmed my hips, thighs, and stomach as well as toned up my arms. I would definately recommend this routine! It has a great upbeat tempo and it is quick to accomplish."
3,Great Arms Workout!,"This video has a great 15 minute workout for arms...I've been using it for about three weeks and have definitely noticed a great difference. As for the rest of the three workouts..They are very advanced, and confusing. The instructor knows what she is doing, but doesn't take the time to explain the moves to the viewer."
3,Too quick for a good workout,"This video moved through the exercises much too quickly to actually get a good workout. As soon as I would start to feel the burn, the instructor was off to another move. I bought the video hoping for a Pilates workout and really did not enjoy the 15 minutes of ballet."
3,Not for beginners or slow learners,"I loved the concept and I bought the tape. Anything that encourages organic movement is worth a shot. The abs section was wonderful. It was a good strength workout, but also encouraged form, grace and flexibility. Upper arms were also interesting. I had a very hard time following the more ballet-like moves, based on balance and coordination (which I lack). I don't recommend this tape for beginners, but everyone else will enjoy a healthy, safe workout."
2,So-So,"This video was definitely different for me, since this is my first pilates workout, but I was not really impressed with this tape. First, during the crucial exercises when it would be helpful to see what the instructor is doing, the camera is never panned out enough to see what she is doing. Second, although I realize this is meant to be a short workout, the instructor does not spend enough time on proper technique, and I am often unsure as to whether I am performing the exercise properly. It is also intimidating to see 15 girls stretching their legs above their heads,when I can barely lift mine off the ground, with no encouragement from the instructor.Bottom line: this would probably be a good workout for people who are familiar with pilates, but I would not recommend it to beginners."
5,Love Kries Pilates,"I have been using Pilates ""The Method"" for years. It is somewhat dated, done in 90's... but look past that! It has the best basic pilate and ballet toning I have ever found. Takes alittle time getting the moves down... if you have never done basic pilates or ballet toning. Give yourself afew weeks to get it down and work thru the sore muscle days. I am never in such toned shape and if I slide back, tone back in no time. When I started out, did it 4-6 days aweek with walking in between. Within 6 weeks, down to 1-4 times a week and walking still. Try to take 1-2 days off in the week."
4,Fantastic!,"I've tried many different workouts for years, but none of them have had such rapid results like pilates! I have even tried Callanetics, (which has many moves from pilates) that was supposed to have fast results, but between that & Pilates, there is no comparison (unless I was doing the poses wrong..).I used the Pilates Method, Precision Pilates dvd before this one, & I love them both! It's a faster pace & I believe a little less reps than Precision Pilates, but still effective. I only dock this one star, bc I wish there were a few more workouts for the abs section.I enjoy working out with Jennifer Kries in her dvds. She shows her personality, but is calm & relaxing in the workouts (Unlike some videos, where the instructor is bouncing off the walls with a high screechy voice..). She takes the time to explain the poses & you can hear her breathing, which helps you learn how to breath properly for each workout.All-in-all, great dvd!"
2,Good for Dancers,"A lot of her stuff is repetative. 2nd, She takes at least 2 -3 minutes of the beginning of all 15 min with breathing and explanation. 3rd, the HIPS and THIGHS works outs are almost exaclty the same.And also the excercises in these 2 are almost ALL Ballet.A lot of ballet.This video is from 2001 too. I'd try something more up to date.I didnt feel the abs work out did much, i felt like i was doing an 80's jazzercise class. The only good thing is the ARMS routine."
2,not beginner level,"I bought this dvd after deciding to try something new, I had been doing the crunch pick your spot pilates workout and after buying this one, was completely lost. I found myself trying to catch up and missing excersizes. This dvd assumes you are already flexible and can keep up with the poistions at an extremely fast pace. i only suggest this for advanced workout students."
3,good for light days,I liked the background music. this is a good tape for low impact days between heavy workouts. sometimes she changes activities too quickly before you get a change to really work into it. Some of the rolling movements are hard on the back. The ballet work is a great conditioner for the legs. I enjoy the format.
4,upbeat pilates workout,"A big improvement from the Precision Toning workout. I was turned off by pilates after trying precision toning. (A real sleeper for a pilates newcomer.) However, I found this workout to be upbeat and quick moving. A great introduction to pilates with alot of ballet movements. It was easy to follow yet challenging enough to keep on using. I feel better already!"
2,good moves but not enough workout,"The instructor does a good job of showing how the moves are done, but as far as a true work out is concerned, it doesn't do the the job. This is great for BEGINNERS but after 2 weeks you will need something else."
2,Not quite what's it's advertised to be,"The name ""Pilates"" is in large, bold print on the case of this video which I found to be misleading. It's not Pilates that you're buying but The Method. (OK - if I had read the whole case I might have figured that out.) I didn't like the drumming, I found it more irritating than helpful. Jennifer quickly switches between movements with little instructions about how to perform them. Definitely *not* a beginners tape and not one I would have bought if I had known what I was getting."
5,exactly what i needed,"bought this to extend a a pull cord for a light in the garage, works just as described, as long as it says, and seems durable, i'm happy."
4,LOVE this dispenser!,"I purchased this dispenser to use for my company [...] . It works fantastic to load the Cake-Muffin batter into the mini-loaf cups. I gave it a 4 star rather than a 5 ONLY because the batter seems to leak a bit into the bottom of the handle. For everyday household use this probably wouldn't be an issue; but I use it for mass quantity therefore in the end it starts to leak. By the way, the construction quality is way more than expected. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Makes breakfast less messy,"We bought this for aebleskiver and pankajer, traditional Danish breakfasts. This made dispensing the somewhat runny batters much less messy and easier to be consistent with the sizing."
1,Poor quality control,"While the unit appears to of fine quality - made of stainless steel, I cannot recommend this item at all. I requested this as a gift to me based on the recommendations here on Amazon. On the first and only use, batter leaked all over, up on the bottom slide. On closer inspection, where the handle assembly connects to the bottom, it was apparent that the company has crap for quality control. The gap where the valve meets the canister was way to large. This is too bad. It really looked like this device would work well. Like others, the mess was worse than the old ladle method. Rather than deal with returns (it was a gift to me), I attempted to fix its flaw, but no luck. This unit is going to the trash."
1,Not drip proof??,Thought to buy the better one of the options and what a mistake. The bottom of the dispenser was dripping everywhere. I will go ahead now and purchase a cheaper one from another company.
1,not what I expected,I purchased this for use at a church fundraiser pancake breakfast based on reading reviews by others who purchased same; the capacity would not have been adequate for the purpose; the dispenser mechanism was flimsy and wouldn't have lasted 10 minutes; I sent it back.
3,would not buy again,Sorry for being short ... I haven't the time for a good review ... but I would not buy again at this price.More later maybe ...
1,Poor quality makes for a big mess.,I purchased this dispenser thinking it was more heavy-duty and would last for some time. From the beginning the batter ran out of the bottom hole and all over the table. Apparently the shutoff isn't tight enough.
2,"works well, but it rusted after the second time","I saw something like this in France and I really wanted one. I picked this one because it's stainless steel and could go in the dishwasher. it's really beautiful and it works, made great muffins without spills (if the batter is fluid). but after the second time I used it, it's already rusting in different parts. Disappointing. I am returning it."
4,"Doesn't drip, but rusted after one trip through the dishwasher","This dispenser has made making cupcakes SO much easier and faster than using spoons or measuring cups to pour the batter. However, it rusted after one wash in my dishwasher. I'll hand wash it from now on and hope it doesn't get worse!"
4,Works great,I would have given a 5 star rating but when I opened the package and took it out I noticed pancake batter on the bottom of it. Wasn't going to keep it but thought I'd give it a try after I washed it. Worked great with only one little drip on the paper plate I put under it. The secret to the batter not dripping out is you should make up the batter ahead of time and put it in the fridge for about half an hour to 45 mins. to thicken.
5,works great,"This has made my pancake/waffle making experience much easier. Works well, if you make your batter thin you get a few drips but nothing major. Easy to clean. Well made."
4,This is very cute,My daughter loves fairy tales and I am always looking for something new...this was very cute and she just loved it...it has all the makings of a classic fairy tale...
2,It could have been a great movie...,"This cartoon reminds me of the style of cartoons that use to be on CBS Storybreak when I was little. The story and the way the characters look is wonderful, but the way they are animated and voiced seems a little 'off'. I get the feeling if they had had a little more money to make and polish this movie it could be as good as something Don Bluth made (the style of drawing humans reminds me a little of him) or something like Quest for Camelot and be not just a made for tv movie."
1,dissapointing,"For an editor of Upside and Forbes, the writing in this book is surpisingly amateurish and predictable. It jumps around a lot and doesn't really deliver anything insightful or interesting, and so I found it not worthwhile."
2,Not a good story book,"Well, here I am, after reading the book for about two weeks every morning, and I am left with no deep impressions about either Sun or Scott.The book appears to be a collection of newspaper articles. My first impression from the title of the book was that it talks a lot about Scott McNealy, which the author clearly failed to achieve. I guess the author could have rather written two books - a biography on Scott and business history of Sun. The book fails to achieve either of these satisfactorily.I was hoping to know a lot about Java and Solaris, and although there were three chapters dedicated to Java, they didnt leave a lasting impression on me. The author seems to be unaware of other battles going around which would give Java a tough time to evolve.Finally, the book doesnt really form a story. Its more like every chapter can be read almost independent of each other."
4,Very interesting story,"A fascinating, inside look at the making of Sun Microsystems and its founder Scott McNealy. Includes insightful and entertaining interviews from many of the key high-tech players in Silicon Valley. This book is a great read; I really enjoyed it."
2,Boring,"One of the most boring books I have ever read. I love Sun Micro, but this seemed to much of a promotional book for Wall Street analaysts than anything. Its a timeline of events, and a very boring one at that. I could not wait to finish it."
4,Not as strong as Fast Fingers but still holds it's own,This album is not as strong as Jimmy Dawkins first album Fast Fingers. None-the-less though this is still a pretty good album. Not every song on Blisterstring is a power house but that dirty muzzled guitar sound is still strong on every track. If this is the first Jimmy Dawkins album your looking to buy do yourself a favor and buy Fast Fingers first (it's a better album and cheaper). If your looking for your next step after Fast Fingers pick up this album because even though it was not the next one Dawkins recorded it is the next one where his presence is strongly felt (this is due to the fact that he only sings on a few of the songs on his 2nd album).
3,Memory upgrade for Compaq laptop,"Upgrading the memory in my laptop did not entirely deliver the performance enhancement I hoped for. While I do believe that I have extended the useful life of my computer by being able to open multiple applications at the same time, or by running more complex applications, the addition of more memory did not greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to execute most commands or to load graphics. In fact, it takes a lot longer to even boot up now because of the increase in memory. So, despite all that is advertised, additional memory is not necessarily a cure-all for an ""old"" processor that's just plain slow."
2,Not the quality I expected,"These bowls had several manufacturing flaws. A rough edge here, a bubble there in the finish, a wave in the top edge, etc... not the quality I had expected. The bottoms are marked Reco International (not Romertopf) and ""Made in China"". I'm going to keep them as they will work and it is too much hassle to return a 40 dollar item."
4,ceramic mixing bowls,"One of them had a small chip in it, but even with that, these are very pretty bowls. They're a bit too heavy though, that's why i took off a star. The biggest one is great for mixing salads or dough. The smallest is good for whipping up egg whites or a small amount of dry ingredients."
4,underated Astaire,"This is probably one of Astairs most underated musicals. Sure it's ""OLD FASHIONED"", but it's charming none-the-less.While Leslie Caron may not be his best partner, she is nontheless delightful. The music is memorable even if the plot isn't. First rate support is turned in by Fred Clark and especially Thelma Ritter. The production is first class all the way and the ending is super. Should be seen in wide-screen. Alas, it's pan and scan. Be sure and treat yourself and your family to the wonderful musical."
3,"Yes, but ...","Must be (obviously) that times were different in the '50's. Mr. Astaire (and Mr. Kelly) were quite senior to the lovely Ms. Caron; this made it difficult to accept the 'plots' of 'Daddy...' or 'American...'. Perhaps that is not the point; the dancing and the music is outstanding. That is what counts, I know. Still, the 'age thing' is like a tiny grain in one's eye; it can be quite distracting. Ms. Charisse seems the 'better' partner for both men; although both ladies are superior performers. Wonderful dancers; wonderful music."
2,Astaire tried to do the best he could with this script,"It's just that the script was really flimsy to begin with. A college-bound orphan, even one from Paris, would be a little more street-wise. Instead, we get an overgrown child who spends an inordinate time writing to her benefactor. She is angry that she has not heard from him during much of her college enrollment.Frankly, I don't find that a plausible development at all.Instead of getting involved on campus, or seriously attending to her studies to make attending college academically worthwhile--she's pouting. Really, she should be grateful that she's even getting to attend college and won't have to worry about how it's being paid for.This film made me feel sorry for Fred Astaire--who obviously has awesome dance moves.I can't believe an agent actually encouraged him to take this part. Sure it was a showcase for his dancing, but some of the lines which he had to utter besides were pure camp. The guy deserved better!"
2,FOX HITS SOME RATHER WEAK NOTES,"In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda, The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and Judy."
2,"too gray, bad music and Leslie Caron styled unflatteringly","There's a reason that this movie didn't make it onto the A-list of Hollywood movies. The movie is painted in a gray wash throughout and Leslie Caron is styled so awkwardly and inappropriately that I am more reminded of the travails she suffered as a small child in Nazi occupied France than in the prettiness of Gigi. If Ronald Reagan had been cast as Jimmy, the outcome of this May-December romance would have beyond unbelievable."
5,May The Motivational Forces Be With You!,"Writing memorable characters for your books, plays and scripts isn't easy. But Pamela Jaye Smith's book INNER DRIVES certainly has given us ample food for thought which will go far in helping all writers to create personalities that are believable, relatable and unforgettable. She leaves no internal or external stone unturned as she explores not only the eight classic centers of motivation, but also dares to list some probable physicalities -- from food to fashion to verbal faux pas which can help to set your characters apart! Writers of all areas will greatly benefit from this book."
5,A deeply moving portrait of a songwriter,"The music in this show consists of a group of unrelated and previously unrecorded songs written by Ed Kleban (the lyricist for Chorus Line, but really a songwriter). The writers have done a masterful job of combining these songs into a show that tells the story of Kleban's life. This is not a musical revue but a fully conceived musical.One can talk about the individual songs, and many of them are great. The ballad The Next Best Thing To Love is one of the best I've heard in a while. But what really make this work shine is the portrait the show paints of Kleban, a toubled man who had various breakdowns and loves, but for whom songwriting was the real love that made life worth living. You don't always like him, but that only makes him real. By the time you hear the beautiful and heartbreaking last song, Self Portrait, you have come to know and love Kleban through his music, which is exactly what he would have wanted. This album haunts me."
2,Unhappy End,"I first met Ed Kelban in 1965 as a member of Lehman Engle's BMI Musical Theater Workshop. He was the star of the class, wrote the brightest, freshest songs -- but alas, they have not aged well at all. The songs on this CD sound dull, generic and dated; I find myself asking, ""What was it we all heard back then, and why isn't it there anymore??"" There's no answer to that; art is elusive and is effects can be fleeting. Kleban was complex and troubled, and came to an embittered and unhappy end. It would have been wonderful if ""A Class Act"" had somehow served as a triumphant finale, but sadly, not."
4,Life of Kleban,"A CLASS ACT is one of the more unusual musicals produced in the past few decades, a tribute to the works of a man who is known essentially for just one piece, but that one groundbreaking - A CHORUS LINE. This musical is basically a collection of trunk songs, unpublished songs, etc. by Kleban and was put together in his memory after his death. Most of the songs are forgettable or at least minor, compared to the works of his contemporaries, but the show's book writers, Linda Kline and Lonny Price, have done a fine job melding these disparate pieces into an autobiographical chamber piece. Kleban was by all accounts a difficult person to live and/or work with, but his legacy will remain as long as A CHORUS LINE is produced throughout the world."
5,BEST MUSICAL EVER!!!!!,"I have seen many musicals and this is by far the best. Not the typical characters. But still Love it. And for any one that says this is corny or fake. i know for a fact that the whole musical is A TRUE STORY. Everyone in it is real. Buy the CD, See the show! Its WELL worth the money.... I hate to say it but i like it BETTER then a Chorus Line. Favorite songs: Under Seperate Covers, Light on my feet and gauguins shoes,!"
3,Wireless mouse,I just purchased a second one from Amazon because I like this mouse better than any other mouse that I've ever used when it works. The tiny track ball is great but is almost impossible to clean when it becomes flaky. I killed my first one trying to clean the trackball.The right mouse button is problematic. It is necessary to remove your hand from the mouse and just touch the right mouse button to get it to work.Would I buy another one......I just did.
3,Pretty but flaky,The mouse looks beautiful. Left & right click work as expected and squeeze and middle buttons are nice extras.BUTThe trackball is unreliable (worked fine for a couple of months but now downward scrolling barely works). And it hogs the batteries.Expected something more reliable at these prices.
5,Great!!!!,"Best wireless mouse that i ever have. The bluetooth connectivity is awsome....Works great in any surface that i try,,,including black shinny desk"
2,Would be 5 stars except for the scroll ball,"This is a great mouse in every way save one: the scroll ball has a limited life for all practical purposes. Once it gets dirty (and just like the old pre-optical ball mice, the scroll ball, made of hard rubber, eventually gets dirty), the scroll bar becomes unreliable and then, eventually, useless. Apple's recommended cleaning techniques are ineffective; they might work for 30 minutes or so, but that's it. Though I'm a diehard Mac guy, I'm replacing this with something from Logitech or Microsoft. Too bad, because the design is very elegant and effective in every other respect."
2,not great if you right click a lot,"While for folks who have lived in Appleland for a long time - this might look like a big improvement; coming from windows, I was underwhelmed.I just moved from Windows to a Mac and am still in the habit of right-clicking a lot. That was one big reason why I bought this mouse instead of using what came along with my iMac. Unfortunately, it misreads a lot of my clicks.It seems, hardware wise there is only one button on this mouse and the software is supposed to guess (I imagine based on where you press) if its a right click or left click.This may be very elegant looks-wise but the software is not nearly as ideal as the hardware would be. It considers too many of my left clicks as right clicks and vice versa.2 stars for good compatibility with all mac products and nice looks but I wont recommend it."
1,Buy something else,"AFter a few months of use, the track ball started behaving badly. Needed constant cleaning. Now, cleaning doesn't help and the track ball won't scroll at all. Very poor design."
4,OK Mouse,"Overall I like the mouse. I like the use of the buttons and scroll wheel. Side buttons is a bit hard to press because you have to use some pressure but nice to have. (I just wish it can be set to a ""back"" function when I'm browsing the net.)The only flaw I see is the weight of the mouse. It feels very light and kinda cheap. Some people may like that but I find it that a mouse with some weight feels better and generally has a smoother control."
3,Handy mouse,"This is a handy tool for people who don't like a touch pad. However, beware, the back panel (for the battery) comes off easily. Battery life isn't very long, either. But on the whole is about average."
1,Scroll ball will not work for long!,"I have the wire version on this mouse. The scroll ball gets skin oil and dirt or dust on it and ceases to function in one or more directions. I took my mouse to the Apple store for help. They showed me how to ""clean"" the ball by inverting the mouse and rolling the ball over a cloth. Sure enough, this works for 30 minutes to a hour before the scroll ball will no longer fully work.Various web sites recommend everything from cleaning the ball with alcohol to taking the mouse apart for cleaning. I recommend just buying a mouse with a scroll wheel. I bought a wireless Iogear mouse. It does not scroll horizonally but is reliable."
3,"Good, when you find one that works.","First one I had wouldn't right click no matter what I did. It would always see a right click as a left click. Returned it and bought a second one that works great. I really like the mouse, but it seems that there are a few that are just bad eggs."
2,"Doesn't last, scrolling wheel quits working",I've had two of these now and this will be my last one. The scrolling wheel quit working on both after about 18 months. It will still scroll up and sideways but not down which is what you do the most. I love Apple but their peripherals frequently leave much to be desired in terms of quality of construction.
2,you can do better,"You can do better than the Apple wireless mouse. Use a Logitech bluetooth mouse, for example. It'll be cheaper, have more choices for buttons, and be a little more intuitive."
4,Great but needs attentioon,"This is my 3rd mighty mouse-prior ones gave up scrolling capability--seems the ball gets jammed but when the mouse works, it is sensational. There is a knack to keeping the ball clean and mobile--Just hold on to your receipt!"
1,Short-lived,"I actually liked this at first. First it doesn't allow for right-clicking and I really missed that, but I liked it otherwise. After about a month, it would randomly stop working. Sometimes I could restart the computer and it would come back. Then about 5 months into it, it just stopped working. I tried to reinstall it - there's no way to do that. I tried to call Apple for help - they make it sound so convenient - just put in your info and someone will call you right away or you can set up a time to talk...but the next screen asks for the serial number - it turns out my mighty mouse's serial number is invalid. Oh, and they warned me that I might be charged for it if I got in touch with them. What a rip off!!"
2,Scrolling sticks and eats batteries,"The scroll function constantly gets stuck and you have to clean the little rubber ball all of the time to try to fix it. Of course, being made by Mac there is no easy way to disassemble it to do this the right way. Also, it chews through batteries extremely fast. I've had other wireless mice and haven't had to replace the batteries nearly as much. I do like the size and that it matches my Mac but I'm looking for a replacement as I'm sick of having to deal with it and buying so many batteries. For a Mac product and its hefty price tag, I expect a lot more."
2,"Tracking Skips, Left click sometimes becomes right click","I've had this mouse for a couple of years now. First, the mouse started getting jumpy. It would go through batteries like no one's business so I switched to a wired mouse. I rediscovered it, and started using it; it was working good, until recently; now when I left click, sometimes it registers as a right click. It's so annoying!"
2,I wish it was better,"I was reading reviews here and people mentioned that it right clicks but is hard to get to work. I never realized that it right clicks because I can never make it work. It is very uncomfortable in the hand, and I have small hands. I like the scroll wheel but it will only work for a few months then stop working in one direction. (I am on my second one) I wish there was more choices for bluetooth mice, but most seem to be small and designed for notebooks. So I am stuck with this one. Matches my computer, but that is the best thing I can say about it. I love my old logitech USB mouse I have on my PC, but I don't want a dangle hanging out of my iMac, so I use this."
3,Not a bad mouse but might be better ones for Mac,"Not a bad mouse. I've used it on a MacPro, the MacBook pro, and the new iMac. It feels OK and do like the small scroll ball. I found no problem with right clicking. On the down side, it isn't has reponsive as the higher resolution MX 1000 laser mouse and there is a design flaw that occasionally causes the bottom of the door that holds the batteries which results in the batteries flying out on your desk or work area. Some have mentioned ""Steermouse"" driver but all fail to mention it is $20 more making this mouse close to a $100. Overall, I would recommend something like the MX 1000 which is more responsive although it is not bluetooth but is rechargeable unlike the Apple MM. I think the Apple MM is a good choice if you want a mouse for PS3 (it does work with it)."
1,Problematic Mouse,"I was dissapointed with the Mighty Mouse. I like the right click function and the scroll ball, but the mouse has been buggy from the start. Right click would not always work, and I would lose bluetooth connectivity every few minutes. Very frustrating. If it worked well, I'd recommend it."
2,Big disappointment from Apple,"I went to the Mac Superstore here to test this baby out hoping to get one for my new MacBook. What a disappointment; it has no weight to it making it feel unstable, the scroll ball was a good idea with very poor execution, and the right mouse button has to be the worst example of such I have ever seen. The entire mouse is the button, but it senses right and left click by which side has a finger on it when it clicks. This is annoying because you have to remember to lift your left finger to right click otherwise it just registers as a left click. Don't buy, I'm generally an Apple fanboy but this was an embarrassment. Fire the guy that designed this one Steve."
3,Nice but not GREAT,"I like my Mighty Mouse, it does what it's meant to... The only cons i get is that the side buttons are in fact... VERY uncomfortable, you need to apply really more pressure on it than i would expect... i don't use them anymore.and.. yes, if you've lost the connection with the computer, it'll take sometime to reconnect... i really rather using a corded mouse... it saves time and after all, the cable it's not that annoying."
2,Not what I thought.,"God I miss Mouseworks. The only good thing about this mouse is the scroll ball. The tracking is slow. Sometimes when I right click with secondary, it doesn't work. I have to go to preferences and click the option for right click to make it work again. The side buttons are of no use for me. No options to copy and paste (I use spreadsheets alot). I see there is shareware that adds some more abilities to this mouse, but if I purchase it, I'll damn near have a 100 dollar mouse. I also bought a wireless keyboard. It is great. It logs on to bluetooth pretty fast. This mouse, I have to open bluetooth sometimes to get it recognized. Maybe a software update by Apple would help. If not, I may go back to my old trusty Kensington."
2,Right click is tricky,"After two weeks of use, I returned the mouse because 3 out of 4 times I tried to make a right click, it would not work. I eventually got frustrated and decided to return it.I'm sure it has to do with the way I use the mouse but I'm not planning on changing my angle or whatever it is that makes it fail. I think a regular 2 button mouse is just perfect.I wish this mouse had a real mechanical right button because it would be perfect.I LOVED the scroll wheel and will miss it greatly."
4,good enough,"This mouse works well and is fairly accurate, I'm happy to useit but it is a huge consumer of batteries, I put them rechargeables (thank goodness) but only last (in my case) two to three weeks"
4,How to clean your mouse ball,"Many of the reviews are negative because the mouse ""stops working in one direction"" or some similar symptom. Most of the time this is due to dirt getting onto the sensors.Here's how to clean it. Forget the alcohol. Forget removing the ball.Get a clean sheet of white printer paper.Turn your mouse off, then turn it upside-down.Place the mouse on the paper (upside-down) so that only the ball is touching the paper.Using FIRM pressure, roll the mouse in all directions on the paper - in circles, in lines. After a bit of time, you should see little black specs on the paper, if your mouse was dirty.Roll the mouse this way for about a full minute.Now turn it back on and try it. It should work like new.Do this every time your mouse starts acting up.I used one of these for years, and was constantly frustrated until I found this solution. I now use the Magic Mouse, for which there are no issues relative to the ball, but it has its own issues."
1,Buy a mouse that works!,"I am a mac fan, perhaps pointlessly so since i've encountered so many problems with apple hardware. i had the wireless mouse for no more than two months when the scrolling became completely inoperative. it still seems to sync with my computer (i.e. the device is still recognized), but i can't move my cursor at all. utterly useless piece of junk. as other users have commented, design trumped functionality here. and don't expect any assistance or sympathy from apple support."
1,ditto on scrolling problems,"The 3 star overall rating on this product has to be from people who just bought one. I loved it at first, but now have scroll ball that only works in the up direction. Back to logitech for me"
1,The worst thing Apple ever did,"This is by far the worst mouse I've ever owned and it's unbelievable that Apple is still producing it. The scroll ball dies on you after a couple of months and there is no way to clean the dirt that gets accumulated inside since this mouse is sealed and impossible to open without breaking it and gluing it together afterwards (and then breaking it yet again a couple of months after that to clean the new dirt). Seriously, this is an offense to Apple consumers!"
1,Don't buy it,"I can't believe this product is still on the market. It is heavy, tracks like a car through mud and the scroll wheel problem is unbelievable. Apple should know better than to release something like this. I pretty much purchased it relying on Apple's reputation and boy did I learn my lesson. Have had macs for 20 years and never have I been this disappointed with one of their products. But like others said, I got addicted to horizontal scrolling before it got too sticky, and would no longer scroll down--went back to my Kensington wheel mouse. But truth be told, it was never very accurate when doing any kind of graphics or text insertion--always very sluggish and heavy like you were moving a can of tuna across your desk.Can't wait till we have some more choices with horizontal scrolling--sure miss it with Excel."
3,Expensive soap...,"I needed a mouse that doesn't occupy a USB port on my MacBook Pro since there are only two so the only possible solution was a bluetooth mouse. It wasn't a bad deal for $69 but it is still overpriced.Pros:- personally I like the design, look and feel of this mouse- worked perfectly out of the box, no hassle with installation- responsive, precise trackingCons:- price (if you want cheaper BT mouse check out the Logitech V470 which is $40 only)- the side buttons are not responsive- right click is almost impossible, you have to learn how to do it and you can go up to 70% hit rate. If you want to use it on other surface than your desktop don't even bother with right click... If you really need this option (Windows on your Mac) better if you check out the above mentioned Logitech or others before you spend money on the Mighty Mouse.Would I buy it again? No...So I rate it only 3 stars..."
2,"scroll wheel is not durable, but otherwise a nice mouse","I'm unfortunately on my 3rd wireless Mighty Mouse in under 2 years. The problem with the first two was the scroll wheel stopped working. Both had the same issue - it would stop scrolling in one direction, then shortly after it would stop scrolling in both directions. Luckily I did get the extended warranty with my iMac so the replacements have been free.Otherwise the mouse is really nice, and I like the double side button feature so you can pull up all open windows and choose the one you want to be active.The wireless work great, so that's another positive."
2,Hate it. Don't use it.,"I'd go 1 star but for the fact that it is beautiful and the bluetooth works flawlessly.What's frustrating to me is the software, or I *guess* that's the problem. I simply have to move the darn thing too far for the movement I want on the screen and I have it adjusted to the maximum for that dimension. I would think a decent software upgrade could fix the problem and I don't know what Apple is waiting for."
4,"Great Mouse, Great Support (was: Weak Range)","I bought this mouse as an upgrade from an Apple Wireless mouse (one button, LED, bluetooth).This mouse is infinitely superior in terms of functionality. Awesome tracking, ""three"" buttons, integrated Expose. Nice. The scroll ball is absolutely brilliant.The problem with this mouse is that the range and sensitivity to interference are terrible. It stutters when it is ten feet from the Mac. It won't really work at all if it's near any other wireless device. I used the old wireless in the exact same configuration as the Mighty, and it had none of the problems.Highly recommended if it's going to be within arms reach of your Mac and you don't use any other wireless gear in this band.UPDATE: I ended up taking it to the Apple Store, and they replaced it because they couldn't get it to pair with any Mac in the store. The replacement (the new rev with the white semi-circles on the sides) works perfectly! I'd change the rating to 5-stars if Amazon would let me."
1,Scroll=Junk,"I have had an apple imac for nearly 5 months now, and everything has worked in perfect order, except for the mouse. i have read many other complaints by people who say that the scroll stopped working, which is exactly what happened to mine. at first it could not go down, now it can neither scroll down nor up.It sucks.Don't buy it unless you only need it for 3-4 months. make apple fix this problem."
2,Sucky second hand mouse,"I am not satisfied with my order at all. The mouse that I recieved, was a little dirty and not completely functional. I should have expected worst for the product being a second hand item. The roller doesn't work well. It only goes down but rarely goes up. Even when it does move down I have a hard time with it. I would not buy from this person again. I would also not recommend getting a second hand mouse since I had this awful experience with it."
3,Nice look & hand feel but otherwise bad design,"The mouse looks great and feels good in the hand, but there are several design flaws, which are serious if you are used to 3-button work.1. Right-clicking is imprecise.2. The scroll ball is flimsy. Up-down works well, left-right only intermittently. (I have been lucky with being able to clean the scroll ball so far -- running it upside-down over paper.)3. The middle-click (on the scroll ball) is impossible without scrolling at the same time.4. The batteries are hard to extract. (There is no recharging station setup, of course.)5. There is only one additional button (the side bar).Functionally, my old Logitech mouse was much better -- but I do like the look of this one better. Can't there be good looks with brains, too?"
2,Button Errors,"I owned this mouse for a few days. I purchased this mouse for the number of buttons, the scrollball, and the beautiful design. Occasionally triggering the squeeze function accidentally I could live with, but it would regularly misread a right click as a left click. Not once or twice, here and there, but about half the time, a right click would register as a left click.I really appreciate the design aesthetic, I really do. I like having the single plastic shell, but it hampers the functionality to such an extent that I returned it. For the premium price, I'd expect to get a device that does everything it advertises and does it well. Maybe in the next generation."
1,The worst mouse I've ever used,"Horrible mouse, the wheel/ball in particular is not precise at all. Get a decent Logitech with a real scroll wheel for a lot less money -- you'll be a lot more satisfied. This was given to me at work with a new Mac Book Pro. I gave the mouse back after a week and bought a Logitech MX mouse out of my own pocket, that's how bad this thing is."
1,This mouse is the worst thing apple has ever made,"Now, I've been an apple fan for several years now. I love them. When this mouse came out, I was so excited, and ran out to buy one.That was a mistake.After having it for about a week, the little scroll ball stopped scrolling down. It still scrolled up fine, and side to side, but would not scroll down, no matter how much I cleaned the ball or anything.One day, I replaced the batteries because they were almost dead. BAM! I could scroll again!I finally realized that once the battery level gets lower than about 65%, the scroll down stops working. Why? No one knows. Not even apple. Because I had the mouse for so long before I figured out what the problem was, Apple was unwilling to help me.After having this mouse for about a year and a half, I just destroyed it. It works almost as good now as before I ripped it apart! ;)Please save yourselves a lot of trouble and avoid this product! I wasted $70!"
1,poor mouse,"The worst Apple product I have ever bought. It ghost all over my imac. Moves when I am not touching it and Apple cannot or will not help me. I have gone back to using a cheap wireless mouse that works much better, but not very well."
2,apple mouse,"I have a difficult time getting it to work. When the light is flashing, the mouse fails to work."
1,Poor design ... Again.,"Apple seems to have no concept of ergonomics when it comes to mouse deign. Everyone remembers the Hockeypuck mouse design on the original imac and this on is not much better. It's about as erconomic as a bar of soap, and the one piece body design makes it very easy to accidentally click when you don't want to. The pea sized scroll ball is pretty much worthless. Do yourself a favor and buy a logitech or even ... dare I say it... a microsoft mouse. Your hands with thank you."
4,Good bag for the money,"If you have a big DSLR like the Canon 40D/50D or Nikon D300, this is just right. It fits the body with a medium size zoom lens attached. But you don't get much more room for anything else other than another lens and flash. I use it on my hike, not too bulky and does not look too geeky like most camera bags."
4,Nice bag. A little smaller than I thought.,This bag is nice. Its a little smaller than I thought. It holds everything I need to carry when shooting as long as I plan to only take what I need. If you have a lot of zoom lenses they may not all fit properly.All in all this is a good bag. Next time I buy a bag I will most likely upgrade to a bigger bag.
2,Lacking Protection,"Bought this bag and am returning it.Pros:-Configurable interior compartments.-Design is OK. Not super stealth but pretty inconspicuous.-Fairly large front pouch for accessories.-Easy to get to camera.-Roomy.Cons:-Too easy to get to camera/equipment. Even when shut as tight as possible, you can easily reach in from the side and grab your camera. This was the deal breaker for me. I can just see water/dust making it's way into the main compartment.-Almost no padding on the top cover (where your LCD is facing up).-Kinda cheap build quality. OK for the price but the materials definitely seemed kinda cheap to me.-Loud velcro closure on for main compartment. A negative if you want to open this bag in a quiet area.I would not recommend this bag and am surprised that it has so many good reviews."
3,not so good,"the handle on the bag seems badly designed as when you hold it to carry your bag, the bag is not balanced."
2,Poorly Designed Bag,"I had a Tamrac bag for many years that I loved and needed to replace. This was the closet to my old bag, but after buying it I returned it. Several reasons. First and most important, the inside is poorly designed because the top velcro strips are too high on the inside of the bag. This forces the camera to sit up too high. Second, the dividers themselves do not allow enough flexibility. In my old bag, I could keep my camera with lens sideways, whereas this bag forces you to put the camera with the lens down. Third, the material is stiffer than it needs to be. There is enough padding to allow for a little smoother material. All in all, a disappointment."
3,Nice bag for normal use,"This bag good for normal use only. Not for adveture like hiking or travelling, due to lack of padding. Fit DSLR camera with zoom lens and 2 extra lens -> zoom + wide angle (fit better without lens hood), charger and memory cards. Side pockets are very tight to be useful for anything then slim cellphone (if you loaded the bag as above). Quick access to camera is nice."
4,great value,"It's a good item. I used it for my new D300+17-55/2.8, and it still have space for another lens(ex. 85/1.4). Shipping is not fast but still ok. If you have 70-200/2.8 lens, you might be hope a bigger bag."
4,Good bag for the hobbyist photographer,"Perfect fit for my Nikon D80 with 135mm lens (attached) and video/charging cords, with little space left over.Pros: Comfortable to carry and looks like a normal messenger bag in case you don't want everyone around you to know that you're a tourist. Lots of little compartments, and good rain protection. Velcro flap is great for getting stuff in and out quickly without having to use the front clip. In the front storage compartment, it can carry a bill fold and a few other odds and ends easily so I can leave my purse at home.Cons: Could use a bit more padding And I still have no idea what the back flap is for. I will probably be sewing a bottom to it so it can be a functional pocket.Overall, I would buy this type of bag again."
5,Best Camera Bag,"I've had this for over two years and it's still like new. No tears or stains which is uncommon in my household. It's very lightweight but protects my valuable camera and lenses remarkably well. Plus it has pouches galore for all your batteries, chargers, filters, SD cards and cleaning kit. And I still have room for more as I expand my camera gear collection. I did a lot of research before purchasing this bag and am quite pleased with it and I'm sure I will remain so for many years to come."
3,Too small,You can fit a few things in there but it's too cramped and bulks up the bag way too much. Should be a little roomier.
3,"Well-constructed bag, doesn't fit against body well","The bag is technically well-constructed -- solid and has good inserts and padding. However, it doesn't sit against my body like a messenger-style bag should. I bought a messenger bag so that the bag would fit against my body better than a trad'l style and more useful in crowds and while traveling. Unfortunately it looks like I'm going to have to shell out for a Crumpler to get the body-fit I'm looking for."
2,Great singer,"Great singer but audience way too loud between takes!! Amazon really penalizes you for returns also, be aware!!!!"
5,A Wonderful Album!,This by far is the best John Denver album I have ever heard. Go and pick it up! You'll love it!
1,4 stars for the 2 disk version - i should have looked at the track list before buying,"Shame on the music companies for putting out a one-disc version that was missing key songs (Today, Boy from the Country, and even more from the extended version) not available ANYWHERE ELSE. Get rid of some of the songs which are on every greatest hits, if you need room, for god's sake."
5,JOHN DENVER LIVES!!!,"With songs that could bring cheer to any who listens, John Denver created a legacy that will never be forgotten. This recording of live tracks is a must-own for any serious music collector. Grade: A+"
5,Soaring Eagle,"This album captures John near the pinnacle of his career. The quality of the quarter-century old recording is as good if not better than any modern live album. The recorded ""evening"" is laced with magic, love, laughter, peace and the inimitable artistry of the man at the age of about 27. Perfection is rare and seldom seen, heard or achieved, but here, John soars to the edge of heaven: the voice is rich, supple, soaring, controlled; the guitar is relaxed but complex and always in the right place. The balance and harmony between his voice, guitar and the audience is brilliant. His technical skills on the guitar when woven with his unique, beautiful voice enable him to reveal the depth of his spirit through the universal language of music, and the spirit lives here, on this recording."
5,lovely,"First bought the LP in 1975. A terrific bargain. Recently I got the CD. Still a classic but Today was tragically left out because of time restrictions. This version is better than the 1977 version in Sydney. Producers please, please release it in a future reissue. Listening to this concert is heavenly - a completely relaxing experience. John holds well with the original 1964 version by the New Christy Minstrels.Get this album without delay. completely"
5,my favorite j.d. album,"when i was growing up, john denver was the patron saint of my girl scout troup. his music taught us everything we needed to know about mother nature, our place in the universe, hopes and dreams, and caring about each other. how fortunate we are to still have him with us through his music. i usually hate live albums but i much prefer the song versions on this album to any other album of his. milt okun's orchestrations are fantastic, and john's inbetween-song narratives are priceless. my only regret is that they cut ""today"" and ""boy from the country"" from the cd (at least i still have them on vinyl!)."
5,Remembering John,"I met John Denver years ago while I was in the graphic arts business. His albums and music touched my heart everytime I heard him, and ""An Evening With John Denver"" is one of the most superior albums of his career. I never bought it on CD because of the exclusions of ""Today"" and ""Boy From The Country"" but now that they have been released to this CD, those are the reasons I bought it. I haven't heard the tracks on disc 2 yet, and as always, when ""live"" albums are compiled from various live sources, the mood does change. But I am anxious to hear this album again, and enjoy the warmth and love that John knew. I only met him once...but it's something I will never forget."
5,"Huge and soaring, 70s style","John Denver's soaring vocals capture a moment in time, a moment of strong belief and optimistic future. The first disc alone is worth the price. Very open, very intimate. Yes, sometimes the sentimentality pushes the boundaries, but he's such a welcoming guest that you're entranced into believing the bounties of life, the blessing of the bright morning sun, and feeling the hopefulness of a sweet song sung with the full force of his humanity."
5,One of JD's Best Recordings,"This, in my opninion, is one of Dever's best recordings. Many of his greatest songs are included here and most of all, you get to hear him interacting with his audience in a way that few performers are willing to do. Even in his speecj, he comes across as honest and sensitive. i have never considered myself a big Denver fan, but this album was really something else."
5,It is one of the best CD's ever!!!,"I attended the John Denver concent in Fort Worth as he took this particular album on the road. It was a delight. It opened up with the Starland Vocal Band. Remember them? This is quenessential John Denver at his best, and really preserves his memory and his love of music and the people that loved him."
5,john denver live as it was ment to be,this is the live alblum to top all live alblums it has all of his hits except sunshine on my sholders he was awesome in concert i never saw him but by listening to this cd you can tell he was great i mean what a tallent rocky mountin high sweet surender thank god im a country boy country roads and in my opinion one of the most romantic sonds ever recorded annies song there all here and never sounded better.
5,IT IS ONE OF MY BEST DVD's,"If you want to see Big fun,steppin'out,too hot,Oh lalala live this is the best Dvd with good quality and you fill like you are in that concert.i advice all that haven't bought this dvd to buy it."
2,Not so kool,"I ordered this disk in large part due to the other recommendations on amazon about this DVD . That said , this disk has very poor sound quality compared to my other DVD's . I can't say that the performances are bad , but the camera work is jerky and the sound quality is on par with regular TV. I would not recommend this DVD if sound quality is important to you."
2,looked like 1970,Video quality was old. looked like I was watching Don Cornelius. Was waiting for the bell bottom jeans to come out. I am sure other Kool videos are much better to watch.
5,"T.C. Boyle at his best, many times over!","The first book I read of Boyle's was Tortilla Curtain. I have been HOOKED ever since. I am not usually a fan of short stories, I tend to prefer novels for more at length character development and situations (blah blah blah). T.C. Boyle is amazing - you can get all of that in a ten page story! This is the best collection of short stories that I own and I re-read them many times over. I also bought two copies and gave them as gifts to friends whom have not read any Boyle. (And they were very impressed with the stories) You can't lose with this collection. His stories are full and rich with detail. They are great for bathtub reading, plane trips or when you don't have a lot of time. You can get an entire experience out of just a few pages and not feel cheated. The only other short stories I have enjoyed this much are those by Roald Dahl. So - that must say A LOT for T.C. Boyle!"
5,Hard-Boyled and Enduring,"I can't remember when I've enjoyed a collection of short stories any more. TC Boyle is an imaginative bottomless pit of intriguing short fiction ideas. At 691 pages, this collection is a comprehensive look into the mind of one of our most talented prose stylists. Boyle is, in fact, at his luinous best in the shorter work. While his novels become at times ponderous, the reader will not find that to be true in the shorts.There are way too many great stories to mention here, but a few highlights for me were ""Heart of a Champion,"" ""The Human Fly,"" The Ape Lady in Retirement,"" ""Mexico,"" and ""Bloodfall."" I've taught ""Greasy Lake"" for years to survey Lit classes who have typically found Boyle, if nothing else, to be provocative.Boyle's presence over the years in the highbrow New York magazines should solidify his place among American writers of his generation. It's nice to see the mass of this work in this well-organized very readable collection."
3,An OK book to recommend to your (jaded) friends,"The stories in the book run the gamut from boring and pointless (The Sinking House, Caye) to decent (The Ape Lady, Beat) to fairly entertaining (Little America, Green Hell). If you're into reading about negative, shallow, unlikeable people, this book is for you. This collection of stories is OK overall, but I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it."
1,misleading product description,This book was described as used good condition on Amazon.The book came with writing in a few places and lots of stamps from a local libraryOn inside of book.There was also a spot where the checkout card had been ripped from the inner cover.There was a plastic sheeting outer cover glued to the cloth hardback cover.The paper cover layer had stickers glued to it along with rips and tears.There was actually sand inside the outer plastic sleeve.The books level of damage was simply not indicated by the product description on Amazon.T.C. Boyle Stories
5,The BEST Collection Ever,"This collection includes ""The Big Garage"" and ""Filthy with Things,"" either of which is worth many times the retail price of the book. They are stories that stay with you longer than novels and feature length movies and symphonies. I can't say enough about this gem. You won't regret getting to know these 69 facets of T.C."
2,don't bother with this one.,"Dorothy Hamilton is very annoying, the video is should be about Thomas Keller, not her. The video repeats itself often. I love Thomas Keller and would love to see a video of him cooking in his restaurant."
5,Not just for women!,"An excellent book that would be helpful for men also. Practical advice given in a loving manner. Excellent ""real life"" examples to illustrate points."
1,Should have been a magazine article,"I don't usually review books, but felt compelled because this one was such a waste of time and I guess I'm sore about it. I'm not sure why I plodded through this interminable book; probably because I was hoping for some revelatory advice that would justify my investment. No such luck. In addition to being poorly edited (I caught a few errors), the book is poorly organized and sooooo repetitive. I easily could reduce the entirety of the plodding narrative to a magazine article very suitable for O! magazine: rely on good friendships and family relationships, take a hot bath, get a manicure or massage, eat well, get enough sleep, use cognitive reasoning, set healthy boundaries, do yoga, ask for help, take deep breaths to relax...this is news?"
5,Air for life,"The safety instructions given on every airline flight advise you to put on your own oxygen mask before attempting to help others with theirs. Similarly, the overriding message of Alice Domar's book is that you can only be of help to others once you have nurtured yourself. With real-life examples, cognitive restructuring techniques, mind/body exercises, writing assignments, and poignant insight, Alice provides inspiration and instruction for essential self care. Encompassing the realms of relationships, work, and play, Alice's book serves as a metaphorical oxygen mask for helping women breathe mindfully in all areas of their lives."
2,Common Sense,"It's hard to argue with much in this book, since it's mostly common sense. This is basically a self-help book with four different programs (for each of the four seasons). The ideas are drawn from a number of contemporary sources (e.g., The Relaxation Response) and presented in engaging, but repetitive manner."
2,another woman's comfort book,I like Domar's book but it's just not very fresh. The Woman's Comfort Book by Jennifer Louden and other books proclaimed this same message years ago - and with more style and detail. But I do love hearing it from Harvard!
4,Attitude is everything,"It may be obvious that attitude is the key to controlling stress, but like another book that covers this idea, TRAVEL WITH OTHERS WITHOUT WISHING THEY'D STAYED HOME, it's helpful to be reminded that we can control our attitudes."
4,Many mornings after the 60s,"The White Album was published in 1979, and most of the material here is from the 1970s. Even so, the book is at least as much about the 1960s as is Slouching Towards Bethlehem. Like that book, this is a collection of essays from various publications, plus some previously unpublished material. It's a mixed bag. The title piece is quite strong, as is ""On The Morning After The Sixties,"" proving, perhaps, that the 1960s really were Didion's one true subject. There's other good stuff here, too, and the book is actually sort of underrated, since so many observers rate it a poor second to Slouching Towards Bethlehem. But the Didion style is actually quite strong in this volume, sharply observed, carefully written, personal without being confessional, and always flirting with detachment but not quite achieving it. Obviously some people just can't stand Didion's essays, and this book would hardly change their mind; but if you're open to her style, this is worth reading."
5,A Guide Through the Sixties,"Didion is a master of prose and arresting journalism. Like Norman Mailer's Armies of the Night, she places herself within the action, identifying her place in historical events. She recounts the 60s, and its epicenter, California (especially Los Angeles), with precise lucidity--Didion was there, and DOES remember the 60s. Some of the most intruiging essays are those that serve as memoirs for her time and place--waiting with the Doors for Jim Morrison to show up for a recording session, travelling through Bogota, exploring California's water systems. Required reading for Angelenos."
4,People and places of the 60s and 70s,"Joan Didion's essays are sharply observed and very personal. She informs us of her fragile mental state in the very first essay, in which she describes a pervasive sense of detachment that she felt from the world. She then goes on to deliver a collection of well-written profiles on personalities, places, and the concerns of the time (late 60s-early 70s). Didion inserts herself and her personal issues into these pieces on ocassion, which no doubt contributes to the accusation by some that she is a whiner. On the contrary, I feel that it was courageous for Didion to reveal herself this way and that the awareness of the narrator as a fragile, flawed individual rather than an omnipotent, god-like commentator pronouncing judgement on its subjects gives a unity and a perspective to these disparate pieces that they would not have possessed otherwise."
5,Intelligent writing on the interesting sixties and seventies,"I feel very fortunate to have been turned on to this book and, more importantly, this writer! Many of the stories told have the feel of someone sitting on the edge of the scene, looking in on many of the interesting people and events of the late 1960s and into the 70s. It's a fun perspective. After reading lots of sixties memoir-type writings, I'd say this is a unique one. These essays seem to be covering topics she'd previously written on as a journalist.. so they're memoirs, in a way. With some familiar characters -- Jim Morrison, Eldridge Cleaver, Nancy Reagan, etc. -- and others I'm just coming to learn about, new and uncommon scenes are played out. In other words, they're mostly stories I haven't read yet from a subject that's maybe overly covered. It's a quick read, but an entertaining one from someone who knew how to describe her surroundings during an interesting time. I will now go looking for more Joan Didion books..."
5,contemporary culture from a Didion's-eye-view...,"....her fine prose unpeels the life in So. California and exposes it to us in all its marvelous and wannabe glamor. Her critique of ""The Women's Movement""--that (in my terms) the victim-thinking, entitlement, and pie-in-the-sky idealism of some of its staunchest party-liners reveal more about the damage done by the patriarchy than the propaganda does--remains relevant, unfortunately."
4,World-class essayist,"4.5 starsI read this when it first came out; it opened my 13-year old eyes to many things. One that has stayed with me is that Didion isn't constantly writing as a ""Woman"" (as many women in the 60s and 70s did). She writes as a person and a thinker. She has a distinctly female viewpoint, but doesn't hit the reader over the head with it like a weapon. She lulls and then challenges you with her intelligence and perspective. For a typical male such as I it was a nice awakening.My Dad loved Didion and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, and read every word they wrote as soon as it was published. I was damn lucky to grow up in a house full of great books by great thinkers.This is a fine companion to Slouching Towards Bethlehem; if you don't know Didion's writing, it's time to get familiar with her."
1,Insipid and ridiculous,"I can't remember what I did with my copy of this book. I either gave it to a friend or threw it in the garbage. Didion is a whiner - she comes across as the poor little rich girl, complaining about being in the studio when Paul McCartney recorded Why don't we do it in the road. Sorry Joan, I wish you could have been there when the Beatles recorded Ob la di, ob la da if the other track wasn't significant enough! Her other noteworthy tidbit is being in the recording studio with the Doors when Jim Morrison showed up late and either too high or too mental to record. Joan should know that life is full of disappointments. However, I know lots of people who would have felt it was exciting to see Morrison in person, even at his crazy worst. If you're looking to revel in the pseudo heartbreaks of a neurot, I recommend this book."
2,BEWARE: Colors May Vary,"They aren't kidding about he colors may vary disclaimer. I thought that would mean that I may not get the purple/orange pair, but I was hoping the colors would still be gender neutral. Not so. I have two boys and ended up with a pink and purple pair. The swimmies ARE great - I bought a pair a few years ago on vacation for my older son and they have held up really well. That's why I wanted to get a pair for my one-year-old. I called to try to get a different color and was told that was basically impossible. So, if you really don't care what color you get I would recommend the swimmies."
3,Pink and Purple,"I usually disregard the ""colors may vary"" when buying toys, but in this case I should have heeded the warning. I have a toddler boy and while I don't mind some pink, these were bright pink and purple. Too over the top for a boy. Disappointing -- giving them away to friends and don't want to risk buying another pair."
5,Great Value,"I was looking for an inexpensive battery for my cordless phone. After having good results with a battery that was purchased for a family member, I decided to try one myself when my battery was nearing the end of it's useful life. The battery that I was replacing was a 400mah so I was skeptical of this battery which was listed as only 350mah. To my surprise, the battery that I actually received is a 600mah. I have absolutely no complaints with this product BUT, I've only been using it for a little over a month now. I will update this review after a few more months. Bottom line, DON'T pay ridiculously high prices at the electronics or big box stores when looking for any type of specialty battery. Just search the web and chances are, you'll find yourself on the Amazon.com site."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"It's a pretty good movie, but what happened with the dog at the end made absolutely no sense. How did the producer guy know the dog was in the asylum is the main question, it's just not explained at all. The main plot of the movie was good, but it's just jerky to introduce a subplot, get the viewer invested in where it's going, and then offer no comprehensible conclusion."
4,T.A,I love to sew and i teach and this book is great for a beinger who wants to sew and start sewing right away the instructions are easy and i love it i couldnt get the book at hsn because it sold out and i found it here for a better price thanks must buy !! for home projects its for any crafter who needs some easy and fun ideas thanks
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"If there were a choice below 1 star, that would be my rating for this movie. I bought at Walmart -- this and another movie bundled for $5.98. I should have known by the price, that it couldn't be much of a movie. Horribly depressing, terrible storyline. I almost stopped watching half-way through, but kept thinking something may happen to redeem this movie. I was wrong! Don't even want to donate this movie to church rummage sale. Believe I will just throw it away!"
4,Good solution to keep water fresh,"I'm using this solution for a while, to keep water in our RV water tank fresh, and it works pretty well for me.Usually I keep water in the water tank in the RV, both as a convenience (always ready to go for an RV trip), and as a security measure (always have 60 gallons of water handy in case of an emergecy), and it is important to prevent the water from going bad. This solution proved to be pretty good for it - it keeps water fresh, and it does not create any smell (so you don't have clorine smell in your water). Usually I will use the water in the tank in 3-4 month so don't know whether it will really work for 5 years as claimed, but for 3-6 month it proved to work pretty well.I wish the solution to be a bit cheaper, but even with the current price you get good value for the money."
4,Great Product but...,"I love that this product permits long term emergency water storage of 5 years (as opposed to 6-12 months for bleach treated water).The idea of having to dump, refill & retreat large amounts that frequently is daunting at best, not to mention the hassle of hauling it all out of,& back into,its storage spots.To me this does make it worth the price, which admittedly seems pretty high for such a tiny bottle.However I was rather disappointed that when it arrived a significant amount had leaked out into the plastic bag (saturating the instruction pamphlet)even though the ""collar"" seal around the cap was intact.(This same problem was also posted by another reviewer who had this issue with 2 out of 3 orders.)"
3,"OK, but short on expiration time",The water preserver was very easy to use. Add the amount of drops you need for the amount of water you want to preserve. It gives the water treated a 5-year expiration. The only thing that bugged me is that it has it's own expiration date and that was only 13-months from when I received the product. Huh??!!??
1,duh me,"If you want to pay $14 for 3/4 of an ounce of 5% sodium hypochlorite and 95% water, be my guest. The 5% 'active' ingredient, sodium hypochlorite, is common bleach. I didn't know that until I used it and smelled what was obviously bleach. This stuff is an incredible rip off."
1,broken again,"This is the second time I placed an order this product.In both cases the product came leaking inside its plastic bag.Cap was broken on bottle.So far 3 bottles total ordered, and 2 bottles were leaking!!!"
4,Great Historically Based Novel,"I found the book to be extremely interesting and easy to read. Not having much background on the founding of Harvard, I learned a lot of the history of the school, its founding fathers and how the traditions of Harvard came to be. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the history of your great nation, the interesting people who founded it and Harvard University."
4,Novel of Epic Proportions,"This is a fascinating and an enlightening book about Harvard University, a lost play of Shakespeare, and John Harvard, for whom the college is named after due to his enormous contribution of books. The story begins in the 1600's and traces the Wedge family, the descendant family that the Shakespeare play is entrusted to. The book moves back and forth between present and past. Peter Fallon, Bostonian antique book dealer is trying to locate the play on behalf of the present-day Wedge family. The search becomes dangerous when it is evident that someone will even murder to get the play. Fascinating and educational!"
2,An unexpected disappointment,"This is the first book of William Martin's that I have read, and it made me want to take back the others I have already purchased! I do applaud the originality of the premise of the book, but while the historical component is interesting (though underdeveloped at the expense of trite and silly dialogue), the fiction component leaves a lot to be desired. While this could have been a much more engaging and sophisticated work, it seems that Martin allowed this book to drop off to the level of a ""beach read."" My expectations of this writer were clearly not met as I would expect much loftier output from a Harvard graduate."
5,HARVARD YARD,"With the death of James Michener, a great void was left in the world of historical novels. William Martin has filled that void with GREAT historical novels about New England and other times and places in history. HARVARD YARD brings you face to face with the history of America's oldest college and the persons who played a major role in its development. All this comes about as a mystery unfolds in the same manner as the movie ""National Treasure"". Excitement from page 1-the end. Step back and live history from 1600 to the present."
2,did i read the same book as the rest of you???,"i wanted to love Harvard Yard as much as Back Bay and Cape Cod (2 of Martin's earlier books) but something about it fell terribly flat. Although similar in its blend of past history with present day mystery, in 'Yard, too much time was spent developing the historical characters to the detriment of the central plot. at times i found myself counting pages and wondering when I'd get back to the real story!another complaint i have is sloppy editting. too much repetition; ""a man is known by his books"" was quoted at least a thousand times...and the inability to do simple computation: Fallon's age wasn't figured correctly for the time period in which the story took place. although some might find these minor points, errors like that color my opinion of the finished product.overall, Harvard Yard was too long, only mildly interesting, and not cohesive enough for me to recommend."
2,Save me from this dialogue!,"I wanted to like this book. I love historical fiction and mysteries. But finally, after just a few chapters, I had to stop. The Puritan-era English dialogue Martin writes is just junk--he actually just uses non-conjugated ""be"" over and over to indicate Early Modern English, and that's just laziness. Speakers of English did not suddenly begin saying ""I am"" instead of ""I be"" only in the last few hundred years. It's not even necessary to indicate period language, but if you're going to do it, why not make it at least slightly accurate.When a wealthy noblewoman said ""I be impressed,"" I'd had enough. I threw the book in the trash. Not only do I refuse to read it, I don't want anyone else to do so, either."
5,Great book.,"It was both exciting and provided an excellent review of the history of Harvard. I am a Harvard graduate, but I still learned a lot."
4,Terrific!,"This is a really fun romp through the history of Harvard, which, as it turns out, is quite inextricable from the history of this continent. Martin manages to combine a truly original premise, an intriguing quest narrative, and a modern detective story into a single well-paced book. If you've ever been through Boston, or gazed at the ivy-covered brick of Harvard Yard, you'll really enjoy this book."
1,Harvard Yawn,"An atrocious historical novel about the history of Harvard and the fictional (I hope) Wedge family, who infest the venerable school like termites in the woodwork. From the 17th century through the 20th, the generations of Wedges parading through the Yard look and sound as if they're all the same tedious, self-satisfied bore, simply moved from one century into the next. The other characters -- and the thin bibliomystery that holds the thing together -- are almost as mind-numbing. At times I suspected that Martin fell asleep while he was writing it. Yalies everywhere must be giggling."
1,Headphones' rubber gripper disintegrates,There is one thing that I have not seen mentioned here that will make it very difficult to use these headphones -- the rubber gripper that holds the headphones on your head (without them slipping down) disintegrates over time.I have not had my Jensen JW160 headphones that long but that gripper has already broken into several pieces. So now when I put them on my head they just slide down. The earpieces are then down around my neck.I don't know whether this is a problem with all headphones but it is definitely something to consider when buying these headphones.
4,Pretty Decent with TV,"Not sure about range - I go outside with them but can't go real far. Receiver is sitting on the tv. I've had them for some time. Only complaint I have is that the AAA Rechargeable batteries I have won't work in them. I haven't tried lithium batteries, but I plan to. For the price, they do a pretty good job."
1,One of the Worst Electronic Purchases I have Ever made!!,"These are not anywhere near worth the money! I suppose anyone deeply committed to the idea of wireless headphones ought to spring for pricier models, but this shabby excuse for a set of headphones has put me off the idea altogether. I'll stick to limited mobility for clear sound for now. The static is terrible, I can't hear a thing...so sue me for having a cordless phone! I'm embarassed I ever bought these....don't bother! I'd give it NO STARS if I could."
2,Constant Adjestment,"TV sound is OK, but static requires almost constant tuning of earphones. I usually used the earphones within 10 feet of the transmitter, but still got a lot of static unless perfectly tuned."
1,Poor performance,"The only use I have found for these headphones is to use them directly in front of the TV. Even then the sound is extremely poor. Any sharp noises like clapping or drums comes out as static. I have to fiddle with the tuning constantly to keep the static down, and that's without moving around. If you position yourself just right, have the tuning just right, they are almost usable. Don't even think about using these for music as that experince would be painful with these headphones. I also cannot use these in most parts of the house as they tend to pick up noise from Fluorescent lights and cordless telephones quite easily. Do not waste your money on these, as they are not worth it even if they were free."
3,"Sound is fine, but not designed for prolonged use","I wear these at work for hours at a time -- the sound quality is just fine and the open air concept is great, so long as your office mate doesn't mind some noise pollution. My only gripe is with the headphone design: it's rather cheap and doesn't have many adjustable pieces. The strap material that sits over your head is a sponge-like foam that feels itchy at best and the adjusting mechanism doesn't offer much range. Also, if you wear prescription glasses, you'll likely find that, given the lack of adjustable piecies, your ears are more susceptible to discomfort. Bottom line: good sound quality for the price, but not very comfortable for extended periods of time."
1,Blew-em out with Classic Punk,"These were fine for a short while. When cranked with Dead Boys, Johnny Thunders, Floyd or whatever they frazzeled and are now in the garbage can."
1,Unbelievable Hissing,"I don't claim to know much about elctronics, but I do expect not to feel as though I have a cobra wrapped around my head hissing in my ear. It's enough to drive you insane and would not adjust out. The stated operating range of up to 150` is a bit exaggerated also. Some static within just a few feet. This product did not meet my expectations when purchased at around $60, their MAYBE worth about $20. Their going back."
1,POOR quality,"I purchased this too because of the pricing. I have never been this dissapointed with a tech product in my life. You cannot move more than 10 feet without static and interferece, I would like to meet the idividual who tested this product at 150 feet becuse it more like 1.5 feet if you want any type of reception or sound quality. At any rate I did return this product as a very unsatisfied customer. This was the first and last product I purchase from the Jensen corp. Save your self the frustration and head aches (literally) and spend the money and get yourself and higher quality product. Also... Read a review or two before purchsing, I wish I had."
1,Spend more and get the best.,I bought this primarily beacuse of the price- I regret ever buying it. It is a very poor quality item. Lot of static even when using 5-6 ft. from the transmitter. I have caught phone conversations on the headphones. Would not recommend.
5,Love this cologne,I have been purchasing this scent for about 6 years now. My husband loves it and so do I. I went into the dept store one year at Christmas and was looking for a scent for my husband to wear. I went thru everything in the counters and was about to give up when the sales lady came up and asked if she could help me. I stated what I was looking for. She then said she knew exactly what I was looking and pulled this from behind the counter. I feel in love with it as did my daughter. This is definently a scent you only share with that special someone.
5,Smells great!,"I could not find this anywhere in the stores, and of course Amazon came through again and had a great price. The shipment came very fast, just in time for Christmas!"
4,Great price. Great Cologne.,Product arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted. It smells great and a better price than a department store.
3,clean scent,"Not my favorite - I don't enjoy the lingering scent of cardamom in the dry down, but overall a clean fragrance, good on most guys."
3,Not as Good as the Female Version,"I have the female version of Hei. This fragrance just doesn't have the fineness that I expected and read in the reviews. Hei, on me, smelled cheap and heavy. It also has lingering power because even after I showered, trying to rid the scent, I could still smell it.What we have to keep in mind are the chemical effects. Tresor lasts and lasts on my skin, so does White Linen, but Romance by Lauren does not. Shi has staying power on me, and so (unfortunately) does Hei, but I don't like the what it reacted with my chemistry. I smelled cheap, which is pointless in the beauty of fragrance."
1,Not Worth It-Water Down!,"I Loved the price, but remember the old saying ""if it's too good to be true, it probably is"". When you spray the colonge you can tell right away it's watered down, after 10 mins of applying fragrance the scent disappears.People save your money and buy it from a department store. I was going to buy another colonge from these guys but I'm glad I waited and will never purchase another perfume/colonge from here again!!"
4,"Good, but i've seen better","I've seen those [other] sports radio headphones, but i didn't have [$], so i bought these because these are cheap. First the pros: These sound awesome, they don't mess up bass. You can make them quiet or loud. Now the cons: These are uncomfortable over time, but this is only after like an hour of nonstop listening. A minor one, but the foam covers sometimes slip off over time. You can easily slip them back on though. My verdict;I dunno if i'll save money for the [other] of buy these again."
3,DELIVERS WHAT YOU EXPECT,"WHILE NOBODY IN THIS MOVIE WILL EVER WIN AN OSCAR IT DELIVERS WHAT YOU EXPECT IN A WOMEN'S PRISON MOVIE PLENTY OF ATTRACTIVE WOMEN WHO END UP NUDE AT LEAST PART OF THE TIME, AND THE STORY IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THE UNDERCOVER COP AND THE TROUBLE SHE GETS IN, BUT WILL YOU MOST LIKELY BUY THIS DVD TO SEE ABUNDANT FEMALE NUDITY AND IT CERTAINLY DELIVERS THAT"
4,Under Lock and Key,This was a good prison movie and liked the actors and actresses and love women's prison movies very much also
4,Under Lock and Key,This is an old movie about women prison. Its story is in the general stream: The prison management in the eyes of inmatesand federal agents. Nude scenes are limited and not porn. Take it as an investigation case with little twists. Just watch itand have fun.
4,women nude,Will it is a good movie to watch if you love women nude in shower but no hypnosis in this movie that I would like to see.

1,"Too ""dancy"" and complicated; not very intense aerobically","I didn't like this kickboxing video.It seemed more like ""kickdancing"".I have done the Kathy Smith kickboxing video, and prefer it by far to this one. This has a practically non-existant warm up, and no instruction on technique (proper body stance, pivoting on foot when cross-punching, difference between side kicks and roundhouse kicks, etc.) It seems more of a workout for a dancer pretending to kickbox.The complicated moves don't even make it as aerobically intense as it should be.The cueing of which foot to use or which move comes next is truly horrible.(Even some exercisers on the video can't follow the moves!)Pass up this one!"
3,Uneven workout,"I enjoy this workout, but I can see problems with it. There isn't much of a warm up or cool down. There are three different cardio sections and an ab section. There is no cool down for the cardio sections, so you go from a high heartrate and then it starts another section with tai chi. There are also times that Tracey is off or does the wrong move and it could be confusing.Besides that, I really like the moves and it gets my heartrate up, I can get over the other things and warm up/cool down on my own."
2,A little softer than most,"This video does get your heart pumping and makes you sweat, however,it's not really about jabbing and kicking but more about satisfying your ""inner being"" and suppressing ""negative energy"". The live percussion band made it harder for me to get involved, I prefer cheesy workout music any day. I was expecting a more hard-core kickboxing workout, but this was more of a yoga/tai chi video. I would recommend Kathy Smith's kickboxing video if you want a serious workout."
2,Give me a break!,"I am sorry, but this was one of the WORST workout videos I have ever tried!Lets forget the fact that there is basically NO warm-up. The instructor is beyond annoying and the only thing I felt that was anywhere NEAR worthwhile on the tape was the abs workout. A return ...for me..."
3,Good to Start Out With,"I bought this video before ever trying kickboxing at a gym. This is a great video to start out with. I still use it as a filler workout on the days I don't do the NordicTrack followed by free weights or go to the gym. The video is pretty easy to follow. The drums are different, but the beat is good and you do get used to them. Tracey motivates you to keep going. I don't feel as if I am getting a great workout now and I am looking for a more advanced video, perhaps one with some bag work included.I would recommend this video to someone who is just starting out."
5,What a GREAT VIDEO! Great alternative to Tae Bo!,"This video is fantastic for die hard Tae Bo fanatics. It really gets the heart pumping and Tracey Mallett can really help guide you. For Beginner's it might be a bit too much as she has alot of balancing techniques at the beginning of the tape which might prove difficult to beginners. All in all, a great workout!"
2,packaging,"When I ordered this item I wanted the PNY item including the packaging as it is shown with the product images. Instead, I got just a memory module in just a plastic bag."
3,PNY memory,"The PNY memory is probably as good as most.My complaint is when something goes wrong. I had one memory module out of 4 go bad after 4 years in service. PNY makes it very difficult to make use of their ""Lifetime"" warranty.On the other hand I've had good warranty experiences with Kingston and Crucial.""Lifetime"" warranties should not require so much proof of ownership and original packaging and UPC codes and then need to be ""checked"" when the part is sent in to confirm complaint and tracking / insurance on return package and the list goes on.A couple of those things would be considered normal but all together it is just a matter of PNY trying to keep from honoring their ""Lifetime"" warranty by wearing you down.End of rant and end of my purchasing PNY memory."
2,Made in Taiwan,"This is my second set. These do not last long. Made in Taiwan, like with everything else in the America."
3,LEFT ME WITH MANY QUESTIONS,"TOM & VIV WAS AN ENTERTAINING MOVIE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POET T.S. ELIOT AND HIS CRAZY WIFE VIVIENNE HAIGH-WOOD. AT NO POINT DID I DEVELOP A BOND WITH EITHER CHARACTER. I WISHED I COULD HAVE ROOTED FOR ONE OF THEM...EITHER FOR ELIOT TO RID HER AND SEE HIS CAREER FLOURISH OR FOR HER TO FIND HEALTH AND HAPPINESS. THE END OF THE MOVIE LEFT ME WITH MANY QUESTIONS INCLUDING ""DID T.S. ATTEND HER FUNERAL?"""
4,Learn to hate TSE,"I'm sure Eliot scholars would have a lot to say about the film, but I'm one of those readers of Eliot who has just grown weary of his heavy handedness. So this film spoke to me--Eliot is shown to be overbearing, manipulative, and one unfeeling mofo. Good enough for me."
4,General Help,"Overall, the book is helpful. It starts off discussing the general pavement types, design methods, and roads tests. Included in this section are the results of findings which, although not something I consider in everyday design, are items that are interesting enough to promote thought in my designs. All in all, I found almost all the chapters useful as they cover stresses in flexible and rigid pavements, rigid and flexible pavement design, drainage design, pavement performance, as well as a few other issues.The only downfall are the two chapters covering the authors computer program. Most books have this problem, though, as technology quickly outgrows software, but enough information is given in relation to results of parametric studies to make these chapters worth the time needed to read through them.All in all, a pretty good purchase."
2,disappointing,"A very sad DVD, with, surprisingly, extremely bad acting of almost everybody in the three scenes on this DVD. People seem to be glued to the spot, endless shots watching a lifeless actress wobbling towards the camera, well, one needs a lot of patience to sit this one out.The two stars are for the trouble of making this film with,I suspect,a VERY low budget."
3,"works, but-----",the plug was wrong. had to cut it off and wire the original plug on.but after that everything fit ok and the fan works.My granddaughter now travels back and forth to school in a warm vehicle.
1,no way to navigate this massive work,"Navigating this entire work for notes on a particular book or section of the Bible is nearly impossible since there are no navigational aids or table of contents. The formatting is also non-existent. The only way to access the content of this book is to read it from the beginning to the end. That would be fine for some books but not for a reference work on the Bible.It is highly unlikely that the creator of this content tested this on a Kindle device or tried to use it themselves on this device. A complete waste of money which I'm going to attempt to recoup from the company. I also purchased another ""Kindle"" book from this same company (GraceWorks) and it suffers from the same problem.I hate to bash a company - especially one putting out such a valuable resource but the product is so unusable that I can't recommend this in good conscience to anyone else."
1,March 2011 Still no table of contents,"Don't believe the reviewer that says this is easy to jump to a specific book or chapter. I wish that were true. I believed that bogus review and bought it but much to my disappointment it is quite difficult to find a desired book muchless chapter. Searching won't get you there and honestly I dont know why. Searching for Zechariah 13 should get me there but no luck. While this is a great reference work, it is not quite ready to be called the kindle edition. Please update this work. And please no more fake reviews. Remember this a text based on scripture..."
1,Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible,"I must admit that I'm new at using my Kindle, but I also must admit that this is the worst book to navigate around in. I'm not even able to get out of the TOC to be able to read the commentary or get into any other book.I would not recommend this book to anyone using a Kindle, not until they fix this product! It's not worth spending the money on this item.I will not purchase any more books from Grace Works, if this is the way they sell their product."
3,Works as avertised!!,"I'm not used to the ""jittery movements""of a camera running through a router,as compared to my hard wired system,so I have to say the unit works well,and the features are outstanding."
2,Ok when working,"Pros:- Great image quality- no that hard to setupCons:- There is some sort of a problem with the camera built-in software, after accessing it remotley, it hangs and it needs to be restarted (by POWERING it OFF - ON ) this is very inconvenient where as the main purpose of getting this camera is to monitor home remotley."
2,"Challenging setup, 25% Audio","I have multiple routers in my apartment. Took my loooong time to figure out that both my main desktop PC and the camera must be connected to the router facing the incoming Internet connection. All other mixed connections did not work. And the router must support UPnP...The image quality is decent.Sound quality is very good, but only when I get the sound to work, which is less than 25% of the time. Extremely annoying and no help from Panasonic. That is why only 2 stars."
1,Disappointed ***AMENDED**- please read,"I bought this camera for one reason only; to allow my family back home in Canada to view my wedding here in Texas. After setting it up and testing it a few days before, I was a little worried because it froze up quite often. Sure enough, when the big moment rolled around, the camera locked up and my family was unable to view the wedding. Thanks, Panasonic. $160 down the drain.**************************** AMENDED ***********************************Ok, not so disappointed now... I feel compelled to amend my previous review/comment about this camera and apologize to Panasonic. After some more research into my problem, I discovered the fault was not with the camera but with my Linksys wireless router. I have since purchased another router and the camera works perfectly. It has been running for many days straight and I have no problems to report."
1,"Help, I can't view my camera romotely","I have tried setting up this camera for a week now. When I'm at home on my laptop it works perfectly, and I can see and hear everything. When I tried to get the camera setup where I can access it remotely, I keep getting an error message saying that setup has failed, and that I need to enable UPnP settings.I have internet and a wireless modem through Verizon Fios. I accessed my Fios modem and enabled UPnP settings, and reset the Panasonic camera. I still have not had any success setting up remote access for this device. I don't think it should be this difficult, and I'm guessing it's something with my modem, but I am not sure there is a way to fix it. Please let me know if you have any suggestions, I would really appreciate it. Thanks for reading."
2,"Locks Up Every Day, But Would Have Been Great Otherwise","I bought this camera to remotely check in on a property when no one is there. The features are great--other reviews cover them in detail, but the camera has a critical flaw that has also been mentioned many times in other reviews: it locks up every 24 hours or so and becomes unreachable over the Internet. It must be manually power-cycled before it will work again.I am really disappointed in Panasonic for releasing this product with such a serious flaw that goes to the heart of the product's functionality. What good is an Internet camera if it constantly locks up and has to be reset in person before it will work?I wish I could get my money back for this one. If a major product like a car was designed this poorly, regulators would be all over it. Somehow Panasonic got away with releasing this one."
2,Recording Software is Buggy,"I wish Panasonic would allow you to update their software so that it wouldn't keep crashing every 4 hours. For some reason the recording software just dies and you have to reboot to get everything working again. When you look at the ""About"" page, they don't have any way to get the software patches to the consumer.Does anyone know of other software that would work with this camera?"
2,Locks up ALL THE TIME,"Only buy this camera as a toy. It locks up every day and has to be powered cycled. I have no client software running, nothing. It just locks up by itself. Even with the latest firmware applied. As of 07/21/09 the problem still not resolved and Panasonic has no answers. They just have a flawed firmware on this one and is going to be a door stop soon. When I do have the chance on seeing it work, it is not too bad. No where near 30fps. This is what Panasonic did. They took a cheap color camera and stuck it in a fairly cool and useful housing that moves and has a bugged firmware. I'm very surprised they are still selling this one since after it locks up you can't use it. I would imagine most people returned theirs."
1,Disappointed,Purchased three of these cameras. So far no luck getting them operational even with several calls to Panasonic Tech support and Lynksis. Not Plug & Play-at all. Still may get them going with paid help from computer person.
1,No cable included,"Be aware that you need an LAN cable to connect this thing to your router.And there's no LAN cable included -- which for a $150 item is pretty chintzy. I hate companies that pull that.Unfortunately I can't rate the actual performance of the product, because it's 11 o'clock at night, and I'm setting it up now, and it didn't come with a cable."
2,"Range not so good, performance worse",I purchased 4 of these and set them up around the house. The refresh rates when all 4 were running were very poor... like it would update every 5 seconds. If the range is increased.. it gets even slower. I had to return all of them (they were part of a kit).The more expensive 131A works great.. They must have better technology in that one. Of course it is much more expensive also.
2,Support is limited and online set up nearly impossible!,Brought this from schnoop and the camera works great on network. Wired and impossible to use a Mac with... now I'm looking for wireless and universal OS.
2,"Crashes often, requires constant reboot","The product works well when it works, it's very neat to be able to control where the camera is pointing. But requires a reboot about every two days.Even with the latest firmware, this device doesn't support https. Where are the other, no pan and tilt model BL-C101A supports https."
4,Best value for money ip-cam,"Bought the ip-cam to check out our nanny. I've searched for many other alternatives but at last I've got my first ip-cam as panasonic. I think they've done a great job. For this price - of best quality ""webcams"" - I've got a quite intelligent watch over from internet.*it is not still - you can watch all over the room*set up was very easy*voice quality is perfect*video quality could be better (VGA resolution is not perfect)but definetely a good value for money."
4,Great camera-challenging setup,"Once it is set up, this camera works very well. The Panasonic support folks were friendly and helpful. After two phone calls I was still not able to connect to the internet site. During the third call the tech discovered the internet site was down (for the first time in 5 years).For the money, this camera can't be beat. The picture is a bit grainy, but more than adequate for most security applications. The sound quality is excellent. The cameras pan and tilt functions are easily managed via the internet. I plan to add more cameras to the system in the future-probably wireless next time."
3,Camera Longevity,"I received the BL-C111 camera for Christmas in 2007 to add to my weather website. 2 weeks before Christmas 2009 the camera stopped working. Getting with tech support, I was informed the camera need to be sent back and repaired. The cost for them to just look at it was $100. They would then quota a repair cost. I have a big issue with the assessment charge. If they think their products are worthy, they should have a minimal cost to check it and not nearly the entire cost of a new camera.The camera is OK as far as image goes, slightly washed out in color as are most other low cost net cams. Fair for the price but I expected more than 2 years use out of it.I will most likely throw it in the trash and buy a non-Panasonic camera for a replacement."
5,Good internet camera for the price,"The biggest drawback of this product is the setup. If you just want to hook it up and see the video from your home network, it's a cinch. But to configure it for viewing through DDNS, recording, and email alerts took a bit more patience. But once it was all worked out, the camera out performed my expectations. I am now able to view and operate the camera from my cell phone and web browser. Video quality is decent but declines in dim light."
2,NOT MUCH COMPRESSION,These are nice shorts but I wouldnt call them compression.I was looking for something tight to wear under shorts to helpwith a torn quad and IT band problems. No support/compressionwith these. Nice running short perhaps but not what I was looking for.Sent them back.
5,Compression shorts,"I love them, they are perfect for wearing under fight shorts. Under Armour is a great product, very well made."
3,Are they Really Compressing?,"I think people who love these shorts either bought them one size small or have a brand loyal thing going. As I've been running longer distances lately, I decided to treat myself to two pair of leg-saving compression shorts. I bought these as well as a pair of McDavids women's compression shorts the same week. Comparing the two, the McDavids kick butt over these as far as comfort and compression. However the downside of the McDavid's is that they are NOT opaque enough to wear solo without attracting an unsavory crowd of fans. These in comparison to McDavids were $10 more, and very loose - aka my butt still jiggled more than I desired. They also don't have a crotch panel, and I found I was constantly adjusting myself during my run. The good news is these are plenty opaque so you can wear them without anything else on top. But if you really want to compress your ""junk in your trunk"", I'd recommend the McDavids over these. Or maybe just buy one of each as I did."
3,My son has STILL not received his copy.,"I'm enjoying my copy, but my son has still not received his copy. It would sure be nice if someone paid attention to this."
4,A worthy sequel,"In the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, the emerging capitalists are quietly destroying all political opposition. A highly placed government official arranges for Snowblood (Meiko Kaji) to be rescued from prison in order to assassinate an important anarchist writer. The plan backfires, resulting in the inevitable bloodbath. The solid grounding in Japanese historical events adds interest to this low-budget actioner, but Kaji should have been given more to do. For much of the film, she is a bystander, soaking up the injustice of the events she witnesses until she becomes the embodiment of vengeance. I do not share the opinion of the other reviewers who feel this film is less violent than the first. There was quite enough swoprdplay and bloodshed to satisfy me."
3,"Passable, but not as strong as the original","The original Lady Snowblood was a slightly campy tale of violence and vengeance. Perhaps it wasn't intended to be so funny, but that's what happens when you go so far over the top. This sequel toned down the violence and invincibility of Yuki Snowblood, and added some morality with the backdrop of a fight between Japan's anarchists and emerging capitalists.Unfortunately, the added morality does not do much for the movie. Taking a level off the violence leaves us with a mediocre action movie, and the end product is not worthy of the cult classic status granted the original."
1,"Rare Tracks, but Muffled Sound","One might want this for the few rare tracks; but the noise reduction is greatly overdone, and muffled sound is the result. The beauty of Florence's voice is impossible to appreciate through this cd. With recordings this early, one must be willing to accept a great deal of white noise in order to hear all of the frequencies that were present in the original recording. In regard to her early recordings, only when listening to a recording to which no noise reduction has been applied may one hear the beautiful tones of Florence's voice, and fully appreciate her artistry."
1,i think you might get sea sick,"i must say, the quality of the picture is awful. The picture wavers, like on the movie channals that you don't recive. The picture ""wavers"" about every 10 seconds, like a wave on the beach. It's so agrivating to watch TV on this thing. A must-not buy. terrible sound, too--i am not exagerating. On some shows, it almost sounds like your listening to the broadcasts from outer pace. The sound accually wavers. on some moments, it's almost decent, and at some, it's really bad. what a waste"
3,"It's not ""Gigi"" but it tries to be entertaining","With an outstanding cast of singers (Frank Sinatra) and dancers (Shirley Maclaine and Juliet Prowse) plus cast-members from ""Gigi"" (Maurice Chevaler and Louis Jordan) ""Can-Can"" should be better. But the sets look fake (they are) and the Adam and Eve ballet makes no sense... However, it does have its moments. Most of the dance numbers are quite good, and it can still be considered a classic musical. (""Gigi is much better, and most of it's French locations are real.) ***1/2 stars.)"
4,"Not Great, But Very Enjoyable","This isn't a great musical in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition, or in the tradition of ""Singing In The Rain"", but it is enjoyable to watch. Frank Sinatra (in fine voice) walks through this, but Shirley MacLaine is a regular Energizer Bunny! Her quirky charm and dancing are shown off to full advantage...the ""Apache Dance"" number is a particular delight. Louis Jordan and Maurice Chevaliar, both fresh from a much better musical, ""Gigi"", give it a lot of class! The restoration print is great, and the film is visually delightful. It was filmed in the very wide screen Todd-A-O process, but unfortunately, there's no wide screen transfer. However, it still looks good, and with a great Cole Porter score and you have a very enjoyable two and a half hours!This is a two disc package and comes with extra's and information about the composer and filming."
2,Can Can Can't,"I was so excited when I received my Can Can dvd,being a big fan of Sinatra and Juliet Prowse.What a huge disappointment. I remember vaguely enjoying it in the sixties in Salisbury, Rhodesia on a big screen. Looking at Sinatra's performance today ,I am amazed that he delivered such a lackluster two-dimensional portrayal.He walked through the movie. He looked completely bored.Shirley Maclaine screeched her way like a cat on a hot tin roof.I'm amazed that people could be paid for delivering such dreary performances.Juliet Prowse danced like a star.Some memories are better left in the past."
4,Shirley for ever,"Shirley MacLaine est la star de cette comédie musicale bien filmée et bien rythmée, son rire est communicatif et son jeu de jambes impressionnant. C'est toujours un plaisir de revoir la fameuse scène où l'ivresse la rend particulièrement agressive et vulnérable. Non pas un chef d'oeuvre, mais un petit bijou magnifiquement restauré.Very commendable, of course."
4,Can-Can the musical,"An incredible restauration of a great musical that gets you, the viewer into the prudish style and mood of those times of irreverence and free spirit, with inocense and great musical talent. Maurice Chevalier and Sinatra at their best."
3,Can Can`t,"As much as I love the Cole Porter score, this is quite a mess of a movie. Too much of the Broadway score is missing. The cut songs are played under silly semi-rat pack scenes just to drive you crazy. Fox is not very good at putting these things together. Where is ""I Love Paris"" ? Cutting the biggest hit from this show was rather stupid. Go into the vault and don`t come out until you find it !"
4,When will we see Can-Can restored on DVD,"I have to say that I rmember seeing Can-Can in its origional roadshow presentation in Los Angeles in my younger days. It was a great time at the movies, and I remember the scope of the widescreen and all those Can-Can dancers. I hope that we will soon see a DVD with the fully restored format in Letterbox, With Ovature and Intermission etc. While not the best musical every filmed I remember it fondly and would like to see a DVD that presents this move as it should be seen. Widescreen format, stero sound et al."
3,Can-Can,"I believe this is a second release of this film, which cuts out all the intermissions and some of the original breaks. This takes away from the authenicity of the film on the original release. Please, this is like watching a movie in rerun format with chops and stops. IRRITATING. I borrowed my mother's copy of the original release and I hope that if this is released on DVD that this the original is the one they put on disk."
3,"The parts I thought were exeptionally good, the actors, ets.","""There is no trick, to a can can! It is so simple to do!"" And it is so simple to fall in love with this wonderful video, featuring some of Hollywood's biggest and best stars, Shirley McLane, Frank Sinatra, Maurice Chavaier, and Louis Jordan. This brilliant movie features wonderful songs like ""I Love Paris,"" ""Can Can,"" ""It's All Right With Me,"" ""C'est Magnifique,"" and many more, each more enchanting than the next, all put together by Cole Porter. From the wonderfully fun, upbeat dancing to the timeless songs, this movie is definatly worth seeing! Meredith Crawford, Age 12"
1,Great old time musicals,"It's great to relive the great musicals and films that kids, as well as adults, can see. Besides, what is better than a Sinatra musical?"
2,"A 1960's Rip-off of ""Gigi"" and an Embarassment to the Broadway Musical","It even copies ""Gigi""'s titles with Toulouse Lautrec-looking paintings. Frank Sinatra is absolutely wrong for the era--he even says ""ring-a-ding-ding"" in the Belle Epoch. Shirley Maclaine is scintillating and Chevalier is lost. Hollywood had to take the Broadway show which wasn't very good and put all the glitters on little puff of a musical.The arrangements are so sixties it could be a Sinatra solo album. They interpolated Cole Porter songs that just don't make it like ""Let's Do It.""Better to get John Huston's ""Moulin Rouge"" to get a real feel for the can-can."
5,Legendary musical!,"Can Can was the film that launched to overseas stages to Shirley Mac Laine one of the ten American actresses ever born. Based in the famous musical of Cole Porter of 1890s , this lackluster version involves to Frank Sinatra as the lawyer who will defend the rights of Miss Mac Laine to perform the daring dance in her nightclub. But the presence of the giants of the French song - Maurice Chevalier - and Louis Jordan makes of this musical a stand out musical still reminded after all these years."
1,Can Can,"This production was a great disappointment, as it bears little resemblence to the Broadway Show. We tossed it.John & Nancy Morse"
2,bad flickering and colour shift,"Although Fox have a nice sharp print,of Can Can,its somewhat spoiled by a bad flickering in certain parts and the color shift from the left hand side to the right hand side of the screen is badAnd this is on most parts of the film,like a public domain transfer.Another botch up like Oklahoma,The Todd AO Version.Great film though."
4,A classic!!!!,"This is one of the greatest musicals of all time. The songs all became well-loved hits, and are known to music lovers of all ages, even today.Frank Sinatra, Shirley Maclaine, Louis Jourdain & Maurice Chevalier got together to create a magical light love story, with fabulous singing and some good dance. The ""I Love Paris"" ballet is one of the classic dances of the screen, surpassed in my opinion only by Astaire-Rogers in Top Hat, the final ballet in American in Paris, John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever & Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing.The story line does wear a bit thin, with a somewhat silly ending in the cafe (movies made at that time sometimes suffered from this failing), but overall, this is still a classic.Why, oh why, is it not on DVD?????"
3,Exercises didn't work but has good info about eyes,"I religiously did the exercises for 2 months and I have not noticed any difference in my eyesight. I was skeptical to begin with but it's worth a shot since the book only costs 8 bucks. The book does contain some good basic medical information about the eye.I suspect some of the miracles that happened in other reviews were written my the marketers of AVI. It's a little hard to believe this tiny group of eye doctors when overwhelming medical evidence say eye exercies wont't correct vision. But like I said, it's worth a shot."
4,It works!,Follow the guidlines in this book and you'll be seeing a difference in your vision.It's just like exercising your body; you have to stretch muscles and make them work to be stronger. And this same concept applies to your eyes as well!
3,It's been over a month and I don't see a slight improvement,"I am impressed how much improvement people get in their vision when follow these exercises. Unfortunately, I am not one of them. I got this book and read it all,from the beggining to the end after my daughter had difficulty seeing and was prescribed eye glasses fro distance (-1.0). I wore glasses for almost 30 years, and now cannot see at all without them(-7.25); therefore, I wanted to do as much as I can for my daughter's vision. Like I said I have been doing exercises with my daughter for over the month now, and don't see any improvement in neither one of our vision. Not sure if i am doing something wrong... But book itself is the best I had so far. I have bought few of them, but this one is straight to the point, others are lenghty and not very clear."
3,I had a consultation with one of the authors,"I've been doing eye exercises, including the ones in this book, for about 10 years, and never worn glasses in all that time. The results? My eyesight is better, as determined by optometrists, when I keep up the exercises, considerably better too, but never seems to get beyond a certain limit. I guess the analogy is the guy with a missing leg who does physiotherapy. The physiotherapy helps mobility, but it isn't going to bring back the missing leg. That's basically what I was told when I finally went to see one of the authors of this book for a consultation. His final advice? Laser surgery. Apparently that's a really good option nowadays. So I'll look into it. Good luck folks."
1,If it sounds too good to be true - it probably is...,"If you're wondering if this method really works, please search the literature (try Pubmed). I guarantee that you will not find a single well-designed scientific study that shows even an ounce of proof that this works. While you're at it, search for papers that prove that glasses and contacts harm your vision.Optometrists and ophthalmologists are not just trying to make money off of you by prescribing glasses and contacts. Withholding information or treatment that would benefit you would go against medical ethics. Take these reviews with a (large) grain of salt."
1,don't bother,"It is unfortunate that some professionals imply that ""eye exercises"" and other vision therapy concepts can be used to change refractive error. No solid data support this concept, and it is instead promulgated by anecdotal information. If you feel your child or you has an eye problem please talk to your physician about it."
4,Nothing to lose,"Hi. After reading several of the reviews I decided to get the book and give it a try. I just began the eye exercises today 04/06/09. I will update you my progress next month. I don't have anything to lose for trying; at least I will get information on how to relax my eyes. And if this method works I will improve my vision, which is simply priceless. The current power of my lens is 1.75. I am aiming higher which is to dump my glasses altogether. During the month I will use my glasses only when absolutely necessary, such as driving. I will keep you posted on my progress."
5,Truly Useful!,"It's a thin book but it contains multiple exercises you can use to improve your vision or reduce computer eyestrain. It sort of takes the Bates Method and adds more to it. The authors don't waste a lot of time explaining the mechanics of vision but instead get you started with techniques you can immediately use and expand on. I've always had a much weaker right eye than the left and can feel these exercises working to relax the eye muscles in that eye that are actually locked in spasm, enabling improvement in focus. But you do have to faithfully do them and probably will have to always. Really learned a lot about my vision from this little book. Recommended."
2,"Has some good things to say, but it's not the Bates Method.","First I applaud the authors of this book for having the courage to deviate from the traditional thinking of their peers in the field of eye care. That said, I feel that the authors are still too ensconced in some of these old ways of thinking. For example, they state that becoming nearsighted after 40 is virtually inevatable. I am in my mid-40s and have had no indication of this even beginning to occur. In addition, how can this be so when many using the Bates Method have never had this condition, or have reversed it well after the age of 40?The book has some good things to say and some of the drills are worth while. It is certainly worth a look. However, my first recommendation is for the books by Bates and Quackenbush. My eyesight in each eye was worse than 20/200 when I started the Bates Method about a month ago, and now I can read the 20/70 line on the Snellen Chart most of the time."
1,there's more out there,"Just discarding glasses and actually beginning to use your vision a little differently can be enough to improve your vision a little, but I believe that complete relief of blurred vision will be obtained only rarely by just the methods described in this book. And the descriptions of the methods are very brief, leaving much open to guesswork and luck.This book is a component of the See Clearly Method, which includes aspects of the Bates method but this book is more mechanical and physically-oriented than the Bates method. The See Clearly Method has been advertised heavily and attracted a relatively large amount of attention compared to the Bates method, and this book has become popular as well, but there is a great deal more information about vision improvement out there than is contained in this book, and I invite you to research the subject further.I am an advocate of the Bates method."
5,My eyes have been opened,This is a great resource for those concerned with their annual loss of vision. Stop losing out on good vision and improve it today by reading this book.
1,"It does not work, it makes your vision even poorer","I started doing the exercises on the 14th October 2010, from -3.0 it got worse to -4.0 in 2 months! I blame the stupid light therapy for it, I was warming my eyes with a light bulb and here I am with a stronger prescription.Terrible experience, the authors are cheating us all."
5,one of the best,"This in my opinion was one of the best tapes of FY avalible to buy currently. It has everything you could want, love, action, humor, adventure, betrayal.. it's just so good and it'll keep you and your friends on the edge of your seats! if you havent seen Buy BUy BUY!"
4,A cute and charming movie,This movie is a perfect mix of romance and comedy. The plot is interesting and the cast is great. Deborah Gibson is wonderful in the film.
3,Deborah Gibson in Doris Dayesque Role...,"Right from the beginning credits with the cute animation & Deborah Gibson singing the title tune, I felt like this was a comedy Doris Day (another pop singer who acted in films) would have starred in. It was like one of Miss Day's 60's screwball comedies with a gay 90's twist. A fun, fluffy film."
4,Wonderful choice for movie night,"This is a sweet, very charming and funny bit of fluff that's great for when you want to just watch something entertaining and not too serious. Think along the lines of ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" with a smaller budget and less well known stars, but that same kind of script. Lots of witty lines and slapstick humor. Speaking of the actors, the entire cast is appealing. You've just got to love the poor straight guy, who is SO nice to all these lunatics who keep taking advantage of him. I will say, while this movie is fun, by no means is it worth the money. Rent it from Blockbuster instead."
2,This series is a big disappointment.,"This series of DVDs seemed to have great promise when announced ... a re-release of out-of-print material previously released by Pioneer and Geneon, with the mention of improved sound quality. This series may have slightly better sound but is painfully lacking due to having been ruthlessly edited. Why they would do this seems incredible ... whole chunks of the shows are missing and the promised extra material is minimal. Searching out used copies of the previous releases would be much more satisfying, if you want my advice. I bought Volume 1 but was unhappy with it. Volume 2 just arrived today and is equally poorly done. I am returning it for refund. Such a huge disappointment."
5,Three Perfect Friendships,What can I say? Other than I am glad this book was reissued. Ms Palfrey has shown how three mature friends can influence the men as well as the community. This is one book I intend to read over and over.
5,PHENOMENAL,great story about friendship and love. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I wanted more. Evelyn Palfrey you are one of my favorite writers. Keep up the great work. I wish you much success. Be Blessed!
3,Track listing,"Amazon's track listing is wrong, and gives the impression that this is a 2-track single. The 14 tracks on this album are separated into two mixes, the first lasting a bit over 23 minutes, the second a bit over 33 minutes.Tracklisting:1 Turtle2 Sparticus3 Dougga4 El Jem5 Quo Vardis6 Mars7 Second Legion8 Do It9 Zone10 Northern Tribes11 Attack12 House Of Vetti13 Vandals14 Legion"
1,Piece of Junk!,"This cd player is a piece of junk. I understand not having skip-protection, but this is ridiculous. You're sitting at the keyboard, with this player, and the cat, across the room, jumps off the table too hard. Skip..skip..it's also incredibly battery hungry, batteries last an average of three hours. It's no darn good for anything but sitting perfectly still. So unless you're incredibly patient, spend a little more for at least 30-seconds of shock protection. Please."
2,America's Popular Sayings,"I thought this book would give the origins of sayings, not just a dictionary of sayings. I was interested in who came up with them, not just a list of sayings in general. I could have done better research. Very happy with the vender."
2,Not the remote for you....,"This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon.com. That should tell you something. Normally I am not the type of person to complain about certain products but when one is as bad as this I have to speak up.First off I will say for about the first 8-9 months the remote worked just fine but after that, frequently pushed buttons stopped functioning. I got around that by changing those functions to a different button... then those stopped functioning.I have had another Learning Universal Remote that has lasted me 10 years so I know I am not asking much when I would like a remote to last me more than a year. I bought this remote after reading reviews on here about it, I hope someone will see this review and think twice before spending 50 bucks on something that won't last more than a few months."
5,Great Remote Control - From Brazil,"I'm from Brasil and bougth this RCU. I have internationals devices and others, like sattelite decoder 'Gradiente', dvd player 'Philco', reciever 'Sony', TV 'JVC' and a Video RCA.The Sony RMVL 900 control everything!The DVD and Sattelite decoder were not in the manual list's, however, the learning function makes the RCU control all devices."
2,Great... for 2 weeks,"This remote was simply to program and worked great, better than great. Then after two weeks buttons just stopped responding. It wasnt the batteries and it wasnt that they needed to be reprogrammed, they just stopped working. I rarely write a bad review and i read all the good ones before purchasing this."
2,The Almost Remote,"This remote was great in the beginning. I was able to program it to use 99% of all of my systems, but the main problem I have is that the remote defaults to the TV setting after almost every use! This drives me nuts! I'll be using the AMP feature [which I use 90% of the time as all of my components DVD, VCR, etc all go into my AMP] and two seconds later it defaults back to the TV. This is enough to give it only two stars. I'm very disappointed that I spent on this remote."
1,Worked Well...For a While,"I bought this Sony remote in July 2003. It worked just fine with my 27"" Panasonic TV. Recently it started losing channel up/down function, and today this went completely (replaced batteries, tried reprogramming-unsuccessful)! PIP functions and everything else still work. I am very disappointed in this product-for $50+, and being Sony, you expect reliability.The only replacement Universal Remote I can recommend is the Home Theater Master MX-500, which I've had for 2 years now. It has worked flawlessly...of course, it costs $100 or more. Just what is the problem with remote reliability?"
1,Why you should not buy it...,"At first glance, this remote control was great. After few month of utilisation, what is write on key begun desapear... After one year, button begun to be harder to push. After 2 year now, some key are dead and I'm surfing the net right now to buy another remote control.Dont buy this crap."
5,Great idea!,"I purchased this item for my four year old cousin, and he LOVES it! The information is completely accurate, and the design is very appealing. The quality of the curtain is amazing--I've never purchased this type of vinyl curtain before, and I really love how silky it feels. A huge difference from the stiffy, stinky PVC curtains. I can't wait to see what products will be launched next!"
3,Great idea in theory,"I loved the idea of this curtain, as it was to hang on the shower in the bathroom adjoining our homeschool room. It is a cute idea and has a colorful design; but somehow the illustration makes it look less like a basic vinyl shower curtain - which is what it is. We decided to keep it, but thought it should cost about half of what it does."
2,Underdogs and Tricksters,"I was looking for a book about Jacob from the Old Testament to give to my grandson, named Jacob, for his Confirmation. This is entirely over my head, much less his, so am very disappointed that I bought it."
4,Just product info,"from the Routledge website:This comprehensive and accessible student workbook accompanies the fifth edition of Albert C. Baugh and Thomas Cable'sHistory of the English Language, A (5th Edition).Each chapter in the workbook corresponds directly to a chapter in the textbook and offers exercises, review questions, extensive supplementary examples, additional explanations and a range of sample extracts taken from texts of different periods.

[...]"
1,This book is so LAME,"There are very few things that I actually call ""lame,"" although this book is certainly one of them. Reading through other reader's responses on this novel I was truly shocked that anyone in their right mind would give this book five stars--I didn't even want to give it a whole star... Hornburg's thinly-veiled autobiography was dull, dull and dull...along with horribly developed characters, the storyline is weak and there is no plot to speak of. It is a book filled with stereotypical hip-kids and urbanites---the stripper with the heart of gold; the aspiring, somewhat tormented filmaker whom no one understands; the ex-roomate who is secretly in love with David (aka Michael Hornburg)... Bad, bad, bad. Save your mone and time read something good."
5,The best book of it's time,"I read this book sometime ago, but have read it a few times since. i found the book completely compelling and suggest it to anyone who likes a good fiction about the sreets of Portland. i also suggest ""Candy"" by Luke Davies."
2,Is Pot All You Got?,"Too many people I know are duped by the idea that THC equals reality. It's just a chemical like any other. Believe me, I'm not against using any drug, but I will say glorification is weak, immature, and a waste. Bongwater, by its mere title alone cries to the baked teenybopper browsing the bookstore who still thinks gettin' high is ""cool."" Granted, this book offers the life Hornburg knew and it's written smoothly enough; but books deserve substance, thought, and responsibility. Everybody knows the drug path. It's the road most traveled. If you're going to write about it, at least have the courage to paint the entire picture."
1,Dont waste your time,This book is absolutely horrible. Amazon recomended it to me so I bought it and wasted my money dont buy it it sucks.
5,Wow.,"This book catpuredthe escence of young adults just trying to make it on their own with various problems, all victims to circumstance. Though i can not directly relate, it is by far the best book i have ever read."
4,It's a great book that captures the essence of the late 90's,"I really liked this book. Even though *I* found it a little hard to relate to the charaters,being much younger then anyone in the story,some of the characters remind me of people i know. It's very vivid,and you really get into the charaters' lives. In short,i found this to be a great book and definatly worth reading."
5,Riveting!,"This is a fast read filled with witty dialogue, clear prose, believable characters, and a charmingly humblehearted narrator-persona. And not without its poignant moments. Some if the chapter endings, in particular, give pause. An example is when Jennifer, in an effort to calm her friend Courtney from her fear of plane-travel, says the view from the plane is like ""the viewpoint of God."" Courtney tells her not to say that, and when Jennifer asks why, Courtney says, ""Because I don't see any people down there."" Hornburg tackles-and more notably, articulates-the larger, timeless, ageless, genderless questions that fill up not only Jennifer and Courtney, but also each and every one of us-one moment with awe, the next moment with terror-as we stare out our ""small plastic window[s], lean forward and look back"" at the complicated, unpredictable roadways of our lives. Hornburg helps us make sense of it all. Bravo!"
1,This book depressed me.,"It looks great. I like the title. I wanted to like it. But it made me really sad. I read it in one night, and was grateful that was all the time I spent on it. Somehow the interaction of the characters was unfulfilling and their motives--and dialogue--completely unbelievable. No one seemed to have an inner life, much less a past, or even satisfying sex. Perhaps the writer was trying to subvert a typical first, coming-of-age novel, and so none of the main characters had an epiphany or even any apparent growth. Reading this made me happy about all the conventional, good novels, where someone changes, goes through adversity, figures something out. There is some style here, though, and perhaps Hornberg's next effort will be better. I wish him luck."
2,Unhappily Incomplete,"This edition reprints the John Clark translation published by the Military Publishing Company in 1944. Like that edition, it includes only three of the five books of the EPITOME REI MILITARIS. The Amazon reviews praising the influence of Vegetius nicely summarize the book's introduction, but persons willing to get the most for their money can get the same three parts, and much more, in Thomas Phillips' ROOTS OF STRATEGY. The sole advantage this edition has over that anthology is that it is illustrated."
3,Nice Story,This is a fun trilogy. I like the first two books but the third kind of lost me. It's great for teens.
3,Good but not great,"Gallagher does a good job of putting together collections of essays on civil war topics. I bought this one mainly because I tend to agree with Gallagher's opinion that Gettysburg is only in hindsight the main turning point or high water mark of the war. The battle was undoubtedly a horrible defeat for Lee, but if it was such a death blow, why way Lee able to send his best corps to Georgia a month later and keep it there for over eight months? There were no major battles in Virginia for almost a year after Gettysburg. I see Bragg's failure at Chattanooga to be a much bigger turning point. The war was all downhill for the South after Chattanooga."
5,Great shoes,"My daughter loved these shoes and she is VERY picky when it comes to what she wears, they are pretty looking, comfortable and good quality. i actually went back to the site and wanted to purchase 2 more pairs since they were in a great price and worth every penny, but they were sold out. I was happy i managed to get them. i wish there were more great deals like this one."
4,Highly informative to experienced SQL 2000 DBAs,"This book is written primarily for the experienced SQL 2000 DBAs who need to know the additions and changes of SQL 2005. Even though SQL 2005 is substantially different from SQL 2000, they are also highly similar. The book focuses on the differences.As most SQL books, the book lacks details on transactions and locking. Also, data mirroring and replication could have been more detailed and refined.Given this was one of the first SQL 2005 books on the market, I was surprised at the level of detail outlined in this book. The author clearly understands the nuances of SQL 2005.Overall, I highly recommend this book to those who are already familiar with SQL 2000. It will confuse those who are just starting with MS SQL."
3,A Little Goes A Long Way,"I recommend saving yourself some money and buying the smallest bottle you can find.Sun Moon & Stars is a nice perfume, but just like some people, it's nice in small doses. I like to spray it about 18'' away from me and just let a fine mist fall on me. A couple sprays like this lasts me all day, and this is coming from somebody who likes strong smells. It has an etherial powdery floral smell, and a subtle fresh peach scent. Another reviewer put it best that it has a distinctive ozone note to it. For me this is why it is best used sparingly."
5,This is very funny...,"This guy is freakin old clown dudes he rocks!!!!!if you are mexican or latin, try to hear his jokes..."
5,Hard-to-find fun!,"Unlike Excalibur Hearts, which doesn't keep score correctly, Bridge seems to do just fine. Recommended!"
1,Electronic Handheld bridge game,It was soooo bad even the distributor didn't want it back. I know how to play bridge and am computer literate but this hand held is something else.
4,Professional Shoe Fitting Manual,Very accurate in fitting procedures. Good basic anatomy and biomechanics information. Great reading for people in the foot health industry
3,Captured,"Captured is a very difficult movie to watch. The emotions run high for all of the major characters, with no let up. The ""Hero"" becomes a vigilantie ; the car thief becomes the victim. While the two lead characters battled with each other; I was disappointed to see the younger brother, Joey ( Michael Mahonen; who is a brilliant Canadian actor) left with little or nothing to do. I wish his part had not been cut so drastically. His was the part of the younger, devoted brother. His character could have taken some of the brutality of the film and ballanced it with family loyalty; creating a little sympathy from the viewer... making an emotional attachment we could empathise with. But, no...it went from one brutal and harsh scene to the next. The film has some remdeming qualities, I just wish there had been a little more of Joey, to balance the plot..."
5,HARDCORE ON THA REAL TIP,"THIS CD IZ THA BOMB STRAITE UP ON THA REAL TIP, EL DEMONIO PUTZ IT DOWN FOR THA LATINO'Z. AL THA TRAX ARE THA SH#T!! U FEEL ME..."
1,Same Song Second Verse,"I wish I had went with my gut instinct and taken the advise of the other reviewers that had less than two thumbs up for this product and Viking Tech Support. 3 sets of modules later my system still does not find the modules compatiable and Viking support states that there is nothing more they can do ""Our information says that they should work"". So much for their information. And so far I have had no response from Viking about returning the product and receiving credit. By the way you will have to deal directly with Viking for returns, Amazon does not assist in this area expect to provide you with an e-mail address and 1-800 #. So my advise to you is to contact your system's maker and find out from them if your system will take Viking's products."
3,"Good Mix, But not what I expected","What the heck happened with GLO? They have this new sound that is far from the ""logical"" progession and atmospheric sound that made Bukem so intoxicating. Progession Session 5..remember track 1 and how it started out and then changing moods on tracks 3 & 4? Progession Sessions 6 was maybe as far as I'd go in actually liking what was being played. Someone needs to bring back that vibe that seems to be all but forgotten."
3,Not quite what I thought,"The Version 2.0 thing threw me off and I didn't even check the publish date (silly me). I thought it was for the new .NET 2.0 Framework. It's not.Some of the OO stuff is really really glossed over in this book. It definitely assumes you have a solid OO background, which, unfortunately, I do not. I guess it's time to try to read through that old gang of four book, but it sure is friggin' dry."
4,Great book for enterprise application.,"This book covered material for those people work in enterprise level enviornments who are concern about their servers and wanted to keep their servers running 24X7.This is a book for those professional want to enhance their professional skills and work in distributed system environment (Clustered Servers).This book give you a good guidance to design great applications in simple readable manner. It covered areas such as Client Tier, Application Tier, Web Tier, and Data Tier. It shows how the .Net Service inter-related and gives you an overview of the .Net framework architect.The book give you better understand of where .Net is heading and how to organize your programming structure along with your server configuration etc.,"
2,Not sure where the .NET comes in,"I was somewhat disappointed by this book. Granted, there are (very) high-level pattern descriptions, and I'm sure all of these can be handled by .NET. However, the authors shy away from actually pointing out where .NET comes into the play here.Maybe my expectations were incorrect, but I had expected a more hands-on than philosophical (almost-marketing) work."
4,Excellent noir novel,"The 1950s were the Golden Age for pulp paperbacks, and many of those books were great. However, a lot of them were not very good. They lacked an exciting plot and/or compelling characters. Honky Tonk Girl by Charles Beckman Jr. is a very pleasant surprise. It's a gritty story of a band whose musicians are being killed off one by one. The leader is the central character and is well-drawn in three dimensions. Meanwhile, the top dog in town wants him gone and has enlisted the help of local law enforcement. A hard-as-nails story set in a surprisingly vivid bad part of town."
1,Not For Everyone,"I gave this book to 45 participants in an innovative leadership training class as a pre-reading exercise. They gave it back to me because of the following reasons: the layout is difficult to follow, you need a glossary to keep up with the acronyms. and what exactly is the point here!"
2,unreadable,"I was truly annoyed by his random writing style and the book's lousy layout. Look at the cover---the inside is just as chaotic. I bailed after 15 pages or so. Too bad, as he has some good things to say, but it wasn't worth the effort. As a design advocate I'm amazed that his book designs are so ineffective and shoddy. He loves design but not graphic design?..."
1,Tom Peters Unplugged,"I am a big fan of Peters. This book is not Peters at his best. Actually, this can only be called a book because it has a front and back cover and pages in between. The whole thing is just a lot of short, often unrelated snippets of information, with a lot of curse-words included to give it some spice. You need a road map to keep up with all the acronyms he uses. Did Tom Peters actually write this book?"
4,A Great Series,"Dead Ends,like all of Ms Fallon's mysteries, takes place in Ireland. Ann Fallon's Ireland, however, is not merely a locale but an atmosphere, a state of mind. Her characters are so uniquely Irish, so softly alien to this American reader. Her plots can be (and usually are) rocky and unforgiving but her people soften and sweeten the harsh realities of murder. Her books are different, and in this case, that's exactly what makes them good."
2,Not as good as the reviews make it out to be...,"I oredered this product strictly based on the review's on Amazon.com, like most other things I buy. It was okay, but I was not impressed. I personally think that it smells a little cheap, but keep in mind that the last perfume I tried was 'Micheal Kors.' 'Micheal Kors' lasted for a really long time. I sprayed it on my sweatshirt and didn't wear it for a couple days, then when I went to wear it again it still smelled of the fragrance. When I sprayed on 'Pure,' I could not even smell it a few hours later. 'Pure,' has a floraly scent and somewhat reminds me of the old 'Exclaimation' perfume."
2,MAYBE IT WAS THE VENDOR...BUT,"I bought this product expecting it to be a new and refreshing scent that lasted (at least) through the morning/afternoon. I was, however, disappointed. Not only does this perfume smell like pure alcohol (ie. not an original scent, and in fact, no real scent at all), but, even the pure alcohol smell (thankfully..sorta) didnt last more than ten minutes. I would literally spray it on each day (hoping that maybe there would be scent that was just delayed in coming from the bottle somehow) and within five minutes, I would smell absolutely nothing (nothing good and nothing bad).Now, maybe it was just the specific vendor that I bought this product from (as I noticed several different vendors of this product on Amazon), but, this product is not worth it.There isnt even a lot of liquid in the bottle.Definitely not something to spend your hard-earned or even easy-earned money on!"
3,Required Read,"I had to read this for a college English class. It is a quick read but very hard to stay interested, and to follow. This is a hard to find book half of my class couldn't find it. I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a ""just for fun read""."
2,Disappointing,"This was a very disappointing book. The idea behind it was interesting and I enjoy reading about that period in history, but the character interactions were all poorly done. The brother/priest who comes to hear Huitzitzitl's confession is wraught with historical innacuracies. There is no way he would have acted the way Limon has him act. He also seems to me to be a very incompetent priest. I kept reading this book, hoping it would get better, but it never did and in the end I was left with a feeling of discontent and that I had wasted my time. Save yourself the trouble. For a good novel of this era try Captain from Castile by Samuel Shellabarger. You can probably find it on alibris or some used book website."
3,Read Gary Jennings Instead,"If I hadn't already read Gary Jennings ""Aztec"" I probably would have liked this book much better. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The main character, Huitzitzilin, is great, but the the Priest was AWFUL. One minute he'd be shocked and appalled by what she said, and the next, all of a sudden and lo and behold! he was feeling compassion and understanding for her. Completely not believable.On the other hand, the Gary Jennings book is basically the same story (written PRIOR to Song of the Hummingbird) about an elderly Mexica man, and really built up the characters, made you a part of their lives and was a truly entertaining way to digest the history of this subject.Read Jennings instead."
3,A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE MIND,"This book, Song of the Hummingbird, was very interesting to me, because it is one of the first books that I read that is based upon my Aztec Ancestors.When I read the summary on the back of the book it seemed to me that I would be very impressed with the story. I realized when I began to read the first two chapters I wasn't very impressed. Huitzitzilin had an interesting but not attracting story, as many people agree. She told her story of a young girl that was a princess to a slave. I would not recommend this story to just anyone this story is for some one that would like to learn information about Aztec culture. Otherwise you will tend to not understand much."
3,o.k.,for the price this tripod is o.k. it is a bit unstable when fully extended. could have gotten it on e-bay for half the price.
1,A very bad product that might have been quite good,"...unless they hadn't insisted on the ""geared"" telescopic part. It has some sort of swivel that is supposed to raise and lower it, but the handle is the cheapest possible plastic and it broke the very first time I used it. It's extremely annoying because overall it's not a bad tripod, but it really didn't need that bit of ""hi-tech"", and now I am unable to use the telescopic part at all...Yes, it's lightweight and somewhat unstable, but I can live with that. The biggest problem is the bad engineering and the subpar materials..."
4,Terrific Tripod,The best buy in the marketplace. It easily fits into my suitcase for travel...the level works nicely and very sturdy for as light as it is.
5,Sturdy and easy to use,"I love my tripod. It is sturdy and easy to use. My only problem is I have lost one of my quick release shoes. I'm looking for more. I'm not sure they sell them seperately. That would be a shame. However, the tripod itself is great.Enjoy."
5,Choose this book to Choose the Life,"Hull has hit it on the head. After many years as a pulpiteer, even preaching discipling, he faced the poverty of his approach. His is a radically biblical call back to personally making disciples. Pastors wrapped up in programs or power or personality and not people won't like this book. Pastor, return to what God called you to in the beginning - not pleasing people but making true disciples of Christ and, in the PROCESS (not purpose-driven, you notice), you will become one yourself."
5,nice to assemble,Assembling this model was a fun experience. It even came with a story about pirates that was educational. I enjoyed putting this together and painting the pirates!
3,It wasn't what I thought it was,"I was expecting the ship to be more than it was. Example - the sails were made out of paper. I know I shouldn't have expected museum quality for $20, but it was a birthday gift. I could see that my friend wasn't that excited about it when he saw that it wasn't as detailed as he thought. If you want a plastic pirate ship with paper sails for you to glue together and paint, then this is the one for you."
3,Pendent is hollow,I just bought this item as a gift. When I received it I found it to be very light weight. When tapped the face has a hollow sound. It is very nice looking but I am worried that under everyday conditions the pendant may dent and collapse. Especially since I did get this item to be worn under a bullet proof vest of an active officer. I'll write back to let you know if it holds up.Edit: It has been nearly a year and it still is holding up well.
3,a good book for small groups,our small group Bible Study is using this book; having the leader's guide at the back is a big help.The chapters are short enough to finish in the time allowed.
3,A little too late,The book was in good condition. However I waited over 2 weeks for the book to arrive. I did not have the book in time for the 1st week of lessons. I ordered it over a week ahead so I could get the book in time before the 1st week of lessons.
3,Toshiba's have the same problem,I got a Toshiba 32af41 and it has the same geometry distortion in the upper left corner. From what I've read almost all flat tube TVs have this problem. Buyer beware.
4,BLOODY BLOODY VENGEANCE IS BLOODY FUN!,"I, a huge fan of asian cinema loved this movie. It is definately one of the best asian movies and it is great. It is artistic and dreamy. It is a blood-soaked, beautiful revenge story, and it is great. I can see why quentin tarantino used it as inspiration for another one of my favorite movies KILL BILL!"
2,a very elementary screenplay,"this revenge movie copied a lot of ideas from dumas' novol only changed it with a female character. it's with a loose and even a bit simple-minded comic book like storyline. since it's titled with a word of 'blood', the whole movie was full of red blood. the directing of this movie was very primitive too."
4,It's Better Than I Thought,"On an earlier review, I stated that you could not get PinP, (picture in picture), with this unit. It states in the manual that PinP is not provided, but you can get it. Press the CMD button and the W button together, for PinP. then press CMD and M together to change the position of the PinP. After realizing this, I'd have to say that I like this keyboard the best, of the different Webtv compatable keyboards. This is really comfortable, when you have to use the keyboard for long periods."
2,Not the keyboard you are used to.,"I needed a replacement keyboard for my webTV. I ordered this one because like it would be more comfortable to hold. It is not! It is big and bulky, and my hands actually get sore from it. While it works as it should. There are many buttons moved around and a lot missing all together. There are no ""F"" keys....instead there are a lot of keys on top that don't do anything for the web tv. Also, I don't know if this is just on the one I got or not, but the keys stick and will not type 2 letters or numbers that are the same in a row. The seller I got this from was great...fast shipping. But unless you are desperate for a replacement kb for your webtv....go with the regular one. Now I am going to order the regular one now and keep this one as a spare."
3,Convienent keyboard,Never had a problem with it since it's introduction into the world wide web but the dinasaur has become a memory.
2,Clarinet Jazz,"While this cd contains a well rounded selection of various Jazz pieces, no piece really stands out as being utterly incredible. This cd is recommended for only the true jazz enthusiast."
5,Excellent product,"Much better quality than expected. Since I am short person, the height of the handles is ideal. Quickly shipped. Pkg'ing was great."
3,broom and dustpan,"I notice from the pictures.The brooms were blue, but I receive 10 very bright green. I was upset, but I did not know why green and not blue. What happen.........Should I have called or sent them back. But it was the christmas holidays so I was stuck with green and just stuck a red ribbon on them. So, my staff just look at me like I was crazy for the holidays. They really wanted blue. Now, I stuck on green. Thank you for your services.Patricia"
1,Terrible,The dustpan does not lay flat so dirt goes under it when you are trying to sweep stuff up. The broom is also VERY small.
1,Do not buy,"When I read the reviews about it being short, I figured it would be ok for me since I am short. Nope. Even uncomfortable to use for me! And, the brush width is RIDICULOUSLY short. What a waste."
1,little broom is awkward to use,"The dust pan is OK, but I find the rubber lip on the bottom to be too thick. It will take a couple of sweepings to get mess up into pan. I use the little broom from another set, because this one is just too awkward to use; the way it can be turned is unfortunate. It just doesn't work for me."
2,Dustpan and broom,"This item is very poorly made. It is cheap plastic and rather flimsy. It does not stay open when you stand it up and when you put the broom into its' slot on the duspan, the bristles start coming out. I would not recommend this product. Save yourself money, don't buy it!"
5,Excellent Service,"I ordered this early in the morning, and was surprised to see it had shipped a few hours later!Received it the next day and it is a great product. Just as advertised.This has to be the very best fast service I have had yet. Very satisfied with the seller! Thanks"
4,Great for home haircut clean up.,A friend cuts my hair in my apartment kitchen and I use this to sweep up my cut hair on the floor immediately afterwards. I only use it for this situation because I feel that some hair will stay embedded in the broom so it's great that the broom stays inside the butler until next haircut and dosn't shed on the floor. Because it is Stand-up I can place it in a narrow area on the side of my washer. Does everything I wanted it to do.
5,Becky B,Excellent quality broom/dust pan. I Couldn't find a stand up dust pan at a descent price anywhere else. :)
3,Could be better,"True, the broom is short but I only use it for fast clean-ups. I like the swivel part because you can reach under the cabinet and around objects better. The dumb part is the holder for the broom. They made a little pocket for the broom to fit into but you bend the bristles trying to get the broom into the pocket... useless."
1,child size broom,teeny tiny broom. Looks like a child's toy. The dustpan seems like it will be ok though. I would not buy again.
5,great dustpan,I love the dustpan--nothing gets swept under it and it keeps dirt inside. The broom is rather superfluous--it is short and the pivot head makes it hard to sweep sometimes. I use a different broom and love the dustpan.
1,not the book I ordered,"I ordered this book thinking as if it is new edition. When I placed order I thought it is really the new edition but when I received it, I saw that it was old edition. I tried to contact for return but no help. I never opened this book and it is lying in its original open box doing no good to me. I already have this edition. I don't know wheat to do with this book now."
4,A book of lists!,"This review book of neonatology covers the subject well, primarly with a series of lists that are organized in accordance with the various body systems. These lists cover rather extensively the various number of conditions/diseases but ocassionally in a rather brief fashion. I did find the endless pages of lists to get rather ""hypnotizing"" but the information is excellent and everything one needs for an thorough review of neonatology is found in this book. A brillant bonus is in the last few pages which distills vital formulas that one is sure to need for board exams."
2,"Well, ummm, er....uh....","The other reviews are so glowing. I guess it must just chalk up to taste in movies.Depressing because you could see where it was going from the start.The best part: Jeff Fahey did a great job with the voice and the Danish accent, brief as his dialogue was. 5 words?To think I put up with all the rest just to see that."
4,"Jack Herer, a real American hero","Emperor of Hemp is a brief documentary about hemp activist and author Jack Herer. This film documents his life from Goldwater Republican to the ""emperor"" of hemp activism. It includes footage from protests, as well as interviews with Jack, close friends, and work partners.Although the film is only 60 minutes long, it also includes a brief history of the illegalization of the marijuana plant and the history of the hemp plant as a multi-purpose crop grown around the world, and even grown by our first president George Washington.I hadn't heard of Jack Herer before watching this documentary, and now I'm glad that I have. He wrote the book ""The Emperor Wears No Clothes"", which is a very detailed and well-researched account of the uses of hemp and the reasons it was made illegal.Overall, this movie is very interesting, and should be viewed by anyone interested in finding out more about hemp and/or the man who started the hemp movement in this country."
5,An Honest Documentary on the History of Hemp,"""Emperor of Hemp"" is not a pro-marijuana film, although the historical, political, and medical story of the hemp plant makes a compelling argument that the prohibition of hemp products was more about political insiders and corporate control over government process than any honest concern for the well-being of the American populace. This film is beautifully produced. It is interesting, entertaining, and informative, even for those (like myself) who are completely detached from the world of hemp/marijuana. The realized and unrealized potential of the hemp plant is staggering, and this film clearly demonstrates how our country is being needlessly deprived of one of nature's most diverse and valuable renewable resources."
3,"Its OK, not recommended.","Very powerful pump in this machine. Lots of crema on your espresso. Its been going strong for 1.5 years.Problems are with the internal hoses and the instructions. The hoses are soft surgical tubing and leave a nasty taste through the steamer, so i dont use it. I dont notice any off-flavors in the coffee. Worst of all are the instructions. Good luck understanding the process for re-priming the pump after each refill of the reservoir. We got it to work through guesswork. The lights on the front panel take some getting used to also- Turn on the first button which lights the first TWO buttons, wait for the second button's light to go OUT, then press the second button to start the pump. Ha!"
5,Always on the go,This is a machine that will look good wherever you put it. Simple yet classic design and so easy to use. A quick push of a button and that's all there is to it.
5,Outstanding Performance,"I received my grace machine after much researching on which machines had the most power, pump size and materials that the machine is made of, (not the plastic or metal covers) but on the inside. It heats up so fast that some times I get confused if the hot light means ready or not. I have not found an equal to this machine for the specifications for the money. I would recomend it to my mother and to a total stranger like you."
4,Good performance for the price,"I purchased this unit in Dec.'04 for my girl friend, who was a pro barista , for Christmas. The quality and performance of this unit is excellent, so far. She says it has plenty of pressure to froth milk in a short amount of time unlike cheaper home units and it heats up real fast. We use it several times a month but not daily. Some reviewers who use it multiple times a day everyday have had problems but those type of users should already be into a commercial unit, in my opinion. If this machine broke I would fix it because it performs so well. Highly recommended for moderate use."
2,Worked great until a few days ago.,"We bought this motor in April 2011, and a few days ago it just stopped. So it was nice for a year, but since this summer is already hot, it sucks that it went out after only 1 yr!!"
4,Great Price! Great Service!,I am very happy with this replacement Blower Motor for my 2000 Dodge Grand Caravan. The only modification I had to make was on the male connector from the new motor since it was not compatible with the original female connector on the vehicle. I simply cut off the male connector from the new motor and spliced the old male connector from the worn out motor. Used the usual wire nuts and taped each leg real tight with electrician's tape. Black wire to Black wire and the other color to the other. The price was less than half of what the local Auto Supply Store quoted me and I received this item 4 days after I ordered it with FREE SHIPPING.
5,An astounding life of a saint,I first read this many years ago and it was a favorite book of mine. The Cure d'ars was such a saintly man-and this book was wonderfully inspiring to read. A treasure.
5,Excellent Murder Mystery with a Great Wine Flavor,"Whether you live in the Napa Valley, or just enjoy visiting it, you'll love the setting of this book. Sunny, the main character, is a lovable, but unintentional sleuth intent on solving a murder. If you're a wine fan, you'll love the references to real wines in the book, learn a little, and enjoy the aromas of a great mystery! I've already purchased her other book!"
3,A good summer read,"I rated this as a good summer read because it has some good points. Nice details about the Napa Valley area. I thought the story line was a little off, but it played out with good suspence. The development of the characters left me wondering more about the characters as they seemed very one-dimensional. The heavy cross-referencing to food and wine felt either forced or pretentious...not sure which. Without giving away the plot, it sometimes assisted, sometimes detracted from the story line, although I understand where it was heading. Again, all in all, a good read to curl up with a glass of wine."
3,Tenacity becomes ridiculous,Sunny spends a large part of her time making something of nothing and approaching strangers in a way that made me uncomfortable. Pleasant writing style overshadowed by the lack of realism.
2,Didn't finish the book,"Maybe it is me, but I could not get into this book. I didn't even finish it, that is how little it interested me. Disappointing."
3,Not one of Ms. Harry better book,"""A Promise to Keep"" by Lilian Harry is the follow-up to ""A Girl called Thursday"" I was really looking forward to this book, but after reading it, I have to say disappointed. It just did not seem up to Ms. Harry's normal standards. I found it hard to keep up when flashbacks happen. The book also seem slow in places and the book lost my interest in places. Fans of War-time settings do enjoy Ms. Harry's books, but you may want to skip ""A Promise to Keep"""
3,"EXCELLENT GAME, but OURAGEOUS FEE!","This game very wicked and also so realitic it'd looked like you're the one on the screen! Although the game is excellent, the game fee is crazy!! They expect us to pay 13$ a month, come on! We have better things to do than play games all day! If the fee can down to like 7& or less, than I'd buy it and play it all day! Unfortunately, I was going to buy it but the fact that the fee is soo high, I've decided to buy .hack//Outbreak and ontinue the .hack Series. Sorry Square, I love all your games but this fee is just crazy!"
3,Pixelated graphics?,"Just a quick counter point to those that say the PC versions graphics are pixelated. If you have a nice video card with bump mapping turned on, and full resolution (1280x1024) it looks beautiful, even in extreme closeups.On the other hand, the game can be fairly boring. I am NOT a fanboy for he Final Fantasy series. In fact, I really only liked the first 3. This is an average MMORPG."
2,Review after 80 hours.,"I played this game for about 80 hours, then quit completely. The reason for this is because the game is so boring in the beginning, it makes you want to tear up the disk and throw it at the creators.Ok so I'll be fair and give you some pros...and of course cons.Pros------------------1.Nice graphis with high res, and fair battle engine.2.Rewarding game after you play for about 200-300+ hours.3.Fast load.Cons------------------1.If you want to play this game with a friend, your friend has to go in-game and spend a considerable abount of gil (money) on something called a 'World Pass'. This allows you to make your character on their server, but can only be used once.2.Very slow traveling and leveling.3.Expensive fee.4.Need a friend in real life before you start this game to help you.As you can see in my review, the cons overshadow the pros."
2,Great at first,"I played this game from the beta, then of course bought the retail to keep playing with the friends i had made. After playing for a while i noticed a severe flaw in the game design... there are only about 8 types of creatures in the game. All they did was change the monsters pictures a tiny bit ( say a different weapon in hand or a different color) throughout the first 60 lvls of the game i noticed this. I would be fighting beetles then crabs and goblins at lvl 11, then them again at lvl 40, beetles again, then at lvl 51...beetles YET again, with goblins. Basically i think square rushed too much to make this game and didnt think to put in the monster variety that all the other FF titles have had."
3,Not a typical Final Fantasy game,"I bought this game because I love Final Fantasy games. I played the game for a month and thoroughly enjoyed it. But it is very different from most Final Fantasy games. First of all, it's a Massive Multi-player Online Game, which you have to pay a monthly subscription (the first month is free.) This makes the game amazingly complex and interactive, but I feel that it looses the story in the process. There is no linear story of good fighting evil. I like Final Fantasy X & X-2 so much because it was like watching/playing a movie, this game is nothing like that. It would be a good alternative to Everquest, and I think many people that play Final Fantasy games would like this game, just be warned that it is a completely different game."
1,final fatcity,"At first Final Fantasy XI online was fun, for about 2 weeks. Then you realized that all it was about was leveling up, and up, and up. Okay, you fought different monsters, used different weapons, fight with different groups but just to do the same thing the same way. More then half the time you spend online you spend waiting for a party, because after you reach a certain level, you depend on everyone all the time just to survive. You also need a super computer to run this game WITH lag and if you want it without lag, prepare to spend about $600 in computer parts.After our 30 day free trial was up, we canceled. They took the money out of our account two weeks later anyway and wouldn't refund it. So you decide...I think its bad, boring, and a ripoff."
1,Yep^,"ok you guys need to stop freaking complaining this is not a review this is a shut up post. I havent played the game but I am planning on it, but me unlike you are going to try it out before buying it to solve the stupidity of not liking it. You complain about crappy graphics, get a new video card noob. It says that you need a GeForce video card, if you dont know , your an idiot. So stop your guys complaining it aint gonna get you anywhere, you say all the final fantasies are boring like this one why buy this one if you think all the others are boring. Get a life."
1,"Sad, sad game......","Ok, if you've played Final Fantasy games before and you want to know what this one is like........Load up any other Final Fantasy game. Call over 2 of your friends that also like FF games. Everyone picks a character to be ""theirs."" When a battle starts, you only get to control ""your"" character. When it's someone else's turn, give the controller to them.""What if my friends can't come over and play?"" you ask. Well then you can't play either.""What if my friends are idiots and screw everything up?"" you ask. Then everything is going to be screwed up.""Even when everything is going well, this is only 1/3rd the fun of getting to play 3 characters."" you say. Yes, you are correct.And now you have figured it all out without paying $50(+whatever extras you might have bought). You're welcome."
2,horrible,You know how the producers talk about being in a party the whole time and over 1 mil people are playing...LIES. when i played FFXI i only saw at least 3 Real people not counting the useless NPCs. THis Game is the worst game i have played since Oregon Trail 1. Get Star Wars Galaxies.
3,"Fun, but gets old","Final Fantasy XI amazed me. The size of the game is enormous with thousands of people playing and numerous places to go. It is one of the most addicting games to play when you first buy it, but over time it gets boring. Hardly anything ever changes, and there's not a lot of action in it. But, for such a large game, the visuals are fantastic and it's great that you can create and personalize your own character. It has catchy music and creative events from time to time as well. It is fun, but since all you really do is level up your character, after awhile it just gets old."
3,"Some good, some bad","This game definitely has some good points, with a cohesive story line, good character development system and decent quests. Where it falls down is technically. The UI is cumbersome, the graphics are last generation and the patching mechanism (how online games get updates) is hit or miss.Will provide hours of entertainment if you can get past the weak spots."
4,AWESOME,"its just, WOW, i mean this whole video game world is awesome its so large that you could get lost in it, and the character making part is the best.i mean this game has some of the best graphics i have ever seen. square enix has really outdone itself on this game. the only reason im giving this game 4 stars is not for the game itself but for the monthly fee. i mean come on. i love final fantasy since the very first one but i cant afford to spend 12.50 a month to play this game. i'm telling you that this game is worth the money but for the people who dont make 12.50 a month its a real hassle. im telling you though if you love final fantasy and can afford the monthly fee then buy this game its totally worth it."
5,Dont buy USED....!!,"I will keep this short and to the point FF11 is an amazing game---BUT---within the box you purchase is a registration code to register you online to play the game(unique to each game box)if you but this item from a person who says they tried and did not like or could not use due to ANY reason(slow cpu etc...) then they have ALREADY registered this registration code and therefore the game will be 100% USELESS to you. Playonline.com's policy is very clear, they will NOT help you with this problem as (right on top and bottom of box) it says, and i quote ""not valid for purchase if opened. Not for resale by a prior owner."" this is on the box because if they have used at ALL, then u will NOT be able to play, and you WILL have to buy another copy of the game. So please beware and make sure, if you buy used, it claims UNOPENED in the item description."
5,THIS GAME RULES!,"Yes the game is a very long one ,but thats whats good about it,whats wrong with a long game?The amount of things that can be done on this game is amazing!truely the best game iv played on ever,i suppose FFX,FF8 + FF7 come close because they have more storyline,however the game doesnt need a storyline with all the people u can talk to.If your a FF fan this is the ultimate game!"
4,Eh...,"I played this for, like, five minutes at my friend's house.Pretty easy game to figure the controls out on, but it's NOTHING compared to Dark Age of Camelot. =P"
5,Troublesome istallation but Excellent Game Play,"Had Troublesome installation, but after contacting playonline over the phone the problems were solved. Excellent Gameplay, and the graphics are stellar. Still learning shortcut keys and commands, but its even great before Ive learned everything."
1,Monthly fee required,No where on this website does it tell you that you can't play the game without paying a $12.95 monthly fee.
1,short and sweet...don't waste your money,"I can't begin to describe how boring this game was. After sitting at home for 3 hours for all the install and updates I finally was able to play. I couldn't believe how dumb the controls were on the XBOX controller. We have microphones...and if you play games like call of duty 2 you can talk to different people, but not in this game. You have to scroll through a picture of a keyboard on the screen...it takes 1 minute to write your name. Just don't get it if you are not into games that have a really really deep storyline...100's of foreign names for everything, lots of walking and way too many controls. I played FF9 and absolutely loved it. Can't say that about this one. I am pretty bitter about spending the money on this game. Hope this review was helpful. I read a lot of positive reviews on this site and I am assuming those ones are from people who really are into intense, never-ending role playing games."
5,Incredible gaming experience,"I was also a member of the beta (IYO). FFXI is incredibly addictive fun! It's all about collaboration, meeting and playing with other players doing quests, missions, level parties, treasuring hunting and so much more! Battles are all in real-time. And, yes, while you tell your character to attack, you have special attacks, spells, and items that you must choose to use as things happen in the battle! You ""could"" sit there and do nothing as your character fights - but what fun would that be? The overall interface is very similar to everquest with enhancements like MAPS, and mission/quest tracking. I HIGHLY recommend this game! Oh, and the chocobos, character types (white mages, black mages), summons, crystals, and other signature Final Fantasy elements are all in here!"
4,Final Fantasy XI could of been better,Final Fantasy XI is an ok game. It has very well done cut scences and has outstanding graphics. However it's interface is a little hard to get use to. I have been playing online games for a while now and I have found that if you are lost the best way is really to ask for help. The person you ask will stop and help you. Final Fantasy did a great job with the combat and the quest system. I would suggest anyone whos is willing to pay the online game should consider buying it.
2,Pros and Cons of Final Fantasy XI you should know before deciding,"Pros -- Fans of the FF Empire will enjoy a more virtual world, as that of Final Fantasy XI Online. Deep story lines and nice graphics.Cons -- Gillsellers (RMTs: Real Money Traders) upset the balance of the game's economy making it hard for normal gamers to progress. Poor tech and game support."
1,Too bad it's so bad...,"Besides FF10, this FF is just the worst of the series. It's also a terrible MMORPG. If you want real MMORPG, check out Ultima Online. It is actually reasonable on the quests. As with FF11, you have to level up to extreme levels just to ride chocobos, etc. The quests are boring and tedius. This is not for MMORPG, it's not even really for hardcore FF fans. FF is better single player, and I suggest starting at FF6 (known as FF3 on snes) and work you way up."
1,Do not buy game used,"I bought this game on ebay and stated new. New as in the person did not play the game because you need a certain graphis card to run the game. So I bought the game, just bought the graphics card. And then when installing the game on playonline the registration code was invalid.. The reason was the person did not play the game but just to install the game he used a registration code just to install the game.. So I paid almost full price for a worthless game that I can't use. Gotta love that."
5,pricy! BUT EXTREMELY FUN!!!!,i think its pricy for the monthly fee i wish we only had to pay like 5 bucks b ut its fer a good reason nway the games really fun i play it at my friends house all the freakin tyme nd im getting an alienware computer soon so i can finally buy my own copy nway plz buy this very veru fun game
1,There are better role playing games,"Buyers be REAL Careful. You MUST have a NVidia GEForce card or an ATI Radeon 9000 card for the game to work at all! NO Other video configurations will work. Square Enix only programmed the PC version to run on this limited set of hardward. The game will stop and give the error that the hardware is not supported if you try to run using a different video. There is NO workaround. Note that you cannot install an NVidia or ATI card without an AGP slot which is only provided on the more expensive computers.Gameplay on any but the most expensive, fast, computer is SLOW and cumbersome. The sound breaks up and the keyboard does NOT react quickly which is what is needed when you are fighting. This was on a Pentium 4, 1.5 GHz system with and NVidia GEForce II card.The game does run OK on a 2.5 GHz machine with a GEFOrce 4 card. I wouldn't purchase the game if you own anything less.I would NOT recommend this PC version of the game."
1,BEST GAME EVER,I love this game! I play for about 12 hours a day. I play 18 hours on days I have off. Thank you god. I have now found my true calling in life.
2,Smells Horrible,"Although this product is probably effective for its intended purpose, it has a horrible smell.We have two miniature schnauzers and their beards inevitably pick up some of the oil. The smell is so strong that the dogs and the house reek hours after feeding. Immediately after feeding their breath is intolerable.The bottle is dated 4/11 so freshness is not an issue ... glad we didn't buy a larger bottle.We're now looking for a flaxseed oil product for pets ... same Omega-3, Omega-6, DHA and EPA benefits without the stench."
4,Alaskan Salmon Oil,My dog loves it and has not had any skin problems since I started using it. So I guess it is good.
5,good for our dog maggie,maggie had a lot of dandruff.. this product really helped her. . very happy with results from alaskan bear treats all natural wild alaskan salmon oil for dogs. frankie s.......p.s. also alittle goes a long way
4,Awesome product.. my dog smells like salmon though lol,I really liked using this product. It is really easy to use.. but the smell kinda is overwhelming. Otherwise my dogs coat is so nice now.. and its really helped with his dry skin!
5,"Great stuff, our dogs love it, coats and skin look great","We have three big dogs, two rottweiler mutt rescues and a white shepherd/yellow lab cross mutt rescue. Our blonde dog has always had skin/itching/hotspot problems, and we struggled to keep his skin healthy and him free from obsessive chewing. Two things in combination worked - first, regular flea treatments, and second, salmon oil with each meal. We've tried both separately and they don't work nearly as well, but when we do both (monthly flea treatment and daily salmon oil) he clears up and is free of hot spots and obsessive scratching/chewing.We also give it to our other dogs, and all three of them have beautiful, soft, shiny, healthy coats."
3,Omega-3 for dogs,I bought this for my new puppy so she could have an Omega 3 supplement. I don't see all the things that others have said but I know my dog loves the taste. I like the fact that its from Wild Salmon & rosemary extract. The 3 stars only because I don't know if its as great as others say it is. Its easy to pump and bottle does not leak.
5,Amazing!,This stuff is amazing! I have a 90 pound lab that was scratching like crazy all day and night. The vet told me he was allergic to oak and suggested benadryl. I was giving him 4 pills a day without much improvement other than it made him sleepy and he didn't scratch when he was asleep. I put 4 pumps on his food twice a day and he loves it. Licks the bowl clean. After 2 days I stopped the benadryl and after 3 days he stopped scratching. I usually take these reviews with a grain of salt but I have to admit I am a believer now! I'm hoping this will reduce the amount of shedding going on once his coat is stabilized as well. I notice a very feint odor but it goes away within 30 minutes or so and I'm guessing if you don't have a super sensitive nose you might not even smell it at all. Best money I've spent in a while!
3,"Fine, but a better choice would be switching to higher quality kibble","I bought one small bottle of this for my dog to see if it would help his itchy skin, and found that it added way too many calories to his food since you have to use so much. I cut back on his kibble to compensate, but I didn't want to withhold too much since oil doesn't really fill the belly. My dog is a 65 lb. active dog, but he still gained a couple pounds due to the addition of this oil, despite my cutting down his kibble.If you use this salmon oil in the prescribed amounts, it'll cost you an arm and leg, too. You might as well switch to a really high quality kibble, which can do just as much to improve the quality of your dog's coat.I did not notice that this salmon oil stopped my dog's itching but it did seem to make him shed less. Of course, he also really enjoyed the taste."
2,Broken Pump,"The pump was broken from the main container when I opened it from the box. Thank god I had a old container of the other brand wild grizzly salmon oil so I could which out pumps. This stuff smells and you dont want it to leak. If I dont see a difference in this product versus wild grizzly salmon oil, I will be going back to the grizzly product."
1,Terrible product and company,This product gave my dog terrible diarrhea that took 3 days to clear up. I emailed the company twice asking to take them up on their money back guarantee and received no response whatsoever. Do not buy this product! It may have helped other dogs but made my dog sick and I was ignored by the company. This is not the type of company that you want to do business with.
2,strong odor,"i find this oil to be strong smelling - as opposed to ""iceland pure salmon oil"" which is processed to remove impurities and smell! so if you don't like your kitchen to smell like fish after feeding the dogs, try iceland pure salmon oil instead. both oils will improve your dogs coat and general well being, but i don't care for fish odor."
2,90% of the Oil Leaked Before I Even Recieved I\t,The bottle came leaking so much the whole box was just soaked fish oil that made the hall smell for weeks and that I returned for a refund. I'm not able to review the product by how my dog liked it because of this. But I'm looking into other brands where the product will get to me in usable condition...
3,Might be working,"Ok, so we have been using this in my dogs food for about a year. I have seen major improvements in her coat. She had a good coat before, but now it's almost luxurious! No fishy stinky either."
5,Yellow labs owner,Great product. . has reduced the shedding significantly and dogs coats feel smooth and look healthier. The need for brushing them has lessened as well. Already placed second order. Really great. . . highly recommend.
4,Delicious,Hmm... what can I say... it already looks like everyone said everything.It took me weeks to see anything different. Their skin improved and they grown a tad more lush. My poms absolutely love anything stinky so this stuff is absolute heaven for them. What can I say. Its an ice cream sundae in a bottle for my two pooches.
2,Bad smell,I wish my dog would have liked the taste. I tried everything to get him to ingest it. i put it on his food and he refused to eat. then i got a medicine dropper and put it directly into his mouth. He started chocking and tried to get it out. i have a black lab who is 12 years old and i am sure it would have been great. i gave it to my son for his dogs and they wouldn't eat it either.
3,i expected better results..,"from reading previous reviews, i really thought this was going to change my dogs coat more. His skin is still really flaky, but he did seem to enjoy it on his food, i just don't know if it's worth the price for such ""lack luster"" results."
1,disappointed,"The phone does work. I had a lot of difficulty setting it up. I could not view all the instructions on the computer, configuration was off. I am not sure if that was my fault or not but I've never had problems before with other software. Every time you want to make a call you have to open up your skype contacts. Once I set it up I could not receive email.I eventually got bumped out and so I am going to buy another phone. I also tried contacting their support line. They tried to help but with the language barrier,they could not understand what I was trying to say and kept repeating the same instructions over & over. Useless for me. :("
4,Some strong songs,These musicians sing concrete lyrics with sincerity. Stillwater is outstanding and several other tunes will really grow on you.
2,"Worked great, then died","Bought this machine a year ago when my old frother quit working and was not replaceable. The Froth au Lait worked very well, lots of froth and great for hot chocolate but was always too large to keep out and tedious to clean. Last month it began acting up and I realized that the heating element was running too hot and burning the milk. So now it's trash. Guess we got our money's worth since it was used quite often but certainly expected it to last longer than 11 or 12 months. Won't buy another."
5,great product!,"I bought this frother to help me save money by not going to Starbucks every day. I am extremely pleased with it, and haven't been to Starbucks in several weeks! It froths great and in so little time! Easy clean-up, though I recommend buying a bottle brush to really get it thoroughly clean. It's a great product! If I could make one change to it, I'd say that I wish you coould buy a bigger version. My family of five all love it, so I need to make two containers full to be able to give all the kids their steamers while I'm having my drink. :)"
5,Great Frother!!!!,"I purchased the Froth au Lait last January after seeing it on the Today show. It makes thick froth that lasts. Before seeing this product on TV, I had tried the frothing sticks which didn't make great froth and would stop working after a few months of daily use (I love cappuccino), and had recently returned the Nespresso frother because it did not make good froth. I decided to try the Froth au Lait, but did not expect it to work since all the others had failed, but this machine is amazing. It quickly makes thick creamy froth in minutes. You do need to clean the carafe part after each use, but it does not take long and it is a small price to pay for perfect froth every time. My two cousins were teasing me for purchasing another kitchen gadget until I made them cappuccino and they were sold. I never have written a review, but I think this is a terrific product at a great price!"
4,froth away! but not for long....,"Have been using this for a week and learning what works and what doesn't. So far, use soy not rice milk. Don't put cocoa powder in 2% milk before frothing. The temperature is perfect for sipping when you're done. Use a measuring device for quantities. Soy Nog/Egg Nog and flavored soy beverages are really fun in this. Eating all that air can make you feel full! I'm loving it so far. Ridiculously simple to clean, but Don't Forget to Do So After Every Use! and do run cold water into it, let set a moment, between batches. Yummy fun.Froth Au Lait Frothing Unit, White or BlackAdditional info: stopped working before a year was up. Very hard to clean properly. sad. i loved what it did."
4,keeps on working!,"i bought our froth au lait 3 years ago, with a recommendation from friends. although it's plastic (not my favorite material) and it gets HEAVY use it continues to do a beautiful job of heating and frothing our milk every morning day after day! it can be a bit of a pain to clean, because the milk sticks and burns on the bottom. it is important to clean after each use or it will not work as effectively. i didn't expect it to last this long!"
5,Froth Au Lait,"We've had a Froth Au Lait for 9 years and loved it. We use it everyday and it makes wonderful milk froth for tea and coffee and the kids love the frothy hot chocolate. The company has wonderful customer service. Highly recommend it. It's the only frother you should ever buy.Froth Au Lait Frothing Unit, White or Black"
2,The ON button broke after 3 uses,"We liked this item but the fun only lasted a few days. The milk was very frothy and the kids loved seeing it in action. The downside was that the mechanism inside is complicated with many gears and paddles, was not easy to clean, and was surprisingly noisy. The main button that is supposed to stay down for 3 minutes stopped staying down after just 3 uses. We returned it after 1 week and will probably buy the Nespresso Aeroccino."
3,"Too... well, frothy?","My intended use for this item was making lattes along with a Bialetti Moka stovetop espresso maker (5 stars), but I found the result of the automatic cycle to be all froth and no steamed milk. After time, it condenses to a much smaller volume, which is fine unless you're keeping your drink in a bottle and not drinking immediately. If you keep your drink in a vacuum bottle to have through the day, the volume decreases substantially.Unless you're a chef, I think the value in this product just isn't there. You're better off with the hand frother from Aerocinno, which runs about $14.A minor note is that my first unit (from a third party) was defective and already smelled of old milk. Go with Amazon directly to be safe on this one."
1,"Looks good, tastes awful","Yes, this machine does make perfect froth, but unfortunately, since it is heating up milk in a plastic container, the froth tastes and smells like plastic."
1,disappointment,"After much consideration, I chose this over the Nespresso, because of the positive reviews. It is uglier in person than the picture depicts,(big, plastic), noisy, and takes too long to heat. The foam is not nice either. Back to the nespresso -- quiet, good foam, looks nicer on a counter, takes up less room, and you have the option to just heat the milk without the foam, if desired."
2,OK at first.,Does a great job at heating and frothing but it is very difficult to keep clean and was way too big on the counter. It broke eventually and I bought a different kind of frother.
4,Love the Froth! Need help cleaning,"This is a really great frother! It froths like no body's business :) but I'm unable to get it completely clean because I can't get into the rotating frother where the holes are in the middle of the long part and the sealant touching the heating element on the bottom seems to collect milk under it?!?! I add water and a little soap and run it through a cycle after each use, but still not sure about the inside of the frothing wand. If those don't get clean it will eventually make me sick."
5,Great product!,"This frother really whips it up! I've had other ones and this is by far the best! Hold more or less liquid, as you desire, and works great with any amount that is within the limits of its capacity."
1,My experience was not good.,"The Froth Au Lait unit is large, too large for my counter top. At my expense, I mailed it back to the company. They charged a $10 restocking fee. So, $10 to ship it to me originally, $12 to ship it back, and $10 restocking fee on a $49 item that has a much larger footprint than the picture would suggest, and nothing in the company literature about the restocking fee, adds up to a bad experience with this company, in my view. You may want to factor my experience into buying this product online."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this a few months ago and loved it until this morning. Set it up, turned it on, and nothing. This product should last longer than a few months.Purchase with caution unless you want to buy a new one every few months."
5,Tried many; this is the best!,"Hello,As far as I am concerned, there is no better product that I have purchased than the Froth au Lait. I have owned several over 6+ years and have bought several as gifts). Their customer service is outstanding--the inventor and owners of Froth au Lait care deeply about their products and running a business the right way--customers are their lifeblood and they know it!I have tried about 3 or 4 other frothing products--handheld (battery-operated) or French press type (in a glass container that can crack at high-heat) and the Froth au Lait is the best, richest foam w/non-fat milk. I have joked to many people that if I were on Survivor, this would be my ""luxury item"" (I guess I'd have to smuggle in the milk and coffee.....)Great company, great people, great products -- A++!"
4,cleaning tips,"This product is great when it works well, but the motor can get crudded up, and then it just heats up but doesn't spin, and the milk gets scalded and is hard to get off the bottom of the pitcher. I recommend soaking the pitcher with water and dishwasher detergent, or running the machine with dishwasher detergent and water."
3,Definite product life,"I truly think the Froth Au Lait is the best for frothing milk. We use it daily. The problems: I'm realizing there's a definite short shelve life. We're into our second FAL after the first one stopped whipping. A definite caution I would offer is make sure you thoroughly clean the container because the heating element ""burns"" the milk and leaves a burned milk stain. If you don't clean it, in time, the unit will stop working.We've had our second unit for one year, maintained it properly, but it no longer heats the milk. It whips up a silky textured milk that when added to your coffee and microwaved for 30 seconds, the froth reconstitutes into the normal light bubbly texture. However, this adds another frustrating step to making that first cup of coffee in the morning!I've rated only (3) *** because it seems to me that the product should last longer than one year if properly maintained. (Otherwise it would be 5 *****)"
4,"Froth Au Lait, Better than Nespresso","This machine is wonderful! It makes thick, warm froth as it heats the milk and then shuts off automatically. I use it to make Starbuck-style Vanilla Steamed Milk, or to add to coffee.For the Vanilla Steamer, I pour a couple of ounces of Torino Vanilla Flavoring through the hole in the top, and it is a complete drink once it shuts off---in about two minutes. Delicious! Everyone loves the mounds of froth in their coffee, along with the nice warm milk. The big difference between Nespresso and Froth au Lait is capacity. Nespresso only holds a couple of ounces of milk and Froth au Lait holds one and one half cups. One batch will make a big mug of steamed milk for me and plenty of warm milk and froth for my husband's coffee. Or you can pass the pitcher around to four or five coffee drinkers and there is plenty for everyone. Additionally, it is very easy to clean. A great new appliance for my kitchen."
4,great frother,received item in timely fashion. ok price. works great but you have to keep your eye on it so you dont over foam the milk or else it pours out. only downfall i would prefer the milk to get hotter
4,works great,"The froth au lait works great. I did not give it five stars because it is very loud. Also, it is supposed to automatically shut off in 3 minutes, but mine does not do that. But, it does warm and froth wonderfully."
5,Stress Free!,"If I close my eyes I swear I am back in Spain! Soothing, passionate guitar music guaranteed to transport your stress filled life to a vacation in your mind."
3,Cultural Anthropology,"I read this book for a cultural anthopology class. It was a very easy read which I enjoyed. As far as cultural anthropology, I found this book very interesting. It is amazing hoe different the culture and the health of the people are. She did talk about herse;f a lot but it would be difficult just to focus on your subjects when you are so far from home."
3,Dancing Skeletons,"This book is interesting but the author uses such a subjective approach to the ethnography that it loses much of its value anthropologically. I found myself constantly objecting to her inclusion of her feelings, likes, dislikes, etc. A good read for entertainment, but the science of it is only fair."
2,"Too subjective, aiming to shock, and little more","The author approaches an interesting subject, but the book contains fatal flaws. It is far too subjective, filled with the author's own disputable views. It also aims at shocking and surprising the reader, rather than informing about the subject. All in all, it is a book I really did not enjoy."
3,nice reflection on time spent in the field,"Dettwyler tells the story of her anthro work in Mali, and it is certainly an interesting read. But there is a tone throughout that is just kind of whiny. Definitely not an ethnography, although I'm not sure it was intended to be, but more of an account of what it is like to do work in rural villages. This is a nice easy read and should give some insight on village life in this part of west Africa, but the book shifts focus quite a bit and the author's tone grows a bit tiresome as the book goes on, but don't let that deter you if you are interested in this subject. Not great, but definitely worthwhile..."
4,Wonderful,"I am a college student and just finished reading this book for my Anthropology class. I feel it is very weel written and I learned many things I had no idea about from this book. Unlike a text book teaching you, Katherine is taking her audience on a ride through Africa with her. I recomend this book to everyone."
4,dancing with skelotons,"i had to purchase the book for an anthropology course. It was not something I thought I would like, but I really enjoyed it. I laughed, cried, and got angry. I would recommend reading it. it is definatly an eye openning book."
5,Amazing story,This book went from making me want to cry to making me laugh over and over again. It was a great book that was easy to write an essay on for my anthro class. Dettwyler is an inspiration
5,Twists and turns! A great new author of horror!,The cover of this book grabbed me and after the first few chapters I was hooked. Finished the book in just two sittings. The story flows easy and the characters are intriguing. This story will please gothic novel fans and horror fans alike. The ending is to die for! I will definitely look for more of this author's work!
5,Best horror of the year...,"Vacant Spaces didn't surprise me...it scared me! And that's what i look for in a horror novel. There are some truly creepy parts to this book. There were times that i would look up from its pages and forget where i was, i was really expecting to see the old brownstone, Mark Andrew Ware is so descriptive you become one with the characters and surroundings. If you really like horror novels that chill, then you'll love this book!"
4,Rustie's not rusty,"""Chip chip"" is a good, energetic, high-spirited album. Rustie is a spunky singer. The music overall has a traditional flavor, but still has appeal for those who are not hard-core traditional county fans. With 15 tracks, the album has decent length, the listener's not short-changed. Good effort, Rustie."
1,"It's a great movie, if you like 1920's special effects!","This movie was such a dissipointment, there is no difference between it and the origional, if you ask me the 1925 Lost World would be five stars compared to this! The T-rex looks like it was an iguana hoisted onto it's hind legs! This movie was a big dissipointment."
1,It's a great as Jurassic Park!... minus 1 million,"If anyone rates this movie 5 stars they must have a mental problem. These dinosaurs looked like they were just triangles and squares put together. Where have these people been latley everyone knows a T Rex doesn't look like a Lizard! Infact probably the only reason dinosaurs are in here is so that an oil company can kill them. Come on. The story line also has a serious problem. A group of explorers come to what is known as ""The lost world"" even though half the planet knows about it. Then the oil company disturbs a volcano and then some people die and a village gets saveed by the lava. BIG WHOOP! If just one building got burned that would be enough to get this up to 2 stars. So if you rent this video do the video store a favour and put it ina garbage despencer and through it in a fire pit. Infact they should have a ""Take at your own risk"" sign just for this movie."
5,The baseline tutorial for the art of the Americn School of Oboe,"This was first available as an LP album but thanks to Boston Records this has been transfered to the CD format.This is the nearest thing we have to a written explanation of how Tabuteau made his magic. My teacher Earnest Harrison passed these lessons on to me when I studied with him and to hear these lessons from the maestro himself reenforced the depth of understanding Earnest Harrison had from his training that Tabuteau passed on to him. This is still an aural teaching experience.For every oboist that wants to really be an artist this is the absolute baseline for attaining that goal.As my teacher told me, Robert there are a lot of good players too few artists. let this be the starting point of your musical experience.I highly recomend this recording."
3,Needs black magic to fix the plot,"Fans of Star Wars might be shocked to find their hero, Luke (Mark Hamil} play a dishonest playboy art gallery owner who is seduced by Cassandra,(Apolonia Kotero) a witch sent by his girlfriend's relatives to bring him good luck and a desire to marry Diane. Here lies the condradiction.Why does Cassandra only want to have him bitten by a snake and catch a deadly disease? Why does she in her jealousy want to murder anyone who could cure him? The relatives seemed be using witchcraft so he would want to marry Diane, yet they seem to be casting spells to kill him instead. Black Magic Woman seems to be a story to wrap around Carlos Santana's music. It's thin on plot sense, but very entertaining."
4,There Once Was a Very Odd School,"This clever rhyming book is full of delightful laughter and brings a new twist to sometimes monotonous school experiences. The book's bright and colorful illustration adds to the silliness that author Stephen Krensky depicts in his limericks. The focus of the book is on goofy things that kids often dream up, such as a never ending recess or the mystery food served in the cafeteria. This is a great book for adding humor to any classroom reading experience."
4,Good Book to Read Aloud,"There Once was a Very Odd School and Other Lunch Box Limericks is actually a really funny book that needs to be read aloud. The book is full of limericks that talk about school, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Some of the limericks are realistic, like the one about the shy boy at school who is only outspoken during guym. Others are very fictional, like the one about the teacher from another planet who turns students into statues. While the book is not organized in any particular way, the poems are still humorous and would be fun to read all at once, or individually."
5,community of hand and mind,"Reading the poems in CRAFT, I could not help but think of the WTO protests and those regarding China's entry into that organization. Loss of jobs and manufacturing bases, national security, child labor, pay priority: all valid concerns. But nowhere did I hear discussions of the nature of work, of making stuff, of using one's hands and what of that might be lost. Somewhere people will continue ro make things, and where that happens there will be a community of hand and mind--and, I think, community. At such a site will be Andrew Davis, pen and chisel at hand."
5,Excellant!!,This Mrs. Jeffries book is as usual very interesting. I have trouble putting this book down. It is just a who-done-it type of book with very interesting characters.
5,"Foot-Tapping, Finger-Snapping Piano!","I had never heard of Floyd Cramer until I tracked down the source of a music bridge I heard one morning on NPR -- it was a portion of ""Flip Flop and Bop,"" which remains my favorite cut on this CD because I love boogie woogie piano.With the exception of the theme from the TV show ""Dallas,"" the CD is a great addition to my collection of piano instrumentals. I know next to nothing about Floyd Cramer but I'm so very glad I discovered this CD."
5,Great Bible for Soldiers,"This is the second Soldiers' Bible I have purchased (the first was the New Testament only) and this is ideal for me as a Soldier in Iraq. The design of the Bible allows it to easily fit into a cargo pocket, the side closure helps to protect the pages, and if you slip it into a plastic bag its almost indestructible.In addition to the complete Bible (Holman Bible, which I feel is easier to understand than other translations) this Bible includes a topical index, the Code of Conduct, and testimonials from historically significant military leaders.This bible is a great utilitarian reference for those in uniform."
4,Great daily read,Great daily read. Really good way to start the day and get perspective. I recomend to any servicemember. 4 Stars.
3,Cheap,Not a good quality bible and has very cheap stamping on the front. But the words were still amazing. :)
4,Soldier's Bible,the bible is much smaller thatn it looks on line. It is too small for the case I bought. The bible looks like a nice bible. Its a gift so I hope he likes it.
2,Not one of her best...,"The best thing I can say about this book is that it's about Darkover. Other than that I found it over-long -- ponderous, in fact -- overloaded with explanation upon explanation about Darkover society that should be telegraphed by now as it is in the other Darkover books. Obvious in plot, syrupy, peopled with characters that take sudden questionable leaps of logic and emotion... It comes out as a bad romance novel that quits in mid-plot. Perhaps MZB is just so famous that her editors don't dare make suggestions any more? She can do much, much better than this. Go get The Shattered Chain or The Bloody Sun instead."
3,"A potential fresh start to Darkover, but needs ripening","So much happening, yet not enough of any one event to satisfy the reader. Subplots are inconsistently paced (the Ashara Alton subplot desparately needed development, and the death of Margaret's mentor took far too long); characters are inconsistently portrayed (especially the relationship between Regis and Danilo--at one point in her career, MZB wasn't afraid to make it clear they were lovers, but now it's extremely vague); and the ending screams ""Sequel in the works!"" The redeeming feature of the novel is that it's set after the Sharra Rebellion, in a period of which we haven't seen much (besides ""The World Wreckers,"" which takes place before ""Exile's Song""). I'm guardedly optimistic that ""Exile's Song"" will herald a new series of novels that will follow this storyline; I'm also hopeful that MZB will take a little more time with the next couple of novels and pace them more evenly"
3,Half a book is better than none,"The first half of this book was interesting, tight, suspenseful, and entertaining. The rest of it was, well, scattered. Conflict and plot points were introduced, only to be totally ignored by the so-called ""ending."" Perhaps the publisher was kicking and screaming for this one, and the author needed to finish it before it was actually finished. Still, visiting Darkover and so many of my old friends was quite pleasurable; and if MZB ever takes it into her mind to finish this novel, I will get my hands on that book as fast as I can"
1,This book is nowhere near the quality other darkover books.,"I practically grew up with Sharra's Exile as my favorite book, and I couldn't wait to read this, but its not worth the time. There is not a single original plot or thought in this book. It seems to be a mishmash of events in other darkover books, and even characters seem to be the same people over and over. I am done with the darkover books for good now- they are nothing but a disappointment. I can't comprehend how MZB could take something with such amazing possibilities and trash it! I wanted to tell the heroine of this book to shut up and stop complaining only a few chapters in. The only good parts contain Lew Alton, whom it seems the author can still write about in a quality manner. In general- yuk."
1,All Good Things End,"Sadly a lot of these ""after her death"" books were rough outlines and basically written by other authors notice the MZB and..such and such. Mind you they arent bad writers but they just are not her. Its hard to let go of a great writer but wouldnt it just be better to do the short stories or novels and not but her name on them if she wasnt involved in the process.This also goes for the Mists of Avalon series. Just let her go into the Mists and stop trying to bring her back. If you read her original stories you can peer into the world she was trying to show you."
1,The worst Darkover novel I've ever read,"Marion gives credit to a ""co-author,"" one of the Friends of Darkover writers, whose ""voice"" seems to me to be very strong in this book, as well as amateurish. I had great difficulty in forcing myself to read the first 100 pages, hoping that it would improve -- as it did, but not enough to make me think well of the book. The plot is contrived and the action forced; the character does not evolve but is squeezed into shape by the author. What was for me a great mark against the book -- and I don't want to be sued for libel -- but the book to me did not seem to ring true to Marion's writings in all her other Darkover books. I cannot recommend this book, even to die-hard fans (like me)"
3,GOOD,"I have read MANY,MANY books of MZB, but none of the Darkover Novels except for Exile's song. Being that I haven't read any other, there were no flaws I spotted like the different character ""Jeff"", or something, that everyone here has been saying there was a mistake made on?The book itself was interesting, though at points it went a little too slow, like during the threshold sickness thing.I gave this book a 6 because it was interesting and very good to read - but it could have been improved."
2,A little dissappointing...,"The book wasn't that bad...although a little overdone. The thing that upset me the most was that the whole Regis & Danilo relationship that was so carefully built before was shattered. Regis got married, and Danilo just gets to stand in the background, smiling? That bothered me so much, the rest of the book seemed dry. Although I would still reccomend it to others, especially those that haven't read Darkover before."
3,"A good songbook, but no longer complete","This was once THE John Denver songbook to have back in the day (1970s). It contains the following hits:Follow MeLeaving On A Jet PlanePoems, Prayers and PromisesRhymes And ReasonsSunshine On My ShouldersTake Me Home, Country Roads...and 17 other (lesser-known) songs by Denver.Obviously, later hits (e.g. Annie's Song; Calypso; Fly Away, For Baby (For Bobby); I'm Sorry; Looking for Space; Some Days Are Diamonds and Starwood In Aspen) are not included here.This book is out-of-print. You may be able to find it used if you are only looking for one or two of Denver's songs, or if you are on a budget.""John Denver Anthology"" [ISBN 0895249111] is a more complete and up-to-date collection of John Denver's songs and Amazon offers it at a great price."
5,Inexpensive and tasty Omega 3's!,"We all know that we need to get more Omega 3's. From heart health to brain health there is ample evidence that fish such as salmon, herring and sardines are very, very good for our health. The Polar Kippered snacks are consistently delicious, not too fishy with a light smokey flavor. I have these baby's on automatic delivery so I don't run out. I eat a can a day. Just drain the water and consume. You might try them on crackers or in a salad... but I gobble them up au natural! (I'm off all wheat products..). I get them for about a $1 a can... cheaper then my local super market. Every once in awhile I'll splurge on some relatively expensive sardines...but these are my daily staples! Highly recommended!"
1,UM........ NO,"Well I bought these, ended up giving to my dogs. Thee ..... aroma filled my apartment for a couple of days, mind you I threw out the can the same day I opened. There was a strong bite, bitterness to these.... from the smoking process maybe? Whatever it was it made these unedible for me. Now if you like seriously strong flavored smoked fish then this is for you."
5,Good Purchase,"A German friend of mine suggested I try these and I am glad I did. Tastes kind of like smoked bacon but not as fatty or greasy. I was pleased to see the expiration date on the tins was four and a half years from the date they arrived at my door. Very fresh, very tasty!Unlike some of my other canned food purchases from Amazon, these tins arrived in perfect condition. I will be buying this 18 pack again."
5,"If you haven't tried these Kipper Snacks, you must!",These are the best Kipper Snacks! I used to be able to find them in my local grocery store but suddenly they are no longer available. Great product. Nutritious light dinner served with chopped onions and tomatoes on my favorite cracker. Yummmm...
4,Tasty...but,"These kipper snacks are very tasty and worth the money...but, the nutrition label shows a serving size as a half a can. So if you ate the whole can at one sitting (and who doesn't?!) you get 20% of your ""daily requirements"" of sodium! That's a little harsh! And the North Seas have some bad pollution issues...are these fish taken from those waters? I wonder... (I only gave it 4 stars because of the nutrition label, as other kipper snacks I've bought list a serving size as a whole can and they were all of the same weight.)"
3,Adequate,Amazon shipped this rapidly and the product arrived in good conditionPro:The kippers are tasty.Good value for moneyConsKippers are smallThe kippers are packaged with a lot of water.The total amount of fish is less than from similar but higher priced products at Amazon
5,"I Like These, and will continue buying!!","I'll be honest. Originally, I was looking to buy a different brand name of Kipper Snacks, but it was not available at the time. So by purchasing the Polar Kippers instead, ended up being a better choice for me. In fact my Dad enjoys them as well! They have a great texture and natural smoked flavor that I enjoy eating with Saltine Crackers, or just right out of the can!. I will definitely continue buying these!~ :-)"
5,Great snack,"I first started buying these at the local grocery store, where they retail for about $[...] a tin. For me, buying them in bulk on here is a good deal, because I go through a few tins per week.These are a great high-protein snack, relatively low in salt and high in Omega-3 acids. Combine them with some good whole wheat crackers and a little spicy mustard and enjoy. They are nice and smoky flavored, de-boned, and packed in their own juices.Chances are if you're shopping for these things in bulk online, you've already had them before so writing too detailed a review is sort of pointless. They're a bit of an acquired taste, very strong in flavor, and not for everyone. Shipping was fast and efficient and best of all, free. Can't beat that.But for those who appreciate a good smoked kipper, you can't go wrong with these. Highly recommended."
2,Wingspan Copper Bath with Iron Stand,"When I was finally done assembling this bird bath, I thought the finished product was very nice and will look great in almost any garden. Unfortunately, assembly was the problem. The one I received did not come with any hardware or instructions and none of the drilled and tapped holes in the base matched (all 3 of the legs had holes in different places). I have access to a wire feed and I just welded mine together and repainted it with no problems. The reason for this review is to forewarn anyone who is not handy at fixing things or if you expect something to be perfect when you open the box!"
2,HURTS MY EYES,"WHEN I PUT IT ON, IT DRIES AND FLECKS FLY INTO MY EYES AND IT HURTS VERY BAD! I WOULD USE TARTE INSTEAD, THIS IS NOT AS INTENSE OF A COLOR AND IT FLECKS OFF."
3,"Nice, but...","I really wanted to love this product. It goes on smooth and creamy but I have doubts about its staying power. It seems to flake away easily unless you put on 3 or 4 layers. Anyone have tips on how to make this stuff stay on all day? I do put on eye shadow primer first, but it doesn't seem to help."
2,Dries out quickly!!,"This eyeliner started off great. Looked beautiful and was very easy to apply....however, after only about a month or two it dried out. Now it is very difficult to apply. I actually bought this product in 3 different colors and all 3 did the same thing - dried out! Now I'm stuck with 3 pot eyeliners that are hard to apply because it's so dry and doesn't stick to my eyeliner brush. Overall, do NOT buy this product. Buy the Makeup Forever brand!"
1,Dried Out in 5 days!,"I was so dissapointed with this smudge pot! It was about five days after I bought the product that the whole pot dried out. At first it went on really smooth but after it dried out it turned into a chalky mess that flaked off so easily! I tried to take out the dry eyeliner on top and get to a more smooth liner on the bottom but the whole thing was just a big mess. Even when it went on smooth after I first purchased it, I had to put matte black eyeshadow over the liner to make the shade darker. Don't waste your money. Try MAC Fluid Line or Clinique Brush On Liner instead."
3,alright,"I don't know if I just don't know how to put it on, or it just goes on to thick, sorry I couldn't help more."
3,way to bright for my skin tone (for in kitten),when i bought this thinking just the right thing then i tried it on when i got how its been in my caboodle for weeks the i got an idea after making fail youtube tutorial i spread this like a rough face mask and get my clerasonic and wash it off leaving a sparklying effect which last roughly 2 days
4,Very good quality!,"Good quality product. Ships ready to use with no assembly required. It is more pricey than some ""put together"" stools that look similar but it is comfortable and solid. I would give it 5 stars if the price point was a little better."
5,Perfect for My Purpose,"I am a choral conductor and am having medical problems, so I got this stool for rehearsals. It's sturdy and comfortable, allowing me to sit for over two hours without getting tired. I paid $42 and change (with free shipping), and it's well worth that price. The price seems to change daily on Amazon and lately has ranged between $70 and $98. I'd say that if it gets below $60 (with free shipping) and you have a use for it, go for it."
5,great stool,The stools are as nice as other reviewers have indicated. They are a nice look and are of a nice quality. They are very sturdy and stable.
2,Very Low Quality for such a High Price,"First off this is not a case, it is a pouch with a clear plastic front and draw strings at the top. Once in the case the controls are not that responsive because they are touchpads. Also it is such a tight fit that it is hard to get the player in and out of it and I feared scratching the display. The fit is so tight that after about a week the stiching holding the clear plastic in place began to come apart and in about another week there was a noticeable hole between the stiching and the clear plastic. Very low quality for the price.I love my Creative Zen Micro Photo, but hate the fact that accessories are so limited for it."
2,Downside.,"I bought this thinking it was a redo of the one so long ago. The one I remember only had four songs on it: Bear Necessities, Trust In Me, The Elephant March, and I Wanna Be Like You. Bear Necessities was an extra long song, and Trust In Me was this nightclubbish, jazz piece that was more provocative than done in the movie. Basically, it was the songs done in a serious manner. Or an attempt to do them in a serious manner. The current soundtrack is good and rather informative, but I felt cheated and that I had wasted ten bucks."
2,OK in a pinch,The iron is OK when you have no way to use a standard size - it sure beats no iron at all - be sure and use it on steam - has to have heat all the way on high to be of any use - i bought it to take on the cruise ship because all my summer clothes are cotton and wrinkle - travels well in luggage - nice looking product - nice long cord
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the Conair iron. That's not what I received from the shipper. When I tried to contact the shipper, I discovered that their website was just a blank page. When I called their toll-free number, I was on hold for 16 minutes before a recording came on and said, ""Our offices are now closed."" Now I'm stuck with a product I didn't order and can't return. What a terrible experience."
4,Pleasent scent...,"I like this perfume a lot, I just wish it would last a little longer. Seems that I don't smell it after a few hours..."
3,Something new,"My husband likes musky scents and I don't. I like citrus scents and mild floral scents (estee lauder pleasures, cool waters, apple dkny, hermes, tiffany, clinique happy). I was hesitant buying this perfume but since my husband likes musky scent I decided to give it a try. It has a very light musky scent that seems to blend nicely with the floral scents. It has a very light casual scent which i like. Not too overwhelming. It's ok ... Something new for me."
5,Nice clean and fresh scent that lasts all day,I love this parfume and buy it all the time...very nice light scent not over powering or too flowery....I love it and will buy it again and again.
5,It's a KEEPER!!,I've been using SHI for over 5 or more years now & I never get tired of the scent. I get compliments ALL the time from men & women!! It's great for work & also a night out in the town..if you love soft scents that last through out the day then this is the one for you...I usually buy a few bottles & place them in the fridge so they keep freash & crisp it also helps them last much longer then keeping them at room temp...at this price why not!...Enjoy..;)0
4,Shi,Another great value for the size of the bottle of perfume. I was happy to find it because it is hard to find in stores anymore.
3,Okey dokey,A little too sweet and feminine for me and I am going to give it as a gift to someone coz. it is a lil sweet for me but definitely some ultra feminine types would love this product.
5,Shi By Alfred Sung For Women,"The frangrance reminds me of Bath and Body Works Moonlight Path. However, the scent lasts much longer! It's great as an evening perfume."
5,Smells great,"My wife loves this perfume, and gets it over and over. That is about all that needs to be said. I bought it for her as a gift."
2,Shi,Product does not seem as long lasting and as strong as same item purchesed in major department store
2,Not something I would want to wear,I got this perfume and the top had broken during shipment and it leaked out a little. I didn't like the smell of it very much anyway. I've worn it about a week and haven't touched it since. It smells cheap to me (it was cheap hah) it doesn't make me go crazy to smell it more and more like perfumes I like. I think I will end up using this for a restroom deodorizer or something.
5,#1 Quality of Service,"The price of the product was the best I have ever found. The speed at which it was recieved was 2 days. So I was very worried about what I would recieve, but it was brand new in the box. I would rate this purchase and service the best I have ever delt with. I recommended it to all my friends. I give it 5 stars out of 5 stars and will use Amazon again for sure."
3,"Good price, bad picture.","The Sony 2.5 in. Handheld Color TV (FDL-252T) isn't a terrible buy. The price is good, and the screen is not that small. Yet, there are many bad qualities to the TV.Pros: Good 2.5 inch screen, nice sleek design,and good price.Cons: Bad sound quality, hard to get good picturereception, and it doesn't come with a case or adapter.All in all this product isn't one of sony's best, but it fits most needs."
4,Still working,Cordless phone battery and it's still working that is a good sign. I like it when I buy a replacement repair item and I forget that I got it because there were no issue that stuck in my mind.
2,Its not the right size... the add needs more especification o guidance so somebody else would not make the same mistake I did,"I needed a set of batteries with the same especification (3.6V 800mAh) but with size equal with those of a set of three AAA battery, the ones I get ar more like AA sized set of three batteries. Bomer!"
5,Works as advertised,"Granted I have only had it a few weeks, but the battery took its charge and has been working as hoped since its instillation. No complaints so far."
3,An Overview of BBS,"I use the book for my course in Behavioral safety at Western Michigan University, and I recommend it. Strengths: broad coverage of issues invoved in BBS; examples of it practice; some coverage of scientific principles behind the techniques. Weaknesses: It could be organized to make it more user-friendly; written at a rather advanced level; not a very good ""how-to"" book (T. McSween's ""The Values-Based Safety Process"" book is better at ""how to"" - I also use that one.)"
4,Sky,The first studio album from this fantastic group. I already have this on vinyl but wanted to update to CD before you can no longer obtain these albums. Sky was a flash of brilliance brought about by the quality of the musicians that made it what it was. Sky burnt so brightly for what was sadly only a short period of time. Lovely album.
5,Great Music by Great Musicians,"This CD is to replace my vinyl album and I have loved this music for 25 years. John Williams is one of my two favorite classical guitarists and Tristan Frye is one of the great percussionists; the other musicians are up to the task. I wish that this group had made more recordings, but I will continue to enjoy what they offered."
1,Disappointed but finally a solution,"This was always failing with errors, and finally I sent it back RMA to seagate. They sent me a new one, same model, but the bottom interface plate was a bit different.I tried it both usb and esata, and problems continued.Realizing I was not going to get it to work, I removed the drive from the housing and mounted it internally in my computer. Since then NO PROBLEMS and running fine.The drive is a sata interface one and I only needed to buy a sata cable to install.HOPEFULLY Seagate has fixed this and the newer models do not have the problem. This is now showing on the Seagate website as the ""Classic"" drive and is no longer available.Now Leary of SEAGATE products."
3,"Decent, but a bit slow for DVR recording.","This drive works wonderfully with DVRs which accpet USB2 external storage devices; just connect to your PC after downloadung the amazingly large 120MB Seagate Tools archive, then disable sleep mode.It has worked well for my Moxi, but when recording multiple streams, or HD streams, it can stutter and cause minor audio glitches. If this is what you'd use it for, get a different model with at least a 16MB buffer."
1,Junk,"If you're fortunate, you'll get one that works properly out of the box.If you're don't, you're doomed to Seagate No Support in Hades.Or if you're lucky, your retailer will take it back. But it seems silly to ship an entire drive back to Seagate and wait on a return drive that may or may not work -- just because a working drive had a bad module.The modules in the base of these units have exceptionally poor quality control. Seagate knows it and has done nothing about it. I've had several of these and all of them had one or both modules bad. In the case of both modules dead, it could be the entire thing was DOA.I've been a long time Seagate user and this drive is the biggest and only disappointment. It's junk. Pretty junk. But junk."
2,"Cute, but not well made","We are huge Razorback fans, so of course this was a must-have for our 12 month old son when riding in the car. Much to my disappointment, It lasted all of 5 days! Yes, my son did grab it a few times, but def not hard enough to break it or cause it to malfunction. It was just much more cheaply made than I expected it to be. But GO HOGS!!!!"
5,A heartwarming and uplifting film,"The Joy Luck Club is a wonderful movie about hope, coming to peace with past mistakes and regrets, and about family ties. This film touches at the heart of the most basic hope of parents--that their children will exceed them and have happier lives than they did. Excellent acting, direction and casting."
4,"Bad white man, bad!",My wife is Chinese and made me buy this movie. Then she made me watch it with her.
2,The Joyless Club,"I thought this movie was incredibly cheesy. So cheesy that when you put it between two slices of bread you could make a cheese sandwich. For instance, the mothers' stories, some of them seem too tragic to be true, I mean it just happens that in the club all 4 of the mothers(older women)coincidently all had tragedies in their earlier lives. Wasn't there one woman who had anything good to say? I think that this movie tried too hard to make people cry by making the stories so tragic and heartbreaking. Talk about sissy stuff. Some of the lines said by the mothers were incredibly cheesy, I can't recall them, but I know that they are a little bit overly done. In general I just don't like it. Every time I watch it, it gets cheesier and cheesier, I think I'll make myself a cheese sandwich now. All this talk about The Joyless Club is making me hungry."
1,Pathetic,"Obviously, Wang hasn't seen enough Chinese movies to know how poor the stereotyping is happening here. It's so sad I'd die in shame if this is how Chinese people in general are. Even my mother tell more honest story than this. The part about life in China was SO BAD.If you really want to know Chinese people and Chinese parents, try ""To Live"" from Zhang Yimou."
1,Wrong Region,"I was never able to watch this DVD because it continued to say,""Wrong region"" and ""Incorrect disc."" A coworker said that means it was formatted for another country. Well, shouldn't that be mentioned in the ad? Shouldn't a version that will play in the US? I was saddened as I know this to be an exceptional movie."
5,A Story that understands women,"Joy Luck Club is a story about women: mothers and daughters, wives and lovers, mother and daughter in-lawas.The characters are rich and full of flaws as well as strengths.More, the storyline is truly interesting and engrossing. The relationship between each other and each friend rings true and ironic as only real life can be.I loved when Waverly told her mother how unfair it was that she had so much power over her.Mothers of teenagers and adults forget that no matter how old our children get, not only will they always remain our ""babies""...we will always be their first love and their first shelter against the world."
4,joy luck club,Great movie. New in package and brought back all the great memories from when I saw it last time. Great buy
4,Amazing,This book is about the lives of Chinese women immigrants and their first-generation American daughters. We learn what it means to be Chinese through the eyes of both the mothers and the daughters. From each different perspective the reader learns how their lives have shaped how they think and view the world. When I read from the perspective of the daughters I felt like stomping my feet and screaming like a teenager over how their mothers treated them. Later when I read from the mother's perspective I was ashamed and also heart broken. I loved learning more details about the Chinese culture and experiencing the heartache that came with seeing the next generation lose some of that culture. This is an amazing read!
4,"Wonderful movie, overall faithful to the book","I saw this movie ages ago before I read the book. After reading the book, I watched the movie again. While the movie doesn't follow the book one hundred percent, the movie captures the spirit of the book well, so I can't really complain about the changes here. There were two changes that did bother me - in the book, something different happens to Ying-ying's son, but in the movie, what happens to Ying-ying in the past is more dramatic and has a greater effect than what happened in the book, so this is a change I can't really complain about. The other change is the ending. Overall it remains much the same, but in the book, the ending is longer and more extended, and I wish they could have shown a bit more of the book's ending. Overall a good film, if you liked the book, you should like this."
1,/Sigh,"The words 'region 2' meant nothing to me when I ordered this. So I get it and attempt to play it and I receive an error. Also, I cannot play it on my computer without changing the region, which I can only do 4 times no matter what. I read some of the reviews for this and I saw no mention of the fact that people in the U.S. cannot view it. So I have wasted my money and will have to go through the process of returning. I wish the seller had been more clear about this."
2,bad luck,"I was so stupid to buy a DVD in America. It appears that I just can play it on my computer, which was not what I wanted to do. I wanted to share the movie with my students. Impossible. Bad luck. Though it's a good movie!"
1,Ug.,"OK, I can't speak for all you chick-flick lovin' people out there, but if you're anything like me, this movie sucks. It is impossible to keep up with eight story lines, most of which are very boring, and the whole movie is really depressing."
2,A Fake Story,"The film opens with a fake story about a duck that wants to be a swan, and says, you see this, this is what it means to have Chineseness. Uh, all we Chinese do to ducks or swans is eat them. Then, there's the idea that a ""woman's worth is measured by the loudness of her husband's belch."" You won't find anything in Chinese culture or literature about Chinese males measuring the worth of women by how well they feed them. If you want the facts on Chinese people, you won't find it in this movie. I recommend you guys see SEVEN SAMURAI by the great Akira Kurosawa who knew the Chinese Heroic Tradition well."
3,The book was much better!,"I loved this book when I read it. The movie had less appeal. I watched it with some people who had not read the book first. They found the plot and the characters confusing. The movie skips quickly from mother to daughter, present to past, and from one mother/daughter set to another. For people who didn't read the book, this can become a little confusing. That said, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to Amy Tan fans."
3,The Joy Luck Club,The plastic cover was torn. The DVD was without scratches.This is one of my favorite movies.need three words to complete
4,Almost Perfect pt. 2: story within a story.,"As I watched ""Joy Luck Club"" for a third time, it occurred to me to wonder... we see the three other ladies explaining some aspect of their life stories to their daughters (or having it explained posthumously), but there is no such scene for Ying Ying. I have since found that this omission was deliberate. Author Amy Tan was very much in control of this film, and she made the decision to cut France Nuyen's best scene, in which she reveals the tragedy of her son's death to her daughter. Nuyen is extremely bitter about this. Apparently Tan wanted only unknowns in the film and was worried that Nuyen's presence might take away from the others. I would like to see a Director's Cut with that scene reinstated."
1,Depressing Stereotyping,"Someone actually described this film as presenting ""eight totally unique stories"". Actually, it's the same story again and again, drearily repeated: good Chinese woman abused by horrible Chinese man. I cannot believe anyone's vision was ever limited enough to produce a film in which one character after another is presented as such a caricature."
2,Suck Joy Club,"Wanting to understand Chinese culture more in-depth was hoping I would gain some effemeral insight with this film, albeit dated. What a pos... I did not read the book but the film is a complete whine fest and a suprreme showcase of how spineless Chinese woman are and there is no way I believe that. Everytime I heard the 'reverie' music which was the prelude to some sorry tale that attempted to wrench viewers hearts and align sympathy, I cringed. Asian women age well and are very poised, wonder what they think of American women, resilient, tolerant, forgiving, open, strong, anything useful gained from immigrating here??? Would love to hear some feedback on better avenues of education, this attempt was deplorable."
1,Not the reality,"The movie depicted the Asian man as a guy who always wants the wife to pay half of the money. In reality, I see more women trying to use men's hoping to be a gentleman to make him pay for this and that, and to get away with things she did that was bad.Another thing is that the movie depicted Asian men as bad guys. But in reality, I found that Asian men tend to be the ""nice guys"". And in fact, too nice that it became ""nice guys finish last"".So this movie just uglify Asian Men. The truth is, if you want to uglify anything, you can successfully do it. If you uglify with humor, at least people know it is just for making fun of somebody. If you uglify and make it look like a reality, then it is not so good."
2,Somebody Please Smile!,"I am under the impression that many people find this movie uplifting. I wanted to stick my head in the oven. The cast is impressive, but this movie is one long downer. Everyone seems to have a great deal of money, all the characters are beautiful, but all the women are soulful and in a great deal of pain and all the men are cardboard cutouts full of malice and stupidity. I have not read the book, but can only hope for the sake of the millions that bought it that it is much, much better than this."
5,One of the Best!,The Joy Luck Club is such a great find. A chic flic! This movies leaves you crying and smiling and engulfed in thesse womens lifes. Worth sitting down and watching. Great rainy day movie.
5,It changed me forever...10 stars!,"The Joy Luck Club was over looked for an Academy Award the year it was released. The Academy REALLY dropped-the-ball on this one. My friend's and I agree, Joy Luck Club is simply one of the best family-based movie ever made! The story line grips you until the very end. Sit down with your family and open your souls to great film making. Thank you Oliver Stone."
3,Replay?,"If you enjoy reading about sex, cheating spouses, drug abusers, a cast of characters with no depth and a plot that just doesn't add up, then this is the novel for you. If you're like me, you will not enjoy this novel as much as the first Hollywood Wives, there is not much of anything here to enjoy. I just couldn't get a feel for any of the characters. It's amazing how Ms. Collins ties up the story in a neat little package when in fact the story just doesn't make any sense. I've been reading Ms. Collins' work for a long time and this has been the most lacking one to date --- but decide for yourselves!!!"
4,Put yourself in their shoes!,"This is the first Jackie Collins book that I have read in at least 5 years. It has been a long time and I can see what I have been missing. It was a quick, easy read and even though there is a little bit over 500 pages, I polished it off very quickly. I devoured the juicy details of the Hollywood lives that are depicted in this book. It was a definite page turner and I felt that Collins really brought the characters to life. At first, I was a little bit unsure if I would like the characters. But after awhile I felt myself sympathizing with almost all of them in some form or another. I am generally not attracted to this genre, but I must say that Jackie is a winner. I am once again hooked by her writing style and can't wait to reread the first one. This book will take you to LA behind the scences and take you to places that you usually only see in the movies!"
5,"""The Story of Hollywood Told By The Only Lady Who Can Tell It""","After Jackie Collin's huge success of ""Hollywood Wives"" in 1983 she decided to write another book with the ""Hollywood Wives"" title in it called simply ""Hollywood Wives-The New Generation"". This book is not a sequel to the original, but instead features a complete different cast of characters who are sexy, ambitious and every bit as devious as some of Jackie's earlier characters with L.A. as the backdrop. This book is filled to the brim with sex and glamour, all ingredients that make for a wonderful Collin's book.The three main characters are Lissa, Nicci and Taylor who are all embroiled in their own troubles and interact with one another as a psychopath lingers in the background.""Hollywood Wives-The New generation"" was made into a mini-series starring Farrah Fawcett, one of her last acting gigs."
3,JUST LIKE THE OTHER'S,"THIS BOOK is very much like her other 30 or so books, movie stars, affairs, kidnappings, and a deranged person. I was very disappointed because I thought she could have come up with some newer ideas. Do not get me wrong it is fun to read but JACKIE please find some newer things to write about or at least reveal who these people are in real life, maybe then we can appreciate it more."
2,My fall into nostalgia,"When I was in 8th grade, I picked up Jackie Collin's Lucky and devoured it in 2 sittings. It was fast paced, sexy, and fun. 25 years later, I thought it might be fun to read her again for some summer fun. Sadly, I have to report that this is one of the WORST novels I have ever read. The plot is entirely silly. Despite being English, the author's command of the English language is dubious at best. But the worst part of all is that this novel is not FUN. And that's what it should be. Her characters are so one dimensional/stereotypical that I have more compassion for Dick... in the See Dick Run series. Even the sex scenes, of which there are few, are boring. The only bright side which is why I've rated the novel a star over 1 is the blind items she scatters throughout the novel. For a light, sexy, fun summer read look elsewhere... and if you like blind items, try the online gossip columns. But leave this novel on the shelf."
2,Not worth the read!,"One of the reasons I've found Jackie Collins to be such an enjoyable author is that she creates memorable characters. Her novels, usually are loaded with characters that you'd like to know and those that you'd like to take down a few pegs.Not so the case with HOLLYWOOD WIVES-THE NEXT GENERATION. The characters are boring, predictable, shallow, and totally not Jackie Collins.Don't waste your money or your time."
2,Loose ends left untied,"This book wasn't the least bit as entertaning as the first ""Hollywood Wives."" This time around the psychopath who's out to get the protagonist, Lissa Roman, lacks a motive. The horrific and terrible event from Lissa's past that is briefly mentioned is never once confirmed or brought up again. The characters aren't likable. But this book is an easy read. Die hard fans of J.C. will love it regardless of the obvious flaws."
3,"I didn't like Valley of the Dolls either, so . . .","Tripe- more of the same- ho hum . . . Maybe it's just me, but I need a plot you can sink your teeth into. Everyone who does Hollywood trying to be scandalous only seems to get to mundane. Maybe it's time for a wholesome Tinsel Town tale... If you want to shock people with depravity, then do it like Thorne Peters did in his novel Hollywoodland Kingpin and go all the way... If you want to go inside Hollywood through the back door, do it like Glen Davis Gold in Carter Beats Back the Devil. This is just Liz Smith gossipy- vapid and run on. The sexuality is two-dimensional and perfunctory. The plotline is obvious and worn. Hey Jackie, it's time to lend your immense writing skills to a new town. There are philandering wives in Kalamazoo you know..."
5,A Sizzling Summer Read,If you thought the summer was hot enough for you then you better read Jackie Collins new book. It will put you on fire!!Great Storyline and an amazing assortment of people that you can identify with. Once again youll enjoy every word of this book. A word of warning make sure you read this book in front of a high powered fan or else you'll burnup.A real page turner!!
3,Fun album to own,"Jerry Reed is one awesome guitarist, and so many of his songs (""U.S. Male,"" ""Eastbound and Down,"" ""Lord, Mr. Ford,"" etc.) are jumpy, fun tunes to own. This CD has a lot of good music in it."
4,"great shoes, just be careful","These shoes are gorgeous and I am very happy with them on the whole, just be careful when you first get them. I wore them on a night out with my family the day they came and when I got home, I noticed that the backs of my ankles were tender and, upon inspection, found that it had actually rubbed off some of my skin. (For the record, I was wearing good socks and I did *not* have them laced to tightly.)So, if you do indeed decide to purchase these, that's great -- I just suggest that you pick up a pair of heel liners first (I found dr scholl's to be very strong and reliable) so that they don't irritate the backs of your ankles. There's no need to suffer if you don't have to!Other than that little detail, I would have given 5 stars and am glad that I bought them and can dress them up or down -- a fine characteristic of Dr. Martens in the first place."
2,Looked great but really uncomfortable,"I bought these because they are an iconic look and high quality construction. This is the last pair I'd buy. After 6 months of walking in them and thinking ""gosh, I thought they'd be more comfortable, but I guess I just don't know"", and countless blisters on the back from the relatively thin material with no padding in the back, I decided to go for a pair of RedWings.Wow, I'll never go back. The RedWings look nearly as good but boyyyyyyyyyyy are they more comfortable. Not even in the same ballpark. I've got a 3 year old pair of wings that I've worn every day at work and the soles are starting to wear through, and they're still a lot more comfortable than the Docs ever were..."
1,TOTALLY AGREE NOT DOC MARTIN,I had a pair of Doc Martins they lasted me for 3 years they were so comfortable and durable. I needed a pair of steel toe shoes for work so I decided to give them a try they were the worst pair of shoes I've ever had. They blistered my feet and they didnt even last a year. I don't know if Doc Martin just went to a lower quality or what but please don't waste your time on these shoes. Check some of the other shoes with better ratings.
2,"An OK fan, but squeaks really bad.","The fan is not bad, it blows cool enough if you have it sitting right next to you, and the noise from the motor and blades doesn't seem too much more than other fans. But why I can't honestly recommend it and the reason it gets 2 stars is because of the squeaking. I've already tried WD-40 and the fan still makes terrible squeaking sounds when its on oscillation. No matter how long I leave it on, the sound only gets worse. I'm able to sleep through it because I'm a very heavy sleeper, but its when I'm awake that's the problem. It could just be a defective one, but if you get one like this it may drive you insane."
2,Blizzard Adjustable Table Fan,Cheap and loud is the best I can say about this fan. I consider it to be a total waste of money.
2,eeehhh,"I bought this fan for work. I work in an office that is always warm. The fan output is nice but the fan is loud and annoying. If you are close to others it may be too loud. The fan tilt doesn't always stay up either. I am always pushing the fan head back up every day when I get in to work. So in other words, buy a different fan."
1,Not so FANtastic,"Purchased this fan back on July 2, 2012, and it stopped working Sept 13 2012. Attractive little fan but a waste of $$$."
5,Powerful little fan...,"I have been using this powerful little fan every day for over 3 years, and it's still going strong. I like the two settings and find it easy to operate. I get really hot after showering and use this fan while I am blow drying my hair and applying make-up. It keeps me cool. I would highly recommend this powerful little fan."
3,"Strong, but a little noisy and difficult operation","This fan is very strong, even on the low setting, for a relatively small table fan. In fact, it's probably too strong if you just want a breeze on your face. I use this in my workspace and have to be careful about papers flying around and the noise disturbing my neighbors (no complaints yet...). My biggest complaint is the operating control, which is a dial on the back of the fan unit. It's not very convenient and somewhat difficult to operate (don't even try if you have arthritis). I guess that keeps the cost down, not having the switch on the base unit. I think I'd rather pay a few extra bucks for the convenience next time."
3,Lil' Noisy,"The fan is cute, not super-cheap feeling for the price, and puts out an okay amount of air for its size, but it could definitely be quieter. High is loud, and low is less-loud. There is no rattling noise; it's all motor noise. They should up the price by a few bucks and throw in a quieter motor and three speed settings. I'd send it back if I thought it was worth the effort. I think I'll throw it in the guest room."
1,"Loud, not much power","This little fan makes a lot of noise and does not move much air. I was very disappointed with it. I would not recommend this item to anyone. Holmes has always been a decent brand name but they missed the mark with this little ""Blizzard"" fan."
4,Lil Jet Engine,"Let me tell you this thing is powerful, I only use it on low,...it's extremely noisy...the switch on the back is also wierd, I can't understand why companies won't put out an extra buck for a switch on the front, where you can reach it easier. Thats said it works, and would be great if you didn't have AC."
4,Does the job,The fan is good value for money. The 2nd setting is quite powerful and one can feel the air even at a distance of 3-4 feet. Ideal for small rooms. The reason for giving it 4 stars is that it makes an irritating clicking noise on oscillating mode. But overall I am pleased with the purchase.
4,Small but powerful,"I like this little fan - it is easy to move around from place to place in the house. The white noise is excellent for sleeping. I wish there were 3 speeds instead of 2, so I could put it on a low setting. Otherwise, very happy with this tiny tornado."
3,More powerful and louder than expected,"This little fan can certainly throw some air around, but in doing so it ends up being a little louder than I was hoping for. The fan fits very nicely on my desk at work, but the fact that it's so strong even on the lower of the two settings means that I need to keep it farther away from me so that all of my work doesn't start blowing around like one of those phone booths with the dollar bills in it.The fan comes assembled and all you have to do is plug it in and enjoy. The settings are basic and take no time at all to get used to. I'd highly recommend this fan if you have a medium to large size office and if you don't mind the fact that it can be a little noisy. I think this would be a little much to stick in a cubicle or a very small office."
2,Died after 3 months,"The fan was fine and worked well when it worked. I used it for some white noise and air circulation in my toddler's room.After about three months it started making some odd noises when I'd turn it on but after a minute or two it ran normally until one day it just wouldn't turn on.Maybe I got a dud, but I'm not willing to chance buying another one when this one had such a short life."
4,still going strong,"Bought this as a gift for an employee in my office last year. She loves it. She's a ""hot"" person. She uses all year long even though the rest of us are cold. It gets a lot of use. It's still going strong and she loves it. I've never noticed any noise from it so it's a winner.It's only 4 stars because I'm not the actual user."
2,"Cheap, Poor Quality Fan.","It move a really nice amount of air, the look is COOL, the size is perfect and this thing is CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP... really poor materials and assembly quality.A lot more noise than the Honeywell Super Turbo ThreeSpeed Fan. It was RETURNED after a little more than a week. SO CHEAP!!!"
2,"Powerful, but noisy","Pros:Very lightweightBlack colorStable baseStrong fanCons:LOUD....even louder on high!knobs feel cheap, I think one of mine is about to fall off.Did I mention loud? goodness...Returning it tomorrow."
2,"Loud, rattling, but looks nice and works","I'm not sure why fans cost so much money, but they seem rather expensive in local stores, so I tried this one.If it wasn't such a pain to carry it down to the post office, I'd send it back--and if I knew what I would buy to replace it. The fan rattles obnoxiously when it starts up or comes to a stop. Normal operation is a bit louder than I would like, but it does move plenty of air around for such a small fan.But the fan looks good on my desk, so I'll hang onto it for now. But I might have been wiser to spend a little more on something better."
3,You get what you paid for,Pros:the price. it works...it's a fancon:the difference between setting I and II is not much or a differencefeels flimsy. made of plastic. on/off is at the back. packaging looked damaged
3,"Well, it is quiet.","It is quiet because unlike the Blizzard fan I had bought in the past it's air flow was severely limited. It has 2 settings, both of which blow less air than the old model on low. I found myself looking for replacements the next day, unfortunately not finding the old version of this fan I had to look at other brands."
1,Same old stuff.,Same old stuff to be found in any get your life in order book. would not recommend. glad i got on kindle rather than buying the book.
3,A quick read...if you dont put it off until later.,"I started reading this book 4 months ago, but just finished it last week. For a book so small that doesn't say much.This book delivers on humor and very practical advice, but for me it just seemed to say things I already knew such as keeping a to-do list that breaks major tasks into mini-tasks. To be fair, there was other advice, but nothing that just made me sit up and transform my behavior.Having said that, I don't think it is a bad book and it wasn't unpleasant to read, but I really expected more. I chose a 3-star rating because while I felt better for a day or two after reading it, I didn't turn on that internal ""switch"".Unfortunately I have not read some of the other popular titles, so I have nothing I can recommend in place of this book - please keep that in mind when reading this review."
5,Nice bathroom lecture,I enjoyed this book. Every time I had to go; I found in this book new reasons to start doing procrastinated tasks at home and in my job. Thank You Ritta !
3,I don't know.....,"""The Procrastinator's Handbook"" is exactly what I need. The outline and 1st Chapter caught my attention, and I'm sure the rest is excellent. I really should read the rest of it. Maybe tomorrow...."
1,Not procrastinating here ...,"On page 108, Ms. Emmett's son asks and is answered that when people are really too busy, they have a choice to say no to some activities. After another question, she says that yes she does tell them that at her seminars. He replies, ""Well ... why does it take you eight hours to tell them that?"""
2,What's the use?,"I got it way back in the beginning of high school. Now I'm in college and I still haven't read it. It's almost like a cruel, taunting joke."
5,Don't put off getting this book.,"Rita Emmet's book is both entertaining and informative. She covers all the different kinds, and reasons of procrastination. It's a must have for anyone who puts things off."
2,Don't waste your money or time,"This book is a waste of money. 5% advice, 95% fluff you've read in other help books. At least get this book from the library, but don't buy it. It isn't worth the money."
5,Great Idea For A Gift,"Rita Emmett's first book is an excellent, easy read, fun way to help us stop procrastinating!! It is filled with many personal stories, that you might relate to. If you have a hard time getting to a project, you can find a constructive way to get yourself going. At least getting this book is one step further to ending your never ending ""To Do List"". It would be an excellent idea for a pre-Christmas gift for that last minute, shopping husband!"
3,Good advice,"I was going to write this sooner, but I couldnt get around to it. Ha Ha. The book has good advice, but is a little dry. I suppose with such a subject matter, it was done as well as possible."
3,I'd skip the cheerleading,"In parts one and two, and go straight to Pt 3, ""Proven Strategies"". This book is not without merit(again, part 3), but I wasn't crazy about it.If, like me, you dislike the insufferably cheerful types who want to sell you stuff and get you full of pep, I'd recommend Albert Ellis's **Overcoming Procrastination** over this book."
4,A Self Help Book that doesn't feel like a lecture.,"***NOTE MY REVIEWS OFTEN CONTAIN SPOILERS***I found this to be an excellent book. I enjoyed the work sheet questions at the end of each chapter and found some of the the methods to be helpful. Although even though I've finished reading the book I haven't quite gotten around to answering all the assignments and implementing all the methods. In theory I think they'll work well, it's just a matter of putting them in action. The book was written in a conversational tone and was a joy to read."
4,Excellent Service for International shipping,"The International shipping was quiclky and good for a regular shipping, the book in great condition, thanks!!!Excellent service, recommended."
2,a lot of fluff around a few good points,"the book was OK, but the extended examples provided little added value -- the same topics and concepts could be communicated in a much more compact presentation"
5,It Hit the Nail on the Head,"As a classic procrastinator and owner of my own business, I can say that Ms. Emmett's book was wonderfully accurate in assessing my weaknesses. Her methods for breaking the habit of procrastination are good ones which are easily applied. The fact that she offers several different methods make the trial and error process much less painful. I've applied her rules to my business and home life with success. I'm not cured altogether, but this book has me on the right track."
4,The more the merrier,"Made in 1943 by the great George Stevens, it is highly entertaining with Jean Arthur at her best. Charles Coburn won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the crafty old guy who put the young couple into position to fall in love."
4,Oddly Romantic,"This is one of my favorite movies. Jean Arthur shows off her impeccable comic timing and manages to keep up the charm. I am a huge Joel McCrea fan so in my book he can do no wrong; here's one film where others might actually agree with me.The film has some moments where you just have to laugh at the characters in a good-natured manner. One scene at a nightclub shows several women responding to McCrea's obvious charms -- you just have to snicker. Arthur and McCrea seem like such an unlikely couple that when overtures are finally made you find yourself being sweetly seduced along with Jean.One sour note, however. The movie is set during WWII and more than once uses a derogatory term for the enemy."
4,Jean arthur is just so good in this!,"This is the second movie I've seem about the housing shortage in Washington, D.C.during the war. They probably should have had the Army put up tents in the suburbs?They called the best and brightest for the war effort to D.C.and then treated them all like bums when they got there!The romantic comedy of 1940's US manners here is classic.Today all the people would have been in sleeping bagsand tents in backyards and vacant lots?I liked the movie because it reminded me of my Mom and my aunts."
2,Neither Stevens' nor Arthur's Best Work,"I certaily cannot agree with reviewers who thought the film to be too sexy, hot and heavy! In fact my problem with the film is its slow pacing, crude slapstick, and lack of real spark between McCrea and Arthur......this is not a great screwball comedy....it is at best a mild diversion."
4,Swerving round the Hays Office,"Not quite the best of Jean Arthur and Joel McCrae, but amusing none the less. The sit in the com is the accomodation shortage in Washington after Pearl Harbour, when the New Dealers hadn't moved out, but when FDR was drafting in all available expertise, regardless of party, to hit the Pacific running. Arthur sublets to Charles Coburn, who further sublets to McCrae, reckoning that Arthur needs a husband, and that McCrae fits the bill admirably.The pair drive a coach-and-four through the Hayes Office's one-foot-on-the-floor rule by occuping parrallel beds visible from the foot through two adjoining windows, allowing viewers to ighore the wall between the two bedrooms.Many pertinent cracks at politicians - times have not changed. Only the pork barrel's got bigger - and the politicians smaller."
5,The More the Merrier,the dvd came to me promptly and brand new. i would definitely order from this person again
2,Definitely Scandalous.,"On the cover of the DVD this movie is described as a scandalous romantic comedy. And I have to say, scandalous is the appropriate term. Due to the time period there isn't any nudity nor any love scenes. But that's about all it lacked. The plot centers around a girl in Washington D.C. who rents out half of her apartment to help ease the housing shortage in D.C. Well an eccentric millionaire moves in and decides to play match maker. What we end up with then is a very long and prolonged movie focusing on scenes where Connie and Joe almost get together, but then don't. The overtones of intimacy are rather strong throughout the film. And it seems like the writers were fascinated with their ability to get in a swear word by using Admiral Farragut's quote of ""D--- the torpedoes full steam ahead."" over and over and over again. In short, the movie comes across as a test for Hollywood to see how far they could go given the sensibilities of the time period. And go far they did."
1,Not a Family Friendly Movie!!,"We LOVE Jean Arthur in roles we have seen her previously play in. However, this is definitely NOT a movie you would watch with your children and grandma. Personally I have no desire to watch someone else being sexually aroused, and the continual inferences and innuendos do not compare to Veggie Tales! Hot and heavy."
1,Quite possibly one of the worst films ever!,"I cannot recommend for anyone to purchase The More the Merrier.The movie was made during World War II and contains extremely insensitive racial remarks. I am surprised that no one else should notice this. Furthermore this film is not at all funny in the least and contains a poor script plus poor actingperformances from every member of the cast. Personally, I also feel that compared to the other great comedians of time-Claudette Colbert, Carole Lombard, Lucille Ball,Greta Garbo, Irenne Dunne-Jean Arthur was just plain unattractive. Add to this the leading man-Joel MCcrea has no screen charisma and appears dull and wooden. I had to stop the film halfway through and throw away the videotape. A terrible waste of money for me, just don't let this happen to you. If anyone is looking for a classy comedy/romance I highly recommend Midnight starring Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche. You won't regret it."
5,Timeless Classic,"They don't make them like this anymore...they really don't! It is all so tastefully done, even when the actors are in bathrobes. It is sexy, erotic, funny, happy; all the ingredients of a romantic comedy, plus the magical chemistry between McRea and Arthur! And, all with their clothes on, no vulgarity in any sense of the word, no cursing or sexual inuendos. And, yet we can feel the love chemistry - amazing isn't it? If this movie played today it would be shocking only in its cleanliness -a timeless movie tastefully done in every sense of the word. Wake up Hollywood!"
2,Slow as a snail,"God i thought this HD was going to be the bomb! but not really, lack of speed and stability made me change it for an iomega 320Gb disk which was WAY faster... sorry guys at seagate, iomega may not be as design prone as u guys but it kicks @$$ in speed and stability."
3,Seagate External Hard Drive,"I like the drive, it is very fast and thorough. My only complaint is that it does not reconnect automatically when you turn your computer on. Also, it did not come with any backup software"
4,Great External Hard Drive,"I am very happy to not have to worry about my laptop crashing; I will always have my files backed up. The interface with the programing is a little bit harder to deal with than other hard drives, but once you get the knack it is great."
4,It works,I wasn't too sure it really worked. The Instructions for Use are scanty. I had an on-line chat with a technician and got all my questions answered. Now I am satisfied. Hope it keeps working.
4,Made my brother happy,"bought this for my brother since he wanted an external drive, at first he didn't like that it was a desktop drive, and it needed to be plugged, but since it's 250 GB of storage this drive's now my brothers best friend, because he needs a lot of storage space for his renders, besides...he doesn't know about it...but I think it is in a very good price...I was going to buy a 500 GB storage but it was priced double, and it needed a lot more space..."
4,Works Great,"Unlike some other Apple owners who had problems with new drive recognition, my machine immediately discovered the new drive..it was ready for use in a minute, with no problems..."
1,Don't bother - Buyer Beware!,"I first bought my FreeAgent Desktop 250GB about 2 years ago. It was purchased so I could easily backup a couple of machines that I own. It was great to setup and speed seemed pretty good. I went to run another backup months later and it started failing well into the backup. Seagate support was great and I arranged an RMA online and new one was delivered from Singapore within 2 weeks (probably closer to one)...that was a year ago. I was using the drive about a month ago to copy files off my PVR and everything went swimmingly! I tried backing up a laptop yesterday as the lappy was heading in for repair and exactly the same symptoms as last time. I have another RMA arranged and fingers crossed I get a good one next time. In the meantime I'll be getting a Western Digital 500GB SATA drive for my PC and performing all backups to it. Ironically the drives I'm backing up have never failed, unlike the FreeAgent."
4,Nice Product,"Very Nice product. Works great. Back-up software is lacking a bit, but the drive functions nice and does the job."
1,Piece of crap,"I bought this for my mother over Christmas and when I plugged it in, there was no power. So I exchanged it for another identical drive and it had the exact same problem. The only way to get it to power on was to jiggle the power cable. 2 bad drives in a row? Ridiculous.I returned it and bought a Western Digital and that was fine.I'll never buy another Seagate product."
4,Have had no problems in 3 years,"I plug into the wall. I plug USB port into computer. It asks do I want to back up my computer onto the Seagate. I say yes. It backs up everything. Same thing, once a week.When my old computer died I plugged in Seagate and it restored all my stuff on new computer.I have no clue why anyone would have a problem - just not my experience."
5,Good deal on good product,I've bought a total of 5 of these external hard drives in the past month or so. The prices are low enough that I now use a dedicated hard drive as my 'safe' backup for various files I keep on my computer's hard drive. These drives work seamlessly right out of the box with Windows XP Home. I like the light bar which reminds me to disconnect the hard drive after making a backup. Writing and reading speeds are fine using a USB2 hookup from the desktop computer to the Freeagent hard drive.
4,Great hard drive for a great price!,This was an awesome deal for me. It extremely simple to use and has a lot of storage space for not much money. It is pretty sweet looking as well. The only downfall is that is not a portable hard drive. It needs to be plugged into a power source to be used (can't run off USB cord). Still a good deal!
5,Jodi's Law,My Niece loves this item as she is able to save all her law school work without using up the memory on her laptop's hard drive.
1,bad product,"it does not work at all,i feel like i was cheated like an idiot.I am thinking I will never buy something on amazon in the future.:["
