4,Original Retro,Looking through this is a fun romp through the past and it's great to see some of the original art that inspires many retro style cartoonists of today. Black Canary looks as great as ever and here you can see how it all started out.
2,"It's got most of what brides need, except for a guest list.","Given all the positive reviews, I purchased this planner. And, I'm definitely using it. However, it lacks a fundamental piece of my wedding puzzle, in my opinion: The Guest List - you know, the very loved ones you need to celebrate with.It's really a physically well-designed planner - just as the other reviewers mention.I truly wonder whether I simply got a defective copy, without a guest list? I need a list for a head count, to make sure we didn't miss anyone and to keep track of all of the correspondence (read: invitations, thank you's, etc.). I recommend poaching from another planning book/publication in order to add that vital section to this planner.I hope in its next edition, it includes a guest list, so that I can purchase it as gifts for newly-engaged friends & family.Otherwise - it's very nice."
5,Book every bride needs,"I bought this book because I needed to have a concise list of questions to ask as I was planning my wedding. The questions were great, insightful and very useful when interviewing vendors. I highly recommend this book."
2,Not A Very Good Read,"The language in this book was very dry and not very interesting. It provided some useful information but you have to get through the jargon first. At the end of the semester, almost all of the students in my class recommended that my professor use a different book for the next semester."
2,Murder in a very cool room,"This is the film that Ed Sherman used as the plan to murder his wife. However, he ended up sentenced to 50 years in prison. Richard Whidmark does a good job in the rather dated film."
4,A nice thriller chiller,"I admit I am a Richard Widmark fan. Any movie Richard Widmark plays in I will watch. This story has such a nice plot amnesia,murder.I just have a comment. I would love to see this movie and stepfather 1 on DVD."
3,Suspense you can stir with a spoon,"If memory serves me correctly, this film was a made-for production on HBO back in 1985. The cast is top-notch, and the story plays on serial killers from the '70's and early '80's. I won't reveal the entire plot, but I will say that this is a somewhat disturbing picture to watch. Especially while alone in the dark. I recommend viewing this movie with at least another person in the room. Just make sure you know that person well, and that your telephone is off the hook..."
4,"Expertly played modern pop music, simply great.","A fine, little pop band from L.A. Wonderful songwriting, playing, singing, production - you name it. Fans of bands like Big Star and Teenage Fanclub will be especially enthralled."
1,Keep Chewing,Great band name but sucky (emphasis on sucky) mellow pop songs.Try the Hang Ups or Saturday Looks Good To Me instead. And please stop with the Teenage Fanclub comparisons.
4,I like this book.,"This book is so cool! I love it. I like that there's a baby beluga in the book, and the cat and the dog and the mice. Because they keep the baby beluga company and they help him get home."
1,Why Otters Don't Make Good Pets,"The reason I don't recommend this book, despite the nice writing and decriptions of the Western Highlands, is for one dark fact: a number of wild otters died for Maxwell's selfish pursuit of having a wild animal as a pet. This is not the story of a man who raises abandoned wild otters cubs in the Western Highlands and releases them but the story of a man who takes otters from the wild in Iraq and Africa and tries to raise them in Scotland. What this story also tells us is that, if you are of a privillaged class, you can have any wild animal you want as your pet. Today this is illegal ""pet"" trading and it is responsible for pushing certain species to the edge of extinction. I know that at the time this practice was not looked down upon as it is today and certain other nature writers (Durrell, Heinrich) engage in the same practice but with a more educated populus it should be clear: wild animals are not pets and they should stay wild!"
2,Convicts,Story went nowhere for the amount of acting talent involved . I kept thinking it was going to build up to something & before I knew it the Unclimatic ending was there in front of me.Very disappointed but.... oh well.
1,Duvall superb not so for Convicts,"As usual, Robert Duvall's acting was phenomenal - why I purchased the movie - BUT the movie itself was pointless and boring. My husband and I fell asleep.....when we woke up Robert Duvall's character was dead! Enough said."
1,Disappointing,"Absolutely, utterly and completely boring. This has to be Duvall's worst movie ever. The story line was about an old man who, it seemed, had lost his mind. I kept waiting for a plot or something to happen, but there was nothing. The only part that included ""convicts"" was in the first scene and then just an old man's rambling imagination. Nearly every sentence contains ""G** damn"" in it. The coffin scene was hideous.Ok, I sat bolt upright, took my ginseng, B-12 and Acai berry and I still feel like falling asleep it is so dull. This movie was a terrible. Not worth watching even if you paid $1 for it. So, if you have a hard time falling asleep, just pop this movie in, you will be out in 60 seconds tops....ZZZZZ!"
1,Stick To Lonesome Dove,"Sorely disappointed in this movie which was painfully boring. I am a huge Robert Duvall fan but would advise his true fans to stick to Lonesome Dove, his best work ever. I did check the 5 star reviews before buying this dvd but feel I was totally misled. As the saying goes, ""What were they thinking?!"" The CONTINUAL cursing was such a turnoff as well as the constant gibberish from Duvall's character. The viewer gets that his mind has gone to pot in the first 15 minutes of the film and thinks there will be a storyline somewhere but no, 'tis not so."
1,Convicts,Don't waste your money like I did.......Robert Duvall westerns are usually great but this one was MAD !!!!!!
3,Bob Duvall,"If you are a Robert Duvall fan, you will like this movie. It is alright, not the greatest movie that he's been in."
2,Not Duvall's Best By A Long Shot,"This is one of those movies that had about 30 minutes worth of script, and they stretched it into 90 by covering the same ground over and over. The performances are good. I'm a fan of Duvall and Jones, but this film was a waste of their talents."
3,YAWN,"I'm a big fan of Duvall and so gave this movie three stars, but this is sheer boredom. For those 17 adherents of this DVD, I say, ""Look, the emperor has no clothes!"" To see Duvall at his best, try ""Broken Trail."" A masterpiece of the West."
2,Don't waste your money!,90+ minutes of same dialogue by a drunkard! Disappointed that Duvall would participate in such a no-nothing piece of filming.
2,Disappointing,"I thought with these tremedeous actors, this was a no way to miss. Not so. I was very disappointed. You never really knew the root of the bitterness and pain of this story. It was just bleak and depressing with very little essence."
3,Duvall-Convicts,"Although I love Robert Duvall, I was disappointed in this movie. I didn't feel there was much plot, except for his hate of black people. This may have been a real scenario of the ways life was in that time, but I really didn't enjoy it as I have most Duvall movies."
5,Take the Heat,"I don't need this anymore but it was a lifesaver when I was in hot, humid weather and going through hot flashes. It goes on easily to control the shine without clogging pores or making skin feel too dry in any way. Topped with a dusting of powder or not you're good to go all day despite the weather or your hormones."
3,His last concert album,"Released soon after Elvis' death in 1977, while Elvis in not in top form during these performances and it is not as good as his earlier live albums, this was a big hit. It peaked at number 5 on the US album chart but went all the way to number 1 on the US Country Album chart. It would eventually be certified MULTI-PLATINUM. It includes the hit song ""My Way"" which reached number 22 on the US singles chart and was a top ten hit in the UK. The song would reach number 2 on the US Billboard Country Singles chart and number 1 on the rival Cashbox Country Singles chart. This album is a must for Elvis fans."
4,Refreshing and interesting,A sparkling work that I find myself returning to for inspiration and insights. A nice balance of conceptual analysis and practical excercises that I have rarely found in books on the subject. I highly recommend it!
5,gfcfsf pretzels.....great snack,"Our guy is gluten, casein, soy free. Very picky about his snacks.He love, love, loves these pretzels. They are a great alternativeto other illegal snacks for him. They taste almost exactly likegluten-filled pretzels."
4,not the best,"Both my kids love these. I think the Glutino GFCF ones are better, but if you are avoiding soy, these are good. They are pretty hard and crunchy. Not loaded with salt which is nice if you are giving them to kids."
3,not bad,"as far as gluten free products go - these aren't bad. seems like nothing is really ""good"" so the best you can hope for is not terribly unpalatable."
2,Not so good,I thought they had a stale texture and they didn't have enough salt. Ener-G does make a type of sesame pretzel that is incredible but these aren't it. Hope this helps all the gluten-free people like me.
1,Gluten Free Pretzels,"I've been buying this product for years at the HfS, but decided to start ordering cases on Amazon. The product came not packed well and the pretzels were in a million pieces and clumps. I emailed Amazon and they sent me a new case. Well, the same thing. I emailed them again and theyrefunded me and I was thrilled at the exceptional service !!!!!BTW, these pretzels are very good and also soy free !"
1,Hard as can be.,Taste like I am chewing on glass. Hard and I am afraid I am going to break a tooth. Don't waste your money on this product.
3,Good but hard,"The taste is pretty good, but the pretzels are overly hard. They can be difficult to eat because of this."
5,My highly allergic son's favorite pretzels!,"These are harder/crunchier than other pretzels, & lower in salt. That's why we like them so much. My son - who has severe food allergies - can eat these without any problems. They make a great addition to his school lunches.Enjoy!"
5,Super snack!!,"Well, it is all about personal taste, and I love these! If you have to begluten free these pretzels make a great snack. I haven't actually tasted a regular pretzel in over 20 years, and I never really liked them anyway. But these are perfect. Small, not too salty, and fresh, I think they are a super snack food. I buy them by the case and so does my father, sister-in-law, and brother. All have a gluten intolerance and think that these are the best since sliced bread!"
2,not what I expected,"My favorite pretzels in the world are Ener-g sesame pretzel rings-light and crispy and with seeds on the pretzels. Thought I was buying those,only in a bigger package.These are hard and dry-not crispy-dry!and must be made with ground sesame seeds because I can't find a seed on any of them.Next time will read description and check picture better."
2,There are other and BETTER gluten-free pretzels out there...,"We have been a gluten free family for many years and have been enjoying the new products that are now continully being introduced. These pretzels are not nearly as good as the ones by Ener-G Foods (small size bags) or by Glutano (larger, family size bags). These Wylde pretzels are, as one reviewer already commented, not salty enough - that is, not salty enough for me to feel they qualify as satisfying a pretzel yearning. These pretzels are also much harder than the others, which I don't find appealing. That being said, I would highly recommend the Glutano or the Ener-G Foods pretzels over these. I rated it 2-stars simply for being another gluten free product."
1,Stale again,"This is the second order recently received that contained a case of stale pretzels. Every bag was stale. No excuse with posted expiration date over 6 months out.Until recently I have had no complaints with the quality of these pretzels, and my family has really enjoyed them. But now having paid over $60 for 2 stale cases, you will lose a good customer if this happens again."
1,No salt!,"I'm all for reduced-salt, but no-salt is just nasty. I love sesame seeds so I was really eager to try these, but blech. They are also too hard not crispy - Glutino's pretzels are much better."
1,forget it,"My daughter has recently had to avoid gluten due to an immunity issue and we tried these locally. She is picky, but I tried one and almost lost my stomach. Horrible. There are other items that she likes. When it comes to snacking we just stick to potato and corn products and avoid anything sesame ."
1,bad,horrible - got rid of all of them- It was the wrong buy for what I needed. could not give them away
2,Not Great,"I bought this due to the name as I have several levels which are great. My main complaint is how flimsy the tape is as it bends and twists really easy, it cannot extended very far without support."
1,NOT A $16 TAPE!,"this is about a $5 tape. only 3/4"" wide. so heavily packaged, i ruined the clip unwrapping the product. cheaply made. i should not have bought 2!"
5,Great Laptop,"I have bought this laptop 1 month ago, I really liked it very much. it arrived in time and i have opened the box and i have found every thing included as advertised. it is simple to use and the small size made it even easier to use it simply any where. Battery life was much better than expected, now I take it out without the charger and i know that I will not need it for the whole time that I'm out.as they say ""It's a SONY"" it will be always the best"
1,"Terrible ""record"" of the Beatles","This ""record,"" while full of photos of the Fab Four, is not an objective history of the biggest selling band of all-time. Rather, the ""authors"" (I use that term loosely) see fit to bury most of the Beatles' solo work (save John Lennon). The only reason I gave this book one star is that negative star ratings are not available."
5,"If you buy Mindstorms, buy this book!","Out of the box, Lego doesn't teach you how to get the most out of your investment. This book does. I found many great insights from this book and have used them quite extensively with my robot building. Dealing with the real world of sensors and motorized outputs is harder than you think, and this book helps teach you practical ways of dealing with these challenges."
2,Can you say dull?,"I thought Mindstorms was supposed to be fun. I found this book to be incredibly dry and boring. Sure, the author's a great programmer, but I just want to have some fun with Mindstorms. At least the O'Reilly book made for some interesting bedtime reading. <grin>"
3,just buy the season sets.,"This keeps with the format of the previous collections - 10 eps on 2 DVDs. Kind of a strange run of shows here...Kari's out on maternity leave, so Jessi Combs fills in for her. She's good and fits in with the team - she also specializes in cars, so you get a TON of car myths, which gets a little odd when you watch them back-to-back like this.Honestly, if you're a fan and want to own episodes of the show, buy the season sets on here or Discovery's site. The ""Season 7"" set has all of the episodes here, plus many more AND deleted scenes. (it's 50 bucks on Discovery right now, and it's better than paying $15 for this.)"
5,Good mix of episoded,I like this collection. Some really good episodes that I had not seen in awhile. I love Mythbusters. For those that do not want to purchase whole season this is a great alternative.
4,Looks good,Haven't used it yet but the grease gun looks like a quality piece and the grease and oil look to be good for the job
2,Oil bottle leaks and grease applicator tough to connect to grease tube.,"The closed oil bottle leaks when lying down. Although being careful during the process, I was not able to get the metal grease injector connected to the plastic grease tube without stripping the threads. The oil and grease seem to be high quality, but delivery has been the problem."
3,Lube kit.,Pump was difficult to set up on tube but got it on eventually. hard to bleed the air out of grease gun. the oil is fine.
1,IR products,IR products are great. But the grease tube threads aren't the same as grease needle? I made it thread on but was expecting better product when package says IR
5,Very Interesting Portrait of Great Commedian,"I just finished watching this film and I thaught it was great. Most people would probably say ""My, that quality was just terrible."" Well, this is true. It was the late '80s when film technology was a bit shakey, but one has to set that aside after awhile and just remeber that they are getting a very rare and unique look into the final days of Chapman. His stories are funny, the glimses into his Python days are very interesting, especially if you haven't seen the Life Of Python box set yet. The stories are good, and it was very entertaining. However, if you are a technology buff, this may be a bit frustrating. I tried looking beyond that and realized what an interesting look into Chapman's life I was able to have. So...5 stars. This one is good."
1,NOT XP COMPATIBLE,"My daughter loved Orly on her old Windows 98 computer, but when we upgraded her to to a new computer using XP, the old program wouldn't work. So, I was so pleased to find a version that was advertised as XP compatible. The only problem -- IT WASN'T. This is an even older version of Orly. I've returned it to Amazon, but have not yet found out if I'll be refunded the money spent. The whole thing was so disappointing for all of us. Bummer."
4,Michael Brecker fans,"I have two vinyl copies of this recording. It recorded in 1976 with Michael Brecker on all but one (maybe two) cuts. It's early Mike Brecker and in the style of smooth jazz, but clearly Michael. Other musicians on this recording are Will Boulware, Eric Gale Gordon Edwards, Steve Gadd and Ralph MacDonald."
1,This is not Rainbow featuring Ritchie Blackmore,"This is an album I picked up back in the mid-eighties and found disappointing, thinking it was the rock band Rainbow. Not only was it not some rare release by Blackmore and crew but it was poor by any style, it`s low grade jazz want-a-be."
2,What a mark-up,Purchased this product in February and went to place a follow-up order and the price had increased almost $25.00 since then. Sheesh.
5,Martha Dixon's Copper Kettle Cookbook,"I have owned this cook book for 42 years. I have had many other cook books but I always go back to this one. The recipes are practical and so easy to follow. I am going to buy another cook book just like the one I have, because mine is in such bad shape from overuse."
3,Plan to enjoy this book,"The book I have is the exact one but it's blue instead of pink. It was a good book to read, but, nothing stood out that I remember without opening it up and glancing back through the pages. I think the title aims to latch on to the writers who may think of themselves as advanced writers and it backfires by not really giving any new information that the Marshall Plan For Getting Your Novel Published: 90 strategies and techniques for selling your fiction to brag about."
2,unhappy with product,"The book itself is good and in good shape. However, I did not receive the CD that was supposed to be with it."
1,Filthy Liars,right next to the title of the book it says(with cd) there was no cd which in turn caused me much inconvenience. With the cd the cost of the book was very inexpensive but without it it was a rip off. and the book was in poor quality. Dont buy unless you want to get scammed.
4,CD's for Class,"The CD's were an excellent learning tool to have with the book we used in our Music Appreciation class they helped me to learn more about Classical,Opera and other types of music and how to tell the deference."
5,A truly indepth and entertaining book!,"This work is incredible; I couldn't put the book down! He portrays ancient Sparta/Athens in ways that make me feel like I've visited there. His descriptions are wonderful, as well as his dialogue. The hero, Arison, is all I could want in a hero. I strongly recommend reading this book!"
5,"Let's make it unanimous, 5 stars here, too!","This is the only Frank Yerby I've ever read. I first read Goat Song in 1973, & recently found it at a yard sale & figured I'd see if it had held up. I was very happy to see that this has stood the test of time, and since far more is now known about the ancient Greeks and their neighbors than there was in the '70's, I think I may have enjoyed this even more than 35 years ago. My best friend is a Mists Of Avalon series junkie, & I'm looking forward to her reading this. This would really be an great movie, just without a Steve Reeves or other talentless Hollywood Hunk-Ra as Ariston."
3,Is it accurate?,"As a Bears season ticket holder and lifelong fan who attended the same grade school (St. Emily's in Mt. Prospect, IL) as the McCaskey children and grew up their neighborhood, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Then, right on page 3 it says the McCaskeys lived in Arlington Heights when they actually lived in Des Plaines, and I am left wondering how many other inaccuracies this book contains. It seems very anti McCaskey."
5,a definite must have,"the mla handbook is a must have for any english major (or any other college student), writer, or professional. it's easy to understand and covers everything. it's probably the best help you can have when writing a paper."
2,purchased new but got old,"I purchased a ""new"" copy of this book; however, I received a musty smelling book with yellowing pages and writing on the inside. That doesn't sound ""new"" to me!"
1,The MLA Is a Joke,"Not many scholarly or academic journals, much less reputable publishers, recommend the use of the MLA, and for good reason. It's not very thorough, and many of its recommendations are against the prevailing views. Annual MLA meetings are often the bane of serious writers and academia, and is frequently the material for murmors and shouts. The book seems attractive, because it's short. If a briefer version of the ""Chicago Manual of Style,"" *the* authority on style, is desired, then Kate Durabian's book based on ""Chicago"" is the reccommended version. For the very economical, which is not suitable for serious papers, there is always ""Elements of Style,"" a perennial favorite of style. But don't waste time and money on MLA, where you'll learn to do things wrong, and be told bad form is okay."
2,Doesn't work with 1650 psi pressure washer,"No instructions comes with the wand. There is no minimum psi rating and this unit does not suck up sand to mix in with the pressure washer water stream. It works by venturi effect and the supplied tube (3/4"")probally is way oversized for the 1650 psi unit I have. I read that it works with a 2500 psi unit, which I may rent to get this working."
2,Beware,"Do not be misled by this item. It seems to be Harold Pinter's great ""Betrayal"" with Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge, shown on the cover. The cover photo has nothing to do with film. It is a poorly transferred made for tv movie, which I did'nt even bother to watch. I have been waiting for Pinter'sBetrayal which has yet to be put onto dvd and was hoping this would be it. Don't bother with this dud."
1,The Wrong Movie!,"I ordered this movie because amazon said that it was the one that stars leslie anne warren and Rip Torn, but it's NOT! It's a different movie which happens to also be called Betrayal. I got ripped off! Don't buy this movie!"
2,"Sorry Terry, but no Klaatu","I was very happy to see that Terry Draper came out with a new CD until I played it. Terry mostly tries to go it alone(vocals) without John W. or Dee Long even though they are listed as vocalists on the inside cover. Sorry Klaatu fans, the legend ended with Magentalane!"
5,A real find,Heard this on an obscure Brazilian jazz program on a smooth jazz station in Miami. Lots of diversity in the cuts makes it easy to hear over and over. A very different sound for jazz lovers and those interested in Latin music.
4,informative,"Yang does a very good job in not only pulling together subject matter for the scholar interested in the subject, but leaves it clear and concise for the layperson as well."
5,Awesome gun,"Bought this gun for the nerf wars at work, and basically own the floor. Shoots further than a basic nerf gun, and allows you to fire all the missiles at once (not rapid fire, truly at once) or one at a time. Durable enough for regular use."
3,mediocre,I thought this book was creative but did not have a very good plot.It seems suitable for younger kids.His other books are much better.
4,Brother print cartridge,This cartridge was good and exactly the one that my fax machine requires. Installing the cartridge is easy and takes less than 5 minutes to do.
5,Brother fax cartridge,"Perfect and much cheaper price than brand name stores I looked around because I wanted the original cartridge that goes with the fax machine and this was the best price I found, at least $10 cheaper than in the office supply stores and free shipping can't go wrong with this one. I Love Amazon"
2,Needs closed captioning,"Unless the viewer has the play memorized, closed captioning would often be needed to catch what is being said ""dramatically"" in this DVD. So frustrating. This particular performance of Macbeth focuses on Shakespeare's words by drastically minimizing the action, scenery and costuming, so for the words to be undiscernable is a big flaw. I always prefer to use closed captioning because my son is hard-of-hearing, but everyone would benefit from it with this DVD."
5,Beautiful genuine Shakespeare production,"I am glad that the old production of Macbeth by McKellen, Drench is now available also on DvD. It is a genuine Shakespeare interpretation with all the tragedy, poetry and humor as only Shakespeare could put it into a drama."
4,Sanity Erupted,"This version of Macbeth, which is a triumph I must add, made me very pleased to watch it. And although there is no real set, but a circle surrounded by rocks, this film was very emotional. It does not use much gore in it to show that it is a horror film. This version of Macbeth shows Ian McKellen, the man who portrayed Gandalkf in The Lord of The Rings, at his best in this shakespearian work. It does not even show Macbeth's head at the end, yet this work has all of the wit, horror, and cleverness to be declared a shakespearian treasure."
1,Out! Out! Damn Spot!,"Would that the bard himself had directed. Ian contorts and convolutes. Judi despises and denies. The whole stage to television adaptation loses the gripping starkness of the theatrical intent. Brits being Brits bringing the bard to the modern masses. How more cliche can it get? In 1976 this may have seemed the definitive version, and lord knows it made McKellen and Dench, but I still hold out hope against hope that an actor and actress will come forth and give this play the truly powerful pitch it deserves for the pallette of film."
2,TOO DARK AND MOODY FOR ME!,"I think that Ian McKellen and Judy Dench are two of the greatest people working in the film today. McKellen turned in a rather Shakespeare-esque performance as Magneto in X-MEN, and Dench has proved herself as a good M in thel last three JAMES BOND epics. So I was surprised that this film turned out to be a waste of time. Trying to capture the Bard's stage vision, Trevor Nunn screws up everything with this lumbering two-hour-and-sixteen-minute film. There are no sets, just blackness, making the dark tragedy TOO dark. The costumes are no good whatsoever. The acting is just plain terrible! The only saving grace in this film is Roger Rees. Please miss this peace of crap not worth seeing. Either watch Roman Polanski's version, or wait for Kenneth Branagh's version to come out. They're better than this is, I'm sure. Grade: D-"
1,dench out of her depth,"Splendid actress Judi, but she's no Lady Macbeth. Judith Anderson got it right! McKellen wanders about helplessly."
4,Mostly excellent!,"My 2 cents: I found this version gripping. Ian McKellan and Judi Dench really made me feel the agony of the Macbeths' self-imposed moral degeneration and madness. Dench's performance of the famous ""sleepwalking scene"" has got to be the best ever. Ian McDiarmid (later Star Wars' ""Emperor""), as Ross and as The Porter, was a fun surprise and excellent in both of those small parts. Seeing all these wonderful actors when they were younger was fun. And the minimalist sets and dark, dramatic lighting worked for me.A few criticisms:-- McKellan and Dench had no sexual chemistry, which made their attempts to kiss and nuzzle (in some scenes) just annoying.-- The actor who played Macduff was flat and unconvincing.-- No subtitle option. As with all Shakespeare, language is an issue and I had to refer to a written _Macbeth_ often.-- The costumes were a senseless jumble."
4,sub-tiltles wud have helped,"I realize any Shakespeare aficionado needs no subtitles, as he/she knows it all by heart. I for one get tired of reading my book to go along with the character's dialogue, but I suppose i too shall one day soon find myself mouthing the Bard's immortal words without thinking.The acting is GREAT."
5,MacBravo for Macbeth,"McKellen and Dench are amazing. The entire ensemble is terrific. This production focuses on performance over spectacle, with little to no set design and a combination of period and modern costuming. The darkness of the lighting design supports the themes of light/dark. At some points, the actors look directly at the camera, which can be a jolting convention for some. For Macbeth fans, this is a must."
2,"No Close Captioning, Not Useful in the Classroom!","Shakespeare is all about the words. Without close captioning, this video is unusable with high school kids. For that reason, I returned it to Amazon for a refund."
2,you're better off reading Macbeth aloud to yourself,"I didn't like the idea that there were no props. No stage sets. No real lighting effects to speak of. No good costume work. This movie reading of Macbeth takes place in a dark room, where the actors say their lines to each other, and sometimes, just by themselves.That's all fine and good if you already intimately know this play. But even though I have read it countless times, I couldn't even sit through this entire production. I was very disappointed in it, especially after seeing who the actors were. Part of the magick in performing a play onstage is the use of props, lighting, interaction, costuming, etc., to engage the audiences imagination.This seemed to be to be a read aloud, book-on-tape style production. Yes, the recitation of the lines was well-done. But there was nothing else to compel me to finish it. I can read it myself."
3,A True Shakespeare Play!,"Warning -- if you expect to see Macbeth in a realistic settings similiar to the recent Othello and Hamlet, you'll be disappointed. This play takes place on a stage.However, the film adheres very closely to the written play. This film is instrumental to learning the play for a class."
2,Not High School friendly,"Not exaclty what I had wanted for my high school class. It was a bit too sophisticated and did not have the colorful and vivid quality so craved by high school students. I would recommend it, though, for junior college and for serious Shakespere fans."
3,Is this a dagger...?,"In this minimalist set probably not. Trevor Nunn's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth features a fantastic (young) cast led by Ian McKellan, and concentrates more on the psychological instead of the physical. With a nearly bare stage and missing characters (Ghost of Banquo), the audience must rely on the acting to understand what is happening within the play. With a little imagination the viewer can see two shows what is physically there and the more elaborate version in his mind."
1,Out Out PERIOD!,"Ordered this two months ago without having a chance to watch it...past return period so glad it was cheap but this DVD is totally worthless! It'd be ok, if I just didn't like this production...""different strokes for different folks""...but not only is this possibly the stalest, most anemic version of ""Macbeth"" EVER including every totally BAD junior high school production you've ever seen... but THE SOUND IS NOT COORDINATED WITH THE ACTORS FACIAL GESTURES...think ""Macbeth"" as done by Milli Vanilli IN SEMI DARKNESS AND A TOTALLY GRAINY PICTURE! HORRIBLE! Just cannot believe it?"
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed that the description of this DVD stated that it was closed captioned, but it is not. Since the captioning was the main selling point for me, it was a useless purchase."
2,Maybe I`ll Move to Mars,"Being a big fan of Klaatu`s superb first two albums Magenta Lane came as a big dissapointment. There are too many pointless, mediocre ballads, well played, sung and produced yes, but this is not the klaatu I`d come to love. Mercifully the album is not much above 30 minutes. Only the album closer ""Maybe I`ll Move To Mars""- an epic space opera - is worthy of the name Klaatu. If you are new to Klaatu this is not the place to start(try ""Klaatu"" aka ""3:47 Est"" or ""Hope""). If you are a fan of Klaatu, this may be the place to stop."
1,Half star better than Endangered Species.,"""Mrs Toad Bake some cookies"" and the ""Magentalane"" title track are the only songs of any redeeming value here. Again, one was hoping for something to replace the bad taste that one had in their mouth after the Endangered Species fiasco, but only a burp was mustered up by Klaatu."
5,Many hours of enjoyment,"""The Biography of An American Hero"" is excellent. I purchased the audio book for my Dad. Due to his health conditions, he isn't able to read. I remember him telling me stories about going to watch Williams play when he was a kid. I'm not much of a baseball fan myself, but I thought listening to the biography would bring my Dad some happiness. Turns out I've enjoyed it myself. This is a great story about a true American hero. My Dad and I have gotten many hours of enjoyment listening to Ted's life story together. I would highly recommend it to anyone, whether baseball fan or not."
3,"A ""Jekyll & Hyde"" of a Biography","Leigh Montville's biography presented quite the conundrum for this reader. Quite extensive (weighing in at just over 500 pages) the book is crammed full of wonderful anectdotes that give a great look at both the positive and negative aspects of Ted Williams the man and player. It also contains more information on his post-baseball life than most biographies do. What bothered me about the book though was the numerous mistakes in key dates from Williams' life. Montville's book lists the wrong month for Williams' birth, the wrong date for his first homer, his first 2-homer game, opening day 1942, and even the wrong date for his wedding to Doris Soule (just to name a few). If you are only looking for a book that brings you a closer look at Ted Williams personality, then this is the book for you, but, if you are a stickler for details, then perhaps stick with the earlier biographies by Ed Linn and Michael Seidel which do not suffer from so very many errors."
4,Complicated man - now he'd be medicated!,"I enjoyed this biography (except for a glaring typo in an early chapter that gives TW's birthday as April, 1918 instead of August....where was the editor??!). I have to wonder, however, if the personality ""quirks"" that TW displayed would be accepted in today's world. His on-the-field persona was one thing, but the verbal abuse of his family was often over the top. But, a true America original."
2,warning - it's not a clean romance,This is not a clean romance - the profanity and premartial sex really detracted from what could be a great book. It's a shame because the characters were well developed and the story interesting. It's a dirty read - I'll be deleting it.
2,Interesting plot,"This book has an good story line, but I was VERY disappointed in the sexual content of the book. I did not finish reading the book because of the inappropriate content. I was really interested in the story until then and think that it has the potential to be a great story without explicit scenes."
4,Touching,Great love story. This book is a real tear jerker. I'm looking forward to the next 3 books about the Grayson brothers.
3,"Ommigod, I didn't even know you could buy Christian reading","Well, the story was okay, but nothing extraordinary. I finished the book & it passed an afternoon away. There was nothing overtly wrong with Ms Lindstrom's writing style, the editing was ordinary as usual & I hate spelling mistakes. All things considered, the book was worth what I paid for it."
2,deleted it from my book,"It came up as a Christian book so I bought it. As the language began to get rougher, I realized it must not be Christian fiction. If it is Christian fiction shame on the author. When I tell my testimony of who I was before Christ, I don't go making it seem romantic, fun, and desireable. Thought love scenes were out of place if it is Christian fiction."
1,Not a Christian Fiction,I found this listed as Christian Fiction ans was sad to discover it is not. While it is mild compared to some the language & sexual situations are not what I care to read.
4,Wonderful history lesson!,"A touching, true-to-life story that brought about tears and chuckles. A great way to learn little-known facts about the Civil War!"
4,Great characters,Great characters with rich emotions. Good story development that keeps you hooked. A very fun read and not just romance readers
1,clean fiction,Very good good fiction I really enjoyed reading it the only problem was the book was too short! I highly recommend this bbook-
4,good read,I love historical romance books and this is one of them. I have read the next book and looking forward to the third.
3,It's an OK,"This book is alright. As with alot of romance novels, you usually know who's going to be the lovers in the first couple of chapters. Also I don't know why this was compared to Lavyrle Spencer novels, it is nothing as grand as most of her novels!"
2,Too Graphic,"I ordered this book because it was free; however, once I got into the story, the main focus is on Radford's passion, written in very graphic detail. The book uses a lot of expletives and has crude remarks which are unnecessary. The story line could have been more productive by letting the reader fill in the details rather than spelling out the passions felt toward Evelyn. Although the book shows the human emotions of bitterness and envy, as well as compassion, between brothers, it is hard to get past the daily passions of Radford which are always in the forefront. I could not finish the book and deleted it from my Kindle. I love to read, but will choose books that are more uplifting without the language and intimate details."
5,Shades of Honor,"This is a terrific book! I'm shocked to discover it was a debut novel. The author was able to write a historical romance that had enough romance but didn't go overboard. Including family honor, PTSD and a scared little girl who didn't know how to be a little girl. It actually made me cry in a couple spots. Very realistic; this could have easily been a true story. Great writing. Great Civil War research. I can't say enough good things about it."
4,Pretty good story,"This book was well-written. It did a great job of focusing on the main characters, but also showing their relationship with others. The author really made you root for two main characters and hope that they would get past the issues keeping them apart."
3,An enjoyable book,"This story was reasonably well written and the two main characters, Radford and Evelyn, well developed. Kyle, being the third person in the love triangle was also well represented.The author managed to inject moments of happiness, sadness and humour in her story. There were also poignant references to the Civil War, it's effect on soldiers and their families.However, disappointingly, Radford's other two brothers, Boyd and Duke, receive only scant mention and I'm not sure if the author did enough to interest me in buying any of the remaining 3 books in the series."
3,Not bad,"I will tell you frankly that I'm not a fan of either historical romances or Christian fiction so this wasn't exactly my genre. I generally prefer straight historical, however, this was better than what I usually see in those genres when it comes to historical. I did think there was an excessive emphasis on the sex, not because I object to sex in a novel, which I don't, but because a lot of it was gratuitous and added absolutely nothing to the story. However, the writing was competent and the author had done research on the civil war, so I think it does rate three stars."
2,Potential but didn't follow through,The book could have been good if the pace was sped up. But it just went on and on and became boring
4,Nice Historical Romance.,"This was a very pleasant story. It was a quick, easy read and keep you interested throughout. A bit predictable, but overall if you enjoy historical romances it is worth a look."
4,What a nice book,"I really like a story with a different recipe than the usual.I liked the fact that he fell in love with this brothers girl and how it worked into the story.This is really worth reading, a story well written.I recommend!"
3,Shades of Honor,"Shades of honor was a story of Love and family Honor , I would not rave about the book but it was readable light and easy reading but one you could walk away from without completing."
2,Ann of Indiana,"It is a very good story, but I wouldn't call it a Christian book. The language was offensive, morals questionable, and it was more racy than it should have been for a Christian book."
1,NOT CHRISTIAN FICTION,"This is NOT a christian book as listed under Amazon's ""Christian Fiction"" section. It has swearing, drinking and immorality. I did not finish reading it but flipped to the end and it glorifies sin which continues to hurt and destroy families."
1,Not what I was looking for,I was searching for free Christian fiction books and this one came up. I downloaded it and began to read. It is most definitely not Christian fiction! I have no idea why it came up under that list.
3,Sappyish - but OK.,"Haunted by a gruesome war and his own dark secrets, Former Union Soldier Radford Grayson returns home, seeking a loving reunion with his brothers and a place where he and his young daughter can make a home. Desperate for peace, Radford is ambushed by his unexpected and forbidden love for Evelyn -- his brother's fiancée.My rating for this hovers between 2.5 - 3 stars.This is not a keeper for me."
2,Not professional quality,"This tape measure is pretty flimsy, with about a 7 ft. stand out. It's comparable to a Craftsman, not what I'd expect from Stabila. I use tape measures pretty hard, and demand alot from them. Stanley Max steel is the only tape that's rigid and durable enough to stand up to the jobsite. Stanley Fat Max tape measures are too rigid. They tend to break sooner than the Max Steels. Stabila should stick to level market, where they rule."
2,Not what you'd expect,Stabila levels might be made in Germany but their tape measures aren't and it shows. They are made in Taiwan and are about the same quality as all the other junk tape measures out there.
4,Pretty Good!,This game is pretty fun and the controls are not a problem if you have a DS lite because you can use you pinkie finger to fire. thegraphics are ok and the idea is great! CANT WAIT FOR A SEQUAL!
2,.......,"Truthfully, paintball is a good game . But for me i just dont like it. Maybe it is made for boys or something like that , but after a few plays i put it down and never played it again. ^-^"
4,Cool but Difficult,"This is my 2nd Starck watch because I couldn't find another copy of my current one (the original HardStarck watch). This one looked just as cool... but didn't come with a manual and seems extremely difficult to program. I really like the look and interface but the ""configuation"" is not easy."
3,Not All That Impressive,"This box set reminds me of the compilation albums sold on TV. It's a lot of stuff here that's found all over the place, not even previously unreleased material. You could actually do better by getting the albums this stuff was lifted from. If you're new to the blues and looking for a good compass, this is your item. If you do have any sort of blues collection, however, there's a good chance you've already got everything here."
3,More for high school kids....but....,"The ""but"" is after reading the first chapter of this book and looking through the contents there are some useful projects. I've been using Publisher since 2000 for a newsletter and brochure for a non-profit group and not much more. But now I can see several new uses for the program and I'll give them a try. Granted it's not a hard program to master the bare essentials but I think this book may open a much wider range of uses for this user. The only bad thing is the steep price for the book itself. I really would like to give the book a 3.75 star rating..."
3,"Sweet, but unnecisary...","I got this CD mainly for the price. It is really just Black Sabbath vol.4 with the rea;;y terrible live version of Children of the Grave. It is sped up about 1.5 times as fast! I am on a very fixed budget, so this CD was perfect. I think it's sort of dumg that they made this.This CD has some great songs on it. For Example: Snowblind! I love this song! There's also Supernaut! I love almost every song on this CD Enjoy!"
2,its nice but....,I was impressed at how simple it was to put in. The only problem that I have found was that if your child is a houdini like mine is then you dont want to purchase this carseat. My 2 year old son can pull his arms out of the straps. I have to constantly pull over and fix his seat. I have had to purchase another car seat and have written to the company about the unsafeness of this seat.
2,Just okay!,"You get what you pay for it! Seemed like a pretty good car seat for the price, but now I hate it! The fabric gets stained really fast, you cant just wipe it. If any milk gets on it, it starts smelling really bad. And it's not too durable or comfortable. I would definitely get a different one if I was buying one right now!"
4,I remember,I do remember this when it happened an there are some strange people out there these's day's. I still enjoyed seeing the movie again
1,Totally Worthless,"The light is very cheaply made and did not work at all. I tried to change the battery, which should have been new, and the whole thing broke. Totally wasted my money, don't waste yours. I gave it one star only because I could not complete the review without rating it at least one, but I wouldn't even give it that."
4,Great Product,Great product. Ideal for kids ages 5-10 years. My son got it for christmas and absolutely loves it!
4,Fun for 8-year-old,"My 8-year-old daughter enjoys these, though they are a bit dated (as opposed to, say, Scooby Doo, which still seems fresh after all these years).One problem: none of the DVDs played on my cheap portable DVD player. They played fine on other players however, so we kept them."
4,Trip down Nostalgia Lane !!,"Where were you at 9am on Saturday mornings in 1974/1975? If you were a kid in the 70's, you likely were watching ABC and the series Hong Kong Phooey.Hong Kong's janitor alter-ego name is Penry, though a lot of folks thinks it's Henry.To clarify, there are 30 10-minute episodes, and one 20-minute episode (Comedy Cowboy) plus a couple of minutes of beginning and ending credits. Normally, two episodes were shown each Saturday. Commercials filled in the remainder of the 1/2 hour.The video quality is excellent and the documentaries are typical ""behind the scenes"" material.The main reason to watch these shows today is for the nostalgia. The animation and the episodes were mediocre at best. But to a kid, they were golden. I'm hoping my kids will enjoy them.A must-have for 70's collectors!"
5,It's like being a kid on a Sat. morning all over again.,"Only the first time around I saw Hong Kong Phooey on a 13"" black & white tv set with antennas & occasional ""snow"". So it's really great to see these cartoons in color on a large tv. :) I bought this for memories & also to share with my grandkids. They love it & think it's a brand new cartoon, even though I explained to them that this is from the 1970's when I was their age. They love watching this & having me watch it with them. It's fun & special. If you liked Hong Kong Phooey, you will love this complete series. (btw, some things never change: Spot is still my favorite character)."
3,pretty good...,"ive read several books in the smiths/moz vien. this one wont blow your mind but its worth its price. informative, clear and thoughtful."
5,Liquid Velvet !!!!!!!,"I listened to this and was blown away by the powerful, soulful vocals of the singer and the fantastic note-bending guitar. This is a revival of classic sound in new original songs."
1,Even economists smoke crack,"This man lives in a world od distorted reality. Economic equality and poverty is bound to exist reguardless of the mode of production. Capitalism allows democracy, which is the most important issue to me. He talks about Cuba in this book... The have to give up freedom and live in poverty, but their literacy level is the same as our's; which system sounds better? Tjis was a well written book wth ample information, so I probably should have rated it better. However, I hate the message that it sends."
4,Super Silky,"I use this product for my hair, skin, and to make lip balms and I like the fact that it is super smooth and does not have tiny shreds of coconut in it like some of the other oils I have purchased in the past. It is perfect for cosmetic uses."
3,"Good product, but not worth the daily recommended amount","This product requires you to take 3 pills a day (3000mg). The recommended daily intake for coconut oil is 3.5 tablespoons a day. 1 tablespoon is equal to 14 grams. 1000mg is equal to 1 gram. So if you do the math, you'd have to take a LOT of these capsules to get the daily recommended amount. So I'm switching to regular coconut oil that is not in a capsule form.Also, Amazon is screwing Amazon prime members out of purchases unless we buy $25.00 worth of crap with these stupid 'add-on deals.' I used to be able to purchase the product without having to get $25.00 of additional merchandise. In fact, I JUST bought this product less than a month ago and suddenly Amazon decides to have it as an 'add-on' product. So much for purchasing the prime membership."
2,Off Taste,"As the other reviewer mentioned, it does have more of a coconut smell than the other 2 I bought, but it has an off taste to it that the others do not. Reading about coconut oils, someone mentioned the gag factor. I had no idea what they were referring to until I tasted this. NOW's a good name, but they fell short here. You'd be better off with Jarrow or Nutiva, similar price, better taste..."
4,"Great, for what it is","This product is great, if you want to take small doses of coconut oil. If you are planning on taking doses based on weight and need more than a teaspoonful per dose, you might just want to go for regular oil, as these capsules only hold about 1/8 tsp of oil. Otherwise, they are fine :)"
1,yuck!!,"This oil has a rancid, off-putting odor that smells NOTHING like coconut, more like yeast. It also has a TERRIBLE taste. DO NOT BUY!!!I consume a jar of coconut oil a week because I take it as a supplement and cook with it. Jarrow, Spectrum, Nutiva, Vitacost and Swanson are MUCH better. Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh, coconut scent and taste great too.I was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them. The quality, judging by my experience & others', is that this may just be a faulty jar but the quality isn't consistent. I don't see bad reviews from the other oils I use & I have never had a bad batch from the others I have mentioned."
1,Vile,"As a frequent NOW customer, I was surprised at the poor quality of their coconut oil. It was yellow, cloudy, and smelled so rancid that I didn't dare eat it. NOW usually sells good products, so maybe I just got a rare bad batch of coconut oil - who knows? I think I'll stick with Nutiva organic VCO, which has never disappointed me."
4,NOW Coconut Oil,"This has become part of my regular vitamin routine. The softgels are a little big, but I didn't have any problems swallowing them. This really helps curb my appetite. I love this stuff."
4,Not bad!,"This works great for high heat sauteing or use in a wok. However, some things I have cooked don't do well because of the coconut flavor the oil imparts. I would suggest not using for beef. Great with shrimp, pork and chicken."
1,RIPOFF! Avoid this junk,"I had another bag (generic) that works well for my other camera. I thought ""Samsonite"" was synonymous with quality. WRONG! The main zippers are very weak and had a plastic gripper which immediately fell off one of them. Then there is a stiff flap, covering the zipper track and which makes it almost impossible to open.The Amazon vendor also charges around $8 S&H; so it costs almost $30 total. AWFUL!"
4,What u always expect from Samsonite,"I liked the design and the fabric from first look at this nice little bag, I use it to carry my Canon Vixia HG20 and it's just perfect for this camera, I wished if there are more pockets in the bag for my Digital Camera too, but in general,and for the price, i think it's a cool deal!"
4,good bag for the price,"I've had this for over a year and it has been serving it's purpose pretty well. It obviously isn't the same quality as most SLR bags which start at over $50, but it's hard to beat for the price. The strap on mine started ripping a few months after I got it, but it's still hanging on and can be replaced cheaply. It's a great bag for amateurs like myself who just want something to hold a DSLR and don't need anything fancy."
4,"Great For What It Is, But TOO SMALL for SLR's","This bag demonstrates great quality at a great price. However, I just bought a Canon XTi, and I find it far too tight. It fits with my small 50mm lens, but once I get another lens (and believe me you'll have more than 1 eventually), I feel I will have to get another bag. Just keep in mind its more miniature than it looks in the pics!"
1,If I had the product I would review it!,"I would love to review this item! If I had only received it! I ordered from EmallGlobal on March 10th and have yet to receive it!! (It's April 10th) I've e-mailed the seller 6 times with no response!! I tried to enter feedback on the seller but, the system closed me out & wouldn't let me!! I will be contacted my bank to do a charge back on my debit card. A word of advice, NEVER buy from EmallGlobal!!! If they still even exist, that is!!"
4,"Nice bag, but bigger than expected","I bought this bag to use with my Panasonic PV-GS320 Mini-DV camera. It's a good quality bag with lots of pockets. I also like the three adjustable padded Velcro-dividers in the main center section which can move to expand or contract to divide up the center pocket as needed. Or you can move the dividers out of the way and use the whole pocket. Unfortunately, it is quite a bit bigger than I expected. I could almost fit two of these PV-GS320 cameras in the main pocket if I squeezed hard. In fact, the bag is actually bigger than an old bag I was using for my old Panasonic VHS-C camcorder.Here are the internal dimensions (not stretched):Main pocket: 8.5""w x 3.75""d x 5.5""t (without dividers)Large front pocket: 5.0""t x 8.25""w x 1""dTwo side pockets: 4.5""w x 4.5""t x 1""dIf I were to do it over, I'd go smaller."
5,Big,I bought this for my new Canon HF100. And I found out that its too big. But it was not a problem. I put my Canon A610 in the bag together. I liked it because I put all the cables there.
5,One Of The Best CD's To Come Out In A Long While,"This cd is like all the good stuff about 80's metal with none of the cheese. The guitars are in your face, the drummer is sick, the bassist is all over the neck, and the singer is beyond compare!"
2,Difficult to adjust straps,"This car seat is not easy to install even with the instructions which do not explain where the lever is located nor includes any illustrations. The lever to adjust the seat is completely hidden and the seat must be uninstalled in order to adjust it. It is not at all intuitive. Other car seats such as Britax, Eddie Bauer, etc. are easy and very simple to adjust. I was disappointed with the quality of this car seat. I would not recommend purchasing it to anyone. I bought it as second seat for grandma's car but it wasn't worth the savings."
4,Saved our Grandaughter,"Grammy & Grampy bought this new car seat for me when I was 6 months old. Grammy did a lot of research before she brought me a new ride. My mom and I were in a car accident last week and I made it with only a scratch on my neck. My mom was ok too. The lady that was in the back of the ambulance said I had a wonderderful car seat and I was buckled in just right. My Grammy and Grampy want to say ""Thank you Graco"" for a wonderful product."
1,returning this carseat ASAP,"This car seat took my husband over on hour to install and once it was in, we couldn't reach the latch to loosen the shoulder straps. Once the baby was in the seat, it was very difficult to pull the strap-it did not pull easily, it was more of a ratcheting motion where I had to pull and release, pull and release over and over. If that wasn't enough, only one side of the shoulder strap would tighten and the other side was totally loose! I took the seat completely out to try and figure out this problem, but to no avail. I will be returning it as soon as I can and splurge for the more expensive but easier to use car seat."
3,disappointed,"I am a mother of 10 month old twins. We owned two of the Graco Snugride infant carseats and were very happy with them. I was excited to try the next stage. We had no problem installing the seats, however, we found it impossible to reach the harness adjustment strap as a rear facing seat.Your hand will not fit between the seat and the carseat. This was very frustrating in the winter with their puffy coats (especially when you have to do it for two kids). I think this seat will be fine as a forward facing seat, but I am already so frustrated that I wouldn't recommend it."
4,"My small toddler grew out of it, but overall liked it","I bought two of these when my son grew out of the infant seat. Overall, I liked the seat fine, though it was a little tricky to do the adjustment rear facing at first. As far as the straps being uneven, all I ever had to do was pull on whichever side was uneven to even them out, then tighten. That was never a problem for us.I had one of the 79$ model, and one of the 99$ model. The pad on the $99 model was MUCH better, and does not slip off like the cheaper one does.One problem that came up was when my son grew out of the shoulder straps (heightwise) long before he got the the weight and height they suggested.I called Graco, and they gave me $40.00 toward each new carseat I bought (I chose the Ultra CarGo, which I also like, only forward facing though).Now that I am expecting #2, I will be able to keep my older child in his Ultra CarGo, and use the Comfortsport for the new baby.."
3,Good car seat for the money,"We used this car seat while visiting my cousin. My 11 mos old daughter at the time usually uses a Britax, but seemed comfortable in this one. The same problem happened with us, as she was still rear facing. The harness adjuster in the front is too low to access when rear facing. I found myself sweating and mad by the time I was able to adjust the harness tightly enough. My daughter now rides frontward at 15 mos old and we are considering buying this carseat for the other vehicle. My only concern is that her shoulders will be over the top harness slots sooner than she will reach 40 lbs. In this case, she cannot use the seat anymore anyway. The manuals to most toddler seats do not tell you that when your child is taller than the top slots, they are no longer fit for the seat."
2,Rear facing is impossible to adjust shoulder strap - returning...,"The seat seemed to be a good value - solidly built, good price. However, our immediate need (since it is 'convertible') is for rear facing. With the seat in rear facing, I found it impossible (well, more difficult than I'm willing to put up with) to adjust the shoulder strap by pulling the strap that is situated in the front center of the seat. In the rear facing position, the strap and it's release lever are jammed into the seat back of the seat holding the car seat. One other review suggested wedging noodle foam pieces, but I'm not sure that is safe - yes, it will hold the seat out so you can get your hand down there, but what happens in a wreck with that addtl. space that the manufacturer didn't plan on?Seems like a great seat for forward facing."
2,Doesn't Last Long,I bought this carseat for my daughter and it is falling apart. If you ever wash it the velcrow just warpes. I would spend a little extra money and get something better.This one is good... But not Great...
1,Hated this seat!,"My 5 month old has reached the height limit on her SnugRide and I wanted to stick with a Graco product so I purchased two of these seats last week. The seats are being returned this week. We could not get the LATCH to tighten and installing it rear facing makes it impossible to adjust the straps. I called Graco to complain about the LATCH system not tightening and they said I should take it somewhere and have it installed for me. Forget it, my daughters safety is more important to me than the Graco name. I wish I had done my research sooner, I'm buying an Evenflo Triumph!"
2,I am taking this seat back to Toys R Us!,"I bought this seat for our 8 month old daughter. It does not fit in my Bravada rear-facing. It fits great forward facing, but she is not a year old, and just 20 pounds. I don't want to take the chance. Unfortunately I read these reviews AFTER I bought the seat. I looked at all the seats at our local Babies R Us and the salesperson really recommended this seat over the expensive seats. I don't think I should have to buy pool noddles to rig this seat into my truck to make it fit. That doesn't seem safe. The sad part is that my son's 7 year old car seat fits great but ""you're not suppose to use the old ones"".I'm going to take this back and start all over again and spend a couple more dollars for a good seat! A good buy for forward facing, not multi-functional though!"
1,Awful!!,"Do you need anymore stress in your life? If so, buy this seat! After using it for three weeks it is going back! The straps don't tighten at the same time. It is too hard to adjust while the child is in it. Also, the material is poor quality. I can't wait to get rid of it!"
4,You shouldn't have to adjust once it's in,For those that don't like this seat because you can't get to the belt adjuster once it's properly installed - you shouldn't have to. Dress you child in their normal clothes - no coat and fit the seat to them. Then install the seat. It is not recommended to wear a coat while in the carseat because the straps cannot be properly tightened and it's a safety hazard. Because of this the straps should never have to be adjusted until child grows and then you need to take the seat out and readjust.
3,BE CAREFUL - CUT HAND ON INSTALL,Well I just bought this car seat and installed it in my car. It is not difficult to install but when sliding the seat belt through the opening my hand was sliced OPEN on the plastic of the seat. It is VERY painful! They really need to do something about this. The seat itself is fine but I know I am going to be afraid of getting cut again if I have to move it.
2,Had to return this item!!,"I loved this car seat at the store and when I got it home. I thought it was so comfy and nice looking for the money. Plus, it was really easy to install. Unfortunately when I installed it rear facing the strap adjuster is located so low on the seat that it is nearly impossible to squeeze your hand down there to adjust the straps. So after about 15 minutes of trying to put my 6 month old in the seat we ended up having to take it out and put her in her old infant one. Needless to say, it did go back to the store. I think this seat would be great forward facing but if you install it properly you just can't adjust the straps when it is rear facing. What the point of buying the car seat if you can't use it. You get what you pay for I guess."
1,"I HATE, HATE, HATE this car seat","I HATE this car seat. If I could exchange it, I would. It is hard to buckle. The straps pinch my daughter's legs. If you need to adjust the position of the straps, you need to take it out of the car. It is hard to get into the car, and once you have it in, it seems like it is sitting up too high. I HATE this car seat."
2,POOR DESIGN,"AFTER LOOKING AT WHAT SEEMED LIKE HUNDREDS OF CAR SEATS, WE WENT WITH THIS SEAT DUE TO THE PADDING,LOOKS AND OVERALL QUALITY. I KNEW WE WERE IN TROUBLE WHEN MY HUSBAND DID NOT HAVE IT INSTALLED WITHIN 30 MINUTES. (THIS IS A MAN WHO CAN PUT ANYTHING TOGETHER). AFTER AN HOUR OF TRYING TO GET THE STRAPS ADJUSTED FOR THE RIGHT HEIGHT OF OUR SON, WE FINALLY GOT IT IN THE BACK SEAT (REAR FACING). THE BUTTON TO PUSH TO TIGHTEN/LOSEN THE BELTS IS SO LOW THAT YOU CAN BARELY EVEN REACH IT AND I HAVE SMALL HANDS. THIS THING IS BOXED UP AND GOING BACK. WE ENDED UP PURCHASING A COSCO TOURIVA AND IT IS WONDERFUL. WE INSTALLED IT IN 10 MINUTES AND IT DOESN'T TAKE UP THE ENTIRE BACK SEAT."
1,Forget It!!,"My whole issue with this car seat are it's straps. I am constantly having a problem with tightening the straps. If i can't get both to tighten - only one does and the other is extremely loose. Just when I think that I have fixed the problem, I'm at day care picking up my son - and his car seat straps are loose as can be. I sit there for 15 minutes trying to fix it and still drive away thinking that my child would not be safely secured if I had an accident. It's not worth the worry."
1,DON'T DO IT,"My husband and I purchased this car seat for his truck. I have a Britax in my car. Like most Graco car seat products it's really awful to install. I usually get my cardio workout from it which is often since the straps tend to develop a slack on one side because of a horrible design flaw! The only way to 'fix' the slack is to re-attach the strap to the holder on the back of the seat! I usually have to uninstall the car seat completely to fix the problem for it only to reoccur within a few uses. It really bothers me that Graco seems to think that this design flaw is ok and shouldn't affect your child in a car wreck. Yea RIGHT!!Save yourself the trouble and tears and spend the money on a Britax. I promise you, it's WORTH the money! Don't skimp. I wish we hadn't!"
3,Not an easy seat to install.,"I registered for this seat when I was pregnant. I wanted 2 car seats, one for each car. The other car seat was an Evenflow Triumph. My daughter turned six months a few weeks ago and has outgrown the infant carrier (which I loved, and I have a Graco Snugride). I installed this carrier this morning and got so frustrated and angry doing it. The LATCH strap would not tighten down enough, no matter how much weight I put on the seat. The shoulder straps are impossible to loosen, and I can't even tighten them correctly because the seat pulls so close to the car's seat that you don't have any room to maneuver. I am so dissapointed and if my husband hadn't already thrown out the box I would have returned it today. I really wish I had bought two Triumphs or even a Britax. It's worth the money for the ease of installation and adjustment. We might just go buy another seat and give this one to my mother as a spare."
4,"Not The Easiest To Use, But Worth The Money","So far I've only used this seat rear-facing, and I agree that it is difficult to adjust the straps (I have more trouble tightening than loosening), but it is not impossible. One side of the straps does loosen while the other doesn't, but then you just need to readjust them and line the latches back up. My husband can install the seat and take it out without much hassle, and the seat is very cushy and comfortable for my daughter. I feel she is very sucure in it, and putting her in and taking her out of the seat is a breeze."
2,This is a lousy rear facing carseat,"This carseat is a horrible rear facing seat. We had this seat professionally installed so I cant comment on installation. Getting your hand between your the carseat and the backseat is next to impossible to loosen the shoulder straps.When you do get the lever up to loosen the straps, they both dont loosen evenly and when you try to pull the strap to tighten the harness both sides never pull tight evenly. You spend 10 minutes fumbling with the straps before you get out of the parking lotWe owned the Graco infant seat and loved it. The operation of the seats are the same so we anticipated loving the seat but now hate it.This seat might be appropriate in a grandparent's car or for a child facing forward but certainly not for everyday use in a rear facing position.Save your money...buy a better seat."
1,Waste of Money,"My daughter was 6mths when we purchased this car seat. At first I thought this was a nice car seat considering the price. Yet, everytime I put my daughter in the seat she would begin crying and fuss the entire time. She never did this in her other car seat that she had outgrown. I notice the straps would pull her from one side to the other. I tried to fix it, yet it never worked. It also did not support her head. She would wobble from side to side. It was not even a month and I notice a piece was hanging from the side. It had already BROKEN. So, please take my advice, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,hate this seat,"We bought this seat because it looked more comfortable than some of the other car seats in this price range. First of all the straps are terrible. They are always uneven no matter how often we fix it, it goes right back every car ride. To fix it you have to pull the seat out. Its also too big to fit rear facing in a regular sedan, we could only put it comfortably in our van. The straps are also nearly impossible to adjust while rear facing. I know on most car seats they only need to be adjusted occassionly, on this car seat It seems like I am always trying to fix something. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,"well padded and comfy, but can be a bit tricky","Installation is easy if you read the instructions and follow them. Carseats fit in all cars differently, however, and getting it to fit in my jeep grand cherokee was tricky. I had problems reaching the adjustment strap and got quite frustrated at times. Once installed, it doesn't leave much room for the front passenger (I am 5'8""). When placed in the middle portion of the seat, it wouldn't stay in the correct position, the seat is shorter in the middle. I really think it is just the model of my car, not the carseat. I am going to try out others just in case."
4,Saved my son's life,"We purchased this car seat when my son was 7 months old and had out grown his carrier. It did take awhile to install - my car at the time did not have LATCH - but the dealership which sold us the car installed the top teather for free (most of them do this). Sadly my son and I were in a car accident. Not only the car seat, but also the top teather saved my son from injury or worse. He came out completely unscaved while I needed physical thearapy. I would definately reccomend this seat, however the straps did bother his neck so we spent about $3 on strap covers."
1,Not very practical for winter,"I bought a Graco ComfortSport Convertible care seat for my daughter when she grew out of her infant seat and it worked great- I never had any problems. So when my son, 5 months and 17 lbs, outgrew his infant seat, I bought another ComfortSport. My son is bigger than my daughter was and we found it extremely difficult to strap him in. According to Graco, you must use the shorter harness slots when using the seat in the rear-facing position. I called the customer service line to ask if it would be okay to use the longer slots since my son wouldn't fit in the seat. They told me it would compromise his safety. They asked what my son was wearing when I strapped him in. They informed me that it is NOT DESIGNED FOR USE WITH SNOWSUITS! In Northeast Ohio, we have at least 5 months of winter and a snowsuit is a must. Obviously Graco didn't take this into consideration and now I have to return it and find a more practical car seat."
4,Nice!,We purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born. They make a very nice announcement of the new arrival. They are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum.
3,It's a boy bubble gum cigars,"the product came on time and in good condition. I have no complaints.I was happy to be able to pass out the Bubble gum cigars to my friends.But there are a couple of things I wish would have been better.1. The bubble gum is very hard, wish it was softer and chewable but that wasn't the point anyway.2. the box it came in was okay but a bit flimsy. I wish it would have been a real cigar box. It would make a great present in the future to give to the grandson as a memento of his birth."
1,Buble Gun Cigars......real cigars might have tasted better,"I purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson. I should have opted for real cigars, they might have tasted better. These cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew. Not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet."
5,Great Album and great price,I gave this album a 5-star because it's so worth the little I paid for it. it's nice and easy to listen to.
4,Nude photography,"A good book, that helps with lighting, positioning, and how to choose your model. A good bood with good examples. A good choice if you are getting started."
1,The Robinsons,"This British comedy could have been very enjoyable, but all the f-words and sexual content completely spoiled the series. This series is from the BBC, so I was quite shocked. I wish there would have been a rating on Amazon for bad language and sexual content."
1,Not good.,"I would not recommend this to any women how is small down there, and was highly uncufderbol."
4,The occupation goes on,I read Red Gold just after finishing World at Night. The occupation has not yet ended at the finish of Red Gold. Casson has grown wiser and now is more dangerous as he is called upon to contribute more to the resistance. Furst does an excellent job recreating the sense of desperation among the French. In Red Gold the Germans begin to lose some of the bravura that they exhibited in World at Night. The exploits of Casson and his compatriots make for a great read. The suspense is created in a subtle manner which prevents this book from being what I consider a page-turner. Well worth the visit.
3,Not quite up to par....,"Putting aside the fact that he is still one of the best time/place/scene descriptive authors in the noir genre, during much of this book Mr. Furst seems to going through the motions. The heavy drinking rebels, the naive young lover, the brushes with the law, it all seems too predictable. There are no unexpected twists or turns that would have made it a much more complete reading experience. A curious ending, too."
4,atmosphere but thin plot,"this is a good book for curling up with on a cold rainy day. As other reviewers have said, the atmosphere is great. And, also as other reviewers have said, the plot is not very significant. What you get with Furst is: good atmosphere and a likeable hero, who, however, is pretty much the same in each book. Personally, I would would like the books to have a bit more character and plot development, so that it doesn't seem as though the events and characters are basically interchangeable; but the books are entertaining nonetheless."
4,"Great atmosphere, pity about the French dialogue","I've always enjoyed the intense atmosphere of Alan Furst's novels. This lived up to my expectations. Except for the French dialogue that's rendered in French. Random House could surely afford to have the French text reviewed by a Frenchman. Then the characters would sound as French as their ideas.Compris, les mecs?"
5,ANOTHER winner,"I own all of First's work in hardcover, they are old friends, reread at least annually. I can recite most of them but it doesn't lessen the pleasure I get from each trip back."
4,Red Gold,For anyone who likes the pre-WWII era you'll love Furst's books! I've read as many of his books as I can as they all entertain and keep you engaged.
3,Red Gold,"This was a long novel, a bit too long for my taste. Much of the information seems repetitive, and I do not doubt its veracity. I just found it slow and tedious with a minimum of action, and that gave rise to the tedium while reading it. It did not seem to move, although the central character moved all over Europe just prior to WW II."
4,SLOW START---STRONG FINISH,"Takes a while to get the flow of the book, but when it happens, it reads well and fast. A very strong feel for the period and for the normal experiences of people caught in the whirlwind of occupied France.....nice job."
2,"some good bits,average stuff","'would we be alive' and 'shorty's lament' are decent songs, the others are ok. Not much to write home about really. Trivia: Would we be alive was covered by the punk band Nomeansno."
2,For (Residents) collectors only,"This is a 5 song EP (approximately 25 minutes)for almost $10. That tells you right there, BEWARE! If you own (or care to own) much of their music, you already have these cuts. If you don't, it is a waste. Shorty's Lament& Would We Be Alive? are worth the price, but only if you don't already own them. The Residents tend to squeeze every dollar out of their fan base. But who isn't nowadays."
2,disk quality; story quality,"The first chapter and last chapter in the movie would not do a video synch on either to two players on my computer, giving a coarse multicolor changing grid instead of a coherent video. The middle chapters synched and played ok. Keep your warantee?The story was interesting and free-floating. More groupie and poetry than mucicalogical or social justice. If you want her music, buy a music CD."
2,Problem with adjusting harness straps,"I would not suggest purchasing this product, the straps as others have pointed out are impossible to adjust, it too me over an hour to adjust then with the help of a screwdriver and then I was unable to securely put then back in to place one I got them to the desired height. The arm rests are very cheap and fell off everytime my son got in and out of the seat. I used it for one evening but will be returning it, as I just do not feel it is safe."
2,Problem with adjustable straps in the back!,I have always liked Evenflo carseats from infant to infant/toddler and even a booster until this one. I purchased 3 of these that seemed to have had the same flaw. The adjustable straps in the back were very difficult to move upward and when moved the metal lock would not snap back into place on the left side. The lip that holds the piece in was not entirely there and kept popping out. I had checked the manufactured date on all three of them and they all were made in Nov 04. So with that said hopefully the next batch of seats will be better until then I off to search for another brand and see what they have to offer.
2,Not a good buy!!!,"We purchased this booster seat 2 months ago for our 22 month old son. I love everything about it except all the accessories. The cup holder doesn't stay put, the arm rests can get sticky and I washed the pad once and it is falling apart! There is blue fuzz all over it and I washed it alone! The stitching is coming loose and it looks pilled and it's brand new! It looks like it's 2 years old after washing it. I am calling Evenflo b/c I cannot imagine that Babies R Us will take it back looking like that, even with a receipt! I wouldn't but this seat for the fact that that nice looking seat will not stand up to washing!"
4,satisfactory seat,"We have had this seat for several months now and we really like it. It is comfortable and easy to use. I didn't have problems with the adjustments or the cup holders or armrests coming off. I think the key is to make sure they are installed correctly. If you have the armrests over the padding, they will definitly not stay put. You have to install them under the padding and then pull the padding back up. The only thing we didn't like about this seat is that once they have graduated to using the seatbelt instead of the harness, you have to make sure the belt is behind the armrests, unlike most booster seats, because they are detachable. When other people besides myself or my husband put my son in the seat, they ususally don't do that part right. Other than that it is a great seat in my opinion."
1,Looks nice but HARD to use,"We bought this carseat, took it home, had a heck of a time getting our child to fit in it (he is only 28 pounds) had a really hard time with the harness, and adjusting them in the back, I had to get a butter knife to adjust it and then on the left side it still doesnt fit right, I came on here to try to get information on helping me and found this site. I am sooo glad. I read the reviews and for the most part, it seems like everyone has the same problems, so I will be taking it back, I am so thankful I found this in time and very thankful for all the reviews from people who actually used this carseat. If it is this hard to deal with, down the road I would have only wished I hadn't bought it. So thanks to all the reviews!!"
3,I have to take this back today,"I bought the seat based on the padding, the arm rest cup holder and harness.This seat is for 100 pounds. I feel more comfortable using the harness. the straps are too short and the buckle between the legs is way to short. I have no idea how im supposed to use this for the winter. my daughter is only 36 pounds. i don't see how this is supposed to be a booster."
1,Totally disatisfied,Arm rests are flimsy and do not stay secure very well. When placing our 35lb 4 yr old in seat sometimes her legs will brush over the arm rests. They fall off and it is very annoying. Cup holder cheaply made and doesn't stay secure either; it also slants back a little. I am sick and tired of always pushing these pieces back into their slots. Straps don't seem to even out no matter how much I try to adjust. Buckle receiver way too short and close to her bottom. However it is hard to unclick so I know she can't do it and is safe.
2,belt clip loosens over time...unsafe?,After owning this booster for only 1o months the clip which tightesn the belt to the car has lost its grip. We have moved the seat from our car to grandmas two times and its now too loose.If you plan to move this seat from car to car do not buy this seat. The seat jiggles from side to side and is very wobbly in the car..it is obviously unsafe. There is no way to tighten it now.We have to go out today to replace this seat.
2,SAFETY ISSUE,"I found this seat to be well padded, fashionable, easy to adjust, etc. Thought it was perfect. However, my 2 year old son likes to climb into his car seat himself, when doing so, he holdsthe armrest for support. This armrest is NOT attached to the seat, it pops into a plastic hole. He leaned on it, the arm let go and he went flying backward. If I had not been standing behind him, he would have fallen on his back and hit his head heavily on the pavement. The armrest is now broken and cannot be used. A 30 pound child broke this and almost got injured. The attachments are cheaply made of pliable plastic and are easily broken. I have 2 other car seats in my husbands car and my mother inlaws, both have attached, built-in arm rests (both are Eddie Bauer) and have never had this problem."
1,Adjustable Straps a Nightmare!,I just bought this for our 2 year old son -- hadn't even installed it and had a big headache adjusting the straps in the back. I finally had to use a butter knife to pop the buckle out in the back but can't pop it back in after adjusting. I'm returning this seat - adjusting straps should NOT be this difficult.
4,a stellar story of a woman's rebirth,"it's been about two years since i read this fantastical tale of coventry dakin's ""lost and found"" of self. although this novel is about a grown woman it is remeniscent of her adrian mole books in that it's about a person quite lost in the world they exist in. coventry is on the run, but from what and for how long has she really been running? it's a tale of assumed names and identities, of wacky professors and unbelievably dysfunctional families, the suburbs and the city. it's a quick read and a quality one as well. if you enjoyed kureshi's buddah of suburbia or atwood's edible woman, be prepared to jump into yet another world that reflects your own much more than you'd ever admit"
3,"Not as good as the Mole series, but then again, what is?","This, like most of Townsend's work, is dark. There were things that Townsend wanted to comment on that she couldn't do with Mole, so she has made this protagonist a homeless woman on the run. However, as usual she is on form skewering the middle class, the upper-middle class granola crunching Gucci Socialists, and a society that allows people to fall so far. There are less laughs in this book, and there is a lot more darkness. But it is still Townsend, and her fans should give this one a try."
4,House of Spies,A lovely book with engaging characters.... but far too short! It is war time Britain and a local family may be German spies - or not?
1,Plum Not Purple!!,"Good guality tie but it does not look as purple as shown under natural light. If you want plum, it will fti the bill. Returned."
2,Defective Finish on Mirror,"The mirror arrived and the finish on it was defective. It has ripples and lines throughout the finish making it look cheap and damaged. I exchanged the first mirror for another one hoping it would arrive without these issues. However, the second one has the same issues. It is a defect with the way they are made. It is not something that happened during shipping because you can tell that they tried to smooth it out cover it up. I just contacted Amazon and had to request a refund so I can get a quality mirror. I loved the design of this mirror and wanted it for the powder bathroom at our new house, but unfortunately I'm going to have to keep searching."
2,Impossible to hang,"A lazer level is required to hang this mirror. So far I have not been able to find a handy man who has such a level and doesn't want to charge a fortune for such a minor job. If ever I get it hung, I think it will be pretty."
3,Nice Looking but NOT hardwood,"This is a great looking sturdy mirror but it is NOT hardwood, it is MDF or a type of pressed wood with a nice finish on it. I would have given it a much higher rating if it was not represented as hardwood. Maybe the term ""hardwood"" means pressed wood that is now hard??"
1,Heelbo Heel protectors,"The product was not even sent until I complained - after the appropriate waiting period. Then I found that it was an inferior product. (I later got another pair from elsewhere that was made much differently, even though both were made by Heelbo."
5,A Must for Christmas all year long,"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol is a must for any Christmas library. Truly, a great companion read to Dicken's A Christmas Carol. A fun read for all the year. A real Future Classic.Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol"
2,Not what I wanted at all!,As mentioned by a previous reviewer (which I wish I had seen before ordering) this is NOT the book; this is a play based on the book. There is a major difference and I would think that Amazon and its suppliers would note SOMEPLACE in the ads as to what they are actually selling. Are any of the titles listed the original book or are they all plays? Buyers might like to know that information!
2,"This is the play script, not the story","The play script is useful in its own right, but it is NOT the hardcover story I was expecting. If a picture had been posted here on Amazon, the confusion would never have arisen."
4,Loved it.,"As a Dickons reader and enjoyer, I can testify the author has caught the Dicksonian style beautifully. But, I must confess, I've only HEARD the book read aloud on an NPR affiliate. On the basis of that I would recommend it be read by all who have come to love the original ""Scrooge"" Christmas Carol by Charles Dickons. It is ""the same story"" from Marley's point of view. Movement from abysmal greed to heavenly generosity with the help of the 3 spirits and an imp."
4,Hardcover vs. paperback,"I own & absolutely love the hardcover novel version of this story, and was very disappointed it was out of print when I conceived the idea of giving it to family members as a Christmas gift.So I was thrilled to see it available again as a paperback, and ordered 15 copies, without realizing the paperback is a play version (perhaps that it was published by Dramatists Play Service should have been a clue....) The dialogue in the play version is essentially the same as that in the novel, but it isn't nearly as enjoyable a read without Tom Mula's lyrical descriptions of Jacob Marley's surroundings, as well as the internal dialogue of the characters.If you are buying the paperback to stage a production, I think it would be a very worthwhile endeavor. If you're looking for a novel to curl up with on a cold December evening, get one of the used hardcovers...if I haven't bought them all!"
3,Story of Hadith,"The book is mainly about the development of Hadith. Author also tries to prove that the science of Hadith has started before or at least with the Islam and not like some Orientalists think after 2-300 years of Islam. Author explains the classifications of the Hadiths, Isnads and Hadith writers, their life, how they were teaching and spreading. A lot of references are given to each claim so I suppose the descriptions given are real and not fantasy. Each major Hadith writer is briefly described with littel autobiography. Overall it is more like Historical text rather than techinal or philosophical explanations. There is no mention of hadits from Shia sources so it is stricly Sunni origin. Shia sources are as though non-existent so from this perspectiv I did not find it very objective. There is a nice Appendix at the end as a response to Goldziher or Schacht or people in their opinion."
4,"very good, but...","beware, that you need to review the material with a mac os x computer infront of you (in fact that is what they advise you to do). but the most important thing, is to try out a lot of stuff yourself. especially when working as a non admin user in os x. this is not all too well covered in the material.all in all i passed the exam, and the book played a major role in helping. the tech notes at the end of the chapters were a big help too. do not forget to read also another book on os x."
2,not what I expected,"The pieces are bigger than I thought, and the blue plastic that connects the pieces together is terrible. My kitty likes the feather that hangs down but that's it."
2,Fit wasn't very good,"Didn't fit me very well. The back of the neck bunches up and the collar should be tighter. Otherwise it's not a bad value for the low price though the stitching should be better too. So if my main complaint is the fit I should give more detail.I bought a size Medium and have a 15 1/2"" neck. Normally medium sized shirts, sweaters, mocks and jackets work really well for me. Occasionally the chest is too tight but I don't like that Large sized items are so wide in the waist. I've gotten many other medium-sized mocks that fit better, especially in the back of the neck."
4,Great price....great product,"I ordered a bunch of these because I don't like the traditional turtlenecks. I can wear these with sweater vests, a blazer etc. The quality is great, the product is great. How much more could you ask for? Definitely recommend this product to anyone that's looking for some warm clothing that is both functional and looks great.Tim Langanke,Austin, TX"
1,Quality not worth final price,"The list price for this product is 9.99 but they will charge you 3.50 shpping per shirt even when they ball them up and send them all in the same package that cost less than 3.50 to ship. With the shipping added in to the price of the shirt, you could go to Land's End and get a far superior shirt, for the same price. Don't waste your money- Keep shopping."
5,"If I could, I'd give it 10 stars...","I absolutely LOVE this movie. If I were asked to named my current favorite movie, it has to be this film.The music, the mood of the entire movie, the humor, it all works beautifully. Zach Braff did a wonderful job with this picture. He wrote, directed, and starred in this and that is an amazing accomplishment, especially when the outcome is a film as beautiful as this is.I love it. LOVE IT."
3,Very Watchable,"The DVD cover hails it as a coming of age comedy, so I'll think of it that way. It addresses the concerns I seem to recall having as a teenager, it handles everything very well, and I laughed more than once. Yep, I can certainly see it being beloved by some teens.I'm knocking on 50, folks. I saw some bits that were very effective, and some humor that worked quite well. It seemed a bit surreal at first, but that's explained to everyone's satisfaction plot-wise eventually. But my memory of my teen years was that they seemed surreal even as they were happening, no plot point necessary.So yeah, a fine movie, and I'm not even in its demographic."
3,"I liked it, but I just can't give it more than ***1/2 stars","Garden State is a funny, slightly charming comedy about coming back home, finding yourself again, falling in love and letting the emotion grow where it was stopped dead by an event in your past. There really wasn't too many bad things to be said about this movie except for the fact that it was completely unmemorable and its storyline didn't seem to fit into the 102 minutes duration time of the film. After about 80 minutes I kept looking at the digital minute counter on my DVD player. So I guess what I'm trying to say was that it really dragged on.I'll give the movie some credit as far as interesting characters and catchy dialogue go. And there were some pretty funny parts throughout the picture. But this is just the kind of film I watch, enjoy it to an extent, and completely forget about it the next week."
5,Don't listen to the bad reviews...,"...Garden State is a great movie. It's not an ""original"" idea. It's someone looking for someething and finding it. The part that makes this movie stand out so much to me is the feeling of REAL that is in it and the rich performances from the actors in the film. Give it a shot - it's worth the sit!!"
2,Anyone can.....,Write an overly expository movie that takes a long while to say not so much.Braff is funny and he does have some good scenes in this movie but it's like he had a stand up act and decided to build a movie around it.Characters WAY TO CONVENIENTLY COME IN/OUT OF HIS LIFE. He also has the characters go on side trips and endure plot events that are not a basic part of the story.Some people won't mind but I bet there are screenwiters out there who are not stars of sitcoms that WOULD LOVE to get their screenplays into movies that simply won't take the lazy way out of explaining plot and setting up easily comical situations like Braff does.
3,Boring,"I cant believe so many people liked this movie. I rented it on DVD after I saw Napoleon Dynamite (sweeeet) and I thought it was horribly boring. The story itself was interesting and the characters were fantastic. That's the only good comment I can make. Yes, I laughed a few times. But mostly, I wanted to cry because the movie was so darned depressing. Maybe if you are someone who is looking for the meaning of life, this is a good movie. Mostly, I want to laugh and enjoy the movie."
1,"Love Scrubs, Hate This","I got this thinking that Zach's style and humor from Scrubs might be fun to see in a film. I only got 20 minutes into it when it started seeming like the whole script was written as an experiment to see how many times the writers could cram the word ""f*ck"" into each page.I pulled the DVD out of the machine without finishing it and I can't decide whether to keep it against the day I feel far too happy and need a tug back towards 'neurotic' or tie it to a brick and toss it in the sea.If you love Scrubs (good family humor) and you are looking to find that here, keep looking."
5,I'm addicted to this movie..,"I'm a 25 year old male and I love this film. Great music, performances, story.....very touching, funny and sweet. Please check it out."
4,Could have been much more,"Although I give this film 4 stars I was dissappointed in a lot of it. The sound track is excellent and the actors have a great screen chemistry, however the movie leaves you wanting to know what happens and me personally I need closure so Garden State misses out on that coveted 5 star rating."
1,Not as good as they say,"Garden State was a huge disappointment to me. Many of the reviews give it a thumbs up. I have to disagree.This movie is not funny, not exciting, has no plot to speak of, and the characters are one dimensional cliches.Quirky for the sake of quirky, and pointless because the writer couldn't think of a story to tell or how to create any drama for his characters.Like Napolean Dynamite it is a very sad rip-off of Wes Anderson's style, but contains no wit or humor.If returning a set of knives to a store, or riding a motorcycle with a sidecar, or having a person from Africa appear in the film for no reason whatsoever is your idea of comedy, then this movie is for you. However, if you are over the age of 22, and have ever seen ""The Graduate"", ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Rushmore"" or ""Say Anything"" then you will recognize that Garden State is just a very poor imitation which steals from other movies but falls flat."
1,hate it.,"this movie was terrible!there was no real plot, no real climax--no real story.it was one of those hipster movies that people ""like"" because its trendy to watch something abstract like this that makes no sense. it makes people feel more philophical or something.as for natalie portman--she was as annoying as all get out. i am not a HUGE natalie portman fan to begin with--but this was one of her worst performances.i DO NOT recommend Garden State."
1,lame!,"Wow! The only remarkable thing about this movie is, how boring it really is. It is supposed to be a comedy. Well, I didn't laugh a single time. I didn't even smile once! I simply do not get the excitement of many reviews. I really felt disgusted by the main character. I give one star for the motorcycle with the sidecar, which was really cool.Don't watch this movie!!!"
2,Wrong exit,"""Garden State"" is an awkward hybrid of a Gen-Y coming-of-age tale and middle-period Barbra Streisand--think ""Prince of Tides"" or ""Nuts."" That said, it's a pretty pleasant viewing experience until about 15 minutes from the end, when a son-dad confrontation lets loose the tear-jerking and psychobabble to the point that the film's fragile charm is lost. Spell broken, you have a few more scenes to savor Natalie Portman's thespian stylings as ""wacky Queen Amidala in the burbs,"" Zac Braff's bizarrely puffy lips and a soundtrack that keeps things moving but never adds up to much. The DVD extras are painful: Everyone talks like they're making ""Citizen Kane"" or something. I guess they didn't read the script.Is this all you have to say, Gen Y? Gee, this makes ""Reality Bites"" look like freaking Proust."
3,Feels a little flat.,"I really can't quite put my finger on it. This is certainly not a terrible movie. Portman is trying her darnest to work out of her star wars pigeonhole, it's not a awful plot... just that, nothing happens. See Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or another indie movie."
1,"Wow, what a difference a few years makes...","I remember watching this on Netflix back in 2005. I thought it was a great movie, insightful and poignant. Seven years later, I watch it again, and realize how shallow and self-indulgent it is.Obviously, the movie did not change in that time. It must be me. And they say people don't change."
4,Zach Braff does great as Actor and Director,"Zach Braff did a great job in this movie. It is a touching story about an actor who has come home when his mom has passed away, and about his not so great relationship wiht his dad, and a new relationship developing with Sam, played by Natalie Portman. Portman did a great job as Sam, a girl who lies a lot and likes has an interesting life. I really enjoyed the story in this movie and found it entertaining with touching moments and some funny ones too."
5,Amazing...,"Zach Braff has hit his stride in this movie, proving not only his diversity as an actor, but his brilliance as both a writer and a director. This movie has three dimensional characters who you can tell were painstakingly crafted, a simple but extremely emotional plot and a story that speaks volumes in our generation's quest to feel something real. ...And the soundtrack is equally as good! Way to go Zach!"
5,"Weird Is Normal, And That's Good",I loved this movie. It's a romantic comedy with a bit of the darkness and irony of real life. The idiosyncrasies and eccentricities of the characters will make you laugh even more when you realize that they are basically just like everyone you know. It's a good story and a must-watch.
3,For Natalie Portman...,"...who really deserves 5 stars, the performance is that radiant, fresh and heartfelt. What a difference a director makes! Mike Nichols and (apparently) Zach Braff know how to get the best out of her, 'cause here, as in ""Closer,"" she's luminous. (Are you paying attention George Lucas?) As for the rest of the film, this is one more ""Graduate"" wannabe, far too whimsical for my taste (i.e. forced humor), thinking it's saying something about disaffected youth and family relationships, but really isn't. The Braff character is a complete cipher, one whose last-minute change of heart is too little too late. Check out ""The Graduate"" if you want to see what this kind of film really should look like."
2,A bit imaginative,"Same old romance stuff; cliche and mostly predictable plot. The camera treatment is quite good, better than the picture. For those who like romantic fare, rent it. For those who don't...well, you can figure that much out."
1,WARNING - Intellegent individuals read this review before...,"Had to shut it down. its all dialog, absolutely no plot. the movies ""funny"" potsmokers attempt one liners to no avail. Hooray, we get to follow a guy we care nothing about as he hooks up/re-connects with the idiots he went to high school with. If you are still immature enough to get excited and fall in love with a movie just because it shows the occasional joint smoking, this is definitely for you.If you would like to watch a movie showcasing the lives of your local college's ""special, lost, drama kids"" then just bring the camcorder with you next friday night you pathetic indie rocker scum. You will get the same quality of entertainment and mindless banter.garden state is a fickle, or should i say, fecal affair"
3,Hairy & Muddy,Mmmmh...someone saw Harold & Maude didn't they.Not a bad movie....but not a good one either.
2,Ugh....Take it or Leave it.,"Sorry, I just couldn't find the storyline. It was just a bunch of people going around doing ""stuff"".Was something left out? Did I miss something? Did this movie have some meaning I didn't understand?What was the deal with the jewelry locket? Huh? Was the High school friend a grave robber? Huh? Was I supposed to care?Sorry, I just didn't get it."
1,oh please,"If you think that mindless teens-early 20 year olds taking charge of their life is moving than by all means watch this. But if you some how think deciding to lay off the prosaic and find a steady girl friend are somewhat less than monumental life decisions and certainly not worthy of a movie plot then avoid this as though it were the plague. I am a college student and independent movie afficionada, but I just couldn't stomach this one. Aside from a few comic moments, this movie lacks substance and direction. The only thing worse than sitting through all 2 hours of it, was having to listen to ignorant people whose lives are inherinetly meaningless gush over how it's the greatest, most meaningful movie of our age. Ackhhh."
2,Nothing New,"Ok, so this movie is alright. I'm sure it would have been good if it wasn't the same thing that any other love movie has. There is no new, good humor and at the end it's just a sappy love story. Now, maybe the movie would be better if people hadn't told me it was ""amazing"" ""the best movie ever"" before i had seen it, because it definetly IS NOT. If you like corny love movies, or want to cuddle with your honey then i suppose this is a good movie, other than that do not expect too much depth out of this movie. The climatic emotional part isn't even exciting...it's just corny and lame...i say make your girlfriend pay for the movie when you rent it."
2,4.5 stars? You must be joking.,"All I can figure is that the people who are giving this movie 4 and 5 stars saw a different movie than the one I saw.I gave it two stars simply because I found Zach Braff's character Andrew very realisitic. Then again, Zach Braff is a 20-something actor living in L.A. figuring out his life. His character, Andrew Largeman, is a 20-something actor, living in L.A., trying to figure out his life. Not much of a stretch there. But I'll give him a little credit for being a cute dorky guy who actually wrote and directed a film.But 4.5 stars???? No way.Natalie Portman giggles and nauseates her way through this movie, while Andrew walks around in a slightly befuddled state while all around him get high on whatever illicit drugs happen to be available. Yes, I know, he's kicking his own over-medicated state. I get it. It's not that funny.If you are over the age of 18, this movie is not for you."
3,Take a trip to Jersey,"This is a hard movie for me to rate. Its probably more like 3.5 stars. I enjoyed it and thought it was very well made, especially for a first time write and director. There are some very funny moments but it is not hilarious as I've seen some reviewers say. It is a very good character piece that is quirky and odd but not too much so that it turns you off.Zach Braff plays an emotionally disconnected actor who comes home for the first time in 9 years for his mother's funeral. He spends his time reconnecting with old friends and avoiding his father. He meets Natalie Portman's character, an odd girl who he falls in love with. I liked the way the romance was underplayed and yet was integral in Braff's character beginning to come to terms with things in his life. I thought Portman was great in this movie, although the character could be slightly annoying.Overall, Garden State is funny, but not hilarious. It's very well done, if a little too slow in pace at times."
3,It was an ok movie,It was a bit slow. We are big fans of Zach Braff. This is not a film we have opted to watch twice.
3,Fun,It's a good movie. Watched it with a friend. Has a lot of subtle funny things and overall it's intelligent and well done.
4,Garden State DVD,"Quirky, teenage angst/self-actualization in progress, neo-modern classic with an intriguing ""below-the-radar"" approach to touching your brain that has become the calling card of Zach Braff. It's a good movie...almost like a slightly deeper/darker ""Juno"" but from a male central character point of view."
2,Another Puppy Love Film,"Hmmm...just saw this film and was left unimpressed. Watching a 20 something who is lost, finding his way (and it's questionable if he ever does) is less than captivating, unless maybe you are in the same state the viewer is in. His old friends are immature and irresponsible partying 24/7 with no care in the world. One of the film's leads has the most despicable of habits to pay for his drug use. Is it supposed to be funny? The characters are two dimensional and poorly scripted. The whole premise just seems unrealistic, unresolved and unintelligent. If the critics say this is a great movie, maybe it's because they do that for a living. Not a waste of time but close to it."
4,Awakening!,"The first 15+ minutes of the movie had me wondering what I was thinking when I rented it. It seemed to be going no where and I started to space out a bit. I gave it 4 stars because I think they could have had a better way of showing his life before Sam. Could have made it more appealing to watch. I did however like the very beginning a lot. The plane going down, all the chaos going on around him, as he sits calmy. Numb. Great beginning.Anyway...after those first 15 minutes or so, the movie took a wonderful turn for the better. I've only seen it once but feel I need to one or two more times to fully understand everything.Natalie Portman did a wonderful job, leaving the audience to simply adore her and her character.I found the ending to be so cute. This is a great movie for people who feel they are floating their way through a meaningless life. For anyone who has ever felt numbed by their surrondings. And for anything who just wants a great movie."
3,overrated,"While there is nothing overly wrong with this movie, there is also nothing that is particularly good about it either. Its just another twnetysomething angst/finding love story. It has some mildly amusing parts and Zach Braff does a good job in the lead role, but there is nothing really original in the movie. I used to think Natalie Portman saved all of her bad acting for the Star Wars movies, but she is wooden and annoying in this one as well. This movie is worth a rent if your're bored, but you may end up even more bored while watching it."
2,Unlikable characters who all sound alike,"I don't want to say anything insulting about this film, because I don't consider it to be a bad film -- I just didn't like it. And there are basically two reasons why:1. I didn't find any of the characters likable. I didn't care what happened to them. When Zach Braff's character is hanging out with his friends, I was thinking ""If those were my friends...I'd have to get new friends."" Even Braff's character came across as unlikable -- it seemed like he thought he was too good to be there.2. With a few rare exceptions, every character in the film sounds like every other character. You could take any line spoken by a character, and give it to almost any of the other characters and it wouldn't sound out of place.There are a couple of funny moments in the film, but it's not a comedy, and I wouldn't consider the film as a whole to be funny. To me, it was a film about a bunch of characters I didn't like, who all spoke exactly the same way."
2,Scrub it,"The script was good (no Charlie Kaufman, but then again, what is?), nice dialogue and quirky characters. Too bad the performances could not sustain it. Zach Braff mopes around like Ray Romano's younger brother. Natalie Portman gives a poor mans Kate Winslet but falls way short. Supporting cast could have phoned their roles in. Under abler hands, the film could have been okay but when you're director, writer and star, the whole is weaker than the parts (as opposed to a collaborative team like Kaufman, Carrey, and Gondry) unless you are a genius like Woody, which Braff is certainly not. The one stroke of genuis was including the muse himself, Nick Drake, in the soundtrack."
1,Could not finish,"I could not finish watching this movie after the scene where Natalie Portman meets Zach Braff in the dr's waiting room with her big hipster headphones on. Wow, is she unusual. I saw about 15 chicks like her on the way into work today. Stay away from this ""film."""
1,The most overrated indie film of 2004,"Not even the slightest bit of originality ... trite and passe, just what you'd expect from a Sundance favorite."
2,Never picks up speed.,"Garden State starring Zach Braff and Natalie Portman is somewhat entertaining for the first half hour but the movie shifts and suddenly becomes a silly comedy! Braff wrote and directed this film and his performance as a numb Hollywood actor is quite good but he isn't the one who messes up the acting, that honor goes to Portman. Her performance is so childlike and idiotic, you just want her to hide under a rock. The story isn't golden or groundbreaking, the film travels through too many dynamics, I don't even know how to catergorize this film, whiny drama or pathetic dark comedy. Stay clear from this ""it's never too late to go back home"" sometimes it is too damn late!"
5,An Enjoyable Character Study,"I was drawn to `Garden State' by the two leading roles, Zach Braff who I love watching in Scrubs, and Natalie Portman, who has some good performances (most notably in the fabulous `Leon'). I hadn't read up on the film, really went into it blind, not expecting too much, needless to say I was impressed.The plot concisely evolves around Andrew Largeman (Braff), who is effectively `sleep walking' through life, only awoken by the death of his mother. He finds himself at home for the first time in years meeting old friends and making new ones, in particular Sam (Portman). The real key to the film is the characters and their relationships, such as the contrast between the `numb' Braff and quirky-happy-go-lucky Portman. The relationship between father and son is also enjoyable to watch, raising questions on just how much control a father should have. There's no cars exploding, no gun shootouts, nothing even side-splittingly funny, just an enjoyable look into one mans world."
5,More than the Sum of its Parts,"Garden State is certainly more than the sum of its parts. What I love so much about this movie is that it doesn't condescend, by explaining to us every little detail but letting us feel this eerily real couple of days experienced by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. The beautiful backdrops and cinematography would initially make you feel distant and disconnected from the characters or the places you are watching, but the feeling is intentional in replicating the psychological displacement the characters feel at home. You feel at ease again when the story beautifully undulates and cleanly unfolds, again treating you like an adult. The movie is like a great book to cozy up with and a coming-of-age story you will find comfort and commonality in.Lauren Patrizi"
4,braff understands,"if you are a soul that feels a bit awkward, that never really completely fit in, but find beauty in the dissonance/melancholy of life, and yet still have hope . . . this movie can be a great travel companion down that uncertain path of life. it might not change anything but it will keep you company."
5,"Wow, that's all I can say","I first saw this movie maybe like two and a half weeks ago. A couple of days ago I was thinking about it, and I was just simply like I have to see it again. So I went and bought it, and I watched twice the next day. I usually have a very hard time picking out what would be my favorite movies, but I knew this was my favorite movie almost right off the bat.Andrew Largemen is a guy loaded up on antidepressant medicine he doesn't need, living in L.A. a world away from his hometown in New Jersey when he gets a call from his psychiatrist father that he needs to come home because his mother died. While he's at the funeral he runs into a couple friends and the fun begins.It's kind of a coming of age story as well as a comedy and a romance. The performances by Zach Braff, Natalie Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard. Everyone should see this movie at least once, I've already seen it three times, and I think I'm going back to Garden State again."
2,""" Decay of language is the decay of man ""","This is a perfectly good student film.It's besotted with vocabulary indifference.The only people I know of who man-dude-like andf-word this much are actors in films, although I willassume it does go on elsewhere.I'm tired. I am resigning from reviews. I see movieslike this getting five stars -and others even more banal -and realize it's hopeless. We're hopeless. You're hopeless.I am going to watch "" Sullivan's Travels "" over and overuntil I lose consciousness."
2,unimpressed,"The beginning of the movie was humorous enough, but I could barely watch the ridiculously over-the-top dramatic second half of the movie because I was rolling my eyes so much (case in point: ""Hey, good luck exploring the infinite abyss...;"" you see, the infinite abyss is a metaphor for life. Very deep, yes?). Of course, it must be good because it's an Indie movie, so eventually I'll have to revise my opinion to fit in with the Indie crowd (and by doing so become a nonconformist)."
2,What a disappointment!!!,"Being the hopeless romantic that I am, I was so excited to see this movie only to be highly disappointed. The performances by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman were outstanding (minus all of the foul and completely unnecessary language) however, the movie itself left a lot to be desired. The plot was substantially weak and the longer the movie went on the longer my husband and I suffered. By the time it ended we were both glad, though I was personally sad as I had really hoped it would stand up to all of the rave reviews I'd read and seen on television."
2,What's the point?,"Whenever I watch a movie, I ask myself this question--""Why should I care about the characters and what they are going through?"" The answer to that question is absolute nothing as far as Garden State goes. The characterization is so paper thin that I half wished that Sam and Andrew will never see each other again. There is nothing sympathetic about story's hero Andrew. He is just another loser who can't get his act together. His story is not worth telling. Natalie Portman did what she could with her role, Sam. Her presence is the only saving grace."
1,"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH RENT BEFORE YOU BUY:-(","ITS JUST TOO SLOW AND AVG STORY LINE, ITS BEEN DONE A HUNDRED TIMES OR MORE:-("
1,Terrible!,"YUCK! I could not make it through the entire 1 hour 45 minutes. After the first hour, I had to stop watching. It was SO bad. It's one of those movies with VERY little plot. I kept thinking that it would get better. . . but it never did. . . . and finally, I just couldn't take it anymore. If you're interested in death, drugs and dysfunctional families, then . . . by all means. . . rent/buy this movie. . . otherwise, Stay Away!"
1,Disappointment,"I rented this DVD because [1]I have appreciated Natalie Portman in other films. [2]Many critics praised this film. [3]the favorable Amazon reviews outnumbered the negative reviews about 2 to 1. Please add my opinion to the negative reviews. For the reasons why, read those other negative reviews, because they articulate the failures of this film exactly like I feel about it. Maybe if I suffered through the film a second time I would discover some wit or insight that would merit another star---for a total of two."
4,"Not Perfect, But Good Enough For Me","I'm sure the words ""real"" and ""personal"" appear quite often in subsequent reviews of this film.Those words, being accurate descriptions for this film is the reason why this film has become such a cult-fave.No, it's not a flawless masterpiece. And yes, it does, ""borrow"" heavily from other more seminal films (Harold and Maude, The Graduate, Annie Hall).But for what it is, a first effort for a very young writer-director, it is quite good.This is Natalie Portman's best acting since The Professional.It does get a little syrupy in the end, but I think you'll agree, that the appealing nature of the lead couple, earns it.Also, one can never have too many aroused dogs..."
2,Rent - Don't Buy,"Based on the press Garden State received, I expected this to be somewhat of an ""awakening"" movie...you know, the kind where at least one of the characters experiences some sort of redemption, regardless of how major or minor that redemption is.Instead, I found a listless movie about a guy moving medicatingly though a series of life events, meeting an annoying girl along the way. No one ever wakes up...no one even slightly stirs. In a movie such as the classic Slacker, this is the point. But in Garden State, I thought the idea was to show some brain waves.There are some great visual sequences in the film and I give Braff credit for his cinomatic eye. But, if I had to see one more scene with Natalie Portman doing that doe-eyed, grimace crying face, I was going to have to shut the TV off or launch it out the window.Overall, if your curiousity has the best of you, it's worth renting once. But it's hardly something you'll want to add to your permanent video collection."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Sometimes a bit too cute and quirky, Garden State succeeds not because of its gallery of strange supporting characters, but rather because of the sweet and appealing (if somewhat predictable) romance between Zach Braff and Natalie Portman."
4,Good video,Great flick. Enjoyable and worth watching. You will love it. Check it out. Why is the review process such a pain?
2,Garden State :(,"This is one of my very favorite movies...When I found it in ""like new"" condition for $1.98 I had to order it. *sigh* So it arrived and will not play in any DVD player so far, I've tried 4. I have contacted the seller, and gotten no response. I am dissatisfied with this product, and the service at this point in time. If I hear from the seller about returning or exchanging the item, I will definitely update my opinion. But as of right now, unhappy."
1,totally annoying,"This movie started out with lots of potential, but was nothing more than an annoying love story between 2 idiots who bonded over the funeral over a hampster. I thought Zach Braff would have depth since his real kid is sick, but he goes and makes a movie about a white straigt moron falling in love with the same. What a Bore, Zach has the iq of a cabbage and his cutsie boy face he makes gets old in about 30 seconds. No depth considering the source. And get a person of color besides a black person from Africa that a white family ""saves"" Bug off Zack."
1,If I didn't have to choose at least one star I would give this film negative 1000,"I hate this movie. It truly is that clear cut. What do people see that isn't there. What isn't there precisely, you ask? Well, an innovative plot, quality acting, quality filmwork, a unique script, and something worth my time.Everyone reading the hails and praises of this film must recall that the people writing these responses are emotionally void and none too film savvy. It takes little more than taking off a pair of rose colored glasses to see the stink festering underneath this crapheap of a film.Fear Zach Braff. Fear."
3,They make them like this on purpose ???,"I saw Napoleon Dynamite a couple weeks ago. Then, just yesterday I saw Garden State. ND was the wierdest movie I'd ever seen until GS. Now I understand..... they make these movies odd on purpose. You'll finish the movie with a voice in your head {usually takes bout 15 seconds after watching the movie} saying ""What the %#^%$ was that all about ? I didn't hate the movie .... I didn't just like it either. ND had the exact same effect. Theres comedies, horrors, action and drama films. Then theres THESE type films. Don't mean 2 sound cruel but maby, you're supposed 2 watch these drunk or stoned cause they don't make much sense sober."
1,overrated.,"i can't believe people are actually falling for this hyped-up piece of sentimental crap. the story is uninteresting and tired, relying on unconvincing melodrama to try and jerk emotions out of you. the characters are so predictible it's distracting. i walked away from this movie feeling completely cheated."
1,Amazing...,"I don't ever think I've watched a more boring movie in my life. This movie really did put me asleep. Twice. I didn't even know such a boring movie existed.It was stupid, and had no story line. The best part of the movie was the end credits because the movie was finally over. No action or humor whatsoever. 1 star is way too many stars. This movie should be outlawed or burned Indians with torches. If you want to see a movie that will have you laughing, on the edge of your seat in anticipation and suspense, or even remotely entertaining, I suggest you walk right past this movie, and never look back. But if you want to see a movie that will have you stretched out on your bed in a deep sleep, yawning with boredom, and having you thinking about other ways you could have spent your money, this is the movie for you."
1,Dullsville,I watched this movie the other night with my wife and we got so bored with it we just turned it off. After about 50 minutes nothing particularly interesting had happened. There was no drama (the character's mom dies and he goes back to visit his estranged father and he's as listless as someone standing in a very long line for an ATM). It was as humorless as a drive across northern Texas on I-40.
1,Fake and Derivative,"This review will be simple: Garden State is fake, manipulative and annoying.It tries way too hard, and every ""idiosyncratic"" element seems forced and insincere.I hate to offened any reader out there, but the entire time I was watching this flick I had one re-occuring thought:""This is a movie for Tools.""You know those big-budget, well-shot TV commercials for Cars or Cellphones? It's about two hours of that: Vapid and pretty, micro-managed and insincere.The compulsive, overstated attention to detail is obnoxious and trite. The Director and cinematographer are more concerned with framing shots ""well"" than making a decent movie.Skip this one!Cliched, derivative, phoney, forced.If you're in the mood for something in this 'genre' just rewatch your Wes Anderson collection or maybe 'I Heart Huckabees' or even 'Eternal Sunshine..."". Don't waste your time on this drivel."
4,Some folks dont get it....,"I truly enjoyed this movie. Honestly... I even bought it, and watched it a few more times. I guess you have to be at a certain point in your life (in your twenties, I mean) to get it. And I got it. I guess....The one thing I thoroughly enjoyed was how you noticed his attitude about life changed. At first, Largeman was so disaffected and numb to everything, mainly because of his ""treatment"". Towards the end he was smiling and enjoying, and BEING in the moment.The one thing I would have changed was the discussion with his dad about his mom's death. One of the deleted scenes really delves into the convo, and it should have been part of the movie.The movie was great... Watch it again..."
4,playing pg 2,"This game was one of the first I ever played on a PC and I really enjoyed playing it. Due to changes in operating systems and video cards I was unable to play many old favorites until now. the tech support for the product was spot on, some early problems occured but the tech support was responsive and knowledgeable and was able to find a workable solution that allowed me to enjoy an old favorite. I would have no hesitation purchasing products from this vendor again."

5,How Perfect Can Two Guys Be? Another Perfect CD,"These guys never take a CD off - they could slack off or be lazy and drop in a few fillers but nope, they create a high standard and hold themselves to it. It's just genius when it all seems easy and un-complicated ... but all brilliant. Perfect Remixes indeed - tasteful, fun, sexy, intriguing, exotic tracks that work on every level - listening, dancing or be transported ... perfect indeed."
2,Not Impressed,"Sorry to say, I was not impressed. With this book being so new, and so large, I expected more. I can't really say I learned anything that I didn't already know, and I don't consider myself a Macintosh expert. I felt that each of the many topics (the book does cover many topics) was only touched on. I was looking for more depth into each. I am sorry I bought it."
4,Fearsome assault on New Labour,John Redwood exposes the shallow hypocrisy at the heart of the New Labour 'Project'. The government's programme of ill-thought out constitutional changes can be harmful to Britain. Blair is a fraud; this book completely exposes his reliance on the politics of envy. All those who have been seduced by the Labour Lie Machine should read this book.
2,"Nice, Basic Gold... Low Quality Overall","I bought these for one simple reason: they were basic gold earrings that I could wear every day. Nothing fancy, nothing too big. While the earrings themselves are nicely colored and have an even shape, the post and backing leave a lot to be desired. They do not ""catch"" - the connection is loose and unreliable. The post and backing have come apart often. I do not wear them to bed (although I have many earrings where that isn't a problem) and I do not pull on them or put them under any stress. They just aren't made very well. My solution, if you experience this and if returning them is not an option for you, is to go out and buy a package of gold backing from a jewelry or accessories store. Those seem to work out OK."
3,Hidden Allergy,"They're definitely cute, but be aware that if you're allergic to sterling silver, you're allergic to these. The posts that actually pierce your ears, and the piece that actually sits on the front of your ears, are either sterling or some other metal NOT white gold. I'm still waiting for my ears to heal."
2,Doubt if it's really 14k gold,"I have been wearing the pair as basic studs for 2 months (not continuously). The color on the back of one of the studs already turned from gold to brown. Normally 14K gold shouldn't do that. 10K gold would change color easily. Also I'm allergic to certain metal so have to wear only gold or silver. I'm not allergic to other 14k gold studs/earrings I have but with this one that had the color change, my ear feels pain/itchy like when I wear those cheap metal studs."
2,Disappointing,"i guess I didn't realize how small 5mm is. These are a good size for agirl, but a little small for a woman. I don't wear particularly largeearrings, but these are very small."
3,needed to replace a pair...,"I needed to replace a pair of sterling silver earrings & opted for these 14k white gold ones. They're what I expected & would rate them higher, except for the teensy weensy eensy weensy backings. Seriously, visually impaired and/or arthritic baby boomers will have a problem using these. Hopefully I can find replacement ones 'cause I'll lose sight (pun intended) of these wee little backings sooner or later. I like the earrings just fine, they're what I expected. It's just those teensy weensy eensy weensy backings. Magnifying glass not included."
2,Backs,These earrings DID NOT have the friction backs. Ordered in March and lost one within a few weeks. Found it and lost it again. Did not fit tight and only had 1 little lip to catch the back with at the very end.
4,Dainty,"These earrings are very classy, and the perfect size. But be aware that the backs are tiny, and easy to lose. I've learned not to put these on when I'm in a hurry, after spending ten minutes hunting for a dropped back!"
2,cheap stems,"It turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife's ears. I assume that the stems must not be white gold? Other than that they are as expected. Not perfect, but not bad for the price."
1,Poor Quality Earring Backs,The earrings are unwearable because the backs slip right off. There is no friction.
3,Not the Same...,"I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm sizes in the past. I was happy with all, but not with this new pair of 5mm size. These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner. While they look good, the posts are very slippery and the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily. I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost). Otherwise, they would have been fine. I returned them and would not buy this pair again."
4,great value for simple earrings,"These are really lovely, simple everyday earrings. My ears have recently developed a sensitivity to metals other than gold and I purchased these to have a pair of small, everyday studs. My only complaint is that the backings are very small and not very tight. I lost one pretty quickly but replaced it at my local jeweler."
3,Disappointed,"Just received the earrings (white gold). Major design errors. Never seen earring with such short post. If the post is short, the backing has to be bigger as compensating factor to keep the earring sitting properly and preventing it from slipping off the little backing. But the backings are extra small, not just small. It will just be matter of days that the earrings slip off the ears. I should have taken heed of comments made by other purchasers in such respects. The only way to wear this pair of earrings is as suggested by other purchasers: to use other backings which are appropriately sized to hold them.Also, the ball is said to be 5mm, but compared to my other 5mm ball studs, this one looks more like 4mm. That moving display picture is deceiving: not in proportion with the actual product.Otherwise, the earrings are fine. Solid, good shine."
2,Adult Lobes - small earrings,I think these were made for children.... I gave these as a gift to my daughter - and they were to small for her lobes! I think they were mismarked in Amazon... She in turn gave them to a friends daughter...watch the labeling.
2,Watch out for the tape...,"Earrings arrived in good time BUT - watch out for the heavy duty and sticky tiny tape that they run through the opening of 1 of the earring backs. Finally got it off but the back got bent in the process. They're so tiny but tried to fix it. I thought I had and an hour later realized that the back had come off while wearing it. Lost forever. Had to use a spare that I already had. Other than that, these are your basic ball stud earrings. WHY did you have to put that tape there?"
3,"Cute, but still chose to return them","I have a small/medium sized lobe and have to say that they're really cute on but I was really paranoid about them falling out. The backing is really short and the clasps are flimsy and TINY. I have never seen a clasp this small before; it looked almost as if they were meant for baby earrings. Because the clasp was so thin and small, they would move out of place and slide while wearing them. I wanted these for casual wear, but couldn't justify having to worry about them staying in all the time. Also, they didn't feel or look substantial, very, very light in weight and color."
1,Not made for adult earlobes,"It certainly would have been helpful if the length of theearring post was part of the item description.The posts were WAY too short to be comfortable and secureon adult earlobes.Fortunately, I was able to return them for a full refund."
3,cute..backs don't stay!,Cute..stay shiney but the backs are too loose and fall off the posts. I had to use other backs from a different pair of earrings to keep the earrings fron falling out if my ears! I was dusappointed.
2,"Posts too short, lost one in matter of days","These were the size I wanted and they were cute but the posts were very short. It almost seems that these were children's jewelry. Nor did the catches stay in place. I lost an earring within three days. As far as I an concerned, these are not worth purchasing due to the design of the earrings."
2,Very small and difficult to put on,Nice earrings if a bit larger and longer tip so that it goes through ear with room to spare so that it is easier to put on and so that the clip does not have to pushed into ear so that they stay. I had to take them off because it hurt.
3,goldstuds,"I really liked the earrings but they were a bit smaller than I expected. It's very hard to judge the size of things such as jewelry,mhandbags, etc, if you don't see them on a model. But the product was quality and the service from Amazon was excellent."
4,Good for Everyday Wear,"I was going to get the 7 or 8mm size, until I read reviews. I'm so glad I got these. I have tiny ears and they are perfect for everyday wear. The backs are very delicate and my right earring flew off as I was getting a haircut today, but other than that, they are easy, simple and I don't even notice they're there."
4,nice earrings,"comfortable to wear. look great on. pleasantly surprised. also, a little larger than i expected."
4,Gold Ball Earrings,"Great earrings,bought a set for my girlfriend.She loves them! Style glow and style they have are second to none! People compliment her all the time."
5,80's masterpiece,"Another 80's record I did not hear until the late 90's, and a very pwerful one at that! Great covers, from the Monkees (a couple, including an amazing rendition of the porpoise song), to Roky Ericson, to john lennon, to a crazyass chinese version of led zeppelin's dazed and confused! Really crosses many genres, from noise rock, to a twisted rendition of folk, to free form dream-based anecdotes. Butthole surfers-esque, but with less attempt at pure shock value. Some interesting political commentary. Real collage type record, I think I'll go home and listen to it now!"
4,Back in 1984...,"Made in JAP in 2000, Serial# COCP-31219, Playing Time 38:38This live album was recorded way back in April+May 1984 with Niihara on vocals, at the time when their latest album was ""Disillusion"", where half of the songs come from.Even though the disc is short, there's an abundance of energy and enthusiasm that transpires throughout the record to make it worthwhile. The record quality is honest (read ""adequate""), and those were the days when LOUDNESS was making solid and melodic metal (unlike, say, the ""Heavy Metal Hippies"" to ""Engine"" era), certainly before they turned towards a more commercial direction.The record is packaged like a gatefold cardboard mini-album, and includes a small booklet feauting pictures and lyrics.If you're nostalgic about their early days, grab this while it lasts! Who else can make lyrics like ""We are the Loudness guys"" actually work?"
3,Fact or fantasy - you decide!,"Subtitled ""Episodes of a Writer's Life"", Lemady is a fascinating and idiosyncratic fusion of fact and fantasy that records some key events and encounters in Roberts' life. Although, from one perspective, the narrative can be perceived as a personal record, it also features a fictional character, the Lemady of the title, who interacts with Roberts as he remembers. Truth and fantasy are therefore never what they seem; one becomes the other and the reader must decide where real life finishes and fiction begins. Not a major Roberts work, but essential for anyone interested in what makes the author tick."
4,Good Power but Flawed Inflator Attachments,"Seems to have good power. I like the clip-on carrying strap for it. I also like that it comes with a nylon bag that holds all the attachments. However, the inflator nozzle attachments have a design flaw: there is a gap/hole where the attachments link together, so more air blows out of that gap than it does out of the actual nozzle. Which is too bad because it seems like the nozzle would have good PSI if not for that gap. Would have given this 5 stars if not for that design flaw."
4,Solid high powered vacuum cleaner,"I bought this product to replace a cordless handheld vacuum and I am pleased with the results. This vacuum is 10x as powerful as my old cordless and cleans well.Pros: no battery so it won't run out of power, great suction (far superior to cordless vacuums), adequate cord lengthCons: heavy for such a small vacuum, air filter gets clogged quickly and needs cleaned, vacuum gets moderatly warm when in use."
2,Great book - if you're eight years old!,"I mistakenly thought this was an adult book, and based on the title, thought there would be a lot of info about pirates - but there are only two pages.This book would be a good primer for kids who aren't in S.C."
3,Book In Worse Shape Than Expected,The book was not in as good shape as expected. It was shipped in about the right amount of time.
5,A great book,"This is a great book, for sure the best and most comprehensive book on stochastic hydrogeology available today. It covers nearly all the fundamental and practical aspects of stochastic hydrogeology, with emphasis on both the theoretical and practical aspects of the discipline. The language is simple, with many examples and case studies. The book is a great reference for scientists who are familiar with stochastic hydrogeology as well as for students and/or practitioners who may get informed about the discipline and learn how to implement the various tools available. The book is at the same time a very good introduction to the matter and a reference book for people who are already familiar with stochastic hydrogeology and want to keep updated with the most recent developments. This is the kind of book to keep on the desk."
4,3rd disk region locked,"Loved the first 2 movies, but couldn't watch the 3rd because it is locked to region 1.My player/PS3 is region 2. I guess the first 2 were region free."
2,queens girl,Don't buy this they took to long to come and the first disc didn't work and they didn't replace it. Don't buy this
4,thought they were good movies,liked hotel transylvania thought it was cute well made and good for kids pirates where good have seen them all was gift
5,great buy,Item arrived as promised. Quick shipping. Loved the moves. Had them on regular dvd then up graded to a large hd tv and had to upgrad my dvd collection. Well worth the price.
4,The first one was the best,I am not a big fan of sequels but the first one was so good that I could not resist buying the sequels.What we found was that each new one was not as good as the last but they were still very enjoyable.The HD quailty is excellent if you have a screen that can show off how good it is. It almost looks 3 dimensional.
5,pirates rule!!!,"fantastic trilogy, one of my best purchases yet.absolutely nothing to complain about regarding pictureor sound, 1080p all the way to the world's end and back.this trilogy is like a ' black pearl ' - priceless.can't wait for the release of Pirates -4"
5,The Best Picture Period,"Blu-Ray version of this collection is Awesome, the Picture is Amazing and the sound exhilarating. Especially if you own the Onkyo HT-S7100 7.1 Channel Receiver and Speaker Package, the sound is amazing. Amazon Delivered it in less time."
4,Disney Quality,"Disney did a superb job transferring these movies to Blu-ray. The sharp imagery of that format reveals all the little details in the jungle and shipboard scenery that the DVD format was unable to capture. And due to the realism caused by that sharp imagery, you truly feel like you are part of the action. Thus it is well worth upgrading from DVD.Nevertheless, I gave this trilogy a 4-star rating because the second and third movies were poorly written and rather boring to watch."
2,DVD not as advertised,The add stated that the item was both blue ray and DVD but it was only a Blue ray addition. Since I did not own a Blue ray player and had to that dant no need for one was not impressed with produce. Still do not know if it works or not. Will give it as a gift to some one soon.
5,Great Set,"Wow. Just like being at the movies, with no problems with popcorn at $5 a package. I just love these actors, esp. Johnny Depp."
5,Returned the items with no problems.,Purchased items for a gift but the person already had them. Returned the items with no resistance from the seller. The transaction was pleasant.
4,Awsome :D but :(,"I am from India, when i got this set, the first and second part was working pwerfectly fine with awsome quality and sound on PS3, but the third part was a region locked, amazon sended me another set but the problem is still there, so be aware before ordering and have a look on the region code."
3,Region code problem,"Good Day,I had a problem with the third part of the movie, it was in a different region code and could not play on my player, but the strange thing is that the first 2 movies were compatable. ( This is a box set ~!!!!!!)Otherwise, i really enjoyed the service."
3,Different Scan,"Everybody knows each one of this 3 movies is simply fantastic, but Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead's man chest are 1080p, and At world's End appears in 1080i...so my Sony P3 can't read it...This is not an estandar package so be carefull with your Blu-ray player."
1,misleading of customers,"Hello,I purchased Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy (Blu-ray) a month ago. The product came yesterday and I wanted to try all three of them for making sure that they are working. First two movies works fine but when I inserted the third one ""Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End"" I received the error message about regional code. I live in Turkey (Europe) and that's why my PS3 was manufactured for region B. Before I purchased this productPirates of the Caribbean Trilogy [Blu-ray] I reviewed the technical details but could not find out any word explaining regional restrictions. On the contrary, the product information says the disks are available for ALL REGION.I am a loyal customer of Amazon.com but very disappointed about this fatal mistake. If I knew the regional restriction about this movie before, I should not have bought it in the first place. Next time before I purchase something from your web site, I will think twice.Your sincerly,"
1,Package not as promised,"I am a resident of United Arad Emirates and have bought my Playsation 3 from Dubai. However, I do order Blue Rays through Amazon and also check whether they have any Regional restrictions. This trilogy pack, does not mention anything about Regional Restrictions but actually contains one pack (At World's End) which is incompatible to my PS3. But the other 2 films play without any problem at all.I also bought ""Troy"" (which did not mention any regional restriction) and that too plays perfectly on my PS3. My copy of Dark Knight blue ray is on it's way (this too doesnt mention any Regional Restriction) and now I wonder whether that will play on my system !Great disappintment after spending money to get it shipped etc. I guess it is a packaging mistake. I would like Amazon to send me a proper ""Region Free"" disc."
3,"Good movies, but terrible packaging","I like Johnny Depp's performance in these Pirates movie. However, the packaging of the products appear to be a motley of unsold single copies put into a card board box. The 3 blu ray disc boxes have inconsisten exterior print and labeling. I am sure this won't bother a lot of people, but to some it might be annoying. Price is decent, I got it at 49.99."
4,oustanding price!,this is the best price i've seen it for! i mean each blu-ray dvd is probably ranging in the 30's to 40's maybe even more! the picture is great and i love it! ithis is a really good buy.
1,Not for use with multiple staff,"Purchased this for use at a Nurse's Station. Not a good choice for several people to use. Did not stand up beyond the 2nd day, and it had been accessed only 3-4 times a day.Ended up buying a legal-sized binder, with D-rings, that worked beautifully."
2,A Repackaged Collection,I thought I was picking up a bootleg here but it turned out to a repackaged collection mostly from the Fillmore East shows and the Gregg Allman live solo album from the early 70's.
2,Only thing attractive about this book is its 'title',This book is way below standard or has information which is really new. There is repeatation of same guidelines and I am sure there are better ones available around. Dont buy it in excitement because I did and it was a waste of time and money.
4,Well Written!,This book hit all those hard to explain situations to your partner. It is full of very useful information.Excellent book. Definitely added to our bedroom adventures.
1,not much,this is a mediocre book but because it was written by a tv star has been over publisized. there are many better books about orgasm out there
2,Pretty Basic Stuff,"Thought the book was written in a very senitive and understanding form. However, I feel that the contents of it were pretty much basis information. This might be a helpful book for a newly married couple perhaps. I did however, appreciate the authors' own personal in put at the beginning of certain chapters. Thank you."
5,This is what many women tell each other...,"This book is a great way for men to try and understand a woman's feelings about intimate moments.Kim says things that I personally have felt and not communicated and I know for a fact that many women feel the same way.I think every man should have this book and become very familiar with it prior to ever being with a woman. There are intimate things that occur that hamper your ability to communicate after the 'fact'. This book really helps being able to say, ""Hey, here's what I want and need from you...""By the way, the Williamsburg dude - must not understand women, at all."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This review is by a 42-year-old well-educated woman, married to the same man for almost 16 years. Three kids and a dog. Why did I buy the book? Because my husband and I don't know everything.Kim and Mark act as though they discovered sex.The book tells us explicitly what Kim likes Mark to do to her, and how long it takes.Amazing that a publisher would invest in this. (I am certain that it was only because of Kim's fame.)How embarrassing for Kim and her husband! (And their families!)My advice if you want to learn how to have GREAT sex: (1) read the kama sutra and/or romance novels (Really! Millions of women love these books for a reason. I recommend the authors Jane Feather and J.D. Robb (the Eve and Roark series: HOT, HOT, HOT!) for starters -- just read the sex parts if you don't like the rest of the book; and the Red Sage Publishing series) and (2) practice with your spouse. A lot."
2,"OK, Now I've Tried It Out and I've Thrown It Out!!!",Ellipsis nipsis titsis this book is crapsis. HHD>
2,Kids First,"I found the book interesting, but not practical for parents of small children. Their techniques are all about foreplay and lots of it - something my husband and I just can't seem to manage these days."
4,Stimulating book,"Easy to follow guide on pleasing a woman. Both readings and illustrations are easy to follow. Liked the personal stories and reflections, could relate to some. Not a book for women who are afraid to tell their partner what they like, nor for partners who aren't ready to hear it. Some of it may seem outdated and outdone, but there was some new ideas. Geared more toward older couples who are familiar with each other."
3,Satisfaction the Art of the Female Orgasm,"This book was very interesting to read through. I didn't read the entire book, just kind of skimmed through what caught my attention. The author is very candid and expresses herself very well on this topic. I would recommend this book to men who need to learn more about the female anatomy, especially if they would like to learn how to please a woman and become a better lover."
3,Nothing I didn't already know!,"I thought Kim Cattral -- along with her husband -- would write an interesting book about reaching sexual pleasure in more unique and unknown ways. However, I was deeply disappointed with the information given in this book, which does not have anything I did not already know.I don't buy into the whole actress being like the character in Sex and the City bit -- I know better than that -- but I somehow expected cleverer sex advice from this talented actress.There are some good elements in this book, but very few to spend $...$$ on. However, only you could decide if it's worth a shot!"
1,this stuff makes me laugh,"ok so theres people out there that listen to this stuff? although under the far too giddy music i believe is some hooks, but the production sounds like it was recorded under water, and thatd even be cool if this was a good album by anyone other than this guy. this is truly annoying music by all means. the lryics are about god knows and the music is just really unorginal. reminds me of 60s folk recorded by some dude that was tripping on shrooms. this is not a good thing by the way. i dont like this album and i will try my best to stay away from music like this."
1,Very Low Dosage In These...,"Each dose contains only 16 mg of chlorophyll...ridiculously low. Take about 6 of these pills and you'll be where one of the competitors' products are at. Unfortunately, the product doesn't advertise its dosage on this page. Hopefully this helps."
4,Clarity of writing makes topic accessible,"I had Dr Carbaugh as a student at UW Eau Claire, and enjoyed the clarity of his lectures. His book is nearly as good. My (first) edition is still worth consulting when I have the opportunity to teach econ."
4,Great book,This was required reading for my last undergraduate classes. Probably the best book on economics ampong my required reads as an economics major.
3,Good Book,I ordered this book for an International Economics class I am taking on-line. This is a good book with very valuable information.
4,Old cookbook,"This was a cookbook my friend had, and there were several recipes in it she used, notably some great salad dressing recipes, and so I decided I'd try to find it, and of course, Amazon had it! Thanks, and, by the way, I've used the recipe that I wanted it for! It was in great condition for an older book and I've enjoyed trying out the blender recipes."
3,Did not perform as advertised,I have LONG wanted this set - and especially searched to see that it was closed captioned - it said it was on your site - and on the package itself - but alas - no closed captioning..and since I have some major hearing issues - this was a major let-down. I have been able to watch the DVD - and catch about 70% of the dialogue (it's a blessings I guess that Elizabeth YELLS so much)
5,Magnificent.,"I happened on this series on Netflix streaming. I have since watched it over and over, and now that it will be taken off Netflix streaming I will be purchasing the DVD set. One of the best historical miniseries I've ever seen, and well worth the watching."
5,Costumer's dream,I bought this before ever seeing the series and I must say I couldn't have spent my money any better. This is so beautiful to watch and the acting is right up there! The historical comments are great and the special features are interesting. But I got this for the costumes and my god are they amazing. I already have several classes to teach based off several dresses found on these DVD's. Well worth it!!
3,long and boring,it is loooooong and boring. which is probably closer to the truth of the situation--like not every day of life is filled with exciting experiences. But it was like watching an Mary Hartman. the acting really bad and so are the props. Maybe for real info it might be ok but for entertainment. well......
1,Disgusted!,"First and foremost, Glenda Jackson is too stern to play Elizabeth in her youth and every time she speaks, she is stern! This is very annoying when she makes her speech in the Spanish Armada. This movie makes the actors talk on and on, and it BORES me to death. Only The lions cub was decent enough but then it- only shows Jane Grey twice! And why doesn't it show her going to the block when it can show Mary Stuart and Robert Essex!????"
4,A Special Gift,"This is a special gift shared with someone who enjoys this series like comforting familiarity. We have watched the familiar episodes noting quality costumes, serious dialogue, humorous inserts and sweeping stories. The performances are both on the mark and attention grabbing. This series was significant when first broadcast (before personal possession, no Cable, no VCR, no DVD, no Pay Per View, no Blue Ray) and it retains it's relative luster.Great to see it available for consumption on my time."
5,Great Show,"First show I remember of Elizabeth I. Captured my interest as a child. I know it seems ""old"" compared to whats out today, but it is a great production."
4,Great drama of Elizabeth I's reign,"""Elizabeth R"" is a great masterpiece detailing Elizabeth I as an authoratarian ruler of England, greatly shaping its culture, reigning as a popular ruler. People who try to control are naive because they think she is weak due to the fact she is a woman, something that they are sorely mistaken about. Glenda Jackson takes charge of the lead role as the Virgin Queen the same way that Derek Jacobi takes charge of Claudius in ""I, Claudius,"" the series that shares, with ""Elizabeth R"", the title of greatest drama in ""Masterpiece Theatre"" history. Jackson plays a hard queen who has a great sense of duty to England and wants to change it, but for the better. Naturally, she runs into her share of adversaries and wanna-be puppeters. The queen triumphs in the end in a big way, and Jackson and the brilliant writing help the series to be a tour-de-force. The DVD looks to be promising, certainly more promising than the ""I, Claudius"" DVD."
5,Good compliment to Cal/Mag supplement,"On the recommendation of a nurse practitioner and later my nutritionist, I take this to compliment the Cal/Mag supplement I take. I have osteoporosis and am trying to do everything possible to keep my bones strong. (I also take Fosamax with vitamin D). In addition, I take biotin, which my nutritionist said might strengthen my fingernails. It definitely has, or at least the combination of all I'm doing has done that! I was never able to grow them out at all before. They always broke and were quite thin. You should see them now! I have found TwinLab to be a good company over the years and the biotin I take is their brand as well.TwinLab - Tri-Boron, 3 mg, 100 capsules"
4,Tri-boron,"Twin Lab has always been a reliable vendor, I am very content with the product and recieved with in the est. date of arrival."
5,An Inside View,"It was interesting to read a child's inside view of life in a Rajneesh commune ~ several, actually. I once was a Sanyasin, so I can relate to all that is shared. It's very informative, and like reading about life on another planet in some ways."
1,Could this be any more boring,My wife encouraged me to read this book because of the great reviews. All I can say is that this is a complete snooze. I have been reading it for nearly a month because I fall asleep after 10 pages. It seems like it could be a lot more interesting if he got into some of the darker stuff that takes place on the communes. All we get to see is a bunch of bored kids running free because their parents are off doing god knows what. I'm giving up at page 200 on moving on to something else!
2,Not Worth the Effort,"I'll be honest -- after reading 50 pages of this book, I got off the StairMaster at the gym, put the book in my bag, and had no interest in reading any more of it. It just wasn't that interesting. It read more like a history of the Bhagwan Rajneesh, and less a story about Guest's childhood experiences. If you want to read about horrifying childhoods or kids in cults, try ""Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress"" by Susan Jane Gilman or ""Running with Scissors"" by Augusten Burroughs. Either one is a more entertaining and less laborious to read."
3,Rell can do better,"This is ok, I like to hear Hell Rell rip tracks but some songs, I just couldn't vibe to it due to some lame beats, and I tried. But paperboy was a head banger, Hardest out, and a couple others. But I would only recommend it if your a fan."
5,Warm and Comfy!,These are the most warm and comfy boots I have ever purchased. I can't wait to wear them again next winter!
2,FAKES,"Returned this pair of ""UGG"" boots because by internet findings, they were stamped made in ""austrailia"" which the REAL UGGS are now made in China. Certainly had me fooled when I ordered until I examined closely upon receiving item. No problems with customer service and refund appeared promptly."
3,So small,"Used it for mixing and (after) applying henna. It worked for what its worth. But, it was only able to help me with 2 henna tattoos. The result only lasted about 1.5 weeks. My main gripe is that its so small. Its smaller than my pinky (diameter and length)."
2,Beachcombers Myrtle Oil,SO so. The oil is ok but it does not have a pleasant smell. Kind of like the scents used in a public bathroom.
5,Good bonus tracks,"""The Rare Piaf"" is chiefly a collection of English versions of some of her tunes. The real prize on this CD, however, is the pair of c. 1962 studio sessions. The first is some 22 minutes long. You hear the orchestra alone practicing, then Piaf attempting the song multiple times and you can also hear her lauhging with or barking at the musicians or directors. The English tracks on this disc can be obtained on other compilations, but this one is worth getting because of the bonus tracks."
4,Close But No Cigar,"I have a Columbia Records album titled ""La Vie en Rose"" from the 50s with a picture of two lovers on a bench kissing on a Paris street. This album features Piaf singing completely in English. A few of the songs on Rare Piaf sound alike, but are obviously different takes?!?! The album I have has far superior versions of these songs with better vocals and instrumentation. So I'm patiently waiting for Columbia to dig into their vaults and come up with the wonderful takes I'm used to from my fast wearing vinyl."
4,Great for New Edith Piaf Lovers,"While this Cd does lack some of Edith's trademark French zeal, it is still a joy to listen to. This is the perfect CD for those who love Edith Piaf but may not be french music connoisseurs. It is full of passion and the voice that can only come from Edith Piaf."
3,Cute pillow,Cute pillow but smaller than I thought it was going to be. Went well with my son's shark themed bedroom. Washed real well after the dog threw up on it.
4,another fine Indian novel involving a family,delightful and fascinating story. Ms. Badami (like many of her countrymen and women) have that ability to present a wonderful and engrossing story of a family dealing with the vagaries of maintaining dignity and a semblance of pride in the highly corrupt culture and society that is Modern India. Well paced and reminds me of many of Rohinton Mistry's books.
2,Boring characters and plot,"Off all the many novels I have read about modern India this is the most disappointing. Paragraph after paragraph of numbing detail about daily routines, petty arguments and family disapproval wear away at the otherwise sensitive depictions of the familial roles and expectations that this family burdens under. The characters somehow never really emerge as real people, although the multi-generational theme is tied neatly together. This book was slightly reminiscent of the book Palace Walk set in old Cairo, but which was vastly superior in cultural depictions and well-drawn characters you could either care about or despise. The characters in this novel seemed two-dimensional and passive."
4,Fun story about an middle class Indian family,"This book is a light read. I would probably have not read it if it were written about an equivalent western family. The insights into Indian family dynamics make the story more interesting from the point of view of a person unfamiliar with the culture. Badami gets us to understand life of a middle class Indian family. The story is colorful and fun. Badami does a nice job of character development. At some point the father ends up going to Vancouver, Canada and bringing back his grandaughter back to India to live with the family. The contrast of life in India versus Vancouver is certainly interesting from the grandaughter's point of view.This is not particularly fine literature, but a worthwhile read if you are interested in Indian culture especially."
5,a hero walking,"ever read. The depth of understanding of human emotion and angst was impressive, especially as all the characters had to face their roles from what is expected from them as following old rules of behavior and bending and fitting them into more modern rules. The part where Nirmala finally asks herself why she This is one of the best Indian authored non-fiction books I have never thought to question listening to mother-in-law, husband, without thinking about what SHE wanted is where most of end up finding ourselves at some point in life. The characters were explained and developed that I could recognize them as real people who were finding their way in life as it unfolded to them and still carrying on. I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK."
2,told not shown,"While I really enjoyed Badami's first book, The Hero's Walk proved cumbersome and tedious. The plot lacks any creativity. It plods along at a labourious and predictable pace. The reader is ""told"" rather than ""shown"" everything feeling, thought, emotion. Pales in comparison to Such a Long Journey by Rohinton Mistry."
3,(3.5) A family: from boredom and despair to hope....,"Peopled with an insular Indian family, this deceptively simple novel allows the reader to peek behind the scenes of everyday familial interactions. This family has moved through the years almost by rote, honoring the old ways and accepting the mundane pattern of their lives.Meanwhile,across the ocean in America, tragedy strikes and an orphaned child appears on their doorstep. This helpless little granddaughter is the catalyst that finally propells the family into the future. In contrast, the great-grandmother tenaciously clings to the past, ever more self-absorbed as her worst traits define her final years.In order to survive, family members redefine their roles, charged with a renewed sense of interest. To nurture the child, they must open themselves to the future, and become more tolerant of eachother in the process. Ms. Badami writes with a straightforward charm, unpeeling the intricacies of her characters layer by layer."
4,A Reporting Bible!,"Clear, practical and concise coverage of almost every reporting topic and technique. Chock full of examples and side bars, beginning to advanced users will find something worthwhile in its pages. Coverage of popular reporting tools such as Crystal Reports and Active Reports prove informative, but more informative, interesting and cost effective yet was the discussion on using the ubiquitous Microsoft Office as a reporting tool from VB6 and VB.NET. I found the authors' advice on creating general purpose criteria screens for reporting, invaluable in several of my consulting projects. If you want to weigh your reporting options, become a better report smith, build a reusable reporting library and impress your clients, buy this book!"
1,Hysterical.,"Written as a series of numbered soul-scouring diary entries, this weightless volume links metropolitan gay American life in the 1970s and 80s with American grand opera's obsession with class, and as such belongs in the cultural anthropology section of anyone's library. But having expressed the link, it bathes in it and rolls around in it, and expects the reader to sympathize, without substantiation. It is its own indictment."
4,Great Harness for Heavey Weight Battles.,"This harness is a must have if you are playing woodsball. It has 6 places to put your pods. This amount of ammo can last you three or four games in a row. There is also a pouch for a co2 bottle. Now since it has a pouch, you can put a line remote on your bottle to your marker. This helps by preventing you to carry a heavy bottle. But the bad thing about this is that it is wide spread. The pods stick out a little bit and it is kinda hard for me to sit down in my computer chair. So being that, you can't squeeze in between obstacles. And if you are playing tactically, you can't turn as easily around obstacles. Also, it is kind of heavy with a bottle and full ammo pods. With all this, it will be hard to play speedball with this heavy harness on."
1,All nicked up!!!,"It looked like somebody dragged it on the road before it was shipped!! Unfortunate for me, I cannot use it!!"
4,Good Deal,The alumunim tubing arrived just as expected. It was packed well and met all expectations. I would glady purchase from the same vendor again.
5,This book simply rawks!!!,"The content in this book simply rawks - all the latest information on how you can do web services using PHP.There is a wealth on information on how you can use PHP and SOAP (using popular libraries such as NuSOAP, PEAR::SOAP and ezSOAP), PHP and SOAP's front-runner (XML-RPC), how you can discover web services using UDDI. Infact, there is a quality library for PHP::UDDI, that was created for the book, and which the authors have very kindly hosted on sourceforge (phpuddi.sourceforge.net/).This is *the* book on the subject. Check it out today."
1,Save your money.,"Cheap, cheesey ........... you get what you pay for. I sent it back. Incidentally, I ordered it from JAF Gifts and when I contacted them for the return, they told me I'd have to pay a ""restocking fee."" I informed them that I didn't recall any mention of a restocking fee when I bought it and would not pay it ... they relented of course, but then I still got stuck with the shipping ... twice. Save your money."
5,Beautiful album,"This album may not be available in the US stores, but it is widely available in Canada, which is where I bought it. This is truly an album of beautiful songs, that run the gamut of all kinds of love, and their respective feelings. 16 strong, powerful ballads as only Chris De Burgh can do them. 3 of the songs are new, while the rest have been pulled from previous albums, although 3 of those have been newly recorded, while ""Lonely Sky"" is a remix. An exceptional album, and the booklet contains all the lyrics. A must-have for all those romantics out there."
5,Lady In Red,I am thrilled I was able to find this CD. Many markets are not selling it anymore and Lady In Red is a favorite.
5,One of my favourites,Most of CdB's wonderful love songs on one CD - I consider this an excellent addition to my collection.
2,Fine when it works,when it works its fine but that is only about 1/3 of the time. it only works for 2 hours on a full charge which takes about 24-36hours. also the part where you insert the dvd is way too easy for a 20 month old to get into.
1,Never worked right,"I got this RCA DVD player because I've had other RCA products in the past and was, overall, satisfied with them. This player did not work correctly from the start. The speakers do not cut off when I plug in the headphones and the headphone jack has to be jockeyed around so both sides work. No satisfaction from RCA when I brought the problem to their attention. I bought this for use on planes but I can't use it for that. I use a Zenith on trips and it has worked fine for nearly a year now. The RCA stays home and entertains me on the treadmill but I really didn't need separate players for home and travel. Also, you have to use the remote to do very much because the controls on the unit are so limited."
1,Broken,"I searched long and hard for this, read reviews and felt this would be the perfect gift for my 15 year old son for his birthday.I charged the battery and wrapped it up and it never worked. The door was closed but the player said it was open, therefore would not play the dvd.We sent it back. It's basic feel was cheap and plastic like. We don't know what the picture quality was like because it never worked."
3,Heavy and Dull-Pointed,This fork is heavy to hold and the tips of the fork are dull.I do not like it for turning bacon which is why I bought it.
2,Doctor Schweitzer.,"I don't doubt that he was a great doctor and ethic but the book traces scholarly doubters, mostly German theologians, to the end, which was a bit stiff reading. Obviously, he and they were considerably smarter."
1,The Quest of the Historical Jesus,I found this to be excruciatingly boring. The material is at best obsolete and of little value. A waste of time and money and not appropriate to one searching for a history of Jesus.
5,"A MUST for theologians, pastors, & serious Christians","I don't think the above review understood the central theme or the historical importance of this monumental work. Fortunately, Mr. Price's eloquent review (below) explains Dr. Schweitzer's theme well: that most theologians who attempt to reconstruct the Gospels & the life of Jesus are simply projecting their own values onto the subject. The result is a normative portrayal of a ""Christ of Faith,"" NOT a ""historical Jesus."" In fact, the ""real"" Jesus recedes into historical background as the authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke, & John also project their own values & interpretation onto Jesus' life. Who is Jesus, then? That is a question of faith, not a question of history."
5,"Albert, I hardly knew you!","This is a most erudite and methodical analysis of the lives of Jesus written in the 100 years or so before and during Schweitzer's life, many of them by German writers. It's a book for those interested in delving into the thinking of that time period about Jesus, and in understanding better how we arrived at our current view of Jesus."
2,Not very energizing,"I have two experiences with Roy Clark live: a great 8-track of him performing in Las Vegas during the '70s where he tears it up musically and this CD which doesn't quite generate the same excitement.Hey, if you are a Roy Clark fan, this more recent performance is probably par for the course, but it fell short of the tremendous musical experience he produced twenty years ago for me."
2,Roy Clark Live,"I also liked the show in Vegas better. I still have a 8 track player and 3 of Roy Clarks 8 tracks. I also have 3 of Roy Clarks CD's. In trying to compare the CD against the 8 track, I had to take in consideration that the 8 track was 11 minutes longer. That Roy seemed to have more fun, but he was at Vegas where they expect the stars to be more outgoing. I will continue to buy the new CD's, but still play my old 8 track."
4,Excellent,"Took a flier on SpecialTeas.com and i am very happy. Came within one week packaged in mylar resealable packages. My previous experience with this has been at high end tea outlets. Fragrant, excellent tasting. This surpassses my previous experiences. I suppose I gave it only 4 stars because I want to leave room for a Nirvana tea experience (but this one was excellent)."
3,"A Paris, w/ Yves Montand","If you are an Yves Montand beginner or a French music starter, this will not meet your expectation for absorbing the sense of ""Paris"" and its loveliness. There are, however, a few familiar songs like C'est Si Bon, A Paris, Les Feuilleur Mortes, etc. that will offset for the less soul touching tunes and will give you a nice sensation of being in Paris. For the Yves Montand's fans, the voice is warm and his taste in presentation is charming."
3,Very Good CD. Not as good as Rue St. Vincent from Rushmore.,"I bought this CD hoping to get more songs like Rue St. Vincent, which I heard on the Rushmore Motion Picture Soundtrack (get that movie and that DVD!).This CD is still very good and songs are mellow and romantic, but none quite so mellow or romantic as Rue St. Vincent. If anyone knows where to get that song or others like it, please post it here."
4,No longer quite so dangerous however...,"Of course these stories aren't as ""dangerous"" or revolutionary as they were when they were published 35 years ago. The culture and SF have evolved quite a bit in that time. That said, its still a pretty good collection of stories, and even more interesting as a piece of SF history.Harlan Ellison deserves a lot of credit for preserving this book as it was, resisting the temptation to update it (like certain directors have futily tried to update their older movies). This includes his introductions, which are written in the venacular of the time, dig, (and which less secure writers might have been embarassed by). To be honest, I found them the most entertaining part of the book, and they give the reader a great insight into the time in which they were written."
3,Not bad for the price,"For the price its a decent gift. They do lead you to believe that its an actual stone when in reality, it is not. Its more like a plaster."
5,pleased,"item came in the time they had said, the packaging was not the best though, it just had cardboard wrapped around it, but still in good shape. over all i was pleased....."
5,"Great, even if you are not a full time pro","I ""discovered"" Stabila levels while helping a pro do some work on my house. After a few days of use I ordered my set and am very glad I did. As I continue on my projects this set if perfect. From doors and window to other general uses these tools are great. I recommend getting the case. Your other levels will fit as well (my old 4' fit in one of the extra sleves). I've been using them for over six months, a lot, and they are still in great shape and most importantally, accurate."
1,"i like a warning about certain things, myself.","Those who enjoy reading certain things should be free to do so , of course, but it would be nice if the rest of us had some idea before we spent money and wasted time. I don't know how the rest of the book turns out, but some potential readers might like to know that this 'literary' sounding book, once you get past the first few pages, has graphic refences to hermaphrodites, lesbians and things of that nature, using some truly filthy language. If that's your taste, as I said, well fine, but I won't be finishing it and I am sure that there are others out there who would like to know this BEFORE they buy it."
5,An Evening with Dorothy Field,"I had heard of Dorothy Field for many years, but this recording is the only time I have actually heard her. She is a dynamic personality, and her remarks about several people who made TIN PAN ALLEY were among the highlights for me. Not the best vocalist, but what a talent! I couldn't help but renew my love for her with this recording!Dwayne Brittain405 E. Chestnut Ave.Duncan, OK 73533"
2,Front Custom Floor Mats,The mats shown in the ad vs the mats I received are not the same. As I indicated in an earlier review the mats shown have eyelets for securing to the floor of the vehicle. My car 2010 Cadillac DTS has the catches in the floor for the mats with the eyelets. The mats I received do not have that feature. They tend to move and not be stationary.
4,all the bass you need,I am a dj and i play this cd at a lot of partys and people love it. Also if you have a huge stero in your car this cd will put it to the test.So in the mood for the heavy bass this is the cd for you.
5,Quite a few good ideas here! I'm impressed.,"I got this book because I plan to be travelling in the fall, and I wanted some ideas for things to make my travels easier. I love the ""poncho which folds up in its own pocket"" idea, as well as a warm wrap that would be just what I need for staying comfy on the plane, some slippers that would be perfect for travel, ideas for adding pockets to ready-made clothes, a ""purse/necklace"" great for carrying a credit card and room key, ideas for simple scarfs which will stretch my travel wardrobe, ... well, you get the idea. (I also orderd by the same author a book on Travel Accessories to sew, but that hasn't arrived yet. If it's anything like this one, I'm sure I'll be pleased!)"
5,Just wonderful,"Full size patterns. Need i say more? But i will anyway.The accesories and bags are done in a more matronly style than i like, but i used my own funky fabrics, etc. and was VERY pleased with the ease i which the projects were completed and the adaptability of each project to my particular vision.And, full size patterns. With handbag patterns selling at [price] and up, i saved a ton with this book. Good for the beginner or those looking for instant (or as instant as this gets) gratification. Clear and concise instructions."
5,Amazing Book,"We love to eat Chinese food. This book offers an array of good recipes that are laid out in such a way as to make it simple for anyone to achieve great, effortless dishes. This is my second copy of this wonderful book, my dog ate the first one - I'm really telling the truth. I guess he realize how good it was too!"
3,"Well,More Like 3 1/2***","Warning From Stardust is an alright album,but if you want to get into this great Japanese rock band,seek out their earlier work like Signal Fire or Super Live,or even the superior Asian Volcano which is actually available on CD also. Warning From Stardust finds the group working toward a more commercial direction and is neither as heavy nor creative as their earlier efforts. Sort of like comparing Kiss 'Alive' to 'Dynasty',or Priest's 'Sad Wings Of Destiny' to 'Turbo',but Stardust is probably much better than either of those bands' later albums."
5,A very good introduction and view into the Fashion Business,"I not only learned alot from reading this book but actually enjoyed the reading considering it's a text book. As someone who's trying to get back into the fashion industry after a 20 year hiatus; I feel that I have the knowledge I need to head in the direction I want to go now. I really liked how they used real companies for examples and at the end of each chapter they have an explanation of a job in the industry with comments from people in those jobs. There's lots of charts, lists of important contacts, calendars of events, etc that will be important to anyone starting a fashion business or wanting to find a job in fashion. It's worth the money if you can't afford to go to school for this."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Never buy anything from Poster Revolution, I ordered and paid for a poster ""Le Baiser de l'Hotel de Ville, Paris, 1950"" from them on September 11, 2012. I waited patiently for 3 weeks before emailed Poster Revolution to inquire the where about of my poster. They never bother to reply, I emailed them again about a week ago, I still haven't heard from them.... If you have money to waste go ahead and buy from them.... I regret that I order from them..... If I wasn't forced to rate them before I can post this review, Poster Revolution deserves negative 5 stars."
5,Marvelous..One of the finest novelist of our time!!,"Ms Pope's lyrically brooding new novel...One has to accept the characters of ""The Colored Waiting Room"" as generalized figures moving in your mind, an authoriative and memorable picture of a Black woman's life. Very compelling blend of experiences...true to life, I certaninly cheered Alberta on, and cried for her at the same time..Ms Pope captures that almost indistinguishable mixture of love, personal weaknesses, and vulnerability."
4,101 reasons i liked 101drills for defensive backs,"Whether your a coach looking for some new drills to show your players, an offseason athlete looking for ways to train and improve yourself, or just a football fanatic who just loves the game and wants to know more about it,you'll want this book. 101 drills for defensive backs shows drills to improve your strength, speed, agility,and technique to become a better defensive back. There are various drills for strength and condition that every defensive back should use. Being a defensive back myself, i totally recommend you buy this book."
3,Incomplete CD,"This was originally a double vinyl album, and the CD is missing some of the best Poet-period stuff that was on the original. To answer an earlier question, it was recorded at the Hackney Empire in London - a wonderful old-school music hall and very atmospheric, as can be heard here. I love it but just wish that all the original tracks had been included. Maybe the complete version will go on sale as a download at some stage."
1,They sent an Oval,"Oval is not what I wanted and was useless to me. I contacted 4 times by email, 2 by mail and 6 by telephone, but to not avail."
1,This was once a black metal band?,"This release is rather amusing. In fact, all of Cradle of Filth's recent releases have been amusing. Was I interested in the music at all? The answer is no. It is amusing in the fact that the band has sold out. The fact that they're popular isn't why they have sold out. They sold out because they quit playing black metal to avoid negative attention from the media and parental groups. Midian, in addition to all of their recent offerings, sounds more like a gothic metal (a genre which has no appeal to me whatsoever) band such as Tristiana than any black metal band. They were mediocre as a black metal band and now just continue to become worse with time. If you actually want to hear black metal, listen to Darkthrone."
1,Dani's last name sums it up. FILTH.,"I wouldn't give this, or any of their previous CD's ANY stars if I had the choice. The sound quality sucks on each of them, and listening to Dani Filth is the equivalent of listening to dogs bark, baby's cry, mixed with a bunch of annoying whistling. These guys epitomize CRAP music -- there's nothing ""beautiful"" or even ""hard"" about them, it's simply noise, and the lead singer really knows how to give you a headache with his feminine squeels. ""Ah, I can't scream, can't yell, I have no singing voice. I guess I'll just squeel like a stuck pig on every track!"" -- I have nothing against this approach, except for the first time I can remember, I've never been bothered by a lead singer's voice as much as I have Filth's. I can see why people are so drawn on giving them a chance. I personally think Dimmu Borgir is a WAY better choice, so give some of their previous CD's a try. They completely outshine Cradle of Filth."
1,Very Bad Indeed,Noone understands me! I'm a goth! Oh please help! This is awful; I gave it to a friend and she used it as a coaster to put hot cups of coffee on - the thing is one of her coffee cups got all embarrassed and chucked it out with the trash.
1,This album serves as much purpose as a mint-flavored suppository,Enough said!and to think it has taken Adrian well over FOUR albums to get his act together and really pound those skins.Stay away from these clowns wearing patchy make-up.
5,Superb,This album is sure to bring new fans if you haven't heard Cradle of Filth before. This cd is fast paced and pushes your eardrums to the brink of tearing(yes its that loud). This album is without a odubt beautiful from the bring to the end of existance in *cthulhu dawn* to the telling of a lost love in *her ghost in the fog* and finally to the telling of demons overtaking heaven in*tortured soul asslyumn* this album will surely shock you into liking cof.
5,Sweet,"My first black metal band, Cradle of Filth, never ceases to amaze me. Though the lineup constantly changes, It doesnt really matter. I love Dani's voice, and the drummer is great. The two guitarist are great, rivaling Kerry King's super fast picking. Dani's screams are unrelenting, throwing you off with a whisper or two. The keyboards are so cheese, as is with all black metal bands. Good stuff."
3,"Good album, but still very [...] ...","I kind of dig the music and the style in general. But c'mon, they are so freaking overrated. Vampires,demons ??? Oh..puhlease.I know, i know, you can't compare them to Dimmu, but Borgirs are so much tighter,interesting and darker. Still..It's a good goth-new-era-black metal hybrid. But if you like more Epic and extreme music like Dimmu,Borknagar or even Enslaved, you'll be slightly upset with this release. Ow yeah...And keyboards do sound cheesy, unlike Dimmu's."
4,"NOT REALLY BLACK METAL, NOT REALLY GOTH","Well this band is not really black metal, but it is not really goth metal either. I think the best label for this band is Goth-black metal. If you are a traditional black metal fan you definitely wont like this because this band is anything but ""raw"". However, if you are just getting into black metal this band is probably a good start, and Six Feet Under is a good start for death metal. These bands will lead you to bigger and better things. Best songs on this CD are ""Chtulu Dawn"" and ""her ghost in the fog"". Fairly decent stuff, if you are a Cradle of Filth fan you will probably like this so pick it up."
5,Worth the Wait,"I just got the cd on the day it was released full of anticipation. I have loved COF for a few years now, and I enjoy every one of their efforts even though each one is different from the next. Cradle once again shows on ""Midian"" that they are not afraid to take their unique blend of dark metal in new directions. Im sure a few fans will not appreciate some of the efforts on this record but I for one think that it is a superb record. The only flaw is the track Satanic Mantra , im really not sure why this was put on this otherwise perfect record, luckily its only about a minute long. Stand outs on the cd are- ""Saffron's Curse, Tearing the veil from grace, and Her ghost in the fog."
3,could have been 1/2 as long.,"A few of the songs start out really good, but tend to drag on.Lord abortion and Her ghost in the fog are about the only two songs that are good start to finish.""Satanic Mantra"" is the biggest waste of CD space."
5,great cd!!! BUY IT!!!!!!,"I was one of those anti-COF people at one time...But I decided to give this band another try.I like all kinds of Black Metal from Raw(no production) to The more Popular bands.Cradle of Filth are talented musicians,and Dani is a very Talented singer.They are nothing to take too seriously,listening to COF is like watching an old horror movie,its just great entertainment,I don't think they are going for anything political or with an exstreme message.They just play good music!Buy this release,who cares what people say about them,they are good,I been into this scene for years,and if you want good music this is it!"
3,shlock-metal,"I'm not a big Black/Vampire metal fan, but I was intrigued by the hype so I picked up this CD. Musically it reminds me of the ""classical"" speed metal of the 80s: Helloween, Assassin, plus maybe Malmsteen, Coroner -- though I'd say this is definitely Black metal; viz the screech vocals (like Mayhem and maybe Sadus). There are some nice touches, and at least it's not a monotonous album, but most of the atmosphere comes from tired ideas like female vocals and church-organ keyboards. There's nothing really special about the musicianship, either. It would be interesting if they tried to push the envelope a little, transcend their little niche. Maybe next time."
3,I like the newer stuff better,"This CD was kind of spoiled to me because I had bought it after I had bought Lovecraft and Witch Hearts, which had the better half of the songs on this CD already on it. But strictly speaking on the tracks on this CD, I think that it rightly deserves a three star rating. It wasn't as dark as I would have liked for it to have been, nor were the vocals totally tamed. Now, with more experience, Cradle of Filth has created a variety of better-sounding, better-themed albums that are much more valuable to me."
4,not the best,"I love CoF, but this one dissapointed me. It seemed a little too goth, and not metal enough. Don't get me wrong, it is still a good album, just doesn't sound like old Cradle. Also, the track listing on this page IS right, and the other reviewer is wrong in the bonus track's name. If you are a huge Cradle fan, I'd get this cd, but if you are just a mediocre fan, go for the original release of Midian and save yourself some cash."
3,one word...destruction!,"I do really admire cradles work...but one thing about this album is that the energy level that is directed at being total pure destruction, hate and aggresion.I used to play this cd quite a bit but now tend to give it a rest...focusing nowadays on more soothing relaxing stuff...like dead can dance."
4,"Get some new ideas, guys","Ok, Dont get me wrong, I respect cradle of filth's EARLY stuff with both robin graves and nicolas. However this album Midian is very unispired and WAY to repetative, even for black metal. this album is just WANNABE black metal. Besides, COF did wrong by covering not just iron Maidens Hallowed be thy name, but also venoms black metal. Come on guys, go back to the days of principles of evil made flesh. maybe the pit mongers won't try to rush the stage with evil intent at your shows as often."
5,Yet another triumph for CoF,"This CD starts off with their trademark atmospheric instrumental track, but this time mixing in more Baroque musical influences which really increased the mood of the CD. Then as Cthuhlu Dawn rolls around Gian & Company geer up and blast out yet another musical atrocity that send the righteous fearfully running to the hills! =) Then I braced for Dani's trademark banshee wail to signify that it is too late to turn back -- this one, hands down, topped them all. My blood ran cold as ice! I still get shivers thinking about what dastardly demonic fabrication of my nightmares would make such a wail! This CD does NOT give you a second to catch your breath! Any fans of Black Metal will surely enjoy this album, even if they are not fans of Dani's previous work. They have really turned it up a notch, with better production and a heavier influence on guitars and keyboards. If you haven't heard CoF yet, try this -- you won't be dissappointed. If you are a CoF fan, get it now!!"
5,"Excellent, but could you expect less.","Cradle of Filth, it seems they will never cease to amaze. This album shows how much they want to stay the great band they are and always have been. People call this band one of the biggest sell out bands in the world. How can this be, they have stayed consistant through the years with their unreal ability to play black metal the way they know how. This album shows that with a great production, you can produce some of the finest metal I have ever heard. Just as good as all their earlier work, maybe even better..."
2,Terrible,"The only reason I gave this album two stars is because it has some really good keyboard parts. Otherwise this is the most god awful Cradle of Filth release ever. There is absolutely no flow to the album at all, every songs' instrumentals sound extremely choppy. The vocals sound extremely out of place on the album and lack the emotion that was put into them on previous releases. And the drums are absolutely terrible, Nick Barker's departure was obviously a severe blow to the band. But I suppose this is what happens when Dani Filth turned into a rock star. His firing of songwriter Stuart is something this band is not going to recover from. As he put it, the band is becoming ""Dani and the Filths."" And if your one of those people who thinks this is a good album, listen to Vempire, then Midian, and think twice about this being a good album. If you don't have it already, don't bother."
4,CoF's Best,"Her Ghost in the Fog is brilliant. Death Magick for Adepts has a punk vibe, with Dani Filth singing? Can you imagine it? Well...its REALLY, REALLY bad! The Keyboardist guy is at this best on this album also. Lord Abortion and Saffrons Curse are 2 good examples. This maybe Cradle's least gothic album. So much better than Damnation and a Day. And I think Cradle of Filth are getting worse and worse by the day."
5,best cof album in my opinion,"in my opinion, this is the best cradle album there is. why has no one mentioned saffrons curse? thats one of the best tracks! the whole album is great. and i just wanted to make a point of asking- why do people write reviews to insult cds? its not going to change anyones mind u know! just because it isnt the kind of music you're used to doesn't make it bad. each to their own! anyway....not the heaviest metal out there, but who cares? this is great! all credit to dani filths amazing vocals- definitely one of the most distinctive voices out there. the music has a powerful, sometimes even majestic, feel to it which brings the whole thing together.and anyone who is about to write an insulting review about this cd- dont! im sure you wouldnt like someone telling u how 'cr*p' you're music is. im done."
4,Hmmm...,"I had heard many good things about Cradle of Filth and this album in particular prior to purchasing it, and I just happened to find a copy in my local music store, not knowing anything about what to expect. Now that I've expanded my Filth collection, it's the worst of their albums, as the synth is way overdone, but it's still pretty good. The first two full-length songs are the best. Most of the other stuff is good, but suffers from the omnipresent vocal downfall and the overdone keyboards/synth, which overpowers the guitars at times and doesn't sound much like metal. Anyway, pretty good album, and not a bad place to start a Cradle collection."
2,Why so low rating and what I love about Raggedy Ann !,I started to watch Cartoon Craze today for the first time since 2 year that I get the dvd but never watched til today ! I only love two espodies of the carttoon Crazy that are 1 Suddenly it's Spring 2 Enchanted Square from Raggedy Ann ! 2 Raggedy Ann carttoons have great music and color plus a little message at the end of Enachanted Square ! The six carttoons I was not happy about like the Raggedy ann carttoons !Raggedy Ann carttoons dates back to 1944 through 1947 entertaining to watchfor childhood memories !
4,The Master Profit PLan,"I wish that this had been the first or second book I read about daytrading for a living. It would have saved me alot of money.Daytrading, at least for me, is tape reading, plain and simple. The book stresses that. Erase the outside noise and watch the tape. If your right, great, if not get out fast (no hard feelings, it's not personal).Also, as discussed throughout the book, I finally forced myself to set up a written trading plan. I read it every morning prior to trading. It has helped re-inforce my discipline.Very good book for daytraders. Especially liked the stories from actual traders. Seems many of us go through the same problems."
1,Strange publisher's error,"The book arrived with the right cover, but inside the paperback binding was another book. I returned it and all monies were returned to my charge card in a day or two. What is the chance of that happening again?"
4,A little jewel indeed!,"This movie is so cleverly written, that simply can stop take your eyues off the screen at any minute. The sequences are all tied together, one climax suceeds the other... It's a shame it did not get the recognition it deserved."
1,Very disappointed,Item came tarnished. I realize you get what you pay for but... I did receive a 15% credit on the item. Jaf Gifts was willing to accommodate me.
3,Emanuell,It was so cool i loved it i had seen it with all of my friend they even loved it was a wonderful movie
2,took a really long (3h+) to install correctly,"seems to be fine now, however instructions are lacking. Took way too much time to figure out the proper way to latch things into the receptacle."
1,Sturdy but has fitment issues,Holds the head unit in just fine. Good quality plastic. Problem lies in the bottom on the housing. There's a gap in between the bottom of the housing and the dash which allows you to see the metal in your car's dash. Very unappealing in my opinion. If you don't mind a small gap then by all means go for this product. Others have also experienced this issue if you read reviews from other sites.
4,I prayed it would be a nice charm,I was impressed with the woven texture background. It accents the praying hands nicely. The charm is about the size of a nickel. The sterling silver did not let me down. I plan to get the real one next! I wear it on a chain with a sterling silver cross. They look great together.
1,I hate this album,"To think that they have two failed LP's whcih have since been dubbed 'Birth of a legend' and 'Yellow Matter Custard' in their pockets and the only rare stuff we get is THe Beatles with Tony Sheridan. This album is worth steeringh clear of. The Beatles only appear properly on two songs, the first two songs. On the other twelve songs Tony Sheridan is the lead vocalist and only half fo those song feature the Beatles on backing. The 'Beat Brothers' are not the Beatles. Oh, by the way, Birth of a legend is an early 1962 LP that they cut for Decca, who didn't sign them, and the BBC didn't sign them on the strength of 'Yellow Matter Custard', which it wasn't originally called. Third time lucky, I suppose. But even if they aren't as good as Please Please Me or Sergeant Pepper, they are two LP's made up entirely of Beatles songs, and the public and the fans deserve to have these two albums released!"
4,One of the Best Books on Home Theater,"Saw this at my local bookstore and checked with Amazon.com and was happy to purchase it online for a substantial discount here. This book is great for anyone beginning to setup their own home theater and for those that really like to get into the meat of this hobby. The pages are easy to read with good, clear black and white photos spread throughout.What this book offers are those uncommon tips and tricks that big name electronics stores don't want you to know about. This book alone will save me hundreds of dollars from all the information provided inside. It's doesn't have too much techno-babble but it won't feel like a crash course booklet leaving you wanting more. Intelligently laid out and highly recommended."
3,Home theater hacks,"I purchased this book to gain more knowledge of home theater and audio equipment. My expectation was that the book will cover those topics in great depth. However I found that this book covers a lot of basic stuffs ( a little too much for me). I would recommend this book if you have no clue about TV, audio or home theater. That's the reason I gave only three stars. It is sole based on my expectation.The book is greatly written and easy to understand."
5,Wonderful Jazz,"A wonderfully vibrant, rhythmic, melodic and spontaneous live jazz recording. Thanks Louis and well done to your band. You ensure the survival of the jazz guitar as a craft, art form and voice."
3,Decent Indy-Fed action,"Despite the seemingly inconsequential title, there is actually some pretty cool stuff on here. There's early footage of now former WWF champ Mick Foley as Cactus Jack, as well as current WWF star Gangrel (Dave Heath) as one half of the Blackhearts tag team. Wrestling fans looking for something different may want to check this out."
3,A Ton of Variety,Well this isn't the greatest video but you will see a huge variety. You see great footage of curent stars like Cactus Jack and Luna Vachon. You do see some stupid things like a tag Team called Wet-n-wild. It is worth the money.
3,Interview with Tommy Evans just before his death,Australian music author / collector / historian Glen A Baker interviews original Iveys / Badfinger writer / singer / guitarist Tommy Evans just before he hung himself in November 1983. A very interesting historical insight.
5,"I have never actually seen this video, but I was there LIVE",Well this should actually be pretty good ! I was there Live and enjoyed every minute of it !!!!Buy the video and try to pick which person is me Thanks !
4,Endearing story,"Two words came to mind while I was reading this book: Endearing and Melancholy. This memoir was written from the memories of a little girl now grown. Her young life seems nothing but gloomy, and yet she never forsakes her sliver of hope.Little Marianna learned all she could from her peers and other patients at the hospital where she was bound. She was very perceptive and eager. She learned about many other beliefs regarding life and the afterlife, and she (as the author) sums up what she believes to be the truth.The only drag in reading the book is that the author's thoughts sometimes jump around as she remembers more things that are important to her. Many of the details may not seem important to the reader, but are interesting nevertheless.Reading this book was heartening. The author takes the reader on a journey through her heart and mind. She has a calm, satisfied characteristic to her words. And she knows how to use great descriptive words."
1,Will not fit 2004.,Didn't return it as someone I know needed this particular one. However it won't fit a 2004.. the plugs are different.
2,"Not an encyclopedia, more a book of biographical snippets","I prefer the Stock Car Racing Encyclopedia to this book. This one simple goes through, alphabetically, most things associated with stock car racing. Very short bios and stories are included, but precious few statistics. None, really. So go with the other title and leave this one on the shelf."
4,A good book for your car lover,We purchased this for a family member. I find it a bit overpriced on some sites but overall it was a good gift.
4,Very informative,"I was doing research on ""Champion Raceway"" in Fayetteville, N.C. in the early ""50s"", and using this book I found that the (Then) Grand National Series raced some races there. It was quite exciting to uncover some of our racing heritage using this book"
2,Annoying,"I can't believe I'm writing a less than stellar review of any Nora Roberts book, but this one just didn't work for me. I adore NR & all of her books - trilogies, magic, mysteries, etc. and was excited to read ""Birthright"", however, less than halfway through I was totally annoyed with the book. The main characters were so unlikeable, particulary the woman (why is rude & nasty loveable in some of NR's books?) & the storyline just bounced around too much. I found myself, for the first time w/a NR book, skimming through some of the pages.Now that being said, I am enjoying NR's newest trilogy (I've just started the 2nd book) and never find these magical storylines boring - different strokes for different folks I guess."
4,Double romance with the suspence,I really enjoyed this book. The sparks between calli Dunebrook and Jacob Graystone are great!! Alsot he secondary romance between Lynn and Doug. The end was at a great pace. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the consatnt use of G**D***. I don't think I a being a prude but it was not necessary there are other words that would suffice. Otherwise it was a great book.
2,Not Nora Roberts' Best,I was disappointed in this book--which never ever happens with a Nora Roberts story. I figured out 95 percent of the mystery almost immediately--and the romances were a big let down. This is the one books of Ms. Roberts that I wish I had waited for the paperback verion--and saved myself some money.
5,"Excellent Writer, Excellent Story,","Most people already know that anything Ms. Roberts writes is an excellent write! Excellent writer, excellent story!"
3,Mixed feelings,"A very intersting premise and not a bad story overall, but I did not like any of the characters and the dialogue was at times, just plain horrible. I admit, I didn't read the book but listened to the audiobook on CD that I got from the library, I knew nothing about the author, but the storyline seemed interesting. It really took me a long time to get through this, I wasn't impressed enough that I think I would ever read another book from the author. Not a bad book, just not my cup of tea."
2,STILL TRYING TO GET THRU IT,Nora Robert's is my favorite author and her books are the best...but I am having a tough time getting thru this one. Birthright doesn't project any of the detailed gorgeous scenery Nora is so wonderful at describing. The characters are just ok. I am still reading it..and have been putting down for a month now on and off!
3,Disappointing,"Usually I am an Nora Robert's fan, but this book was disappointing to me. I find that the main character Callie is very annoying. There is so much thing going on in the book that sometimes it's confusing. The romance was not what I expected from her other books. I hope her next book will be better than this one."
1,Irritating main character,"I found it difficult to like and stay interested in a main character who was rude, immature, self centered, frequently lost her temper like a child and who used foul language indiscriminately. I was also dumbfounded that a person intelligent enough to obtain her doctorate would be stupid enough to go to an isolated constuction site alone and confront a bunch of construction workers, yell at them using foul language and actually physically push one of them. And that was not the only time Callie put herself in mortal danger with very illogical behavior. I was sorry I wasted my time on this one."
4,Right On!,"As the previous reviewers have already stated, this story encompasses many plots; all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another. Callie Dunbrook, archeologist, out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team - her ex-husband/anthropologist, Jake Graystone. Not only do Callie and Jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of Woodsboro, MD, Callie has a bigger surprise in store for her - the discovery of a birth mother, father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction. This story plays many different angles, but Nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters - Doug, Lana, little Ty, Suzanne, Jay, Vivian and Elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team, and I especially like Digger! Definitely a Nora book you won't want to miss - Birthright is a great find."
4,Roberts' writing is fantastic!,"Yes, I'm a huge Nora Roberts fan, but I'm willing to say when I don't like a book. Not the case with Birthright. I loved it! It made me cry tears of joy and tears of sadness for the characters. It might have something to do with my own adoption, but I really felt connected with Callie. Great job Nora!"
4,strong romantic suspense,"Archaeologist Callie Dunbrook is called to Antietam Creek to investigate the bones accidentally dug up at a controversial construction project. There she is unhappy to learn that she must work with anthropologist Jake Greystone, a former colleague and her ex husband. Together they must confront their own passions, a town divided about the construction and the very disturbing claims of a local business woman about Callie's own history that deeply affect her.As usual Nora Roberts weaves a great story that is fun to read. The main characters are well developed and easy to like. There is a perfect combination of romance and suspense and the plot twists keep the reader's attention until the final page."
4,I don't get all the negative reviews,"I will be honest that I was rather reluctant to start this book after reading so many negative reviews. However, I have been pleasntly surprised. Unlike many readers I found the character of Callie to be interesting. Just because a woman is educated, doesn't make them perfect people. I for one liked reading about an intelligent woman with flaws. Everyone saw Callie as selfish, but I didn't see that at all. I saw her as someone struggling to deal with a situation that she had no control over. I did not like the character of Doug at all. I thought the romance between him and Lana was just put in to fill pages. Lana would have been better off with someone who had a little more personality. It was very nice to read a Nora Roberts book that didn't have the paranormal mumbo jumbo that she sticks in so many of her books."
3,"Wonderful Book, Horrible Audio","It is a shame that a book as wonderful as Birthright has such a horrible narrator like Bernadette Quigley. I had the unfortunate chance to hear Ms. Quigley on the Three Fates audio and it was done so poorly, I actually returned it to the store. I didn't check to see who was reading Birthright, much to my chagrin. Ms. Quigley does not seem to have a range of voices to pull from, such as a fellow reader of Nora Roberts, Sandra Burr. In this reading Jake sounds like an eighty year old man and it's actually kinda creepy. Most of the male characters all have the same `voice' and you aren't sure who is supposed to be talking until their name is spoken. Ms. Quigley does an excellent job of reading Callie. She uses just the right amount of sarcasm in her voice and Lana is pretty well done too, but beyond that, it's terrible. I HIGHLY recommend the book, but stay far away from the audio!"
2,Ending spoils novel,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book until the end which was so unbelievable and poorly explained, it spoiled the book for me. I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts but very disappointed in this novel."
1,How disappointing,"I seldom can afford to buy hardcover books but I am such a fan of Nora Roberts that I can't stand to wait for the paper back edition. Hence I was on the waiting list for her latest. The editors writeup did not sound like something I'd enjoy but we often have different tastes.This time we were years apart. This was the dullest book I have ever read; and yes, I plowed all the way to the end because often times Ms Roberts saves the last part of the book for a smashing finish.Believe me, I could have lost this book at any point and never wondered again who did what. PLEASE wait for the paper back to bore yourself to death!!!"
3,Interesting,"This was the first time I read a book by Nora Roberts. And, I really enjoyed it.I did not care for the main character. She was too virile, and she seems like she is mad at the entire world. And for what? Maybe if the author had really delved into her personality a bit more, I could understand where the anger was coming from.I have rarely found any authors that write good dialogue. So, her dialogue could have been fine-tuned.So, I'll give this story 3-stars."
5,Excellent as usual,"Wonderful story, believable characters, great romance with an excellent twist at the end. This is a must have for NoraRobert fans!!"
2,Let down,"Where is the fire, the magic of our beloved Nora? It's not in Birthright. I plodded through it, page by page. Too many details. I could excavate an archialogical dig myself from this book - I guess some would say that's great - I'd agree. Once.The characters were pretty good, her typical fiery woman and man. But we keep asking ourselves, should we care?I finished the book and was glad when I did. Then I re-read some awesome older Nora works because she is the best - no matter what. And you have to read the best. Since she has plenty of other womderful works out there, don't bother with this one.Find one of her jewels and read it!"
5,Leo is the Computer Man!,"This is the followup to Poor Leo's 2002 Almanac and is sure to be a hit for those of you are just getting to know your personal confuser as Mr. Laporte calls it. It's not a really geeky book, but has many good tips in it. The organization is similar to last year's book, a tip for every day of the year. The first two weeks cover how to make your computer secure, well worth the price of the book."
1,Save your money,"Hype, hype, hype.. that's all this book is about. Fortunately, I bought my copy at a brick and mortar store who have a 1 dayreturn policy. Did not need 1 day, 10 minutes was enough to decide that I could find everything in it on any decent tech web site.Save your money, surf the net, you will find everything thats in the book for free, which is a better deal in my book."
1,No good info,I read this book for awhile then looked on the net to see if i can find the same info an in a 1min i found it all..This book [stinks] Big time! dont waste your money...THats what the net is for :)
1,"yawn, yawn, yawn","my god, how can ppl make money on stuff that's freely available (to those with internet access)...meh, Leo is only making nickels and dimes from each book, he probably got a large advance.how many versions of this ""book"" are there? DVD, calendar? is there going to be one with useful information?"
5,Leo Rocks,"Leo's book rocks! Even if I already know half of the stuff already, I still like rereading stuff I already know. Everyone should buy 2, 3, even 4 copies. Help make Leo number 1!(Even though he already is)"
2,Save your time and money,"Not a very good book for those who are pregnant for the first time or any successive time, unless you laugh when someone continually says barf.Not really too much at all on aspects of bein pregnant, mostly on her life which is rather uninteresting and tries to create some sort of humor.Nicely edited, but look elsewhere for GOOD reading."
5,Makes me want to get pregnant! Almost...,"When Martha was writing her weekly column of ""Diary of a Pregnancy"" on MSN Women, I would wait breathlessly for the next week's edition to see what crazy things had happened to Martha and her husband this time. I don't know how she finds something funny in every mile-marker of pregnancy, but she does! I was thrilled when her columns were published into a book - great cover illustration, too. I now give this book to all my friends as soon as they announce they are pregnant - seems to be a lot of them lately! They always report back to me as to how engaging and funny this book is. I want more books from Martha!!!"
2,made motherhood sound depressing,"I bought this while pregnant hoping for a light read, and somene to say ""it's really not so bad."". I didn't get that from this book. Instead, I felt the author was constantly whining about every little annoyance with her pregnancy and new parenthood. (Trying to do this humorously is still whining.) From complaining she had no time to herself, to lamenting that it was taking her forever to lose her pregnancy weight. At the end of every chapter, she would write some sort of sappy cliche about her baby, as if that made up for all the previous grousing.This book did nothing to encourage me or make me look forward to being a mom. It did make me dread the birth of my baby, but now that I am 6 months into motherhood, I have found it really ISN'T that bad. :)"
2,Don't understand the five star reviews,"She writes well but I find most of the commentary, ironically...rather infantile."
1,Absolutely without humor or insight and not well written,"This book is NOT funny. It just isn't. Using the word ""barf"" a million times in a nonpun- not amusing. In fact the only time I laughed during the book was from a Rita Rudner quote. Rita Rudner- funny. The writing style is overly chatty dear diary. Annoying. I'm not interested in her dull life, only her pregnancy. I could get more insight talking to a random pregnant woman. It isn't even sweetly funny. I would love a good pregnancy book, I'm sick of the medical guides. But this isn't it. I welcome recommendations. PAss on this one. I fell asleep to it."
5,"As always, funny, wity, DELIGHTFUL!","I have throughly enjoyed reading Martha's columns for years on Encarta. She is wity and simply a delight to read. When I read she was writing a book I knew it would be great...I wasn't disappointed. Even though I don't have kids, I have many friends that do. If you want a book that will make you laugh at the everyday events in life and remind you that life is simply wonderful. This is the book for you. Single or married. I highly recommend it."
2,Who am I reviewing again?,"After listening to this disc I thought that Hoobas..., er Three Days Gr..., er who am I reviewing again? While there are a couple catchy songs (Face Down, Damn Regret) I just couldn't find a single thing that The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus offers, at least on their first disc, that's different than the dozens other bands with an emo/faux metal sound with the occasional misplaced grunting/screaming. The definitely have potential but I bought this at the same time as Coheed and Cambria's new disc and Don't Fake It is now collecting dust while No World For Tomorrow is stuck in my head.And to top it off, they had a guest appearance on The Hills. Need I say more?"
5,i love the red jumpsuit apparatus !,i fell in love with 'face down'. i love the cd. i adore the singers voice and the music is something you can pick up and sing along with in shower if you want to.
2,I stopped listening at track 8,"I do event DJing and picked this CD up for a reason I'm not sure of yet. I have the radio released song(s) on promo discs so the purchase was not neccesary. I saw it on sale for $8 so I guess that's why I bought it. I try to buy some top 40 stuff for the kids for parties and stuff like that. I'm 32 and have no limitations to what I listen to and like. When I put this in to listen to it, Of course, I could not tell one song from the other. I stopped listening during track 8 because 30 minutes of the same song is enough in 1 day. If you want to get some current music that is similiar to this, I'd say get OK Go, Panic! At the Disco, or 30 Seconds To Mars. I probably could have spent my $8 better by ramdomly selecting one of the other $8 sale CDs."
2,Would be good except for the screaming,"I heard some of their songs on the radio and thought this album would be good. It would be, if half the songs didn't have this low, gutteral screaming in them. I just couldn't listen. I don't think I've listened to the entire album all the way through."
3,After a week it's boring,"I love Face Down, when I bought the record at Best Buy the song version was more ""screamo"" than it is on the radio...I don't understand why they would limit the screaming, it is only on one line of the song, but whatever. Wouldn't want kids to be exposed to screaming, I guess! I like the first five songs, after that I kind of skip around.Some of my favorite bands are Emery, FFAF, This Providence, Cute Is What We Aim For, etc...so I guess RJA fits in those sort of genres somewhere...but it's definitely not my favorite."
1,how much worse can it get,"i'm tired of all these bands that come out and they think they sound good. this is another example of how dumb music is sometimes. RJA has copied every other band i've heard of and i'm sick of that. ""Face Down"" is there first single and it sounds like a rip of MXPX. so yeah not even that song. ""Guardian Angel"" or whatever sounds like Copeland, or Lifehouse or something like that. i mean every song on the cd is a copy of other bands. no originality what so ever. i wish bands that are trying to make it big use their own skills in writing instead of others. one star is the least i could do, and that's sad cause i enjoy music, don't waste your time on this cd."
2,yuck,"Well all I can say is I bought this cd hoping to be something great and all I got was a washed out sound of mess. There are only like 2 great songs that caught my attention, other than that, I think that I would have rather cleaned my bathroom."
3,The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus - don't you fake it,"If you could imagine a marriage between Taking Back Sunday's ""where you want to be"" and the entire Hawthorne Heights catalogue, you'd have ""dont you fake it"" down cold.TRJA aren't very original, or exciting, but their catchy sound is sure to win over more than just a few warped tour goers.Fans of commericalized screamo ala My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, Hawthorne Heights and The Used will find alot to enjoy on this energetic debut."
4,punk-emo-screamo-post hardcore,"this is a good cd if you like hawthorne heights or silversteinin fate's hands is one of the best songs on the cdoverall, its a good cd some songs sound more poppy and some are emoits a good cd2 thumbs up"
5,The Jumpsuit is the deal,"Ok, I'm going to spare the gushing or the song by song breakdown/explanation of why this band is just so good. I was first introduced to them when they opened for 30 Seconds to Mars. Never before has an opening act grabbed my attention the way they did. They just have a presence about them. Anyone who has seen them will say the same. They are just as good live as the cd, and the cd is really good. Don't dismiss them as emo, screamo or try to compare them to others. What they are is a group of very talented musicians, and Don't You Fake It is one of those cd's that you just have to listen to over and over and over and over..."
1,Radio air time is deceiving.,"After hearing Face Down and Your Guardian Angel, which is an absolutely beautiful song, I decided that I wouldn't mind having this CD. BIG MISTAKE. There is a huge difference between the songs you hear on the radio and the ones on this CD. The only genre I could put them in is screamo. The majority of songs on this album are not sung, they are simply screamed out in what sounds like some type of hellish gag. Do not buy this album if you like what's on the radio, you won't hear it, except for 2 songs."
4,Awesome New Music,"Don't You Fake It is an amazing debut filled with catchy songs. Red Jumpsuit Apparatus can stand up with the likes of Taking Back Sunday and Hawthorne Heights with their screamo, emo sound. The lyrics have deep meaning and will have you singing along. Every song on the cd is different and worth taking a listen to. If you liked their debut single "" Face Down"" this cd won't disappoint you."
2,somewhat original,"I was hoping for more, this band is very much a product of the current music environment."
4,Pretty good,"This album consists of several great songs and some okay screamo-esque ones. The best songs on the album are the hit(s) face down and Your Guardian Angel, Damn Regret, 17 aint so sweet, & Cat and Mouse. This album is for fans of The All-American Rejects, Plain White t's, Cartel and several other Punk Rock bands. Though some songs are similiar they don't seem to get old and this cd is at least worth a listen or possibly a few downloads from itunes or a similiar service."
3,This is the best there is?,"With a title like this, you would suspect it was a fairly solid collecion. Unfortunately, to my surprise a decent multi-disc collection of classic 80s videos really doesn't exist (as hard as that is to believe). This set makes a minor attempt with two discs worth of classic MTV era videos (when they played videos) and one disc of largely semi-obscure heavy metal videos (with a couple of exceptions) that really don't belong here. I totally get that licensing may be an issue with some tracks, but if this is the best we can get right now, I will wait and hope that something better comes along."
3,Can get individually,"I recently saw these three discs on sale individually at WalMart for less than $10 each. I don't see much advantage to the box set, especially as weak as the ""headbangers"" disc is."
2,Great when it would work.,"When I first turned it on it would power up, but wouldn't do anything. Coby customer service tried to tell me it was because I used the component out instead of the av cables from the box. While on the phone the picture finally came on. Dvds looked great on it until it froze. Froze while playing from the hard drive. I sent it back."
2,"Worked well, until it didn't work","I purchased this in December 2006. I wasn't thrilled with how all of the features worked, but it did do everything as advertised. Once I became accustomed to the limitations of this machine, I was actually happy with it. However, about 90 days after purchasing the recorder, which comes with a 90 day warranty, the DVD drive completely died. The rest of the machine still works, but what am it's not worth much any more. I guess I should have bought a better brand name with a longer warranty."
1,Poor quality,Only one earbud works. As for the product which consist of two earbuds and one mic it is or poor quality or poor QA.Apart for it it works fine.
5,Eazy Power Head Plugs,"My husband and I looked in numerous hardware stores in our area and were unable to find them. These were the perfect size for the project he was building. Had we known that local hardware stores don't carry this size, we would have ordered on line right away. Thank you for having them."
2,"Only worked for 1 month, check engine light on again","it was a pretty decent price and i took the risk, and it worked fantastic for a little bit more than a month, check engine light turned on again code p0505 (IAC malfunction) after a cold day... i might need to buy another one from someone else."
4,More than I expected,I became a fan of Kieth when he first started out and never looked back. This album has me trying to get every one to listen to it. Just like my other favorite artist Prince he is simply moving with technology by adding rappers. I praise him for changing his style once or twice. Whether or not he uses rappers or hard rock artists he has already established himself as a beggar. So go with the flow I never got into rap until now because music is music and he realizes that. Go Kieth you are blessed.
2,very run of the mill,Keith Sweat is hit&miss with me.his First Album was a Classic.the 2nd one had moments then the next two weren't happening except for a few tracks then the album in 96 got him back on track but then he fell off again with his last.but this one is even weaker.it seems to Maufactured to me.his trademark sound is nowhere to be found.he is Buried behind Beats&Rappers.it's cool with Him&Dave Hollister&T Boyz.but Keith Sweat in his hey day never had to share the Mike with anyone.
5,SOMETHING DIFFERENT....Giving R Kelly competition,This Cd was almost judged by its cover....the ole beggar Keith we have known for ages now. But this Cd features smooth laid back track with several featuring artist that keep you busy. By keeping the mood right and just chilling. Play it from begining to end. But you'll never...Never hit skip or FFWD. Promise! R Kelly talented yes...consistent NO. I have to admit R Kelly had some nice tracks ...undressing himself on one track ...fiesta Ricky Martin type stuff on another... nice commercial song I Wish and you've sold a million albums.
3,Not His Best,"I was disappointed by this album because for some reasons Keith felt that he had to put rappers on the album. Why would he have Busta Rhymes and Rah Digga on here? Or Lil Wayne? At this point in his established career, he should try to keep the fans that he already has and not worry about garnering new ones. The album is too fast pace. The only songs that I like is the lead single and ""He Say She Say"" which he does with T-Boz. My advice is to but the single if you like it, but the album is not worth it."
1,WARNING! WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS CD!,"After listening to this CD a couple of times, I was extremely disappointed. I almost threw it in the trash! I expected slow sensuous R&B songs that Keith is so well known for. This CD consists mostly of Hip-Hop and rap songs. If you want a good Keith Sweat CD, get the self-entitled ""Keith Sweat"" album. You've been warned!"
2,Not meant for my dog.,"Your better off with some Penn tennis balls. These smell like mint but I haven't noticed any minty smell on my pup. That may be because I'm not smelling my dogs breath on a regular basis.They aren't chew toys, and they are not marketed as them. I tried playing fetch with him and he refused to give it back, I ran all over the place and crawled under the table trying to get it back. Eventually he lost it somehow and my mom found it in her closet.The problem with these is that my pup enjoyed eating the fuzz off of them and peeling the fuzz off the ball (which came off with a layer of the ball) I woke up one morning to a half tennis ball, half lacrosse ball.If your dog is well behaved and not a heavy chewer go for it!"
3,not so Tuff,Although they are supposed to be industrial strength my dog still managed to destroy them in no time. Dont buy them for the tough quality.
3,Better than the rest of the radio,"The props here go to Beck. Eh? ""Then the morning comes"" is just generic Odelay with a little more sugary pop production. Just listen next time it's on the radio. The fact that it vaguely recalls Beck is a testament to why it's better than anything else on the radio."
3,OK cd,Not much to brag about here. The only good songs are the hits from the radio. I'd hold off on this cd and look for the songs you what on a compilation album!
4,Cool stuff,I think this album is definitely better than their last album. I really like the whole spacey theme to the album. I also like all the synthesized stuff in it too.
4,Awesome CD,"I got this cd when I first heard some of Smash Mouth's songs at my friend's house. This cd includes All Star, Come on Come on,Who's There, and some other ones. I mainly got this cd because I wanted to hear the songs listed above a billion times, but all the songs on the cd are either ok or good or excellent."
2,A big :^(,"I recieved this CD for my birthday a week or two ago and was thrilled. But little did I know, that this album SUX! Every single song on here sounds the same! I think they could do alot better. I really like the song All STAR though, so have have to give it 2 stars (but that is still exaggerating a bit)"
5,This is 1999's BEST cd yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Astro lounge is Smash Mouth's best cd ever! U gotta hear these songs and lyrics! They're da bomb! These ain't this summer's regular, N*sync or BSB songs. SM accually knows how to play the instraments! I mean, even Vh1 and Mtv love Smash Mouth, All Star has been on the charts for weeks!!!!!!! And with Amazon, u don't even have to leave your room to buy it! Smash Mouth's # 1!"
2,4 Good Songs..9 Bad,"Man..there first cd wuz great. I expected more from Astro Lounge. What's up with this pop garbage? What happened to the punk Smash Mouth I love best?!?! Well there are 4 good songs(All Star,Come on Come on,Diggin Your Scence, Can't Get Enough Of You Baby) The rest are pretty bad."
3,This CD is definatly a change from the old SMASH MOUTH,"that I loved, but hey, with All Star and Can't Get enough of you baby it kinda maybe a little makes up for the rest of the music being such a new style. I was disappointed with this new release, I was expecting the songs to be like FLO, or at least one of em to be like FLO, or PADRINO, of the FONZ, but if your a first time Smash Mouth fan then this is a good buy, if not, just wait to hear them on the radio or buy the single : ) THEIR FIRST CD WAS A PUT THE HOOD DOWN AND CRANK IT UP CD, BUT THIS ONE HAS MORE SLOWER SONGS : ( AND I DIDNT REALLY LIKE IT. THANX, PEACE"
5,"I Can't Get Enough of You, Astro Lounge","Smash Mouth's sophmore cd is finally out. i met them in their private listening party for the debut of the cd and when they sang the songs on the cd live, i knew this would be an instant hit. lotsa good beats and great sounds Smash Mouth is going to dominate the radio waves again."
1,Ashamed,"I would be ashamed to own this record (luckily, I borrowed it from a friend and was able to promptly give it back). I felt like tossing this CD in the garbage. I eagerly anticipated smashmouth's follow up to their brilliant debut, a punk infested album that remains one of my favorite. And instead I hear a travesty of an album, each song provoking ponderous expressions (such as ""why would they...what were they...?). At best this album would present a laugh, if not for the inexplicable demise and sell-out of a once promising, passionate band."
3,okay,"the cd was ok. fush yu mang was better, everything on their cd sounds the same. stoned and home are pretty good, but everything else was mediocre. the last one had a lot more diversity, everything sounds the same on this one."
4,"If you like Smashmouth, this cd {KICKS A**!}","This is the ulltimate Smashmouth cd! There's quite a few hits on it. Of course if you dont like Smashmouth......... Well then you wont buy it and you wouldnt be on this site. Anyway, the booklet inside the cover is really cool. I has a silver woman in a bikini, with like orange hair. Pretty freaky stuff. Anyway if you like Smashmouth get this FREAKING cd!Review by Michael Peters. Thanks for reading!"
1,not good,I agree with Bick because this CD simply does not live up to smash mouth's previous CD. It must be a San Francisco thang.
2,ouch,"smash mouth USED to be a good band...i dont know why they ever came out with this garbage...a friend at a radio station let me hear it, and i was gravely dissapointed...buy their first CD."
2,"energy is good, but excessive happiness nerve-wrecking","energetic, yes. this is good. but smash mouth gets annoyingly happy to me. of all of the songs on this album (and trust me, my little brother insists on playing all of them above my music), not one of them is depressing, or emotional. so that special journey that many artists can take you on is all but non-existant. Not to mention 'All Star' started to get on my nerves the 3rd time i heard it..."
1,Horrid!,"This is what NME had to say about Smashmouth: ""...here is a band that actually enjoy being everything you hate in music all at the same time. While looking like particularly frightening security guards."" I rest my case."
4,retro supreme,"This is great! If you like anything by the Zombies or the whole retro scene then you'll like this. I thought All-Star was good, but the reverb theme is even better."
2,Sell-outs!,"Well, Smash Mouth has sold out. They had it going with Fush Yu Mang, but Astro Lounge just can't compare. There was only one song I didn't like on Fush Yu Mang, while Allstar and Then The Morning Comes are the only ones I liked on Astro Lounge. Smash Mouth looked at the success of Walkin' On The Sun, and then tryed to do a whole CD in that genre. They only succeeded with Allstar and Then the Morning Comes. So, if you're expecting and want a CD like Fush Yu Mang, don't buy this. Likewise, if you just have to have Allstar or Then the Morning Comes, buy the single. Soft rock just doesn't work these people. Go back to hard rock, Smash Mouth. It's what you do best."
3,i recommend it,"I really like this album. Its definelty an improvement over Fush Yu Mang. What I think about each song:1. ""Who's there"" so-so. a little slow2. ""Diggin' Your Scene"" Great! Catchy!3. ""I just wanna See"" Okay. sounds like their preaching4. ""Waste"" I don't like it, but somebody might.5. ""All Star"" I luv it! Although i think it was way over played on the radio and in movies.6. ""Satellite"" pretty good.7. ""radio"" so-so8. ""Then the Morning Comes"" Really good- sounds like it should be in a Bond movie or something9. ""Road Man"" Good! Sounds Hawaiian-ish. Tells you not to speed, but sad because the road man dies.10. ""Fallen Horses"" same as 411. ""Defeat You"" Great!12. ""Come on, Come on"" Good!13. ""Home"" I think they could do better. The chorus is pretty good though.14. ""Cant get enough of you baby"" I liked it but it gets boring after a while.All in all: good! It is pretty serious with all this environmental and social stuff and teaches you good lessons but at the same time- lots of fun!"
2,good at first,I have had this cd for a while now and realized it got old pretty fast. All-star got old too. If you like all star just record it off the radio (its on all the time) or buy the single.
1,Don't draw conclusions,"So I was in the record store and I was like, ""Hey, well I like All-star a lot and I liked their other singles ok, why not buy this?"" I could barely even get past the first three songs, as I gradually realized my mistake...Basically, they got pretty full of themselves, and it shows in their music."
1,Just a waste of money,"I picked up the CD for the song ""All Star"".It was okay for about a week,then it got annoying."
4,i love smashmouth's astrolounge!,"astrolounge is great, however smashmouth needs to keep putting out great hits from their album, if they don't do that or they don't get another good album out then they're going to go out of style. ""all-star"" was great and so was ""and then the morning comes"" but they need to keep putting those albums and songs out."
3,this cd is ok,"this is an ok cd. it had a couple of good songs, but nothing great. i mostly bought it because of ""all star"" a very good song. but other then that, the only songs i liked were, ""come on come on"" and ""i cant get enough of you baby"". I think they could have put in some more upbeat songs like ""all star"". it didnt have many catchy songs like i thought it would. I would probably just recommend buying singles of the good songs."
3,"more than one hit wonders, but how much more ?","Smash Mouth is a good new band. their stylings of 60's music, funk and various other musical styles make for a unique sound. The lyrics however somehow escape me. Alot of songs get on the radio and people learn the words and dont give much thought as to what theyre reciting. Their music is catchy enough and good enough to get them by but in the lyrics department, there is room for improvement and maturity on future albums. This is a good album to have and to listen to for the good music."
4,A new sound. Cool changes. Good phrasing. Thought out !,"Heavy freakin sigh. Somebody ( SMASHMOUTH ) is finally doing something original. I am sooo tired of the "" GARAGE BAND "" ( They know who they are ) music on the FM dial. I am a musician myself , and I appriciate chord progressions and phrasing. They have an "" ORIGINAL "" sound to their music. Good Album Guys."
4,Great second effort. . .,"Most of the time when a band trys to get back into the big scene with a sophomore CD, its a big flop. Not many make it that far. But Smash Mouth has done it, and with style. Already with three hits off of it. Its a personal fav-of-the-year for me."
2,astro crap,"So Smash Mouth can write hooky songs that get stuck in your head. Well, Juicy Fruit commercials also get stuck in my head and I don't consider them musical brilliance. This album isn't horrific, but it's simply boring, repetitive, derivative, and fluffy. Sure it makes an OK soundtrack to a party, but there's nothing earth-shattering here. Typical here-today-gone-tomorrow pop fare. In a decade no one will remember who these guys are."
4,Easy to listen to,"If you buy this CD for ""All Star"" then you're the kind of person who will love a lot of the songs on the album. ""Radio"", ""Who's There"", ""Come On, Come On"", ""Stoned"", and ""Then the Morning Comes"" all are good sounding songs and are easy to listen to. If you don't like their music at first, it just might grow on you...that's what happened to me."
3,Not my best CD,"I hate the outer-space lyrics and sounds,but the songs are okay. All-Star, Defeat you, and come on, Come on are the best."
3,So-so,"Hey. This CD has some really awesome songs such as ""who's there"",""all star"" and ""come on come on"" but it also has some songs that aren't that great like ""waste"" and ""satellite."" That's why I gave it right in the middle. I do think though that it is a CD that you should go out of your way to get."
3,Pretty damn good...but not great.,"Best song was the opening number called ""Who's There"", and many other great songs such as my 2nd fav ""Then The Morning Comes"" and ""Diggin Your Scene"". Some songs are a bit tedious, but enjoyable. ""All Star"" is pretty much the least inspired song on the album, and is my nominee for the worst song on the album, but even so it is still enjoyable, just loses flavor when it is mixed with better songs. 3 stars"
3,Smash Mouth astro lounge.. slightly dissopionting,"Well it is ok i guess. It really sordo stinks in ways. Only one good song ""All star"" but it is a very good song so i gave it a 3."
1,This CD has hippie written all over it.,The music from Smash Mouth's latest album lacks everything Fush Yu Mang was. I loved their earlier album and this one is just sorry. They took out the variety and originality of music from the earlier album and replaced it with a bunch of hippie loving music. And what was Road Man trying to prove. Oh and Diggin' Your Scene made me want to hurl.
2,Very Dissapointed,"I very much enjoyed the first smash mouth album, but this one is not nearly as good as no. 1. Every song sounds like ""Walkin' on the Sun"", which in my opinion, is one of the worst songs on the disc. That stupid organ noise drives me nuts."
3,sort of ok-good,"This isn't exactly my favorite Smash Mouth Album, but its not all that horrible. It has more rock to it than Smash Mouths Self titled Cd, but it has moved away from the Ska catagory and more into pop rock. They hadn't sold out all the way yet... but they would."
4,"Well-worth the price, guarenteed.","""Astrolounge"" is Smash Mouth's best release, it's good-sounding, not explicit. However, I should suggest using more instruments to these guys."
5,Suppa Good!,"I love Smash Mouth! This album is really good, better than their 1st one. I loved most of these songs. Some I thought were boring, but the good ones made up for that. If I were you, I'd buy this album! When their 3rd album comes out, I am totally certain I'll buy it!"
3,"Simply put......""Pop"" music!","Here is some simple, fun, ""pop"" music from SoCal. Nothing special or brillant about it. Smash Mouth isn't deep, meaningful music just a good time."
2,not as good as I thought,"I bought this album for ""all star"" thinking the other 14 tracks would be just as good, boy was I wrong, with the exception of ""waste"" and ""can't get enough of you baby"" this album is trash I'm now looking to sell it, but that's just my opinion and other people might think differently."
5,Rock fan from NY,"I love this CD. I originally bought it just for all-star, but then i listened to the CD for the first time and loved every song on the CD. The songs Defeat You, Who's There, and Can't Get Enough of You Baby are all great songs. No song on this is bad, they all have lively good beats. Many albums such as Barenaked Ladies or Third Eye Blind have some quiet songs (which aren't always bad such as ""Call and Answer"" and ""How's it Gonna Be"") but in this album, all of the songs are lively and energetic. I liked this album so much that I immediately bought Smashmouth's old album which has Walkin' on the Sun. I liked that album but not as much. If you can't decide which Smashmouth to get, buy Astro Lounge."
4,Lots of fun!,"I bought this album because I enjoyed listening to All Star. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the entire album was fun and easy to listen to. Some of the songs have a retro feel (""Can't Get Enough of You, Baby""), and some are just a blast to sing along to (""Roadman""). This is an album that won't disappoint."
4,a must buy c.d.,"I bought this c.d. because of All Star. But the other songs are graet too. But, as good as Astrolounge is, it doesn't beat Fush Yu Mang,"
5,The bomb!!,"When you get this Cd, you get a ton of great songs! my favorite is Come on come on or who's there. oh yeah and in all star the thing that the guy says is all that glitter is gold figure that out on your own!"
4,it's an all-star cd,"smash mouth's song all-star is the greatest, that's about the only song that i like from them, because it's there best one!!!"
3,"HYPE, HYPE, and more HYPE","When this band isn't trying to re-invent the '60's, they manage to crank out a mixture of this style and that style. And whoever buys this CD for ""All-Star"" has to admit that it is one of the lyrically weakest songs on the air. Smash Mouth should be happy that at least their fans make them out to be more talented than they really are."
3,Astro Lounge kicks ***,"It wasa totally great CD with lots of good songs. Its definately my favorite CD next to ""Fush Yu Mang"" I highly reccomend it."
4,Good record with catchy beats,I was suprised at this cd. All the sonds are upbeat and laid back. They all sound good. Not as good as there first CD but still a good cd. I recomend it to all fans.
2,Too Little,"Some of the songs were pretty novel, but I mean, two of the songs (I am not sure how many, but know there are some) were actually on the other cd! PLus many of the songs were stupid. All-Star and Then The Mourning comes are great, though!"
2,gone way downhill,"there are only about four good songs this cd(stoned,come on come on and a few others) i dont like this cd nearly as much as fush yu mang or the east bay sessions if you like more aggresive punk/ska get one of those 2 if you like pop get this i just didnt want anyone to get this and be dissapointed becouse it sounds nothing like their previous work , i was dissapointed when i listend to it for the first time, after a while it is ok though."
3,For Die Hard only,"If you are a die hard Smash Mouth fan, buy AstroLounge. If not,I would pass on this one. All Star is a great song, but the rest of the album is a little dull. For the die hard fan only"
5,I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT,IM A BIG FAN OF YOUR ALLSTAR. YOUR MUSIC VIDEO IS THE BEST IVE SEEN. WHEN YOUR SONGS COME ON 92.7 KISS FM I GO NUTS.
5,The best this summer,"Having a very picky opinion of music I think that its rare nowadays to find an entire CD that completely rocks! This CD is by far the best thing that has come out in months. Their sound is like noone else, the lyrics are relatable and their style makes you want to jump in the car, open up all the wondows and drive for hours at a time. I suggest this album for anyone who likes to turn up the radio and sing as loud as they can!!!!"
3,Think About It First,"I almost bought the album ""AstroLounge"", but decided against it as of right now. The song ""All-Star"" is very awsome, but it's not worth buying the cd. If you are considering buying this album you might think about it for a minute first. The best ones on it are ""all-star"" and ""cant get enough of you baby. You can buy the single of ""all-star"" for a lot less and then you can buy the soundtrack to ""Can't Hardly Wait"" which includes the hit song ""Can't Get Enough of you Baby"" plus other good ones like ""blink 182"", and ""Guns N Roses"". Of course if i didn't have the soundtrack already i might consider buying the cd. The choice is yours!"
3,Pretty Good,"Although I am not a die hard fan of Smash Mouth, I found this CD to be only so-so. The other CD was a bit better, but it is probably hard to top the previous single ""Walkin on the Sun"" The single ""All Star"" is very good, and catchy, but it isn't enough to carry the CD to the top, there are couple of other good songs, but that isn't worth buying. If you like All Star you would probably be better off buying that single. But if you are truly a fan of Smash Mouth, you might enjoy this CD. The lyrics aren't quite as creative as the previous cd. Maybe if they had put a little more thought into this cd, it could have created a masterpeice, but anyone who just likes the one song will be cataclysmically bored with the rest. So to sum this up, save your money and go for a cd which is worth every penny."
5,great cd,wat upthis is greatread my other review for the other smashmouthits the same as thismy favorite smashmouth cd
1,These guys are awful,"What drugs are being sniffed by fans of this group? The music has absolutely nothing to it. If the second release becomes a hit, then I am confident that all of the listeners are sheep, and will listen to just about anybody. I think it's time to shoot this lame cow and get some taste."
2,"Name's cool, music's awful","ATTENTION--If you know of and believe the fact that money doesn't grow on trees and you can't waste it, don't buy this C.D., O.K.? Want an explanation? Fine, then. Get ready. Only two songs on this C.D. are good-All Star and Then the Morning Comes. The rest are go-into-the-corner -and-curse-yourself -for-spending-$$-on-it material. You can't even understand half the words, and all the songs sound the same. I'm so happy that Amazon and Best Buy let you listen to C.D.s before you buy them; otherwise, I would've gotten this album and would've been really unhappy. If you want some good rock with some hip-hop songs mixed in, buy 14:59 instead. THAT'S a great C.D. (F.Y.I., It's by Sugar Ray.)"
1,What radio and tv commercial does NOT use that song??,"The song I speak of is ""All Star"". It has been played a billion times in movies, television and radio commercials that sell everything from insurance to automobiles. The song is not even good. The rest of the CD is bland nu-alternative. Smash mouth is the definition of ""sellout""."
1,withold smashmouth forever,I dont know if I've ever listened to an album that has annoyed me more. Period. I would rate it lower if I could but low is as low as you can go on here.
5,Extraordinary CD,"If the first CD by Smash Mouth that you've owned was Fush yu Mang, this will seem very different compared to it. If you only like the punkish style that was on Fush yu Mang, you might not like this CD much, but if you like many types, as I do, you'll find this CD to be very good. I own all of the Smash Mouth CDs, and I love them all. The song 'Come on, Come on' is also featured in the album 'The East Bay Sessions' but with slightly different lyrics and music. I have found it very hard to decide which one I like better...Anyway, Astro Lounge is Smash Mouths second album, with the hit singles 'All Star' and ""Then the Morning Comes,"" which are the reasons I bought that album in the first place. And once I listened to every other song, I found that I loved it. Some songs took a few listens before I really got into it, as music often does for me, but if you can get me to 'get into the music', then you've accomplished something great..."
2,Gets old really quick,"Overall this cd is filled with low quality music. Yes, there are some hit songs on this cd BUT (Trust me on this one) they do get old very quickly. then what?, your left with a bunch of bad music and some old songs.Save yourself $. Don't buy this cd."
4,All Around Sweet,This album is a good buy. Different from their first CD. They have a newer sound to them. All Star is a great song. The rest of the CD is all around uplifting and fun. I suggest you get this one.
5,Good Cd. :0),I think *All Star* is the best song on the Cd But I also think *Roadman* is good too.......Its a good Friday after work song.Good Work ~~~*Smash * Mouth*~~~
5,Love it!,"Smash Mouth has grown up and for the better! While their first album was semi-punk rock, this one weaves great lyrics with awesome chord progressions and melodies which evoke a beatle-esque atmosphere at times without trying. I love all of the songs, and you will too!"
3,"2 are really tight, the rest all sound the same","This album is kinda cool. I like the like title, but only 2 of the songs. The best ones are 'Allstar' and 'I can't get enough of you baby.' I totally love 'Allstar!' W/the rest of the songs, the words are kinda mixed together. I think you should just buy the single of 'Allstar,' but if you can afford to buy a CD w/just two tight songs on it, go ahead.Chow. peace! {=o)"
5,Smash Mouth's Best Yet!,"This is unquestionably Smash Mouth's Best album. If only The East Bay Sessions was as good as this. I looked at some of the other reviews and noticed that a lot of reviewers were about 7-11 years old. Why curse for all your worth if your albums are aimed towards that age level. I've heard plenty of eleven curse in my life, but all the same, what parents going to buy there little 7-11 year old kid an album that has the ""Parental Advisory"" Sticker in the corner? This album has no explicit content whatsoever, and this is probably the album that earned Smash Mouth so many younger fans. Fu Shu Mang and The East Bay Sessions are fine, but with the age level of fans, I think they'd sell more CDs if the left out the explicit stuff. Its a great album, the best track is probably Who's There. This easily comes to my mind as Smash Mouths best. I just wish all the other Smash Mouth Albums were like this."
3,"Decent, radio-friendly pop","Hmmm, I think Smash Mouth and their Record Company sat down and the record company said ""Well boys, remember that one song on your last record that did really well?"" and Smash Mouth said ""yep."" The record company than noted ""Well, you guys still wanna have lots of money, beer, and girls right?"" and the boys of the Smash Mouth quickly responded ""Of course."" So the record company then said, ""Well then, make this new record all sound like that one song."" And then, Astro Lounge was born."
3,"not as bad, but still a disappointment","Okay, so I will little harsh in my first review when I called them sell-outs. I still think they have changed their music for the worse, but as I listened to Astro Lounge a few times, I realized it's not a bad album. Smash Mouth does have a way with poppy songs. There are a few songs, such as Stoned, Come On, Come On, and Waste, Allstar, Then Morning Comes that make it worth buying. If you lack feel-good walking tunes, Astro Lounge is a perfect CD. I'm not the kind who digs that, but hey, lots of people need this kind of music, and I was wrong for originally having a beef with that."
5,Loved It!,"This Smash Mouth CD is the best CD I've ever had! Every single song on that CD is a hit! I stongly recommend this CD to any rock fan, it ROCKS!"
5,proves there 1st one wasnt a fluke,I think this CD is great it shows they have talent. It's a great up to the beat dancing rock song with grrovvyyy sounds and good playing. It gives a new kinda beat to the techno/rock music
5,Smashing!,"Astrolounge is a smash hit! Rarely can one find such an upbeat, summery cd filled with fast songs, catchy tunes, and insightful lyrics. If you want a cd to keep you singing all day long, this is it!"
1,Boring. A barely warmed-over rehash of the previous CD.,"I liked the previous album, I really did. A lot. OK, so ""Walking on the Sun"" was a great song, and it would have been tough to come up with another that good, but nothing here is even remotely in that league. Instead, everything here sounds drearily the same. And I know that sounds like something your parents say, but read the first line again. Even the now obligatory cover doesn't sound as fresh as the one on the earlier CD. So go buy that one if you don't already have it, but stay away from this one."
5,It Kicks Butt,"If you loved ""Walking on the Sun"",you will love this.""All Star"" in my opinion,is the best.I love ""All Star"",and so will you!!!!!!"
3,"great except ""All Star""","Very good album. It loses a star for including ""All Star"", which was crap the first time I heard it and which is still crap now that you can't get away from it. Otherwise, a decent album... still, gotta agree with the others, ""Fush Yu Mang"" was better."
5,A great CD,"Full of catchy, fun, thoughtful songs that rank high in entertainment and musicianship. You won't be disappointed!"
3,It's Certainly Worth A Look,"I remember when I first heard Smash Mouth- they were playing the song ""Walkin' on the Sun"". I know that this song was pop, and I am traditionally anti-pop, but this song was really cool. This album is a great follow up to those cool beginnings, and it is worth a listen or two.First of all, just the fact that Smash Mouth is more than a one-hit-wonder is a pleasant surprise. They do have some talent, as you can see in their album ""Astro Lounge"". There are several good songs on Astro Lounge, including the ever popular ""All Star"". For people looking for some hip music that borders on alternative, this is a good pick.The reason I didn't give it five stars, though, is because the album is often uneven. Some songs are very good and enjoyable, but others just aren't up to par, and are just too long.In short, this is a fairly good album, but not an incredible achievment. It may, however, be a foreshadowing of greater things to come."
4,Great S.M.,This is a great disc. S.M. is truly original. Here are the track grades:1.Who's There=A+2.Diggin' Your Scene=A+3.I Just Wanna See=C4.Waste=A+5.All Star=B+6.Satellite=D+7.Radio=A-8.Stoned=B+9.Then the Morning Comes=A10.Road Man=C+11.Fallen Horses=C12.Defeat You=A-13.Come On Come On=A-14.Home=B15.Can't Get Enough of You Baby=A
4,Good!,"Smash Mouth's latests album, ""Astro Lounge"" is a good cd! 3 of the best songs are All-Star, Can't Get Enough Of You, Baby & Come On Come On. You should buy this album! A lot of the songs are cool! It's good."
4,A great cd with a few disappointments,"This is a great cd with great great music. The ""radio-friendly"" content was the biggest problem as far as I could see. By not using the language used on the last album, they were not being themselves. It is still a great cd......buy it"
1,The Same Old Stuff,"You know what makes a band great? The ability to grow in their music. Unfortunately, Smash Mouth hasn't grown at all since their less-than-stellar first album; instead, every song reeks with the ""summer time"" vibe and it gets old fast. I'm sure this album will sell millions, and Smash Mouth will find no reason to change their style. That's a real shame, because their act as it stands now belongs in a hotel lounge."
2,What happen to rock,Smash Mouth came out with a bad cd. Their best song on the cd is allstar. I would recommend people to buy the single or buy their other cd.
4,They've Lost Something,"I liked their first album. But this one is a huge step down from their punk rock days. This album is more or less pop. (Not that I don't like that okay) If your more into pop, get this. If punk rock is your thing, buy Fush Yu Mang."
2,Too Little,"This cd has too many boring songs (About too many social problems, yaddayadda...) and some songs were already on their older cd! But All-star and Then the mourning comes are good. IF you REALLY like those songs (and there are a few others ok) then check this out."
4,"A techno-alterna, dance around and have fun album","I loved ""All Star,"" so I begged for this CD for Christmas. I was surprised to find that there is a lot more to this group than ""All Star."" ""Who's There"" and ""Diggin' Your Scene"" are awesome, mosh in your room songs. Some songs I could love less, but all in all, this is a brilliantly written and produced album. These guys really know how to rock. If you want more ""All Star,"" DON'T buy this album!"
1,"now i know why they called a song on this ""waste""","i was so excited that i got this album, then left it on the table and went upstairs, when i come down, my sister is listening to it saying ""this is awful, what is this"" and i was like i dont' know, it's yours right? and she was like ""i found this on the table, smashmouth, i thought it was yours"" and i was like ""THIS is smashmouth!"" i was so dissapointed that i fell into a deep depresison as a result of this horrible music, i can't handle the world now, i am afriad to leave the house cuz i might go somewhere that they play smashmouth, and that scares me......"
1,I HATE THIS CD,"This is a really bad cd, all the songs are REALLY boring, they have no toon, they are depressing, and it is really bad......."
1,This Band Sucks,I have never heard a more horrible band in my life. People say they are fun well guess what if there fun so is getting your junk ripped off. Never ever buy this piece of crap you will be dumber after listening to it
1,A terrible album from a terrible band,"I first herd ""all star"" on VH1 on a music video in early July. It made me want to puke. I figured the American public would hate it as well but I was wrong. The music is terrible. I could get a fourth grader give him a one hour tutorial on the instruments and he could do better. On top of that, the lyrics are hard to understand and when you can understand them, they make no sense. Please don't waste your money. Let this band collapse."
1,Extreme dissapointment.,"If you were a person who bought Fush Yu Mang, and liked more songs than Walkin' on the sun, you're gonna be very dissapointed with this one. After seeing how well the pop song went over on 1st album, they made ALL the songs like that on Lounge.16 bucks for a frisbee... 'nuff said."
1,One of the worst bands I've ever herd.,I'll make this short. thisisacrappycdanditthebandishorrible. ihopethattheynevermakeanothercdagain. becauseeveryiseeitonmtviturnitoff. icantstandit. thankyouforyourtime. seeyou!
5,This is one of the best CD's of the whole century,"This CD brings out the best in Smash Mouth's whole career. Their first CD was kind of a dud except for Walkin' on the Sun. Then when this CD came out, I had to go out and buy it right away, because all of the songs on this CD rocked."
5,I love it!,"This is an awesome album! I really liked 'All Star' and thought about getting the CD. I read the reviews and decided to go for it. I made the right choice! Some people say that all of the songs sound the same. The first time you listen to it they do sound similar. But after you get to know each song, they are way different. I think everyone should get this album."
5,Astro Lounge is a really COOL cd!,"I first found out about Smash Mouth on the radio listening to All Star. I bought the cd because I liked all star and to my surprise the other songs were GREAT too! my favorites are All Star, Roadman and Then the Morning Comes. This cd ROCKS!"
3,"Very good songs, but very bad songs too.","There are many songs that are wonderful on this CD like AllStar, Then The Morning Comes, Stoned, Come On Come On, and Can't Get Enough Of You Baby. But the rest of the songs sound like fillers! They simply aren't good songs. So buy this CD if you are a Smashmouth fan, which I'm not anymore...but if you're not, just get the soundtrack to Mystery Men w/ All-Star on it...OR A MIX CD."
3,An excuse for graphic sex,"No literary genius here. If you're looking for shallow, quick fix stuff, this is for you. I didn't even finish it. No meat to the story, characters were one-dimensional. Again, written with the ""sex sells"" attitude in mind.If you want compelling, great characters with a story that will leave you a better individual for having read it - forget this one."
4,This is WILDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just sped through this book over the weekend and while it was not all that involved with a story line, Liz and Steve spice the story up a lot. I thought it would have been better had there been even a little more of a plot, but overall it was a nice, fun, light read and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for an entertaining read. Have a cold glass of something ready for yourself though, it is one HOT ride."
4,Reissue of Late 60s Xmas LP from RCA,"This is a reissue of his RCA album released in 1969. I had the RCA Camden reissue from 1971. I had this album as a child and played it ALOT. So when I saw this on CD, I had the biggest grin on my face! It is a GREAT Christmas Album, especially ""Christmas is..."". The CD also has the tracks in the correct LP order.If you're wanting to replace this album with the CD, do it!"
3,The Blooding Review,Not his best book - interesting history of the development of DNA for forensic purposes. Wambaugh is usually very socially conscious and sensitive; he comes across pretty dense in this book. Kept my interest.
3,Docudrama.,"This is a docudrama rather than a novel. It's a dramatization of the sleuthing behind the arrest of a serial killer in England, and it's chief point of interest is the first use of DNA evidence to solve a crime. Wambaugh does this sort of thing better than Truman Capote, because he's more of a storyteller; but unlike Capote, the less imagination required to tell the story, the better Wambaugh does. Here his writing is at its best, because he has little to concoct--just arrange the facts to tell the story. The story might be of more interest to students of crime than the rest of us, but it's an interesting tale and a good read. As usual, Wambaugh has trouble depicting women, less than usual, because so much is on the record and available to him. All in all, well written light reading that will consume no more than one afternoon. But the question that runs through all of his work remains: Why does he have no idea what women are like?"

5,I did not buy this and I have no idea why I have it on my review list.,I did not buy this and I have no idea why I have it on my review list.
4,LCD Wall Mount,I received the mount just a couple days after placing the order. The stud finder included was useless. My house was built in 1957 & the plaster walls are pretty thick. I had to purchase a stud finder (20.00) in order to locate the studs & install the mount. Mounting was fairly simple & the product works as advertised.
2,TilT Mount,Not truly universal. Came with no screws. Luckily I'm handy and was able to figure out a way to make it work.
3,pan and tilt no exension,"although the picture is not very clear, it does not have any extension. it will swivel aprox 20 degrees to allow viewing from an angle, and still remain close to the wall. works great with a 26 inch LCD TV."
1,Cluster Bomb,"Not at all what I ordered, nor even what I recieved.I ordered a FULL MOTION wall mount and recieved one similar to this, NOT THIS ONE.My account is telling me I ordered this one, but I did not.If I ordered this one and its not sold buy Amazon LLC, then how did I get free shipping?Sent an email to customer service 16 hours ago and they said it would be 12....have yet to hear anything.I know I got very close to what I remember ordering, because it has the same logo, and the box clearly says ""fits up to 30 inch screens,"" and this listing is only rated for up to 27"".Here is the one I ordered:Level Mount DC30SJ Full Motion Mount Fits 10-Inch to 30-Inch Televisions (Black)The one I recieved is the same brand, just no swing arm. My desk is in a corner and I NEED that part.BEWARE WHEN ORDERING WALL MOUNTS HERE!"
1,Suitable for wrapping fish,The authors make no effort to hide their contempt for Theodore Roosevelt. I was struck as I read this tripe that their hatred for TR has completely colored their ability to write a fair and honest look at the famous Rough Rider. This book is useful only if you want a good laugh.
1,Poor subject to promote liberal agenda,"I was sorely disappointed that the authors chose to use the pretext of stories about predominantly Catholic missionaries to promote their liberal bias. The Reagan bashing and Ted Kennedy praising (yes, he is a hero in this book!) demeans what should have been a tribute to eleven men and women who were unjustifiably murdered."
1,This movie is copy of VERA CRUZ gary cooper and burt lancaster,Vera Cruz was made in the 50's.It is still a outstanding movie with non stop action all the way.I have the movie you can't win em all.it is very poorly directed and has not so exciting action
3,"If you are an artillery officer, this should probably be on your bookshelf.","Continuing my tradition of mostly reviewing books that no one else has.... I picked this one up at the Museum at Fort Sill Oklahoma a number of years ago. The title is self explanatory. This is actually a pretty dry read. It does not cover the history of use or the effects of the evolution of the pieces it describes. Technical developments and tactical considerations are covered in fair detail, but the operational use and strategic impact are for the most part left out. However, as a focused book it is interesting in and of itself. If you are an artillery officer, this should probably be on your bookshelf."
1,Awful,"Cushion and comfort is great, but really these things are supposed to provide safety. The straps are virtually impossible to adjust so they fit properly, and they do cut into the childs thighs big or small. My little girl is only in the 35% for her size!"
2,Easy to install? Not in a Bravada!,"This car seat looks great, befor I put it in my car I adjusted the straps for my 8 month old and she liked it. I thought Cool. Two hours later, here I am, giving up completely. I have tried 4 different carseats, this one, 2 Gracos, and a Britax and none of them fit good in my car. My conclusion is I need to trade my 1998 Bravada in so my kid can be driven around safely. My question to everyone is if you have a Bravada and are using a rear-facing child seat and it fits wonderfully, what kind of carseat are you using? My question to automobile manufacturers, why can't I get on the internet and find a list of cars with a corrisponding list of usable and safe carseats? I did find one list, but it hadn't been updated since 1999 and the seats that work in my car are no longer made. Maybe I should try Ebay! I have tried using towels and blankets, pool tubies and all, what can I do next?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS OR THE TITAN!,"I actually bought the Titan Deluxe but this is the same exact accept the titan is the newer version. My daughter is 6 and a 1/2 months and she is only 14 lbs we only moved her up because she is to long for the infant seat now. Being so light and long she has barely any baby fat and yet this seat left red welts in her inner thighs because of the way the clip locks so low. Also I read another reviewer talking about how the setting between what they call toddlers and infant for the straps...and they are right on...my daughter at ONLY 6 months was to big for the infant setting but yet it was to loose in the toddler. We have 3 daughters and this is the first time my husband has ever had trouble with installation so that should tell you something about this seat. We have only had it 3 days and it is going back to the store. In conclusion, if I didn't want my money back I would have already thrown it out in traffic!"
3,Not worth the money,I bought this car seat for my 8mo old. It seemed really nice at first it has a lot of cushion and fit well in my Windstar. But when I put her in it the lap buckles come down across her thighs and cut into her legs (she is only 17 pounds). It says it reclines but she is still sitting almost upright and her head always falls to her chest when she sleeps. The straps twist easily and are hard to adjust from the rear facing position. I am taking it back and I'm on the search for a better seat.
1,Same at Titan Delux - Don't buy it.,"I bought this car seat after reading the Consumer Report Reviews that the Titan 5 was so great. It's possible that the base model Titan is better, but it looked very uncomfortable to me, and we are in the car a lot, so I went for the delux model. The leg straps are possitioned really badly, they go over the baby's thighs, not their hips. I have a very tall 5 month old, and he was really too big for it in the rear facing position as well. I brought it back and got the Triumph 5 - and that seems much better."
5,GET WITH THE WICKED,The UK wasnt ready for Richard Blackwood his cd is tight.People say his music is like Will Smith but thats not true.Richard has his own styleBuy this cd
4,Pretty Good,"Well this was for a fact a really good album, in my own words. It helped me to concentrate better on my work too."
5,Very Relaxing,This music does not make you sleepy. It is just kind of peaceful. I often listen to it at my desk.
4,summer solitude,these songs if you call them that are very relaxing. i would say these songs last too long but i have some that last 60-80 minutes long! these 2 songs on summer solitude last roughly 30 minutes.
3,"pretty good, but difficult mouse commands","We have several Reader Rabbit titles. Our kids, ages 4 and 5, have benefitted greatly from them. However, this title has a poor mouse interface. It is very difficult to operate, and requires obscure keyboard commands to do what is needed. As an adult, even after a detailed reading of the instructions, I found it impossible to operate the interface, and was quite upset and frustrated. Overall, I would advise a potential buyer to consider RR Toddler (great), Kindergarten and 1st Grade (Excellent), but to look further for a 2nd grade software product."
3,not what i ordered,"i bought the cooler with the ""B"" for Boston as the logo... but was mailed the one with the two ""red sox"" logo instead. i contacted the seller by email to try and correct it but they NEVER got back to me. it was for my son and he would have preferred the one i ordered but i didn't have time to fight this futher. i think the product is nice, but am disappointed we didnt get the one we ordered."
3,FYODOR UNWRAPPED,"This is a book (actually the first volume of a 2-volume set) forDostoevsky aficianados. There is some very interesting and varied material in this large volume -- essays, imaginings, journalism, polemic, short stories, propoganda, rants, etc.. A kind of 'Fyodor Unwrapped.' It helps to have read other books by this great Russian Master, particularly his 'Big 5': Crime & Punishment,The Idiot, The Devils, A Raw Youth, Brothers Karamavoz. The translation by Kenneth Lantz is excellently done; the extensive Introduction by Gary Saul Morsom, is helpful, butdefinitely 'over kill.'The book, in fact, is a microcosm of Dostoevsky himself: plenty of flaws and foolishness, but always worth plowing through. He is, after all, probably the world's greatest novelist, and I recommend this book highly to those who agree with that assessment."
4,Back in the day...,"This book is like a walk through the history of broadcasting. The names that were so familiar to us ""baby boomers"" pop up at every turn. If you watched the news on TV in the 50's, this is the book for you."
4,Must read for non hunters as well as hunters,Dr. Samuel is a contributer to articles in BowHunter magazine and the reason why I picked up this book. In this book he tells it like it is in such a way that I believe non hunters should read and understand what I feel as a hunter.
3,Decent book. Lot's of facts.,Book is chucked full of facts and statistics it is kinda long and mostly is showing the good that hunting provides to people and to the wildlife being managed.
5,Beautiful,"We searched for months for a ""special"" doorknob leading to a very special room in our house. But we didn't want to spend a fortune for a doorknob! The Sonata Crystal Passage Lockset turned out to be a perfect blend of beauty and price -- something we call ""value."""
4,this album has also energy!,"Sir Robert from australia & many other PURPLE fans did not understand about this album,...the Gig was actually pretty good, but the album was produced in a bad way. The album lacked of the sound what DP played. Martin birch (Purple recording engineer long time ago) was too worried with the sound what Tommy Bolin played, he engineered this live album with a bad production in the studio, because he was affraid that many purple fans will be desperate to hear Bolin did not play like Blackmore. That is the main problem here! The next re-released of Last concert in Japan will include some rare songs which were not included to this cd. The title will be called ""This time around Tokyo 1975"" on a double cd set. And the Bolin's guitar sound will be remastered from the original tape and sounding more sharper than this one. I'm sure the new re-released is the best enthusiastic for DP fans."
3,Decent,"This album is kind of a mixed bag. It has some good performances and some not-so-good performances. Tommy Bolin was by no means a crap guitarist, but is stylistically very different to Blackmore. For instance, he performs beautifully on ""Wild dogs"", but on ""Highway Star"" its clear that the song needs Blackmore's incendiary rifferry and whammy bar technique.I'm not saying the Mk IV lineup is necessarily inferior to the ""classic"" Mk II, its just that they are better suited to a certain style of music. Mk II era songs tend to sound better when performed by Mk II, just like Mk IV songs sound better when performed by that lineup (although I dont think Mk II have ever done Mk IV era songs, but you know what I mean).In conclusion, this album has some very fine moments, and some very mediocre moments. This is for die-hard fans, for anyone else I'd recommend ""Made In Japan"" and ""Made In Europe""."
3,"Tommy Bolin era, not bad","according to some reviews in this room,...someone from Vienna said that this live album was not very excelllent, I would like to say and give 3 stars,..though Tommy bolin was stoned on stage at that night in Tokyo 1975, I still enjoy his version on WILD DOGS. Long Live DP"
2,NOT VERY GOOD!,"I know as ahuge DP immortal FAn, I love the performance from MARK IV either, but I have to admit that this one is not the best DP TOP FORM on stage. TOMMY BOLIN was brilliant but he just could not help him self on stage the day he played in Japan 1975,...this live album could not win the succesfull of Made in Japan 1972. I have this album on cd and LP but only as a collector. Need I say more???"
2,"Nice pics, but words preachy","This book has a color photo on one page with a phrase under it and on the facing page it has a paragraph. For example: Page 26: ""All of our nine lives are happier when we watch out for one another. Treat others as you wish to be treated. You may not have met them all yet, but SVOs (Special Valued Others) are present in your life - charish them."" They do not all have ""cat"" slants (Nine lives). The paragraphs are very much ""Self help"" type. The photos are cute and get five stars, but the words are a little too preachy so two stars overall. I prefer books like ""What Kittens Are"", ""Zen Cat"", ""What Cats Teach Us"", ""Cat Naps"",etc."
3,Interesting and informative,"Overall a good book about why people come to believe in certain things and a good read to help sharpen your critical thinking skills.Two criticisms however. The author's speculation on the historical Jesus while interesting is no more provable than any of the assertions by many others over the years.More significant however is the assertion that he and many other secular humanists make that one should just enjoy the life you have and live it to the fullest. While that may sound good from the author's priviliged position as a member of the middle class in a western nation, that kind of assertion must surely sound hollow and meaningless to a starving kid in Africa."
5,Early Days - A Different Sound,"If you have only heard the Lindsey Buckingham/Stevie Nicks version of Fleetwood Mac, you are missing why this band has held together through many various formations, and also why Peter Green was present when Fleetwood Mac was indoctrinated to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. A different, bluesy period of the band, jamming with other now famous stars. Only better than the more well known line up if you are strictly a blues listener. The earlier versions of Fleetwood Mac are stungingly good. When I began to recreate my music collection in CD version, I focused more on Fleetwood Mac from 1975 to the present. I had forgotten what a different sound they used to have, and how good that sound was. If you like music of the 60's and 70's, you will enjoy this."
5,exactly what I needed,Used this to add extension hose to power washer. Hooked two hoses together and now do not need to move power washer to do most jobs. No loss of pressure that I could tell.
4,NorthStar Hose to Hose Coupler for power washer,The coupler was an item I was looking for - for quite some time and was please to find it at Amazon. It was a fair price and I received in a timely manner.
2,doesn't fit old style washers,didn't work for hubbies pressure washer. didn't fit. specifications should of been more clearly stated on what years and brands this could be used on.
2,a little work,the coupler fits the extension hose. but it does not fit the original hose that came with the faip 1500 psi power washer. time to go to home depot. well not really i just honed it out until it fit. just a little work
4,Level,"This level is highly accurate, convenient, and comfortable. My only complaint is the price, but if it lasts as long as it's supposed to, it will be a worthwhile investment."
3,interesting,"it shows an interesting look at orndorffs carrer,but ,it does'nt show many of his biggest matches or early stuff."
3,Back to You and Me,"To much drama with sad parts. I would not buy this again. My wife likes it though, but she will have to watch it with her gal friends, not me."
4,Wonderful Actors and very good story!,"I've seen this movie a number of times and liked it very much, but I don't seem to have it in my DVD movie collection."
5,Back to Yo and Me,"This film demonstrates the two most important things in life: love and forgiveness. It also contrasts the lives of two doctors, one who takes the medical profession as just an every day job; the other who is professional in every respect but warm and caring. Lisa Hartman Black and Dale Midkiff demonstrate the kind of romance and true love that many in our present generation need to witness and experience, when selfishness and unrestricted sex today are destroying relationships, especially in marriage and the family. Thank you once again, Larry Levinson."
2,"Disappointing, low-budget effort","The producers of this DVD did not have much of a budget for clips, which sort of hampers one when one is creating a documentary about vintage films. There are a few brief clips, apparently licensed from Turner, of 1929-vintage films that have been issued on LD or DVD, but other films from the era are represented by clips from their public-domain trailers! As for ""performances by Sophie Tucker, Al Jolson.."", yes, you will see performances... FROM NEWSREELS! Also in the public domain. I think you get the picture. This is a low-budget effort that will disappoint most film buffs."
5,my kids' favorite,"My children LOVED this book, they read it and reread it and now the pages are falling apart. It is a beautiful story written by an amazing author. Adults and kids alike will enjoy this, it is a keeper!!!!!!!!!"
3,listening for a good book review,"Rachel is a girl who lives in Africa. Her parents died from influenza and a rich family decided to replace her for their dead daughter. They sent her to her ""grandfather"" in England to pretend to be someone she is not to get his wealth.In England she and her grandfather bond together and have fun. But then a couple months later the Pritchard's come to England to pick up their Rachel, and make sure she got her job done. Rachel feels bad about lying so much to her ""grandfather"". But she doesn't want the Pritchards to get mad at her and punish her. Will she tell her grandfather the truth?In the beginning of the book, Rachel was shy and obedient. But over time she became bolder. It must be hard to pretend to be someone your not. I would not want to be in her position where I had no opinion. I recommend this book to people who like adventure because in this book, Rachel's life is full of adventure."
5,AWESOME STORY,"This book is a HISTORY LESSON wrapped up beautifully in a story. I couldn't stop reading and FEELING for the people in the story plot, it had lots of twists and turns and gave great insight to what the African people actually go through but told in a way that it doesn't leave the reader feeling hopeless and it also was a great MORAL story on trying to choose between money or love and courage or selfishness---just an EXCELLENT STORY all the way around."
1,Serving the GW Conservative Agenda,"Great disappointment... particularly on Global Warming. The author should drop the cheap quasi-scientific bubbles of the conservative anti-GW establishment and go read some real science. Less science should not ""balance"" good science merely to serve petty political correctness. I recommend to the author attention to the frequent publications of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It has been established by WMO and UNEP to assess scientific, technical and socio- economic information relevant for the understanding of climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.1 star for the cartoon work."
5,Environmental Science and Cartoons,"Great book as a break from the normal Environmental science textbooks. A funny and informative look at many of the key ideas and concepts related to environmental science. Many of the cartoons are also useful for teaching biological science. Don't be fooled, some of the cartoons demonstrate fairly advanced ideas, but in a humerous and entertaining fashion."
3,Not his best!,"Graham Bonnet is still one of the greatest singers in the world. Unfortunately by the credits in the album, he neither wrote nor produced anything on this album. The sound is not very consistent. Some songs you can hardly hear Bonnet. On some songs the guitar is very prominent and others you wonder if they are just playing with bass and drums. I would say there are 4 or 5 good songs on this one. I was very disappointed by the album but only because my expectations are so high when it comes to the great one. Still a very good album for Graham fans, just can't compare to albums like Stand in Line, Dangerous Games and Assault Attack. This really seems more like a Danny Johnson solo album with Graham singing on it."
1,unreadable with Typos,"If I had known this copy was purposely left unedited and full of typos I would not have purchased. I struggled to overlook them but the book was unreadable. Unfortunately, by the time I gave up and sought a better copy, none were available and I missed my class. This should have been stressed upfront... in fact, why would anyone WANT an unreadable copy?"
1,Very Disappointing - Shockingly Bad,"This video is one of the worst videos we have seen yet. The animation is poor at best, the story line about a little boy and girl who travel back in time to see Samson, a true strong man, goes awry right from the beginning when the boy lies about lifting weights. We thought this was going to be a ""Christian"" video for children, but were stunned to see (within the first few minutes of the video), a robot who ""shoots"" some ""bad/mean"" Philistines for ""roughing up"" Samson's Mother. Then, the show only got worse when Samson met Delilah and Delilah began to speak -- and sounded exactly like Mae West, ""Big Boy"" and all. That Delilah portrayal was the last straw, we shut it off. Truly disappointing. Poor quality, obviously not written or produced by Christians."
3,What price for Nostalgia.,"Play this when after hours of newer games, you want to remember what gaming used to be like.Installation was like you remembered. A very ""hands on"" type of thing.Graphics encourage you to use more of your imagination than many newer titles.Audio. Just the sounds of vintage aircraft and lots of explosions. Music? erm.. yeah, kind of.It's a good title and a great trip into the past."
2,OP SYS.,"Check your compatibility before purchase. I bought this set for Lock On Air Combat alone, and it didn't work on either of my computers."
5,You can't get better then these.,"I bought this set in 1999. Use them everyday. They have taken alot of abuse over the years, but are still accurate. You can't get a better warranty. A must for any door installer. My crew and I love them."
5,What a magnetic personality,"We all know that Stabila makes the best levels in the world, but this new magnetic jamber set is killer. The magnets are incredible. I even used the 78"" level on a wood door frame and Stabila was smart enough to line up the magnets to line up with the door hinges. I was able to work on a wood door frame hands free. This is an incredible set of levels. Any professional worth their salt needs to have this set. Stabila rocks!"
4,nice set of levels,"I love this set of levels, the magnets are nice when setting doors. They do line up with the hinges on a wood jamb too. I gave them 4 stars since the 32"" level is not quite dead nuts level. It is about 1/64"" inch off, which doesn't affect it much. I figured I would use it and with Stabila's great return policy if it gets worse, I will send it in."
2,It worked until it broke.,"I bought this for my mom. It worked okay for a summer, trapping mosquitoes, moths, and flies--though not all of them (still, even one dead mosquito equals fewer bites, so we were happy with the unit). But then about four months after we bought it, it made a loud zap/snap noise and died. I thought the bulb was blown, so I bought one at the local light bulb store (almost seven bucks!) to no avail. Something in the electrical system was shot, I guess. I wish I could recommend it, but I can't. I'm going to try buying another brand or kind."
4,Sucks up mosquitos like a hoover vacuum,"We bought one of these units because mosquitos kept getting into our bedroom and buzzing around at night biting us.The first night that we used it, it trapped 4 mosquitos. You cannot imagine the satisfaction of seeing them trapped in the machine. We have had the unit for 3 years. We only use it when we see a mosquito buzzing around in our room (seasonally). But every time we see one, we know that it will be in the trap the next morning.Put the unit far away from your bed and face it away from you because the light is bright and the fan is noisy, but it is like beautiful white noise knowing that the stupid mosquitos will be inside the trap and not buzzing around your head at night."
1,Worthless as a Bug Catcher and Bulbs didn't last,"The only good thing I can say about this unit is that, it was inexpensive, when compared to other devices.After only, about a month and a half, the bulbs went out!The fan is very loud! While it lasted, this device did not catch one bug (and there were many around within that time)!The Dyna Trap catches bugs. Sunbeam lantern zappers worked (for the short time they lasted but the company no longer sells them). This device has been useless.M Calcagno"
3,If you just have a problem with mosquitoes at night ...,"... try hanging mosquito netting over your bedroom door. It's a lot more foolproof than electric devices. Mosquitoes are attracted by warmth, moisture, and carbon dioxide, all of which you produce while sleeping. They're probably not getting in through your bedroom windows, unless you have holes in your screens. Coleman makes a mosquito net available here on Amazon for about $15. I attached the short end to the top of the bedroom door molding with three pushpins. Yes, you have to move the netting aside if you get up during the night, but it's a small price to pay for not having the mosquitoes wake you up with their buzzing."
1,Terrible quality,"I bought one of these last summer. It caught maybe a dozen or so bugs the entire season.I went to turn it on this spring and the bulb started flickering, then went out. I thought it was the bulb and ordered a replacement, but it doesn't work either. The fan runs, but the bulb won't light.I had the exact same problem with a Stinger outdoor bug zapper; it quit working after just a single season."
3,Doesn't work for mosquitos,This is great for most flying insects. The only thing that it doesn't attract is mosquitos. If it was sold as a fly trap I would give it four or five stars.
1,NOT working,tried several nights in living room or kitchen where we have got mosquito bites. It has only caught 1 fruit fly and that's it (and this proves that we have used it right). The noise from the fan is also kind of annoying. This must be returned.
3,"So far, little effect.","This item is so far not very effective, but I haven't use it a lot yet. We had one night when there were at least a couple of mosquitos in the house and I had it run all night - it did catch nothing. To be honest, I haven't put it on 3ft height as the manual recommends (I had it on the floor), and I also have a permanent cabinet lighting in the open kitchen which - according to the manual - could interfere with the efficiency. They said, it should be pitch dark when using it, only the light of the trap should be visible.Also, the fan is relatively noisy. So you would not like to use it in your bedroom, for example.Anyway, I will give it another chance, but so far: not very effective."
1,Awfully quiet,"It seemed awfully quiet, until it became obvious that the fan wasn't working. Without the fan, bugs can enter and leave the trap. Even if the unit had worked, checking the trap is awkward, accidentally releasing live bugs is easy, and removing dead bugs is tricky. Didn't bother to return the unit, just wrote it off as a bad purchasing decision. No way to know if the dead fan is a common fault, but this unit will be going staight into the trash."
4,Good indoor bug collector,"This is the second bug trap we have, our first one broke after 4 years, which was used heavily by us.Attracts all kinds of flying pests, it works really nice."
1,Don't waste your money. It is a junk.,"I returned it. It is not working at all. Don't waste your money. Actually, I should give it no star."
1,not worth a damn,"I have a cocktail lounge and have a bad infestation of fruit flies, I have used this unit about a month and I catch at most 4 or 5 flies a day."
2,Catches No Squitos!,"During the times I ran this machine, I caught no mosquitos. I didn't like how loud it was so I placed it outside my bedroom door. Within a few times of using the machine, the flourescent bulb blew out. I read that the bulb blows out fast, but I can't believe that it blew out this fast. This is a very bright bulb that is very uncomfortable to the eyes at night when trying to sleep. Plus, it gives off a smell that I did not like. Can anyone recommend something that really does work for inside the house!?"
4,OK for me,"This device works fine but will not work miracles. I previously used a regular electronic stinger indoors but worried about the fire hazard. Bugs come near this and many miss but if you leave it on all night in a dark room, it eventually gets most."
1,Not worth it,The only thing I would suggest this is for a customer who has an intense fly problem. If you have very few flies that get in the house throughout the day just get a fly swatter. This product wont work for just a few flies nor will it work unless its dark. The light will only attract flies at night and never during the eay unless you live in a cave.
4,Works great for fruit flies,"We have a small fruit fly problem in our house, so I picked one of these up, not sure what to expect since the reviews seem to be so love-it-or-hate-it here. Thankfully, the trap is performing wonderfully for our purposes, and after the first two days there were over 20 flies caught. I think that this device would work very well for any very small insects like fruit flies, mosquitoes, and maybe gnats or anything else that would be unable to fly against the built-in fan's air suction, but it probably would not be very effective against larger insects."
2,Nosquito-then and now,"My first Nosquito trap ran, steadily, for at least 8 years, in an enclosed patio. I did use the replacement bulb, which came with it, and the whole unit died, right after the bulb was installed.My second unit was purchased in 2011, and lasted just a few months, before the fan died.I'm getting another unit, only because there's nothing else, out there, for anywhere near the price.I'll let you know how that goes;)."
1,Horrible product,We set this up on the counter after purchasing it from a hardware store. The next day I was eager to see how many bugs were trapped. The answer...ZERO! The next evening I literally watched bugs fly by with no hesitation. Not sure what's wrong with the product or perhaps I plugged it in wrong. Either way I wouldn't recommend this product.
4,"It works, when used correctly.","I'm not gunna lie, there are mosquito's in the trap. Which means it works! A lot of the other reviews talked about it not doing anything when outside, or having trouble pulling the trap out and putting it back in. First of all, this is an indoor unit. I put it in my one bedroom and den apartment, in the corner, turned it on, left for work, and there was a dead mosquito in the trap. Kept it on overnight, woke up, another dead mosquito in the trap. I've caught about a mosquito or two a day for the last couple days. So it does work!The trap is not hard to take out or put in. You just need to pull it straight out and put it back in straight. I really did not find a problem with it. Now if only it would catch the mosquito's more quickly, I could wake up one morning without a new bite!"
1,A waste of money,I bought this thinking it would be an indoor bug zapper. What it is a light with a fan that's suppose to draw the bugs in with the light into a compartment they can't get out of. It does not work!
1,A pure waste of money,"I have read bad reviews by other people, but decided to give it a try anyway. Well, I am sorry for my poor decision, because I am now convinced that this is a pure waste of my money. It catches nothing. I wonder if some bugs do ever get trapped, perhaps the house is so badly infested, and they simply got trapped by chances. I was tring to give it a rating with no star at all, but I was forced to make at least one star. Really, it does not even deserve one single star."
1,Didn't work for us,"Unfortunately, this product did not alleviate our mosquito problem. We have had it turned on for days and have only caught one mosquito. Many more are flying around mocking us with glee. Also, the problem with this machine is that it is very loud and exceptionally bright. You can't have it in your room at night because it's like having a huge fluorescent light on. Bummer."
1,Do the mosquito knot this is a trap?,Living by a creek...lots of mosquitos. Purchased 3 units. Within 1.5 months I counted 1 musquito traped within the 3 units! I have dumped all 3 units to the garbage. I was expecting from Honeywell not to put such a garbage on the market. May be I am wrong in case the machine indeed trapsthe mosquitos and immediatelly makes them invisible...or may be the mosquitos in Florida are really clever and the machine is made for Alabama mosquitos only.P.S beside the infernal machine makes an anoying noise during the night. If you want to get rid of your mother-in-law I do recommend to buy one and put it in her room.
1,Useless at catching mosquitoes,Have used it over 6 months with and without octenol. Have found it to be completely ineffective at catching even a single mosquito in the house.
4,Better than the reviews,"We and our neighbors were fighting this horrible fruit fly infestation. Put this on the kitchen counter and it's really made a difference. It's not perfect. It doesn't catch everything. But it's better than fly strips and those bug zappers. It also catches any stray mosquitoes in the house. I'd definitely recommend.PS. Some of those other reviews ... I don't know what they were expecting, a miracle? :)"
4,works well - a bit noisy for me,"I purchased the unit for inside my house at night because with recent rains many tiny mosquitoes seemed to infiltrate house. Yes, we have good screens and windows, and no, we do not leave the door open, but mosquitoes find their way in when anyone enters. Outside deterrents helped, but if even one comes in, there is a problem!This is not a cure-all, but it does help. Due to the light and fan noise I keep it in another room at night, but it does attract and trap the occasional mosquito. Definitely worth the price for me, and no breathing in more poisons!"
1,Waste of Money,"This is a weak machine, should I actually say ""junk""? I have it for three months now, and the only thing it has caught so far was one fly. It makes so much noise due to the built-in fan, apparently this feature is so poorly designed to trap any mosquitoes. This is a cute but useless machine. I decided to put this machine aside last night... Don't buy this machine because it does not work."
1,Just not effective on all bugs,"I am not going to type a long review why this is bad but get something else. Here are some points,1. yes it works the bugs fly into it. So the uv attracts them fine.2. Trouble is only catches some bugs little nats there is not enought wind for, the big house bugs are strong enought once sucked in to fly out, In fact I usally see them sitting onthe bulb then they just fly away.It might work on misquitos ok but I have other bugs I want to zap. This is to noisy and jsut doesn't work on all bugs. I woudl get the real bug zapper and avoid the fan noise and that will kill almost every bug."
3,stinger,it does what it says...the 2 negative things i've got to say about is that there's a not pleasant smell coming from the device and also is kinda loud because of the fan inside
5,Great idea for catching fruit flies,"For years I have been plagued with tiny fruit flies that somehow sneaked in to my house. I have been told they sneak in fruit you buy at the supermarket, or fly in the foor when you walk in. I bought this on a whim, and decided to give it a try. The fan is a little loud(not really that bad, sounds kind of like a humidifier), so I sat it in my kitchen on top of the fridge. After just ONE DAY I caught five fruit flies, a wasp(didn't know I had that), and a stink bug. It also acts a a nice nite light in my kitchen when I raid the refigerator at 3:00 AM. For me its a definite keeper."
2,Mosquitoes are still in the house.,"After reading most of the reviews of this product I decided to buy it cause I have an 8th months baby girl and mosquitoes is a real problem in my house. And yes, it still is a problem. The stinger doesn't work as the reviews tell, at least for me. And it cost me a lot more cause PR shipping is charged as international shipping nevertheless we use the same US Postal Ssetvice."
1,Useless,Doesn't matter how many reviewer claim how good this is. I've had serveral mosquito inside the house and i'd left the machine on 24x7 but it cought NONE what so ever. Totally useless!!!
1,doesn't work on indoor plant gnats,I bought this to get rid of the indoor plant gnats. It doesn't work for this type of insect. I am not sure if it will work at all. It attracts the bugs with the light and traps it. I prefer the machine that zaps these bugs. I'll see in the summer time if it could get rid of the mosquitos. I'll make another review later.
3,guess it works,"Texas, nuff said, but i really didn't see the skeeters like before. it is rather loud but worth the constant motor hum but I'll take the motor over the mosquito"
1,No good. Waste of money,Had this in my office for since September. I work in the country with lots of flies. I don't think it has killed one bug. Bummer.
1,pretty much worthless,"The fan is loud, and very weak. There is an opening at the base of the unit where flying insects can get ""sucked"" in by the fan, however it is too weak and inefficient to grab them unless they are about an inch away from the opening. This opening is closed mechanically when the switch is turned into the off position, and the trap can be removed from the unit. Most house flys and gnats in my house were only slightly interested in the glow emitted by the unit, gnats would land on the outside of the unit, or the wall next to it, but almost none would actually go inside of it. My vacuum cleaner was 1000 times more effective at taking care of a gnat infestation on my window screens. Solitary mosquitoes and house flys were not interested in the light, and were never trapped. Disappointing."
5,Winning,"I've had this product for a week now and so far it has caught 1 fly, and 1 mosquito. This may seem like a low number to you, but I assure you, one fly can ruin an entire weekend. Especially the extra friendly ones that land on your face in the middle of night. I usually end up going to bed raging when a fly is in the house, so this keeps my anger at bay. 1 mosquito....totally worth it. There are no words that can accurately convey the depth and totality of my hatred for mosquitoes. The mention of the word mosquito always causes me to itch. Knowing they're being slowly dried out like a piece of beef jerky does gives me a warm feeling in my heart. Ok enough. I don't live in the swamp, and the mosquito problem is minimal where I live, but I do absolutely hate them, and to catch one is a winner in my book. The blue glow of the fluorescent lamp gives me peace of mind. All this for under $30 I can't complain a bit."
2,Mosquito Trap,"This is only a moderately effective mosquito trap. It doesn't really attract them. It is the body scent that attracts them, and if they get too close to the fan, then they are sucked in, but I never noticed any of them being drawn to the light. I have had it continuously running for about six weeks (in Florida, we have year-round mosquito problems), and the few mosquitoes its trapped is negligible. It has attracted a few other bugs, but those aren't the ones I'm interested in killing."
4,"Surprisingly, it works!","I purchased this for my boyfriend because his apartment has a weird infestation of mosquitoes, causing him to get bit numerous times in the middle of the night. He and I were both skeptical at first, but after using it for about 2+ months, it's caught quite a few insects and prevented a bunch of irritating bites! It's even caught moths, gnats, and regular flies, so it's doing more than hoped. The only thing I'd have to say is a negative, is that the light is extremely bright. If you can get yourself used to a bright blue light glowing over the soft hum of the fan while you sleep, then this product could work wonders. However, if you're a light sleeper or have trouble sleeping with a light in the room, this may not help so much. All in all, though, this product is pretty amazing."
1,No clue how these continue to sell,"We have had a bad mosquito season this year. I have purchased a couple units to try to combat this and this is the latest and certainly greatest engineering blunder. I gave it a month's use. It failed to catch one mosquito. It did manage, however, to attract more mosquitoes indoors with the extremely bright light - they just came to feast and not to rest in the little trap. The problem got so bad that I ended up getting bitten to the point I contracted W. Niles. I squarely blame this unit for 5 weeks of hell.If you buy this, you are making a mistake much greater than the wasted cost of the unit. I am aghast at the danger this mosquito attraction device subjected me and my family to. I can only assume all the positive reviews are affiliated with Stinger - I'm flabbergasted a device that exacerbates the problem it is meant to solve can stay on the market."
4,It DOES work,"We live in Savannah and just had a Hitchcock-like attack of mosquitoes this spring. Inside. I bought the indoor/outdoor combo set and have mainly used this indoor one so far, having had the set for about 2-3 weeks. I just checked the trap area and there were dozens of dead mosquitoes in there. No other bugs just mosquitoes. So there you have it. I was worried when I read bad reviews but seeing those dead bugs makes me feel so good!"
5,Love this,"We live in bug central Florida, and I got this to kill mosquitoes.....it works great. I am not sure what some other reviewers were talking about it will not open if the power goes it does not open. I love it, ran 4 times.....40 dead bugs. You do have to turn off all the lights so that it works.But I love it!!!"
3,"Catches flies, but they can escape!","I bought this in a combo kit at Costco--this indoor trap and an outdoor bug zapper. I put this unit in my garage in complete darkness and within 30 seconds all the flies flew over to the trap. The fan isn't quite strong enough to really suck them in unless they fly around inside the unit. I was also surprised to see that the flies definitely could esape from the trap if they continued to fly around within the trap.They are supposed to die of dehydration within the trap--I'm wondering how long that will take for flies...Pros: Light definitely attracts flies, moths, and smaller flying insects.Cons: Flies seem to be able to escape from the trap and since it does not kill them right away, this sort of defeats the purpose. Fan needs to be stronger for the average house fly to really get sucked into the trap.I'm going to try putting the trap in the freezer as one person did to see how many flies actually stayed inside the trap."
1,Review.,"The Stinger Insect Mosquito Indoor Trap did not work properly.The light would come on but the blower was not.I have not been able to use the product so far, and I am not a happy camper."
1,BEWARE - reviews look fishy!!,"June 21 2007, May 15, 2007, June 7 2007 --- suddenly a spurt of REVIEWS ALL GIVING 5 stars, NONE having ANY other reviews but this and all other reviewers (earlier dates) giving BAD stars and 1 of them actually having multiple reviews AND giving 1 star.... well, definitely looks very, very fishy reviews here. I say .. we need to be careful about this one. Also, I checked the Manufacturer's website, NOWHERE do they mention INDOOR usage or INDOOR generic locations, which I gather effectively means (a) Not meant for indoor use (b) Fan is loud (c) Lamps are bright. Seriously, if meant for indoor use, definitely it would have been highlighted. I don't think I'll waste my money buying it, considering the ""fishiness"" of reviews here."
2,Slightly entertaining,"The stories were a mix of ""ok"" and ""terrible"".The narrators were all pretty good though.The packaging is really bad and flimsy."
2,Caveat Emptor!,"Be aware! This audio edition is a truncated version of the original book -- it contains only eight of the original stories. When it states ""Unabridged,"" that means that the eight stories, less than half the printed book, are ""unabridged."" Some of the best tales from the print version of STALKERS -- by F. Paul Wilson and Al Sarrantonio, for instance -- are missing. Also, the readings are all over the place in terms of quality, and there are no story reference points printed on the cds themselves -- you have to search through the discs to find the story you want. In short -- this is not STALKERS the way it was originally published."
5,ANOTHER JOHNNY CASH GOT TO HAVE !!!!!,"THIS DVD IS ANOTHER JOHNNY CASH GOTTA HAVE !!LIVE IN DENMARK IS REALLY A GREAT INVESTMENT FOR TRUE CASH FANS. RECORDED LIVE , WITH JUNE CARTER CASH, YOUNG STATLER BROS, CARL PERKINS, AND MOTHER MAYBELLE AND THE CARTER SISTERS, THIS IS YET ANOTHER TREASURE!!YOU CAN FEEL THE LOVE JOHN AND JUNE HAD FOR ONE ANOTHER. TEARS WILL FLOW WHEN YOU HERE THE CARTER SISTERS ALONG WITH JOHNNY SINGING THEIR TRIBUTE SONG TO MOTHER MAYBELLE..WHAT A BLESSING TO HAVE ALL THE CASH MUSIC WE CAN STILL ENJOY .. THANKS JOHN AND SISTERS FOR SHARING THESE !!"
4,Great Quality DVD from 1971,"This DVD is great in video and audio quality. Johnny is at his best vocally and it's very interesting to see June, Carl Perkins, The Statler Brothers, and the Carter Family at this time in their lives. The concert appears to be more of a TV studio setting, wished it could have been at a regular arena setting. I saw Johnny live in Spokane, Wa. in 1971 and this is the Johnny that I remember, very intertaining."
4,Johnny Cash Live in Denmark,"I liked the fact that this DVD not only included Johnny, but Carl Perkins, June Carter Cash, the Stadler Brothers, and the Carter Family. It showed how Johnny ""walked the line"" between Rock and Roll and Country Music."
1,Johnny Cash: Man In Black - Live In Denmark 1971,"I was VERY unhappy with this so called DVD.....I could not watch it on my TV....we had to view it through the computer. It was not enjoyable to watch it that way. I believe that it should not have been advertised as a DVD, when it was not view able through a conventional DVD player."
1,Without merit,"Uninspired performance with a wierd Danish crowd, in antiseptic studio setting that is distracting to view."
4,Excellent reference of the US Intelligence community.,"Richelson does an excellent job of providing a link and detail to all of the U.S. intelligence successes and failures over the last 35 years. This is a superb reference book for the young and old intelligence officer in a Joint or Interagency environment that needs to know how the intelligence system in the United States works. Richelson does not write in theory. All of this book is practical, useful and hard-hitting. It will give you excellent depth and insight into those often heard but little known intelligence successes and debacles. From the USS Pueblo to the origin and current status of satellite intelligence, this book covers it all."
3,useful but dry,"Richelson does his homework and provides a volume about the structure of the intelligence community either citing current data, or the most recently released declassified data concerning currently classified programs. Ultimately the book is a reference, not a read. He offers only a few pages of analysis on his work, so there is no new perspective on hot topics concerning the structure or function of the IC. That being said, there are not a lot of other books out there about the USIC, so you may have to go with this one if you want to know anything."
1,The US Intelligence Community: Third Edition,"I have read each edition of this fascinating book as it has been published. Sadly, each has served as a historical reference only. For those not well versed in this field this provides a detailed overview of the community. Mr. Richelson's latest Edition (number 5) is far more interesting and draws you in while still providing in depth knowledge."
2,dry,"book is very dry, but had to buy for masters course. Would not have had any interest in reading for my own pleasure."
3,More of a tribute than a biography,"While there are some interesting tidbits in this book, it can in no way be called an objective biography. The authors developed a close relationship with the subject and it shows. Some insight would have be interesting in the area of her alcohol use, her feelings about Diana's choice of Muslim men, Charles Spencer's womanizing, her religious conversion and her ultimate isolation from society at large. The book is instead a compilation of her philosophies about life and childrearing. With her youngest two children (Diana and Charles) clearly so badly damaged by their parents divorce, it would have been interesting to get her views on her responsibility for the end product. There is none of this. In the end, it is the last photo of Mrs. Shand Kydd in the book that says much more than the book does. Alone on her island looking sad, old and careworn."
3,HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW,"AN UNTHYMELY DEATH is Wittig Albert's ""break"" from her regular China Bayles series. This is a collection of short stories that have more recipes and herboidal facts than real honed plots. Fans of the series will enjoy the little ""mysteries"" which range from robbery to murder, but they're not intricately plotted. Albert is wise in that regard; how many murders can a little town little Pecan Creek have? Most of the stories focus on China and Ruby with only one having McQuaid involved. For fans only."
5,Great addition for China fans!,"I've been a huge fan of the China Bayles series since I picked up the first book at the library a couple years ago. Since then, I'm such a bibliophile I've bought everyone for my own collection. I love Albert's mystery series, and this compendium is a nice supplement for it. The stories are short but the wealth of information on herb facts is not. I very much enjoyed it."
4,Exactly what I thought,Nice short stories. I have read her China Bayles stories and as stories go they are vastly more involved. However to take a break and read a short entertaining story before going back to housework without finding your whole day shot by getting caught up in a full novel it was great. I also tried some of the herbal crafts that were in the stories and liked them.
1,Disappointing,"This is a collection of short stories with herbalist China Bayles andcrew as protagonists. While the China Bayles series of mysteries is oneof my favorites, I didn't care for this book at all. The stories weretoo short, there was no time to develop a mystery at all, the solutionswere abrupt, and the entire volume was chopped up with sidebars onnearly every page with little known facts and folklore about whateverherbs were mentioned on that page, and recipes for each and every fooddish mentioned in the stories. Many of these took up an entire page andall of them, without fail, served to distract me from the story at hand.Horrible format, IMO. What a waste of time! I finished it, so I'llgive it a 1, but Ms. Albert is capable of so much better than this, I'membarrassed for her."
3,"Goodbye energy, goodbye soul","As one of the many people who had the honor of seeing RATM perform in their prime, I can tell you right now that this isn't anywhere close to what they used to be capable of.I bought the CD because ... well, I had to. It's Rage. But it sucks.I'm a big fan, too, so that's hard for me to come out and say, but hey, you can't ignore the facts. The problem with this album is that it's clear their hearts are no longer in it. This isn't a bang; it's a whimper.I can go into a track-by-track analysis, but I'm not going to waste your time.If you're looking for Rage in their prime, with all the energy and nerve they once posessed, check out the bootleg live album. If you're just a fan, pick this up I guess, but there's really nothing new on it."
2,Nearly unwatchable.,"There has been some discussions about how this dvd really captures a live RATM show. I think those opinons couldn't be farther from the truth. The video is so extremely over-edited that I find it impossible to watch. The sound quality and performance (i think) are good, but overall this does not capture the essence of a show simply because of it's dizzying camera work and quick edits."
3,RATM - okay but not great,"My 15 year old was somewhat disappointed about this DVD. Somehow she expected it to be more ""dynamic"" and to give more a feel of being there at the concert (a tall order for sure). Since the DVD didn't do this, she's giving it an average rating."
4,"Good sound, video quality",They've done a good job of capturing the spirit of this last concert. The sound quality is very good and the video clarity is also very good. The stage is relatively plain with no revolving set pieces and the camera work tries to be too flashy at times. Excellent set list and reproduction of the albums.
2,Weak,"I love RATM, but due to the combination of the production, and the performance, this DVD is the weakest thing Rage has ever put out, buy their other DVDS, or better yet get their cd's. I wish I could get a refund, it's not worth the 13$ I paid for."
4,Magnificent!,"Every RATM funs must have this DVD! I miss subtitles in this DVD ,otherwise its is great. What a shame that RATM dose not exict anymore!"
5,Supreme!,"The most intelligent and inspiring band of the 1990s. And their high octain live act makes Korn and co. look like an episode of the ""Love boat."""
3,"Like it, but made for smaller face & a ittle dorky.","Not my favorite or my least liked one. This ended up being my spared glasses to wear while I am doing procedures to avoid fluids spurting into my eyes.Not a great quality, but worth the price. Glass clarity is good. there is some fogging, though."
2,not worth the money,"First, remove the word ""mystery"" from the title. I played this with my [...] daughter and we completed the entire game in 90 minutes. The clues are more like facts that Barbie shares rather than things the player finds. There is little reasoning or thought required by the player, and there is no way to deduce the culprit without hearing the culprit's backstory at the end of the game. Maybe suitable for 6 - 8 year old."
4,good game for very yong kids,"This game is great for young kids. My 6-year old loves this game (after I helped her get through it the first time.) The graphics are a little fake looking (I am surprised at Activision's lack of finesse in this area). However, I must say again the game is fun and at times challenging enough to want to play it multiple times."
2,Too easy!,My 12 year old and 8 year old daughters loved this game. They've both played it twice in one day and really had fun. My complaint is that I spent $30 on it and it took them each about an hour to play the whole game. It's not worth the money.
4,High School fun,This is a good game for young teens that are starting high school. It would be fun to play with an updated version with today's graphics!
1,Beach Wrestling,"This is a movie about wrestling on the beach. It is a really lame movie. I rented it thinking it would be a good WWF movie, but it wasn't. Oh well. Just don't rent it or buy it."
4,Almost perfect,"Tested and proven level. However, I wish the long edges were flat aluminum instead on painted and rounded. I purchased this as a dual purpose level/straight edge, but the edge is rounded and painted. Therefore, you don't that sharp line that you'd expect. Otherwise, great."
5,Essential Euro-crime,"Bang for your buck....3 out of 4 films in this set, I just love. If you are new to 1970s Italian crime films, this is the place to start. If you like the genre, you've already bought this set. The Boss, The Italian Connection and Caliber 9 are all fantastic films in their own unique ways. The picture quality on the blu-rays are good considering the age, but not great."
2,boss dvd is defective,I got this set today.The dvd of the boss freezes several times around the one hour mark as another reviewer has said.Also their dvd of secret of dorian gray was also defective and was recalled.I hope in the future raro dvd will use more quality control.
4,"Great movies, great price, poor packaging","Movies are great, as good as they've ever looked. Packaging is very cheap - very thin plastic cases. Two of four DVDs came loose during shipping and were scratched. Didn't affect their play, but I expect better."
4,"Problems with ""The Boss"".","I""ve had problems with three copies of ""The Boss"" freezing between 1:00 and 1:05 mark. The special feature documentary ""Storie di mafia"" has about a 30 second delay between the audio and the picture on all three copies. The rest of the discs play flawlessly."
3,does what it does,"It protects your impact, nothing else. does it job.Hard to install. My IR looks better too..recommend if you work in shop"
5,Adorable and tasty too,"I put these into a flower pot for my daughter's First Birthday favor. They were adorable, and a big hit! They also tasted just as good as they looked!"
3,Excellent Cookies -- Not good when expired,"I live in Bellingham WA where these cookies are made, and I absolutly love them. I eat one for breakfast, and one for that mid-afternoon snack to keep me away from the office chocolate jar. What I don't like are the near-expired cookies Amazon keeps sending me. These near-expired cookies are hard and crumbly, nothing like the soft and chewy cookies I love. So I'd rate the cookies a 5+, but the expired cookies from Amazon a 0."
4,My kids love 'em!,"I was cautiously optimistic about ordering these and was not disappointed; they're really yummy! They do have just a bit of a fruity taste, so if you're looking for Mrs. Fields' standard of flavor, keep looking. But, unlike a dessert cookie, these are nutritious. I think the slight trade-off of flavor for nutrition is well worth it. My 4 kids love them and each wanted to buy his or her own bag so they wouldn't have to share! The cookies are somewhat large and very filling; we all have trouble finishing a whole one and feel satisfied for quite awhile afterward."
4,An Acceptable Meal Replacement,"For flavor, I could give these cookies a ""5"", but the health aspects demand that they only rate a ""4"". All told, they taste great and are the best on the go lunch I have found for hubby (he often eats on the run). The price is right and it keeps him from cruising though the nearest drive though."
2,"beware of ""stale"" cookies...",I purchased 2 types of these cookies recently (chocolate chunk and lemon poppy seed) and both arrived promptly however were PAST their purchase buy date! Amazon resolved the situation but be certain you check your product when you receive it. I had purchased the fruit and nut type in the past and thery were excellent.
3,Where's the chocolate taste?,"I thought this would be a great breakfast-on-the-go for the kids, but if they won't eat it, it's useless. They won't eat these."
2,Not very good to me...,"The chocolate in this is bitter tasting, not sweet. I can't get excited about eating them, so I am giving them to my kids. They taste too healthy to me."
4,4 star breakfast cookie,"This is my favorite quick breakfast because of it's healthy ingredients and high fiber and taste.But, make sure to eat them quickly or refrigerate right away. After two days of room temp in the cupboard, my cookies got moldy. SO, freeze or refrigerate."
5,Fills you up all morning!,"These things are great...I love Baker's Breakfast cookies. This flavor is pretty darn good, too, big chunks of chocolate and lots of flavor. Doesn't taste fake at all. I prefer a couple other flavors more, but this is definately a winner. These cookies taste like a treat but are really healthy for you. They will fill you up for hours, especially with a glass of water, juice or milk to wash it down!"
2,Received almost expired cookies,"Despite reading complaints about expiration dates I ordered these cookies from Amazon because I cannot find them near my home and the shipping direct from the manufacturer is high. Well, I should have listened -- I received my cookies today - they expire tomorrow. They're good cookies if fresh."
2,kind of dry,"Unfortunately, I did not like these very much. They are really dry. I really like the idea of a breakfast cookie. It would make a great on the go snack, or light breakfast. If you can get past the texture, they do not taste bad."
4,"Charming contemporary romance, Southern style","The unusual courtship and marriage of a young man struggling to achieve his dreams and an independant, wealthy young woman who wrestles with her love for him and her father's disapproval and attempts to control her life. Very well written, and gets the flavor of small town Southern society just right"
2,"Great idea with ""memory foam"", needs to be wider!!","I have a tall and thin little girl who just turned 3 years old. This seat looked great with the features, extra holders for ""stuff"" and the one we purchased had ""memory foam"". We purchased two of these following a car accident as one for the fixed car and one for my car (her primary car) since my son is old enough to need her Cosco Alpha Omega. I had great hopes of this being a fairly inexpensive car seat (compared to the Britax that my ex-EMT neighbor begged me to get). This seat is SO NARROW!!!!!! My daughter's shoulders look squeezed in. She loves it because of the extra head rest/pillow, and of all things the neck roll for when she falls asleep, but I hate it. I returned one of the two, and am getting something different for her primary car seat. This is ok for a spare in my husband's car, but I can't think of how uncomfortable she must be every day."
2,"Nice, but it creates too much frustration for us","We bought this seat for our second vehicle, so we didn't have to swap the original car seat back and forth. We had this seat for several weeks and have now returned it. It became too frustrating and I never felt that my daughter was truly safe in it.The belts were next to impossible to really tighten - the seat was always sliding a little. Also, the straps were always getting twisted.We have several Graco products and I love them all. I think that Graco products are very well made, durable, and safe. However, I think that this particular model of car/booster seat needs to go back to the designers and engineers for serious improvments.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Happy for a year,"I have owned this car set for a little over a year. Overall I have been extremely happy with it. My daughter was almost 1 when it was purchased. It was originally purchased for my son (who is little for his age) who was 3 1/2 at the time however, the belt in the crotch area was too close to his and was uncomfortable. So, it was then used for my daugther. She loved it, had no complaints and looked very comfortable in it. Now she is 2 and only weighs 24 lbs. She now complains that her back hurts and will not get in her seat. I can feel the area she is referring to. It is where the foam ends and her upper back rests against the seat. I don't know if this is common thing, if her back is too boney, or if she is just being 2. She does sit in her older carseat just fine with no complaints though. I am very sad because this car seat seemed perfect, fit in the car very well, easy to clean and the side pockets worked out well."
4,How Does the Snooze Bar Work?,"I recently purchased this seat for my two year old and so far I have been pleased with it. I only have a couple of issues...1 the seat seams really narrow...too narrow to hold a 100lb. child, as it says it will...(for now that it is not an issue and my child is very comfortable and happy in it but I just don't know how it will last that long.) Also, my car has LATCH, and the car seat instructions weren't really that clear on how to install with LATCH. I realize all vehicles are different, but the car seat manual was no help with this...also does anyone have any idea how the snooze bar feature works? I can't seem to figure it out and there is NOTHING about it in the manual....Overall, this seat is a good seat and I have had GRACO products in the past that I have been extremely pleased with. I would probably purchase it again...I just wish the instructions were a little more clear. If anyone could offer help, I would appreciate it. Thanks. :)"
4,Best Buy,"This is a very good Booster seat for growing kids. I agree that the cup holders are lousy but NO big deal ! For so much comfort, you can forsake cupholders - cant' you ? Great padding, sturdy and easy to install. My son loves it and so do I. Fits-in and looks great in any size car - sedan or suv. I would definitly recommend this seat."
4,"Great Car Seat, but very hard to tighten!!","I am really happy with this car seat and my 2 year old loves it as well!! I bought this car seat in store. I went in with another car seat in mind, but after talking to the sales man, who is a car seat inspector, he recommended this car seat to me. He said that this car seat is the only car seat that he recommends buying (at least the ones in store) that were a car seat/booster combo. This one was the only one that had the EPS (the stuff found in bike helmets). He said that it could be life saving in a side inpact accident.The only problem that I have with this car seat is that it is very hard to tighten. I pull the strap with all of my might and it feels like it is not going anywhere. It takes a while for me to tighten the straps everytime he gets in the car seat.If the straps were easier to tighten, then I would give it 5 stars!"
3,I like the look and padding in the seat.,I also had a problem getting the straps to tighten. I pulled as hard as I could (my husband tried too.) I even tried having my child lean forward and nothing worked. I removed the seat from my car and had no problems getting the straps to tighten. I have a 2002 Ford Explorer and think the car seat just didn't work with my seat angles. I didn't like that I could see the foam starting to come up through the holes where the straps come out after only having it for two weeks. I seemed to struggle with twisting straps too. Even with these minor irritations I would have kept the seat if I could have gotten the straps to tighten.
2,difficult,"Positives1. Well padded2. Fit well in my car with the seatbelt. (2000 intrepid RT)Negatives1. my 33 pound 38 inch tall child looks smushed when i put him in the car seat. Add a winter jacket, he could barely sit back.2. When child sits in seat it is IMPOSSIBLE to tighten straps. This is due to the fact that there is no backing on the carseat and the weight of the child pushes the straps into the back og the seat creating too much friction.3. Very difficult latch installation.4. Cup holders are lousy!"
2,Poor quality,"I have always been pleased with Graco products, but this car seat is terrible! We bought it two weeks ago and already:-the straps twist VERY easily-the straps are uneven (one side is much looser than the other)-the adjustment panel popped off and now the button won't workMy three-year-old loves the seat and says it is comfortable (despite how it seems too narrow for him and he is small) and I love the cupholder and mesh bag attachments...BUT it's going back to the store ASAP!!"
2,Not a safe car seat !!!!,"I bought this car seat based on other review saying that is was great, ITS NOT. It slips forward and side to side. My husband is a highway patrol officer and has been trained on how to install car seats and he can't get it completley secure in either vehicle. We own 3 Britax car seats and this was our first purchase outside of Britax and I regret it. The seat belt on this vehicle also is one piece, which means that it gets lopsided and you have to pull on one side to try to get the top even. I will spend the money on Britax from now on. When you try to move a Britax after it's installed your vehicle will shake rather than the car seat. Nothing compares."
2,"Too Narrow, Skimpy Shoulder Straps that Twist","I tried this car seat a few times and found the straps very thin and narrow (of the 5-point Harness System, weak and flimsy. It tended to twist and get caught. I also did not think the seat was wide enough.My wife got frustrated and made me take it back. I tought the Britax Marathon and Britax Roundabout that we puchased had more padding and a better operating harness. The Graco was thin and is about what you would expect for the difference in price.Although the Britax products are much larger, there is no comparison product that works as smoothly on the Market. We have now gone through 5 car seats and the Britax Products are the best. My advice- spend the extra money for the Britax.Rob"
2,"Once you have a Britax, nothing else will do","We needed to moved our 3 year old from his Britax Roundabout to a convertible/booster. I liked the cushy padding and, of course, my son loved the cup holder. It seemed like a nice seat. I, like others, had issues with being able to tighten the straps properly. My car doesn't have LATCH, and I also found it difficult to get the seat secure enough. (Why doesn't this seat have a tether?) Even the moment I took it out of the box, I didn't feel it was as solid as the Britax. After having the seat in my car for a couple of months - and standing out in the cold Chicago weather for ten minutes each outing trying to get the straps tightened - I ordered the Britax Husky. Love it. We'll keep the CarGo for an extra."
1,my child ate memory foam,"I loved the carseat for about a month. That is when my 2 year old daughter found that she could pick at the memory foam and eat it. Around the area where the lap belt would go through, if using seatbelt, the pad does not cover the memory foam. When a child sits in the seat the foam sticks out even more thus allowing the child to tear it to pieces."
2,"Great car seat, I hate it as a booster","I LOVED this one as a car seat, very secure. I have it about a year now and she has been using it without the harness and as a booster and I hate it. The belt straps arn't attached to the seat but the fabric which is only held to the seat with a few bands, I have NEVER, EVER, gotten more then a few blocks away before the belt comes out of the attachements because it's so flimsy that when she wiggles around or even just leans forward to look at something out the come. I thought it was just my child was to wiggle but after my friends child sat in my other one (I was stupid enough to buy 2 of these) the same thing happened to her son. I don't feel safe taking it on short trips, never mind the long ones. I wouldnt recommend it as a booster at all"
1,Too Compact,"This seat was bought to replace a Graco Comfort Sport. It was quickly returned once we sat our child in it. It was so narrow. She was scrunched in it. The buckle between the childs legs does not have a slot to move it out far enough, so basically she was sitting on the buckle piece. And when she sat in it you sit deep in the seat but the seat is elevated where the knees are. That had to somewhat be cutting off circulation. I couldn't imagine keeping her in that position for a two hour car ride. Cosco's line of booster seats are much more roomy. Everything other item of baby gear I own has been Graco (which I love) but this seat is just plain horrible. However, since it is so narrow it would be perfect for someone who has to put seats right next to each other..."
2,Don't plan to use as a booster,"As other reviewers have stated, this is not the best booster (seatbelt only), as the shoulder belt guides are flimsy and tend to catch when the child leans forward, leaving them loose (and unsafe).It's a decent regular seat, fairly comfy (although my daughter says the Britax Roundabout is better) and I like the cupholder and net. However, I hate the straps! They get twisted, and uneven, and require a lot of messing with that I'd prefer to avoid. Thankfully this is our secondary seat, not the one we use the most, or I think I would be tearing my hair out.We've used ours for about 2 years and the fabric is okay so far, but again it's not the main carseat for us. Perhaps the different choices of fabrics would make a difference in how they hold up, as well."
4,Mother of 4,"We have had this car seat for about 2 weeks and love it, I bought it for my 2 year old daughter. She had to move up from A britax, which we love, because my 6 month old had out grown his seat. She loves sitting in my older boys' booster seats but she is to small yet for them to fit her right. I have purchased many cars seats in the past, and have tried many booster seats and this one by far is the best I have found for a younger child. We dont have to worry about her head falling foward as with other seats.I do think they need to redo the cup holder idea, they fall of way to easy, but other than that we as parents love it and most important my 2 year old loves it. I would highly recomend this seat. For comfort and for price."
4,"5 stars with the harness, NO star with the seatbelt!","This seat worked great when we used it with the harness. Very comfy, fabric held up great and my daughter liked the little pillow it came with...sometimes...When I began using, or should I say when I used it for the first time with the seatbelt, I went right into the house and began researching other booster seats. The belt positioner is a joke. It was impossible sometimes to even get it in, (the 3 times I used it) and forget about trying to exlain to other people who are not familiar with car seats how to even get the belt in the positioner. It is all together a bad idea. I do love graco and I am surprised at the way this car seat worked out. Maybe manufacturer's should just stick to a seat having one age and function, b/c it seems to me that every type of convertible car seat ends up being bad in one of the areas. Good luck!"
1,Not what it seems,"I purchased this online almost 2 years ago and while it says it's a talking dictionary for english<>slovak, it only talks in English and not Slovak. Great if your a Slovak!!!! The company promised me that I would be the first to get the revised version that talks in both directions but a recent email to them in early 2008 told me it doesn't exist yet. However, they have a phrasebook that talks in both directions, which they gave me to calm me down. That was nice of them but if you are expecting to learn Slovak with this product, it's not going to help."
5,No Disappointment,"When i first started listening to reggae music many years ago, Don carlos was among the few artists i was familiar with. I loved his music so much that i've remained his fan to present . This Album is no exeption, his musical genius continues to flow through this album and you can't go wrong with this one."
5,A Laid Back Message,A thoroughly enjoyable performance. Easy listening with some thoughts to ponder.
3,good,"Product received on time on a good package for avoid damages, very good to restauration of my jeep CJ-5 1975"
2,"Did not work, returned","After trying to cook a thawed out steak of 1"" thickness on this grill for the first time, I gave up after 45 minutes! The steak was barely warm. I contacted the manufacturer who first wanted to send me another heating element. But this unit was also larger than I expected, so they agreed to let me return the unit. I had to wash it off and put it back in the box, but at least the manufacturer refunded my purchase price promptly, including the return shipping cost. So I gave 2 stars since the manufacturer was courteous about the return. Perhaps it was a bad heating element but I have never purchased an electric grill that did not work well."
4,The Satch Tapes,"A great insight to the man himself ""Joe Satriani"". One of the best guitarist of our era. enough said!!"
5,Must Have for All Guitar Fanatics,"This is a great video !!! It gives a detail on Joe Satriani's history, recoding process and also includes several music videos such as Summer Song, Satch Boogie, The Feeling, Big Bad Moon, I Believe, and Always With Me Always With You. This is a must have for all Satch fans !!! Its also at a great Price here at Amazon !"
4,Political Junkie Fun... Mostly,"I learned about this book through a third-party mailing list, and I did find it a lot of fun to read. Best of all was the extended Election Night sequence, written hour-by-hour as the returns came in. The author's story of a credible third party presidential candidacy is a page-turner, and brings up important questions about the perils of the Electoral College. However, Field spends far too much time promoting his own agenda, which is a sort of New Age progressivism, heavily reliant on alternative energy, vegetarianism, and drug legalization. No matter what one thinks of these views, a serious political analyst would know that they are anathema to most voters. The fact that the candidate's campaign is reborn when he announces he supports legalizing drugs is simply implausible. If you love close elections, read it for the campaign, and skip over the speeches. You won't be missing much."
2,not great,I didn't like this book because there wasn't a real plot and no real sentences - perhaps for 3-4 year olds but older than that I would say no.
3,Great CD for collection,I am glad i bought this item and it has provided a great entertainmnet for my family and friends alike.
2,From Italy With Love =>,"CD => ""POST CARD"" = > From Italy post card .... I can not here the CD WHY ?reards,Mr. Grotticelli"
2,The Keys of Shallow,"The Keys of Hell was very shallow when it came to charicter development. The action was good and the discriptions of events were good, but beyond that there was nothing. It seems like he's trying to just write another book like another essay for a high schooler, not putting any thought into it and just focusing on the basics. Higgins is capable of a lot better, as shown with the Flight of Eagles. Two stars for plot and discription of events, and nothing else."
2,Confusion,"The reason I titled this review ""Confusion"" was due to the fact that I am perplexed about how whenever I read a book from a new author, it is one of his lesser accomplishments. I know Jack Higgins is a great and successful author, but I am going to say I did not enjoy this book. It wasn't written poorly, but due to its paper-thin storyline, I wasn't impressed. The story is just a giant flashback. It begins with a group of Italians reviewing Paul Chavasse's file, and they are impressed by one of his missions. Higgins' then stretches this thin plot through 250 pages. Personally, I would've rather read the summary in Chavasse's file than have read ""The Keys of Hell."""
2,Good But Not Worth the Price,"The book starts off just like another book written by the author - only different names are used. The scenario, however is very much the same as one of Sean's novels. I like Higgins' books and have gone back and purchased every one in the Sean Dillon series. I felt cheated with this book when I noticed the Locations (pages?) only went to 2168 instead of >5000. It's more like the short stories that I pay 0.99 for. Anyway, it was a decent read if you don't have anything else to do but I felt like I was re-reading a book previously written for other characters."
4,Great Short story,"Jack has done it again, with a different hero. Higgins proves that no matter how pretty the rose is it still has thorns."
4,exciting and breath taking,"I think others should read this book, but only if you like war and drugs and things like that. This book is a real good book because of the way they use the language and images are almost real clear. It's about an undercover cop who try's to get rescue the sectaries daughter, from a drug lord who holds her for ransom. The worst aspect of this book is that it corresponds with drugs. Some times the book bounces around from the past to the present and just changes when ever."
4,well said,"Dr. Fee says what needs to be said about this awful and unbiblical teaching of ""health/wealth."" Could have been a bit more detailed, but he did a good job otherwise. I am sure not everyone would agree with his conclusions though."
3,Far to short to be useful,"Many members of my family are fully submersed in the Health and Wealth Gospels and I read this hoping to see lots of good information. It had some decent insights but was far too brief to get into any detail and its nothing more than a overview. I would like a book like this but only 5x the size and 5x the depth. Really for something this short, the essays would be better suited in a compilation book."
3,If you liked the first...READ THIS!,"At first, the book starts out confusing. It misses something important...oh yeah, the vibrant character of Danilo. However, after many chapters, you are engrossed in the new story and loving it. The ending...somewhat predictable but interesting!"
5,Zumba@51,I purchased this CD and I love it!! I am 51 and haqve been needing to get back in the flow of moving and excercising my body. It is low impact and really easy to learn the steps but u have to be at least a little coordinated to move with her!! Try it u will LOVE IT!!
2,too fast for beginners,"This is way too fast for me and hard to learn. It is definitely NOT for beginners. Because she is so physically fit, she must think that everyone can do her stuff. Not so! I am disappointed. :("
2,beginners means you need steps broken down,"okay i thought this would be great, im a beginner and i needed the exercise. but i was disappointed when i viewed the the video right away she just started movin and groovin and i was completly blown away. i didnt know how to do any of the moves, and i wasnt sure i was even doing it right once i was able to follow a step. im pretty sure that a beginner video should at least break down the steps, but now sorry she doesnt. if you want a great dance video go with bellydancing. at least all the instructors on there break down the steps before putting them together."
3,"good teacher, lousy music",I found Grimes easy to follow but the rhythm-machine music was uninspiring. I've only used it twice and am still looking for the perfect Zumba for between classes.
5,"Dance Fitness for Beginners, Madonna Grimes",Dance Fitness for Beginners with MaDonna Grimes: African Beat - Latin HeatI absolutely enjoy this dance workout. It is easy to follow and I still get a great workout. I'm glad I purchased this one. I read the reviews before my purchase which was a tremendous help to get exactly what I wanted. Exercise can be fun.
5,Lots of Fun,"Not being familiar with this DVD, I was hoping it wouldn't be a ""B"" DVD - -it's an A+. Fun and easy way to exercise while learning a new style of dance."
2,Boring and non-motivating,"Even though the moves are probably not quite for beginners, I found this workout very easy to follow. I thought MaDonna cued well enough. It's also relatively easy to make the moves higher impact. My problem with it is that I find it very boring and non-motivating. The music is blah, the routine no fun and Madonna's personality doesn't do anything for me. Another downside: this is a DVD from Natural Journeys, where you are forced to watch their advertisement every single time, because it won't let you fast-forward or skip ahead."
4,so so workout,"I would have given this DVD 5 stars but the workout was too quick, not long enough to work up a sweat which is what I was striving for. I normally workout on a treadmill and I thought this would be a great deviant but unfortunately for me it wasn't. I did like the workout steps, I had no problem with the routines."
2,False advertising,"Promoted on-line as Zumba record for exercise. This may be something, but it is not Zumba! Music is acceptable, just falsely identified, probably to take advantage of the Zumba rage of today."
1,Not For Real Dance Beginners,"I thought this would include instruction on how to do the dance moves as well as routines for exercise. When I played it, I couldn't keep up because I am a beginner. This DVD will be no help to me because I can't do it and get frustrated. Perhaps their definition of beginner is different then mine."
1,needs to give more instructions,"this DVD does not give you a breakdown of the moves, it is done too quickly and you struggle to keep up. Not like other DVD's that give good instructions and takes the time to show you the steps. No wonder it was so cheap, doubt if I use it again. If you are a quick learner then this would be a good cardio workout for you."
1,NOT FOR BEGINNERS AS SUGGESTED,"This woman is not professional when it comes to instructing. There is too much ""assumption"" that the viewer knows what she in referring to. Beginning is just that...for those that have not done this before. Not impressed and so much so, I returned it for a full refund."
2,workout,Not what I expected. Not sure this is what I ment to order. I'll try again with another type of workout
2,Not what expected,"I bought this for my 19 years old daughter who loved dancing and exercising, but she is not happy with it."
2,Not sure yet,"Have just tried it once. Didn't seem to have a lot of step by step directions. I'm sure it's just me, though. I'll try it again to see if I like it better. Right now, I really shouldn't judge it too much."
2,You better know Zumba,Did not love this dvd. If you aren't zumba experienced it's not for you. Music wasn't fantastic so I wouldn't recommend.
5,good workout,good workout did not take much to work up a sweat. Had to stop and watch some of the step combos but was able to catch on. Loved the beat.
2,"fun, but not quite what I expected","This dance-exercise video is entertaining and fun. However, I thought there would be different Brazilian/African music instead of the one rhythm they use throughout. I am a person who likes diversity. I will watch and participate in the video occasionally but find other workouts more rewarding."
3,It's ok,"Fun moves but difficult to move easily on a carpet. Also, after the workout, I felt that I would have liked something longer. I did not like the way the flow breaks as she begins from the top very often."
3,certainly a cardio workout!,"The warm up definitely gets you warmed up!This is a high impact, high intensity, full on work out.I don't really like her as a presenter, and she chats a bit too much with the other people. That bit is annoying.It is also very full on. I think that you need to know your own body quite well, as there are lots of long loose throwing body parts around movements. You want to be careful you don't put anything out.As a workout, I guess it has a lot going for it. I prefer things where I feel like I am dancing, and even though I could recognise a lot of moves, and see them as dance, I didn't feel like I was dancing."
2,"non-dancer, non-friendly","I've never done a dance workout video before and probably won't try anymore. I didn't like how fast she expected people to understand the movements and the steps. For those less coordinated individuals, or true beginners like myself, she didn't go slower or have someone there who was doing beginner steps while she was doing a more advanced regime. There are a few times where she wants people to whip their head around, which hurt my neck, too. In my opinion, this might be a good DVD for people who have had dance experience, or have used other dance type DVDs, but this is not a good one for ""beginners"" as it states in the title. The cover says ""leaves you sweating for more"" but I stopped mid way and was more confused and annoyed than wanting more. I'll stick with my Jillian Michaels and yoga DVDs instead. (which is what I did after turning this one off)"
5,exercise dvd,"My daughter wanted a exercise dvd for Christmas, so I got this for her. She was very pleased. It is in good shape and came promptly. Good service. Thank you, Shirley J. Herson"
2,It's hard to follow MaDonna Grimes.,MaDonna Grimes is hard to follow. It is very fast paced and there is not enough time alowed to get used to the moves.
3,It's okay,"It's an okay dance video. There is really only one dance that she teaches. Okay for the low price. She says ""Party"" too much."
4,Can be more,It is good dancing moves. but the number of features are very less. could have been more for a Dvd.
3,It's pretty easy,This DVD is easy to follow. I wish there was a little more zumba attitude to it though and more latin music.
2,?,"She moves way to fast... and for a person who just had a baby, I didnt feel welcomed... I felt rushed and decided it wasn't for me."
3,The video was just okay,"I was hoping this video would inspire me to want to dance, but it seemed to lack enthusiasm. I have only had it on twice and can't seem to want to dance."
5,i'm the heat because of this video,"This is an easy to do, step by step exercise. I enjoy it every morning. Never a drag. Thanks Madonna!"
3,It's Okay,"It was way,way too fast. All started out without much beginner steps..and if your not a normal up to par dancer, 'you'd wish you was to keep up. That title 'Beginners' was why I choosed the dvd. I was disapointed,and I had even ordered a 2nd one for my sis. She felt the same way."
2,Not for me,I can't deny that MaDonna Grimes is an excellent dancer... but I am not. I just don't have the rythum that she does so following along wasn't the easiest. The pace and steps weren't that difficult... but the movements and motions are for those with a internal beat. Being from the MidWest... I inadvertanley turned the AFrican Beat with Latin Heat into a country line dance... which was actually kind of fun. I ordered this DVD because a lot of my friends were raving about Zumba and I 'thought' this was a beginners version. I must have misread the description. Oh well.
3,Fun way to stay fit,"This video is a great encouragement to keep moving and fit. The moves are fairly simple, and the video includes a warm up & cool down. Although it can get a bit repetitive doing the same routine regularly, it's a quick way to achieve a daily work-out."
3,dance video,"The video arrived in good condition and in good time. However, I'm disappointed in the video itself. I was expecting more latin dvd like the zumba dvds. Oh well! I use it still and do what I can."
2,Disappointed,"Usually in ""beginner"" workout or dance CDs you are shown the basic steps first. In this one she goes right into dance routines and I very quickly got lost and had to keep starting over!Disappointing-would call it Level II or something else."
2,not for beginners,"the tape stated that it was for beginners so that's why i purchased it. i thought it would show ho to do the moves, thought it would be slower to catch on but it was full out fast paced dancing. i wouldn't recommend it for beginners."
3,excersize easy,This definetly helps to start learning some moves and building up your ability so that you can work up to taking zumba classes to get in shape.
4,Madonna Grimes Dance,"I get a good workout each time I use it! Just what I needed, thanks, Madonna Grimes & dancing friends."
3,none,It was not what i needed but im sure someone else would enjoy it.This would be better for people who like to do dance steps.
1,dance exercise review,I was trying to order the new Zumba dance exercise dvd and got this one by mistake but I tried it anyway and it is way too fast for a beginner like me. I did not like it at all and was very disappointed.
1,Not good!,I thought when I read someone else's review that it would be good. NO do not order this. Yeah she may teach you in sections but it is so fast and onething right after the other you do not even get a chance to learn anything.
3,Dance Exercise,MaDonna Grimes Dance Fitness for beginners gives a good cardio workout and makes you sweat. I do find it a little hard to follow her quick instructions but at least I'm up and moving.
4,Love the workout..wish it was a little longer..,I was suprised I really like this dvd. My only problem is its so short! I always work up a sweat but as soon as I start getting into it its over. My favorite that my son loves to do the gang gang:) Great video.
3,Dance Fitness for Beginners with MaDonna Grimes,It's a good DVD for the 30's group or 40's year old but not for us that much older than that. I really didn't think that it was beginner for my age group. But what I was able to do of the warm ups is OK.
3,Disappointing,"While MaDonna Grimes did a nice job overall,for the low price that this dvd costs, I found it to be disappointing. The workout is short and repetitious. There is not enough variety of movements. There is some time wasted at the end with miscellanous dancing and time-fillers that could have been used for a longer workout. Too much talking/distractions, I feel.The warm up was like a mini workout (not really a warm up with stretching, etc). And the music was terrible. The beat is not exciting and in no way is it ""African beat-Latin heat,"" as the ad implies.(At some point, I'm sure I heard trumpets and then violins! I wanted the real HEAT of the African beat like it says it has! There was no Latin influence, too. So the description is all wrong.) It has the same terrible drum tapping that made it somewhat annoying to listen to. I was expecting exciting background music to workout to. It definitely left me wanting more, and I wasn't sweating."
2,wasn't up to expectations,the instructor was not clear on dance steps. Didn't give enough warm up or coaching time. Music was what we expected. would not recommend it for a Zumbia class
3,"A Little Disappointing, I thought","Dance Fitness for Beginners with MaDonna Grimes: African Beat - Latin HeatMaybe the most disappointing thing is that the lesson is way too short for a really good workout. I recently started taking zumba classes, and I'm completely sold on the idea of dance to get my cardio in! But the zumba classes are super demanding, partly because they're a full hour of non-stop fun. No talking, we just follow the instructor who gives us visual cues only and plays the most fun music! This doesn't really compare to that, so I'm still looking for a great dance workout. Madonna is delightful, and so are her team of dancers. I would like them to do something more advanced, not so much in terms of moves as intensity."
2,I agree...NOT for beginners,The other reviews said she shows the steps and the transitions. I didn't see that at all. It was way too fast to be a beginner.
2,Hard to follow,"I wanted a beginner's dance video. This is not a beginner's dance video. It is very difficult to follow. The music is great but unless you have had some type of training, you may find this a bit difficult."
2,Where Are The Ques?!,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. While Ms. Grimes has a lot of enthusiasm, she is not very good at queing. More often than not, she's asking her dancers how they're doing. It would be much more helpful if she were queing rather than talking to the other dancers. The camera style doesn't help either, changing angles right when the instructor changes the routine and shooting from the hips up so, we can't follow what their feet are doing. Five minutes into this DVD I got so frustrated, I took it out of the DVD player and it is now destined to be a donation to my local library."
2,for Beginners?,"WOW I must have missed the boat when It comes to understanding the work Beginnerthis is a DVD for someone who already knows the steps and the beat/countsthe Instructer acts like we have been in her class for quite a while.for me if this were for true beginners there would be a primer for each step""OK here is what I want on the next step"" there is none. it starts off doing the steps andassumes that the person/people that are following along know what to do.It will take more than a few start/stops before I can even be able to follow the entire DVDI will master the DVD but for Beginners it is not"
2,Not for beginners,I was looking for something slower; explaining each move before going putting it all together. Pace was too fast and quick. Could not keep up. Definitely not for beginners.
3,"good workout, but I want more!","I enjoyed this dance workout very much. However, there was only 1 roughly 25-minute dance workout. I did it twice, but I don't think I could keep doing it because then I'd just get sick of it. I wish there were more dance routines on there for Grimes to teach us, but there wasn't. I'm a little disappointed..."
4,Great Despites some Reviews,"I was leary about purchasing this dvd due to the reviews I read of no instruction and the moves were hard. MaDonna Grimes does tell you the moves that are coming up to do. I suggest with any dvd work out, watch it first and then try it, that way you will see the difference in transitioning. You will break a sweat. Love the bonus 10 minute workout that really works the core, hams and quads. I recommend this video. Stick with it, yes you will sweat despite what you read. I suggest doing it on a flat service and not carpet for free flow foot action. No it's not one to take to the dance floor, but does exactly what you need at home burning calories with cardio. She has a warm personality, I've used it for two weeks and can tell the difference."
3,Something is missing.........,"This was my first time buying a Madonna Grimes fitness DVD. I thought it was fun and the instructor was very warm and personable. The moves were a little bit tricky, but I decided I loved it. Just as I was getting into it and start to settle in for a good low impact workout...........IT WAS OVER!!! I didn't even start to break a sweat; Very disappointing."
1,Awful!,"This DVD is NOT for beginners. I'm not a dancer and she was throwing dance moves out that I had no idea what they meant. I bought this from the reviews, but I was really disappointed. It's not much fun to do when you don't know what the heck is going on. The music is boring and even if I knew what she was talking about, it wouldn't be something I'd want to listen to over and over. Would not recommend for anyone."
1,not for beginners,this dvd is difficult for a beginner. she doesn't explain anything at all. if i could had given it 0 stars i would have.
2,I think of myself as a good dancer but....,"I bought this because it had such good reviews. I have always been a good dancer and have always been told that. I know one or two simple Latin steps, but when I watched this video I was totally off key and pretty much got frustrated and turned it off after 15 minutes. #1, they go way too fast and don't review the steps well enough, for enough time. and #2 the camera person cuts off the dancers from the knees down in a lot of the scenes and therefore if you can not remember exactly where your feet are supposed to be going yet you can't watch the screen to get a clue. I suggest a few begging scenes in the DVD on each step so that during the video everyone may follow along easier AND the camera person should show Madonna's entire body throughout the DVD so everyone can follow along. I thought I would have no problem with this video, but feel like I just put $10 in the garbage disposal."
2,Beginners?,I have decided to get fit this year and saw this video labeled Beginners. Well I dont know about that. It goes pretty fast and I am not coordinated enough to keep up with the video.
3,"A fun dance routine, but not a great workout","I've never been one to enjoy working out, so when I gained a few pounds (15 or so), I started looking for a fun way to jump-start a daily exercise routine. While I really enjoy doing this routine, I don't really find it to be challenging as a workout. Learning the dance moves takes a little time, but that really is the most challenging aspect. If you're at or near your goal weight, perhaps this would be a good maintenance workout; but to lose weight and really get in shape, I have had to look elsewhere and now only do this routine on occasion for a fun change of pace. I should note, however, that I really like the 10-minute bonus workout and will often do it before the dance routine for some added benefit."
3,almost too easy,"At 166 lbs. and 5/3 inches tall. I decided to start working out again. I haven't worked out AT ALL in four years. This workout interested me because it seemed fun and came up when I searched for ""thigh"" workouts. It is fun, I consider myself a fairly good dancer. After three weeks, there is still one key move that I can't seem to master and I'm not sure the people on video do either. Madonna is fun and motivating in her voice. It doesn't take long to master the steps. You can really get steps down good by the third workout. However, I was barely out of breath and hardly broke a sweat even giving it my all. For me, it may be the best way to start if you are extremely overweight and out of shape. But to me, it just wasn't what I need. I will say the bonus abs and squats are good for toning, but I have never even felt any soreness."
1,Definitely not fpr beginners!,I was looking for something that showed how to do the steps of the dance for a beginner! This goes right into the dance with no help at all! Would not recommend!
3,Not for Beginners,"The title is very misleading.If you have no dance experience, this DVD is very hard to follow.It assumes that you know how to dance, and it moves way too fast for the true beginner."
3,For the Expert,"This Video is much to difficult for me and the music is pretty boring. Sure would be a good workout for someone in much better shape than I am. MaDonna is great, but the music is a very boring beat."
2,Beginners?,"I bought this DVD thinking I'd be able to learn the basics of Zumba, so that I could join my friends in their Zumba class. I tried the Dance Fitness for Beginners with MaDonna Grimes a few times and decided that it is definately not for beginners. There's not enough review of the steps and it's too fast for beginners.When I told my friends what I was doing, they said they will teach me. I would not recommend this Dance Fitness for beginner Zumba's."
1,Wrong product,"I initial thought I was ordering the Beginners Zumba, I then get a case which states it is Africian Beat/ Latin heat. Inside the case was a completely different disk for Belly Dancing. Very disappointed."
3,Dance Fitness,The music is ok. I expected a somewhat faster beat. It is not what I expected although there were some clues from the other reviews. It is good for beginners but the instruction are a little late and you may need to watch it a few times to keep up. It does provide a good workout on days when I can't get outside.
5,Good workout.,I'm 61 and have had double knee replacement due to arthritis. This video was not as hard as I thought it would be; but it's still a good workout.
3,"Not ""all that"" But ok",Cover says you can take moves to the clubs...please dont! lol Not really for beginners but she does go over the steps a few times for us. Only about 20mins long! I didnt sweat as much as they did on the dvd..but then again maybe I was doing it wrong. Claims to be a bonus work-out at the end but really its just time for them to show off and add mins to the already short dvd.
3,Dance fitness for beginners with Madonna Grimes,"You have to really be in the mood for this one. She is funny and entertaining, not a lot of a routine I would like on everyday basis"
1,Less than engaging,"The music IMHO was less than engaging.Sounded a bit dated. It was one of the lesser priced Dance Fitness Discs, but probaly a good example of,""you get what you pay for"". I tossed it."
2,Poor reproduction,A very poor standard of scanning - many black marks and illegible text. Such a shame when the content of the work is so interesting
2,"Lots of information for PS3, some for PSP, shallow coverage","This is the ""offical"" magazine, so it doesn't say anything bad, critical or truly objective of the PS3 or PSP. PS2 coverage is getting less and less, which is no surprise. The reviews are often written from the first-person perspective which makes one wonder if the editors of this magazine have huge egos. I also hate the fact in every issue, they extol the virtues of the iPhone and in every issue they tell you to go buy one. Why are these people giving free advertising to Apple products?I subscribe to it because it's the only PS3-centric magazine on the market, and it does contain quite a bit of info on the PS3 and, to a lesser extent, PSP. There's also more PSN coverage which is a good thing.Still, I keep getting frustrated reading in every issue how everyone and their grandma should get an iPhone. Man, Steve Jobs should have been our president."
1,Warning! Always a month delay!,"I got a 1 year subscription through Amazon with a great half price discount.The magazine is good.However, I always get the magazine a month after it has been released on the street.May be, this is why I got it cheap.Anyway, people need to aware they may possible to get it late (a month later)."
3,Once great,This magazine was once awesome. Loved it when it came with stuff like demos. Wish there were behind the scene videos or something. I live in hawaii and these magazines always came late to the point I've already read the news elsewhere.
2,It's not what it seems to be.,For those who hasn't caught on this mag isnt Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine. Its not by the same people and doesn't carry the same quality. Its by the same people that write Playstation magazine. As far as i know Ziff Davis Inc. aren't publishing playstation mags anymore. As far as this magazine goes i give it 2 out of 5 stars. The do tend to give there own pennon and less facts more times then not. There are some good articles somtimes but hard to find. They do have a nice release date for up and coming games. In all if you coming for a OPM revival youll end up feeling empty inside. But if you want a playstation magazine to read and not that picky its fine.
3,Have not received it.,"I like magazine, I'm a subscriber myself. I ordered this subscription for my brother and he is yet to receive his first issue."
1,Magazine Subscription thru Amazon,"This isn't Playstation magazine review but rather complaint about Amazon's poor Customer Service regarding magazine subscription.I wish I could review this magazine but promised delivery date of October 26, 2009 came and went.I contacted Amazon and was told: ""Your order was placed through an independent sales agency and it will be necessary for you to contact them.""They did not elaborate who is ""them"", no name, phone number or e-mail address.It did not occur to Amazon that, maybe I do not have time or inclination to do the work of their Customer Service.Well, so much for entertaining an absurd idea of buying magazine subscription thru Amazon.Sorry folks for venting my frustration, but I couldn't help myself - hey, I got an email from Amazon encouraging me to review my ""magazine purchase""."
2,Below Average,"This is a blatently biast magazine, but what's worse is the fact that the editing is horrible. The attempt at jokes is far too often, and are usually not even remotely funny. There is hardly any preview space, only reviews and useless info. I recommend a multi-system videogame mag, such as Gameinformer, or EGM."
4,could be better,"Magazines like this should give out codes to ps games for free stuff sometimes and even games every once in a blue moon but...I do like the pictures,lol and keeping updated on latest games and releases."
3,"good content, but not a lot of it","i know print has been hurting, and it shows here. the magazine is thinner (and a higher percentage ads) than similar ones a decade ago. that being said, the content is quite good."
2,The Absolute Worst for Subscription Service!!,"Playstation: The Official Magazine isn't a bad gaming magazine at all . . . the content is decent, and the reviews aren't bad either. It's just the service that sucks!!! I just got my renewal notice in the mail today, and over the course of my subscription thus far, I missed THREE (3)...count 'em...THREE magazines!! What can possibly account for this act of gross, heinous negligence? I'm certainly not the only customer to voice my concerns about this serious issue. You can read for yourself the other negative reviews on here.To be honest, this was my first magazine subscription that I've ever bought through Amazon, and it's definitely going to be the last. If not receiving the appropriate amount of issues per year is going to be a concern, why bother with it ever again? Makes no sense to me...TWO STARS (really should be one star, but I gave an extra star for content)"
4,i like this magazine,"I have subscribed to this magazine for over 2 years now and I love it. PTOM always has interesting articles about the industry and has awesome previews for upcoming titles. The one thing I don't rely on with PTOM is their reviews however, which always seem to be very high no matter which game it is."
5,PS3 Owners Need to Subscribe to This Mag!!,This is an A++ magazine. I have owned many gaming magazine in my lifetime and the PlayStation is the best magazine for content. They have excellent reviews of blu-ray movies that are new and you need to rent/buy. I wish I would have known about this magazine sooner. Buy this!!
4,good magazine,I used read this magazine before they came out with play station 2 and it was the best back then for information on everything play station so I cant imagine it could be any different.
3,A steal for $5...,Remember to go into your profile and UNclick the auto renewal after the purchase. Ain't worth it above that cost by the by~
2,"Less Issues Than You'd Expect, Better Off Reading Online.","To sum things up:- You miss at least 1 issue upon subscription due to the time it takes to process subscription.- Information is outdated or very brief so by the time you get the magazine there is a lot more available for free on the internet than you can find in the magazine itself.- Very shallow reviews on most games, some annoying bias on others.- You don't get the final issue of your subscription either.Sure $10 for a ""year"" of Playstation Magazine (or other magazines like 360 or Nintendo from the same publisher) or even less you'd think this would be worthy of a shot, I know I did. I was mistaken and I would not have done it had I known what I listed above. I decided to give this a shot but even their supposedly exclusive content isn't worthy of anything as it is always outdated.Don't give this a shot, it isn't worth it even for $5 dollars. Look things up online or on developer websites, it is free and more up to date."
1,"Good magazine, BAD distribution","This is not in regard to the magazine (which is solid and enjoyable), but rather a review of the service provided. I subscribed back in mid Sept. I received my first issue in Oct. and I only recently received my 2nd issue the Jan 2011 issue earlier this week! This sporadic delivery is unacceptable. I implore all would be subscribers to go through another means of subscription, the joke of a company that Amazon hired to distribute its magazines is garbage."
1,No magazine,I hve not recieved a single issue of the magazine yet. I would like to get the magazine or havey money refunded.
3,The dress is great but the shipping quality was bad,"The dress came in a soft package, when I opened the package the dress was wrapped well but completely folded into a small roll which made the dress have wrinkles.After I got over the way it was shipped the dress is actually very pretty and when I have it professionally steamed to get all the wrinkles out it will be very lovely. However, the dress should not need to be pressed if it had come in a box and shipped properly. It will cost me at least $20 or more to get this done which makes me feel I did not save any money going through amazon and this company."
4,"Film Music of Ralph Vaughan Williams, Vol. 2","This CD features the score Vaughan Williams wrote for the 1941 British film 49th Parallel. The music is a series of musical portraits of various parts of the film. The film itself was an effort to bring to the United States the story of how Canada was helping the British war effort. The hope was that the United States would soon become an ally of Great Britain in its war against the Nazi's. While the music for the film has been preserved, there is no current DVD copy of the film for region 1. Turner Classic Movies shows the film from time to time."
2,Needs better information,"I ordered the PSD-200 and it was the wrong size. The PSD-210 would have fit my shower correctly, but I couldn't tell that, because the dimensions given for each part were useless. I needed to know the inner and outer diameters of the connector, but the PSD-200 gave a length and width (for a circular part?)and the PSD 210 description gave no info, at all. (The two parts have the same inner diameter, but the PSD-210 has a larger outer diameter.)I wound up taking the old connector (or what remained of it) to a local plumbing supply house and they matched it with a PSD 210 from their stock.I like being able to order parts like this online, but the descriptions need to be better."
2,Mediocre Mystery Movie !,"Even though I own most of the ""Poirot Offerings"" starring David Suchet owing to my affinity for Agatha Christie's work,I still maintain that ""Peter Ustinov"" is by far more at home in ""Poirot's"" shoes as evident by his inimitable performences as the belgian eccentric/sleuth over the years.particularly in the ""Death on the Nile""(1978).And having said that, the latest addition to A&E's Poirot caper of the same name featuring Suchet is unfortunately ""Toothles and Meandering"" at best.In short,If you already own the Original ( Ustinov )version,then don't even bother spending your hard-earned on this trite."
1,Poirot should have detected this remake really Sucked.,Really rushed and other than Suchet ... the acting was terrible by most of the cast..
1,Noxious,"I certainly don't believe the Ustinov version is perfect (it's not), but the newer Suchet version is a disaster. How people think this is loyal to the book is beyond me. Maybe in form but not in substance. Characters who are well-developed in the book, like the Allertons, are made into completely repellent caricatures in the film. Much of the acting has a campy, brittle quality, like Noel Coward on a very off day. It's a shame, because this is one of Christie's best novels, both in terms of plot and character. Unfortunately, the director and screenwriters had little respect for Christie's novel. A total misfire, like the dreadful versions of Blue Train and Cards on the Table."
2,May be too graphic for some children,"When David kills Goliath, blood spurts from his head wound and continues to flow as he dies onscreen. I had to turn it off before David cut off Goliath's head. I didn't finish watching it because my daughter was too upset. This video was much too graphic for my daughter and, in my opinion, for an animated Bible video."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this video to watch with my 4 year old grandson. I had a hard enough time with the 'time travelers', (I'd prefer it to be accurate and not fanciful), but when David hit Goliath in the head and blood spurted, it was a little unnerving and a little too gory. Then shortly after it shows Goliath falling and blood is still going everywhere. I'm pretty sure him just falling would have been enough to get the point across. Probably will not try any more of this series."
3,Shades of Sandy Denny,"There is a timeless quality to this album that is reminiscent of Sandy Denny (who, in my opinion, is the greatest female vocalist of all time, not to mention a great songwriter). The mix of traditional and contemporary covers, plus the fine original material, bodes well for future releases. I can't wait to hear what Ms. Baird will come out with next. I sense limitless possibilities."
1,This golf game never scores a hole in one.,"I wasted my money when I bought this game, from the reviews I had seen, I thought that this was a game that you built and played your own golf course. You never play the course and the graphics are terrible. Simgolf is far better than this one (and I have that too). I would not recommend purchasing this game."
4,Helpful Guide for a New Author,"An excellent source of information and help for the unpublished and struggling new writer. It gives you help in every aspect of writing - creating an outline, writing a first draft, making revisions and (most importantly of all!) writing a proposal and sending it out to potential agents. Some elements of the book I already knew - it has a list of ""ten commandments"" to writing a book, I knew about half of them going in, but even so - they were very informative. The biggest strength of the book lies in the appendix where examples of proposals are and where Mr. Shaw gives you step by step instructions in preparing your own. I would strongly recommend this book to any new author trying to find an agent and ultimately a publisher - definitely a good investment."
5,Daunting No More,"Book Report is a very useful guide that I turned to again and again while crafting my book proposal. I was impressed by the author's ability to not only cover the nuts and bolts of writing a proposal, but also to succinctly convey what makes a quality proposal. Particularly useful were the parenthetical tips the author inserted throughout samples in the appendix. With Mark Shaw's style and ability to anticipate writers' questions and omissions, I felt like I had a mentor by my side leading me through what had been a daunting process."
5,"Presenting the ""ten golden rules of publishing"",","Book Report: Publishing Strategies, Writing Tips, And 101 Literary Ideas For Aspiring Authors And Poets is a solid collection of nicely presented writing tips and publishing strategies for aspiring writers and poets seeking publication. Presenting the ""ten golden rules of publishing"", including ""write a story you are passionate about - one that is marketable""; ""take notice - rejection is not part of a writer's vocabulary""; and ""you are what you write - protect yourself""; Book Report is a timely, welcome, and thoroughly ""user friendly"" advice guide which is very highly recommended reading for aspiring authors and novice poets wanting the kind of readership audience that only being published can achieve."
5,Excellent book on creating the life you want.,"I treasure this book. I first read this book when it came out 10 years ago. I have read it a total of 4 times now. It is a truly remarkable book because it relates the creative process to the physical laws of nature to which we are all subject. This is the path of least resistance, along which all energy including creative energy will flow. It takes a while to understand the writing. It is not a self help or quick fix book. It is not a book on descipline or willpower. It is a book that explains how to change the underlying structure of your life to create the life you want. It must be understood both intellectually and experientially as you practice examining your current situation at the same time you hold the vision you want to create. Robert Fritz does a wonderful job of using very simple examples to demonstrate the dynamics of the ""least resistance"" principle."
1,dont buy,I did'nt understand what did tried to tell me. very complicated and i am not new to creating reality. do not buy
4,Makes creativity accessible,"I like that Fritz mostly deals with your relationship to life. Some of his topics are: reality is not an enemy; it is important to make conscious choices; it is more effective to choose what you want rather than avoid what you don't want. What I appreciated most in this book was the section on making fundamental choices. Examples of fundamental choices: freedom; to be true to yourself; to be healthy. From conscious choices such as these you develop your primary and secondary choices. Fritz makes the creative process accessible to anyone, whether you want to create art, a business, satisfying relationships, or an artful life."
3,"Creative, original thinker writes dense prose.","I liked the beginning (describing inadequacies of current ways of thinking about change) and the end (summary intentions), but the middle, his proscriptions for action were complicated. It made me want to read more books by Fritz, to see if he simplified his action proscriptions in subsequent books"
2,hard to get through,"fritz really has no value for mainsteam psycho therapy but his alternative ""structure"" of changing your life isn't very well presented. he get's bogged down in his structure schematics and after a while I lost interest. I don't think I got much out of this book."
3,businessman,A good book to reinforce the importance of creating a vision of the future you want and staying focused to attain it.
4,Famous Fighters of WW2 parade,"Being already published in 1957, and again in 1962 and 1975, this book was for years one of the standard references about WW2 fighter aircraft. Since 1975 however, there has been sustantially more published about WW2 fighters than between 1945 and 1975, and though not all of those publications had new material compared to this one, quite a few did and quite a few of the new monographs about WW2 fighter planes were a lot more thorough, often discovering things in addition to this book or even sometimes contradicting it. Nevertheless it remains one of the best quick references for silhouetes and open airframe drawings, which have been used by Mr. Green over and over again in his later standard references such as the ten volume ""Warplanes of the second World War"" or the twelve volume ""WW2 Aircraft Fact Files"", both published by Macdonald and/or Jane's"
1,THIS IS A FAKE RIP OFF,THIS IS NOT THE BUZZ 2 YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS IS ALL CRAPPY UNKNOW ARTISTS !!! THIS IS NOT THE BUZZ 2 YOU SAW ON TV OR THE SECOND DISC TO THE FIRST SET! IT IS JUST JUNK!!!
5,A Life-Changing Book,"I completly disagree with the review that Kirkus Reviews has posted. This book changed my life after I read it. Like Nancy, I became pregnant in high school with the only reasonable alternative to be adoption. After speaking with a number of agencies, I decided that I wouldn't be able to place my child in the traditional, closed adoption. I loved the idea of open adoption because I could continue to see my son and keep in contact with him while continuing on with my own life. When he comes of age and understands what the situation is, I will be able to tell him why I made my decision and why I placed him. He won't question my love for him since I have played such an active role in his life. I understand that some people, birth parents as well as adoptive parents, may not agree or feel they could be a part of this type of relationship, but we think it works just fine for us."
2,"Passable art; story starts strong, but falls off","""Vexille"" is set is a future where Japan has created an extreme degree of isolation for itself. Attacks on the U.S. occur, and are traced back to the closed nation.The anime was not terribly innovative, and the quality was only OK. The story started off pretty well, with a dramatic opening and some interesting relationships developing, but loses its way among existential angst and the dread of losing ones identity in a post-industrial age.I watched it in English. I may have lost something that was communicated by the original.Overall, it just not that engaging, and didn't inspire me enough to watch it again and try to understand it better.E. M. Van Court"
3,3D animation like it's ment to be!!,If your a fan on quality animation...this is 1 that should be in your collection.
5,EXCELLENT!!!,All I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is a visual treat! I was shocked and awed by the complexity of the computer animation and the detail. The behind the scenes extras were also very interesting and made me more aware of how hard it is to create and promote a movie like this.

3,"great background & non-human visuals, ho-hum action story","There are some very nice CGI backgrounds and non-human visuals in this movie, but the human character designs seem to use lazy man's version of animating modern anime human faces, ie: use motion capture, then paint with pastel like colors over the actor. Sure, it's lazy, but it also looks too fake, and really doesn't use any artistic imagination. The story is run of the mill action, not overly interesting."
4,"Decent story, good animation","I was impressed with the overall story in Vexille. I'd put it in the same category as Appleseed or Ghost in the Shell (the latter having even more complicated plot lines). i thought the animation was good but not great. It was a little over the top, in my view, looking too animated. I thought it lacked sublety, if that makes any sense.Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie. Probably should have waited for the special edition because I usually enjoy the features and this version didn't have any."
4,Pretty good sci-fi show,"I am not much of an anime fan, but I do like a good sci-fi show and this one was pretty good.The animation of everything that was non-human was fantastic (in my newbie-to-anime eyes). The metallic structures were perfect. The sunsets, explostions, splatters, etc. were wonderfully done. The human faces (and to some extent, the body movements) were not as good - but that is understandable. We humans spend so much time actively looking at faces and body language as compared to cars, sunsets and explosions, that the art cannot stand up to that type of detail.Anyway, the story is pretty strong, although you need to pay attention - sometimes they over-narrate and sometimes there's none at all. I got a bit confused when with the two main female characters' (Vexille and Maria) similarity to one another.Nonetheless, I liked it. Recommended for sci-fi fans."
2,Quite bad,"If you took all the worst elements of a Resident Evil game, and all the worst elements of a Final Fantasy game, mixed them up, made a movie from it, and set it in the future, this is what you would get.This movie has no discernible plot, awkward pacing, and hollow characters. The setting is boring and unbelievable. The acting is merely tolerable, and the animation is just ok."
1,vexille movie,i saw 20 seconds of this movie on animefuel ...ha.. i dont know who you guys are but this is not worth 2 or more stars..terrible fake voice for everyone ..same computer voice for girl and guy. aweful graphics. or what graphics?? haha buy at your own risk... buy a crap disaster if you want...
2,Starts off strong and goes downhill,"This movie had an awesome opening and maintains energy for the first 60 minutes. Then there is a big reveal, huge suspension of disbelief, and a rather unsatisfying final sequence. I'm a big fan of anime but the lame story execution fails to live up to its interesting premise"
3,Let Down,"Alright. So I was wanting to watch this movie for a while. I saw it at Target, and I loved the Appleseed movies. So I was hopeful for it and plugged it on my family's netflix queue-after my mom wouldn't let me rent it at blockbuster. Now I'm glad she stopped me.Normally I only half watch things, turning on my faithful Laptop Toshi and sign onto aim. For Vexille, I didn't. I dimmed the lights and watched it in my room alone.It started good. It could have been a very good movie.Until it turned depressing.The animation was gorgeous. But the story was horribly depressing. The ending, very Japanese, left hope for the future after massive tragedy.But hey, if that's your sort of thing, go ahead."
2,Original Plot. Cliche Characters.,"The plot to this movie is what grabbed my attention the most. The idea of an isolated Japan is a nice modernization of history, and has the level of political complexity that I usually appreciate in a movie. Unfortunately, that was about as far as it went for me with this film. All of the other details were trite and cliche, and too often the characters and the Type-A, military dialog are ripped right out of the typical action movie playbook. The umpteenth attempt at hardened, take-charge personalities that offer a glimmer of sensitivity is, at this point, dull characterization. With such a promising plot-line, there may have been a better angle at the story so that the characters were as original as the plot."
3,Vexille was quite Vexing,"Although this is a good looking animated movie, it just wasn't up to par as such greats like the most recent blockbusters like the Appleseed movies. As was the storyline as well.Compared to Appleseed, this movie is Slooooooow!Good concept, but a snails pace delivery. The payoff at the end wasn't worth the $20 I spent. Even the Final Fantasy movies are much better than this.What a shame they put such money and talented time in these endeavors, but don't come out with a sci-fi blockbuster.After purchasing and watching tons of these japanese animae movies,with all their obvious love of robotics and action, I just can't understand how no one has created a Warhammer fully CGI movie. The games and books are obviously huge and popular, but no film feature...?I'd much rather pay to see that, than this what passed for an OK movie."
3,Light Entertainment,"I am not a huge Anime fan but this looked interesting. My initial impression is correct, interesting, engaging and fun. This is a turn off your mind, loosen your belt, sit back and enjoy movie. There is a story that will not require much thought but you need to accept the underlying premise. The dialog is not Shakespearian either. It tells the story and is not stupid or insulting. The visuals are quite good and the animation is very well done. I found this a fun film but did not take it seriously. If you are looking for an intelligent drama, sorry this isn't it. If you want some light entertainment with good animation, consider this one."
1,"Confusing, dumbed-down, and insulting.","Just another anime project trying to come up with some deep look at how technology changes us while not ACTUALLY KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IN THE FIRST PLACE. Don't waste your time. By the time one of the characters mentioned ""bio metal,"" my brain had escaped the confines of my skull and was making a beeline for the blender. Don't insult your intelligence by watching this."
2,Basic Anime Sci-Fi,"This was a basic Anime Sci-Fi. While watching it, at time I could predict what they were going to say right before they said it. I hate to say it, but it was a real stinker."
2,So-So,"It's all in the eye of the beholder really, but my eye rates this as sub-par. Let me start by saying that I bought this based on reviews that said it was very similar to the Appleseed series. I enjoyed Appleseed Ex Machina immensely, and this ....... is nothing like it. Not sure why reviewers even draw a similarity with Appleseed. The story is a little weak and ultimately forgettable, and it seems like a lot less time was spent designing the CGI when compared to Ex Machina.In all I wasn't too thrilled about the storyline and the CGI and animation were just ""ok"". If I had the choice I would not buy this again. I'll give it another watch and see if my attitude changes, but for now it's a pass."
5,A++,This had a really good story which to me is the top priority in anything I watch. I'm also a fan of Appleseed. I didn't like the story of Appleseed: Ex Machina to give you idea of my tastes. The animation on this was great. If I only had one complaint it would be some of the CGI visualization looked to real and I like it to be more animation and less realism.
3,An Apple-seed Knock Off,"While this movie presents unique characters (at least by name), it appears that the computer models from Appleseed have been re-cycled into this movie. This will include the body armour suit used.Hence the overall quality is just about the same as that of Appleseed. The infection concept of Exmachina Appleseed is also replicated in this film, albeit taken to a new level though.There are a lot of tight action scenes, and there is a mass suicide scene that leaves much to be desired. This movie will be good if you are really bored on an evening and just want someting to watch."
3,Nice... but subtitles completly off....,"Hi,I loved Vexille the first time I saw it, even if it got flaws, i still enjoyed it!I have the DVD version, but as I got a new TV and blu ray player, I thought of buying this version.The image quality is great, and sounds is amazing... but... the subtitles don't match at all...They are totally different from the DVD version, and if u play the english dub with english subtitles, you will understand. It doesn't match the Japanese voice either... I dunno why they had to redo the sub, because on the DVD version it was perfect.But it's kind of confusing, it's out of synchro, and it's just wrong 25% of the time.I guess if you watch the japanese version with english dub, the wrong translation won't affect you (in case you actually don't understand japanese). But will still be kind of out of synchro.A little disappointed..."
4,Great sci-fi adventure,"Recently caught this one one Netflix streaming and it was a great way to spend two hours. In the near future Japan has cut itself off from the rest of the world. And tucked away in their veil of darkness something evil is brewing. It takes a crack team of American commandos to breach the high tech defenses and get to the bottom of the mystery of what exactly is happening in the orient.The animation is quite good and reminded me of a highly polished, extended cutscene from a good video game. In fact, I'm surprised that they haven't turned this one into an outing for the Xbox 360 or PS3. The storyline is quite intriguing as the lead character finds herself behind enemy lines with unlikely allies. I especially liked the metallic monsters who were one-offs of the Dune sand worms.So, in summary... good animation, great action, and a fun way to spend an evening immersed in the not too distant future. Vexille is worth a look."
1,Hated it.,"I got this after reading all the glowing review that said "" Better than Appleseed"" . Yeah right. This movie had a cool premise , Japan sealed off , special team going in to check it out , sounds cool but the final product is just awful. The super ultimate special combat team acted like they were complete idiots , SPOILER , they sneak past all this high tech security measures to set up a transmitter , do they set up in a nice out of the way location ? Hell no! , they set up in a container storage lot under some street lights , and surprise, they they get spotted and attacked.On the plus side the graphics were cool.I could go on about how dumb this was , but I'll just wrap it up with this ; DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS "", use your money towards something you'll enjoy."
4,Faerie Tale Theatre: Princess Tales,"I enjoyed all 4 movies when I was a teen. Now I played it and it seems that my 4 children 15yr and 7yr old girls, 12yr and 11yr old boys also enjoyed them. Compared with all the new movies coming out, with all the technology available to the makers. I applaud Faerie Tale Theatre for what it had to work with. I loved all the Characters and Actors/Actresses. Love the Faerie Tale Theatre."
1,Misleading?,"I haven't heard this but it's listed here as a single CD. The ""complete royal roost"" would be like 4 disks. I don't understand."
4,"Hot Bodies, Great Action",Great for sport-minded enthusiasts. Great bodies and relaxing type of sporting action.
2,Not as much fun as I thought!,"My boys love taking baths, but this toy did not hold their interest. My 2 year old likes to play with the accessories, but not the actually toy. It also didn't stay put on the bathtub."
3,Fun Splash,This is cool my Son likes to put the water in the cup to watch the windmill spin the play cups he use to pour water on his head.
3,OK bath toy,"The best part of this toy is the fillable reservoir that drips to make the wheel go. My son loves to pour water in there. Other than that, the rest of the toy is pretty boring."
1,"Disappointing, to say the least","I do not recommend this book. Not only will it be unhelpful as a tool to mastering the topics in the MCAT, it will be a hindrance because the topics are so poorly taught. The only good it does is that it provides an accurate outline of the scope of physics topics covered on the MCAT (and that information is free on the offical MCAT homepage). The explanations are very short, often incomplete, and sometimes outright incomprehensible. This is a book clearly not written by a person who understands the physics in a meaningful enough manner to teach it effectively.Because the MCAT is knowledge based, a person is better off simply knowing the material through and through. The outline of the topics within the scope of the MCAT and a good introductory physics textbook--written by people who have devoted their lives to the study and teaching of physics, will serve you much better."
1,Don't Study with this book.,"I do not recommend this book. Not only it is poorly written, it will not give you the understanding you will need to do well on MCAT physics. This book is clearly not written by someone who REALLY understands physics. The questions at the end of each topic are way harder than the material covered and the explanation are poor and incomplete. STAY AWAY! I wish someone had told me this and had saved me time."
1,zzzzzzzzzz,"This book was bor-ring. It is supposed to be about some evil secret society, but after about fifty pages I gave up, as almost nothing had happened. This book was especially disappointing because I had just read his The Corpse in the Waxworks, written some thirty years before this one, and it was a brisk and inventive detective novel of the locked-room category for which Carr is justifiably famous."
3,Better acting than expected,"Had a decent plot that was unexpected of a film like this. Made a fair effort at a Tarantino-like story. This was made better by the hot performance of Ava Lake/Mia Zottoli(Asia), who like Kira Reed, is not only very good looking, but can act given the right storyline. Hot .... scenes make this film fun to watch, but sometimes detract the credibility of plot, but this ain't De Mille."
2,Not one of my favorites,"I've read quite a few of the Perry Mason books, and this wasn't one of his best. I like the courtroom drama, and that was shorter than usual in this book. There is some interesting interplay between Perry and Della, though. For those who have not read these books, they're a lot of fun, and Perry is quite the dashing bachelor with the dramatic flair in the courtroom that is so much fun to read."
5,vey insightful and refreshing -- must read book for anyone serious about future marrital success,"This book was the most helpful book in this topic. There are so many important pieces of advice. I came out of a rather long lasting marriage that still ended in divorce years ago. While reading his advice, I recalled all my serious long relationships including my marriage, and I wished I had read this book years ago. But, I am happy that I could find this book. I am in my mid-40's and still learning and looking for a solid wonderful marriage with my soulmate. I have been in e-Harmony, and so far I have had great experience in this service. I recommend this book highly. English is my second language, but I could read this book w/o much difficulty, too."
1,Ruined,"This book played a major part in ruining my relationship. My boyfriend started reading it and immidiately brokeup with me! I'm not saying that it's a bad book. He started reading it as if it were supossed to define a ""perfect relationship"" and as we all know there is no such thing! I will admit that it was not entirely the books fault. We both needed some work, but because of this book it made him think that it was pointless. Thanks alot."
5,"Dee Lundgren, Langhorne PA counselor","This book is a must for anyone in or contemplating a serious relationship. Dr. Warren has done the research and found what leads to lasting relationships. First, he talks about getting out of a relationship when someone lacks integrity. It makes sense that a lasting relationship is not going to be lasting if one of the partners lacks character. Dr. Warren calls these red flags. People will only like the book if they are open to hearing what research has to say and not what they necessarily want it to say."
1,Very disappointed,"I recently purchased this cookbook on a visit home, and I am very disappointed. The Amish/Mennonite women are wonderful cooks, but this book is a terrible representation of their cooking. The recipes in this book are heavily dependent on Jello, instant pudding, canned pie filling, canned soup, cake mixes, and Velveeta. Furtermore, many recipes give no pan size, cooking time, or yield.The Amish Cook:Recollections and Recipes from an Old Order Amish Family and Cooking from Quilt Country: Hearty Recipes from Amish and Mennonite Kitchens are wonderful. Buy them instead"
2,I really don't see it happening.,"So I've stuck this thing to my zapper and have seen very minimal results. It's in a small area where there are a good bit of mosquitoes, but believe me they have more interest in ME than anything else. There most be something better out there."
2,only a 15% boost,"Yeah you can tell it does attract the mosquitos...And the boost in zapper kills you get from it versus its cost only justifies getting it IF the mosquito population is very very high. If its not, then don't waste your money on it.Now what would be a better value is make one for 80 cents that only lasts three or four days. And make it a little stronger. The idea is to leave the bug zapper on for that entire time, and lure 75% of them into it. Ya know? Might be good for 12 days or so, before the population builds up again.Anyway, its not very effective, and I'd only buy it again out of desparity."
3,Not sure if it works,"With changing weather conditions and only occasional use it is difficult to determine if this product makes the bug zapper more effective. As others have reported, it was not clear that we needed a holder for the lure, but without it, it was fairly easy to tape it onto the zapper. The ""placebo effect"" gives us some satisfaction with the lure."
1,Stinger Mosquito Octenol Lure,Stinger Mosquito Octenol LureCould not find out if it works because I could not get it to fit in the bottom of the Stinger like the instructions say to do.
5,Plush & Cuddly doll,Gund makes one of the best constructed dolls out there & best of all for mothers; this doll is machine washable.I bought this doll for my Niece who just turned one. It's the perfect size for a toddler. Sonja's outfit is so soft and the body encourages little ones to snuggle up.
5,An outstanding and complete guide to a beautiful weapon.,I found Sir Ralph Payne-Gallway's review of the crowwbow to be the most complete source of information on the crossbow that I have ever found. The drawings and schematics are perfect for almost any layman to build truly awe inspiring and functional pieces of history. A must for any midevil or weapons library.
4,Maggi Chicken Noodle Soup,"Maggi Cream Of Chicken Soup Mix, 2.26-Ounce Packets (Pack of 48)Not to wild about this brand, way to salty for me, and price is way to high for dry package soups. Probably won't get no more of this"
1,not the timberland I thought I knew,I have always respected Timberland products. Not this time. This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding. There was very little to it but shell.
3,Buy a shoehorn with these boots!,"I bought these for my 2 year old little boy. The boots look great and are well made but they are REALLY difficult to get on,even with the laces completely removed. After about a dozen wearings they break in and start to go on easier, but if you are buying these for a baby or toddler, be prepared to spend an extra ten minutes putting these on your little guy for the first few weeks!"
3,HECTOR,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
4,my nephew,"speedy shipping, package arrived before estimated time of delivery.gladly do business with seller again any day of the week."
1,Nice boots however need one left and one right shoe to make a pair,Recieved two right boots. My son was never able to wear these booots since I didn't have time to return them. I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair.
5,Amusing lessons in life and death,"Edward Gorey brings an obscure children's text into the light of modern times with all new illustrations. Sure to teach your child valuable lessons in a most unconventional manner, CTFC contains short stories, in poetry form, of children being eaten by lions, dying of stomach illness, and burning to death (to name a few) because they didn't follow the sound instructions of their parents. In the same vein as The Gashlycrumb Tinies, this one is fun for children and the adult with an unusual sense of humor."
1,Kindle edition is awful,"This is a brilliant book, of course, which has been utterly destroyed by the Kindle edition. All the lines of verse have been lost and instead the text is wrapped to solid justification, which makes it terrible to read. Formatting is nonexistent; instead of italics, it uses _underscores around phrases_, which is annoying. I strongly recommend avoiding this issue."
2,No proof !!!,"Throughout the book the author discusses on the same stuff repeatedly.....as multiple parts and chapters. It is a collection of Web services articles narrates the same story of how Web services technology will impact their business strategies and organization. The author written this book exploding a business article and explored his own meaning of Web services oriented architecture.I am bit disappointed after reading the book as the contents does not make a case for a manager..... why you would ever build or use web services, what are its benefits and known issues of Web services, etc. Nevertheless, if you are looking for answers what web services really are (e.g. when to use them, etc.), this book doesn't provide those answers. Think twice before you buy...you may save your money."
5,Glad I got to watch it,"It was a beautiful tale that seemed to capture my old dynasty warrior playing days, it was pretty awesome. It takes it to a whole new level towards the end of the series."
4,Solid country Christmas music,"I picked up this cd because Honky Tonk Christmas was attributed to Duckworth - if this was the same Duckworth (William) who composed the classical Southern Harmonies, I wanted to hear what he did in the country music arena.This cd has no poor tracks - it is exactly what one expects from the upper layer of country performers. Roy Clark's instrumentals are excellent. If you like country music, you'll like this album."

4,Words like music,"Best for fans on Noon's who like him not only for Vurt, but for the way he likes to play with language and music. A bit pretentious at first, it may take a while to appreciate it's beauty. He challenges conventional notions of literture, but who hasn't? Luckily, he starts with an idea that is still original which seems to be based on his own desire to explore the bounds of language."
5,Words Like Music,"This is an experiment...Cobralingus shows you behind the secret door where Noon recreates the modern novel. It is an instruction manual, a poetry book, an art book, a short story collection, and more all in one sleek designer package.Remember, reading Jeff Noon makes you happy."
2,So-So At Best,"I am a big fan of Jeff Noon. I read & loved all of his past works that I could get my hands on. This however, is a book lacking...It is impossible to read! Perhaps I missed the first book in this series, but his literature is just a bunch of jiberous that he ""ran through the cobralingus"" word engine or something. It reminds me a lot of E.E Cummings, only harder to understand than even that. I'm being generous by giving him two stars, but truthfully, I think he should stick with stories from now on."
3,Billy's Bootcamp Fat Burners,Good video if Billy would just shut his mouth. He talks too much during the video and it's annoying!!! But the exercises are good.
5,Peace Love & Music 2 cd's,The album has all the 60's hard rock songs...original recordings...This 2 cd set has vol. 1 & vol. 3 from a 5 cd collection...Buy it its grate...
4,poor but beautiful Cuba!,"I have to say that I haven't been to Cuba but I will definetely visit one day. By watching this movie you'll know how primitive, how original, how poor and also how beautiful, how friendly, how much the Cuban people cherish their land, their lives. This is one of my favorite movies so far and you should watch it and own it as well.:)"
4,Guantanamera,"I liked this movie. Althought, it wasn't as funny as Un rey en La Habana but, is a comedy-drama that cuban citizens face everyday. The adversity and stupidy of the system in everyday life. I recommend it very much."
2,pages missing,"The research and content of this book were good but there were errors in the binding. Pages 20 through 52 were missing, then pages 53 t0 83 repeated. I thought about asking for a refund or at least a new book but decided it just wasn't worth the effort."
4,Fantatsic gift,"My dad is very happy with it, the condition was good so he is satisfied & I am happy it arrived before Father's day."
4,Great Look at Trial Strategy,"This book is a great read for anyone that wonders what happened before, during and after the street fight on Fremont Street. The author does a great job looking at the strategy of both the prosecution and the defense and how both make an all or nothing effort to win ""justice"".It certainly will not quiet those that think the Earp's got away with murder nor does it completely vindicate their actions. It does give some insite into the proceedings and how if not for a small thing here or there, history would remember the events in Tombstone quite differently."
3,Not her best,"I have read all of Barbara Pym's published works and I find that this is one of her weaker offerings. In this book she leaves her spinsters and has a married woman with a child for her heroine. She doesn't seem comfortable with this heroine. The scenes with the child are a little stilted. She doesn't seem as real or as interesting as Mildred of ""Excellent Women"" or even Wilmet of ""A Glass of Blessings"" her other married heroine. But, as a fan I enjoyed the book. It was interesting to see her outside her usual cast of characters. There are some really good parts, especially those dealing with the academics where she is on familiar ground."
4,...a quick and entertaining read...,"Good night, maman is a definately worth reading. It goes through and shows the relationship between two children, Karin and Marc, and their Maman during WWII 1940. But during the stress of these events in history, the three come upon twists and turns leading to freedom. This book is good for all ages and is a quick and entertaining read."
5,Good Night Maman,"This book is about two Jewish kids, Karin and Mark, who escape to America. THey thought they were going there to be free, but they soon find out that they're being put behind a fence. Karin soon makes friends, is able to go to school, and...... I'm not going to tell you. You'll just have to read the book to find out! I recommend this book to anyone because it was so excellent!"
