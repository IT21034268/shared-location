3,Okay in general,"When it arrived, one of the straps on the pedal was broken. Apparently, it had not been packaged securely enough because this should not have happened. Whomever is responsible for shipping out merchandise at Amazon needs to be aware of this and take care to see that products that are paid for will arrive in the best condition possible. In the meantime, I will need to glue the strap so that it does not come undone. Otherwise, it can't be used. I hope that this is not typical of Amazon's products because otherwise I won't be ordering any other items out of concern for the quality of the product."
4,pedal in my chair,I am using this for health issues to build up energy in my legs. It is light weight enough to move easily It does seem to move some when in use. Ihad to replace a clip on one of the pedal arms
1,disappointed,"Never received ordered item. Was sent a different, less expensive one and rejected it. After much hassling about the mistake finally was refunded purchase price. Still need the medically recommended item so will have to find another source. Very disappointed."
4,Good item but with some quirks.,"The screen needs to have more room for so that the seconds, date, day, alarm, and max and min indoor temp and humidity can be seen all at once. An extra inch or two of screen would fix that, or reducing the size of the large weather expectation display.The barometer history is also constantly flashing/scrolling every couple seconds, which, according to the manual is to avoid lcd burn in. Funny how other parts of the screen can be lit up for up to several months at a time without suffering burn in."
4,"A little tricky to set up, but worth it.","Full of features, and most attractive. It took me numerous attempts to get the remote sensor to communicate with the station. In my frustration, I contacted the manufacturer via email, which was answered within a day, and my problem was ultimately solved with their help. Recommended item and company."
5,Works and Looks Great,"We were on vacation in Florida and this was in the condo where we stayed. We loved it so much that when we got home to Ohio, we bought one for us and another for a gift to my mother-in-law. We ALL love it. It looks wonderful in our kitchen with the stainless steel appliances."
4,Outstanding Photos,"This book had some of the best pictures I have seen of Scottish Folds. The text was informative and educational but it is the photos which catch your eye. They are done with a high gloss finish and are really beautiful. The book contains information on basic care only and touches only lightly on some topics.If you are seriously interested in the Scottish Fold, cat there are other books which would provide more information, however, if you just want to admire the beauty of the breed, I highly recommend this book. In paperback, it is not expensive and the photos are as nice as the hardcover version."
2,Mostly generic cat info,"As other reviewers have noted, this book has lovely pictures of scottish fold kitties. However, most of the text is general information on cat care. (Grooming, feeding, vet care, showing, etc.)What I was hoping for was information on how to find these rather rare cats, how much to expect to pay, and how, if any, their care differs from other cats. There was precious little of that."
2,Scottish Fold book,"I ordered this book on Dec. 20 and received it on Jan. 14. Much too long. The book was advertised as Like New - Very good. However, It had magic marker streaks on it, the pages were stuck together, the corners bent. The book smelled like an old book. It was certainly readable but I was very disappointed. This was NOT a hardback. This book was not advertised properly."
4,Scottish Fold reading,"This us a nice little book to provide information regarding the breed of kitty, named a Scottish Fold. These little ones are loveable and adorable. They are bright and loving in return. The book provides some insight, and I would recommend it to anyone who has a SF kitten."
1,Book was filled with highlights,I was not happy to receive my book and find it filled with highlights and pen notes on the pages. The ad said the book was in very good shape and was fulfilled by Amazon so I was surprised. None of my other purchases of used text books with that same rating arrived with any writing in them
5,pure pleasure,"In the midst of winter Elisa Kleven's Sun Bread brought my eight-year old son and I pure pleasure, warmth and joy. We stayed on each page much longer than it took to read the dancing words, just to study all the happenings amongst the animals in this diversely populated town. Early on, each window, each character revealed the effects of an incessent grey winter, yet we eagerly turned the pages in anticipation of what might follow. Elisa's exquisite, remarkably intricate illustrations, eloquent and flowing verse, and creative baker dog prove that while external factors may be difficult, we can always create our own happpiness, warmth and sun. All ages will love this book at their own level."
4,Lovely!,"This is a delightful book with gorgeous pictures, pleasing rhymes to read aloud and several lovely themes that are nicely understated (e.g. the pleasure of giving and receiving, creating your own light and warmth in dark and wintry times). The illustrations are warm without being too shmaltzy and have the kind of details that young kids (perhaps all kids) love, where you can pick out a tiny lion in this corner doing such and so and, ""What's that?! A zebra doing...!"" I haven't yet tried the recipe for sun bread on the back cover but what a great idea idea to be able to leap up from the book into your kitchen with your toddler to bake up some bread."
2,Buy the original albums!,"I mostly agree with the previous reviewer but would consider 'Remain In Light' to be the band's artistic peak. This compilation truly is a poor representation of the Talking Heads' oeuvre. Off the first four albums (IMHO their best) only four songs are included here, one of them as a live version. Do yourself a favour and obtain the original albums. If you must buy a compilation, get 'Popular Favorites 1976-1992/Sand In the Vaseline'."
2,vASTLEY INFERIORER,There are much better comps out there- even the new audio cd of stop makeing sense is better. After speaking in tounges they went downhill and this disc has mostly that material.
3,"motorcycle gloves, not ideal","I bought these gloves to wear while I was on my motorcycle. I like them, but they left my hands red for the first 2 weeks. they stretched quite a bit, and they havn't been as durable as I would like. I have used them for about 4 months and I'll have to get a new pair soon."
4,Miami Rhapsody,"The photography in this book is stunning. The reader gets to see in these arial photos places one could never see on the ground. If you are a lover of Miami or just enjoy great photography, you will not regret purchasing this book. Be forewarned that this book is a bit dated, but you will still really get the feel of Miami and south Florida."
5,Excellent DVD on the Amazon,"I bought this DVD prior to traveling to the Amazon Basin - mainly to the Rio Negro. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it before my trip. It helped me to better understand what to expect, what I might see, etc. I enjoyed it even more afterwards, as I found myself watching it again and again after returning home. It is very accurate and real. It portray's what you will really see on the Rio Negro and what the Amazon region is really like. It highlights things perfectly. I only wish it was longer or there was another one. I loved it!"
5,At Last!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"After seeing Starcastle live at the age of 18, as an opening act for ELO at Connecticut's Hartford Civic Center in 1977 I was hooked. I purchased every album and tape (for the car) as soon as they were released. I've since worn out the LP's as well as the tapes and have not been able to find them anywhere. At last after 8 years I will be able to get all of their music once again on CD. I am looking forward to being able to listen to one of the pre-eminent progressive rock bands that the US has ever produced."
2,You've gotta be kidding,"This album is so hopelessly derivative of YES that it's a joke. I just listened to Lady of the Lake and heard imitations of Steve Howe guitar style, Jon Anderson's vocal pitch, Chris Squire's entire bass guitar thing, plus direct ripoffs of everything from Roundabout's ending coda, direct lifts from Mussorgsky (as noted, apparently without irony, unfortunately by another reviewer), and guitar riffs right out of YES's Perpetual Change. Starcastle lacks the depth and density of composition that YES pioneered. Sounds pretty, but so does Kelly Clarkson."
1,This isn't prog rock.,"Starcastle may have been inspired by Yes, but they lack all of the complexity that Yes has to offer. I would say that this album is more akin to The 5th Dimension than Yes, but a million times more poppy, and it isn't even good pop. It's misleading to call this prog, as it clearly is not."
1,"Excuses, excuses, excuses...","-No question these guys are an imitator band. Ya know, the kind you see who go around and call themselves something slightly different but are really clones of what they consider to be the 'sincerest form of flattery'. But that only works if they're honest about it.Unfortunately, Starcastle never was.They were lucky enough to land a big record contract with Columbia at a time when Walter Yetnikoff wanted something to appeal to Yes-heads and prog dinosaurs who couldn't admit the music was five years past it's prime.Give this one a pass, unless you're into faux Yes._"
1,I've seen them live...at my High School!!!,"Yes, believe it or not, Starcastle did a dance gig in my High School(John Vianney H.S., St. Louis, MO) gymnasium back in ~1976 featuring one of the first (former)lead singers of REO Speedwagon. They rocked the house!! Very good band, and very good CD."
4,"Achtung, Yes fans!!!","They may say Starcastle were just another yes-wannabees, but truth being that thought they were not near the real Mc Coy, these guy ruled, just listen to Elliptical Seasons in this album, this song in partircular conveys the exhilarating joy of most Yes`songs verse. Definitely recommended to Yes fans."
4,easier to enjoy now than at the time of its release,"Starcastle was too close to the edge of Yes back in the prog-saturated 70's; nowadays, they are a fine addition to the playlist of any Yes fan. Starcastle sound great and, as it's now twenty years later, they've got nothing left to prove. We can feel free to enjoy their lush, symphonic rock free of copycat-supporter guilt. In 1999, all that's left is the music, and I think it's remarkably adept, if derivative, prog-rock. Having said that, I haven't heard 'reel-to-reel' and my copy of 'citadel' doesn't visit the turntable too often... there's something faintly disco about 'citadel' that i've heard is exhibited in full cry on 'reel to reel'."
4,wonderful first effort!,I would much rather review the second and third releases but since they are not available on disc ( I cant seem to find a copy- help!) i would ask anyone to check out a canadian band called the code> HOT!
4,The best album Yes never made,"An enjoyable walk through 70s prog. These guys are obviously talented, and have some great ideas, but let's be realistic. They ... Yes so much it's shameless. From bass sounds, to moog and mellotron and hammond, to Luttrell's voice, it's bordering on plagiarism.Seriously, if you heard ""Elliptical Seasons"" out of context, not knowing who it was, you'd swear it was a long-lost Yes song, or something from a Jon Anderson solo album.Still, this is a fun recording, and enjoyable to listen to. Worth getting, so check it out!"
3,is it Yes?,"while i do not own this one - I remember years ago, they sounded like a Yes clone. That bass, that voice, etc etc, I just could not swallow it..."
5,Works well,I bought this to replace the 150k old one in my wife's Corolla. It is no where near as beefy as the stock one but I still fell better having this in the car than one that was so old/used.
5,Impressive!,"The kids go to camp. At campfire, they talk about vampires then Vampires started to appear in the camp."
5,Kavli is wheat free and I love it!,"I eat Kavli crackers every day - they're high fiber and low calorie, and they are wheat free - I'm allergic to wheat so this is very important to me. I order them by the case!"
3,Nutrition info update,"The nutrition info given online does not match that on the box when the product arrived. According to the box total fat = .5 g, sodium = 40 mg, total carbs = 12g, fiber = 4g (not 7g), protein = 2g."
4,ALMOST perfect,"ROCKY HORROR 2000.. this album features some of Broadway's best. With talent the likes of ALICE RIPLEY, RAUL ESPARZA, DAPHNE RUBUN VEGA, JARROD EMICK, and TOM HEWITT, who could go wrong? The show is indescribably amazing in the theatre, and perhaps that is the only problem with the cd. Each performer holds their own, but the recorded version of ROCKY HORROR LIVE doesn't have the same energy. Of course it is a wonderful addtion for any ROCKY HORROR LIVE fan or any fan of the amazing performers, but if you are looking to duplicate the experience, its not quite there."
3,Oh Daphne!,"Most of the reviews have it right here - this production wasn't really Rocky at it's best. That being said, I must say that Daphne Ruben-Vega as magenta is probably one of the most interesting, refreshing, and note worthy things about this recording. Very cool in that regard.That's All..."
5,One of my favorite cast recordings,"This was the first Rocky Horror album I've ever listened to besides the movie soundtrack. Despite the lack of Joan Jett as Columbia and the 2nd Usherette, this album is sweet. Daphne-Rubin Vega is perfect as Magenta. And Tom Hewlett 's interpretation as Frank N. Furter is just in sync with the character. But he's still no Tim Curry. And the rest of the cast is sublime. And with Dick Cavett as the Criminologist and famed lesbian comedienne Lea DeLaria as both Eddie and Dr. Scott is just excellent."
2,Who did this?,"I love this show, and see it often. Sadly, Raul Esparaza is no longer playing Riff-Raff, so I picked up this album. It's just bad. It was recorded in a studio (and not a good one), so the energy is muted compared to the live show. This recording sounds like the actors rehersing after a week off.Now, the album is still good. But it is a shadow of what they do on stage."
1,Horrible!,"While filled with talented performers, this cd sucks.Rocky is a campy, 1970's B-Movie, that's what makes it enjoyable. Even as a stage show it's a hokey, rock-and-roll extravaganza.This cd tries to turn Rocky into Thoroughly Modern Millie, and it just doesn't work. The corny sci-fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make Rocky..Rocky. This cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original Roxy cast.And lastly, Tim Curry is Frank. His rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the Frank on this album. Ripley is a little too legit for Janet, and the female Eddie weirds me out.Buy the Roxy cast. It's so superior it's almost laughable."
5,Perfect!,"I was looking for this item, and I was pleased to not only find it on Amazon.com, but for it to be CRAZY-cheaper than iTunes. This seller set a great price, and I couldn't believe how fast it got to me -- and in great condition. Thank you!"
3,Fun but not great,"Good recording of a very fun show, but some of the cast (Daphne Rubin-Vega & Lea DeLaria) are a bit annoying in their roles"
2,It's OK,"The actors sing pretty good, but it all seems emotionless and dull to me. Lea Delaria and Daphne Rubin-Vega have the best voices and add something new though. The guy playing Frank? I know Rocky Horror is a spoof, but his performance was so bad.Hearing these songs live on stage was great, because you have the visuals (and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Magenta!!), but it's a chore for me to listen to this CD. The music has horrible arrangements. I prefer the Roxy cast to this one. And I'm in the minority, but I even like the original London cast better. At least they had some personality."
5,Wow!,"This album is just amazing. You can just feel the energy. When listening to ""Time Warp"", I couldn't help myself! I HAD to dance. ""Sweet Transvestite"" is pretty good, though not as good as how Tim Curry sings it. ""Damn It, Janet"" is good here. Jarrod Emmich(did I get his name right?) is amazing, especially when he hits his high notes.""Hot Patootie"" and ""Eddie's Teddy"" is hilarious because it's a woman singing as Eddie and Dr. Scott. Now, you might think it's weird I think that because, a man is Frank. But, Frank is a transvestite. But, Eddie and Dr. Scott are male characters. Anyways... =P""Over at the Frankenstein Place"" is pretty good too. ""Floor Show/Rose Tint My World"" is awesome. ""SF/DF"" and ""SF/DF(reprise)"" is great, along with ""I Can Make You A Man"" and ""I Can Make You A Man(reprise)"".Well, come to think of it, there really isn't a bad track on this CD.I highly recommend this album. Not just to Rocky Horror Show fans, but to anyone."
2,Is it Grease?,"I feel that this recording goes for broke. It tries to make everything a slick production number with too many added background parts. It begins to sound as if the ""audience participation"" the show has come to know was integrated into the music for this revival. As someone who has read the original stage show script and the re-vamped script for this production I can say that they did this as well in the script - taking away some of the flow and charm of the original.What is nice about the original cast recordings - especially the Roxy Cast - is that is was a rock and roll show with the emphasis on the music and not the slick production.If you want a true rocked up version of The Rocky Horror Show that gives the music a sound for today - try The Rocky Horror Punk Rock Show."
3,Rock ON AND ON!!!!!,"This revival is not as good as the original but the opening is SUPER> The overture, hard rock, and cheer are a great opening for the show. We used this when we did Rocky last year. The audience LOVED it."
4,More Visions from Joyner,"""Visions of the Harvest"" is a book of ""three prophetic visions and a Spirit-inspired allegory"" that augments Rick Joyner's other books of prophecy. This book includes four sections which address different specific spiritual issues including christian unity, economic disaster, spiritual warfare and the enemy's attack on the church, and an allegory called ""Escape from Christendom"" by Robert Burnell.Although ""Visions of the Harvest"" did not have the broad scope of Rick Joyner's better known ""The Final Quest,"" this work did address some specific issues that deserve attention and consideration.If you are interested in what God is saying to today's prophets, begin with Joyner's ""The Final Quest,"" and move through his books. ""Visions of the Harvest"" is exactly what the title calls it -- glimpses into what the future may hold and what our responsibility is in the future."
4,calling,"Great 50 day devotional that will strengthen your inner man. God wants us to have a sure and strong foundation. The foundation is in Christ Jesus and His word. God wants us to know the truth, and that is found in the word."
2,&#65533;Greatest Hits&#65533; Being A Relative Term,"Why anyone would need an anthology of Argent is beyond me. I suppose it may have some nostalgia appeal, but the band is basically schlock prog. `Liar' is the only track that is tolerable, but I would stick to the Three Dog Night Version, as for `Time Of The Season', this version is a butchery."
2,"A great band, but a lousy compilation...","Argent were a strange band, in general: while they started out being HEAVILY melodic and Zombie-esque, Rod and Russ slowly started to move in a more progressive direction after their debut. Sadly, this (surprisingly short) collection is mostly of that later period; indeed, most of the Argent songs known by anybody (Hold Your Head Up, God Gave...) aren't really indicative of what they could DO. I suggest passing this up, and instead picking up their first two albums (Argent/Ring of Hands); trust me, if you dismissed them after hearing this, you'll be more than pleasently surprised."
3,Anthology: The Best of Argent,"Yes, this is a skimpy collection but I wasn't an Argent fan; so, basically, this just about fits my needs for Argent. It could stand a remastering job & some bonus tracks could be added. With that being said, I'll mention the best songs here: ""Hold Your Head Up"" (Argent's most famous song), ""Liar"" (they wrote it) & ""God Gave Rock and Roll to You"". There's a live version of ""Time of the Season"" written by Rod Argent when he was a member of the Zombies. You know how live versions of songs go: they change it around & add solos; I'd rather hear the original. There aren't any liner notes & the only place they have put writer credits is on the disc. Tell me, isn't there a better ""Best of"" for this group?"
1,Hold Your Head Down,"This has to be one of the skimpiest compilations ever made. Based on the success of Rod and companies biggest hit ""Hold Your Head Up"" the rest of the cuts are mediocre at best. Hold out for Three Dog Night's version of ""Liar"" , the Kiss version of ""God Gave Rock and Roll to You"" and anyone else's version of ""Time of the Season"". Its amazing that the Zombies classic with Rod playing on it can be messed up so badly. So much for inovation. I wonder if Colin Blunstone gave his ok for it. I think not."
4,A Brief Review,"Its a shame no one has reviewed this book before now. I clicked onto Amazon.com to see if John Wengle had written any other books after Ethnographers in the Field, only to find that this interesting book had never been reviewed, at least not here.I read the book while engaged in anthropological fieldwork myself, not as a novice or a Ph.D student, but as a veteran medical anthropologist who had done a lot of fieldwork in several countries. Yet at the time, I was stilll experiencing stress, loneliness, a degree of culture and language shock, and all the rest of the feelings and psycological states described by Wengle.Etrhnographers in the Field is well-researched and written, and ought to be of continuing interest to anthropologists, Peace Corps volunteers, and others living in cultures markedly different from their own. I recommend it.Edward C. Green, Ph.D egreendc@aol.com"
1,Author has an ax to grind.,850 pages of rather dull and uninformative prose; does anadequate job of critiquing the novels but give short shriftto the poetry. Unrelenting harangue against the second Mrs.Hardy.
1,if you love these songs do not buy this album,"I love music. I love the original recordings of these songs. I thought this would be by the original artists, it isn't. It is boring lounge lizard versions, they suck. Do not make my mistake. Do not buy this."
2,Disappointing,"Sort of a ho-hum collection of songs, and many of your familiar favorites are cover versions."
1,DO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY!,"This interface is garbage, bad drivers, not recognized a lot of times, MIDI ports do not work and M-AUDIO simply said, ""oh, yes, it is true, MIDI has some problems"". I need to sold it for buying some interface but USB 2.0, not this piece of garbage. Buy ROLAND, MOTU, or other, M-AUDIO it is not synonym of quality."
2,Difficult to Follow,"I have had this deck for a long time, but have never used it much. I purchased the book because my plan was to try to integrate Tarot and Qabala as my practice for this year. The chapters are set up according to the paths on the Qabalistic Tree of Life, but there is no diagram in the front of the book to refer to - I found myself constantly looking for a diagram to reference. I beleive there was one buried in the back somewhere, but is was definitely not easy to find. I also had difficulties with her premise that Wands represent Air and Swords Fire. After working with the book and the deck for less than a month; I decided to go back to the Osho Zen Deck that I studied last year."
1,witches ta,I was very disappointed with the witches tarot as they are advertized as boarderless and even though I was reasurred that they were boarderless unfortunately they have big black boarders around each card. As a professional tarot reader this stops the flow for me. The original cards in a yellow box were boarderless but the ones in the red or blue boxes are not.
1,Too Much and Not Enough,"This is the first book I read of this author because the story line seemed interesting. I should have started with Greenwood's earlier books because this one is terrible. It reads as if the author dictated the story and the result was never edited. Way too much exposition, and he told me everything as if I had the brain of a pea. It's so much better if a writer takes me where he wants me to go instead of just telling me what's going on.On the advice of a friend of mine, I tried this author again with the first book in his ""Seven Brides"" series called Rose. It was infinitely better, tighter written, and quite enjoyable. Greenwood still told me more things than he needed to, but I forgave him for that a little bit. It just seems to be his way to dumb things down occasionally.Don't waste your money on this book, buy the brides' books instead."
4,Leigh Greenwood's - Chet,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series of western/romance genre with some historical facts included... I'd have preferred to read the books in sequence, but it wasn't too troublesome as long as you begin with ""Jake"". The writing is simple, and seems to reflect simpler times... I liked the historical references to the times and that area of the country."
2,The dialogue is terrible especially in the first half.,Leigh Greenwood is slipping in her dialogue as she moves further and further from the original series. The interchanges between Melody and her stepmother are insipide after the first episode and they seem to go on forever. Leigh has the potential to be an outstanding romance writer right up there with Norah Roberts but she needs to improve the meat of her stories.
5,the Master,"How can you not like Leonard Cohen, really? Nice collection of songs, rounds out my CD stash nicely and I'll get many hours out of it."
4,The Best of Leonard Cohen -CD audio,"Being a serious L. Cohen fan, this is a stellar collection of earlier work. In my opinion, some of his best! Not ever known for his vocal chops, lyrics that are insightful, provocative, intelligent, with arrangements that showcase his lyrics, I prefer this to the current drone of insidious hip-hop and rap rantings."
4,"""The Best of Leonard Cohen"", what else do you need to know?","Best of is an adequate representation of the early career of the seminal folk poet guru, Leonard Cohen. All of the ""must-have"" songs from this period are included - particularly of note are the masterpieces Suzanne and Bird On The Wire. However, those are far from the only classic songs here. Seminal intimate, poetic songs such as So Long, Marianne, Famous Blue Raincoat, and Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye are included. This is an excellent starting place for the fan new to Cohen, and the ideal companion to his latter-day More Best Of. One of the more nicely refined and ideal ""best of"" albums you're likely to come across."
3,"This CD was almost identical to 'The Essential Leonard Cohen"".","This CD is almost a carbon copy of the other Leonard Cohen CD I bought. I woldn't have bought it if I had been given that information. However there didn't see to be any way I could find the list of songs on this CD. It's true ""The Essential LC"" had one or two more songs than this one, but they were precisely the songs compromised by the defect in that CD. Neither CD was satisfactory."
3,Sorry...just can't get used to that voice,"Maybe it's because I first heard ""Suzanne"" sung by Judy Collins, and then another brilliant version by a little-known artist named Alisa (on Radio Tokyo Tapes Vol. 3), before I heard Cohen's original version. Anyway, I just can't help thinking that Cohen is a lot better as a songwriter than a performer. I just can't get used to him as a vocalist -- I think for the obvious reason: The guy can't sing worth a nickel."
2,Sad,"I will be brief. No coments on the songs, thay are as great as on the original albums they came from.But who made the selection? The easiest way to demolish the efect of a great talent- make ""The Best of"" CD"
2,Hmm,"Didn't find this CD good. When you buy a ""The best of"" CD you expect to get a bunch of good songs but on this one there is only one (the first track).That's at least what I think"
5,Am I wierd??,"I've been hearing snippets of Cohen's music for 20 years. Never got interested enough to make the effort to find out who I was listening to, but was always intrigued. Finally, this summer my 19-year-old-niece-who-knows-everything-in-the-world told me immediately that Leonard Cohen sang the song I was humming (""Suzanne""). I got ""The Best of"" and have enjoyed it immensely. Lyrics, harmonies, melodies, accompanyments, backup singers, LC's voice -- everything unbelievably creative and musical. But no one I know (I'm 54) agrees with me!"
5,WOW! You are lucky if you haven't listen to this yet!,"...because this is the man!!! I bought this and I knew not much about him but man, he is good. Try it and I promise that you won't regret it!"
5,"If you care about lyrics, buy this CD","Anyone who wants to write songs should get this album. The music and singing are also very nice. I do listen to this album for hours on end, day after day. And I am not a Leonard Cohen nut. I could make a list of suggestions for improving his lyrics, but that's pointless. He is definitely a standard to measure song writing."
4,Surprising,"My sarcastic and slightly dry schoolteacher lent me this saying ""the main thing are his lyrics, not the music"" SO I went home a little sceptical, but ready for some lyrical challenge. I listened for a while, listened to the tune first. I play guitar so I could make out some of the simpler chords and tricks used by guitarists which don't work very well. I then resigned myself to listening to his lyrics. Sure enough my teacher was right. In ""bird on a wire"" Cohen drew me into the song, his mellow, dull and poignant background music almost drawing me to tears. And to top it all I had been conditioned from the first 3 tracks to listen to the lyrics rather than the tune, making his pain unbearable. However, I loved it, Excellent sonwriting, and my type of music. I'm also a Bob Dylan fan, and cohen's music is quite similar - low wispy voice, moving lyrics etc. I haven't bought any of his stuff yet, but I'm downloading first we take manhattan (hope it's good).Thanael."
5,Eureka SeveN rocks my socks!!,"Wow, this anime is just amazing, its incredible. I cant say anything else, everythings been said already, but yeah, I highly recommend this anime, Im on episode 39, and it just keeps getting better and better, although there are only 50 episodes, i enjoy it very much, and you should too, watch the anime in japanese though, i think the voiceovers suck big time.Well thats what i think, BUT WATCH THE ANIME!!( Renton and Eureka are awesome!) ^_^- Steff"
4,A gitft for a relative,"This was a gift for a young relative who lived and breathed Eureka. Until her visit with us, we had no idea of this genre of video, yet the teenagers at school whom I work with had heard of it and loved it. The collector sets, book, shirt and video, we got for her where her favorite acquistions;they even got the honor of laying in the bed next to her. I gather this show has a great story line, and the drawings were fabulous. She enjoyed the book, for several days, rereading and drawing the characters. Even the local asian video store here, Toys and Joys, didn't not and could not obtain it. Amazon, had it shipped and to us in less than a week. Thanks Amazon .. you made someone really happy."
3,analog rules,"I was very lucky to have picked up a vinyl pressing of this record and would highly recommend that if you can to do so. A friend of mine played me the cd and it's missing something. Albini does such wonderful things with microphones that I felt as though the band were playing in my living room. Hopefully someone will put out the singles ""Uranus"" and ""The Rude Gesture"". 5 star ratings all around."
3,Before they wore out their welcome....,"3 1/2The influential mega-producer whose own musical projects were almost always more important from a stylistic and production angle rather then a compositional one had most success with Shellac's first major release for several reasons. Primarily though it remains the tightest and least pretentious offering from the awkward front-man due to a concentrated focus on the minimal dynamics, showcasing the band at their tense-filled best. Of course, a majority of these ""exercises"" are not able to transcend the confines of their repetitious calculations, which at the time sounded no less then innovative. Still, Albini and company are far less interested in trying to break the mold then they are simply breaking it, which leads to a less strained record. Sadly the unique mechanics introduced by the trio did not seem to evolve much past their first outing, reiterating the case for At Action Park to be your one Shellac purchase."
3,"good, but may be a tad overrated","It's a pretty good album, however, i must be missing something. From what I've heard from people, Shellac is good, real good. And other people say its genius. So I went and bought At Action Park, and took it home. I enjoyed the little picture of the park and the essay on rescusitating a man who's been electrocuted, but when I put in the album, I noticed something that wasn't quite so rescusitating....repetition. Perhaps I have not given it enough time to grow. Perhaps I haven't listened to it loud enough. Perhaps it's just that the album is only o-k. Whatever the case is, the album is worth giving a shot, but in my opinion, not for getting too worked up about."
1,at action park,"tis the best one star album ever. you may spank me or call me, both if you like, but just don't spank me while i'm on the phone... it's distracting. subtle moves and genuine grooves, this c.d. will have you shellacking till you hurt your knuckles (if you no what I mean) and you can't stop once you've started. believe me: one star is where its at. bust a gut and scrap your strut, hit it up!!"
1,Absolutely wretched,The book was just sad and pathetic . Lonely repetitive mopings of someone using an obsession to fill a lonely and pointless life. There is nothing much here besides a plea for psychiatric help. Just awful. Gushings from the the worst kind of fan - illiterate and ungifted.
4,Good tasting and satisfying bar,"These bars (only the blueberry cheesecake) are part of my weight loss, muscle building regimen. I found these to consistently taste good and I did not get tired of eating them like I have with some other brands of protein bars. Compared to my next favorite bar, they had lower calories and sodium but also about 10 grams less of protein. Still they made up a substantial portion of my diet. They are lower-priced here at Amazon than at the grocery store I shop in. These are worth giving a try."
1,"The Holland House presents ""On location in Lone Pine""","This book was a big disappointment. I bought it because I thought it would tell a lot about the western movies made there. The photos were of poor quality and hard to make out in many cases. It was hard to discern who the people were in some photos. There were no color photos. Most of the book focused not on western movies, but Gunga Din, Charge of the Light Brigade, etc. I wish I hadn't bought it."
1,Pure junk,"This recommended Bubble Juice is junk. I returned 2 bubble machines, thinking it was the machine, because they would not hardly blow any bubbles. Finally on the 3rd one,after trying the Bubble Juice that didn't work, I tried cheap bubble liquid from Walmart and the machine made hundreds of bubbles. I would not recommend this to anyone. I feel cheated because I bought $18.00 worth of thin slightly soapy Water."
5,Battersea is the pinnacle of literary perfection,"This book in the Wolves/Dido series is probably amoung the best. It would be because of A.outstanding characterization B.amusing dialogue C.beautiful British humour. While The Wolves of Willoughby Chase and Nightbirds on Nantucket are both worthy of accolades, Blackhearts in Battersea is the funniest. As most Scottish readers would know, in real history Bonnie Prince Charlie tried to wrest the throne from the Georgians. Aiken's use of twisted history is superbly amusing. Also, the large pair of trousers cracks me up. My only complaint is that Sophie was too perfect and not enough human."
4,A wonderful adventure,"This is a wonderful adventure with the sense of fun that The Littles shares. It has the character of a Dickens tale and an innocent charm beyond that. My eleven-year-old loved it! He couldn't put it down and would rate it a 5 star book. The twists and turns in plot are a bit predictable for an adult, but are pure excitement for a child. The charm of it makes it pleasant reading for all ages."
2,not worth the effort,"I saw this book when I was a child and wanted to read it then (it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp/airship on it). Unfortunately, life intervened and I only got around to reading it just recently.Alas! This book was a lot better and more wonder-filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be.The story is not very interesting, the setting is not well-painted, the protagonist's adventures are pedestrian, and the whole thing is swiss-cheesed with so much British slang as will likely put an American kid off his feed.Skip this one."
5,The Emperor's Egg is Great,My 3 year old son and I have really enjoyed this book. He loves learning about penguins and is especially facinated with the baby chick. He knows this one inside and out. Since the content is nonfiction I do not mind when he asks me to read it again and again.
4,Daddies are important,"A picture book written in a casual, conversational style about Emperor penguins, and the father's role in incubating and hatching an egg. Cute and factual, but a bit too ""chatty"" for me. Will be enjoyed by 3-7 year-olds."
5,Love It!,"This was given to my son when he was 2 years old and both of us loved it from our first read/listen. He's almost 4 now and we still love it. It's extremely well written, informative, tells an amazing story and is very funny! Highly recommended, especially the audiobook which really brings out the humor!"
3,You can pluck ideas all over,"The often-cited underground heroes Slint are a bit overrated to put it lightly, but no less important for it from a production aesthetic vantage. Already with this intriguing, garage-y debut, the band's short-lived sound, from this more playful but equally experimental angle, sounds instantly recognizable, debuting as something of the missing link between Primus and Police. The problem is that, despite obvious and often bursts of brilliance, a fragmented nature gets the best of these songs and contributes to its distance."
3,"Groundbreaking, but not earthshaking","Slint basically created Post-rock in the early 90's, but I wouldn't say they perfected it. This is a good album, but not a great one. If you are a fan of Tortoise, Mogwai, Trans Am, Godspeed You Black Emporer and the like, you will find it pleasing, but not quite as good."
4,Mature themes for young adults,"This is a series well worth reading, for young and old. I wouldn't recommend it to Bible-thumpers, as the themes are likely to not sit well with extreme beliefs. It is very well-written, and the series is one of the most original I have read."
5,Hilarious,"This is funny, and my whole family spent two hours laughing our heads off. It is the show minus the commercials, so what would have made this DVD better would be that it have the skits just non stop instead of having it be apparent that a commercial break went there. Still it is well worth the money"
4,A Skimpy Collection From Their Good (Early) Years,"Dr. Hook made a series of very enjoyable albums in the early 70s, mostly featuring the wild, wacky songs of Shel Silverstein. (""Cover Of The Rolling Stone"", ""Roland The Roadie And Gertrude The Groupie"", etc.) Then, they changed. It was a terrible thing to behold, as they sold out with a string of sickly sweet sappy ballads (""When You're In Love With A Beautiful Woman"", ""Sexy Eyes"", etc.) and disco BS. Most of the Dr. Hook compilations include songs from both periods, with more from the later period, when they had more success on the charts. Frankly, I don't want any of that later stuff polluting my music collection. This is the only best-of collection that focuses exclusively on the early recordings. Unfortunately, with only 10 songs, it barely scratches the surface. I'd love to see a much more comprehensive collection of early recordings, before they sold their souls to the devil for a few top 40 hits."
3,Where is this great album?????,"For some of you who have written reviews below, Belly Up was THE best Dr Hook album (IMHO). It wasn't quite as raw as Sloppy Seconds but they hadn't sold out and gone commercial. ALSO - the original LP came with a 45 of Dennis and Ray interviewing each other - it was unbelievably funny.The best songs on the album were Roland the Roadie, The Wonderful Soupstone and The Ballad of... The first was just fun, the latter two probably having the best group harmonies that the guys ever recorded. Not near as ""snivelin'"" as some of the other songs on the other albums (Kiss it away, Carry me Carrie, etc). Right up there with The Ballad of Lucy Jordan, one of my all-time favorites.If they ever release Belly Up, buy it!!!!! You won't be sorry."
4,"Dr. Hook ""Revisited"" ""10 Great Hits""!!!! CD","This is a great ""greatest hits"" collection from Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show. The songs are as follows:1.Sylvia's Mother2.Acappulco Goldie3.Freskin' at the Freaker's Ball4.Makin' it Natural5 Penicillin Penny6.COVER OF THE ROLLING STONE (I have this issue from March, 1973!!!!!)7.Get my Rocks Off8.Carry Me Carrie9.Queen of the Silver Dollar10.Roland the Roadie & Gertrude the GroupieI don't think you'll find a cd from Dr.Hook & the Medicine Show with this particular combination of songs on one disc. These are some great songs, and this is a good cd to have. I know, I enjoy mine. Thanks!!!"
2,Beat the Drum,"It had it's interesting points, for example how the Africans were viewingthe AIDS epedimic. The acting and story line was more like a documentary."
5,Wrong Category,"Dear Sir or Madam:I am Chauncey Chen, the author of Dynamic ChiKung. My book is a health book, though very spiritual, but it is not a spiritual or religeous book. I hope you can make some corrections. By doing so, I believe you will promote sales.Sincerely,Chauncey Chen"
5,very reliable and lightweight,"This knife is a great asset to my kitchen. Not only is it lightweight, but the handle itself has great grip. The edge of the knife is quite sharp. I have owned this knife for about half a year and have yet to sharpen it. Everyone who comes over to help cook and has used this knife has been quite impressed."
5,Amazing,This brand of knives is the best on the market! I have spent hundreds of dollars on all of the famous big name brands and nothing compares to this one.
2,The paint comes off,The paint comes off if they are used much and the most used gets dull.I'd love to return or find out what the problem is. I bought 2 friendscomplete sets as well as myself. All three sets are doing this.
1,Lousy quality,"I have always been a Kitchen Knives fanatic always trying to find the best, lately I have been buying SHUN products, but I do not recomend this line of products, very light, lack of craftmanship in resume it do not seem to be from SHUN"
4,"great reference,good part numbers, lots of pictures",Definiatly a good book for the back yard mechanic. Tons of information to get the novice thru his first rebuild. Buy the book and save yourself the headaches. worth the price hands down.
1,"wrong item, bad services","Slow shipping, received finally, but wrong item that was powder-coated instead of galvanized that I ordered. This was not all, 20 of them are not fully coated. After spoke and emailed to ANTOnline, I was directed to manufacturer. the manufacturer directed me back to ANTOnline for more info. Called ANTOnline towice, followed with no action. It has been two months and is too cold to work outside now. It has been my headache."
3,Not truly representative...,"What I ordered was originally lost, but a second attempt arrived. It was not what I thought I was ordering. What was supposed to be galvanized was powder-coated brown. When I sent a request to return the item, I received a timely response, but nothing stated about the misrepresentation of the item being sold. Without being sure I would be reimbursed for shipping ""to"" and/or ""from"", I've decided to let it go and try to use the item in my project."
3,Cool,"This is a cool CD. It mixes themes and techniques from lots of bands like Voivod's Nothingface, King Crimson's Red and Drive Like Jehu. Damon Che sounds like Billy Cobham in Inner Mounting Flame/Birds of Fire era Mahavishnu Orchestra, though a little more spastic. Good CD to put on when you need that extra energy to clean the house or repair your spaceship."
4,Literary Letters,"Lovers of L.M. Montgomery's writing might be intrigued by her letters to a writer in England. They start out with her providing literary mentoring to him and then the correspondence develops into a friendship.I found it a bit slow at first and then my interest picked up when she wrote about her work on Anne of Green Gables and the sequels. Her descriptions of Prince Edward Island are quite appealing. Her letters show an urgency with the sinking of the Lusitania and the events of world war one. There are some family photos, but I wished for more."
5,Top Quality,"I found ""Smile"" (1976), by the late great Laura Nyro (1947-1997) a dreamy, romantic recording. Her music seemed to be lopped into a category of other ""female"" sensitive songwriters/recording artists, like Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez. But I hate categories. Nyro was 29 the year this album was released, and the tunes on it that she wrote -- standouts include ""I Am the Blues,"" ""Stormy Love,"" and (my personal favorite) the title track ""Smile"" -- are deeply felt and, get this!, mature.I prefer ""Smile"" over previous album recordings ""Eli and the Thirteenth Confession"" (1968) and ""New York Tendaberry"" (1969). ""Smile"" is emotionally transporting. Shut off everything else, and lull in it. It's a ""top quality"" recording from an artist who never got the fame she so rightly earned."
4,"Laura Nyro's ""Smile"" will make you smile!","Let's get this straight... I love this album. It's romantic, it's sad, it's exotic... and I personally love Laura's voice from this period the most. In defense of all the people who ever described Laura's voice as 'sexy,' this album and Nested (sadly out of print... Why?) would provide mighty evidence to backup these claims. One major flaw though.......it's very short, at just 31 minutes. Still, 'Children of the Junks' is better a better Joni Mitchell song than anything Joni ever wrote... and at the price Amazon is selling this album for, it's well worth the investment!"
5,Awesome Series,"This is an awesome show. Wish it lasted longer. Cowboys, sci-fi, humor and Bruce Campbell, who could ask for more. If you like Bruce Campbell this is him at his best. Well tied with Army of Darkness. Pure Fun!"
5,Briscoe County Jr DVD complete series,I was thrilled to find what I thought was the lost series of Briscoe County Jr. The DVD set is packaged perfectly in a all in one opening box. I am completely satisfied with my purchase and I really enjoy watching all 28 episodes very much. I highly reccommend this set if you love western comedies with a science fiction flare.
5,Awesome!,This was one of the best TV shows of all time. The writing was so far ahead of its time. Must watch more than once because so much dialogue gets missed while you're laughing. So very tongue in cheek. Just plain awesome.
4,Adventures of Brisco County Jr a Wonderful Time,"Without commercial interruptions, the series flows with few missteps. Characters are rounded out over time, drawing the viewer into a comfortable relationship with each. Possible situations are the norm rather than probable, but all add to the fun of watching this cast. Recommended viewing for families, especially with children age 10 and above. Adults will enjoy artfully phrased innuendo."
5,The best ever Bruce Campbell,"This show was the begining of the sceince era as it was told, had some very fantastic inventions, ideas, all common items today but just imagine back in the old west at the turn of the century, it is great."
5,As Good as I Remember,"I caught a few episodes of this show when it came out on TV, and was glad to see it released on DVD. A shame it only got one season. The shows are entertaining and well done, with a nice variety of characters. A fun distraction during a long work-out."
5,Brucarific,Brisco County Jr is an awesome combination of cereal western and campy comedy. Bruce Campbell delivers big time with his own unique style of physical comedy. There are quite a few special features that should keep even the most hard core Bruce fan happy. There's also a who's who of old western stars in this series as well as the lovely Kelly Rutherford as the sultry Dixie Cousins. I'd recomend this series to any Bruce fan or any cereal western fan. The cliff hangers in this show will keep you on the edge of your seat.
4,Good combination of types of storylines in one show,"Was fan of show when originally shown. Good combination of western,drama,comedy,mystery,sci-fi,historical,informative types and varieties of entertainment used in storyline. Characters were well cast for their roles (especially Pete and Lord Bowler and Comet, the wonder horse). Recommend highly, especially if you are a Bruce Campbell fan. Was disappointed when series ended."
4,One of the best shows ever produced!,Thanks for making this series available. I am thoroughly enjoying watching each episode.Bruce
4,Excellent series for fans of Bruce Campbell,"This is great for fans of Bruce Cambell. He tends to play one character in all of his work and if you enjoy him in Burn Notice or Army of Darkness, then this might be for you. It is a cowboy show laced with science fiction. Campbell is always looking for the ""next big thing,"" e.g. a drive through window. There are recurring allies and villains. There is an underlying plot to the series as well. Enjoy!"
1,where are the chapter selections?,"I love this show and although pricy, I still bought it because my hubby is very discriminating when it comes to dvds and he loves this show. I only have one large complaint. There is no way to access into an episode when you are watching it except to fast forward to the place you ended the time before.This is truly a shame as each episode has built in chapters available. Kate"
1,MSRP $99.99? What do DVD producers have against geeks?,"What is the major malfunction with studio execs?I don't expect them to produce DVDs as a public service, or anything, but this is ridiculous! Any season of Star Trek, Farscape, (until recently) Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, and now Brisco County Junior are obscenely overpriced.A hundred bucks is a lot to ask, but the studios will keep asking it because they know desperate geeks like myself will pay it.Well, to [bad word] with that. I refuse to buy any season of Star Trek, Farscape or Brisco County Junior until the studios treat geek fans with the same respect they give fans of non-geek shows like Friends, The Simpsons and Monk."
5,Brisco who?,"I hope the dvd set does this series justice. It was a quirky western with good writing and acting. It is one of those shows you need to watch more than once due to the subtle humor involved. A great cast and lots of fun, what more could one ask!"
5,Briscoe County,"I loved this show in the early ninties and have not seen it since. When it came up on offer I dived on it. It is a very entertaining sci-fi/comedy western with none other than Bruce Campbell, star of the Evil Dead movies. An excellent show with a variety of characters and storylines. A must see for any Bruce Campbell fans out there."
3,No Closed Captioning,"Although it is written on the package that this series is closed captioned, the closed caption option does not work. (The French and Spanish subtitles worked fine though!) It was not user error, as I generally watch DVDs with the closed caption on. I went on-line to see if there was any trick that I should be trying to get the closed captioning to work, but only found other people who also could not get the closed captioning to work. If you need closed captioning, do not buy this series."
5,Too Bad It Didn't Last Longer,"Brisco County was never intended to be a serious western or a comparison to ""The Wild Wild West,"" although similarities cropped up. It didn't take itself seriously, and all the actors played their roles over the top, to emphasize the fact that this show was a farce. Once you realized the nature of the show you could just relax and enjoy it. This was not a series that would hold up under scrutiny, but it wasn't intended to be. It's just a shame that the series was cancelled before it really got a chance to go somewhere. I've seen Bruce Campbell in a number of quirky roles, but Brisco County is the one that he'll probably be remembered best for."
3,"It's ok, watchable","I really like Bruce in the few things I have seen him in. Maybe I am not getting all the humor, though there is some, but there is a whole lot of ""try and be serious"", that role just does not suit Bruce... in my opinion.But that is only because he does the clown so well! (sorry for typecasting)However, having said that, it is still very watchable and I am glad I bought it. Just because things are not as you were expecting, does not make them bad, you just have to appreciate them for what they are.There is a whole lot of little cameos in it too.. you know, where you say ""where do I know that person from?"" :)"
2,Selective memories...,"I love Bruce. Big Evil Dead fan. Watched this show when it was on air when I could and was happy when the dvds came out.However, after watching the show again, it just wasn't nearly as funny as I remembered it to be. Guess I just remember the highlights (""You touched Pete's piece! Nobody touches Pete's piece."") with a lot of fondness. Having to sit through all the stuff in between the great lines was almost painful. I got through most of the first year but then simply had to stop. I prefer to have the pleasent memories of the series over what was being done to those memories having to sit through them all these years later.Thank god Burn Notice is out so I can at least have a really good show to fall back on and enjoy the antics of the great Campbell."
3,un western steampunk,"voici une curieuse serie tele qui presente bruce campbell dans le role de brisco county junior , un chasseur de prime qui part a la poursuite de l homme qui a tuer son pere, tous les episodes ou presque sont un curieux melange de scenarios de western classique qui serais pollues par des attitudes et des equipements du 20 eme siecle : un cannon trop puissant pour l epoque , un professeur et sa fusee etc, malgre tout, cette serie reste agreable a regarder et sans crier au chef d oeuvre permet de passer quelques bonnes heures a regarder les episodes de cette serie"
3,Really like this show but...,"I really liked this show when it originally aired and eagerly watched and enjoyed all (well most) episodes once gotten on DVD. This show has great characters, wonderfully weird story lines, an overall storyarch is followed, and is ALMOST family friendly.This is what frustrates me the most, that it is ALMOST family friendly. It is not overly violent and the heroes are all likeable. The problem is in the number of showgirl scenes (including the German blacksmiths, the belly dancers, the Vegas girls, and every single episode with Dixie Cousins (who was a great character overall) had her starting out or finishing off in a scantily clad custume) and the few roles in the hay (some literal). I find these scenes (short though they may be) embarassing to watch myself, and are what keep me from allowing my kids to watch.It's a shame, as the rest of the show is great and something I would have liked to be able to watch as a family."
3,"The ""late"" John Astin","This isn't a review, since I think it's kind of silly to review a DVD before it is released (although I loved the Brisco County Jr. show). I just wanted to point out that contrary to one of the reviews, John (Addams Family) Astin is, as of this date, still very much alive."
4,Campy Cowboy Sci-Fi,"I enjoyed Brisco County Jr when it first aired back in the early 90s.Now I'm enjoying this with my kids. The show is campy (as are almost all of Bruce Campbell's works), the stories are a bit implausible, but it's totally family friendly. And given what's being passed as 'family' entertainment, I'll buy more dvds like this. If my kids are begging to watch this, I think it's money (and time) well spent."
5,John Astin Lives!,"One of the reviews below refers to the actor John Astin as ""The late John Astin"". Fortunatley, this is incorrect. The man is alive and teaching acting at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. He is a staunch supporter of local theatre and a mighty fine teacher. Not only that, he tells a good story or two.That small mistake aside, the Brisco County DVD release is among the greatest artistic events of the century. Just like the acting of the current John Astin."
1,don't do business with this seller,They advertised the book in great shape with the jacket. What we got was an old green book with no jacket.
3,Simply not as intense.,"Dave Matthews is one of my favorite bands, and I have most of their/his CDs. With that in mind, I have to say that I don't agree with some other reviewers who rated this CD highly. Actually, the CD is good taken alone, but I've heard much better from DMB. This concert seems to lack the soul of Chicago, Red Rock or Luther College. I attribute some of that to DMB's blossoming vault of hit song, and an obvious desire to get more of those hits into the show, meaning keeping them short (translate- less of their trademark improvisational jams). Many of the songs sound pretty close in length and style to the studio versions in fact. On the plus side, there are some good jams on the CD, and the band seems to be in sync, but it's just not enough of the DMB I've grown to love"
2,another long concert,"this disc features the run of the mill concert from dave. not everything can be Live In Chicago, but you know, its ok, you can't be angry at the band for doing what they do best. its fine while its playing, but you don't remember it right after. This one is for Die Hards only and I obviously don't wear that title."
3,It's Dave so you have to love it,"The version of crash rocks. But the setlist is weak. If you like Dave's new stuff from Busted stuff and lilywhites then this album is for you. But if youre like me and are more into his oldies but goodies then this cd may not be a favorite. I still encourage you to buy it, add it to your collection, and support DMB."
5,Unreal,By far the best Dave Matthews Band CD. Recorded at a great venue for their music. All the songs on this CD were great with excellent energy. You can definately feel the energy of the crowd in this CD. Excellent renditions of 'Warehouse' 'Crash Into Me' and 'Angel' are followed by the excellent energy of 'Two Step' 'All Along the Watchtower' and 'Ants Marching.' Live at Folsom Field is a must have for any Dave Matthews Band fan and serves as a great example of their music for new listeners.
3,Average Live Release,"I've been a dave head for over 6 years now and have purchased every release. Live at Folsom Field is about as mainstream as you get. I didn't get the same energy from this live album as I got from Live at Red Rocks (95) and Live in Chicago (98). If you really enjoy the music, this is a live album for you. If you are just getting into dmb, I definately recommend not purchasing this, but trying one of the others mentioned above.Don't get me wrong, the live show isn't horrible, but everything sounds fairly bland compared to other shows I've been to and heard. I'd have to compare this along the same lines as Listener Supported. :("
3,Not worth it,"My suggestion. Don't bother. Some solid material, but not enough to make it worth it. By far DMB's worst live release, and not just because of the material chosen. I mean a lot of the material is great: a killer version of the rare JTR, solid version of Everyday, Watchtower, Two Step and Ants. But most of the material featured is Everyday material or weak Busted Stuff material (i.e Diggin A Ditch). Every other live album is worth it to pick up, and listen to, this one is not. I give it a three just because it's not like they fell flat on their face and released a terrible concert, they just...did not release one of their best."
4,The new stuff is better live.......,"Many fans of DMB were not happy with the last two albums and I agree they were up to par with the first three. After hearing some of the material live though I must say that it is pretty decent and Dave knew what he was doing when he brought them out with the intention of jammin to them live. I have all the live albums and they are all good so I won't rank this one. I could of done without the 10:00 plus Angel though. Other than that, better energy and set than Live at Chicago and Two Step stil hits that sweet spot.PS. Am I the only the one that hates ""Stay"" and they put on every live album.Bottom Line: A great live album. People unfamiliar with DMB could definitely start here."
3,Disappointing Quality,"These ""offical"" live releases exist for one reason: to provide top notch quality live recordings. Folsom fails in this regard alone, making it's existance questionable. The setlist is actually a lot better than it appears and the Everyday tunes hold their own against DMB staples. But the quality......i coulda gotten better from a bootlegger, and for free."
2,yawn,this cd is pretty boring.infact that years whole tour wans't that great.so there is big eyed fish/bartneder yahoo.that and angel are about all thats good on the cd. the rest is rather blah.What you are live is great but not from that year. What you are is much better now with the long ending.anyhow i wassn't too impressed with this CD.There were a lot better shows from that year that should have ended up on a live album.
3,DMB does it again!,Yet again another brilliant live album from the Dave Matthews Band. As any fan knows this band is incredible live. We are so lucky that they put out as many live cd's as they do. This has most of the concert favourites. I would say its a must have for the Dave fan.
2,Dave Matthews Band is done!!,"The album is great as far as production goes. My problem with DMB is that they haven't had an original idea in years! If you are a ""Dave-head"" you will like it. Casual listeners beware. This is too mainstream pop for my tastes."
5,wow,"this is a nice change up from previous live albums.... live at chicago was great, but only released one or two new songs live.... here a nice blend of busted stuff songs, everyday (which does offer some better versions live than the studio especially what you are and everyday 36), as well as some oldies including recently..... but what makes this cd great is its encore with a smashing two step into ants marching..... keep releasing these live albums dmb... they capture you all in true form...."
2,Less than splendid,"I must agree with the above review. I am unimpressed. I'm not sure why DMB is fond enough of the 2001 tour to select a show from it to release. It was uninspiring, in my opinion, at best. I love this band, and I love their music, but I'm not a fan of this album. There needs to be more spontaneity. I'm tired of hearing the same songs on live releases over and over. DMB has become a ""magnet for money,"" and sometimes I think it's all they care about. This Everyday-packed live release will certainly sell well with many, but not me. I'll take my 20 bucks elsewhere. I'll also take my 50 bucks for a concert ticket and spend that on 5-6 club shows where I can see more inspired, hungrier live acts like Agents of Good Roots."
1,another live album?,"It seems that Dave Matthews band can no longer put together a valid studio album, and so have settled for 'another' live album. And it's been released shortly before Christmas? Unbelievable."
2,yawn,"this cd is pretty boring.infact that years whole tour wans't that great.so there is ""big eyed fish/bartneder"" big deal.those are the only good songs on the CD besides ""JTR"".""What you are"" live is great but not from that year. ""What you are"" is much better now with the long ending.anyhow i wasn't too impressed with this CD.There were a lot better shows from that year that should have ended up on a live album."
1,Jam band? Hmmph!,"Why does the term ""jam band"" have to translate into tedious, repetitious detours in 9-minute songs? There are hardly any of his good hits on here, and there is too much of that gospel singer on this album. I would feel ripped off if I went to a DMB concert and did not hear ""Crush"" - which is a song that I actually enjoy listening to its full 8-9 minute version, unlike other DMB stretched-out songs I hear on this album.So, are you into rock or are you into ""jam bands"" and gospel? Avoid this. There must be better DMB live albums out there. I mean his fans just rave and rave about their live concerts, and they have quite a concert following..."
1,The 'Soviet Army fake pop-soup group of America',"This disc should have started with Tchaikovski's 1812 Overture instead. The Dave Matthews 'Colonial' Band has missed another opportunity. Interestingly enough, the set begins with 'Don't Drink The Water'. Not reassuring."
4,My four year old son loves it.,"OK--so I knew this would be messy even before I purchased it, but my son is really into pirates, so I figured it could be an outdoor toy. The sand is VERY clingy to hands/table, etc. So indoors could really make a big mess.The pieces are really cute, but they are very tiny. So I don't think it would be good for any child younger than 4.All that said--he just loves this toy. Even his 8 yr old sister wants to join in, and it seems to hold his interest a long time, which is rare. The box is very sturdy and is holding up well, even though it got rained on one day! It would be nice if they had included an extra package of sand, since it is inevitable that it is slowly disappearing over time.Overall, it is a big hit with my 4 yr old son!"
2,too small and what a mess for a 2 year old,this thing was no larger than a kchen plate and i know i should have looked at the size closer but for a 2 year old parts are choke hazards. Plus for a 2 year old cleaning upblue sand off the carpet all day really sucks.
1,worst ball ever!!!,i bought these and shot about 20 of them before a war to see how they worked...19 out of the 20 blew up in the gun..the one that didnt blow up couldnt have hit the broad side of a barn! simply the worst paint ball ever!!!!!!!DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
4,Gained clearer understanding,"I really enjoyed this book. There were times that it was hard to read due to literal translation I believe. There were phrases and such that were not normal in english. However, this book is GREAT in that it shows why some people chose to stay despite the persecution they received. It also shows how they really did not at the time have a clear understanding of what was happening to their friends and family when they disappeared. I also felt so bad for the son Fredrick who was trying to get her out. I cannot even imagine what he went through and how broken he must have been. I would reccommend it to those who are willing to look beyond the translation and see the heart of it."
3,Good mirror; useless light,"The mirror and folding handle are excellent and well constructed. The blue light is weak, illhminates a small area, and does not allow one to judge skin color."
3,too small,the mirror is really too small for people with poor eye sight. if it were about five or six inches in diameter it would be much better.
2,Too cumbersome!,"I purchased this for use as i recently became diabetic. However, after several weeks, I have only used it four times! It's just too bulky and hard to manage for daily use. And the viewing area is too small once you angle it under your foot. I was REALLY disappointed in the product and would most definitely NOT recommend it to others. I didn't even want to give it to someone else because it was so un-user friendly."
2,Okay,"This is not a fun book to read. It's like an old textbook in a community college. It's okay, and it's worth reading, but it's not worth the money. You won't gain 15 bucks of information in this book. If you want to know about independent filmmaking buy Rick Schmidt's Feautre Filmmaking at Used-car prices. This is well worth the read and the money."
2,Bleh,"This book is out of date, and the ""famous director tales"" are only a few pages in length each. Not worth the money. Would be interesting to see how this book would look if were written today, with the impact of DV."
3,Clay gun.,I am a little disappointed in this product. The construction is sturdy but is to difficult to push your clay or fondant through.
3,too small!,"Way smaller than expected. just under 4 inches in length. i read comments that some people used for cake decorating, but it seems small for that even. i havent used it yet so i cant rate functionality. but as a potter, this is almost too small to be useful. just be aware if you are buying this that the clay you extrude will be almost too fragile fire. but hey, its only 10 bucks so there ya go."
5,Great Watch!!!,"This is a beautiful watch. I already have 2 Movados and love this one just as much. The face is fairly small compared to my other ones, but it's such a unique style. It goes with everything; you can dress it up or just wear it everyday."
3,"For the price, a decent deal","The wall charger lasted three months, and the ""antenna booster"" is a hoax, but the low price for two chargers makes this a decent deal."
4,An informative Latin American travel book,"The book is better titled ""Patagonia to Baja"" since the adventures begin at the tip of the continent and work their way back to Baja. The book is divided into 9 adventures which the author and his wife experienced in Chile (4), Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Baja California (for this one, a friend joined him instead of his wife). Each story was exciting and informative. The trips to Chile and Argentina were done without a guide service, while the other trips were guided trips. These were trekking and sea kayaking trips (they camped-out instead of staying in hotels). At times I felt as if I were there with them. I'm planning a South American adventure in the future and found this book to be valuable in giving me insights into this part of the world."
5,Down for me is Up,"This album is probably my favorite JL album, even compared to Liar.It's just crushing, and bass lines (like on 50 cents) just don't come around often enough. While i am glad to see bands such as the Dennison Kimbel Trio rise from the ashes, the Jesus lizard are just so seminal, and i think this album really captures why."
3,"I thought it was ok, I guess...","I thought it was okay, I guess.But it doesn't measure up to the other Jesus Lizard stuff that I love (though it is alot better than the SHOT or BLUE albums, which both totally suck!!)"
5,waiting for the reunion tour,"This is the best Jesus Lizard album, with its unique arrangements and stellar songwriting.Or is it ""Liar,"" with it's amped-up crunchiness?Now that you mention it, ""Goat"" is pretty essential.The singles/rarities collection ""Bang"" is also hard to beat.""Head/Pure"" might be more difficult to access until you're into them, but then you get even more of their best songs.Heck, even ""Shot"" (despite being the ""major label sellout post-Albini album"") is most assuredly rocking."
4,"Very good, but not their best","""Head"" and ""Liar"" are tied for first regarding Jesus Lizard recordings. You cant really go wrong getting any of them, so whatever your mega cd store can carry, fear not and buy it. This one will put an odd look on the faces of old Lizard fans, though. Its very slick, methodical, and muted somewhat. ""Misletoe"" is a ragged, jangled rant that ranks with their best, heaven knows what its about, but who really cares when its up loud? ""Countless Backs of Sad Losers"". from what I can tell, is either David Yow's attempt at a political statement, or about the way things are because of the travails of ruthless alpha males, or maybe Im just an idiot and should refrain from interpretation, especially of someone who is as obtuse and cryptic as Yow is. ""50c"" is what David Yow would pay your mother to screw the band...those are my favorites, the cd drags a bit at the end, but all in all, this is good money spent if you cant get any of the early ones."
1,Not that good,"I didn't like this season. I watched the first season and simply loved it. This season is just badly constructed. The interviews with the people are too short, there is too much switching, they rarely manage to interview them with questions on the subject of their job, way too much time is spent by filming their cars and parties and hobbies, ...All of this would not have been a problem for me, if there was just some more time spent talking about their job, the way they make money. I had the strange feeling the makers of this season weren't interested in that at all, but more in making a glittering show. This is just my impression after viewing this season. Too bad, because the people interviewed weren't boring at all and I think the makers could have easily gotten more information out of them.I have given this season a 1 star rating for showing me how things are looking inside the world of asset management. I simply couldn't get more out of this dvd."
4,Fun series,"I work in finance so this interested me and I never saw on TV. My husband and I watched all the episodes and enjoyed them. We really liked the outtakes at the end, some of the responses were hilarious. Kudos to Brett as he seems to have a great work ethic which is paying off."
3,"Still good, still Arcwelder, but...",...but just doesn't have the melodic edge of the earlier stuff. Buy the previous albums before adding this to your collection.
5,Perfect at what it is,"This work is entitled ""The Tent."" It is a container for a lot of things that are only loosely related. And, yes, it's a little uneven. But what else would it be? It's not a novel or a set of short stories. It seems to be designed as a loose, jangly collection of shorter and longer vignettes. If you want short stories, read short stories. On the other hand, if you are in the mood for some startling, interesting, thought-provoking creations of Margaret Atwood's mind, in chunks and longer passages of her appealing, readable prose, read this."
1,Pam Cookies:,I will never buy Cookies OL again. What I got was 5 boxed of cookie crumbs.Not one full cookie in the shipment.
4,Incredibly tasty but crumbly,"These cookies have incredible flavor. They're so good the flavor is addicting. But the cookies are crisp so they're crumbly to the point that you need a plate to eat one without getting crumbs all over yourself. One bite and the cookie disentegrates all over the place. If you don't have a soy, egg, milk or peanut allergy, these would be the ultimate cookie if it weren't for the crumbles."
3,Usual Great Pamela's Taste,"These cookies have the same old great Pamela's taste, however the box that I received contained 50 packets of broken and smashed cookies. The cookies are packed two in a foil pouch, 50 pouches in a cardboard shipping box. Every last one of the pouches was damaged (I assume during shipping) with damage ranging from both cookies broken into two pieces to the more common extreme of opening a pouchful of crumbs. Still edible, but oh, so annoying. Had the cookies been packed or shipped to avoid damage I would have given this product 5 stars for their excellent flavor (mild peanut butter, good chocolate wallop) and sweet tooth satisfaction."
5,Simply the BEST gluten-free cookie EVER!!,"When you eat these, you will forget they're gluten-free because they are the best tasting cookie ever!!!! I dont know about the other cookies that Pamela's Products offers, but this peanut butter choco chip is the best!"
2,crumbly and mediocre,"Like others stated, these arrived in crumbs. They also didn't seem that great in taste either. They are okay for ready made gf cookies but nothing special. We were not impressed. Wouldn't buy again."
1,NO GOOD AT ALL,I AM SO DISAPPOINTED BY PAMELA'S PRODUCTS ORGANIC PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIS. ALL THE COOKIE SMASHED WHEN I RECEIVED IT.
1,Crummy.,"As others have noted, these don't arrive as cookies. They arrive as crumbs. And, on top of that, the crumbs I received tasted stale. Customer lost."
2,"Cookies taste great, IF you like CRUMBS!","I LOVE these cookies, but I have ordered them several times from Amazon, and EVERY time I get them, 80-95% of the cookies are broken. They are not just broken in half, many are mostly just large crumbs ! Since they are a bit costly, and appear not to ever arrive intact, I will not be ordering them anymore. :("
3,Tasty but Crumbly - Eat them with a spoon!,"Like many have said, these cookies are really tasty. I love the flavor. I'm only rating 3 stars because I got six boxes and every box had approximately 75% of the cookies broken/crumbled. The recipe abviously needs to be tweaked. That being said, I too find it difficult to not eat a whole box in one sitting. I eat them with a spoon! They'd probably be very good sprinkled over vanilla ice cream - gotta try that. I love the flavor of these cookies, but hope that Pamela's fixes the recipe so they don't crumble in transit (or upon the first bite if you are lucky enough to get a cookie that is completely intact). I've tried several of Pamela's cookies and this is the only one that was COA (crumbs on arrival) :-)"
5,Best Finish Ever!,It's very easy to use and goes on quickly. I would definately recommend this product to family my and friends!
5,The profiteering continues,"The Glen Campbell boxed set ""The Legacy [1961-2002] is an excellent collection, containing lots of wonderful music.I purchased this box for $46.00 on Amazon just two years ago. Imagine if you will paying twice that just two years later, including a price of $106.00 for a new copy direct from Amazon. The third party vendors are also indulging in this crass and malicious profiteering, charging upwards from $95.00 for new and used copies.Don't purchase this here. It can be found on other sites for about what I paid. But if you love Glen Campbell, and want a comprehensive collection of his CAPITOL recordings, find it and buy it from another site."
2,Music from The Strokes? No. Interviews? No. Good DVD? No.,"It's just one of those things you end up watching at 3 in the morning. But skip this one. You should be sleeping.I am a die-hard Strokes fan so when New York Stories came out, I had to have it. Much to my disappointment, it turned out to contain no music by The Strokes, or interviews with any members of the band.If you still feel like you need to see this DVD, don't pay more than $5 for it. You have been officially warned."
1,i wish it was good,this dvd sucks. im a die hard strokes fan and expected the dvd to open up with some strokes music or and interview or two.there is absolutely no strokes music and they have a few like stock photos of them doin their thing live but other than that this dvd is a complete letdown.do not waste ur money go buy their two albums instead.
2,Not so good,"I understand this people were trying to do something interesting and yes they should get some credit for at least being bothered but I would not consider it a documentary for it is of very low quality and it seems more like a highschool student's project than something that can actually come out for the puclic. If they were trying to do something for The Strokes, after buying this (everyone makes mistakes) I think the best thing to do for your favourite artist is to buy their album and go see them play, after all music is what it's all about."
5,bought a gift for my son,I purchased this DVD as a gift for my son who was very happy and loved it! Shipped super fast.
1,new york stories,"If you DON'T like to listen to any strokes music, DON'T like to actually see footage of the strokes, or hear them speak... buy this DVD.If you like to listen to random people you could care less about talk about the band...or these people try to talk about the culture in the city, again, through random, uneducated, eyes, buy this dvd.I should have done more research on this product. I would not have purchased this had I been able to read the outside of the dvd case.This dvd is a waste of time and money.Thank you"
2,watch you talking about willis?,"The story of the Strokes is the story of wealth and privilege, and its endless amounts of free time to be arty and practice trying to act like Lou Reed and VU riffs. This was made without RCA, and so lacks strokes music.The band apparently wanted nothing to do with it, it is practically DIY, with no interviews. This just shows what a bunch of brats they are not to support this project. Their 2nd album sucked anyway."
5,Must have for boxer lovers,Fantastic book from one of the most important persons behind the creation of the boxer. You will remember this book for a long time after reading it.
3,Afternoon Art Print ~ You must like greens to enjoy this print,"I would definitely purchase from this company again however, I returned this poster. It didn't look ""as green"" in the photos online. I saw that a lot of customers purchased this poster along with the Master Bedroom dog poster so I tried it. The colors were way off, very lime greenish especially in the lower right hand corner area. Cute but didn't work with my color scheme."
2,cute too- but too expensive for what it is,"I was very disappointed in this toy. from the picture, it looked to be the size of a Barbie doll. It was not. It is only about 6 inches tall. The price that i paid was extremely high for this little doll. in the stores, similar ones are $6.99. I assume it was so expensive because these are not sold in the stores any more. I kept it, because my grand daughter loves the pink ranger and she is going to dress like that for halloween and i know she will love to have the pink ranger doll too"
3,Not bad,"This camera is pretty good quality for the price. It has a blue light that helps illuminate the image. The driver software seems to work fine for me, I had no problems setting it up. The image comes out very clear when you are well illuminated by lamp or by daylight, otherwise it is grainy. I'm also satisfied with the stand, I placed the cam on top of my CRT monitor"
2,definitely disappointed but easy to build,bought this shed from menards on sat and was delivered on sundayvery excited to use it i started building it right away with a friend helpingit only took about 4 hrs to build but we are both handy with tools so thats def not goingto be the same for everyone. My first and biggest disappointment was how weak and flimsythe doors are i cant believe that it is made in the USA pretty much all of it is flimsy exceptthe roof and flooring is pretty sturdy too i guess. The next biggest was how the heck is there absolutely no where for anything to be hung on the walls ps they are paper thin too. Def. wish i would have done a little more research bf buying this for 1200$ that the 10x10. The only thing i really like about it is that it expandable but being cheaply made it might not make it to me needing more storage space :( oh well its up and i guess im stuck with it hope it lasts at least 5 years or ill be really pissed
4,Suncast Shed,"I ordered my 7 1/2 x 7 1/2 shed from Sears. It was cheaper and I picked it up from the store to save on shipping. The shed came in 3 large boxes, so it took two trips with a van. 53"" x 34"" x 77"" and 440 lbs. Built the base with 4 cinder blocks, wood frame, & outdoor quality plywood. The parts looked a little flimsy before construction. The shed went up in a breeze. The base & sides took 1 1/2 hours to assemble and the roof took 1 1/2 hours. The roof was a two man job. Once assembled, it looks sturdy. It was an easy job and great for the price. I'm happy with the looks and quality. My expectations is that this shed will last me at least 5 years. I'll probably update this review once I find out how it stands some winter snow."
2,Quality of shed,I was disappointed in the quality of this shed. I had a concrete pad poured for this shed but apparently it wasn't as level as the company led me to believe. I still don't have use of the shed as the doors do not aleign up and won't shut. Its still a work in progress.Also the wrong hooks were sent and therefore I have to reorder them to be able to use them.The shed is not anything like the ones I looked at...at Lowes and Home Depot. A great disappointment to me.
1,Does not last!,"Purchased this shed and didn't have too many problems putting it together. Unfortunately, a year later, it was junk. The plastic became so brittle that a 1"" diameter 1 1/2' long stick from a tree fell on it and put a big hole in the roof. The doors are falling off and don't shut any more. Sides are bowed out and it leaks like a sieve (not just through the hole we tried to patch). Windows are opaque. Really disappointed. I should have invested the money in a wood shed that would last. The only positive, it will come apart easily and shatter into small pieces when I throw it away this summer."
3,Plastic shed,"Parts did seem very flimsy, but was surprisingly strong once assembled. I am a little disappointed in the doors they are sum what flimsy this is why I'm giving it three stars. I do plan to reinforce them with aluminum tubing, and come up with a better locking device. I would recommend this shed unless you are debating between this and building your own. If building is an option I would go that route. Overall it is a decent shed but I wish now that I would have built one."
2,regret purchase,"The side and roof panels are very thin, I was expecting something more durable. I have a Rubbermaid resin storage bin which have double-sided panels and is very durable. This product is nothing like that.I regret this purchase and for the money would rather have built it out of wood from the lumber store.UPDATE 01/10/10: A rather large mound of thin plastic panels is still laying in my carport with a nice six month patina of dust. I see no use in assembling this product for my purposes. A kid on a tricycle could crash through the wall easy. I would happily give it all away just to be rid of it. Might be okay for suburbs, but for rural county areas, a hand crafted steel building is the way to go. What was I ever thinking."
5,Very Easy to Assemble,I was very happy with this purchase from Amazon. It was much cheaper than the similar model at Home Depot. The assembly was easy. It was me and two teenager with the IQ of chimps and we got it together in 4 hours including site prep. It really is very large when assembled. It looks great compared to metal sheds I have seen.
4,Cute and Durable,Nice shed. Pretty easy to assemble. The walls and roof will need 2 people. Othewise it has rained here in new england pretty strong and the shed is dry inside. Amazon shipped to me 3 days earlier which was nice. It is definately a beautiful addition to our backyard!
4,"Vale la pena, por las pocas opciones que hay en México","En general el producto esta bien son 4 cajas bastante grandes y para armarlo necesitas la ayuda forzosa de una persona, puedes tardar casi medio dia en armarla, la protecon contra los elementos es buena no hay goteras pero si entra el polvo."
4,Storage Building,"The item was shipped in a timely matter, all the boxes arrived undamaged and the pieces were all present."
4,Rust to resin,"Product was ordered and was delivered amazingly quick!I had someone help me to set it up and it took no time from box to structure!Not the first Suncast product, but to date, the largest!This replaced a large rust structure and I was able to regain my backyard!"
2,"Suncast A01B28C03 Storage Building, 10-ft x 10-ft bad design","so thin 1/8"" thick walls, anyone can damgage it in no time. door warp badly as sun heated up. false advertise that wall is over 1"" thick but is only at the wall joints. The shovel accidently fell on one side of the wall and the the wall shred off a section. My neighbor have the plastic sheds and they all have around 1.5 to 2 inch thick walls all around. Materials inside heated up and would damage much quicker since heat absortion is so high 126 degree F. that is rediculous high compare to my old beat up shed only around 92 degree F in the same high heat summer day.This is a bad design. it is flimpsy and weak. I am worry a winter wind might flew the shed away. That's how bad it is."
5,great shed,"took 4 hours by myself to put up the shed, and i'm about average size, strenth and aptitude. took 4 days to make a platform for it though. after reading up on this type of shed I expected that having an absolutely flat foundation was essential for assembling them. so i did a bit of overkill and built the wooden foundation as per the detailed plan included with the shed. matches my house, looks nice. fits my lawn tractor and all the gardening junk.Addmendum, 2012. I've had this shed for 5 years now, and am as happy with it as I was on day one. It still looks and functions as nearly new, and gets some pretty hard use. I'm upgrading it from 4 star to 5 star based on longer term experience with it."
2,Below average quality,"Both the shuttle cocks went off within first 30 mins of amateur play. The newer shuttle cocks go and get entablged into the net of the racket.Overall, you may enjoy this only if you have little patience to search the shuttle in your racket, when you thought you smashed it in the opponent's court.Frankly speaking, I did not enjoy it for more than 10 mins. after which I gave up. I am seriously thinking of buying a little costlier but better quality rackets."
3,You get what you pay for,"The quality of the rackets isn't that great, but you get what you pay for. Good for summer parties and kids."
2,My memories of this were better than the current reality,"I listened to this in LP and cassette form when it first was released back in the Seventies on a daily basis while in college and thoroughly enjoyed it then; however things do change. I forgot how much sermonizing Stephen was/is prone to, and how much the guitar parts carried the whole enterprise. It was nice to hear Stateline again though with Stephen in the environment in which he always sounded best to me - solo and with an acoustic guitar. I wouldn't recommend the recording to someone new to Stephen's music - try ""Stills"" instead - and for old time fans my recommendation is to enjoy your memories without diluting them with reality and go buy something more interesting of the era."
2,Enervated Pop from a Former Master,"Not a good Stills record, and probably the first nearly worthless record the man made. ""Different Tongues"" is a pretty song, but this is music from a once-astonishing musician who had lost his way musically. You'd be better off buying anything recorded before this."
4,"A Bit More Polish, But...a little less shine","This is a very good album...(okay, CD)...not excellent. The polish on the tunes is tight and well done, but detracts a bit from the raw gold of the Stills experience. Again, the production quality is excelllent but just a little to spiffed up. However, as guilty pleasures go, :Midnight In Paris"" is such a catchy tune, and when Stills goes into his french lyrics, it does have a nice earthy undertone. (Sort of like a nice Chateau Lafitte Rothchild Vintage 1929.) Now, go buy it and enjoy. After all this is Stephen Stills here, ya ain't gonna go wrong."
4,"Hear, have a hit","Stephen puts it out there, and that just sums up where he's coming from to where he's at."
5,Can't go wrong with this desktop weather station...,"I recently purchased this unit and I am very happy with it. It shows both indoor and ourdoor temperature/humidity values on the screen at the same time. It displays air presure which allows you to see what the weather is like and will be like in the next day or so. It also graphs the last 12 hours of barometric readings. Determing the weather forecast is easy and accurate. Temperature and humidty values seem very accurate as well. It also has min/max values for just about everything it monitors, and has various sampling rates for each of the stored values. It has a nice amount of features and performs each feature very well. Can't go wrong with this unit."
1,"Almost, but not quite.","I purchased this from Amazon, and installed it on my computer. This package does not contain VB 2005 Express. It has Web Developer 2005. Will be returning it for refund."
4,kewl toy andi mean it!,"this toy is really really cool even though the wand is bigger then it's soppused to be thats alright becuz this toy is ""da bomb"" lol!"
5,Not just for boys!,"My 5 year old daughter flipped out when she saw this gift Christmas morning. Since then she's been sporting several tatoos, including the 'scar' on her forehead. I have been turned into many things a cat, a quiet mom, a frog. My daughter loves to play dress up and this is an excellent addition to her collection."
5,FUN & EDUCATIONAL,It is alot of fun for harry potter fans as they get to dress up as their favourite hero. it is also educational as young kids get to know how people wore these cloaks and it brightens their wardrobe imagination as they can grow to become inspiring designers. plus it is very comfortable ...
4,We had fun with this!,"This was a really fun purchase. My son wore this to a Harry Potter book party in Hudson, Ohio. Everyone kept asking us where we got it. He has since worn it in the house several times. We are planning on using it for Halloween as well.Purchases like this make the books come to life."
1,As bad as it can get...,"1. They are only half full and the color is barely visible2. The balls are breaking too easy.You can also buy them at walmart, i guess the only advantage is that they are really cheap."
4,Great for the purpose intended,"We bought this stereo for our 10 year son. He enjoys it and uses the alarm function everyday. It saves me trying to get him up every morning.Some of the other models we looked at had sliding doors and that was cool, but a 10 year old boy would have that taken apart or broken it no time. This is a much sturdier model!"
3,Sony Microsystem,"I believe Sony makes good products in general, and I am pleased with the quality of this product."
3,"Excellent sound for the price, but...","This one does have a great sound for the money, 5 stars there and definately better than the comparable panasonic. Design, however could use some tweaking. First, it is a bit large from front to back, and has features such as cassette deck that I will never use. The mp3 line is great to have, but is in an awkward location in the back -kind of a pain for those of us who like to take our mp3 players on the go often. Also CD player is on top which could prevent you from access if you want to put in on a high shelf or in a spot with not much room above player. If the design issue doesn't bother you and especially if you might actually use the cassette and it's recording features, this one definitly is well worth having for the sound alone."
2,Quit working,"I loved my Sony CMT NEZ-30 for about a year. I purchased it at Best Buy for $99. Then it started to act finicky -- wouldn't play CD's. Said ""NO DISC"" even though I had the disc loaded. The next day I would try again and it would play. Did this off and on for 6 months and then quit completely. I was disappointed because I was very happy with the looks, the sound and all of the features. It was perfect for me. I contacted Sony and it cost more to repair than the purchase price. Very disappointed!!"
1,Reliability low,"My unit (purchased from Amazon for $100 dollars) failed after 17 months (5 months longer than the warranty period). This is not an acceptable life for an electronic item. I expected the life would be more than 3 years. Clearly, Sony does not care about their customers. In recent years, a few of Sony components I purchased just seem to be low quality. Like a car, the main feature the consumers look for is reliability. Design features are important, but the consumers will eventually turn away from Sony products, if they can't meet or exceed life requirements. For my next purchase I am looking at non-Sony products now."
3,sounds good tape recorder flimsy,I bought this on amazon. price was good. The sound is very good. size is pretty small (which can me a plus or minus - depending on your preference. compare product dimensions with your expectations )Hoewver . . the cassette player broke within a week of purchase and Ireturned it for a replacement. Not sure if my unit was unusual in this regard. 3 stars for hassle I had due to what I view as flimsy design quality in tape deck. I would otherwise highly recommend.
1,Ugh.,"I could barely get through this book. It was full of ""real-life examples"" that were so obviously made up that it was nauseating. The author can't seem to get past stereotyping the issues one might have with their looks, which makes it difficult to take her seriously. One of the first things she talks about is the societal oppression of women by men, and although there may be some truth to that notion, I don't feel that I have to resent men in order to love my looks. This book is annoying and I wish I could return it."
4,Fun Kids Songs,"This album is this Irish folk singer's answer to entertaining the little ones. Of the albums of his that I own, this is the one I listen to least, but that statement is not meant to diminish his performance on this CD. As a second grade teacher I love some of the old classic children's songs on here that aren't sung anymore like ""There's a Hole in the Bucket,"" but also some of the newer ones like the title track. The main reason that I am not as fond of this album compared to others and the reason for the four instead of five star review is because it is not recorded live as some of the other ones are. It's fun to listen to how he plays the crowd on the live albums. All in all I recommend this album for those that are interested."
4,Good collection,"This is very good, good recording quality, good to excellent performances. But I ordered several more more than a month ago as gifts for family members around the country, and Amazon hasn't shipped. What's up?"
5,Astounding value!,"I received this box recently; Paid $27.49 with free shipping from Amazon. This contains some super performances and is definitely not one of those pseudo-named collections offered by Madacy, Vox and other. The one thing that puzzles me is why Sony/BMG packed this collection in a box which is twice as large as is needed. That said, most heartily recommended!"
3,A note about other reviews,"Just a note about all the reviews of this item. The price has varied all over the place, from less than $0.50 per disc to almost $3. The weighting of price/quality thus varies a lot. I'm writing this when the price is very high (list price plus $12!) I bought when it was low ($27). I'm happy. What will you be at your price?"
2,Maybe you will have better luck than we did...,"We had to return ours for a refund, fulfilled by Amazon quickly and without problems. The pogo stick wasn't structurally true, as the handles weren't parallel to the foot pegs! Additionally, one of the handles was shaped lower than the other and where the metal was curved/bent (handles and the body) it had small stress fractures. Beyond that, it seemed decent quality materials for the price. Did not contact the company for resolution/replacement, so uncertain if this is an exception for their product. Hopefully this won't be your experience."
3,Lost weight but at a cost,My 14 yr-old son LOVED this pogo stick....until it started bruisihng his inner thighs. He insulated the metal bars with foam and duct tape so it was more comfortable to use. He lost weight and tightened his abs--a great by product of simply wanting to do something fun. We were all thrilled!
5,Excellent!,"Once again, my husband and I received rave reviews for our selection of the Super Pogo 1505 for our grandson's birthday present! I was not there to see it, but by all accounts, this pogo stick far exceeded all expectations. One word of caution....Make SURE the recipient not only HAS a helmet...but also USES it! :)"
3,Super Pogo 1505 Pogo stick,"The product description was not thorough enough. It stated that the user should be within a specific weight range, but it gave no height or age range. When the product arrived, the outside of the box had a label that said, must be at least age 14. Our child could not use it very easily and we ended up buying another pogo stick more suited to the child's height and age. Also, the box was damaged upon arrival, though the product was intact. We will set it aside until the child is older and taller."
3,my review on super pogo1505,I received mine few days ago and my first impression --> very very heavy and too long (won't fit the back of mini cooper) but it seems very very very durable :)I'm 177 pounds and I feel that the spring are way too hard that it might be more suitable for 190 pounds and above. I wish theres a way to adjust the spring.My other complain is... it makes too much noise !! any suggestion on kind of oil or spray to use ? Thanks :) I really wish I got the kiddie version ones so I can also use it in my bedroom.
1,Dont overuse!,"When i first got this pogo stick, it worked fantastically, but i was constantly using it, and after about two months, the whole thing suddenly fell apart while i was jumping. So if you are going to be using this product a lot, invest in a better pogo stick! although if you are just occasionally going to be using it, its pretty good.NOTE: DO NOT POGO INTO THE MUD WITH THIS EITHER! I DID A FEW TIME AND THE BOTTOM STOPPER FELL OFF AND I HAD TO REPLACE IT MULTIPLE TIMES WITH DUCT TAPE BALLS. DO NOT POGO INTO THE MUD!"
1,Plastic pedal breaks off,"Although all of the other parts of this product are metal, the part that you put your feet on is plastic. My son broke one of the pedals off within a week of use. He was very disappointed. The only resolution was to return the product."
1,not for kids,"My 11 year old son weighs 85 pounds and could not get these springs to move. It worked fine for my husband who weighs 165 pounds, but even then it was difficult to jump on. We have tried many pogo sticks, and this was the worst! We are returning it."
2,Not a great idea at all!,"I really take time to read reviews before making any purchases on Amazon. This is not safe for teenagers, even experienced ones. This model is way too hard to jump on and way too easy to fall off of. The springs are too tight and even the hardest jumps don't make the unit move with ease."
5,red box,This pogo stick is good except that it hurts your knees from the red plastic piece above the spring. the design should be changed because it makes the inside of your leg by your knee red and it hurts.
1,"The Pole is too wide, hurt son","The width of the pogo stick bruised my son's legs, and he ended up duct-taping it and trying to make it work anyway so then it was too late for me to try to exchange or return it. He was really bummed, and tried to make it work."
5,POGO,The was a very sturdy piece of equipment. The spring was larg4e and the young man in addition to his parents van used it without breaking
5,Wow!,"My older teenage son wanted a pogo stick for Christmas. Most of the pogo sticks on the market are made for younger, lighter kids, but not this one. I was very impressed with the durability. This is a pogo stick that an adult can use. In fact, if you are not very heavy, you will not even be able to make the pogo stick move."
2,too heavy and bulky,"This pogo stick is much too heavy, stiff, and bulky. It is very difficult to jump on because of this. I had to return it for my 14 year old son who is normally very coordinated. Not so with this item."
5,Worlds Greatest Stick,"The Gravity Games Pogo Stick is by far the best pogo stick currently on the market. You can jump higher, jump longer, and enjoy the ride more than any other stick. It's not for younger kids, the spring is made for heavier old kids. When the whole world decides to take up pogo sticking, this is the stick that they will choose."
3,Looked more fun than it really is,"We bought the Pogo Stick as birthday gift for my 9 year old son. He loved it when he opened it up, but, soon became bored. It is quite sturdy. I imagine he can give it to his son when he has one. My 200lb, 6'3"",41 year old husband loves it, however"
5,"Five stars for finding it, not the movie itself","I remembered one scene of this movie, and tried to track it down at least 5 times a year for maybe 15 years. Everyone I asked thought I was crazy, until a co-worker suggested I post the description on reddit. He said there was a sub-reddit where people would post obscure memories of movies, TV shows, and music, and people would tell them the names.I posted it there and within 15 minutes I had my answer: The Double O Kid. I watched the trailer on youtube and was all but certain it was the movie. I then purchased it from Amazon hoping for the best: that was a mistake.This is indeed the movie, but after so many years of glamorizing it in my head, I think I ruined it. It's not a bad movie, it just isn't a good one. It's perfect for when you want to watch something, but your not sure what, and you don't really want to have to pay too close attention. I think I paid less than $5 for it though, and just being able to get it on DVD feels like a win."
1,C-movie,"No good script, no good actors, no good directing...nothing is good! One of those movies, you wished you haven't seen. Nicole Eggert and Corey Haim is back together, they have done ""Just One Of The Girls"" and ""Blown Away"" together before. So if you want to see the hot couple together, see one of those instead. This movie is not funny, at all."
2,Corey start choosing your film roles more carefully!!,"Corey Haims agent needs to be hung from the nearest lamp post until he is very dead!!!Utter drivel of this kind is just sealing the lid on Coreys career.Im beginning to realise that for some reason Coreys face must sayto producers Cute and very immature,because they keep casting him for cartoon standard mindless garbage that is aimed at thepre teen market.Stop now or vanish forever"
4,Underrated band,"Are You Driving Me Crazy is a brutally on-the-nose breakup record, but it draws you effectively into its misery. The end of the album drags a little, maybe this isn't a quality of the songs issue, just an exhaustion issue; a question of how much you can take. Nonetheless, ""Tuff Luck"" and ""Sometimes I Forget"" may outwear their welcome at 5+ and 6+ minutes respectively. But ""Berlitz,"" the ironically titled opener to a what is virtually a concept album about the failure of communication, sets a high bar with its ringing guitars and a almost documentary look at a collapsing relationship: ""I've forgotten the words again/ But I'm sure and I'm sure and I'm sure/ It sounds right, but the words come out so wrong/ Am I driving you crazy?"" Highly underrated band--all four of their albums are worth checking out."
4,solid sophmore effort,"This album marks the return of one of the most promising bands to come out in recent years.The other guy who reviewed this album either above or below this review, called the producer(not the director)Jon Bon Zeppelin? What was that...Its John Paul Jones. That guy doesnt know what hes talking about, so just get the album itll be worth the money."
4,Alexander Graham Bell,"I love this book because it provides a depth information about Bell and his works. The most interesting fact that I like in this book is how he invented the telephone by accident. I never questioned or wondered who invented telephones before until I have to do a project for my TED 451 at Cal Poly. By reading this book, I have learned who Bell is and his great inventions. I strongly recommended this book to anyone."
4,house tent,Its a very good tent for the price...my only complaint is that if i need replacement parts i can't find them i will be forced to buy a new tent all over again.
2,Not a good buy,"This canopy is BEAUTIFUL but the first time that we had a rain we were not home. The rain demolished it, broke the frame, etc. I would not buy again."
1,Awful- buyer beware,"Received a defective product, Customer service supervisor told me I should have gone to Sears to purchase the tent, as their product is much better. Company refused to return, replace or credit me. All they offered was a $50.00 ""store"" credit. As if I would shop there again. Company refused to stand behind their product. Also informing me that I can dispute the charge on my credit card, but it wont matter, as they always win. Talk about customer service! Buyer beware!!"
3,Mixed,"Blue Oyster Cult scored big with Agents of Fortune, yet fans sure don't consider it the band's magnus opus. Probably because AoF introduced ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" to the world of higher rock, it'll remain thier signature recording. Every note of the original ""Halloween"" soundtrack is culled from AoF, and thier musical contributions to a broad range of other well known films are strangely unacknowledged.This recording is all over the place. Some of the tunes are true masterpieces; others sound whipped up in two minutes at Dairy Queen. ""This Ain't the Summer of Love"" was (and remains)the classic cruising tune. ""...Vera Gemini"" introduced Patty Smith to and from the dark underworld created by Blue Oyster Cult as a heavy metal noir femme fatalus. ""Morning Final"", and ""Tenderloin"" explore the backstreets of New York with a startling clarity.Though this is not the band's best recording, it sure is worth a listen.Blessed be."
5,ON YOUR FEET OR ON YOUR KNEES !,"I HAD ABOUT 375 8-TRACKS BACK IN THE DAY-1971 TO 1980.NOW I AM RAPIDLY APPROACHING THAT NUMBER ON CD.BEING MOSTLY A HARD ROCK/METAL ENTHUSIAST,I WOULD SAY THAT AGENTS WOULD BE IN MY TOP FIVE DISCS OF ALL TIME!THE SAD PART IS THE ONLY DONT FEAR THE REAPER GETS ANY AIR PLAY.WHILE THIS IS A PHENOMENAL SONG,THE REST OF ALBUM SHOUD BE HEARD.ONLY KNOWING THE REAPER SONG WOULD BE THE SAME AS ONLY EVER LISTENING TO STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN FROM LEP ZEP ZOSO ALBUM.UNTHINKABLE!I KNOW ALOT OF PEOPLE WHO ONLY KNOW THE SONG KILLER QUEEN FROM SHEAR HEART ATTACK ALBUM BY QUEEN.THAT SONG IS B-SIDE REJECT COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE DISC.MY FAVORITES ON AGENTS OF FORTUNE ARE,THIS AINT THE SUMMER OF LOVE,TRUE CONFESSIONS AND THE BEST OF ALL DEBBIE DENISE.THIS CD IS A TRUE MASTERPIECE.THIS IS ONE CULT WE SHOULD ALL JOIN !"
3,Radical Departure,"After the first three albums, most notably the classic Secret Treaties, I was disappointed upon hearing this for the first time. Now I'm talking 1974 or so. It grew on me slowly and I ended up really liking E.T.I. and the Reaper. Vera Gemini I also liked. All in all a more commercial sound from this band and a definite turning point towards a new sound."
5,"nice, just nice","This is Death Black (Bassist) and this(the album in question) is the true world of BOC. This is when BOC said ""hey you mainstream bastards, we're in charge now"". Most state that BOC hit the top with Secret Treaties, and while it remains a wonderful album, I think that some of the songs on this one got a bum rap....Morning Final is an awesome song....it just wasn't publisized like Don't Fear the Reaper..... That's all.."
4,JUST LIKE ROMEO AND JULIET,"""This Ain't the Summer of Love"" is the weakest entry....and it was a top 40 hit. ""Tenderloin"", and ""Morning Finale"", comprise an urban wake-up call simply enchanting. IMHO Patty Smiths' warbling on ""The Revenge of Vera Gemini"" is as good as it gets. Stephen King's fave, ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", is an under-appreciated rock classic. All of the music for the original ""Hallowe'en"" movie is culled from this one song. You probably won't like the song ""True Confessions"", but your girlfriend will."
5,A Great B.O.C. Albumn!,"This is yet another great albumn by B.O.C.! Also it contains one of their best song, ""Don't fear the Reaper""! Add this one to your collection."
4,Roethlisberger Jersey,I purchased two jerseys as a gift for my nephew. He has been more than happy with them and they have held up well to the wear and tear that a teenager puts clothes through.
1,Sports n Stuff,"I ordered this product two months ago. First they sent me the wrong size. I ordered large and they sent extra large. Then they rerordered it and I am still wiaiting to receive it. Will never ever order another Sports N Stuff ..what a terrible service. No apologies, no credits and no incentive either. Unbelievable...!"
4,decent Deal,"Item arrived as pictured . Sizes are accurate, Price decent but a little steep for just a replica Jersey, but probably still the cheapest I could find."
5,Great!,"I am a jazz fan and this is my first Joe Pass CD, and I just loved it.I would recommend it to anyone and everyone :-)"
5,Music to unwind,Joe Pass has an exceptional sound. I enjoy listeding to his music especially when it has been a very long day and I need to unwind. It does the job!
1,not for your child that plays like a child,"My little girl was so happy to get this for Christmas but after she played with it for a few hours the material ripped in two spots. I wanted to remove the material so I can repair it but you cannot remove it without having to cut it off and then sewing to put it back on. my daughter continued to play with it even though it was ripped so I did not mind but then I noticed the frame was bent from her playing with it. I would not recommend this for a child that plays like a child. My daughter only pushed this around the house with her dolls in it and this is what happened in less then 2 weeks of use. She is not overly rough with her toys, she actually treats the toys she loves with more care then most children and she loved this toy so much that she took it everywhere with her."
5,A Delight For Any Little Girl,"This is the cutest item, and brought such excitement when given as a gift. Perfect if purchased for the appropriate age. The Toy Doll Stroller is sturdy and small enough for ""Little"" girls, but big enough for them to have fun giving there dolls a ride, just like ""Mommy"" does. It is finished off with cute details that duplicate the real thing. Very Cute Item and Very Well Received."
2,"Too flimsy, would not recommend this!","So flimsy, that the strips that hold the seat, tore within a day. The same thing keeps happening to all the 4 strips. Looks ok, although not practical for regular use. Maybe better for a smaller child who would not be adventurous with it???"
4,1.5 yo,Got this for my 1.5 yo daughter cause a different stroller we had was too big for her. This one is the perfect size for her to push around comfortably and is very girly cute.
2,Interesting but gets sidetracked.,Some good info on building a space elevator complete with mad industrialist with more money than god. There are misc other subplots though which were completely unecessary and uninteresting. Worth reading at a used price but not full retail.
3,another fine sf novel from the author of the Ganymede Club,"As always, Sheffield's mix of juvenile and adult characterscharms. Although not as polished as some of his laterwork, this tale of extended lifetime through drasticallyslowed metabolism is an absorbing read, characteristicas always by careful attention to physics, and a realappreciation of the scope of endeavour available tohumans."
5,see my review on the other listing of this book,"i think 'a reviewer' of feb 20, '97 must be thinking of a different book!!"
4,great guide to going on safari,"I may be biased as I am one of the many contributing photographers to this book. I think that David Anderson did a good job putting this book together and that it is very informative to anyone wanting to go on safari. His knowledge, years of experience and a true love for Africa shows in this book."
5,Feel Africa at Home,"We have been on two Safari's and ""On Safari by David Anderson"" tells it all for less than $100. It keeps memories alive and well...the joy of picking up this book and living the greatest vacations of our life is priceless! Everyone that looks at this book cannot believe how beautiful the animals, the people and the views are. The Lodges are especially suprising to all!If you can go on Safari with David Anderson, by all means go today...if not this book is a must have!!"
1,Still Waiting!!!!,"I ordered (and paid for) the book, ""On Safari"" a month ago and it still hasn't arrrived! I need the book now, any suggestions as to what I do now?"
5,Music you won't feel stupid dancing to,"""Tucked In"" starts things out with a slinky, menacing, insidious groove and pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the record. While some songs are better than others (""Raindrop"" being my personal favorite), Cruise Yourself is an extremely solid collection of utterly infectious rock 'n roll. Essential."
3,"Ambitious for its time, but out of date.","This book has been superseded by the later work of George Andrews Moriarty, which (unfortunately) does not appear to be in print but is available at research libraries specializing in genealogy.Turton is probably accurate for the generations closest to Edward IV and his queen Elizabeth Woodville, but has to be checked for earlier and non-English lines."
5,Relaxation,"The sounds on this 3 special packaged cd's all in one, are so relaxing,they make you feel as though you are right on the beach,everglades,and surrounded by water,they are so awesome!!!"
4,Often Funny,"Good book, very funny and detailed. Read itafter listening to the interview on First Voice.The interview is online athttp://www.7to7.net/mcd.htmlThere's a transcript for those using dial up.--J. R."
5,We need more,"An incredibly detailed and fascinating look into the world of perhaps hollywood's greatest businessman ever. I wish there was more information about the great company mca and mr. wasserman, especially something sanctioned by him. there are libraries of info inside that man that we need to know!so far, we have added a tunafish lunch to our routine, a la lew. but we need more info, more books to balance this story. seems to me that bernard dick's ""city of light"" about universal pictures, ""stiffed"" and ""hit men"" about the music business and others offer snapshots from the whole film of the last mogul, but i would love to know more.respect to lew wasserman and dennis mcdougal."
1,Low Grade Hatchet Job,"The author has prejudged individuals and essentially uses anecdotes, gossip, and rumor to validate his prejudices. The author's descriptions, his uncritical acceptance of information that fits his preconceptions, and his attempts to create suspicions from seemingly innocuous facts, suggests that the matter is personal. As for the writing, the book is rambling, redundant, and generally poorly written. An excellent example of how a fascinating and riveting history can be made tiresome."
5,Mallowcups for Jimmy.,"This book never interested me. I stuck my little nosey up at it, not wanting to peer at someone's icky past and wade through all their dredged up pain. I read the book because a friend I respect read it. Her review startled me into reading it.What I discovered about Jim Bakker is that we have much in common. Short synopsis: Guy makes mistakes. Guy is in the pits. Guy discovers who God REALLY is.This story is about a man who made mistakes, not the ones we thought, but maybe the ones we are more familiar with. It's a beautiful story of redemption, of God redeeming the redeemed. This story is not only Jim's, but Billy Graham's and Billy's son, Franklin. They lined themselves up with Jim, like Jesus did with the woman who had somes stones coming to her.I had a rock or two in my hand before I picked up this book. Got no more rocks...but I do have some Mallowcups. I'd share 'em with you, Mr. Bakker, if I ever got the chance."
3,Compelling read,"Jim Bakker gives a compelling account of the events surrounding his notorious 'fall from grace' in the 1980s. He is entitled to be heard, and for the most part we can agree with him when he exposes the unfairness of the treatment he received at the hands of the media and the courts, as well as when he confesses, 'I was wrong.' He bravely recants on the prosperity doctrine he used to teach and provides an enlightening account of the process by which the Lord revealed to him the error he had fallen prey to.Perhaps the one area in which I would urge caution, however, is in the personal accusations he makes at the others involved in the PTL scandal. He alleges a number of things about other Christian leaders, as well as those closest to him, such as his ex-wife Tammy Faye. He may or may not be right, but let's remember he is just telling one side of the story. I wonder whether he was wise in putting some of these things into print."
5,Praise God!! He still takes care of His own.,What a wonderful reading of God's fullfilling His promise to us. Mr. Bakker admits to imperfections and that his growth is continual. I am so very glad that I read his book and am so thankful to Jim for writing it.I pray for he and his family a long and happy life. I am looking forward to learning of Mr. Bakker's continued growth in God's service. Such a blessing I have received by reading this book.God bless the BakkersTommy R. Gregory
5,"Thank you, Jim Bakker,now I know my brother's fears........","My brother is in prison and my family is still learning to deal with it. My brother read the book and felt that it was the only book that he has read that he can identify with. So I bought the book to get more of an understanding of his thoughts.It is as if he wrote it himself. This book is a must read for anyone who has a family member or friend that is incarcerated. I love my brother and I fear for his life, but Jim Bakker will help you realize that no matter what this mean and disgusting world has to offer us, that we can and shall overcome.....THANK-YOU-JIM-AND-GOD-BLESS-YOU!!!!!!!!!"
5,A truly great book!,This is truly a great book. You must read new book about Jim Bakker. Jim Bakker: Miscarriage of Justice by Professor James Albert
1,DISSAPPOINTED,"NEVER DID RECEIVE ITEM FROM SELLAR. DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED, DISSAPPOINTED."
3,"""I Was Wronged"" true title","I agree with one reviewer that this is the true message of the book. True repentance says ""I was wrong"" PERIOD. Not ""I was wrong BUT.........."" It reminds me of children doing mischief together but when they are caught, each one shifts the blame.I get the sense that Jim's greatest desire throughout the book is to receive pity from his readers and followers,not to state his fault in the whole matter.Man's first sin, eating the fruit in the Garden of Eden. Man's second sin? Shifting the blame!In case anyone is wondering, I love my Christian brothers and sisters and have been in full-time Christian work for over 30 years.I am just giving my evaluation of the book."
5,i was wrong,Was in the exact condition as posted. Arrived in a timely manner. Very pleased with the purchase and the provider.
3,Smells pretty but...,"But it doesn't last very long!!! You're lucky if it lasts 5 hours. I don't know if it is jsut the type of perfume it is, or maybe Amazon is selling a fake/imitation version of this thing. I was so thrilled to see that it's not nearly as expensive as the ones in stores like Macy's but it is NOT WORTH getting it from Amazon. I like most of the stuff I've purchased from here but not this one."
5,This book is about a man who lived a truly beautiful life.,"Lewis B. Puller, Jr. is an inspiring example to us all. His thoughts and feelings about the vietnam war and then coping with alcoholism portrayed in his book are truly beautiful. From reading Puller, Jr.'s autobiography a greater appreciation for the Vietnam Veterans, people in general, and so much more can be gained. This book is definitely worth more than the small amount of time it takes to read. Puller, Jr. has a captivating style of writing and will instill in you a desire to better understand the reality of war and the effects it has on people. Lewis B. Puller, Jr. wrote a beautiful book that teaches important lessons about life."
5,About time!,I have been teaching this material for several years and have finally found a book that tells it in a very excellent manner. It is of uttmost importance to the whole story to tell it with good research and evidence. It explains so much about the 3 days and 3 nights in the tomb. It is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the crucifixion in a greater way.
2,Lomo Super Sampler,"This 4 imageLomo camera is a lot of fun. Four images lined up together on one negative make an interesting format. The 'look' of the camera made many people think I was pointing a squirt gun at them! The speed choices are nice but I found myself using only the longer speed. Of course, it is frustrating not to have a real view finderbut simply aiming the camera made for some intersting shots. Personally, I wish the images were divided along the horizontal plane (panoramic) rather than the vertical plane. ....The film advance system and the exposure of each individual lens is inconsistent. In my camera the first image is underexposed by about a 1/2 of a stop and I believe that the film advance gears have already broken contributing to the advance problem. (I have only had the camera for one month.) Overall I would say this is a very expensive plastic toy that does not work well. I like the images but wish the camera worked consistently."
2,Junk,Might be worth [less money]. A toy at best. Paint chipped off almost immediately. You'll go thru a lot of film trying to get this camera to work. Shabby craftsmanship.
2,After a year an a half won't work,"When I brought this camera it was great, cool pictures, the size and look of the camera wasn't disappointed at all, but I have now 1 year and 7 months with it and it hasn't been working since a couple of month, first it started with lines on the screen and now it's a black screen and won't take a picture. I brought this camera because a friend of mine had it and I liked it very much, after I purchased it, another person liked it and brought it also, and now has the same situation as me, (started with the lines, and now it just work work).This camera its cool if you dont plan on having it for long, meaning, that you will upgrade it later, so if you want to have a cool, non expensive camara for about a year and a half, you can buy it."
3,Works great!....When it works!,"Bought this camera in September '03 and it was fantastic! I could put it in my jeans pocket and take it out with me everywhere on my travels. It took fantastic shots even in low light and the print quality was superior to some cameras even over 4 megapix. Disappointingly, it quit in the middle of my European Vacation in July '05 with a black screen that never went away. I can view the pix on the memory card but can't take any new pix.Sadly it seems that this problem is par for this camera. It dies about 2 years later. Be Warned!"
1,this camera is terrible,"i bought this camera only a year ago, and its been acting up ever since.- the battery life sucks. the matteries will only stay full for not even 30 minutes.- the LCD screen sucks. its beginning to change different colors, and blur occasionally.- the zoom--- very blurry.- and just recently it deleted all my pictures.i highly recommend not buying this product."
2,Not impressed,"I have several regrets with this purchase. From the fact that I listened to the sales person who was unknowledgeable about megapixels to the very unpridictable prints from this camera.Some come out ok but for the most part they are pretty bad. Very grainy. Even when printing 4 X 6. And if I can help with the Megapixel confusion, I've done alot of research on the matter since I bought this camera, and have found out a few things. The best place to start is http://electronics.howstu ffworks.com/digital- camera.htmHope this helps in your digital camera purchase"
3,Addendum,"I already submitted a comment about this book, but I forgot to mention one thing. I am not black, but I was still taken aback by Wagman's brief description of her only black character -- an attendant at a juice bar -- whose skin ""changed color as it moved under the juice bar lights, first purple, then blue, then a flat dark gunmetal gray. It was dangerous skin."" Yikes! Dangerous writing, if you ask me."
5,Layers of meaning,"SKIN DEEP offers some fascinating reflections onbeauty. The novel is layered with levels of meaning and significance that prompted me to pause and consider these layers and their meaning(s). It departs from a plot-driven story to become a mysterious, occasionally even scary interior journey of the central character, Martha, who reflects upon and talks about beauty, but who interestingly is never described or ""seen"" in the book. There is a ""mystery story"" quality to the novel at times, as well as a somewhat scary plot device that is especially thought-provoking. I am a Women's Studies professor, and plan to adopt this book for a course I'm teaching in the fall. I think it's written in a style that will appeal to today's college students, and it also provides lots of points of discussion and thought-puzzles to ponder. I highly recommend this beautiful novel!"
1,Disappointing,"From the reviews of this book, I was expecting a much more engaging book. The book was very disappointing. It was hard to care for any of the characters or to even understand their motives and behavior. Furthermore, Wagman's theories on beauty are trite and have been repeatedly written in a much better way in other works. I would not recommend this at all. I also did not like her writing style. Bump, however, another novel of hers, was a much better book."
4,It makes you think,"I really enjoyed this book. There were certain ideas that I would have left out if I were the author, such as the strange plot twist (if you read you know what I mean). Skin Deep made me question my own concept of beauty. I also surveyed many people about their own ideas and made it into a webpage. If you'd like to visit the site, please email me and I'll send you the url."
5,captivating look inside the heart and mind of a modern woman,"Martha lives alone inside her mind, where she's trying to work out our culture's fixation on outward appearances, on beauty. a former topless waitress and part-time mother, she answers an ad for someone to talk to. it turns out to be a plastic surgeon who has lost his sense of what beauty is, and he requires Martha to cover every inch of skin and body with blue sweatshirt material to talk to him. combined with Martha's affair with the gorgeous male body builder and her relationship with her daughter, Skin Deep is a haunting look at what it means to be a woman in today's image-obsessed world. the characters resonate for a long term after the book has been read"
5,Explores the issue of beauty with sensitivity and candor.,"I love this book. A slice-of-life tale about a divorced mother of one that faces issues of beauty in LA, a city so focused on youth and superficiality. Plus it contains an exciting element of mystery that makes SKIN DEEP hard to put down!"
4,Sensuous,A book which arouses the senses from page one to the end ~ shame that my imagination was not indulged further!
1,no solutions to exercises,There are no solutions to problems in this book. this makes it difficult to actually learn from the book.this is unusual
1,one star is way too much,"What a load of CRAP!!!Some shmuck puts a few still photos together and tells the story of run-dmc, not a good version of it, and videotapes interviews with a few select fans. There is VERY LITTLE actual footage of Run DMC...hence this is an unauthorized dvd. And when you do see them live on stage in front of a crowd, the music is dubbed over by some really crappy hiphop-instrumental.The explanation of JMJ's death is inaccurate, as per the reports we've heard. There's no explanation as to why DMC's not heard often on the Crown Royale cd, NOTHING WORTH KNOWING.The re-enactment of JMJ's death was very poor and cliche.Don't buy it! WAIT FOR A REAL ""anthology""-type dvd sanctioned by RUN and DMC! This dvd shuld have never seen the light or day."
1,Broke after 6 months,"I got this for Christmas and it stopped working after 6 months. I called the manufacturer (Koolatron) and they said it only has a 90 day warranty. When I said it's only been 6 months, they said that the refrigerator was from China, so it wasn't warrantied past 90 days. They offered that I could buy a new motor $30 or new AC adapter ($40). Don't buy this please. You can do a lot better without the hassle. I also had to buy a little thing that turned it on/off every night, so the total cost of this thing far outweighs its cuteness."
2,It looks cute but..........,"....A week after my son got this for Christmas it shut down, never to work again. It looks cool in his room and draws attention, but its appearance is the only thing going for it. We put an Ice pack on the shelf and it keeps things cool, not cold, but a least there is no Fire Hazard! If you want cute, buy it but don't have high expectations."
4,detail to a room,My son loves this.It adds detail to his room.His friends get a kick out of seen a huge coke can in my sons room
2,okay product,"It has a noisy hum and accummulates ice inside the cooler. But my son still likes it. As soon as it breaks, in the trash it goes."
2,cute but TINY!,This is nostalgic cute - but tiny & OVERPRICED. Why use the electricity on it? A picnic cooler can hold more!
3,OK,The item was ok The SHIPPING was a desaster. The box was not the box for the item to be shipped in. It came all messed up The Fridge was almost out of the box. I will be carefull in buying from amazon again.
2,waste of money,The cooler doesnt work that good the soda doesnt get that cold at all its not worth the money it would just b easier to put them in the ice box
3,A little heavy for kids,"Got this for our 7-year-old son for his birthday. It looks nice, but is a little heavy for him. He has some difficulty seeing out of the cage. As he grows, it may get better. But for now, he's happy just playing like he's Kenji Jojima of the Mariners."
3,"Not bad, just not so satisfying","Since it is in the series of Modern Marvels, I expect, at the beginning, to see the technology building the ball parks. It is, however, not what contents in this film. The main theme is the evolution of the ball parks from 19th century to the present. Of course, it is good to know why a ball park shapes like that, why is it situated at the outskirt of the city, and why it moves back to the heart of the city. Through the film, I just feel it misses something, perhaps many. For example, memorable moments, HOFers or teams with that park are worthy of mentioning.Like many DVD's of the THC, I always feel the running time is too short and I just grab the surface. This film is no exception. Every time when I begin to feel interested in what they mention, it just finishes and jumps to another. I'd like to see this topic addressed again in another DVD."
1,superficial in DVD form,"Basically, all this DVD is is the History Channel's ""Modern Marvels"" episode of Baseball Parks. That's it. No extras at all.You'd think with a juicy topic as this you'd get inside tours of ballparks, maybe some interviews with architects (hey, how about a whole featurette on HOK Sports which designed most of the retro ballparks of today?) even some photo galleries of ballparks.The show takes you up to the point where the San Francisco's Pac Bell (AT&T; or whatever they call it now) Park is in the building stages so it's not really all that up to date.A very poor release that adds zero to the original TV show broadcast."
2,Is that all there is?,"This film history is very incomplete particularly since it was made in 2005. It only began to whet my apetite for more, especially about the western US stadiums. It completely neglected to tell the story of Candlestick, Dodger Stadium, the LA Memorial Coliseum and Chase Field (the first that used retractable roofs so that real grass could be grown in an air conditioned space). This should be titled ""Eastern United States Baseball Parks""."
1,Hated It!!!,"I used to love the TV show In Living Color and they put it best about how I feel about this DVD set - ""Hated It!!!"" A complete waste of time. Everything except what is important is covered on these DVDs."
1,Give Me a Break,"This movie (or documentary) is American Arrogance, aren't ""All Men Created Equal""? Women are as well according to our Declaration, the claims of Therapists are not Science, but an open assault on Jeffersonianism. If one person is created with these oh...""Life Diseases"" (laughs), then we are not created Equal, and have not fulfilled any American ideals. Sorry."
4,Chemical Dependency,I feel it is a pretty good tool to help educate my patients who are chemically dependent. My patients seem to learn from it. If you work in the drug addiction field this video can be very useful.
2,Advertisement for the pharmaceutical industry,"I think this was funded by pharmaceutical companies to advertise their new products. It was shameful and misleading. I have a lot of experience with recovery, and I think this film was irresponsible in its approach. They made it seem like you could just take a pill and recover, and that is just not the case."
5,It was a nice find and this was much appreciated.,Thanks. This was more than expected. Will check it out again soon and lots of information in this DVD set.
5,I LOVE This Book!,"This book is GREAT! Not only do they do a good job describing the river, miles to do each section,identifying local drop-off/pick-up people, camping sites, etc., they have very useful MAPS that detail the access points for entry and exiting."
4,"McPherson on the ""Horizon""","I was not that familiar with alto saxophonist Charles McPherson until I picked up several of his OJC CDs in the cut-out bin at a local store. For those of you who don't know this underrated jazzman, he recorded a string of records for Prestige in the mid and late 60s, which are all being deleted (save one, his debut). This album from 1968 is one of his most adventurous and features a sextet of McPherson, Pat Martino on guitar, Nasir Hafiz on vibes, Cedar Walton on piano, Walter Booker on bass and Billy Higgins on drums. Take a chance and explore these ""Horizons"" while you can."
2,WAX!!!,"This set was good, but 3 things went wrong...1. On the backs of the sheathes, there are small protective caps, these all fell off, and i didn't touch my swords. I picked it up, put it to my side, and it fell. Same thing with the others.2. My blades rusted, for no reason at all, they rusted!!! This leads to the 3rd thing...3. The insides of the sheathes are made of wax!!! I belive this is what cuased the rusting. This makes it so that when you take out the sword, it looks like its covered in boogers. I tried to clean the blade, but it didnt work.(It also makes them smell really really bad!!!:( )"
1,Not what we thought,"We were looking for a book of songs that were designed to be played on a keyboard, but that is NOT what this is. We should have had more knowledge of music before ordering."
5,Excellent sea and sailing yarns,I read as many sea and sailing stories as I can get my hands on. This is one of the best. Read the other rave reviews here of this book--they pretty much say it all.I would just emphasize that this is one of the few contemporary sailing books that has a lot about sailing square rigged boats.Also an interesting twist is that Gann's Albatros is the boat that Sheldon lost in White Squall.
3,Attention !! Not compatible with PC Dvd Players !,This is the third time I buy this movie. Each time I couldnt run it on my PC. Finally I found out that this movie doesnt run on PC Dvd drivers like it is said on the back of the Dvd box. So be careful !!!
5,The Junkyard Dog,"This was the book I have been waiting for! Central Oregon winters give me a lot of time for reading and I have read a number of books this winter, but this one was a BOOK! I had a hard time putting it down. My mind raced through the whole book, thinking I had all the bad guys spotted only to find out I missed the boat. Well written and easy to read without superfluous rantings to slow things down.Can't wait for Mr. Wygant to give up another one."
5,It's really pumpin'!,This pump is just as described. It pumps more water that I was aware of before I got it. This is great because it keeps my little pond much cleaner!
5,Sunterra Fountain Pump,"After shopping at the Big Box stores and paying outrageous prices, I found this pump online. I ordered two because it was double the power and half the price. When the time comes, I will reorder."
3,Great pump while it works,"This pump works perfectly with the Sunterra Prefilter box. At first I was worried that this pump would not be strong enough for my pond, but I was wrong. This pump is very strong and is able to agitate my ponds water very well. Overall this pump is great for giving some water movement to your pond. If you want it to power a fountain I suppose it would be strong enough to do that as well.After having this pump for one year, it has finally stopped working as it used to. The impeller inside is starting to give up and will sometimes not work when the pump is submersed. I have tried to contact the Sunterra customer service but never received a response."
1,This one sucks!!!,I bought one of these at Home Depot and it was broken out of the box. The replacement worked good for 3 weeks and it's broken again. Don't buy this brand!
2,Not As Described. Good for Low Level Pumping Only.,"I take direct issue with this: ""the unit pumps up to 320 gallons of water per hour to a height of 8 feet.""I am pumping water from a reservoir and require it to be lifted roughly 7.5 feet. The above comments make this pump sound great because 320 gallons per hour at 8 feet would do the job I need.The reality, however, is that this pump can only RAISE the water to roughly 8 feet. At the 7.5 foot level, I was only able to get maybe 5 gal/hour out of the pump. This simply is not as described. If you need to pump water to the ~8 foot level, Seek Another Pump!"
2,"Tiny, not much power","I bought this along with one of the recommended items (fountain head set), but the pump doesn't have enough power to push water out the top-most fountain head. It just dribbles out. This pump seems like it's for a fish tank or something, not a pond or fountain. I'll definitely need a larger pump to move water up two feet and out the fountain head."
1,Disappointed buyer,"I purchased pump to run my aquaponics garden and the pump stopped working in a month. No help, no replacement."
4,Happy,Worked how I expected Good I am satisfiedThe pump was cheaper at Amazon because I could just buy it. I did not need the other parts that came with it at Lowe's because I was just replacing the pump that when up.
2,Sierra Dave,"Purchased the :extra large"" Sunterra 320 GPH pump for my 3 ft high water fall and 6 ft stream. When plugged in, the 320 GPH went down to approx. 100 GPH with a result of a pitiful waterfall flow. When I called Sunterra, they said that this ""extra large"" pump was not designed for this function and they could do nothing to help. Oh well, I had to eat this purchase. Yuck! The 1/2 PVC Sunterra tubing was also a big disappointment."
1,Don't buy this pump,"This pump is not very good. This one just died after 3 months of use. Sadly, I purchased another one and expect it will die too."
3,Not much water,I tried this pump and a Beckett 7060210 325 gph Submersible Pump for use on a small waterfall with a 6' rise. The Beckett seemed to have about twice the flow of the Sunterra. Both pumps arrived in good working order.
2,sunterra water feature pump not what i expected,"i am having difficulty with the sunterra 320 gph pump as it didn't come with the correct hose fittings and it is not the same as the picture on amazon at all - the front water flow opening is covered with a solid plastic shield not the grate like one pictured and the opening at the top is different as well.i had a sunterra pump that looked just like the pictured pump and it was bigger and alot more powerful. as i purchased it assembled from a garden center already in the stone water fall, the pump didn't have any specs on it.in order to replace the original pump i had to guess by looking at the picture i saw on the amazon ad page. the original pump burned out after a year...so i don't have high expectations of this one.i am going to gerry rig the fitting to the hose with duck tape and know better next time."
3,It's not a great book,"I had this book for my community health textbook. Comparing with other textbook, this book is really hard to understand. The author is trying hard enough to sound like a great researcher using jargons and difficult words to impress the public. As a student nurse, I would be much happier with a textbook that explains everything in laymans term. It's hard enough for us to understand the concept without those fancy words. A note for the authors, we like simple textbook not a complicated one. A complicated book is not necessarily a good book. In my opinion other textbooks are way better than this one."
2,"Good book, easy to understand","This series is very famous , and i like the methods and way they interprete."
2,Duchateau a poor teacher,"I have not read this book, but if it is anything like the author's previous attempts at writing it will leave you feeling angry. I read his advanced calculus book and it was awful. I found 16 mistakes on one page! This was the first book on advanced calculus I read and I was unable to follow the logic sequence. It wasn't until later after reading other books and mastering the subject that I discovered why. The examples were full of major errors. Not only that but he wastes a great deal of space repeating assumptions before each new section. As a result the actual material covered is sparse."
2,Not up to par with other Schaum's outlines on mathematics,"This is one of the more poorly written Schaum's outlines I have encountered. The theory is very murky and the author gives no clear direction as to where he is going with this material and what it all means. PDE is a hard enough subject without working a bunch of meaningless problems that leave you wondering what it is you are supposed to have learned. Instead, I suggest you read ""Introduction to Partial Differential Equations with Applications"" by Zachmanoglou and Thoe in order to understand the mathematical underpinnings of PDE. Then read ""Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers"" to get a thorough feel for how PDE is used to solve real-world problems. Both books usually sell used for under $10 each, making them cost-effective alternatives to this Schaum's outline."
2,Know Your Fourier Series,"Before you even think about opening this book, be sure that you know your Forurier series. The book uses that to solve most of the problems. Also, it is really not for those new to PDE. May be a good text for graduate students, but will confise the non-specialist. Not a good introductory text."
2,Not a text for beginners willing to know the fundamentals,"Unlike other books in the Schaum's series, this one passes wide out of the subject and the reader ends up not knowing what FE is all about. I read the book from cover to cover and still had no idea what all that math had to do with solving problems. Maybe a good summary for the advanced student, but not a text for beginners."
3,Some good proofs with some outdated material,"The reader should note that this book should be used only in an intermediate or in an advanced Partial Differential Equations course. This is not for the beginning student! That being said, there are some fine proofs in this text, but there is much useless numerical solutions of PDEs material using old computer languages that I did not find interesting. This book could use revision, but then again most other advanced PDE texts on the market are even worse! This book did help somewhat, but not as much as it could have."
3,Ehh,Doesn't correspond well to courses in PDEs if that's what you are looking for. Half the book is on numerical methods. I don't use it.
3,A good refresher book,"This is a good book to help clarify some of the methods you study in class. I don't think I would use this book on its own. Some of the topics covered in this book are qualitative behavior of solutions to elliptic and evolution equations, first-order equations, eigenfunction expansions and integral transforms (theories and applications), Green's functions, difference methods for equations (parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic), variational formulation of boundary value problems, variational approximation methods, and finite element method.There are examples that show you how to work a problem, and there are exercises to test your knowledge. Most of the answers are there. This is a helpful supplement, and I would recommend it."
1,Boring and annoying,"This movie was not at all what I expected. Its pretty much Bam complaining throughout the whole movie. I dont get how he can complain about being recognized when he is in the Lambo that has been in every single one of his shows and known by all his fans. Maybe next time he will drive something that no one knows is his. He complains about getting lost, not being able to get through the crowds (in the purple lambo), and he constantly complains about his car getting wrecked when it was being shipped. Just a whine fest and totally not worth a dime. Also it has some nice skating scenes, but mostly boring montages, and sucky music. BOO!"
3,It was okay....,"I am a HUGE fan of Jackass and Viva la Bam, I thought that this was going to be really good, and funny. But...it wasnt the greatest, don't get me wrong though it did have a few good parts I just wish it would have been a little better. I don't regret buying it, its still a good addition to my Jackass, Viva la Bam collection."
1,Boring,"this movie was two amatures driving a lambo having nothing else to spend there money on, movie has no plot"
1,Is it worth?,"I purchased this dvd on 08/20/09 and today we're 09/20/09, I haven't yet received it.... So I guess this says it all..."
3,Good enough for the price?,"Maybe. The jury is still out on this product. I bought this for my home office on the basis that my company uses the commercial Polycom commercial speakerphones all over the globe and those units seem to perform quite well no matter where in the world they happen to be deployed. The sound quality on the SE-225 seems sub-par, and the built-in headphone amplifier (I am using the top-of-the line Sennheiser CC540 headset) produces an audible hum even 25% of the headset volume setting."
2,Great when it works,"Wonderful quality speakerphone when it works. I have not found anything to compare. However, my first phone failed after 2 weeks - it would not hang up the line. My replacement phone lasted less than a week - no dial tone. I've just requested a 2nd replacement; if it doesn't last I'll be looking for something else."
2,disappointed,The microphone must be terrible. Others can not hear me very well as I've tried the phone on three different phone lines. The handset is very bad and not ergonomic. Don't buy this product if you need a business phone.
4,Outstanding Phone Set,Great home office phone. Speaker quality is good and as well with handset quality. Only minus is caller ID is difficult to read when on the phone.
4,Great product at a rather high price.,This is a great phone for office. But the price is a bit higher than it shoud be.
5,Nine years and counting,"I first purchased this phone in 2000 for my home office. After five years of daily use, I boxed it away during a renovation that took far too long. Recently, I dusted off this Polycom, plugged it into a IP-based line and it works, sounds and looks as good as ever. The speakerphone is still unmatched to products within the price range and the features, while dated, are fine for me. The voice clarity on the handset is exceptional.While I rely on an online application (Google Voice) for voice mail and call logs to maintain mobility, it's a nice feeling to have great sound quality while back at home. Most professionals -- especially consultants and other with home-based offices -- will greatly appreciate this phone. Typically, I would buy the newest and greatest thing available, but I'm fairly confident that I have it on my desk right now even if it is pushing a decade old."
2,Speaker hiss,"The main speaker for this product is always powered, so there is a constant low level hiss. Polycom was very prompt and sent out a replacement, which had the same problem. In a normal office environment, the hiss will blend into the white noise background."
3,Polycom phone,"The features are what I wanted, but I have some issues with the phone.People do say they can hear me crystal clear thru the speaker phone when I talk at in a normal voice. There is a buzzing issue though, if you wrap your phone cord around your hand it buzzes, strange but not a problem if you keep your arm and hand away from the wire.Jonathan"
2,Hardware quality,"The sound and ease of use is acceptable. The numbers on the keypads are unacceptably cheaply made it is now almost erased and not readable.After 1 year 2 months of daily use, the numbers are now almost erased. I wish that the quality of the number is high quality considering this is a commercial phone, i.e, not home phone use. It is geared for business heavy use and yet after a short while the numbers are hardly readable."
2,Not good for the long haul,"When I bought this phone about two years ago I was excited, expecting for the price that it would be a great speakerphone and have other good features.All during my phone usage people I talk to through the speakerphone say it's echo-ey. My my office may be a bad place for a speakerphone. Along with some other reviewers, I have found the volume too low.In the past year:The ringer on line one has stopped working,The hand set has stopped working,The headset has begun to squeak in a piecing tone.Overall, I'm in the market for a new phone, and this one is not on my list! Especially for the price--no way."
2,Needs more volume,"I bought this new from the Internet. It appears to be of solid construction, but has a poor sound amplifier. If you intend to use it in any kind of a moderate ambient noise environment, it's a bad buy."
1,Drops calls at radom and phne keypad numbers rub off,"Purchased this upscale phone for Home Office use. After a few months noticed calls would randomly drop and phone goes dead in the middle of a call. Also, and most annoying, is after 6 months of home office normal use (avg 5-8 calls a day), the numbers on the keypad wear off. So now I am looking at 12 (correction 11, the * key is still legible) all black buttons which makes dialing correctly a challenge. Hard to believe a phone this expensive would have cheap decals for numbers and no remedy. Called Polycom and they had no answer other than buy a new phone. NOT !!!!"
1,Poor Reliability,I read all the reviews about this phone not working and didn't believe it. Polycom speaker phones work great in businesses I've been to! Never tried a consumer one though and now after having it for 1 day am ready to return it. Got all the symptoms described in other posts... 1- Phone gets warm 2- Makes buzzing sound 3- Stops working completely. All buttons stop functioning until I unplug it and plug it back in again.Unfortunately the negative posts look like they are reality! I'm returning this piece of junk.
4,two & a half men 1 trough 7,"I purchased these used from Amazon and the Quality and savings were great. They are good as new, and i would do it again."
1,"show succeeds on single season DVDs, but fails as a boxed set","I have to say that I loved this show so much when I bought each season separately. All the episodes were great. Charlie Sheen is famous and I like that so I like the episodes and just watching them. When the box set came out, I sold all of my single season DVDs and bought it but now I do not like this show anymore so I recommend buying each season separately."
5,Some of the best crafted pop music of the 1970s,"Boz Scaggs, or this album in particular, is one of the enduring ""guitly pleasures"" of my misspent youth in the '70s... Now, I didn't own this album back then -- you didn't have to, since just about every track on here got tons of radio airplay, all through the disco era. It's whiteboy soul of the highest order -- slick, modern, immaculately produced but also soulful and sung with great passion. This 2007 reissue/remaster boasts wonderful sound quality as well as a trio of live tunes (""What Can I Say,"" ""Jump Street"" and ""It's Over"") recorded at a show in LA's the Greek Theater that demonstrate that Scaggs and ""Silk Degrees"" weren't just an in-the-studio phenomenon. One of the classic '70s albums that really stands up well over the decades."
5,So Much More than I Realized!,"Who knew Boz Scaggs had MORE songs as good as, if not better than, 'Lido Shuffle'? I leave it to the critics to decide if it's R&B, blue eyed soul or disco. Whatever label makes 'em happy! I get happy by simply listening to the music. A great example of the feel-good pop of the 70's, before everyone began carrying an enormous chip on their shoulder; it would be a real shame to see this album fade into utter obscurity. With our current diet of bland corporate mush, brought to you by advertising-engineered 'stars' like Spears, Lohan, Simpson et al, CDs like this shine even more brightly. It may be pop music, but it was TALENTED pop music, and that no longer seems to be a prerequisite."
5,"Still as good as it was ""back in the day""","I bought this CD to replace the cassette I had. Still one of the BEST albums, ever! Will see Boz Scaggs in concert (for the 1st time) in a few weeks, I can hardly wait!!"
2,An exercise in frivolity and fluff,Disco was not the only scourge of the 70's. The Dreamweaver and the likes of this man made for some sappy quasi-soft funk from which the industry is still recovering. I bought this album for twenty cents and do not like it. Buy a used turntable and do the same; save a buck or two.
4,Boz Skaggs - Silk Degrees,This is classic music that never goes out of style. Refreshing to hear at any age.
1,A Classic,"I was introduced to this album while in [..]and at upon first hearing I thought this was a black man singing. Man, was I surprised to see a white guy on the album cover; a testament to Boz's soulful style.Time has not diminished this great album. My personal favorite songs are ""Love Me Tomorrow,"" ""Lowdown"", and ""It's Over"" .Sorry about the confusion with the star rating. I meant to give the album five stars, not one."
5,Scaggs Rocks the Shack Once Again!,"Boz Scaggs comes up with the goods once more, and this time he does it with incredible style and silky-smoothness. From harsh chords to easy-listening, the Scaggsmeister manages to cover every base, making this surely his most noteworthy and influential collection of music released in his career as a solo singer to date (not including the Greatest Hits collection, which I must agree is the definitive Scaggs). Songs like the 'Lido Shuffle' and 'What Can I Say?' just make you wanna ROCK ALL NIGHT LONG! YEAH! What more is there to say? Boz Scaggs may have stopped recording songs, but he's left one hell of a stack of slammin' tunes. Avid Scaggs fans can quite simply ask for no more- Silk Degrees has it all (might I also add that 'What Can I Say' is absent from the Greatest Hits CD. Why?)."
5,Total classic,"I remember when ""What can I say"" and ""Lido Shuffle"" were released as a 7"" inch double-A sided single in 1976. Boz is the buz"" were the words across all his posters.Back then all the album tracks received airplay which helped shape this as the classic album it is today. From the feel good ""Lowdown"" to the catchy ""It's Over"" and ""Georgia"" this album is full of songs to get you up and dancing! Add some gorgeous ballads to balance it out ie. ""We're All Alone"".Follow up albums didn't fare as well but contained glimpses of Silk Degrees ie. the singles ""Hollywood"" and ""Breakdown Dead Ahead"".For anyone considering purchasing this album, you will not be disappointed."
5,STILL MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE ALBUM SINCE 1976,"A lot of credit must go to producer Joe Wissert and Boz's co-writer David Paich (leader of Toto) for this album's coherence, sonic brilliance and terrific musicianship. Every track is different from the previous one, yet it all fits together beautifully. The guest musicians reads like a who's who of top-notch L.A. session players, and the orchestra featured in ""We're All Alone"" must have cost Boz a small fortune - in fact, the total cost to put this album together must have totally freaked the suits at Columbia Records back in '76! I believe that this album's blue-eyed soul sound greatly influenced an up-and-coming Robert Palmer (see ""Double Fun"", another highly recommended album for fans of ""Silk Degrees""). My highest recommendation."
5,Silky Smooth,"Boz Scaggs' 1976 album, Silk Degrees, became the biggest hit of his career thanks to the super smooth ""Lowdown"". The song is heavenly slice of lush rhythms, finger popping grooves and silky vocals and peaked at number two in the fall of '76. But the album has more to offer than just ""Lowdown"". ""Lido Shuffle"" has a bouncy melody and great chorus and ""Georgia"" has some good guitar work. Mr. Scaggs can slow it down as well with the gorgeous ""We're All Alone"", which Rita Coolidge took to the top ten in 1977, and ""It's Over""."
5,silk degrees Boz scaggs,"I left this album(you can tell how old I am) in my car cassette player from Mar 17 2001 thru mar 17 2002. Never took it out. Tha greatest rock and roll song ever "" LOWDOWN"" Michael shimansky"
5,A Great Classic,"This is the only album that I have worn out as an 8 track, worn out as a cassette, and worn out as a CD. It is great. I love every song (OK... except Jump Street). Yes, if the current CD wears out, I have a backup!"
4,One of the better children's books about adoption,"Finally, a children's book about adoption that doesn't ignore the birthmother. The Mulberry Bird even puts her front and center, where she belongs--for after all, who makes adoption possible if not the birthmother?This book is realistic and well-done. The art is of high quality, and children seem to enjoy the story. The only improvement that could be made would be to somehow acknowledge that some adoptions are fully open."
3,Missing Pieces,"As a recent birthmother participating in an open adoption I ordered this story to read to my birthdaughter. Although parts of the story explain the adoption process quite well, I didn't like the allusion to the fact that the Mulberry Bird gave her baby up because of her own incompetence in caring for it. The only reference given to the birthfather was that ""he had flown off before the baby was born"". I don't like the idea of teaching adopted children that their birthfathers take off and their birthmothers are incompetent.This book was also extemely wordy and appropriate for older children only."
3,Not a happy adoption story,"I read this to my 5 year old girl last night. We both agreed that it was a sad story with an OK ending.To me it was an allegory of a homeless single mother, abandoned by her mate, heroically trying (and failing) to care for her baby. Parenthood overwhelms her.With the help of the kindly advisor (the owl), she is able to place the baby with another species of birds.This book probably would be most appropriate for older multi racial kids.After reading it my daughter says: ""Daddy I love you and Mommy so much and I never want to live with another family. I never want to be adopted""!!(Consequently, I thought it best that I didn't bring up the subject of her own birthmother, who she knows very well)!"
4,The Mulberry Bird,We read the original version to our adopted daughter until she was old enough to read it herself. She's now 22 yrs old and still calls this book her favorite book. It obviously struck a chord with her. Her adoption was a closed adoption---she's from Korea.

1,Nothing like Loudness,"If you liked Akira's playing in Loudness, then you'll hate this. There's no shredding at all, just a wimpy attempt at the Seattle sound.Don't waste your money!"
4,First time fears of home buying.,"For a novice like myself,interested in real estate the review I read made sence in that it gave commom sence information to the layman,about the dos and dont's ."
3,A scientific look..,"An in depth, scientific look at one of the most loved and most vilified plants on Earth. Understanding Marijuana helps you do just that."
3,"Not bad, but not great","Lots of info on the Spring framework, some good examples for Hibernate and iBATIS, but alot of repetition about why ejb's are bad and why Spring/other ""lightweight"" frameworks are good. Some arguments against ejb's are unconvincing: like they are too complex and hard to test. But on the whole if you're looking to get into Spring or are interested in Hibernate/iBATIS, or wonder what all the mumbling about inversion of control frameworks is about, then its worthwile."
1,Repeated materials from Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and De,"While the book is well written, many materials were already covered in Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development (Programmer to Programmer)The remaining 50% is mainly from the framework reference document and can be downloaded free from the project site."
2,NOT suitable for SE and developer,"It does not fit for Software Engineer or Developer at all. EJB has bad performance though, it is a well-known fact, no need to say lots on the point. This book is like an advertisement for Spring Framework, but no directly and clear outline of Spring. From beginning to end, the book wrote lots verbose concepts about java, no real touch of authentic content. Although Rod is famous and experience on Java, this book might be an artitechure knowledge book, not good for level below intermedia java developers and SEs."
3,The book needs an update,"This book introduces the Spring framework strategy as an alternative to J2EE which is GREAT. I noticed this book is far behind while comparing to the latest updates to Spring framework. Now, I am looking for updated code example and how-tos."
4,It's great!,"This brush has made my hair so soft. Plus, it's travel size so I can carry it in my purse without it taking up too much space."
3,Great Fast Service but ...,The Silver Aluminum Hard Case itself is durable but NOT some of it's parts. My husband works in construction and I thought this would be great ... but the clear plastic hard cover face is falling off because the glue isn't that strong and the side lock doesn't stay locked ... it opens too quickly. The Car adapter is perfect.
3,"Quick shipping, Hard to install","These blades came with no clear instructions, no diagram, and mostly in foreign languages. It took much too long to figure it out and even though they look the same as the ones they're replacing, I'm not even sure they work well now. Maybe that's because of my inexperience putting these things together. Once assembled, they did not clip well at all.If you know what you'r doing, ie; are a groomer or someone with lots of experience replacing blades on clippers, this was otherwise probably a good source."
3,A small-scale version,"These are not the meal replacement bars of this brand that I have purchased from other Web sites. These are high protein ""snack bars,"" with two-thirds the protein and two-thirds the calories of the meal replacement bars. Unfortunately, the images provided are so small that the type on the boxes and bars shown cannot be read. The labels and packaging are the same for the two sizes of bar; it's the unreadable type that distinguishes them. If I hadn't purchased this brand of bar many times before this, but never before from Amazon, I might have read the description given on Amazon's page and seen the difference. But since I was thoroughly familiar with the brand, I just looked at the images. Now I have snacks instead of meal replacements, for almost the same price as the larger bars sold elsewhere. Caveat emptor!"
1,buyer beware!,"I bought this fan a little less than a year ago from another online retailer. It wasn't that easy to put together but it looked cool after it was assembled and was actually quite powerful, yet quiet. The power switch/speed adjuster became loose over the short amount of time that I owned it and it eventually stopped working a few weeks ago. For the amount of money that I paid for this item, I had expected it to last a lot longer. Very disappointed."
3,An okay package,"I am a U2 fan, have been one since ""War"" and happily gobble up their CD's when they are released. The GH package from their first decade was fantastic...holding the required big hits, plus packaging a disc of B sides. This effort is more going through the motions.There are several huge hits on here, as well as soundtrack work that might have been great on another B side disc...but here they are all glommed into one. It's almost as if the band should have waited or dug deeper for material but figured something had to be released because of the passing of a decade.It's still U2...but a double disc live album would have been a better package."
4,A great collection of songs,"This is a good collection of songs from one of the best bands of all time. The new songs ""Electrical Storm"" and ""The Hands that Built America"" are excellent and the songs picked from Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Pop and All That You Can't Leave Behind are good. I like the remixes of the Pop songs but am dissapointed they left off ""Please"" and ""Last Night on Earth"". Is this a must have CD? No, not really... I would buy the other CD's instead but if you are looking for a good compilation this is worth buying. I wouldn't waste my money on buying the 2 CD set, the B-sides on disc 2 are mostly garbage."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I have just bought the US version of this album and am quite diasappointed. Where is The Fly? - one of my favourite U2 songs. I didn't buy it in the UK (where I'm from) as I thought I'd get it cheaper over here. Yes I did, but have now got an album with less songs than the UK version. I should have waited until I got back home. However, there are some great songs on there, e.g. Mysterious Ways, Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me and One."
3,a forced album?,"Not sure why U2 decided to put together this compilation but I suspect there was significant pressure from the record label. Why try to select only 14 songs (2 are new cuts) from their multiple records which have so many fantastic songs on them that were left out? I think I could burn a better ""Best Of"" myself on my computer...and are they really serious with the Batman track?"
2,"Missing songs, weak songs, unnecessary new songs...","To many song missing, instead we have some new song just to trick the fans into buying this CD. And lets face it, after Acthung Baby (excellent album!) the things aren't the same..."
5,U2 is so GOOD,"I love u2. Every song that they have wrote they make feel so good inside. All the songs have a great meaning, they make you feel so special."
3,Not the wisest track selection..,How can any U2 90's compilation leave out:- The Fly- Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses- Lemon- Elevation- Walk On- and perhaps... PleaseLeaving 6 singles off of an album that is a 'greatest hits' just doesn't make much sense! Perhaps Disc One should've been a 'greatest hits' while Disc Two (instead of silly remixes) could have been the band's personal favorites that weren't singles. This would've made for a more cohesive collection...
1,They dont move me,"They don't swing ..no soul , stiff , grating songs I guess that's why everybody likes them"
3,"As usual, good stuff but it could have been better","This compilation differs from the previous one in that there are more remixes of existing songs (though the one for Elevation is surprisingly missing, while the ones that were selected add nothing new to the tracks) and more selections from soundtracks. Like their ""Best of ... 1980-90"", there are songs that could've made the cut without compromising the quality of the album (i.e. The Fly, Ultraviolet, If God Will Send His Angels, Walk On) and songs that should've just been left on the scrap heap (Even Better Than The Real Thing, Mysterious Ways, Discotheque, Hold Me Thrill Me...). ""The First Time"" is a great choice to close the album though & I had yet to hear ""Miss Sarajevo"" or ""The Hands That Built America"", both of which it turns out are excellent songs in their own right. If I could I'd give it more 3.5 stars than 3, cause it's U2 after all."
2,Meh.. Unfulfilling..,"Ok, I love U2... I've grown up with them my whole life. But I just can't love this CD. Mysterious Ways and One are great songs, and so are Beautiful Day and Kill me.. I guess I'm most disappointed with the re-mixes of the songs from Pop. I for one liked that album a lot. The first half had some great songs on it, but the re-mixes are horrible. They hit the head of the nail with the 80's, but missed this time around. I'd still recommend the album though, its a good way to get a bunch of songs that were only done as singles on one disc."
1,"I can't call this compilation as ""Best Of""","Terrible, just terrible. Go and buy their most fantastic albums ever created, I mean, the experimental 90s era:Achtung Baby - Zooropa - Pop.If I were you, I wouldn't pay even 1 dollar to listen to those awful ""new mixes"" ( Discotheque, Staring At The Sun, Gone and Numb ). Go and listen to original versions instead !!. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Both Electrical Storm and The Hands That Built America are worthless, just filler singles - Hit and miss - in order to sell more copies of this shameful compilation.If you're a REAL U2 fan, you should buy those brilliant 90s albums instead, trust me, you won't be dissapointed at all."
2,stupid selection,"Much like the 1980-1990 retrospective, this collection suffers from a terrible selection of music. Key singles are missing while others are illogically offered in new mixes. Here is a better tracklisting for a collection like this. Note: all singles from the Pop album would appear in their original form as most people by this point have already resold the album to used record stores.The FlyMysterious WaysOneEven Better Than The Real ThingWho's Gonna Ride Your Wild HorsesNumbLemonStay Away (Faraway So Close)Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill MeDiscothequeStaring at the SunLast Night on EarthPleaseIf God Will Send His AngelsBeautiful Day"
3,THERE's SOMETHING MISSING....,"This is a good compilation from this period of U2 career...but i really gotta notice...Where is THE FLY????It's simply absurd this song is not here...Well, i really miss UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD and LEMON too...The truth is that ACHTUNG BABY, ZOOROPA and POP are great albuns, and many songs are missing...But this one got the beautiful MISS SARAJEVO, and the cool HOLD ME, THRILL ME, KISS ME...WOW! U2 is cool!"
5,u2 at thier best,i am a big u2 fan have all they have put out. this one puts the final touch on the u2 band wagon. these are some of the greatist songs by u2 you can get all together. covers all thier last albums through the decade 10 years of hard work and songs you can siong along with. it made my collection complete.
4,even better than the real thing,"Though this certainly ain't exhaustive, it proves to be an interesting collection of their songs that are rendered in an alternative, spirited and ""progressive"" form that makes for lots of listening pleasure. The beauty of U2 is that you can effectively take twenty or thirty of their songs, add a few variations (such as re-interpretations) and it makes for inspired, enlightened and enjoyable listening. So many site the previous twenty years as their creative zenith...but man, haven't they delivered some monumental goods in the past twenty!"
2,"Uno de los peores ""Best Of"" de la historia","No sé en realidad por qué llamarle a este disco ""Best Of"". ¿ lo mejor de qué ? me pregunto yo. Son 16 canciones, algunas de las cuales SÍ deben estar ahí ( One, Stay, Even Better Than The Real Thing, Mysterious Ways, etc ) pero otras simplemente sólo ocupan espacio y están de más ( Electrical Storm, The Hands That Built America - que aburrimiento de canción, otro cliché de U2 para homenajear a su Estados Unidos - The First Time, Until The End Of The World, y todos los ""new mix"" ). Pienso que este hubiera sido un Best Of infinitamente mejor:1- The Fly2- Even Better Than The Real Thing3- Mysterious Ways4- One5- Numb6- Lemon7- Stay ( faraway so close )8- Miss Sarajevo9- Hold Me Trill Me Kiss Me Kill Me10-Discotheque ( ORIGINAL )11-Staring At The Sun ( ORIGINAL )12-Last Night On Earth ( Single )13-Please ( Single )14-Beautiful Day15-Elevation16-Walk On"
1,"They can't even make a decent ""best of""","as bas as everything done since All That You Can't Leave Behind. I don't know what's going on in their minds, but I'm really worried. The last truly worth U2 song they made was Please ( both album and single versions ). Also that song was voted as the most significant song form Pop on the old www.u2.com ... where's this song ? I don't know.Do we need those spoiled ""new mixes"" ? No. U2 are going downhill but they don't even notice. The unmemorable U2 end has come, but they seem to be resting comfortably numb with sunglasses, cowboy hats, black clothes and all that crap.time to call a day, really. You are a shame U2."
3,incomplete,"this collection is very much like the first one. incomplete. where most greatest hits collections are missing 2-3 songs, this one is missing about half of what should have been here. like the previous set this one also should have been a 2 disc set. painfully incomplete. good thing i was able to make my own collection."
1,"is this a ""best of "" ?","fans were ripped off with this one. The cover art is such a beauty...but that's all. A beautiful cover art.why do we need those crappy ""new mixes"" ? Bono and his lads still think Pop is unfinished or whatever... so, so wrong. Pop is perfect as it is. So they wasted 4 songs from this ""best of"".The hands that pray for America ( new title ) is their worst cliché ever. Instant money and U.S charts for them.Where are Please, The Fly, Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, etc ?Ladies and gentlemen: don't get fooled. This is not a ""best of""."
1,Badly executed.,"This collection is so incredibly lousy that I can't even approach this disc without knowingin how badly developed this set is.The new mixes of the singles from ""Pop"" absolutely stink! I don't like ""Electrical Storm"" either.U2 are a great band but this second hits CD from them just fails on all fronts. Avoid at all costs and get their albums instead."
1,I can't take this 'Best of' seriously,"That 'Rest Of The Best' idea sounds more interesting than this poorly represented 'Best Of'. Many obvious standouts are missing, as 'Please', 'Lemon', 'The Fly', etc. To add insult to injury we also have an unforgivable doubling up of 'Discotheque', 'Staring At The Sun', 'Gone' and 'Numb'. Plus 2 blatant inclusions to attract the many U2 completists: 'Electrical Storm' and 'The Hands That Built America'.Buy their 90's statements instead: Achtung Baby, Zooropa and POP."
2,"Too many mixes, and some missings.",What's with all the mixes? Put the original studio versions instead and get some songs that were actually worth being there like Walk On for instinct.Altho its a lame Greatest Hits get the double album since the rockier version of Electrical Storm is there and it replaces all the flaws in general of this record.
3,3 Prophetic Science Fiction Novels of H. G. Wells,"I have not had a chance to read all three novels. I did get to read the Time Machine and found it satisfactory. It was shorter then I remember it to be when he read it during another period of my life. The book itself was in very good shape and I received it in a time manner. I will continue to order books and other merchanise through Amazon and it's particapting sellers.Respectfully,Micheal Taylor"
3,"Could have been much, much better . . .","I like various of this author's other books, but I'm sorry to say I couldn't get more than halfway into this one, at which point I gave up. The slow, almost plodding pace reminds me of Clifford Simak, but without the poetry. It's sort of an ""after the apocalypse"" story, but only one in ten thousand of the Earth's inhabitants don't welcome the end of the world as we know it. They'd rather have near-eternal life, even if it means fundamental changes in the meaning of ""humaness."" In fact, it's hard to see just what the handful of holdouts object to; most of them are loser-types and not typical of the species. But the real problem is that Wilson spends far too much time and energy developing minor characters, and the major characters aren't all that believable in their response to Contact. Hardly compelling reading, regardless of what Walter Miller's jacket blurb says."
1,Not practical for flowershop owners,"If you are a flowershop owner and want fresh ideas for your customers this is not the book you are looking for. There are not many greenhouse flowers you commonly find in flowershops. Most are simple, garden flowers."
2,Light and crisp...but too salty,"I normally enjoy all of the Kavli crispbreads and was really looking forward to trying this one. It's light, crispy, holds up well under heavier toppings such as vegetables, and is low calorie. However, I found this product to be too salty, even for a confirmed salt lover such as myself. The salty-garlic flavor can overwhelm many toppings, especially those already containing salt. A fresh, sliced tomato with herbs, no salt, is fine...adding a little salted hard cheese such as Parmesan decimates the flavor of the cheese. I ordered a subscription because the price was fantastic, but I'll be cancelling it and replacing it with another Kavli crispbread product."
2,SALTY!,"Crackers have great garlic taste, are nicely crisp, and are strong enough to hold up under toppings. They are, however, so salty that they actually hurt my lips and mouth! That can't be good for a person..."
3,Not a real fan,"I got these to use as a cracker substitute while eating low-carb. I bought the garlic flavor and they are VERY, VERY garlicky!! I find the garlic a bit overpowering. The texture of these is very fragile which makes it impossible to spread any type of cheese on them. I am working my way through the case but probably won't buy these again."
3,American DJ C-Clamp Medium-Duty C Clamp,"These are quite durable only downfall is bolt end which clamps has, no flat washer on end and marks whatever you fasten to"
3,No instructions. I Can't figure it out.,I still don't know how to use it. No instructions for an admitted novice in working with this type of item.
4,"Do what they need to do, but will carve up your truss.","These do exactly what they are made to do, and do it well. The only drawback to these is that they WILL carve up and dent your truss if you frequently setup and tear down your rig. O clamps are slightly more expensive, but are worth every dime if you want to prolong the life of your truss in a mobile or non-permanent setting."
1,get the ADJ o-clamp instead,"get the o-clamp from ADJ, you wont regret it. the o-clamp will not scrach up you tripod or truss and will be more secure."
5,You'll Love this Choice,"Delightful book, lots of large hook with 2 strands of yarn patterns, as well as mile-a-minute patterns. Easy to follow directions, and quite a few standard type patterns for the traditionalists among us. You won't be sorry if you purchase this one. All crochet."
3,Quick and Cozy Afghans,"This book is not for beginners. It has a great instruction guide which explains how to do the stitches, but the afghan instructions are more for advanced crocheters."
5,Airbags not included: You must take this ride,"The disk opens with a warning. A few lines of traditional Irish ballad worries seem to promise a nice bit of clomping about, but then ""The Sickbed of Cuchulain"" launches into a hell for leather death march through every drunkard's bacchanal ever. If, by the end of the song, you're not drunk or reaching for a bottle, you're a Puritan or deaf. However, ""Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash,"" thanks to Declan McManus's production, is an *album,* not a song or two.This disk functions as a whole entity. We have all the major themes of life represented, as well as updatings of all the traditional ballad themes. From the man of adventure to the expatriot's return to the defeated love, the record moves through phases of life, changing tempo and going from laughter to sentiment and back. ""If I Should Fall from Grace,"" the next album The Pogues put out, is fine, but ""Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash"" is perfect."
3,"It's no ""If I should Fall From Grace...""","I loved, and I mean LOVED the Pouges album ""If I Should Fall From Grace W/God"". To me it is one of the best albums I've ever heard. This one, on the other hand, was a disappointment. I was fully looking forward to more druken Irish wailing, but this one is more like it's recorded 3 hours after the pub has shut down, and everyones to drunk to walk. It seems to be more ballad oriented than ""this band and I are gonna come down there and kick your arse if ya dinna start dancin', laddie"". If you like sad slow songs, buy this album. If you like to dance and pretend you're getting in fights, get ""If I Should Fall From Grace""."
4,Gift,"Case arrived cracked, but probably happened through the mail. It is a gift, so the music is not for me."
5,Quintessential Pogues,"This album is the Pogues at their best. Every song is great, except for their cover of Eric Bogles' ""And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda"", which is bloody disgraceful. They must have felt they had to have a go at it, as it is one of the most often covered modern folk songs ever written (along with ""Dirty Old Town"", which is also done on ""Rum, Sodomy and the Lash"", and much more competently). The Bushrangers version of ""And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda"" is a much more sympathetic version.Anyway, apart from the above, this is a damn fine album."
3,"Good for the Tool Kit, but not a Stand-Alone Source","I found Hartzler & Henry's book to be a very good set of tools for leaders and members of virtual project teams. The content and exercises it includes are forthright and practical, and flow from good grounded theory and practical experience. It is published by the American Society for Quality, and so has a practical, quality & numbers bent.The drawback to the book, as I read it, was that it is a specialized book. It addresses project teams. It does not address leadership issues, technology, or ongoing (versus project-based) virtual teaming in any great detail. My partner found the text to be a little simplistic, but I felt that the writing level was clear and appropriate for technical project managers. I would not recommend it as a primer on virtual teams for executives. ;-)Recommendation: Buy it for your tool kit, but don't make it the only book on virtual teams you use. The authors have done a very good job on the topic they wanted to cover."
2,High School of the Dead Complete Collection,I had already watched this but wanted it for my home collection. I am not sure where it messes up but it does making the set incomplete
2,Not complete!,This product claims to be a complete collection. It is not true; it only contains half. The other half half of the tale has not been made or not been released.
5,simple masterful and well done to a fault!,"This anime blew me out of my socks. I have never seen a zombie flick match the mastery of this anime series. The characters are intense, the drama is top notch, the imagery is very haunting - this was made prior to the 9.3 earthquake(!) The musical score is... just wow! Yes, there is fan-service, and the inuendo is never ending... however, I have this in my collection and it is in the ""Masterpieces"" section.the downer is that with the success of season one, and the cult following it has,.. will there EVER be a second season, and the conclusion of the Manga turned anime series? The way things are going I may be really old before such a thing happens!!!... please if you are holding your breath - breathe! Because we may have to count this and the OAV (that should be released soon to the U.S.) as the only examples we have of the masterpiece of zombie films we have called, HOTD. But we can only hope..."
2,wow! really!?,"I don't feel the need to explain every ridiculous moment of this series so to sum it up for those interested in an honest review...WAY TOO MUCH FAN SERVICE!!! girls running around in their underwear as the world around them is collapsing to piles of rubble is utter madness!! To give credit where credit is due I'd have to mention the background animation was stunning. I enjoy massive gore in a zombie flick as much as the next horror fanatic but the humor and fan service totally tipped the scales and I personally lost interest mid-series. I appreciate that an anime zombie series was created, unfortunately it totally failed to keep me invested in the story or its characters."
4,awsome,"This DVD is beyond expectation of which all 12 episodes are found to be highly entertaining except that it heavily tests the sexual Desire of the male characters. The limit that this DVD caused people to see it was to be highly desired, except that it doesn't have the 15 minute short."
3,It was an action packed boob bouncing filled anime,"It was a little bit more of girl drama in most parts of it. Each girl fighting for the love of the main character. The action made the anime worth the buy but that was about it. If I had to rank this anime between a score of 1-10 (1 being the worse anime I ever saw and 10 being the best anime I have seen ever) I would rate it a 6, because of the relationship between Takashi and Rei, and the fact that this topic of a zombie ""flick"" is a more unique twist of the versions of most zombie films .In this one the most clear unique factor of it is that the zombies cannot see but can hear and move to the designated spot the sound came from. So to conclude this review, if you are into action then this anime is for you if you want a more unique zombie blood and guts anime or drama. BUY IF YOU CAN HANDLE THE BREAST AND BLOOD."
5,Must Have /16+ age,"Awesome...in the top 10 of my over 200+ anime's I own. Great Action, Well done characters, ...Little sexual ""worlds ending afterall"" Best take on a Zombie holocaust of any Movie.Buy this ...it's on the money all the way. Hope for seson 2."
4,"Scantily clad girls, zombies and assault rifles...good times","This is a fun anime about a group of high school kids who are pushed to edge of reason, humanity and character...all because of a zombie epidemic. It makes them question their beliefs, morals and each other. Good starting point for anime noobs. What would you do, or not do, if zombies took over your city?"
3,Zombie's and LOT'S of Fan service.,"High School of the Dead, Is a about a virus turning people into zombie's. The usual thing that happens when zombie's are in anime.What I really like about this anime is the adrenaline and fear you can feel while watching this anime. But I give it a three-star is cause i felt as if something was lackingin the story. Be aware though lot's and lot's and lot's of fan service I meant this anime should be rated R if it isn't. Some of the characters are surprising and some are a total cliche. Like the nurse. Also I don't know if there is gonna be a second season or not but If you buy this you're gonna hope for another season cause the ending leaves you hanging."
5,"Kick-butt, zombiriffic, slaughterfest","Sure, I've had my fill of zombiedom. Zombie this, zombie that. At first I thought ""Man, another living dead knock off."" It is, but as far as the genre goes, it's pretty darn good. The standard zombie rules apply, with some new twists. The guys are mostly natural zombie killers. The girls fall in to two classes: Brazier busting bazongas that are useless in a fight (bouncy eye candy) and Brazier busting bazongas that are phenomenal in a fight (even bouncier eye candy). Seriously.The zombie fight scenes are cool - this is Anime like Romero would do Anime. Most parts are pretty darn realistic, even if the girls are really, er, rhymes with twitchy. You really, really want to see a couple of them get killed off in the first couple of episodes, but things normalize around the fourth episode.If you like quality Anime with the requisite bust size and high-school based plots, this is a no braiiner."
5,A good zombie show,"Highs school of the dead is a very good show. And I feel that it is a zombie series done right. In the past few years zombies have been getting faster and stronger and I feel that HOTD goes back to a zombie that is strong and scary with out being too strong (like i feel that i can belive in HOTD's zombies, and still be scared of them). Also i like the vice acting in this show, it has its iffy moments, but as a whole the english cast did a good job."
4,YES and no bluray,"HOTD is a great amazing anime! If you like zombie movies then you will like HOTD. Some people say there is to much fanservice, but I couldn't really care. I like boobs! It didn't take or add anything to the anime. If you can get the blu ray, it looks great. The only down side to this anime is its way to short and the price is kind of high."
4,:3,This anime series is very good. It is an enjoyable experience. I recommend this anime for people who like ziombes and story.
5,Fantastic,I loved it. I have read the books and have seen the show on the web. But I had to have this. It was worth the wait.
5,High school of the dead,This anime is the best one and i love to watch it because it's about zombies! i would recommend this to anyone would loves anime and zombie killing
5,awesome anime,this anime is great came on time as for the movie awesome great action drama and fan service fan service great blu ray
3,Dax Riders - Back In Town,"Despite the Dax Riders being slight latecomers ""French touch"" period of the disco revivial, they try to keep themselves funky with their album _Back in Town_. ""Real Fonky Time"" goes for the funky electro but feels oddly listless. When the house rhythm kicks in with ""Midnight Underground,"" things perk up, even if ""You Are the Sunshine of My Life"" sounds like a vocodered Modjo track. Unfortunately, there's a good bit of forgettable house here until you reach the upbeat and melodic ""People."" Similarly, the thick emotion of the slower ""Don't Worry"" speaks louder than the generic floorfillers elsewhere on the album. I think more thoughfulness and less need to fit into a certain schema would have brought this album forward more."
5,"Funny, Sexy, A Delightful Book!","The Perfect Wife was a wonderful read. It was funny and sexy with a little bit of mystery. It is a fast read but ""hit the spot"" with me! Lynsay Sands has done a wonderful job balancing the different aspects of this book, the comic scenes had me laughing out loud and the sexy scenes left me wanting to read more! The main character, Avelyn is very real and it's easy to put yourself in her shoes. I really enjoyed reading about a woman who is found to be beautiful and sexy without being stick thin! I look forward to reading more from Sands! Definately time well spent, enjoy!"
1,Too Much Humiliation,"I had to stop reading this book because I couldn't stand all the humiliation that the heroine and hero had to suffer. Being ridden around camp bare arse-up in the air was bad enough, but the last straw was when they finally came together and ended up doing it in front of an audience on accident...ugh. I don't find humor in the humiliation of others. I stopped reading it and will avoid Lynsay Sands in the future if this book is a prime example of her work."
5,The Perfect Wife,"I enjoy all Lynsay Sands books. They are full of romance, history, action, and humor. I would recommend all of her books."
5,Best Book Ever ... Kept me Laughing,"I have read several of Lynsay Sands books and have never been disappointed, other than when they end. Her books always make me laugh out loud and there is enough suspense to make me wonder what will happen next. You will not be disappointed with this book. It is so worth the purchase."
2,Not one I would recomend,"(SPOILER ALERT!)Though I am a fan of Lyndsay Sands humerous novels, I personaly didn't enjoy this one. i found it too drawn out and tedious and frustrating. I know there are cruel people like Avelyn's cousins but I don't want to read about there constant demeaning of her. I wish she could have been a stronger heroine and put them in their place. Also the constant misunderstanding and miscommunication between hero and heroine did not make this an enjoyable read to me."
4,Enjoyable but predictable.,"A lighthearted romance, but not one of Ms. Sand's best. A predictable conclusion, and characters that weren't as well developed as those in her earlier books. Worth reading, but may be better as a library loan."
3,Merely OK,"Avalyn is an ample girl with an independent streak. Her parents contracted her in marriage to Paen, a battle weary night ready to settle down. Lucky for Avalyn, Paen likes his women with plenty of padding, and the two set out to build a life together.The crux of the story is these two people working to find balance in their marriage. It was an OK, rather easy read, that was lighthearted and fluffy. A subplot involving some intrigue sped the story along, but with no real mystery. I was hoping for a little more depth, however, which was lacking in this book. The dialogue read a little choppy, and the secondary characters were a parade of not very interesting maids, parents, and other relatives.Sands has a flair for the comedic, so there are a few scenes which are amusing. But they don't raise this work above 3 stars."
3,Not my fave but not bad,"I am a huge fan of Ms Sands Argeneau vampire series. Since I read all of those to date, I thought I'd fill in the wait with this book. It didn't grab me like her other books but it was a sweet medieval fairytale. Avelyn's naivete was refreshing and Paen's devotion was to be admired. The baddie was not hard to figure out but the ending did surprise me in some ways."
2,Something Missing,"I have read 2 other books by Lynsay Sands and they were OK, and it's the same with this one...just OK. It does have some comedic moments and those were the bright spots. Everything else was just plain dull. I can't quite put my finger on it but there's just something missing in this author's books. She writes well, but the characters are kind of boring and one dimensional. I will not be buying another of her books. I figure 3 tries is enough."
1,Sounds of...Music,"These recordings are relaxing -- but they are ""enhanced with music(?!)."" I found the music distracting. Based on the little information provided at this site concerning the contents of the CDs (there are three), I thought I was ordering nature sounds without music. If that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere."
3,Not for a novice?,"Bought this to fix my radiator since that's what nylon is suppose to be able to fix right? Well it did not work. I melted the nylon into the radiator mixing the rod with the radiator plastic. However it did not hold. I was able to scrape it off with a utility knife. And that was after reinstalled it back on the car, since it leaked. With the nylon scraped off, i used J B weld and it's still holding. Giving me plenty of time to order a new radiator. I also used the nylon on my headlight tab, and again it did not hold and fell off easily. Maybe i was using it wrong, but there was no instructions, and its not like i don't know how to plastic weld."
5,Great for a Lego party!,"Ordered these for our son's Lego-themed birthday party. They are not the typical Lego primary colors, rather pastel versions. The candies arrived earlier than expected and all were in good shape. They are pretty yummy too - reminded us of Sweet Tarts!"
3,Hard candy,Grandsons think these are good but Papa wonders if it is wise to have small kids learn to put legos..candy in mouth.
5,Hit of the Party,"I bought these for my son's lego themed party. Everyone (kids and adults) loved them. The kids loved building with them and eating them, and the parents loved the novelty of them. They taste good, like other reviewers have mentioned, kind of like a sweet tart."
2,hard and only 3 colors,"These candy blocks were much harder than others I have had; you can't even bite into them immediately without breaking your teeth. The bag was almost exclusively made up of yellow and green blocks with a few reds, no orange, white, or blues :( This is one of my favorite candies but I would not buy these again."
5,Love Them!,These edible Lego bricks were perfect for my 6 yr. olds birthday party! I gave a little bag of them to each kid and they loved them! They are easy to build with and taste delicious. Definitely glad I bought them!
5,Lego theme Party Candy....kids loved it!,"The kids at my son's 7th Birthday loved these sweet-tart flavored, stackable, Lego-like candies.My Son had a Lego themed B-day party and as the kids stragled in I sat them at the table and gave them a bag(labeled with names) of these block candies. They busied themselves with building and eating. When everyone arrived I set a timer and had them build the talest stack of candy they could by the time the buzzer went off. The party started off with the apparent Lego theme, an activity, a game, and leftovers for the goodie bag! Would buy them again....I did not buy from this company."
3,Good candy...,"I like these candy blocks. As it's stated in other reviews, the picture is misleading, there are no purple or white blocks. The bag I got was mostly green and yellow. I haven't found a single 1x2 block either."
2,Nice lego shape but not good taste.,"These candy blocks should be at least named as tarts, not candies. I expected them to be tasty but they are horrible in taste. I got them for my son's lego themed Birthday party, I think it's fun to use them because of their shape not taste."
5,Fun shower favor,"Used these for a lego-loving couple's bridal shower. They were a fun addition, and were definitely used for building! Didn't taste them, but someone mentioned they tasted like smarties..... delivery was very fast, and the candy was in excellent shape (not a lot of broken pieces)."
2,Too hard!!,These are really cute and fun but i could not use them at my sons 4th birthday party because they were too hard to give to the kids. It takes sucking on them for five minutes before you can even try to bite them. So now i have 2lbs of candy....
5,Shogun's One of the Best!,"Shogun, written by James Clavell is a great Japanese historical fiction. The book is filled with much information about how the past might have been. How Japan was hostile to foreigners, any kind of foreigner, since they wished to remain isolated from the world, how they thought mostly about honor, loyalty and death, just really how samurai thought back then. I liked the book because I love anime and manga. And since the book was based on Japanese culture, I decided to read it. The theme was quite mature, yet I ignored the inappropriate parts. The book went beyong my expectations and I was quite happy with the ending. How the war was solved and how I predicted it should have been."
5,Quite possiblly the best book ever,"This is my favorite book of all time, I love it. I find myself rereading in constantly. The character and plot development are near perfect in my opinion. You almost get to know the characters on a personal level. I've read my fair share of excellent books in my few years, however, this is my favorite; it's a real page turner. I know that it is a long book, but it's just one of those books that you can't put down after you start to read it.So just sit down, and start reading, trust me, you won't be able to stop. The book really is that good."
5,The Best Japanese Novel Ever Made,I'm only fourteen and I read the whole book. Mr. Clavell's writing style kept me from putting the book down. This story is probably the perfect sumarization of Feudal Japan in a awesome story. Now I feel like going to the library to learn some Japanese History.
5,Short review for a long book!,"I remember reading this book when it first made it into paperback. I was completely hooked and forgot to eat, drink, or sleep for the entire time it took to read--and it's a long read. On re-reading this time, it was almost as good, although I don't think it can ever get the juices flowing the way it did the first time. This book may not ever make it into the pantheon of the greats, but it is possibly the best no-kidding read I've ever had. Only ""Gone with the Wind"" equalled it in un-put-downableness. I always recommend it to people who don't read (really, I meet these strange creatures all the time), as an intro to how wonderful reading can be. One day, I shall make a convert."
5,an epic tale....,....of love and intrigue in ancient Japan. Well-drawn characters and a complex plot.
2,Disappointed,After waiting several weeks to get the book I was disappointed to see the hardcover was a small edition which was not stated in the offering. The print is almosr as small as a soft covered book and since this is a long book I was looking foward to luxuriating in reading a book that would not strain my eyes.
4,WORTH UR TIME,"Read this a long time ago, but have to say great auther and amazing book. Certainly worth the time, patience, and focus u prob need to read it. Let me know what u think. Enjoy the book...drew. By the way this is not my fav author...there are certinaly much better. However, he is great if u can focus really well...lol. Drew"
4,Always good,I really enjoyed it years ago when I read it. It is still just as good--only the medium has changed--Kindle. Works well on Kindle.
3,"Ah, disapointment bitter","My father never gets to read books. When he does, he takes this old battered copy of Shogun and reads it, reareads it, immersing itself in it: you know, like the old saying about the difference between good books and great: the great you want to visit again and again.So perhaps it was with too many expectations that I started reading this book. But when you finish reading, you have to admit that though the boundries are great, saga-like, the story doesn't manage to fill this great framework, and from the middle on it tends to be long and frustrating; that although the Japanese philosophy is intriguing, the harsh rules everyone seem to act by leave no room for real, burning emotions, and lusts you can identify with--see that pale love story; that though I personaly came out wanting, wishing, dying to know more of these affairs (which are, my dad claims, REAL,) I would certainly not read Shogun again."
1,Very Unhappy,This was advertised as Vol. 1 and 2. I only received Vol. 1. I haven't located the proper way to contact somebody about this problem.
4,Shogun is a complicated saga of love and death in Japan.,"I throughly enjoyed every minute I spent reading Shogun. The Japanese culture is portrayed in a way that the most ignorant reader may feel connected to the characters and and be drawn into the book. Shogun is one of the best historical novels I have read. The most distinguishing aspect of the book are the detailed descriptions of each and every character. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes to get a full circle story. Lastly, Shogun is not for the tender-hearted."
5,The greatest adventure in Fuedal Japan,"This book has come to be known as one of the greatest fictional adventur estories of all time. It tells of a foreigner to Japen, a man known as Blackthorne whose fleet is shipwrecked off the coast of Japan. Taken in by the natives, Blackthorne becomes assimilated in Japanese society, only to learn of the power and deciet of the country. It is a tale of backstabbing and power hungry lords that scavange the land in search of anything they can get thier hands on. Blackthorne witnesess firsthand, the beauty, terror, and power of the country called Japan in an era of war. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys a good adventure tale."
5,The Novel to end all Novels,"James Clavell masterfully recreates the genre of feudal Japan in the days of Warriors and Peasants when the outside influences of Western civilization began to seep its way into the previously untouched land of teh rising sun. Clavells ability to create character development and interplay is nearly unmatched, and his talent for creating a highly interesting, adventurous, and vivid setting entraps the reader into a time long since past but not forgotten. The plot, character development / interplay, setting description, flow, writing style, and depth make this book a masterpiece. This book has it all...love, romance, intrique, war, politics, religion, honor, death, loyaly, and betrayal. I highly recommend this book to anyone!"
4,Sweeping Epic of Historic Japan,"This novel only covers a time span of about 2 years if you exclude brief flashbacks, but it is otherwise epic in its scope. There's many classic themes combined in this one giant book (over 1000 pages in 2 volumes). It starts with the ""Fish out of water"" theme, which can be taken almost literally in the case of the main protagonist, an English sailor most at home on the ocean who is stranded in Japan not long after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in the reign of Elizabeth I. While I can't vouch for the accuracy of the cultural descriptions, they are fascinating nonetheless. Also, if there's a book written in English that contains more ritual suicides, I'm not aware of it. It also touches on themes of forbidden love, religious intolerance, racism, loyalty. I found it to be a page turner and a quick read in spite of its length."
4,Characters,"I knew very little about Japanese Hiftory or culture and fond this aspect absorbing, I found the large number of fcharacters with difficult names irritating at first until I realised you only had to remember the main protagoinists who are brilliantly portrayed, I thought.And don't try to keep up with the complicated details of their war strategiesl"
5,Shogun,I have read this book many times and it was falling apart. What a find that I could get it on the kindle.Have just reread it again and it was as good as the first time.
4,An Old but Great Peep into Samurai culture,"An English pilot in a Dutch vessel after an epic voyage goes aground in the Japans in the 16th Century. A huge clash of cultures is woven into the text: English and Japanese samurai culture, (Gaijin - Barbarian in the Land of the Gods). Portugese and Spanish mercantile interests, suave Jesuits and unclean Spanish Franciscans, a powerful samurai leader and his clever planned steps to the Shogunate, overall ruler and military leader of Japan. Also the clash between the Japanese culture of honourable Death and the European clutch on Life. And this is all woven around a love story between the Anjin-san (the renamed English pilot) and Mariko-sama the beautiful high-born Japanese woman.A really clever, superbly integrated story with multiple parallel themes. But it is complex so it is not a book for the faint-hearted, but I do believe it is the best of Clavell's Asian novels."
5,Life-changing.,"Yesterday, I finished Shogun. Today, I just purchased a tour package to Kyoto and Osaka, Japan for my wife and myself. It's that good."
5,A great tale,"I gets convuluted along the way, but when I first read it, I couldn't put it down. I think I read it a 2 or 3 days. The mini-series didn't do it justice. You've probably read the synopsis and other reviews, so I won't elaborate."
5,Shogun is awesome,The book Shogun by James Clavell is about an English pilot(Blackthorne) who shipwrecks off the coast of Japan. This takes place during the 1600's and is during the time of the war between the allied England and Dutch vs. Portuguese and Spainish. He is slowly taken into their culture and comes to a sort of understanding with the Japanese. He is taken in by a daimyo known as Toranaga and during this time saves the daimyo's life several times prompting Toranaga to promote Blackthorne to a samurai. He is also given the role as a minor daimyo and he is instructed in the ways of bushido and learns a little of their language. He also uses his knowledge to instruct a gun battalion to fight a rival daimyo. Using Blackthorne's unique knowledge Toranaga prepares for a war. Blackthorne in turn witnesses some amazing events and experiences amazing culture. I recommend this book to others and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
5,Amazing!,"I can't say enough good things about this book, it is absolutely fantastic. I didn't want the book to end, even after 1200 pages! This is one of the best books I have ever read."
5,Great start to an amazing saga,I had read Noble House years ago and decided to start the entire series from the beginning. A week later I'm dying to get Tai Pan in front of me.
5,Classic Historical Fiction,"Clavell does an excellent job in providing the reader an idea of what Japanese history and culture were like. The book mirrors the warrior atmosphere in Japan while the Europeans searched for new lands to claim.The honor of the Japanese, their strict traditions, and fierce battles are well depicted. To mix all of these into a love story is magnificent. This is a thriller, sad story, and historic novel all in one."
5,An old favorite...,"This is a good novel, in that it's a well researched, well plotted and well told tale. It's good and long, it holds the attention, and it holds up over re-readings."
4,ancient Japanese culture,"One day, I remembered old film whose title was SHOGUN. This film was broadcasted on TV as well before. I was attracted ancient Japanese culture thru this film.So, that is the reason why I bought this book. The story of this book is actually same as filme's. So fabulous."
4,"Really Good, not great","This book was a very worthwhile read, almost worthy of a 5 star rating. There are two reasons for a 4 star rating: one, there are parts of the book that are slow (although I guess that's to be expected in a 1,000 page novel!); second, the ending is just not good enough for such a great book. There's just so much detail in the first 990 pages that the ending seems rushed - almost as if Clavell or his author decided that the book simply had to be less than 1,000 pages and they couldn't cut from anywhere else. With all that said, I am glad that I read the book and I would recommend it to anybody that enjoys fiction."
5,Life-changing drama,"I first read Shogun in 6th grade after seeing a re-run of the TV mini-series. Although the first motivation for reading this was satisfying my language arts reading requirement -- at nearly 1,200 pages, this one book was all I needed for a whole quarter! -- this book ended up changing my life. Not only was Shogun a lot to chew on in terms of its vocabulary and subject matter, but its detailed descriptions of Medieval Japanese culture and omniscient narrative voice taught me that the world I experience is a subjective world and that each culture and each individual has his or her own perspective."
5,Absolutely entertaining,"This book is spectacular. And so not to spoil anything, I will say that it's worth every cent. This book has many intricate plot lines and when you begin getting bored (there are scenes with rather dense dialogue at times) something new and exciting always pops up. Such as lots of talk and then ""suddenly on the horizon there was a brilliant fire..."" etc., etc.,This book is a great beach book and also it's longer than Les Miserables (which I have also read) this book is easy to fly through. I highly recommend it for ages 13+.Beware parents if you don't want your kids exposed to gore or sex too soon, but other than that, this book is definitely for all."
4,The ending will disappoint.,"Just finished this book a few days ago. I wanted to digest it completely before commenting. Overall it is a superb book. Character development is a good as it gets. Descriptive narative is fantastic, painting vidid pictures in your mind as you read. Plot moves along with twists and turns. However, what left me disappointed was the ending. After having invested a thousand plus pages of reading I was hoping for more. The author must've realized that he had gone on too long with the overall build up and decided to cut short the impending battle. Disappointing to say the least, but was glad to finally have conquered this book. Dive into this story with gusto but be warned you might feel slighted in the end."
4,Shogun - a great classic,This is one of the all time great reads especially if you have every visited Japan. The book accurately captures the complexity of the Japanese psyche and gives an excellent insight into the great honour that is inheirant to the Japanese. I first read this book 30 years ago and it is still a wonderful book. I have been fortunate to visit the National monument that is the grave of Anjin-san and his Japanese wife just outside Yokosuka in the prefecture that he governed.
5,"""Is this the Japans????""","Epic tale of a seafaring Englishman who gets shipwrecked in 17th century feudal Japan and caught up in the local struggles and intrigues. This is very entertaining, and the miniseries is worth checking out too."
2,Had potential..,"The book started out with potential but I got bored. Way too much time given to scenes that go nowhere and add nothing to the story. And full of lazy dialogue 'he said.. she said.. he said.. then he said...' Man it was like reading a script, not a novel. I stopped reading 1/3 way through and started on Life of Pi instead (excellent book by the way). Life's too short to read crap books."
2,a grand disappointment,"Before embarking on these 1100 torturous pages, be warned that though this may be an epic, is is certainly not a classic. The writing is very turgid and, what's worse, irritating as hell! I lost count how many times the word 'truculent' - obviously Clavell's favorite adjective - was used The direct translation of Blackthorne's broken Japanese is irritating and, as others have pointed out, just plain wrong. And please, scrap the one sentence description of every character we meet along the way....""he had three teeth and leathery skin""....""buck teeth and bulging eyes""....blah blah....believe me, it'll drive you nuts.Life's short and time is precious - don't waste it on this bloated monstrosity."
2,What's the deal?,"The Tom Clancy of the 70's. This book is so overwritten it hurts. Racist beyond belief, I should add. The philosophy is supermarket tabloid stuff. This sucked."
1,Drivel...utter drivel,"I enjoyed this book, until I reached page 350, and realized that there were 800 pages to go and I knew exactly where the book would end up. I'm taking a class on the politics of Feudal Japan, and we discuss this book at length.Leaving Clavell's gross inaccuracies aside, we still have the fact that this is a rather poorly written work. One can tell that Clavell is trying to throw underlying themes and messages into the mix, but they're thinly veiled.If you're interested in good historical fiction, I urge you to invest your time into a better-written title, such as ""Carter Beats the Devil.""Leave this one on the shelf, save the 8 bucks."
1,inadequately researched and poorly-written,"This book has many historical inaccuracies. The writing is gripping like any best-seller should be, but does not have the literary quality to make it a work of art. The language used is as simplistic as a sixth-grader's, and does not use this to any advantage other than making it very easy to read for the unintelligent masses."
1,Shogun the book is a waste...Shogun the TV Movie a gem,"I was first introduced to Shogun via the TV mini-series. It is a gem. Usually the book is even better than the media version. Not so. The book is full of cursing & trash talk. It is tedious in plot and story development. The only saving part of the book is the addendum page (yes, just 1) that ""completes"" the Shogun saga.Avoid the book, buy the DVD version of the story - interesting, entertaining, educational and well crafted."
2,Turns the scriptures into rubber...,After studying more I now agree with all the teachings about the Virgin in this book.I was brought up Protestant and taught nothing about Mary and how she is Mother of God and Bride.I didn't get it.Took me a few years now and I've switched from the 66 book Protestant bible to the 76 book orthodox/catholic bible and read the Catholic Catechism in its entirety finally.I had a lot of catching up to do.Excellent book.Theotokos.
3,SILLY BUT FUN,"HALLOWED GROUND reminded me of some of those horror films from the seventies where a young girl must free herself from religious fanatics and the spirit of a crazed minister who is inhabiting a scarecrow. Jaime Alexander (REST STOP) plays Liz, a young girl just out of a failed relationship whose car breaks down in a town called Hope. She pairs up with reporter Hudson Leick who tells her the town's sinister history and invites her to go to the farm of the evil minister; that's when the horror begins.The movie's pacing is quite quick and it has an ominous air to it. Not a classic, but far above many of the SAW IMITATIONS and torture flicks glutting the market."
2,"Not terrible, but nothing new","Hallowed Ground is one of those quasi-religious horror yarns that you've seen before in different iterations, meaning you're not getting anything new here, but then again, you probably already knew that. Jaimie Alexander (Rest Stop) stars as Liz, a girl on the run from her past that winds up in a small town, and learns that she well may be part of a prophecy involving the resurrection and rebirth of the town's demonic old preacher (a briefly seen, scenery-chewing Nick Chinlund). Taking many cues from Children of the Corn and its ilk, Hallowed Ground isn't anything terrible in the least, but as said before, it isn't anything you haven't seen before either. The acting isn't completely horrible (which is a nice change of pace), but the effects work is pretty bad in itself. Either way, you probably know what you're getting into with Hallowed Ground, so don't say you weren't warned."
2,Poor (beautiful) me!,"An interesting thing happens when people write memoirs of terrible things that happened to them: readers are afraid to say anything bad about the books themselves, because it looks like they're being unsympathetic towards the tragedies described. I felt for Dani Shapiro when her father died, but without that incident, this reads like the work of a self-obsessed rich b*tch who epitomizes solopsism: nothing in the world matters to her but her own experience and what people think of her. It is very important, by the way, that you think she is beautiful, as she reminds you constantly throughout the book. That, to me, is the quality of someone who hasn't quite worked out her own problems--someone who is sadly aware of how she acts and says and what you think of her as a result--and someone who is probably not completely honest with you, dear reader, because the ugly parts of her--the ones for which you won't feel sorry for her--are most likely omitted."
2,"pretentious, cry baby","I read this in a women's lit class, I did not enjoy it at all. I found her to be a whiny, spoiled crybaby who refused to take any responsibility for her life and her decisions."
4,"Great reading, it was hard to put it down!","I heard excerpts of Dani's book on public radio. I caught the middle of the review and did not realize that it was an autobiography. When the interview concluded, I knew I had to get the book. It was great reading and unbelievably moving. This was a young woman caught up in a very destuctive relationship with an older, wealthy and very controlling man. I was embarrassed for Dani for her honesty and intimate details of her affair. Would recommend the book very highly. However, I bought another one of Dani's books (Picturing the Wreck) and was dissappointed. Maybe the next book I buy will be better reading."
2,For once fiction might be better than the truth,"I picked up this book hoping to find out about some character development of an orthodox jewish woman, but found it to be rather superficial and meaningless. The only reference to ortodox practice was on her father's side. I didn't really get inspired or feel empathy for the young woman's circumstances. Overall, it wasn't one of the best memoirs I've read."
3,Our Second Book Club Selection,"I selected this title for our Reading Club. The book's description caught my attention as I was looking for a selection with a real ""change of pace"" appeal. Shapiro definitely delivered on that note. The selection was an easy read with a ""not-so-easy"" topic. Having recently lost a father, I identified tremendously with her and actually relived some of my rooted pain. I rated the book however, with only three stars as I felt she underdeveloped central characters in the book that if made more of would have delivered a richer piece of fiction. I was left unsure if this was her intention, or just her subjective view of the character. Overall a decent read. I will at least check out some of her other works."
1,Party on the mental ward,This movie is a piece of you know what.This is surprising since it must have cost at least $5000.00 to make.The movie is so bad I turned it off even before the ending because I just didn't care anymore.It stars the guy from terminator 3 . How this guy is making movies I just can't figure out since he has little talent and no screen presence. He looks like the guy changing your oil who goes to AA four times a week.This all takes place in a mental ward and the characters are amazingly boring but I guess they match the story.Avoid this flick at all costs even if you can watch it for free.
2,ON THE INSIDE,"I watch movies to laugh, be scared, sometimes even enjoying the dark and twisted movies. I also watch movie to escape from everyday hard core reality. So this is why I can only give this movie 2 stars. I want a wrapped up good ending, and although there was a twist at the end, I found it only enhanced the hard core reality of everyday living. So without giving the plot away I will leave it at that."
4,Buy for the Movie Not the Stooges,"A surprisingly good movie. Disreputable dancer becomes star. Joan Crawford seen as a dancer, not as a dark character as portrayed in her later films. Also the First film of Fred Astaire. Other future stars can be spotted, for instance Eve Arden (Palmolive lady, Grease,etc...) Ted Healy and the Stooges really have a limited role, nevertheless an enjoyable film to watch."
5,Deserves the raves,"This was an unknown treasure, made the year my parents were born.Joan Crawford was so fresh and appealing before her campy older movies. Clark Gable was always hot--I think he made ""It happened one night"" the same year. But for me Franchot Tone stole the show.Star and sex appeal that just doesn't quit. I was rooting for him to get the girl, even knowing it wasn't going to happen. More handesome and sophisticated than Gable. Who'd have thought?"
3,Glacier National Park in Canada,"Note that the Glacier National Park mentioned in this book is in Canada, not the United States."
4,Excellent story with and unusual twist.,Definately one of the better books I've read.The author manages to mix computer and bio technology intoa gripping story line.This book will grab you and be very difficult to put down.
4,a lace-work of words,"Labyrinth is like a lace-work of words. It's definitely surreal, and there are explosions of paragraphs that describe nothing so much as madness. It a story of a quest that isn't, a journey to a center that's not there. It's slightly insane and cyclical, but it's beautifully wrought. The plot is certainly secondary to the tale-telling, and the times that the book drops out of the narrator's head and dips into dialogue serve as resting points for your sensory-overloaded brain. At times, it can be a little bit hard to slog through the metaphors and find the meaning behind it, but it's rewarding in the end."
5,Update for the Boom Town DVD by Rags to Riches Reviewer,"The new DVD sharpens the film up considerably. The Theatrical Trailer is included along with a cartoon and Hollywood short that don't have much of anything to do with this great film. As before, I mentioned that I had hoped that all the film would be put back together and although this is a little better there is still some cutting, including the Oklahoma Indian Land Deal Peace Pipe smoking scene which is still missing here. This film was the biggest money maker in 1940. It won an academy award for special effects and deserved it. Why can't we have the whole production on film? Anyway, I still recommend the film for entertainment value. They don't make films for pure fun anymore but this was one of them."
5,Classic Gable and Tracy,"Great old movie.This is one of m favorite movies ever.A great story,that is still good toady.My 24 year old son loved it too.A timeless classic!!"
3,"Good info, but no pictures!","I appreciate knowing what kinds of birds are where, but I need to be able to identify them. So, I will have to find another book with pictures to help me out."
1,"No pictures,no illustrations,no descriptions",This book tells where along the North Carolina coast that you might see listed birds and what time of year. I suuppose if you knew all the birds and there characteristics it might help you get around the areas.
1,Mine died after 18 months,"Phone worked great for 18 months. Great conference (full duplex). Nice sound quality.However, the LCD screen went out after 18 months for no reason. Just blank. Phone still works, but cant see who's calling or any info. Now I'm out of luck and searching for a replacement."
4,Very Good Speaker Phone,"I have just received and set up the phone. It is exactly what I expected from Polycom. The initial calls were clear and the other attendees did not even realize I was on a speaker phone.I do agree with other reviews that the inability to adjust or silence the volume on the dialing beeps is annoying. Not only is it not adjustable, but it is VERY loud.Otherwise - the phone is perfect for my home office."
1,Ugly-ass phone design,"This is one of the UGLIEST looking phones I have ever seen. Not only is it aesthetically unappealing, it is functional non-ergonomic. The display is not angled toward the user--the display is hard to see if the phone is at arms reach away.Poor design--for a phone that costs this much."
4,Great value for the money,The Polycom Soundpoint Pro is a good value for the price. I run a business out of my home and need to be able to project a professional image to my clients. Some of the less expensive phones I tried sounded cheap and tinny like you were talking in an echo chamber. Polycom scaled down their corporate conference phone to maintain the features and performance but at an affordable price. The sound quality is clear with a minimum of clipping. No complaints from the clients about not being able to hear me clearly when using the speakerphone. I'm very happy with the performance of this product.
2,El Stinko,"This phone simply stinks. I have had nothing but problems with it. Although the sound quality is fairly good (not great), I frequently encounter lock-ups, in which case I have to unplug the phone and reset it. Also, something has happended to the phone so that it now constnatly displays both phone lines as being in use, regardless of whether any line is acutally being used. I replaced it with a GE phone with better displays and which cost about $75.00 less. Avoid at all costs."
3,Great with 1 major problem,"I love this phone the speaker quality is terrific and its very easy to use. But it has one major problem which someone in Tech Support at Polycom rightly (and forthrightly) called a design flaw. It is extremely susceptible to small power surges, which basically blow out the phone. I got my first one in July it died within 3 weeks so got a replacement under warranty and subsequently ran both the power cord AND the phone cord through a surge protector. That worked for almost 2 years but then a bad thunderstorm blew it out again despite the surge protector (i.e. not much of a surge). Out of warranty so I got a new one but I now unplug the phone whenever I'm out of the office. That's how much I like the phone, but be forewarned."
2,SoundPoint - DisaPoint,"Be wary of this phone. It's [pricey] and I have not been pleased with the audio quality of the speaker, mic, or the handset. It is an atractive phone, but in my opinion is does not represent the audio quality of other soundpoint products."
1,Beware this dog,"I bought this expecting it to be a great addition to my office. Six months later I have to dispose of it. It needs to be rebooted now almost every day for the speakerphone to work. It's a piece of crap. Sorry, there just isn't a better way to describe it. do not buy this phone!"
2,Poor Quality for a Premium Price,"I bought this model of phone many years ago and was impressed enough to buy second one after the first one got old. I had problems with the second one pretty much from day one. Unfortunately, I blamed these multiple intermittent problems (poor sound quality, echoing, feedback, lights going on and off, etc) on our phone system. By the time I was able to determine the phone was the problem, the warranty had expired. Now I own a $300 paperweight.Like many premium brands, I suspect Polycom started to cut corners on quality control. Maybe I just bought a lemon, but the experience has moved me back to more affordable devices. My $80 RCA phone works 100% better."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this phone a couple of years ago. The phone kept getting very hot so I returned it and the new one did the same thing. I also noticed that the sound quality was not as good as my old AT&T or Panasonic land line phones. After about a year of using it, I started hearing a lot of static on the line. Of course, it was out of warranty and they would not help me. I could have gotten it fixed but it was cheaper to buy a new phone. I noticed that the price has really gone down for this phone.. I wonder why? Hmmmm could it be a quality problem? Not worth the money."
1,Not worth the money,"The speaker quality is not what one would expect on a $180 phone, there is always a bit of a buzz on the speaker. And the other reviewers are right the hand set is not comfortable and the ever present buzz when you use it gets really worse if your hand touches the Handset cord. I work from home and sound quality is key. I've used the more expensive Polycom phones at the office and they work great. This one is not worth the money"
3,Broken when we received,"The Polycom phone only worked on one line. We set it up correctly. Checked everything by plugging another phone (the exact same kind) in the same outlet and everything worked fine with the other phone. The good news is, Amazon was quick to refund, but would have been better if the phone actually worked. Especially considering the price!"
1,wasted money - lasted only a year,"Sound quality is awesome - that's why I bought it (after trying out one that somebody else had). But after a year it suddenly developed a loud hum that is always audible to both calling parties during calls - so now it is not useable. So what do I do? Throw it away? What a waste of resources. I wish manufacturers would make things that last at least a reasonable amount of time.Also, during it's life, it had trouble disconnecting from calls and did not display caller ID after the calls (couldn't go back to see he called previously, for example)."
2,Fails as a speakerphone,"The phone itself is fine, but you get this for the speakerphone. However, when I got it, everyone says my voice is too faint (even though I am next to the mic). So I ended up using a headset, which defeats the purpose of spending the money on this phone in the first place.This Polycom is not the same quality as those in corporate conference rooms (of course those units cost a LOT more)."
2,"Good Sound Quality, Hard To Use","I have found the speakerphone sound quality of this phone to be quite good, as you would expect from a Polycom product.The trouble with this phone is its stunningly poor user interface. Bringing up the call history list is an exercise complex menus and confusing button placement. The screen is not back lit, making the display hard to read at most angles and conditions.It's a nice phone in some ways, but Polycom's design makes it too frustrating to be worth it."
3,"Good speakerphone, but handset lacks feedback","This phone has two significant shortcomings. The first disappointment is the lack of feedback in the handset. Most quality phones provide some amount of feedback of the user's voice to the earphone speaker, which makes the phone conversation sound more normal. However, with the SE-220 only the person's voice you call is present in the earphone speaker.My second disappointment is the small LCD display.Other than those two complaints I believe the phone performs well, which I would expect base on the cost."
4,Solid. Except for...,"Just bought two for my small business. I would echo the praises already stated. No problems with audio quality in any mode (handset, headset, speaker). I'm satified overall except for these (minor) issues:--No LCD backlight--Display points at ceiling, not at operator (angle too shallow)--No way to program a ""pause"" into speed dial numbers (e.g. one speed dial push to set phone on call forward AND enter forwarding number)--You must navigate the menus to determine if you have missed calls (no alert on the LCD)Other than these, it's the perfect phone for me."
2,Design flaw,This speaker phone emits a constant white noise from the speaker all the time. Even when the speaker is not in use. I returned one unit to Polycom that has this problem and the replacement had the same problem. The noise gets increasingly louder with time. This must be a design flaw. The noise is very annoying if you work in a quiet environment.
3,Great Speakerphone. Everything else sucks.,"If you are considering buying this phone and using it exclusively as a speakerphone, it is wonderful. Great sound quality. Most people don't even realize they are on a speakerphone. My mom doesn't even notice. (and that is amazing!)If you are considering this phone as a desktop phone, think twice.The two biggest desktop phone usability issues are:1. The display is not backlit or tiltable. This means you must stand up at your desk to view the display. I even have an angled phone stand and it is still hard to see. At this price, a tilting, backlit display it not too much to ask for.2. The user interface is pitiful. If you want to check the caller id log, it takes several cumbersome button clicks. If you aren't careful, you can delete the first entry in the speed dial list when trying to view the caller id log. ARRGH!"
4,2 Line phone,Overall everthing i expected - tremendous quality of speakerphone lets confrence calls pass at great clip. Only changes i would make are the screen should be backlight and the menu is clunky to quickly get to missed calls and then a quick callback
4,Great Speaker Phone,As good as a speaker phone gets. Same basic sound quality as any of the high quality conference room phones. It's funny how many times I see this phone on TV and in pictures now that I bought it. The functions are a little too robust for what I needed so it is more difficult to get to some functions than I would like. It doesn't work at all without power which is a disappointment since I want one phone that doesn't need power for when the power goes out so this one won't fill that slot.
2,Not as helpful as I'd hoped,"I've been looking to update my outdated Mac troubleshooting books and thought this would be a good replacement. I was sadly disappointed. In the past few weeks several issues have come up none of which were covered in this book. In my opinion, if you're looking for a how-to-fix-it book, this is NOT it."
5,Great book for kids and parents!,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this book -- as do I. From the very first time we read it (at just over 2), she has been fascinated with the notes that the cows and Farmer Brown leave each other. She has started asking for notes for herself and now sleeps most nights with a note on a 3x5 card. Its been a great way for us to provide her with little affirmations -- and at her own request.This is a great book that I will give to friends with toddlers. Easy to read, good illustrations and a cute story that doesn't bore Mom and Dad on the 10,000th read."
3,OK,"The story is cute but I am not sure about teaching my kid negotiation, strike and civil disobedience skills."
4,"Very enjoyable book, we read it often at the children's museum","This is just a book of sheer silliness.The cows, having obtained a typewriter, unionize for better conditions (they want lights and electric blankets).When the farmer finally gives in to their demands... the duck runs off with the typewriter. (They want a diving board.)There's no pretense of a moral here, it's just a silly book about a silly situation. Just what's needed sometimes :)"
5,Fun on the farm!,"This is my son's FAVORITE book. When I first read it, I was skeptical, but the click, clack, moo chorus is very appealing for my son, and he finds the story delightfully silly- especially the ending (click, clack, QUACK!). The pictures are adorable.On the practical side, it has some good vocabulary in it (Farmer Brown is furious!) and the pictures help the narrative (you can see Farmer Brown getting angry and frustrated, the animals are typing, sleeping, even eavesdropping!)and there is plenty to talk about with your young listener."
5,for parents too,"our 2 year-old loves this book. the pictures are great. the story is hilarious. I read click clack moo to my son 8 times yesterday, and I am looking forward to reading it to him again!"
2,Cute but not for little kids,"For very small toddlers or older children this may be a cute book. I thought it was cute and funny when my son was one but now I really dislike it for older toddlers/preschoolers. It demonstrates behavior & language that are not appropriate--specifically blackmail and making ""demands"" and these behaviors are rewarded. Also for those with agriculturally inclined youngsters the idea of cows and hens withholding milk and eggs is really confusing. I have not enjoyed explaining (repeatedly) what an ""ultimatum"" ""neutral party"" and ""strike"" are to my 3 year old. Maybe I'll tuck it away for when he is older."
2,Extremely disappointing.,"The book is mildly amusing, but that's about it. I was very disappointed as the premise held such promise. But the book is overly repetitive (how many times do you have to say Click Clack Moo before it dtrarts to grate? Ferwe than are required by the text, that's for sure), the drawings are not very impressive (too many are too dark and amorphous) and the story, such as it is, doesn't amount to much.I think most kid's at the lower end of the target age range will like it OK, but for the life of me I can't imagine how anyone familiar with any of the classics of literature aimed at this age group could ever regard this as that sort of effort. It's mediocre at best.If you want a great book for this target age get Courduroy, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, Gregory the Terrible Eater or Bailer Goes Camping--all much better stories that are far less expensive than this book."
1,Udders of the world unite!,"Doreen Cronin, Click, Clack, Moo: Cows that Type (Simon and Schuster, 2000)For some odd reason, I was expecting a story that played on the novelty of, you know, literate cows rather than a treatise on a cow union under negotiations with their oppressive, capitalist farmer boss. Still, whether the kiddies will get the underlying themes is debatable at best. Decent use of language which the kids will enjoy, though the repetition may begin to grate on the parent after the fiftieth repetition. *"
2,Inappropriate messages for young children,"Yes, the book is funny. However, when one considers the messaging, the book has problems. First, it teaches kids that going on strike is ok, acceptable; let's promote being pro-union, anti-management (anti-captialist?). Second, it teaches them a negative way to deal with conflict - just withhold something and you'll get what you want. Third, nowhere in the book is the responsibility of the farmer mentioned - the farmer houses these animals, feeds them, and cares for them. The messages in this book are inappropriate for young children. Let's wait until they're old enough to have a class in labor relations."
1,Politics for Kids,"My granddaughters love this story (ages almost 5 & 3). They requested it, in fact, after reading a library copy. I personally have mixed feelings about it. It demonstrates the use of blackmail to get what you want. I'm not sure that's such a good lesson..."
5,I LOVE this book!,"This is one of my favorite children's books (the other is the true story of the three little pigs which my two and half year old daughter is too young to sit through yet.) I love the humor and never get tired of reading it to her. I know the jokes go over her head but no matter, she loves the repetitive refrain of click clack moo and all of the farm animals. Perhaps words such as ultimatum are a bit lofty for a children's book but I look foward to discussing it's meaning with my daughter one day. It's great to have a new vocabulary words to learn instead of reading the same baby words over and over again. Although the vocabulary is a bit sophisticated, the plot of the story is simple enough for her to follow without losing intrest. This is a book I reach for over and over again. Can't wait for the new one!"
5,"A Picture Book Charmer - and Funny, Too!","What makes a picture book stand out from the crowd? An unsual story, crisp, vivid writing, outstanding illustrations that really fit the story, and a (preferably humorous) twist at the end. Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type has all these elements in perfect combination. It's that rare book parents will enjoy as much as children and won't mind reading over and over again. I highly recommend this one - even if you're not a kid."
5,Great Book,"This is the best book. I read it and I loved it. I work in a library so I checked it out to take to the daycare where I also work. I read it to my students and they loved it. They had me read it several times and the third time they knew to say click clack moo, click clack moo, clickity clack moo. It was also passed around the daycare and all the kids liked it."
5,My kids love this book,I am a school librarian and this is one of my favorite to read to my kids for story time. They love the story and the repeating sounds. Highly recommend this book - especially for read-a-loud.
4,Cute Story,I like this book. It is a cute story of negotiations on a farm. I think some of the negative reviewers are looking for deeper meanings.
5,You will laugh,This book is fun to read for my son and I. We giggle along as the cows type away. I'd recommend for any child.
4,"Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type","Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That TypeI had the opportunity to use this book during reading month. As the elementary tech person it made the connection between old and new technology. Students are familiar with type writers that their grand parents have stored away. They find them interesting. This makes a nice transition to computers of today as a time saving tool. Students enjoy the repeating sounds make by the animals that they quickly learn to share at the right time in the story."
4,Animal Rights vs Farmer Brown,"Farmer Brown's troubles begin when he finds out that his cows not only have a typwriter, but also can type! When their simple demands are not met, they form a union with the hens and go on strike. As both Farmer Brown and his animals refuse to budge an inch, a duck shows up and offers an easy solution of compromise to both sides. The cows will give the typewriter back via the duck and the farmer will give his animals electric blankets.Everyone is happy and Farmer Brown thinks everything is back to normal. The threat of chaos returns when the sneaky duck does not return the typewriter and instead sends him a letter on behalf of the ducks on the farm...You will have to read Giggle Giggle Quack, to find out what happens next!A funny book from pre-school to adults with large illustrations, large type and a story that flows well for even those little ones with a short attention span."
5,"click, clack, moo a silly book!","Click, Clack, Moo Cows That Type by Doreen Cronin and pictures by Betsy Lewin. It is funny because the cows asked Farmer Brown for electric blankets. They typed notes to ask Farmer Brown. Farmer Brown said, ""No way"". The cows and the hens said, ""No Milk No Eggs"". The cows gave up the typewriter so they would get the electric blankets. The duck did not give Farmer Brown the typewriter, they used it to write a letter to Farmer Brown so the ducks could get a diving board. I liked that the ducks wanted a diving board. I think you should read this book it is funny and cool.By Brenden Hoffer"
5,"Udderly charming (and educational, too)","This cleverly written and beautifully illustrated book teaches the fundamental principles of the labor process -- the cows, unhappy about their unpleasant working conditions, make a request; the request is denied; the cows go on strike with the support of other barnyard animals; the cows send in a negotiator; labor and management find a reasonable outcome. Too many people forget that labor and industry are a partnership -- without business, there can be no jobs; without labor, there can be no wealth. This charming book reminds us, in a fun and whimsical way, of that basic precept."
5,I adore this one!,"I discovered this book when I was volunteering at the elementary school in my neighborhood. My job was to listen to the kids that were having trouble with reading, and the teacher recommended that I use ""Click Clack, Moo"" with one particular 2nd grader. Well, we got to giggling so loud out in the hallway that the teacher had to come see what was the matter! PS. She's graduating from high school next year and I am planning on giving her a hard cover copy as a gift! I LOVE this book~"
5,"Click, Clack, Moo - Cows That Type","What a great book! I'm a journalist and I can appreciate the message it makes about communication and the power of words. The cows that type send a message to their farmer that they want electric blankets. When the farmer says no, the cows hold back their milk. Then the cows send a message for the chickens that they also want electric blankets. When he says no the chickens hold back their eggs. Frustrated, the farmer lets the ducks act as a mediator. They offer a solution: electric blankets for the cow's typewriter. The farmer agrees. Read the book to discover the cute ending. What a great book!"
5,Best of the Bunch,"Or perhaps I should say best of the herd, because cows are the heroes of this hilarious picture book -- the first and by far the best of Cronin's books set on Farmer Brown's farm. In this one, Farmer Brown's cows, who love to type on an old manual typewriter that's in the barn, type out a demand: the barn is very cold at night, and so they would like some electric blankets. They sign the note, ""Sincerely, The Cows.""Farmer Brown refuses to give the cows electric blankets. The cows in return refuse to give Farmer Brown milk. And that's just the beginning in this takeoff on working class demands and labor negotiations. Very, very funny, and Highly Recommended."
5,One of my favorite books,"I work with children. I have enjoyed sharing this book not only with the children I've worked with, but I also bought a copy for my mom to share with her pre-school class. The kids just love it!"
3,Surprisingly average for Kenzo,"I'm a fan of the ladies perfume/EDT, so I thought I'd give it a try. A little much on the alcohol for me. But overall, I would consider it a decent, if not casual use fragrance."
1,Nice features....Flawed engineering,"This phone comes in several flavors, silver and gold (1460) trim.My experience is with the 1460. I had all the same problems that were already mentioned. The phone comes with many nice features, but the basic operation is inferior. Range issues with going through just one wall at 10 feet, constant background static, and your own voice is played back too loud and with static, through the ear piece. A similar problem low cost Uniden 2.4G experience. Note, this is not a true 2.4Gig phone, only the base transmits at 2.4GHz, the handset transmits at 900 MHz according to the owner's manual. I returned it and got a Motorola 362 in the same price range. Fewer features, but works well and good sound quality."
1,terrible!,"Got this as a gift and am unfortunately gonna have to return it. My 1st experience with 2.4 ghz and it's way-worse than the GE and Panasonic 900 mhz ones I already have! Can't get a clear line for anything - no matter where I am in house (even tried plugging base into an outlet by itself to keep interference out...) and FORGET going outside! I can't even step out the door whereas with my others I've been able to wash my car in the front yard and talk, too! So this phone ... - no question about it!"
1,Bad Phone,"This telephone kept losing it's security code many times on the first day. Converstation from the other party started off just fine but static and other noises increased so bad, we had to cut off conversation and hang up. We took this phone back on the second day after purchase."
2,Programming horror show,Very difficult to program; range of reception short. Does allow for turning on and off remotely--an important feature for those who forget.
1,Just not happy,"I am going to return this phone.Handset ""feels"" funny. It's a difficult/awkward shape. It is also a pain to hang up, both the handset on the wall, & after speaking.The OFF button has to be hit, not the talk button.There is a very annoying wooshing sound when I am speaking to someone. They can not hear it, but I can. Makes it difficult to speak because at first I thought they could hear the noise as well. Previous Uniden 2.4G did not make these noises. Can only assume it's the equipment.Features that were simple & easy figure out on Uniden don't seem to exist on this phone. They may be programmable, but haven't looked at manual.I would check the unit out in person before buying as I did. I made a mistake."
5,Good inexpensive phone,"I know buying a phone is difficult and it could come with mixed openions , all you got to is try. I tried this phone , seems to be a good phone. There is a very very very little static , but if you compare it with panasonic, uniden and sony , this turns to be a winner. I would suggest to try , always can return."
1,AT&amp;amp;T 2.4gig 1455 phone,"If it has an AT&amp;amp;T logo on it, don't get it. I have had this phone for about a year. I dealt with the static because this phone wasn't my main one. The problem I have with this phone now; the handset cannot connect with the base unit. I put a new battery in it, and followed everything the manual and what I could find on the web said to do and still it can't connect. Totally useless. I would return it but unfortunately I did not buy it at Target. I got it at the now closed Service Merchandise. This phone now sits in a pile of my other AT&T &quot;goods?&quot;.I do not recommend this phone."
4,Good Phone,"This phone works well. I live in a large apartment complex and have never had problems with picking up other people's conversations or major static interference. The handset was somewhat awkward the first few times I used the phone; the ear piece is a little too flat and the curve of the back of the phone is not quite right. However, after a few uses, I grew accustomed to it and I am quite happy with this phone. The answering machine is easy to use and can store many messages. The answering machine remote access feature is also very convenient."
1,Poor Sound Quality,The sound quality is horrible. Nothing but echoes and static. The price was very attractive and I thought the name brand carried some credibilty. I was wrong. You get what you pay for. Cheap is cheap! I'm taking it back.
5,All thumbs up!,"We checked this out in the library where it is a reference book. It is that useful and educational!! My son HAD to have it to make the drawer lock for his desk to keep his younger brother out. Don't tell him he might actually learn something too. Lots of basic experiments/ how-to's, and info about Edison. Great book."
3,Pretty Good!,"I think that this book had some good experiments with electricity, some more complicated than others."
4,Interesting experiments,"This is a book that parents and kids alike will enjoy. The experiments are engaging, fun, and simple. I have borrowed this book from the library many times. That is the reason I bought this book to begin with. Rather than have to search for it at the library, I just have to search my house for it."
4,Mystery debris for three,"Raw, rugged beauty through the ears of a distorted but pure trio of guitar, drums, and violin. It is the obvious equality of the latter that gives the group such a memorably unique persona, but in all fairness the other bandmates compliment each other wonderfully and each add to this one of a kind concoction. Extreme asymmetrical drumming and violent violin outbursts underneath a bed of seductive electric strumming creates a sound which does take time to appreciate, but the unhinged wild beauty of it all pays off, despite a little sway towards excessive volume overkill."
5,amazing,"The Dirty Three do something with music that can only be described as magical. I am truly fortunate that an amazing DJ by the name of Kim Sorise in Louisville, KY turned me on to this group.This album is my personal favorite, but please do not pass over their other brilliant outings. I can listen to ""Hope"" and ""At the Bar"" over and over."
5,Great story!,"My husband and I were driving through Vancouver on the way home from a delightful weekend on the Oregon coast and we heard this author being interviewed in a radio book talk show. The next day we bought his book and a week later reserved week in a B&B ""along the lonely northern Oregon coast"". Just loved the birds and oddball people staying at The Little Bird'N B&B. Just loved it! Great, great fall read. Now if only we can find the actual B&B and check-in ourselves!"
2,?,This was not the best book I have ever read. I would say that this is the type of book you would want to read when you are laying around on a winters night with nothing else to do and no one to talk to. Better luck next time.
2,Disappointed,"Though the author gives a good effort, I found the style and story of this book to be dull and uninteresting, even given that it is aimed at younger people (my daughter didn't like it). I was surprised to see that the author has written five other books (a search on the Internet doesn't turn them up) as the work is not that of a polished writer."
3,Not her best,"I grabbed the book when I saw Betina Krahn's name on it, but I was disappointed.The plot was okay, the characters were interesting, but all the parts together did not make an inspiring book. It was a book that you could put down- didn't leave me dying to read more. Try Krahn's book, The Last Bachelor; now that was a great read. I finished The Wife Test, but I wish I wouldn't have spent the time at all. Save your money on this one."
2,:(,"The book was a let down compared to the Betina Krahs last book ""The Husband test"". It was too wordy and too long drawn, the author could have easily reduced the book by 100 pages."
3,Disappointed,"After having enjoyed ""The Husband Test"" I was looking forward to reading ""The Wife Test"" and found it to be seriously lacking. First of all, the knight who claims Chole's heart is a shut down rigid a..hole until about the last 20 pages. Who wants to read about this guy throughout the entire story? The book was too long and wordy and needed to be edited. Too bad too because it had some interesting characters and surprises. If it had been simplified it might have been a much better read."
3,Jerraine's Review,"This album is a pretty good effort.If it had more heartpumping dance jams it would have been as good as the destiny album. Enjoy yourself is one of my favorite songs by the group,I think it's due for a remake buy one of the groups of today."
4,Let Mike & the Jackson brothers show you where to go............,"I'm very fond of this album due to fact that it's my earliest recollection of music. My family was big J5/Jacksons fans in the 70's. After 30 years, this album still hits. The Gamble and Huff produced ""Let me show you the way to go"" is the best reason to buy this album. Mike kills the song from beginning to end. Other stand outs are Enjoy Yourself, Blues Away, Dreamer and Good Times."
3,Pretty Good,"this being the first Post Motown Album finds the Jacksons with the Genius team of Gamble&Huff.the cuts that work for me are Blues away one of the first solo songs ever written by Michael.enjoy yourself was alright.but Let me show you the way to go is the Jam.Michael's voice is Fantastic on this SOng.the Guitar and his voice takes this song to another Level all-together.much of the material on a hold though is 2nd rate.better ALbums would follow like Destiny,Triumph&the Live album."
5,THE JACKSONS EPIC DEBUT,"The Jackson 5 remain a classic, timeless group. The Jacksons may not be as timeless as the 5, but in my honest opinion, the Jacksons had better quality of music. The team of Gamble and Huff brought a new sound to the brothers, and they do an outstanding job. Although many of the songs on this Epic debut were not penned by Michael and his brothers, they were nonetheless performed by them, which makes the songs on here nothing short of beautiful. The standout tracks: ENJOY YOURSELF (energetic, fast-paced dance fest, featuring lively vocals of Michael), GOOD TIMES (gorgeous song), BLUES AWAY (deep song with a nicely-paced melody), SHOW YOU THE WAY TO GO (the guitar and Michael's voice shoot this song straight up there), LIVING TOGETHER (beautiful song), STRENGTH OF ONE MAN (very nice song with vocals from nearly all of the brothers), and DREAMER (yet another nice song). If you want a nice mixture of dreamy classic R&B tunes as well as great dance tunes, get this album."
1,Why is this book so expensive?,I found this book too expensive. How is it possible that average book could be worth so much? Any explanation?
1,A Work of Fiction by a Coward,"I served with Mr. Whitmore in Viet Nam. He was only in the field a month and tried to ""slide"" and get out of duty. He is simply a coward and made up a fictious life to justify his desertion and collaboration with the enemy. You would be better served by donating the money you might spend on this book to your favorite charity."
5,Faith-based Fitness The Medical Program That Uses Spiritual,"In Faith-Based Fitness, Dr Cooper writes, ""Do I believe my body is good and worthy of being treated as a creation of God?"" He challenged me to ask myself this question, and it has changed my life. I will never be the same."
5,From a personal trainer,"Dr Cooper has long been at the front of fitness and conditioning. His institute in Dallas, Texas is where world class people go to improve.This book which ties the spiritual aspect to the normal physical and mental parts of fitness completes the circle where people live. Without the spiritual there is almost always something that is missing. When performing at increasingly higher levels people need to know that there is more to be had and that it is available.Dr Cooper continues to pioneer and then make his findings known. I am sure this will have a similar impact to his concept of aerobics."
3,SOME WHAT OK,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BASED ON CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES BUT THE BOOK FELL SHORT. THERE ARE GOOD INFORMATION IN THE BOOK BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR PERSONAL TRAINER WHO ARE CHRISTIANS
4,Great fun for kids!,"My 6 year old received this for his birthday, and the whole family has had fun playing the game on the ""pass it"" setting. I only gave it 4 stars, though, because my son says that sometimes the game gives him a command and he does it but it doesn't register and he loses the round. This has caused him a lot of frustration. Other than that occasional mishap, this was one of his favorite birthday gifts."
1,Sekaimeisakugekijo: Les Miserables,"My son loves Les Miserables and he loves Japanese Anime. I gave him this thinking it would be a hit, but he didn't even recognize that it was Les Miserables and only liked one song. Bummer for me!"
3,not the brightest bulb on the tree,"Another great stride for the three goofy guys from the Twin Cities. The two opener cuts are possibly the best this band has acheived (at least in the studio) and the songwriting of drummer Scott Macdonald grows more intriguing with each outing (check out ""I Promise Not To Be An Asshole"").Some of the rough edges are wearing away here, with stronger songwriting shining through. MacDonald's ""Vengeance"" sounds appropriately sneaky with its muffled guitar and deflected chorus (""It's always good to see you/But don't use me for your vengeance""). Bill Graber's anthemic riff on ""Turn To"" and serious lyrics stand in contrast to the song credits these clowns used (the members of Boston are listed).Not as consistently strong as previous efforts, but still contains their best songs to date."
5,New World,Maksim is simply the best piano player that I have ever seen - totally loses himself in the music.Elix
5,Excellent,"This combo is really nice. Good construction, good materials. I have used it with a Focusrite 2i2 to record a guitar and the sound is awesome, crispy, brilliant and high quality. To record a voice will need a pop filter."
5,You will be surprised how good these mics are,"We're using these mics with a Focusrite 2i2 and the sound quality is quite good. For the price, it would be hard to beat.We've recorded voice, saxophone, acoustic guitar and a whole band (with just 2 mics). All have sounded very good. The noise level is quite low and there isn't a noticeable hiss or hum."
2,Very Hard Gummies!,Gummies taste good but are very hard ! Will not recommend for kids ....Disappointed with the product and will not order again.
2,Least favorite books,"I love to read, but this is one book that can never keep my attention. I've tried three times, and I cannot get past the third or fourth chapter. The dialect in the dialogues was so hard to read. I don't think the Appalachian dialect is as hard to understand as this book portrays. It made it impossible to understand what most of the characters were saying. Sorry, but the plot may be good, but I don't guess I'll understand until I learn more patience."
2,Much too long,"I have also read Little Shepard of Kingdom Come as young boy and years later as a man, it was terrific. This book moved too slow at times (many ramblings about feelings and flowers) and too fast at other times ( chapters leading up to the business boom, a few pages about the great prosperity and then the bust with little explanation of why).This is book for young girls who need not read it again."
2,Big disappointment,"Gordon's ""The Sacrifice of Isaac"" is one of my favorite books. I really, really wanted to like this book, but I found it to be too convoluted and the motives of the character to be questionable. I hope his next book will be an improvement."
3,Sort of ok,"After reading Sacrafice Of Isaac, I was very dissappointed. The storyline did not allow for much suspence once it began to unfold. I will read Neil's next book but it better live up to his first."
4,Slightly Complex in plots and subplots,"A good book overall but it helped that I had read his other novel ""Sacrifice of Isaac"" previously. Some characters and plot lines do sort of carry over. This is not a sequel but it doesn't hurt to be familiar with his previous work. Neil Gordon is definitely on his way to greatness!"
1,Save your Money!,"There are only about a dozen or so strategy games out there that are more interesting, creative and exciting than Civ3. Consumer beware! This is nothing more than Alpha Centauri repackaged and maybe a little more eyecandy. This is yet another formulaic, static, staid pseudo-strategy game with nothing new or innovative whatsoever. The combat is frustratingly illogical, (axe-wielding warriors defeating tanks?!?) and simplistic, and the controls are simply juvenile and clumsy. Forget economy or commerce too, they are nonexistent in this game. They claim to have hyped up diplomacy, but do not be fooled! All they did was put some pretty pictures in the windows! There is really no difference in this game from Master of Orion, a game which is a decade old now, but clearly the better of the two."
5,Highly Addictive,"My first game of the sort, and WOW be prepared to spend some time on it. The game covers all basic aspects of a civilization from military, interior, to foreign affairs, etc. Obviously the purpose is to become the CIVILIZATION, which can be achieved in a number of ways: a)be the last to survive, b)be first to send a spaceship, etc.Once your civilization gets a decent size, it is a bit more overwhelming to manage the various tasks, but nevertheless it is fun.Once again, highly addictive."
3,"Frustrating, Slow, and an overall disappointment","I was generally disappointed by this alleged ""Game of the Year."" It is light years more difficult than Civilization II, without a corresponding increase in game play enjoyment. Other civilizations do not seem to be bound by the same rules as the player, and they seem to produce units, and gain scientific advancement, at a far greater rate -- no matter what strategy you employ. Geography is almost entirely determinative of outcome and, if you start of on an isolated island, restart the game because you have no chance of winning."
4,Civilization III Review,"I love this game. It's the ultimate strategy game, and it got me hooked. The game is much superior to it's predecessor, Civ II, which I also have. It has better graphics, more diplomacy options, better editor, more realistic barbarians, better governments, trade, and is overall just a much better game. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because not everything is realistic. For example, it doesn't have natural disasters, and I think it needs more civs."
2,CIV III - Boring,"I thought it would be much better than Age of Empires, but I was wrong. Just as in that game, you can never find a winning scenario. I don't know how some of these psople wrote reviews on winning and becoming supreme deity status. The game is slow, there is no diplomacy between nations. Everyone of them declares war on you. All of the opposing civ's reach higher status than you. The other problem is you always run out of resources and are down to 0 gold before you know it. You can't customize policies with other nations and they all want to blackmail you into giving up all of your gold.I like Medieval better. Not as much detail but far better strategy game."
5,What a great read!,"What can I say?This is a great book, even better than the first (TTYL) one. I can only imagine that the third book will be even better (L8r, G8r). I can't wait for it to come out, and once it does, I have a feeling I will be pulling all-nighters again like I did with TTYL and TTFN.Lauren Myracle really captures what goes on in a teens life (boys, fashion, drama, etc), especially todays teens.Well, the countdown begins for the release of L8r, G8r! You know I'll be at the bookstore the first day it comes out ;)"
5,ttfn is great,this book will make you laugh out loud!i couldnt put it down so i read it all in 1 day!its amazing! it catches the readers attention!
2,stil no cigar lauren myracle,"i bought ttyl and then before i read it i bought ttfn to go along with it, it seemed right to have the sequel on hand when i read the first book.what a waste of money!granted ttfn was a little better than ttyl but still, the subject matter and main characters seems so immature! preteen crap!also its really annoying how fast i read this book. i finished it in less than a day. that should tell you what a meaningless piece of fluff it was.ill admit at times i chuckled at the book or identified with one of the charactes but overall i felt stupider after reading it.if your under 15, have at it! youll probably enjoy it"
1,Not redeeming,"Just because some kids do drugs, swear, and have sex does not mean we need to glorify those for all kids. Didn't find anything redeeming enough in the book to pass it on to any teens. It went in the recycling. Hopefully it will do more good made into something else.I don't like giving a bad review - but felt inclined to in this case."
1,What a surprise,My daughter received this series for Christmas. I was appalled after perusing them. The previous Lauren Myracle books were full of promise. These are full of trash. We took them back and purchased three more appropriate books.
1,Trash for young minds,"They author have figured out that sex sells, especially to young teen girls. She concocts this IM narrative to capitalize on the trendiness of this mode of communication. The first book was dedicated to ""the beer boys"". uh, her intended audience is 12-16 year old girls. Hmm, I wonder if this is dedicated to ""Rufus, her favorite drug dealer."" or ""The Ecstacy girls"". I know these are real issues not to be avoided but to be brought out into the open. But glamorizing drug use, teen sex etc, is just irresponsible and exploitative. But I am surprised that she hasnt gotten sponsors like Trojan, Budweiser, and the like to boost profits."
3,Not my cup of tea,"ttfn was definitely an interesting book. It follows best friends Angela, Zoe and Maddie. It is a sequel to ttyl, but I never read the first book and could follow the plot fine. I really did not think I would enjoy this book, so I was surprised to find myself enjoying it about halfway through. The entire book is written in instant messages, so it was sometimes hard to follow the IM lingo.Just a bit of a warning: there are many bad words and mature subjects discussed in this book. I did think this was a fun book, but it was just not my thing. If you want to read a book written in a completely different way, this is the book for you."
1,Plotless drivel,"If ""TTFN"" is an acronym for ""trivial, trashy, feckless novel"", Myracle's work is aptly named. The clever use of of the texting/IM'ing format is eclipsed by a plotless mish-mash of underage drugs/drinking/sex, neglectful parenting, and a dangerously unrealistic example of ""successfully"" running away."
3,It worked perfectly,The ratio of non hits to hits was too high. What more can I say about one CD? It was round and shiny like I anticipated anf fit perfectly in my CD player.
3,jefferson airplane,well most of these songs are great but i could have done without duplicate songs on the cd that werer just different versions of the original.
5,Blythe!,"Oh my gosh I love Blythe! She is the best doll ever. in this book, gina garan photographs Blythe so well that the dolls actually look real. i have a Blythe doll collection for myself and I don't photograph it but maybe I should! Blythe might be expensive doll-whise but she's worth every penny! (Or every...dollar!) Blythe, your eyes can change but the rest of you can't! Blythe, dearest Blythe......YOU RULE!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The Eyes Have It!,"What wonderful imagery! Gina Garan has truly captured the spirit of Blythe...the big eye doll who is a ""must have"" for all collectors. The photos are mod and colourful, the settings creative and picturesque. I give THIS IS BLYTHE 4 out of 5 stars. My only wish would have been for more shots of Blythe who is sure to become a starlet once again. Blythe darling, you may have been born in the 70's but you haven't aged a bit!"
4,Dylan-The TV Show,This concert was originally done for an NBC-TV special. Notable also for Spider From Mars Mick Ronson's awesome guitar. Great reworks of classic Dylan tunes.
4,Companion to Bootleg Vol 5 - Rolling Thunder Review,"Hard Rain is pretty good stuff, especially at the really nice price. It would be great to see it remastered and expanded a little. I must say that really it does not compare to Bob Dylan Bootleg Vol 5 - Rolling Thunder. That CD set was so incredible that I went out looking for more and found this. The difference is Rolling Thunder bootleg was recorded early on in the tour(s) and this came pretty late. There is a definite difference in the energy level. I wonder why they just didn't release those early recordings? One downside on this, I find the violin on Oh Sister is somewhat out of tune or one of the guitar is, I can't tell. Something is off. Nevermind, Oh Sister appears on the Rolling Thunder bootleg."
3,Gems Hidden in a Haze of Raw Sound,"Dylan has always had the annoying habit of chronicling only his less impressive tours and shows on record. We get nothing from his ""golden"" '60s period, but we get ""At Budokan"" and ""Dylan and the Dead."" It's absurd. ""Hard Rain,"" a souvenir from the tail end of the 1975-76 Rolling Thunder Revue extravaganza, appears to fall right in line on first listen, with overblown vocals from Dylan and sloppy, willfully unattractive performances all around. But it may eventually strike you as it did me that the rearrangement of ""You're A Big Girl Now"" is actually quite heartbreakingly beautiful and full of feeling, and that the amazing take of ""Idiot Wind"" here comes across as the very definition of that phrase ""sound and fury."" It'll never be one of my favorite Dylan albums, but ""Hard Rain"" does contain a few riveting glimpses of the raw emotion and artistic boldness Dylan is known for."
4,Decent Dylan live album,"This is a live album from 1976 and it's fascinating to see how Dylan reworks material that was previously recorded in the studio. The raucous, high volume nature of the performances greatly enhances songs such as ""Idiot Wind"", ""Maggie's Farm"", and ""Lay, Lady, Lay"" but is less effective with more reflective songs such as ""You're a Big Girl Now"" and ""Shelter from the Storm"" where the light and shade of the original versions is sorely missed."
4,a Hard Rain fell on me and i loved it!,"being a Dylan fan for so many years, this album delivers on all levels. you get all the nuances of voice, style and poetry that set him apart from all of his ilk. a ""hard rain"" is definitely a must have for one's collection."
2,Droning,"I really do like Tangerine Dream, but not this album. It's too long and too similar. While Underwater Sunlight is one of my all-time favourite records, this is monotonous."
1,Incredibly Unbelievable!!,I have never heard a CD that comes anywhere near this CD for boring! It's like every song is one 20 minute long note and every song even uses the same note. They just hit a key on the synth and let the recorder go. Someone occasionally adjusts a phase shifter or sequencer. This is a CD that no one will ever be able to top for boring. A feat that will not be surpassed for all of eternity!!
4,Finally found it!,I saw this book one day at the store but I didn't buy it. Then I couldn't stop thinking about it. It was very hard to find just based on what I had remembered. The book is deep and on the sad side even though it's a really special book. I'm not sure how I would give this book as a gift unless you had that specific scenario going on from the book.
3,"Heavy, expensive, and hard to fnd","At over $50, this is an expensive paper sorter. However, it is very heavy duty, and I have no doubt it will be around for quite some time. I particularly like that the length and width of the unit aren't much bigger than the 8.5 X 11 inch papers that it holds, so it doesn't waste space. File folders probably wouldn't fit in it if that is your goal. It had something inside that was the color of rust when it arrived, but it wouldn't wipe away, and it hasn't gotten on the paper, so it may just be something ued in the finishing."
2,"Poorly organized, random topics with little meat",I don't think I've read a computer book as poorly organized as this one. The basic premise seems to be present some random aspects of XQuery or related topics in a chapter and have no flow through the book.There is a lot of good material in the book but try to find it - it's more or less impossible because the index is abysmal. There's no real introduction to how to use XQuery - instead we start off with XSLT. That may be OK (they are related) but it seemed a bit strange to me.Another problem with the book is that some of it is out of date. The XQuery specification is a work in progress but the book was written after (and refers to) the final draft - but a lot of the examples are not compliant with that final draft.The best thing that I can say about this book is that it forced me to research issues more deeply and therefore find out what I needed to know. I wouldn't buy this book - try to borrow it and see if it meets your needs.
1,Below average,"Totally agree with previous post titled 'Poorly organized, random topics with little meat'.The book has a amateurish feel, full of topics that are not coherent, basically just a few lines here and there to fill up the page.Look for O'Reilly XQuery by Priscilla Walmsley, a much better book."
3,Trivializing History,"The music is fine. But if you attended an opera entitled ""HITLER"", would you be satisfied if the plot emphasized the disagreements between the title character and Eva Braun? If you attended an opera entitled ""LINCOLN"" would you be satisfied if the plot emphasized the conflict between the title character and his wife? The story trivializes history. It might have been called ""The Love Interest of El Cid"", or whatever that title might be when rendered in French."
4,Powerful Story,"The storyteller, Aunt Beth, relates to her niece the story of her great-great grandmother Ella Sheppard. This is the story of the determination of a girl to save her school by forming a chorus and taking them on tour to raise money. While the story is fiction, Hopkinson reveals in a note at the end of the text that is was inspired by factual events. Raul Colon's earth-toned art gives this book a historical flair. The glowing illustrations are suggestive of old photographs. The child narrator gives the book the personal effect to entice the reader to be indulged. This story illustrates the power of hard work and determination."
1,What songs are here?,"Dear Amazon,There's no track listing here. There also isn't a track listing for the Fleetwood Mac CD ""Perfect In Every Way"". Do you expect us to be interested in buying a CD when we can't see what songs are on it?"
4,Good Post-Space Period album,"After the disappointing Exit this album was pretty good. I recently started checking out the later TD (after Cyclone) and found this album to be pretty cool. I love the period from Atem through Stratosfear, add Encore to that. Then I heard Cyclone and Exit and thought blah. This one was pretty good, more like the earlier material but without the analog instruments like flute. Much better than the later period ie Optical Race, which wasn't to my taste."
3,"Overrated, but easy to listen to..........","After reading all the great reviews for this album I hate to be the one to burst the euphoric bubble, but IMHO this album is probably the most mediocre of the ten TD albums in my collection. However, it is pure Dream and has some good passages, just don't expect too much from it."
5,Tangram is A+!,"Tangram is THE first Tangerine Dream CD to start with. Put on the headphones and zone out. No drugs required. Next CD would probably be Exit. This will give you an excellent background in the TD experience. This is New Age before all the hype. Original, raw, and completely visionary!"
1,mix-up,"I think Amazon mixed things up here. Everything mentioned here refers to the original 1980 Tangram (which deserves 5 stars), the tracklisting as well as all the reviews (mainly from years ago....). But this is the 2008 ""re-mix"" (or rather ""techno-overdub"") of Tangram from 2008, which will hardly delight fans of the original album. So be warned if you follow these reviews, you WON'T get the original Tangram album (unless they show the wrong cover-art and album title...)"
4,Excellent Images but could use more words,"I just recently got this book and I must admit, as a graphic designer, this book is quite helpful with learning more of the different animals' anatomy and structure but the only negative thing I can say is that it could be even more helpful if it had more words in it to go along with the images he shows you. Adding some instructions would help a long ways to showing a person how he got to each image. But all in all, it's very helpful.Mike Sexton,Owner, Birdman's Designs"
4,Art of animal drawing,"amazing book, would have liked a few more types of animals such as lizards, birds, & fish but for mammals its great."
5,best book ever,"if you are studying animal drawing, this is one of the best books ever. this concentrates on the motion and line of action, as well as the construction!"
4,Awesome images to study,"This book has some great illustrations and sequences to study, but with only one paragraph per page, I sure wish it had more explanations in it. It's a great book, but it does lack where words are concered. I would recommend getting it anyway though. I love it."
3,Foundation means foundation.,"This book is meant to be background for a first undergraduate college course in anatomy and physiology. At least one of the 2 main authors teaches in a junior college. To its credit the book presents its material in bite size chunks with frequent self-tests.The book covers elementary biology, chemistry, and physics as applied to human anatomy and physiology.I enjoyed the book- but you should understand what you are buying."
5,It's a Keeper,"Don't know why these are so hard to find in retail stores. Sure, they cost a bit more - but the quality and durability is topnotch. Perfect size for single-meal leftover storage, side dishes, or sauces. I recently dropped the container after filling it with soup and sealing the lid. Bounced twice, and came to rest on it's bottom. Did not spill a drop! Don't try that with a Wally-World knockoff.Wish they made this in a 5-cup size as well. I've been looking for something to store my (cupcake) coffee filters in, but the 4-cup size is just too small."
1,Good product stupid service,"Ordered 20 of these. Take 20, put them into a box and ship them. Simple? No. They'd rather single-package them and waste resources and my time, not to mention that since I have to account for everything it was a paperwork nightmare. They got monkeys working there or what?Then Amazon decides they don't want to ship any more.Poor service, so poor in fact. I may stop using Amazon because of it."
4,Great product,This was bought as a gift for someone. She loves her lattes and bought a machine. The pitcher and thermometer make a great accessory! She loves it!
5,The Portugese man of war,A sea dwelling jellyfish known as the man of war.I have never seen it but i know that it stings it's prey.The Portugese man of war can also bite and sting a human if caught on the shore or in the depths of the ocean.Many believe it is the most powerful stinger in the ocean and it is acknowledge as one of the most powerful jellyfish of the sea.These are the words i have put together to describe the subject of the book.
5,"Well, It's A Tony Hillerman Book!","not much reason for spoilers or other gory details. I've read them all.but now, the libraries have a very limited selection. I'm delighted to nowown this large print Tony Hillerman novel. and I look forward to buying fromthis seller again. they are excellent. I'm not a huge fan of book buying,as I am a cheapskate. but, I mentioned the library issues. sorry kids, I donot know how to enable comments or voting. I'm looking. nothing looks realobvious. anyway, a fun story. I am waiting for Skinwalkers to arrive so myset will be complete."
4,Unguarded Windows to the Past,"Tony Hillerman's A THIEF OF TIME puts Leaphorn and Chee on a search for a killer who is destroying the ancient burial grounds. The Anasazi who lived, flourished and vanished have long been a puzzle for archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians. But to the Native Americans the ancient ones are sacred and the artifacts they left behind belong to the people who knew not the concept of individual ownership.A THIEF OF TIME will take you on a journey through the lands of the Navajo nation with Hillerman serving a tour guide. Enjoy every moment.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,Easy Reading,"I read ""Thief of Time"" during a dory trip down the San Juan River. The perfect book for this occasion since the story took place in this area."
3,Very entertaining,"This is only the second Tony Hillerman book i read. I am not a huge fan of mysteries, but this one was quite good. I liked the anthropological bits thrown in, the references to pottery and the Anasazi culture. The plot was fairly easy to follow, and i thought the interplay between Leaphorn and Chee was very real. The solving of the mystery was great, as i certainly was not expecting it. If you like mysteries with a twist, this book is for you."
3,"enjoyable read. Nice imagery, but bogus motivations","I liked the book -- it's a pleasant read. The mystery/suspense builds throughout the story, as more and more people turn up dead. I found the characters to be generally believable, with one exception... But that one exception is the 'bad guy', whose unbelievability makes the whole thing kind of weak. Still, there's the vivid imagery of the American southwest, and a taste of Native American anthropology and culture that kept me reading. And besides, I didn't find out about the bogus ending until the end!I'll read more Hillerman."
5,A Theif of Time,"Having spent 30 years in Law Enforcement, and knowing forensics, and how much down and dirty investigating goes into solving a crime, and having a keen interest in Archeaology, I felt that Mr. Hillerman is a master of combining police work, Archeaology, suspense into one believable mystery. His intertwining of Indian culture, and modern day police work is ingenious. I have read all of his books twice or more. I love them.Mystery Buffs should not miss Hillerman's work."
5,I love this Hillerman guy,"Did you know you can take a topographical map of the Four Corners area and track every arroyo, every butte, every mesa and canyon and rio seco mentioned in Hillerman's books? They're all there. Just get yourself a 4-wheel drive vehicle and go off road and have an adventure as you read each of his mystery tales. Right where he says the truck in his book went left into what looks like an untracked wilderness down a barely-visible double track leading to god knows where, sure enough, there those faint tracks in the dust appear.Set against the backdrop of the long-vanished Anasazi, Hillerman weaves a complex tale setting Anglo culture against the values of the Dinai, the Navajo tribal people. Elderly Joe Leaphorn and brash newcomer Jim Chee (with one foot in the spirituality of the Navajo healers and the other in the Western world) combine forces to solve the mystery surrounding the disappearance of an anthropologist."
3,Difficult to follow in abridged audio version,"The story is engaging, and the historical background is enlightening. This abridgement for audio, however, leaves a little to be desired. Compressed to 2 cassettes, the jumpy action allows insufficient time for character development. Having the author, who is not a trained actor, read the script compounds the editing problems. Hillerman's southwestern drawl, delivered in chesty baritone, is authentic and pleasant to listen to, but it is often impossible to tell which character is speaking. They all sound the same. He also has distracting pronunciation problems (e.g., ""heeliocopter"") and when he intones ""Chee said..."" it sounds like ""She said...,"" adding to the confusion. This is one title that is best appreciated unabridged in print."
4,Not his best but wonderful,"Hillerman really knows how to spin a good tale and tie together all sorts of different subplots together into one knot as they all interrelate. Joe Leaphorn doesn't believe in coincidences, and neither does the author. And nothing simply coincides in his books, all the subplots come together neatly.An anthropologist disappears, two men are found murdered, a backhoe is missing and Joe Leaphorn, who's wife has recently died and is retiring from the force, wants one last big case before he quits. He cooperates with junior officer Jim Chee who just wants to find out who stole that damned backhoe and murdered those two men in the truck.The book is really full of surprises and has a totally surprise ending. Not the one that I was really hoping for or betting on, but it was a shocker. A little hard to follow all the plots coming together however, which was why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5."
3,A fast-moving tale,"Hillerman crafts a good mystery. The words are tightly wound and clear. The grande finale is a bit forced, but it's fun arriving there. This was my first Hillerman, and I'll be back for more of his simple, engaged storytelling."
2,Contrived ending.,"In my opinion, the most satisfying mysteries are those in which the ""whodunnit"" is drawn from facts and circumstances that are developed throughout the story. Having the solution depend on the introduction of a character (or an unlikely turn of events) introduced right before the end is disappointing. I admire Tony Hillerman and I have enjoyed many of his books. This one, however, left me with the impression that he started without a very good idea of where he was going, and he just ran out of ink."
4,Interesting and educational,The plot had interesting twists and turns. It was a little hard to follow. I liked learning about Navajo culture and the local conditions. The characters were very human.
2,A so-so read,"This was the first Hillerman novel I ever read.How it ever became a best seller amazes me! Fortunately it was the only book I had with me on vacation, or I would never have gotten through it. About halfway through, however, things did improve.Hillerman does a good job of evoking the flavor of the Southwest and the story is interesting enough. But, I made the mistake of reading this immediately after having read Michael Crichton's ""Timeline"" which is a much more engaging and entertaining book.Based on my experience I doubt that I'll read another of Hillerman's works."
5,A Thief of Time,"This book is a great read! I have read it twice, the second time in about four hours. I have read all of Tony Hillerman's books and thoroughly enjoyed each one, but this one is the best. I live in Utah and having stayed at the Recapture Lodge and driven through parts of the Big Rez myself, I feel like I have traveled in the footsteps of T.H.'s two heroes, Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. Anybody who is interested in the Navajo culture, archeology, geography, law enforcement, mystery and/or an excellent story will love this book."
3,Loose ends left,"The story went well until the last chapter. This mystery left a few items unexplained. It is as if the author rushed to finish the book. As much as I enjoyed the writing, this will probably be the only Hillerman book I'll read. BTW: Who got sloppy allowing a surname to be split (hyphenated) between lines - not the editing one would expect from a best seller?"
5,Hillerman's best,"""A Thief of Time"" is not just a good mystery (and it's a very good one), it's a fine novel. The integration of the Chee and Leaphorn story lines is about as masterful as tying story lines together gets. The Anasazi history is an added bonus."
2,NOT big enough,"I bought this clock for my home-bound, slightly disabled step dad. When I unpacked this clock, I was shocked to see that it was barely 9"" across. It's smaller than the average wall clock. You'd think it would be slightly bigger, since most people who would want this clock might be a little bit older, or retired, who might not be able to SEE this clock, since it's smaller than normal. VERY disappointed, very little clock for the price. I would return it, if I didn't need it for a gift, and I'm sure I'd lose my 8.95 shipping I paid too. what a rip off."
5,Great Explanations!,This book is great for any Protestant who wonders why s/he feels something is missing in their spiritual walk. Matthew Galatin shows the shortcoming of the Protestant rationalistic thinking and an alternative scarcly known in the West. This alternative is Orthodox Christianity. The power and beauty of the Church is foreign to most of the West and Matthew wants to show you how you are selling yourself short and to get you to start thinking in a different mindset. This book has been a great blessing to me I hope others will consider buying it as well. God Bless you all!
3,Maybe,"A jab at those who grew up in a non-Orthodox faith tradition. A good look back for the convert to Orthodoxy, but not for the seeker."
5,A great book !,I remember the first time I read this book. I felt deeply convicted and encouraged at the same time. The author divides very difficult matters for protestant to understand in a very easy and digestible manner. In fact this is the book I give to my family when they have questions about the Orthodox faith and how it relates to their beliefs. I have not talked to anyone whom I have given the book to read whoes view of Orthodoxy were not changed. They may not have agreed with the Church but they understood it so much better that it allowed a much better dialog to discuss the Orthodox faith. I whole heartedly recommend this book.
2,Tales of Terror and the Supernatural???? Hardly.,"Short stories by English author Wilkie Collins. These were all written in the 1800s. Wilkie wrote two classic novels (""The Moonstone"" and ""Woman in White"") which I enjoyed very much. ""Moonstone"" is a mystery and ""Woman..."" is a drama with a few Gothic horror touches thrown in. I was looking forward to this book--but was VERY disappointed it. The stories are all well-written but they're somewhat long-winded and (most importantly) not even remotely scary. Most of the times the purportedly scary incidents are of human origin! In some of these various incidents go completely unexplained or the resolutions don't make one bit of sense! I was more bored and frutrated but was supposed to be a horror book. Boring, long-winded and not even remotely scary. You can skip this one."
5,Hands-on exercises and advice are perfect for intermediate-level students in construction management and interior design,"Any college-level library appealing to architecture and interior design students - especially those involved in commercial buildings - needs SPACE PLANNING BASICS. The third updated edition includes coverage of stair design, a new section on such design, and programming examples for small and large commercial spaces (up to 4,000 square feet). Hands-on exercises and advice are perfect for intermediate-level students in construction management and interior design."
3,Space Planning Basics,"My ordering experiance with this company was OK. I placed the order back on Sept 19, 2012. The order was sent out on or about the 26. The only issue I had was that some how my order was over looked and not sent out until the 26th. Now in their defence they did send me and email about the overlooking of my order and asked if I still wanted the book. My answer was YES I want the book. Now I was without the book for two weeks for school but survived. I liked the professional approach that was given to my order, Late but handled very well. Yes I would recommend this company for any order. I know I will be back."
3,Not Bad,"Reading the book and listening the kindle read for me is fun, but the book does not show the page number."
2,Comfort level,"Bought this based on the excellent reviews I read and was so looking forward to ""sleeping on a cloud"" like someone had described. I have a Sealy Signature West March Luxury Firm Box Top Mattress so the mattress is extra thick. I also bought the mattress cover which was pretty thick. After I received this mattress pad I initially put it under the mattress cover and was quite disappointed as there was absolutely no difference. I later removed the cover and put only the mattress pad. I must confess I have not experienced that feeling of sleeping on a cloud. What makes my sleep more luxurious is that I have a really nice down comforter and 8 down pillwos (2 king and 6 regular) and these usually form my ""cloud"" effect. So rather disappointed as this was a lot of money to spend on a mattress pad"
5,"Great, affordable gauge","I bought this for myself and just ordered one for my Dad for Christmas. It's all wireless and anybody can set it up, if I can! I love it, it does what it says and most stations that do weather and rain are alot more money."
2,Dead Battery,The watch was received promptly and in good shape. However the battery was dead and i had to take it to a jewelery store to get it replaced.
2,"Some nice features for the price, but poor performance.","I was attracted by this multi-handset phone's low price and many features, however my wife immediately noticed an echo when using the handsets. We could have lived with that, however we also noticed that reception was poor when using the handsets away from the base. I tried using the spare handset in my home office (less than 100 ft. from base) and everyone I spoke with said that my voice kept cutting out. Additionally, battery life is poor. I'll be returning this unit and buying a Vtech or Siemens."
1,On it way back,We tried it for a month and it is now on its way back to Amazon. Calls were not clear even within 10' of the base unit. Tried to change settings on the base unit and they were not recognized. Definitely not worth the price.
1,If your looking for decent battery life....,"dont look at this phone. have had the phone for about a year. recently went out and bought new batteries, but still lowsy. come home from work, take the phone off the cradle and 3 hours later it starts beeping that it needs to charge. if you spend 15 minutes talking on the phone, it starts beeping in your ear. i bought this phone thinking it would be convenient having multiple handsets. all it has done is make life more difficult. having to RUN up the stairs to try to get to the other handset before the current one goes dead....also, loses its connection to the base atleast once a week. which means disconnected unit from the wall and power, plug all back in and HOPE that that takes care of it. may have to do it several times."
4,great phone for a family,"I got this phone for Christmas and am very happy with it. I like the fact that you can program one phone and both program at the same time. I had no problems programing the phones or the answering machine.Unlike some other reviews, I have not had any problems with any constant hum. There is one spot in my house (near the answering machine base) where I feel like I am in a tunnel, but all I have to do is take one step over and all is well. All over the rest of the house it is fine.I especially like that I can page and transfer a call. It's great with the kids upstairs and me downstairs - eliminates having to yell to tell them the phone is for them."
2,Very Disappointing,Decided to buy this unit over a Uniden one...what a mistake! I'll simply list the problems/shortcomings we've had/noticed in our 4 months of ownership:1. Batteries die in 16 hours without any use!2. Low Battery warning tone occurs 10 seconds before they die3. Playback of digital recorder is poor4. Reception/transmission is worse than our old Panasonic 900 Mhz5. Buttons small and too close togetherI truly regret purchasing this item.
1,Caller ID Not Effective,"When handset is lifted from the charger base, the caller ID display would disappear with no chance of getting it back. Also, I could not use a programmed in long distance card pin number in because memory could not be re-accessed after initial dialing. Also, answering function is not integrated with caller ID nor with handsets. I returned the unit after one day."
1,No luck with these,"I bought this set at target as a replacement for my panasonic that did not have caller id - well, long story short - it was a complete dissapointment. The sound quality is bad and the batteries lasted about 3 months."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,Please do not buy this phone - it stopped working completely after only SIX MONTHS. Many problems after only 3 months.I'd rate it MINUS 5 stars if I had the option...
2,Annoying echo,"The dual phone set is nice, and caller ID appears on both handsets. I chose this phone mainly because I loved the color, and I wanted 2.4 ghz. The most disappointing is the annoying echo I hear when I'm talking on it. Callers say I sound fine to them, but on my end I can hear the echo of my voice and I end up with a large headache after using it. Also, the numbers on the handset are small, hard plastic and hard to dial, especially if you actually have a fingernail. I am taking this phone back to the store tomorrow."
2,You Get What You Pay For.,"You get what you pay for, and my advise to anyone thinking of buying this answering machine phone combo is to pass on this model and brand name (AT&T really doesn't make this system, THEY JUST PUT THEIR LOGO ON IT). Why pass on it?1) Bad voice reception with the person you are talking to (i.e. yhey can't hear you very well)2) Bad reception.3) After you call this machine for messages (when you're at another phone or on vacation)you can't monitor the room in your home or apartment to hear if your dogs or whomever is okay,(but my old Panasonic answering machine enabled me to do thisMoral of story: If you're in the market for a system like this one, then buy a Panasonic brand - I know I will - when this system dies out."
2,Excessive noise,"I was very unhappy with the excessive noise heard on all calls. Loud buzzing. It was much worse than my 10-year old AT&T phone, with 20 channels. I couldn't wait to return it."
5,Cordless phones are awesome,These phones are great! I've had absolutely no problems with them at all. Terrific value.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Trust me on this! I ignored reviews because I liked the look of the phone, the price and the many features. What a huge mistake. This phone is awful. I cannot say anything positive about it. There should be a selection for a ""0"" star rating. The second handset completely stopped working after three weeks. The sound quality is worse than terrible, the outgoing message is bairly discernible. A real lemon. Anything else is better than this piece of trash. I would donate it to the salvation army or a homeless shelter, but doubt that they would take it!"
1,Don't buy.,"This machine is not worth the money, no matter how cheap you find it at Sam's Club. The phone echoes your voice back to you when you speak. Also, we were never able to use the answering machine function of it as the messages we received on it were totally unintelligable."
3,"Tried 2 different units, took them back . . . .","I agree with the other reviewers that this phone does have an echo or a constant 'hum' in the background. Not sure if this is a 2.4 GHz trait, or just the AT&T phone.The first unit I purchased had constant background static along with the hum on both handsets - which led me to believe it was something in the base unit. The second unit I tried only had the annoying hum. This noise was only present on my end, as those calling in heard me clear as a bell. Plus the people you were talking to on this phone had a 'tinney' sound to them, link they were talking through a tin can.All in all, the features are nice, but for this type of money I expect clear reception."
3,No Speakerphone,"I haven't had many problems with this phone but thought that it had a speakerphone function because Amazon.com groups it with the cordless speakerphones - It does not, so don't buy this phone if you're looking for a speakerphone as well."
2,Poor battery life,I have to agree with many others about the poor quality of this phone. The battery life decreased rapidly and after several weeks I was forced to keeps both phones on their chargers. Instead of gambling on replacement cells I bought a Panasonic phone as suggested by other disappointed AT&T model 2255 buyers.
1,2255 - Worst Phone to Purchase,"Purchased 2255 phone and had one handset that did not work. Tried all of the suggestions provided and still no luck. Absolutely no response from ATT on this. They do not have a ""Customer Service"" Dept. but they let you play phone tag with a computer. The equipment does not work and apparently ATT does not care."
1,DON'T BOTHER!,"I'm getting ""buyer's assurance"" credit from Visa on this phone because it stopped working after little more than a year. It beeps constantly, going out of service randomly. Batteries have been replaced a number of times so that isn't the problem. Don't waste your time."
1,NEVER buy this phone,"My husband and I were attracted to this phone because of the multiple handsets and low price. The AT&T name was also a factor. We are VERY disappointed.... We have only had a short time and are preparing to throw it away and buy something else. The phone has an echo frequently when you are using it, and it seems to have poor reception in that it's often difficult to hear the other person talking. BUT the worst thing is that it periodically will emit a shrill tone (usually in the middle of the night) which continues until you press the talk button several times. I'm not sure what is causing this but I'm close to smashing the thing!!! PLEASE do NOT buy this phone if you value an undisturbed night of sleep!!!"
1,Terrible phone! Avoid like the plague.,"I pride myself on making wise choices with electronics, but I totally failed when I bought this AT&T phone. There are two major problems: 1. messages I receive on the answering machine sound like a garbled computer-generated voice that is generally unintelligible on playback - no exaggeration, and 2. battery life is just plain pitiful. To a lesser degree phone sound quality and mic pick-up are also problematic.I confess that I bought this phone on looks and what I thought was a good corporate reputation - Clearly a bad move. My only regret is that I missed my 30 day return window. Now I'm stuck with using this ""phone"" every day and it pains me to no end. I'm currently considering giving it to Goodwill and buying a completely different phone, but I would feel too guilty knowing that someone else would be using it - I may just put it in the trash can and count my losses."
1,Hunk of junk,"What a hunk of junk! I had to take it back to the store. Why would I keep this when you can hear hissing in the background, people on the other end tell you to speak up and ask what that noise is, and even when you turn the ringer off, it still buzzes like it has a vibrate mode. Take your money elsewhere!"
3,Echo which can be irritating,"I bought this phone about 10 days ago. While at the shop, another lady who was also shopping, told me that she had just returned the set because it had an echo. I wanted to give it a shot because the price was good, company was reputable. After a couple of days, we heard this irritating echo; at times, it was hard to hear the other party speaking. Thought it would go away but since it persisted, we're going to return it today."
2,Great reception-hard to use,"If you're looking for a clear phone, this is it. Unfortunately, the phone is very hard to use. The memory is not very efficient, the callback feature is terrible and the redial doesn't work at all. The scrolling button for the memory is backwards (left is up, right is down), plus when you enter a received number into memory, the '1' is not there. Since the received calls show up on the screen without the '1' in front of them you have to re-enter the phone number. Also, the redial does not work. When I push redial, I get a #. Maybe they worked so hard on the clarity, they didn't have enough time to make it easy to use."
1,Echo & Buzz,"I loved the phone at first...the features are great. Then I got my 1st call and was disappointed. The buzz was annoying. I tried moving the phone line and then the base to no avail. I experienced the echo ""feature"" on the 3rd call which freaked me out. The phone is going back tomorrow."
2,Not my top choice,This phone is nice but extremely annoying. They worked well for a month or two but now they dont even work. It will look fine but as soon as you take it off the charger then it dies on you even if it is charged. These phones have been beeping also and I can't stand it. Or it will just not work and say out of service. I would recommend this as a last resort.
1,"Please, don't waste time & energy on the looks.","Looks mean alot to me.....But wow. As I was returning the clerk said: "" I just got one of these back this morning."" Second return in a few hours time of this phone. The sound is terrible!! It sounds like you are speaking in a can! I could hear one person beautifully, but not the other 3 I spoke with, and I had the volume as high as it would go. The ear part of the phone does not fit nicely into the ear either, you have to press it. The champagne base was what interested me. I REALLY care about the look of things, but my old less than 900mgz cordless was a dream compared to this in sound and use quality.Sorry, if it's the looks you like........"
1,Poor phone,"My experiences with this phone have been unpleasant, at best, for the following reasons:1. The mute button causes a perpetual beep, beep in your ear. So, being on mute is a painful experience.2. The message you record is tinny and sounds awful to those who call in. It is very loud as well.3. Programming the phone (after every power blip) takes 5-10 minutes.4. The battery life is horrid. I've replaced the battery and still no improvement.5. There is no handset locator on the remote base."
1,Simply doesn't work,"Like the others, I bought this phone for the convenience, features & brand. I can tell you that after 8 months, the base handset has virutally died, the ""DIGITAL"" answering machine garbles messages, and the range is minimal. Sound quality is deplorable !!I have to admit that I am looking for a new phone and you can bet that it won't be an AT&T.;Save your money and buy some other brand."
4,Beware - Addictive,I am an adddict of logic games and puzzles and I can not stop playing these games. The only problem is that there are not enough games and after a while any game can become old. Great way to pass time in line or waiting for anything
2,There's always only one Holmes.,"This is an anthology of detective stories in Victorian era, when Holmes and Watson were actively investigating. However, Holmes fans will still be rather disappointed because most are featuring rather commonplace detectives showing off in front of the dumb. Nevertheless, there is still some intelligence in the detectives, which is rarely found in their modern world collegues."
1,Doesn't work.,"Radio reception is bad in the city, so I wasn't surprised when the clock didn't set itself. To set it manually, the instructions say to hold down the snooze button for 3 seconds and the time will flash. It didn't."
1,More Fairy Tale Fantasy,"This represents yet more creationist fantasy. There is no science used to come to their conclusions as they already have a fairy tale answer. It amazes me the lengths creationists go to limit the way their supposedly ""all powerful"" god creates. Evolution is a fact whether the creationists accept it or not."
1,Evolution is a Fact!,"This movie is so flawed it's ridiculous! There is no science in it and it says things like we have no idea how a firefly creates it's light, when we actually make glow sticks the same way a firefly makes light."
4,Very enjoyable Thompson!,"""The Criminal"" is an unusual Jim Thompson novel. He charts the rape and murder of a 14-year-old Midwest girl. The prime suspect is Bob, a 15-year-old neighbor, who has a history with the girl. Bob's a bit of a juvenile delinquent, but comes across as a decent person. His parents are convinced that Bob didn't have anything to do with the murder, or are they?A number of different people become involved in and influence the case, each with her/his own agenda, including the DA, Bob's parents, and the local media. Chapters are told from the viewpoint of these different characters, and this technique is used quite successfully here. The joy of this book comes not from the suspense of figuring out who committed the crime, but in seeing how the case is effected by each character. Overall, a highly enjoyable and fascinating Thompson novel."
1,Dont read this travesty...,"The only reason I gave this book even 1 star is because there was no way for me to give it 0.This is just another piece of white supremacist media by an a-hole neo-nazi, and if you dont believe that he is a white supremacist, check out this comment of his at this link... http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=7306The author of this book is nothing short of a failure at life and a neo-nazi. Do not read unless you are a complete waste of life who is looking for someone else to blame for their problems."
1,these are the same as hand warmers,Make sure you buy the TOE warmers. I have no idea how you would put these in your shoes and be comfortable. Get the adhesive TOE warmers!!!
1,NOT TOE Warmers!,"Beware... These are probably not what you expect. I thought they were the thin glue down warmers that stick to the bottom or top of your sock and conform to your foot (rounded on one end, square on the other). THEY ARE NOT! As a matter of fact, they are exactly the same as the hand warmers, just in a package with a different label and a higher price.DON'T BUY THEM!"
2,Horrible condition,"The poster is nice, exactly as it look on the page but the arrival condition was horrible. The poster was not at all protected in the box it was sent in and you can see all the wrinkle lines from how it was rolled up. Would not recommend."
4,3rd book in the Ashton/Rosemoor series - To Love a Scoudrel written in 2007 it's actually a prequel to the first three books,"Unveiled is historical novel about Jane Rosemoor who decided never to marry because she has mental illness in her family. She meets Earl of Westfield and starts to fall for him and because of her fear that the mental illness worsens after given birth she fights the attractions. The Earl of Westfield also fears that anyone that her loves will die so he fights falling in love. As a mental health professional I found the descriptions of mental illness and the fear of family member very real to life. Check out the whole Ashton/Rosemoor series; TO LOVE A SCOUNDREL (1) UNLACED (2), UNVEILED (3) and UNDRESSED (4)."
1,"A great song, and that was it.","To complement the other reviewers, I just want to confirm that ""Play that funky music"" is still played in more than one disco-bar in the world. I recently heard it in London, in Atlanta (Georgia, U.S.A.)and in Brussels, Belgium... That proves it will probably live on forever, and deserves a BIG star.The cd in itself doesn't offer much more than that track. Perhaps ""99 1/2"" and ""Hold on"" are worth listening. The band released a second album with a good song (""Baby don't you know""), and I think that was all. A pity they couldn't keep the quality of all their tracks at the level of those 4 songs..."
2,one great song then down hill,after play that funky music this set goes down for the count.reminds me alot of todays stuff except you have to pay alot more than you did 20+ years back.but that one cut is worth a few stars.catchy after almost 25 years.
3,Oh -- it _is_ a white boy!,"Duh -- I never realized that this was, like AWB, a bunch of white boys. Makes the song that much more impressive.BTW, folks, it wasn't an audience member during a show who suggested the title ""Play That Funky Music, White Boy"" -- it was the drummer backstage at a gig. At least that's what Rob Parissi says..."
2,james brown-funkadelic clone,you might disagree but wild cherry was a a rock group who wanted to cash in on the funk flavor's of james brown and parliament and his best song was play that funky music which made them a one hit wonder and why vanilla ice sampled it beats me but it ended his career as well.
1,Missing writer for Wild Cherry?,"This is not a joke. My father claims that he was one of the original bandmates of Wild Cherry. He takes responsibiliy for the writing of *play that funky music*His name is Jimi or James Banks.If anyone is familiar with the name or knows who the original members of Wild Cherry were, Please tell me?I need to know whether or not my father is a liar...."
2,Funky White Boys,"Wild Cherry are a classic one-hit wonder. In the fall of 1976 they rode the burgeoning disco craze to the top of the charts with a catchy song based around a bar incident. Singer Rob Parrish and the band were playing in a bar and someone in the crowd shouted out to him to ""play that funky music white boy"". He turned that line into a song that will live on forever. While ""Play That Funky Music"" is a 70's classic, the rest of the album is pretty forgettable. ""The Lady Wants Your Money"", ""Get It Up"" & ""What In The Funk Do You See"" are serviceable, but pretty much everything else is not worth your time."
3,"R.G.BALL, ""LIFE ROCKER""","Don't have this cd yet. Everybody knows ""PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC"" from the 70,s. I did order it because of BIAN BASSET, lead guitarist of ""FOGHAT"" was in ""WILD CHERRY"" then. The ""HAT"" should incorporate that song into their listing."
3,Not Quite Funky Enough,"This cd is a bit schizophrenic: half the tracks sound fast,loud, and danceable; the other half are too thin and weedy-sounding to be truly funky. The short length of the album--less than 30 minutes--doesn't help either. Recommended only for Funk/Disco collectors."
5,First rate,"I have attended several of Jeff's woodworking classes. He is not only a first rate woodworker, he is a first rate instructor. Even if you don't feel ready to try chair making, this book is worth having for the techniques you can learn."
3,Not as good as River's Edge,"I absolutely loved Bostwick's other book, River's Edge and was eager to read this book. Like River's Edge, this book is beautifully written and has wonderful, expressive characters. However, the first 100 pages contain such a sappy love story and I was so disappointed. Once I got past that part, it became a much better read and surprised me with a few plot twists. All in all, a good book but not 5 stars."
3,"1/4 Aviation, 3/4 Fairytale","I would actually like to give this 3 and a half stars. When I found this book, I was expecting more of a woman meets pilot, becomes pilot herself kind of story, but instead it turned out to be a fairytale with a lot of great insight into Charles Lindbergh. The heroine is a farm girl with a disability and when Lindbergh lands in her wheat field, a romance blooms. The book proceeds to be a mixture of fantasy and historical detail both, offering a look at life in the twenties thru forties and the beginnings of aviation without being biographical or dull. However, the main characters were all too good to be true. They were all too sweet, kind, and accomodating to be realistic. There was a lot of religious stuff also, leading me to wonder if this is a Christian book and maybe should be categorized as such. All in all, a good read, and I would love to see what this author could do with a story about Amelia Earhart."
3,A new author (to me) and a startling story,I had been told about this author by a close friend. I looked for the first book she had written and got Fields of Gold. It was a surprising but interesting book which I enjoyed. I'll read more of her works.
4,Aquinas's Summa - challenging read,"This book is very challenging to read at times, however it was very interesting. Very thoughtful way of bringing it down to basic faith."
1,Wheel chocks,I am not impressed with these. I didn't receive the wheel chocks pictured. They hard plastic not rubber as stated in the picture. There is no rope tying them together or holes to put one in. I will never order from company again. Couldn't return product what a waste of money.
5,Great Charlie Daniels Album,FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN and MILLION MILE REFLECTIONS are the two best studio albums by Charlie Daniels. If you're new to Daniels' music get these two and A DECADE OF HITS- preferably all at once.
3,HOWDeeeeee!!!,"THIS is the absolute CDB! It's a foot stompin', beer drinkin', dosey-doin' hogwallowin', just plain ol' fun CD to listen to! Pure Redneck country. Shucky darn and slop the chickens, I'm in HAWG HEAVEN!"
5,The only CDB everybody NEEDS to have,"The Charlie Daniels Band has seen its ups and downs over the years, but none of it matters to the fans who own this album (sorry - CD). Every song is crafted perfectly, music to lyrics, the words obviously came first. Don't even bother putting it in the home CD changer, just plop it in the car stereo, back out of the garage - hopefully top down - get on the first highway or abandon country road you can find and turn the volume to one notch above bearable. Even if you are sixty-five you'll be singing along like a sixteen year old on the way to pick up his date on the first night his parents let him use the car. This damn CD is simply the best driving music ever written. Don't tell me about your favorites until you've heard mine, it's cost me at least ten speeding tickets already and it's worth it"
5,A Great Album,"This is a classic southern rock album, there isn't a bad song on it. From the hard driving Caballo Diablo to the blues rock No Place to Go, CDB's southern roots are evident. This is a CD that was meant to be listen to turned up loud, while you sing along. The spirit of early seventies, southern rock isn't expressed better than it is here."
4,Smokin',"This album is an insane blend of seventies country and the blues jams of the Allman Brothers Band. Even the cheesy Trudy is a gem. From the first wailing notes of Caballo Diablo to the last licks of Orange Blossom, this album is on fire! Charlie knows how to jam on the guitar and fiddle!"
3,Abandon hope all ye who enter,"John Gray wants to convince us that we humans are not elevated above animals. Although I am willing to consider human beings as part of a web of life rather than king of creation, Gray's tone is too angry to read. He hurls statements at the reader without bothering to back them up. His goal seems to be to remove all hope of meaning or any positive change in order to convince us we no more than ""rapacious predators"" in the clutches of random natural selection."
5,Read it!,"John Gray is one of the few original and consequential contemporary thinkers. In my opinion, this is his most significant book. It is an eye opener. It is compact but it packs a devastating intellectual punch. Modernity can't be properly framed without this small volume. Read it!"
1,How Poor...,"This book is such a lineup of nonsensical statements that one can only ask:How poorly intellectually gifted can one be and still write a ""philosophical"" book ?!"
3,"Human yes, Only human no.","It's not that I don't recommend it. I think we should all explore every aspect of humanity. It's our species afterall. However, I find the lack of soul in this otherwise intellectually spun thought. The missing element is that which we do not see. The human is not controlled by the beast alone (at least the ones I like to accompany). I tried and fought hard but the eternal optimist in me had to work hard to get through it. I am a monkey. But I am a monkey that is headed toward succumbing to the whims of my soul and not the animal. Entering the age of Galactic awareness, we must leave the vessel to lesser tasks and not lend it so much weight. This will be our memory past. I hope."
5,summer phoenix is phenominal,"this is a beautiful film. its everything that great serious filmmaking stands for. summer phoenix was perfect in it. she is such an amazing actress. anything with her,rain,river or joquin is a pretty safe bet that its gonna be amazing. i first saw summer in the movie ""girl"". she disapeared in the movies for a long while and then came back. this is one of the first i saw after her film come back. after i saw the believer that is. both esther kahn and the believer are some of my favorite movies. stunning."
2,Waste of Time-Don't Bother,"Oh my, I wish I could get the time I spent watching this back. Summer is gorgeous as usual in this, but the doe-eyed incompetent half-wit she portrays in this is annoying, dull, and bland beyond description. How this inept idiot could have ever made it to the stage stretches credibility to the limit. One star for seeing her breasts and another for the eating glass scene. If this movie was a little more watchable, it could be considered dumb. Very good job depicting the look and feel of the era though."
2,Incorrect equations and information,"Unfortunately there aren't many textbooks out there dedicated to the magnetocaloric effect. In fact, this is the only one I've been able to find. This textbook is full of incorrect information from the start. I had to re-derive the basic thermodynamic relations and Maxwell equations in Chapter 2 in order to correct the more complex equations used later in the book. Much of the explanations are confusing, unclear, contradictory, if not outright wrong.I really wish the authors would make a serious revision, or that other experts in the field would publish a better book with more accurate information."
3,Tubby the Tuba,"This is a classic children's story. However, I was a little misled as to the narrator on the cd. The description of the story led me to believe it was the classic story with Danny Kaye narrating. My bad, I should have looked before I bought. But the story is so great for kids. Now I can't find the Danny Kaye version and don't even know if it's ever been mass-produced. Sorry."
5,5 Star Book!,"This is a great book to introduce your kids to the instruments in the orchestra and what they sound like (CD included). The catchy Tuba melody and the Frog's ""Bug-Gup"" is adorable. My 3 year old can't get enough. He asks for the ""Oompah Oompah"" Book. Nice illustrations and great story."
5,Great Music,I have to admit to being a little perverse and singing along when it hits track 18 and Food Glorious Food
3,Oh my,"There is alot of penis in this movie, wow, the other reviews are all correct, more skin than the playboy channel, even late night showtime adult movies. Everything except actual penetration.As far as the rest of the movie this is far from standard hollywood movie direction, and it is film purposefull in this alternative style. For lots it is a let down, as the story line is very simple. Minimal dialog. If the direct was serious about this style of directing, it was a noble attempt with the subject matter. Otherwise this film is just soft porno.Interesting movie, to each their own money."
3,Entertaining,"An entertaining if not interesting short film about two young lovers who manuever through the tricky world of lust and love...good graphic trysts between the two main characters, but sometimes left you wondering more about the depth of the characters and what exactly they were feeling. Which might not be a bad thing...Take it for what it's worth: a graphic and short, lustful story about two young lovers experiencing feelings for each other they don't immediately know how to handle."
2,over rated,"An interesting film about a sexually charged woman who takes control of the situations. It is all right, but the film is really more in the amateur category than of a finely crafted film. Some obvious gaps in continuity, perhaps due to the short shooting schedule. Avoid the commentary, as the director is so full of himself, and Lauren Smith mainly laughs and giggles.On the positive side, a lot of the movie is conveyed without dialogue, and I am referring to the tension between the characters.Are the people attractive? Yes. Is the story conveyed interestingly? Pretty well. Are there better movies to spend 93 minutes with? Yes. Was it a wasted 93 minutes? Not really."
3,Not worth the money,For the amount of money paid for this and how long it took to ship. This is definetly not worth the money. I bought it for a Christmas present and then found out it can be downloaded on line for a much cheaper price.
2,Doesn't Work,"As far as the game is concerned, from what I was able to play on the demo, it is a great game, however, upon purchasing the game and attempting to install it, I found that the game uses something called Star Force Protection which is simply a copy protection that has a small piece of software that is installed on your computer without your knowledge and is completely incompatible with Windows Vista (like everything else.) I have made every attempt possible to rectify the situation. I have attempted to contact Monte Christo Game as well as the Star Force company to no avail. My only hope at this point is that Windows 7 is going to save the day. Can't wait."
5,Great game for any firefighter or ems!,"I am proud to say that I serve my community here in Niagara County in Western New York as a Firefighter and an EMT. I always kind of wondered, however, on MCIs (Mulitple Casuality Incidents) how hard it is for the command officer to take charge and get things done. I did not know what it would be like. I guess this showed me!"
1,Don't waste your money.,I got this game and it did not come with an activation code. When I downloaded it on to the computer it kept coming up with an error code and would not let me play at all. THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!
1,Emergency Fire Response,The game is a bust. This game is so unrealistic it is unbelievable. The game should allow the user to assign tasks to various crews and not have to click 30 thousand times in the same area to extinguish a fire.
3,"Run-of-the-mill, overly complicated game","I picked this up when it first came out as an addition to a Battletech campaign series. The history and detail were good, with a handy split between basic and advanced rules, though some of the latter weren't really necessary and only detracted from game play. The main problems with this game were that the card pieces were cheap and ugly (which took away from the fun), campaign rules were sloppy and complicated, and ship statistics were far too detailed. Fasa should have streamlined the combat system for space, instead of just making the ships really big battlemechs with bigger guns. If you're looking for an addition to your Battletech universe games, check it out (some of the historical refight scenarios in the book aren't bad), but if you want a good space wargame, go for Battlefleet Gothic or Full Thrust."
4,Nice if you can use it,"Since all gamers are looking for a way to spice up their games, Battlespace offers a great way to expand the Battletech universe. Works well if you own the 3057 Readout Dropships, Jumpships, And Warships."
1,Crapy,I didn't look at anything I wanted to find a book on the steel vipers from the BattleTech series which I know exsits and I tried to review it and couldn't find thanx for nothing
4,"Actually bad, but cultic and unbelievably entertaining!","For me DANGEROUSLY CLOSE is one of those films, which are absolutely underrated!AVENGING FORCE, AMERICAN NINJA, AMERICAN GOTHIC... al those films are of the same class and contain some very cultic elements which make these films very worthy!Relative 4 stars!"
1,Cannon Group SUCKS!!!,"John Stockwell, a terrible actor with forgettable moments in movies like Losin' It and Christine were god awful. No wonder why this production company went under. Thank god that the like the passing of the 80's, so has the Cannon Group that makes such horrible films, with the exception of the cheesy Ninja Movies. Don't waste your money on this video, it will show sometime on HBO at 3:30 am when your when can't sleep, and trust me, this will have you sleeping in time. The movie is obviously a cheap rip off of the Keanu Reeves made for t.v. movie ""Brotherhood of Justice,"" which is made a little better with the likes of Keither Sutherland."
1,"Two words -- ""ECHO CANCELLATION""","This phone met all my requirements... It was 2.4GHz, had caller id... message indicator light ... headset jack... and the price was great... so what was the catch?You can't use this phone unless you are in the cone of silence with absolutely no background noise. This phone picks up every bit of background noise on your end and amplifies it through the earpeace. My friends now think my favorite word is ""huh"", because I have to ask them to repeat themselves every two seconds.SAVE YOUR MONEY... stay away until the old AT&T (circa 1980) manufactures this phone correctly."
1,Sound quality is poor,I would have to agree with the other reviews which I have read. The sound quality is poor on this phone. There is also some feedback noice on the phone which is very annoying.
2,Save your money,"I have owned 6 cordless telephones, 3 with 2.4 Ghz, and this is by far the worst for sound quality. It sounds like a kid's toy, really tinny and echo-y. The noise level changes significantly as we walk around the house but is never very good. Save your money."
5,This C.D. Rocks!,"A friend of mine introduced me to this ""record"", ""back in the day"" (around '84-'85) and I've been searching for it since! It's the kind of CD you can't listen to just one song on, you know, one track leads to the next, and so on. This is some good, rockin' stuff! If you like Motorhead, (old)Metallica, English Dogs, Angelic Upstarts...stuff kind of like that, not too fast, just rockin'...you'll love this. Anyone who grew up listening to ""Punk"" or ""REAL"" Heavy metal should definitely own this. e-mail:g13raider@aol.com(keep e-mail anon)"
3,"BLOOD, GUTS & BEER!!","Blood, Guts & Beer has been my theme song for many years. This record is great, total Motorhead style, pre-thrash British metal. Algy Ward did time with The Saints and plays on my favorite Damned album - Machine Gun Etiquette. The first 3 Tank albums are all good, but this is the best one. Hope you can find one that's not too expensive.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City."
4,Thorough and fundamental.,"This book covers the fundamentals of legal writing so thoroughly and carefully that it could well substitute for many first-year legal-writing texts. Its approach may strike experienced writers as too traditional or too basic. Still, for the novice it will provide a solid grounding in legal-writing style, legal analysis, legal memos, letter writing, and persuasive writing. Many practicing lawyers would do well to heed the teachings in this book.One critique: Persuasion is so common in law schools' first-year, legal-writing courses that this Nutshell probably had to cover it. But it covers it cursorily and might well have left it out. Persuasive writing is a topic that can (and does) fill entire books."
3,Not like dear old Dad's,"While ""La Dame"" is a very good romance and a nice read, it can't compare to the far superior works of the author's Father, Alexandre Dumas, Pere.For the real thing read dear old Dad's."
1,Silly story,I don't like to criticise so negatively but this has no humor and is definitely not on the level of the elder Dumas. I would like to sell mine but the prices are too low and not worth a PO trip. I just want to enter another opinion but recognize that I am in the minority among the others responding. So buy the book and see for yourself. It is very easy reading and I suppose was easy to write.
3,I did not received what i reilly order,"I order the OST OF Thief and the image back and front of the CD was showing that,but i got the CD without Graig Safan 2 tracks of Final Confrontationwich is not the original soundtrack !"
3,WHAT A GLARING OMISSION!! JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE!!,"As the previous post mentions, this CD release does NOT include the closing piece ""Confrontation"" which was the entire impetus behind my buying the lp years ago!! If you've seen the climatic ending of the film, the music's swelling guitar work adds so much to capping the mood - - it works the same on the album and I can't even fathom what emptiness it would be not to have it on the CD. Not to say there isn't some great edgy work besides, but I surely would of put this in at 4 1/2 or 5 stars if ""Confrontation"" would have been included. The tune was not written by any of the three band members so maybe there's some copyright problems behind this, but WHAT a disappointment...."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is Tangerine Dreams's best work. Truly a timeless classic, and certainly well worth the investment."
5,"Early Tangerine Dream, but still the best ever!","I first heard this music while watching the movie ?Thief?. Although the movie was good, the music was better. I quickly went out and bought the LP sound track(this was before CD's). Then I discovered the group responsible for this audio masterpiece was Tangerine Dream. Since the advent of the compact disc I have searched for the same title in CD and was unable to find it until now! In my search I have acquired several other CD's of Tangerine Dream, but none compare to this sound track. My turn table is old and now broken and all I have is the scratchy LP and memories. I am anxiously awaiting my order from Amazon.com.?P?Dan Prinzing"
1,"where is ""confrontation""????","I purchased this thinking I'd be getting the piece that is performed as the end credits are rolling. I was angry when I received this. I wasted my $25 on this crappy album. ""Confrontation"" was on the cassette tape I owned ten years ago. I will never forget it. Tangerine Dream is, to me at least, usually emotionless synth garbage. Most of the songs on this soundtrack exemplify that. But ""Confrontation"" is a glorious piece!!! Inspiring. And it's NOT on this very expensive import. Why would they omit that track!!?? A CD with that song alone, would rate 5 stars. This incarnation, however, rates 1 star."
1,Confrontation,"The only reason to purchase the soundtrack to The Thief is for the feature song ""Confrontation"" which is NOT ON THIS ALBUM!!!Save your money, there are much better Tangerine Dream albums available."
1,Missing Song,"I want the soundtrack because of the song in the Bar scene, I believe it is ""Turning Point"" but not sure. Can anyone tell me who did this song and where I can buy it? SSTEWART001@charter.net"
5,"Spectacular, Confrontation",If you haven't heard the movie...do it. Listen to the closing tune. Excellent!Beach Scene theme is really good. I miss Confrontation.
3,"Regarding the missing track ""Confrontation""......","The reason this track was left off of the CD is because the song was not performed by Tangerine Dream. ""Confrontation"" was written by Craig Safan (I believe the same guy wrote the ""Cheers"" theme, if you can believe it) and performed by unknown musicians. Certainly Tangerine Dream did not contain a guitarist capable of performing on ""Confrontation.""An interesting note: The UK edition of the original LP did not contain ""Confrontation,"" but rather included ""Beach Scene"" from the soundtrack. The US LP excluded ""Beach Scene"" in favor of ""Confrontation."" The current version of the CD restores the release to its originally intended form."
2,"""Thief"" ?? More like ""Theft"".","""Theft"",as in, ""They stole a great song."" The song in question is ""Confrontation"". When I bought the vinyl LP back many, many years ago, it was mainly due to that song. I loved it. Recently, when I came across this import CD, I immediately bought it. I didn't remember the name of the song I liked so much, simply because I haven't owned a turntable for what seems like eons, so checking the track list would've been futile. Stupid me, I just took for granted that it was the same record. I've read comments defending the reason for the song's absence, most notably that this is a Tangerine Dream album, and ""Confrontation"" was not performed by the band. Uh....excuse me...did I miss something? This is a SOUNDTRACK TO A MOVIE, not a TD album. True, they performed most of the material, but it's still a soundtrack. The deletion of one of the most powerful songs from the movie is a complete waste, and so is this version of the soundtrack. Where's a turntable when you need one?"
3,"Hard plastic, not flexible, limits usability","Seller was great, fast ship, fair price. The item, on the other hand...I'm sure this will work in a lot of applications, perhaps most, but it wouldn't work for me. No size to fit Craftsman belt/disk sander vacuum port (probably Craftsman's fault, I don't think their dust port is a standard size)."
1,a bargain for its usefulness,"it serves both to bigger dust collection and smaller dust collection. there are many diameter options at our hands. i needed the 6"" to 5"" and 2-1/2"" to 2"" reducers and did not have to buy two of them so i saved money. a must."
2,Hardly used and tip already decaying.,"Just got this and has only been used a handful of times. I don't think I used this under particularly high heat, but front tip of spatula is already breaking down/melting. Nice shape though. Wish someone would make nonstick that was truly heat resistance."
4,My son is growing into this book,"My son received this book as a gift when he was eight monthsold. The first thing he did was to pop it in his mouth--and with fourteeth he succeeded in giving it some good bite marks. I rescued it before he could take a bite out of any of the shapes, but I believe that he could have.Now that he is outgrowing the Must-Put-New-Thing-In-My-Mouth phase (ten months) he really enjoys the book. He loves to take the shapes out of the book (one by one at mom's insistance!) and turn them over and over in his hands and look at them from all sides. He also likes to turn the chunky but light pages and he is learning to point at the shapes when I say the corresponding sentence (""Find the yellow triangle,"" for example). I only wish there were more than four shapes in the book.In short, I would recommend closely monitoring babies in the heavy chewing phase while they have this book, but it seems to be a great way for children to learn shapes and colors."
2,who needs loose pieces?!?!,"love the idea of the soft book that baby can look at the play with by herself, but loose pieces - NO! pieces that come out/off and a baby are not a good mixture. keeping up with them is such a pain! i like the book and my little girl has fun chewing on it, but i gave up on trying to keep the shape pieces with the book"
4,Research based standards for Reading Coach/specialists,"Any one taking a course in Reading I would recommend, 'Standards for Reading Professionals' to them; it gives lots of valuable information and references."
4,professional library worthy,This book is an excellent tool for reading teachers as well as reading coaches/literacy specialists/etc. A must have for your professional library shelf.
5,Reading Specialists and Literacy Coaches in the Real World,"I received the book a couple days later than estimated. However, I think it was due to the snowstorm."
2,I have seen better,"This book is good for the very basics. But when I travel I like to make a serious effort at communicating in the local language. Other books are better for that purpose than this one. If all you want are the very basics, then perhaps this book will fullfill your needs."
3,Incomplete book,The copy of this book which I received was apparently incomplete (It finished with an uncompleted sentence in the middle of his journey). I have tried with absolutely no success to obtain complete version!
5,Amazing,"Since I am a great fan of Los Lobos and everything Pacheco, I can't believe that no one ever recommended this DVD to me! Being three brothers certainly has helped them forge together a very tight band.Maybe not so much in this performance but on later songs, I even hear a strong influence of Maná, my favorite Puerto Rican rock group. (I hear the Police coming through Maná.)Even though you can hear influences, they manage to form their own distinctive performance style. I especially love the way JoJo and Henry dance together while playing."
5,Los Lonely Boys show they are better live! Kicks major a**!,"You know, Los Lonely Boys's self-titled platinum debut is a great album, one that harkens back to the days of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Duane Allman. But as great as that album is, this is where LLB does their best: in front of their loyal and rapid Loopies and Lonlies. Here, we find the boys playing in front of 25,000 people in their musical hometown, Austin, Texas, during the SXSW festival. They play a great set, and are full of energy. Even on the slower songs, it makes you nod your head. This shows that they are truly one of the best bands to come out in the new millenium. Also, the bonus features are really hilarious and interesting. From Henry's Sean Connery impression to Ringo's meeting of his third-grade teacher, they continue to entertain, even without the instruments. This band is going to be a band that is around for a long time to come. (...)"
2,can't calibrate,the Extech EA25 EasyView Hygro-Thermometer and Datalogger funtion properly but we can't calibrate the tester and for my company is necesary the calibration.
4,good version of an enjoyable work,"Le Prophete is the Meyerbeer work ""par excellence"" that Wagner saw as the most egregious example of all that was bad in Meyerbeer , ie empty calculated showy effects without real drama or thought through musical development.nevertheless it is fun and has some real show stoppers (eg Coronation March , skaters ballet, stirring choruses and Fides' aria).I think there is only one other recorded version. I have the vinyl as well but it is worn. the recording is a bit brash, both artistically and technically but this suits the work."
5,great stuff,"again, we have been looking for this product in our local stores and they do not carry the product anymore, so we found it on amazon and are so happy we did!!"
3,price was outradgious,the product is very good but you r ripping off the customer with the price. I own a small busines and I use it [the LOUIE SAUCE AS WE CALL IT] on ONE of my 525 + WINGS that we sale.
1,"Adventure Guide to Anguilla, Antigua, St. Barts, St. Kitts,",I am sorry but this was worthless. All the information in this book is on the internet. This book brings no value to a traveler going to any of these locations.
1,Buy Frommers or Fodors instead,I was very disappointed with this guide book. I've bought a lot of guidebooks and have never seen one as general as this one. The information contained in Fodors or Frommers big Carribean books give better coverage to St. Kitts which is what I was interested in learning about.
2,Out of Date,"Dec 2006 - Just finished 7 days on nearly all islandsin this book. Maps and general info. ok.Other info out-of-date.Saw a 2007 travel book just released (Frommers?).Summary, get a more current and up-to-date guide forthe Lesser Antilles.Lesser Antilles is a great place to visit. You wantto do fancy - it is very expensive.Otherwise, did not find costs outrageous."
3,"Decent Clock but Lighting Feature is ""dim""witted","Clock functions work fine, programming is common sense and the price is good. I was disappointed in the lighting feature which was very, very dim."
5,Same as Four Pillars of Healing,"This book is the exactly the same as his previous book ""The Four Pillars of Healing"", just in paperback and with a new cover. You save a few bucks by getting this paperback edition."
5,Two Thumbs Up!,"Backyard Wonders by Nancy MacCoon is a delightfully written and beautifully illustrated book. It contains factual information about backyard critters written in a way that is easily understood and enjoyed by children, as well as, adults. I use Backyard Wonders in my elementary classroom to acquaint and excite the children about life found in our own backyards. It is truly a fun book!"
5,"A smart, beautiful book teaching wonder for the everyday","Our 2 1/2 year old loves the pictures. We love the facts about everyday backyard animals. From bats to pill bugs, it's an educational book that will grow with our son and, we hope, make him feel wonder for creatures often overlooked because they are so close to home. Bravo!"
1,Boring and the controls stink,"Good thing I only payed $3 for this game, Unrealistic and difficult to control the views and play.Lame"
2,The C64 80's version was better,"The game looks promising when you buy it. When you play it, it's frusterating. Not to mention the military continuity errors.In the booklet, The main character goes to West Point Military Academy, but comes out enlisted, as a corporal? In the game he is a Sargent. Doesn't make sense.Problem with the game is the Enemy soldiers are stupid and so are your own! You soldiers don't return fire or initiate fire until you order them to (You can now download a patch from the game's website to correct that, among other problems).I recommend, if you can find it a C64 emulator and the Commodore 64 version of the game."
1,Boring! Boring! Boring!,"Thank God I got the Demo off Gigex.com! Geez! I hate these kind of games... Mind you, I'm into action games and FPS where you get to jump into the action. This game isn't one of those. This is one of those boring games where you have to plan everything and move this soldier here and that soldier there... Gimme a break! If you like these kind of games, fine. But if you're like me and you like fast action and adventure, don't waste your money."
3,Good information but ...,"I have both Vol. 1 and 2, they both have useful information, but you can only watch a little at a time, Huckabee's delivery is so monotonish that he puts you to sleep. Both videos could use a booklet of lyrics and/or chord charts to make it easier to follow along also."
4,"Wonderfully Written, A Classic!","My son and I really enjoyed this book. We were lucky enough to get an advanced copy of this book a couple of years ago at a NCTE conference. My son took it to class for ""Book Day"" and all the students enjoyed it too. What makes this book unique is that this is a tall tale about a young African American girl. It's a lesson to all children that heroes/heroines come in all sizes and colors!!"
4,a fun tall tale,"This is a good book for young children- especially young black girls. A strong heroine to breath fresh inspiration and courage to young minds. OK, and it's just fun to read and look at too!"
3,Was expecting better...,"I have owned and listened to The Innocent Age for many years and was looking for another album to expand my music collection. The many positive review led me to purchase Netherlands.After the Innocent Age, this album falls short. This is one of his earlier offerings and is not his best. In several tracks, Dan is singing in too high a key, and the vocals are strained and not pleasant to listen to. For me, this CD was just okay - not the masterpiece that others believe it to be.I'll keep looking..."
5,Reminiscing Youth,"My High School Prom came and went on a 1981 summer night. I never attended, and I never kept in touch with old friends. Someone told me that the name of the Prom Night Song had been ""SKETCHES"".I was sorry I missed the Prom and also sorry I had never heard that song. The thought of logging on to the Internet at Amazon.Com 19 yrs later to search for a ""CD"" I had heard that night would've sounded like science fiction. Once I finally got the CD, I heard it and I listened to track #10 for the first time since then.I LOVE THIS CD. Dan Fogelberg is a true artist and a 1 of a kind!"
1,Bombastic in the extreme,"Bombastic in the extreme, Fogelberg's fourth album has enough overwrought orchestrations to choke a Moody Blues fan several times over. A song like ""Dancing Shoes"" is pretty, but some of this stuff is pretentious beyond belief."
5,great as always,dan's albums before this had a mix of thick and thin songs this is a really thick sound in a good way the lyrics are still his the production is heavier but not overpowering a real sleeper get 2
4,Loved the orchestration of this album!!!,"I was introduced to this album, namely the song ""Dancing Shoes"" by my sophomore French Teacher in 198...whatever. I will always remember ""Suzi's"" excitement when she said, ""listen to this Kim, isn't it beautiful?"" From that day forward, I was a big fan of Dan. I'm still a fan of Suzi's too..."
5,Classic,I was introduced to this album in the late 70's by my step-mother and have loved it for over 20 years. It is one of the most masterful pieces of music I've ever heard. If you're a Fogelberg fan but don't have this album you are missing out big time.
5,Night trap review,"This a long overlook film with good actors and for us spook movie fans a good one to add to your collection. Enjoy, I did."
1,Bells and Whistles but poor sound !,"My wife bought this phone for us two days ago. While this phone (the 9371) has all the bells and whistles on it, the sound quality is not there at all. There is a slight fuzzy sound surrounding both party's talking. Also, the handset to me, was not comfortable at all. I reboxed it this morning. This one's going back to the store today."
1,Disappointing,"This phone looked like a good alternative for people with wireless networks who want to avoid 2.4GHz interference but don't want to pay the inflated prices for 5.8GHz phones. It has useful features like answering machine and speakerphone. But the sound quality is very poor, even distorted. Callers sound like they are at the bottom of a deep well. You can hear an echo of your own voice in the handset along with a constant buzzing. As 900MHz phones get phased out, it looks like there will be no good alternative to 5.8GHz."
2,Speakerphone died after about a year,It sounded garbled and staticky when using the speakerphone and the caller id lcd screen broke. It is unreadable as well. Didn't last long.
3,"Great design, but easily broken","I loved this phone. I loved it so much I've purchaced 2 of them. Now I'll admit, I'm rough on phones, but both managed to become unusable within one year of purchace. That is really my only gripe.Now the good stuff. The design is good. I like the phone, the number of mailboxes, the answering system was great. The caller ID was a tad slow, but not any more than my other caller ids. Overall it was a good phone, but not meant for long term hard heavy usage."
2,Seemed Fine But Went Downhill Fast,"I bought this phone after reading some reviews that made it sound like a wonderful buy for the cost. But once again, you get what you paid for and this phone was a waste of money and time. The sound comes in and out, the range is horrible and it isn't a very comfortable phone for long conversations."
2,pretty junky,"this thing probably isn't worth it, even for this small price. sound quality is middlish, the caller ID screen went out within a year, it's IMPOSSIBLE to figure out what all the buttons do -- I mean AT&T, c'mon, put a little effort in DESIGN! really, simple things like setting the time and changing your outgoing message are really hard. luckily amazon has a link to the product manual, or I would have thrown it away a long time ago."
5,"""This is a CLASSIC""","Deniece Williams' first album is a classic debut by a talented vocalist and songwriter. When I first heard ""Free"" I couldn't get enough. The melody and arrangement grabbed me right off and Niecy's vocals seared her declaration of independence in my musical memory for years to come. This jam is timeless and the album is a classic. It's mix of jazz-inflected soul (""Free""), Earth, Wind and Fire (Maurice White's influence) funkiness (""It's Important to Me"") and soulful reflection (""That's What Friends Are For,"" ""If You Don't Believe""). And Niecy witnesses to the listener that somebody is ""Watching Over"" you. I have always admired Niecy's talent and her conviction to include in her albums a tune to touch your spirit. This is the first of many great albums by a very talented performer. A CLASSIC debut effort."
5,This is Nicey,Love the Entire album bought it back in 1976 and I still have it as of today. My favorite song is free blows you out of the water she sings the song so creamy and beautiful.
3,Niecy,"I was so delighted to see Deniece Williams album entitled ""This Is Niecy"" released on CD. Deniece Williams is a phenomenal singer with her 4 octave vocal range. My favorite song is ""Free"".A song about love and being free to express to yourself freely to your mate. A song that I can identify with myself. How awesomely free indeed. Other songs that I like are; Cause You Love Me Baby, How'd I Know That Love Would Slip Away and That's What Friends Are For. This album was produced by Earth,Wind & Fire lead singer Maurice White."
4,Free!,"You know her music. You're moved by her voice. What are you waiting for? Free yourself and add this to your collection. The ""Free"" track is unlike any other piece and makes this CD an essential."
3,it's okay... at least it's digital,"Since it was our first digital answering machine, anything could impress us! So basically it's easy to use and that's good enough for me, I'm not planning on replacing it anytime soon. My only complaint is that if there is a power outage, you lose the correct time and also the date,... so it's all off until you reset it."
2,Pretty awful game!,"Well I was first drawn into the game because of my love of ""The Sims."" (Plus EBgames was selling it for 5 bucks, know I know why!)Like the Sims you are able to interact with the environment and other people but it is a very limiting game due to the specific number of interactions and items available. It's fun for the first 10 minutes then you realize that there's not much difference in gameplay. It's pretty redundant. You make sure needs are met, click the same buttons to win the case, which isn't hard. Soon you find that you're just clicking buttons in a certain order over and over again.*One of the most annoying things about the game is that unlike the Sims where you can change the settings to ""see"" through the walls, you can't do that in this game so your character might be doing something but you can't see it because of the wall."
2,Just OK,This game is like a no-frills version of The Sims. You're constantly rushing to complete one tedious task before you have to do it all over again.
2,A little disapointing,"Comfortable grip, well finished overall. Blade seemed a little thick and not as sharp as I expected. A little whetstoning helped, but took some force to penetrate soft pine in my first attempt at chipcarving."
2,Seriously lacking 2-line features,"Beware if you are thinking of buying this phone: there is only one outgoing message, and the answering machine does not distinguish at all between the two lines. So you cannot disable answering on one of the lines or have one line automatically routed to a different mailbox. In my opinion that makes this phone useless for a two-line home or office."
1,Broke within 1 Year,"This phone started out great. Then within 1 year the answering machine started cutting off incoming messages or not recording them at all. Also, the phone no longer connects correctly with the base so it is difficult to get it to charge. Not a happy customer."
2,Poor support,This product is difficult to configure and when sending repeated requests for support I never got the help I needed. The responses looked like they never bothered to read my question. The response looked like a canned response that didn't relate to my problem. Like many products of this type they provide so much checking and blocking that performance is greatly affected. There are better products that are out there that are free. Seehttp://personalfirewall.comodo.com/
1,Creationist Dogma Extras,"You would think this was just a cute video - but my daughter went to tears as we had to watch a ""hunter"" kill a cougar with multiple shots from his pistol - what POOR taste in a ""nature"" video. BUT worse, this video seems to be a cover for anti-evolution creationist ""science"" as you would learn from all the DVD extras. Go rent or buy any of the wonderful David Attenborough DVDs instead (The Living Planet, The Life of Birds, The Life of..., Life on Air, and MANY more). David brings you the REAL science and wonder of nature - like nobody else."
3,"Good DC new ""mod/r & b""","I was a fan of Kim Thompson's bands Cupid Car Club and Apehouse, and didn't even realize she was in The Delta 72 when I picked up this CD. Overall, it's a solid entry in the burgeoning Washington DC ""Mod"" band scene (ok, it's them and the Make-Up...maybe that's not exactly burgeoning.) It's interesting to note that DC's similar band The Make-Up feature the other members of the band that used to be Cupid Car Club. On the whole, I'd say that this album is not quite on par with the Make-Up (I'm a sucker for any post Ulysses project!), but I certainly want to hear more from the Delta 72."
5,WoW!!!! Another Clue game!,"I'm a huge clue fan and I'll play that game every day if I could.This game is even better.In CLUE MYSTERIES, there are 50 different cases for you to solve in the rule book included with the game. Each case you must prove someone guility, like in the main game CLUE.Once you get the idea of the game it is very simple to play. My family and I play this game all the time and you'll want to too. It's just a very fun family game."
2,Missing pieces,My family was excited to play this version of the game as we have most of the version already but it was missing 4 pieces so we have to return it to the store.
5,Getting a bad rap!,"This ""album"", cd is getting a bad rap.Tower of power is just that a tower of power,from the first tune to the last,this is there trademark sound. Even with the changing of the lead singers,the cd sounds like and is a tower of power cd.You have to listen to the first tune to the last, this is R&B well done,not fried."
1,"McGee ""Slaughters"" Album","With Edward McGee's whiny vocal arrangements coupled with lyrics such as, ""I can't stand to see the slaughter, but still I eats the meat"", this album's ""chops"" are nothing but mindless butchery. The torture continues with sappy tracks like ""You Ought to be Having Fun"" and ""Make Someone Happy"". What would truly make me happy is throwing this album into a bonfire and roasting it to a crisp, golden brown. Eating this tainted ""meat"" will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Bon Appetite !"
3,Quick Note on an Old Favorite,"This book covers introductory Delphi 2 and is therefore dated (hence only 3 stars). Nevertheless, I found it to be an excellent primer on Delphi. The chapters all well written, and the examples are well fleshed out. The source code from the CD runs perfectly. The case study at the end of the book is worth reading for the humor alone."
4,A Good All-Round Reference,"This book is great for civil engineering students, even if you are not going to take the FE exam for a while. It is a simple yet thorough reference that will probably replace a lot of your old textbooks once you are finished with your classes. The only problem is that the answers/solutions to the exercise problems seem to be published in some supplementary text to be purchased separately. At least you will be able to sell back some of your old textbooks to help pay for it."
5,"Wonderful Review essential in passing EIT, but I have a bone to pick","I bought this in 1992 for the State of Washington EIT test at the price of $43. How the hell is this now $134 and it's the same damn edition, not to mention the print quality doesn't merit such a hefty pricetag? [read: it was recycled paper with crappy fonts]I lost my copy and many books in a storage flood. Hindsight is 20/20 and my careless nature due to a freak flood at WSU one winter is going to force me to fork out a lot more money than this damn text deserves.Only problem is that Lindeburg has a virtual monopoly on this type of examination."
2,I'd look for something else.,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. The information is 10 years old, the exam has changed quite a bit. I took the FE exam this semester and passed, but definitely not because of this book. I tried to study with it for about 4 hours and decided I was wasting my time. Yes it includes a lot of material, but I didn't really think the solutions adequately explained the problems. Also, the exam itself was way closer to the NCEES FE Exam practice problems than the problems in this book. They change the exam on a yearly basis, so a 10 year old book is not very relevant. If you're looking for a book to freshen up your technical knowledge before an interview, I would expect there are better books out there. The only upside to this book is that if you used, you should be able to pick up the book and the solution manual for under $50. For those preparing for the FE Exam, good luck! All in all, it really isn't too hard, just long."
4,He may have conquered Persia....,"....but he barely survived the sixth grade! My sixth graders love having visuals in class, and a bought Alexander so that we could have him as a guest star as we learned about Greece and Macedonia. The kids liked having him stand on their desks and I let Alexander visit some table groups as a reward to the kids. But eventually, he lost both forearms and I had to reattach them with wire. I don't think the kids meant to pull off Alexander's forearms, but he is more of a decoration than a toy that kids can manipulate and send off to battle. Anyway, the facial features are great and his accessories are fun. We have not lost those. All in all he is a fine toy but more for looking at or playing with carefully."
5,Polvo's best album,"Polvo's catalog is rich with challenging, tempting, engulfing melodies and rhythms. Exploded Drawing is their masterpiece, 18 songs that will transport you to another world. A true magnum opus from the most unique band of the 90's. This is a must-own."
5,Polvo are missed.,"Polvo: Lots of interesting guitar sounds, time changes, lyrics that make you think. I really enjoy this entire album, but it isn't an ""easy"" listen. If you do not like to be challenged by your music, do not listen to Polvo. If you're looking for a type of music you've never really heard before, music which will leave you feeling different than before you listened to it, than this is the album for you!"
2,well.,"the only good song on this cd is the very first one, ""fast canoe."" I love that song. I bought that cd after hearing only that one song and decided that it was the only one worth hearing. Although, I've only listened to it once....maybe I was just too hasty. ""fast canoe"" rules though. It is so sincere and expresses what I feel. If you listen to it you'll like it."
2,BEWARE!,"I have always been very pleased with this product. I would literally see results overnight when I put a tiny bit of gel on a zit. However, when I recently ordered two more tubes of the stuff, they arrived in record time but were EMPTY. Both tubes! I immediately contacted the seller by phone as well as through Amazon.Good news: my money was refunded the very next day, and the customer service was excellent. Bad news: the guy who contacted me checked the Men's Direct warehouse and found all their remaining tubes were empty as well. I recommend ordering from aMENity directly, to (hopefully) ensure quality product. Not sure why the tubes were empty... quality control issue, or perhaps the gel somehow dried up? Anyway, for the price it's worth it because it works, but of course that's only if the gel is there in the first place!"
2,On the way downhill,"Back in the day I was a HUGE MOA? fan, but unfortunately, this ep sucks compared to previous albums. This one marked the beginning of the end of my MOA? fascination. It does have the coolest, most innovative album art with the transparent paper and all, for that i give it 2 stars."
5,Best shave cream ever!,"I have been using this product for a few years and have always had great results! No more razor burn!! I've tried every shaving cream, lotion, etc. on the market. This one is the BEST! Say goodbye to razor burn...regardless of what razor you use!"
1,Bad machine,"Everyone who has written in is correct. This is not a good machine. The first one I got did not work, so I figured it was a lemon. I exchanged it. The second one worked for a month or so and then lost its ability to play back complete messages remotely. It just cut out part way thru message, but message(s) was/were there when I got home. ATT has now sent me a third machine and it is set up. Figure I have a month to decide what to purchase next. I too would score it a ""zero"" if only I could."
1,Bad machine,"The sound is horrible. Messages are saved when someone calls, but they can't be retrieved. Remote anwering codes quit working. A piece of junk."
1,"the rating is really a ""0""","This is the worst machine I have ever owned, would have given it a ""0"" rating but the rating scale won't let a person rate the low. It worked fine for the first month, but into the second month after that the messages became garbled and and progressively worse intill you could not understand the messages at all,it seemed like the more messages I recieved the worse it became. I deleted the messages to make sure that the machines mailbox wasn't just too full, but that was to no avail. This was in a three month time period. I don't know how well the remote feature worked for I never needed to use it. I would save the money and buy a different brand, unless you love the sound of people under water..hehe."
2,Still looking for a decent answering machine,"I find this machine to be usable when I'm home; but when I access it remotely with my cell phone, the voice quality issue is REAL TOUGH! Need to find a 'hearable' answering machine somewhere--the old tape units weren't great, but were definitely better than this!!"
3,"Not great, but not unredeemable.","If you're looking for a machine that's very affordable and that you're primarily going to use to check your messages at home, then you might consider this machine. It's true that the sound quality is not the greatest, but I've had no real problem understanding any messages.Remote access is dodgy, especially with a cell phone. The audible time/date stamp with each message just gives you a day of the week, not a date; hence old messages sound as though they came through just that week.If you are a ""power user"" and frequently check your messages from afar, this is not for you. If you need a rudimentary system to grab your 3 or 4 messages a week just to make sure you don't miss anything important, then give it a shot."
4,The MSM Miracle,"Thanks, I was pleased with the book, it has the info that I was searching for. I have recommended this publication to other as well."
3,"Great idea, a little expensive","I really like this product. Although I believe this product is a little expensive (slightly cheaper now than when I purchased), I am sure that we have saved money on electricity. From Oct. 1 to Jan. 1, we have Halloween and Xmas decorations running. Our configuration makes it difficult to get to the plugs, especially at night when you are ready for bed already. So we left the electronics on over night from time to time. Now, we just turn them off remotely.Cons: the outlet unit will cover both outlets in most cases. The flat, wide design also prevented me from plugging directly into an outside outlet. My outlets are slightly recessed so the rubber gasket can cover them when not in use. I have not been able to find outlet units by themselves."
4,Good Product.,"This product works as advertised. I was able to simply program multiple units to the same push button. The range is also very good, and I'm able to control a downstairs unit from the opposite side of the house upstairs. The bottom of the unit obstructs the lower outlet of the pair, so only one plug-in can be used. Otherwise, this is 5 stars. I would have preferred that they use the 418 MHz RF range, so I could have controlled this with a universal remote - a minor personal preference."
4,the remote control outlet,"This system works very well, the only thing I don't like is it can only take one plugged in thing at a time into it, and when you put the whole thing in the wall outlet, it is so bulky that you cannot use the 2nd plug of the wall outlet because this thing hangs down in the way. I still use it though, and have bought several, and use them in the main areas of the house."
5,Freakin Sweet Dude!,"I am a lazy ass and always dreamed of controlling my room from my bed. And now I can. The reomote system works really well, I have no complaints (I usually always do). The remote is easy to use, and I can even use it all around my house. Its also great for setting the mood-- girls love it! Its a necesity for all lazy asses and wanna be players."
1,Worst Phone Ever Made,"This is possibly the worst phone I have ever owned. I have returned it once and it worked for a few months, just long enough for the warranty to run out. I am still having the same initial problems. One handset always claims to be ""out of service"" and the other set is almost always dead. I never have a phone when I need one. It is also very fuzzy and difficult to use. Don't waste your money!"
3,Good looks / Great concept / Only fair sound quality,"This phone looks very nice, has good features and is light and easy to hold. The quality of the sound with noticeable background noise is disappointing. To date, the best phones that we have purchased - no matter the price, in terms of sound quality have been the Panasonic.."
2,Think twice or more before buying,"At first it worked fine, although battery life was low. When the original Nicads gave out I bought NMIH batteries. Note: No one should use Nicads anymore.Anyway, after less than 3 years the LCD of one of the phones has become unreadable. I called AT&T; and they just said buy new phones."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this product so that I could have a phone in my Florida room and in my sun room. The battery has no lasting power at all and after 4 months they would not function at all.
1,Disappointing,"Thinking the AT&T company name was reliable, and liking the price for a dual handset model, I bought this set. I put one handset in my home office, and the other downstairs in the family recroom. Initially things seemed to work well, although the sound volume was a bit low even at the highest setting. As the months passed, reception got worse, and there were strange beeps in the background at times (almost as though a fax machine was on the line, although there was no fax activity). After about 8 months they started going out intermittently, and the range droppped terribly. I also own a Panasonic cordless phone, which has been in my kitchen for several years, and which has worked flawlessly for all this time. I'm replacing these AT&T phones with another Panasonic."
4,Great Product,"I love this set of phones. It has many convenient features, not the least of which is you only need one phone jack. Also, the caller id and intercom are very straight forward, as well as conference calls. I have had this product for nearly 8 months and have never had a problem with either battery. I have found that a charge will last for about 5 days, not one call like the other review states."
2,do not buy,"batteries do not hold a charge after 3 months of use.Purchased new factory batteries and they did the same.reception is good,but the features are hard to use. I would not buy this phone again."
1,Great little phone - for the first couple weeks,"I've had the phone about a month and a half now - worked great the first few weeks. Now the handsets go dead after talking for about 20 minutes - been on the charger all night to boot. This morning went to answer the phone and it was dead! Nothing in the display at all! I've had AT&T send me new batteries and that got me a few more weeks, but all in all, they're just plain JUNK!!!"
2,Too Noisy for Me,"The AT&T 2230 appears to be a good deal if you have one phone jack but need multiple extensions, and the phones feel good in your hand and look pretty cool.Noise is a subjective thing, and it's clear a few folks below are satisfied with the sound quality. However, when I charged these phones up, I noticed an immediate increase in background buzz over my 10-year old Sony cordless, which was indistinguishable from a corded phone when you were within 50 feet of the base. I tried following a previous reviewer's advice to just kick up the volume (the buzz doesn't get any louder) but at that level I was holding the phone 3 inches from my ear. I called my wife at work and she noticed the buzz too. And I had made sure I was observing all the standard warnings about proximity to other devices, etc.I ended up returning the AT&T and spending more money for the Sony Quadrastation. Still some hiss relative to my old phone, but quiet enough relative to the AT&T that I'll keep it."
1,skip this phone,"I just returned this phone to where I bought it. I replaced it once, assuming it was a bad batch but the second exhibited the same problems as the 1st:There is a definate medium/high pitch 'buzzing' sound in the handset - clearly hearable in the background. The volume of the buzz does not change when changing the volume of the handset but it is annoying.Interestingly when using a headset the buzz is not their. Sounds to me that the transmitter is leaking signal into the speaker (maybe badly designed speaker wire path etc...).I replaced this phone with a Olympia OL 2400 (must be the same logic chip - menus are 90% identical - buttons - while located in different places are 100% identical). The Olympia is smaller, has a louder ring and does have a much much less noticable 'buzz'."
1,Terrible is all I can say.,"I bought this system thinking it would be a great convenince. However, although one phone worked beautifully (even if sometimes caller ID was slow - sometimes now showing up at all) and did not give me any problems; the other one had sporadic sound. I would be in the middle of conversation when all of the sudden I could not hear anything. Whomever I was speaking with could hear me clearly. I tried getting this fixed with the manufacturer, but basically got the runaround - ""Don't return this item, please call this number,"" then stay on hold for 30 minutes, get disconnected, call back, repeat until so frustrated you want to throw the phone - which probably would have fixed the broken one. Exchanged it for a second phone system at the local Target only to have the SAME problem (this time with both phones). Finally gave up and returned it!"
1,A waste of money!!!,I bought this set plus a base with answering machine. What a waste!!! I have returned it. Normally I use it only 15 feet from the base but would loose reception. Lots of noises and my voice sounded hollow. Like I was in a cave. People were constantly complaining about the phone when I was using it. Finally I packed it up and sent it back. I've gone back to my old Panasonic. My father bought the same phone and also returned his for the same reasons. A total waste of money. Buy something else.
1,Don't buy this phone,"I bought this phone and it has been the worst cordlessphone I've ever owned. The battery life is patheticallyshort. They recommend charging it in the baseever night. Even doing this it still (does not last long)after making a few phone calls. Also it seemsto get confused sometimes and squeals loudly. I thinkit can't communicate with the base, but the manualsays nothing about this.Don't buy this phone! Try Panasonic instead, I'vehad better luck with them."
1,Adam,"This is an awful phone. In addition to its strange design, it's very hard and confusing to use, and its range is practically nonexistent. The phone cuts out very close to the base. Do not buy this phone."
1,AWFUL!!!!,"These are the worst phones we have ever owned. Before the first one completely stopped working, it would cut off after two minutes of use, even on a fully charged battery. The second one has about a 6 minute life left to it. The phones have no reception outside of the house. Do not buy!!!"
1,Complete Junk!,"If you enjoy flushing your hard earned money down the toilet, this is the phone for you. Even if the price was $1 it would still be too expensive. Here are the problems:Sound is TERRIBLE. Not just bad, but absolutely TERRIBLE.Redial does not work.Occasionally, the person on the other end can not hear you.After about a month, the battery will only last about 7 minutes.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!"
2,"Good phone, bad charger","I found this phone easy to use, with good sound quality. The display is easy to read, the range is good, and it looks and feels of high quality.So why only 2 stars? The charger in one of the base units (the one connected to the phone line) overcharged the rechargeable battery in the handset. The resulting heat damaged the circuit board inside the handset and it stopped working. Now my dual handset phone is a single handset phone unless I buy another one. Of course, I realized all of this just after the one year warranty was up."
1,Very Unreliable,"This phone worked great for about four months. After four months, one phone began displaying the message &quot;Out of Order.&quot; After that message appeared, the phone never worked again - despite changing it's battery. The second phone lasted about two additional months before it began displaying the same &quot;Out of Order&quot; message. Someone should have indicated on the box that it was really a disposable phone!"
1,Disappointed,"My husband and I received this set of phones as a Christmas gift in 2003. We were very excited at first, but have come to find that the batteries have a very short life span, and they are not very durable. We are down to only one of the handsets as the other one was dropped by our 2-year-old and won't work. The working handset has to be charged daily, even if not used much. We are now looking for a new set of phones."
4,Great phone!,I have a living room with no phone jack. This is the perfect solution!! I have the main phone in the bedroom which is at the other end of the house and have the one that doesn't require a phone jack in the living room. All you need for the second one is a electrical plug. There is more than one ring tone for the phone and you can also transfer the call from one cordless to the other cordless. Both phones fit in both phone jacks so it doesn't matter if they get mixed up. The only thing it took a minute to get the battery to fit but my husband didn't have much problems so it might just be me :) and I wish you could have the option of getting more extentions but I didn't see where that option was avaliable. This is a much more inexpensive way than getting another phone jack installed and is a good quality phone. I wouldn't hesisitate in buying another one.
1,DO NOT BUY!...,"I love AT&T phones.... but this one is horrible!... Not user friendly, doesn't hold a charge long, hard to store and correct numbers, I can go on and on but, here's the best. After having it for 3 months it totally died and and they want [$$](after haggaling from [$$]) to replace it. The worst phone and waste of money! Don't say I didn't warn you!"
1,Don't buy,This phone was great for a few weeks then it fizzles. The batteries don't stay charged.. waste of money for us.
1,Wost phone I've ever had,"This is the worst phone we have ever purchased.After having it exactly 97 days one handset froze up and will not work at all.I took it back to Target-with the receipt,the box,and all the packaging-yet they refused to return it because I missed the 90 day deadline by SEVEN days.They would not even exchange it for the SAME phone.After calling the AT&T number given to me at Target-I was informed that this phone is made by American Standard-NOT AT&T,they make it in a foreign country and slap the AT&T logo on it.We still have not resolved this.Don't waste your money on this phone."
1,Worst phone ever: Batteries drain in 2 days of stand-bye,"Worst phone ever: batteries drain so fast I have to always leave it in the charger, defeating the purpose of a cordless phone on the coffee table.Menus are so difficult it takes a PHD to do a 'redial'Overall, 0 stars out of 5."
1,Does not hold charge,Found handsets constantly needing to be recharged. Could not leave handset off base at all. Phones always died in middle of conversations
4,Good All-Round Cordless,"This cordless phone had all of the features I was looking for.Good points include: Spread Sprectrum Technology, Belt Clip, Caller ID, Call Waiting ID, Intercom between handsets, True Speed Dialing, Mute (hold) feature, Volume control for both Ringer and Handpiece.Bad Points: Unit off base or charger, battery holds charge for ONLY 3 Days, Recharge takes 8 hours, talking distance from base is limited to 6 homes away, about 1 city block. I have owned an AT&T; 900 MHz. Spread Spectrum that would stay charged for 7 or 8 days off of charge before requiring charge, had as clear or slightly clearer voice transmission AND had a 1/3 mile range.Considering that that phone is no longer in production, this is in my judgement the next best phone. I give it ****."
2,Short battery life,"After about seven month of use, the phone must constantly remain in the charger. There is also a slight buzzing sound when on the phone. Look at a different phone."
1,Very poor product,No redeeming qualities - a total waste of money. I will never buy another AT&T; product.Battery only lasts a few hourssound quality is terrible - noisy with a constant echounreliableetc.etc.Stay far far away from this product !!!!!
1,Garbage - DO NOT BUY,"We have had 2 sets of these phones, one version with the answering machine. They both worked horribly. After about 2 months use, they don't hold a charge. Eventually, they became useless, not charging at all. We replacd them and he new ones did the exact same thing. The version we had with the answering machine would record an outgoing message that could barely be understood. We erased our personal message and left the default message on because at least it was understandable albiet distorted. DO NOT BUY THESE PHONES! You will regret it as we do."
1,Can't wait to get rid of it,"I hate, Hate, HATE this phone! I can only talk for 15 minutes before the battery goes dead. It goes dead off the charger after only 1 hour. I've already replaced the batteries once, but it still doesn't work. In addition, there is no volume control for the handsets and the volume is very low. I stopped using one of the headsets because of the battery and volume issues. The second one didn't seem to have these problems for about 4 days. Now it has all the same issues. In addition, that annoyingly loud beeping that goes off about once a week (the other day it woke my sick baby up at 4:30 AM). Even bad phones would call this a bad phone. I've only had this phone set for about 3 months. Run from this phone now. AT&T surely has gone downhill recently. It's so disappointing."
2,Don't purchase unless you like to listen to yourself talk...,"A few other reviewers have mentioned the ""echo"" when talking on these phones, and I completely agree. There was a very loud and noticable echo of your own voice when speaking. After only one day of talking on these phones, I couldn't stand it anymore, so I returned them. Don't waste your time with these."
2,didn't feel up to at&t standard,"This is the first at&t phone I had problems with. Problems with the phone included giving out a long tone when not in use. Also had problems where I couldn't be heard at all and no the mute button wasn't pressed by mistake. When not in use, the battery charge when left off the charger was no longer than 8 hours.While the shape was great to hold, if you have to rest the phone between your ear and shoulder (as in taking notes), the phone would very easily slide off onto the floor. Of course, this could be solved by using a headset, if you have one.Granted, I could of ended up with a lemon, but these are the problems I encounted with this phone."
2,Noisy,"This phone performed well for about the first 4 months. Then I started getting a lot of noise in the remote handset. I have tried turning off all my appliances and computer, and can't make the noise go away. It is somewhat intermittent, however. Maybe a neighbor has another 2.4 GHz device that is causing interference?"
1,Will not buy another AT&T phone,Purchased this phone about 6 months ago and it already is not working. Contacted AT&T about returning for repair or replacement and my dilemna is that I do not have the receipt since I mailed it to them for a rebate offer. So I e-mailed AT&T and explained that I do not have receipt and how should I go about getting the phone fixed and they responded by telling me to and said to forward the phone along with the Receipt. So obviously they didn't read my letter. Just fed up with a sorry phone and an uncooperative company to give me reliable advice.
2,poor battery,We bought this phone because we lived in older home and the only phone jack was in the kitchen. The extra handset and charger allowed us to put the phone in either the office or the bedroom without worring about the phone jack. However we quickly found the phone to have a very short battery life. We have delt with it for 2 years as we had spent a lot of money on it at the time (this sort of phone was new to the market) and the battery seems to be getting worse and worse. We are now looking at buying a new phone. But as we are now in a new apartment we at least have more phone jacks.
3,"good, but overrated","this is certainly better than lots of other anime series, however it's far from great. i agree with reviews that claim some episodes are a total waste of time. With the psycho-anime world getting more and more creative and sophisticated this series has yet to catch up."
5,magnificent phantasm,"From the delicious irony of the main intro theme, which derisively echoes the Lion King soundtrack (Disney lifted the concept, characters and storyline wholesale from Osamu Tezuka's Kimba The White Lion), to the manifold schizoid behaviors exhibited by the central players, we know we are in for a uniquely wild ride.Popular anime in Japan surpasses most narrative film in America, let alone its television fare (and our execrable cartoons of the past three decades barely warrant mention). This is an engrossing set which demands and rewards repeated viewings."
3,(3.5 stars) Less thought out than Kon's other titles,"Reality is jaded and confused in Kon's ""Perfect Blue"", which keeps the plot mysterious and thrilling. In Paranoia agent he goes further than confusing the viewer about who's perspective he is using; but it didn't click for me. Also, much of the mystery in this show comes from things that aren't even remotely explained. I don't want to go into details for sake of not spoiling anything for who ever reads this, but I'm pretty sure i understood what happened in the show and was rather turned off by the development of the plot. Paranoia agent is definately worth checking out, but is curiously enough over shadowed by an anime about a pop singer's rise to stardom; so maybe check it out on a free tv web site or get the boot leg because a hundred dollars is a lot for an anime these days."
3,seen better,"there are quite a few things i like about this title. good ideas, things that crack me up and social truths that come out in this.all in all it gets pretty boring though. after a few episodes the excitement over the angle of this show fades and it just kind of drags on with the occasional perk here and there."
1,Horrible Anime,"Out of all the anime I have seen in my life, what I have seen on TV of this crap is the worst anime EVER-- save your money.If you want good anime, get FLCL or DBZ Cell Games Saga."
5,Great value,"This is a compact imported set that only uses 2 discs (high capacity DVDs). You still get the entire series and get to save money. There are other sets that spread the episodes onto anywhere from 4 to 13 discs, but they tend to cost $100+"
4,TOOOO HARD ON SOME LEVEL,"I PLAY THIS GAME AND GOT STUCK ON ONE LEVEL I CAN'T BEAT IT ITS THE PART WHEN U CAN'T KILLED ANY SOLDGER OR U WILL LOSE IF U KILLED ONE OR MORE, GOT BORED PLAYING THAT LEVEL AND QUIT PLAYING IT, IT WAS ENTERTAINING ANYWAY, I GOT A GOOD COMPS SO THEY MOVE FAST, THE MOST DEADLY SOLDGER IS THE ARCHER I GOT KILLED 90% BY THEM, THE SECOND IS THE KNIGHTS, AND THE SWORDSMAN AND OTHER IS EASY NEVER GET KILLED BY THEM."
5,Great band's second best,"I cut my GVSB teeth on this one and the first listen didn't go well. At one point I was even going to sell it. But by then I started finding myself wanting to play it more and some more after that and the next thing I knew I loved every bit of it. Overall Venus Luxure is a better record but this is a close second. Favorite tracks: Click-Click, Wilmington, Zodiac Love Team, Super-fire."
2,"So-So, and uneventful","Although I was told by a girl at my work that GVSB rocked, I had to see for myself. Well, I was dissappionted. The albun is listenable maybe twice, then it serves better as background music. The album comes across as a mixture of ""16Volt"" and ""God Lives underwater"" all the while trying to be a little dancy. if you think pop is being run by acoustic guitars and mediocre vocals, well this album is definatly riding the similar NIN wave. Whispering trite vocals over thin loops, it just isn't very good, but of coarse, that is just my opinion."
2,needs subtitles,"This was a good season, not great, but definately enjoyable. However, not putting in subtitles really lessens the quality of the viewing. The previous seasons I put them on and could follow the fast dialogue, not so much here."
3,Not the best season,"Season 5 is, in my opinion, one of the worst in the show's history. Interesting character relationships and exciting medical drama took a distant backseat to slapstick comedy. (Lost bodies, horses crapping on people, doctors getting locked in CT rooms, and more.) Carter, always a sympathetic character, was suddenly being written as a heartless, brainless jerk, Lucy was a poorly developed and written character, and I, for one, couldn't care less about Doug's departure. (Mostly because Carol's refusal to go with him, while necessary for practical show-production reasons, was dramatically inexplicible. (""I love you and I want to marry you and have your child ... but I won't move to Seattle with you even though you have no career and no future left in Chicago because I have a job here!"" Like there are no hospitals in Seattle?))I'm sure most fans will buy it anyway, and as a completist, I probably will too, but I suspect I won't watch it much."
1,junk,I had ordered this some time ago and was just getting around to viewing it when I discovered that the discs were all corrupted. Can't even play them. Obviously a badly made copy. Do not purchase from this dealer. They sell trash.
3,ER Fan,"This wasn't as good of a season however, ER was a good series and that's hard to say about most TV today in my opinion. So, when nothing is on, I have this and other DVD series to watch."
2,subtitle disappointment,never got a chance to watch er when on tv love the show but very disappointed subtitles not in english just french??????????????? so much confusion in the shows that subtitles in english would help understand what is being said
5,5 STARS,GETTING TO KNEW WAS A AWESOME SHOW TO WATCH. I LOVE IT AND I THINK THAT ANY ONE THAT HYDROCEPHALUS COULD SEE THIS.
3,Decent arrival time but one disc was missing...,"The price was very good for this set, but unfortunately Disc 4 was missing. I believe the seller may have been unaware of this, but it is disappointing..."
3,Missing,"I was disappointed with this. Hauser has wrote a lot of very good boxing related stuff, including what is probably the definitive Muhammad Ali biography and I think the cia sponsored shenanigans that went on in Chile is an interesting and to most people unknown chapter of history so I had high hopes for this book, not that it was bad, I just expected more."
2,"Check it out from the Library, but don't buy it.","I checked this book out from the Library, and I just finished it today. I found this book hard to stick with and a couple times I just wanted to stop reading it all together. The author reapeated herself many time and kept noting that the view of Sophia was influnced by Egpytian Goddesses. But I did learn a little, so I guess it was worth my time."
5,wow!!!!,"My friends!This band is one of the biggest events that has happened recently in the metal scene.This album totally blew me away...!!!The drumming, the gutiar intros, lyrics and riffs are very powerful!If you are a lover of technical heavy metal and tired of the same US crap try this one!"
2,NOT ROAN'S BEST!!!!!,"I can't really recommend this disc even though Roan is one of my favorite DVD producers. The Milky Way with Harold Lloyd is a good print, but there is an excellent print available on The Harold Lloyd Collection. Kid Dynamite with the East Side Kids looks much better than other releases, but is full of splices and has an Astor Pictures re-issue title card. Roan really dropped the ball on this by even using a print with missing scenes. These scenes can be found on other releases. There was also a problem with the picture freezing during both films, so it might be better to just avoid this disc since these films are available elsewhere. The only items unique to this disc are the extra interview on boxing movies and the film critic intro. The interview is good, but this film critic is a waste. Both films themselves are great, but this disc just isn't."
5,This book worked for us,"In one of my daughter's pre-natal scans, she was sucking her thumb. We therefore weren't surprised when she started sucking her thumb as a baby. I was dreading getting her to stop, as I know many parents and children struggle with this. She was a serious thumb sucker, one thumb staying wrinkled most of the time because of the sucking.This book was so helpful in advising at what age to stop sucking the thumb (around 5 years old), preparing her for it, getting her motivated, getting her and I working together on the issue, and explaining how to keep her thumb out of her mouth. My daughter has now gone 2 1/2 weeks with no thumb day or night, and I don't think she'll start back up. Both my daughter and I have had a lot of fun with stopping sucking her thumb, which was the last thing I was expecting!The author's full-time job is to help children to stop sucking their thumbs or fingers. Her experience shows in the book, and all the advice she gives makes complete sense."
1,Not Much Help,The only advice that may work for my child in this book is to seek professional advice. Positive reinforcement is part of the process but not all of it. These kids do this out of habit and there is no help for that in this book. Disappointed.
2,So-so,"Feels gentle and smells nice, but hard to rinse off. Save your monry on this one and use St ives or another exfoliator."
2,Sound Quality Shortcomings,"I've had this product for 2 months and I've compared it to other dual-mode internet telephony products, specifically the Linksys CIT200 and Philips VOIP321 units. The comparison is quite stark and the VoSKY Call Center does not turn in a good performance. During a Skype call the VoSKY exhibits pronounced latency, which shows up as static and echo in the conversation. Callers on the other end of a conversation often can't make out what I'm saying, and vice versa.I like Skype and it functions well with the right equipment, but the VoSKY Call Center is not doing it for me. I've disconnected the thing and won't be using it further because of the sound quality problem."
2,Not compatible with Windows 7 & no new software available.,"If the year was 2007 and you're using Windows XP, this is a great device. But it isn't compatible with Windows 7 or newer versions of Skype, and the manufacturer support for this device (which includes driver and software updates) stopped in 2007.I also did not like that it doesn't give a standard dial tone when you pick up a phone. Instead, is plays a long message, ""welcome to vosky call center, please blah blah blah blah . . . ""; annoying. And if you are using multiple user accounts in Win7, this message plays for each logged in user account with a a one second delay in between, sounding something like, ""WelcomWelcomWelcometoVostoktoktoycalycalycaylllcencencentttt . . .""; very annoying.In short, this hardware is END OF LIFE!"
1,Disappointment,"Sorry, but voice quality through this device was far inferior to using a microphone and earphones. Those I called said I sounded like I was in a well."
2,needs updating,"I bought this product in the hope to not need a regular landline phone number. The promise of the product is to be your call center including long-distance from your cell by just punching a few numbers. However, the advanced features can only be used with a regular phone line linked in. Even Skype-In, which makes no sense at all, since it comes through the cable line not the phone line. It just doesn't ring for incoming Skype calls. Customer service was helpful. The product supports Skype to version 3.2. No committment by support on when upgrades will be available. I sent it back."
2,diappointed,"I read some great reviews on this product, but it failed to live up to them.When I use my regular line with it my downloads are stopped on the ADSL.I have to disconnect the call center when I'm not making internet calls.Their customer service has not responded to any help requests.An overpriced disappointment."
1,It only works with Skype 2.5 or older version,"This item dose not take advantage of new Skype 3.0. You need to dial 001 and area code and phone # for USA calls within USA- how dumb is that. New skype 3.0 do not need to dial 001 to make USA calls in USA. I hated male voice dial tone saying "" vosky call center ..Blah blah blah"" Thech guy at Vosky told me no option to change the dial tone nor ""001"" digit problems."
1,Injects annoying touch tones during calls. Forgets settings on reboot of PC.,"When my wife speaks during calls, the harmonics of her voice, for some reason, triggers the nearest touch tone to be auto-generated and injected into the call by some circuit in the Vosky box, causing the people we talk to to believe we are recording calls. This is very annoying and distracting! My voice does not match a touch tone and does not trigger this odd behavior. The device's software should allow the user to turn off this ""feature"".Also, when I reboot my PC, I must reset Skype's audio settings each time, to use Vosky's USB device vs. the PC's audio ports. The other USB device I've used with Skype does not have this problem, and I must assume it is another bug in Vosky's implementation."
1,"don't waste your money, because you'll soon lose your time!","If I could give this zero stars, I would. This product worked for a very short time. There is absolutely NO tech or customer support. The firmware has not been updated since May of 2007. I put it back in the box months ago because I got so tired of their only suggestions: instead of using the current version of Skype, I was told by VoSKY's tech people to use Skype version 3.2 or earlier! Every bad review you saw above this one? I have one word: Ditto! The call quality wasn't bad, but I couldn't take all of the skype restarts, and the constant vosky request to update software for which vosky has no update! In short, this product does not do what it is advertised to do!"
1,Usless,"I can hear my Skype contacts over the phone, they can barely hear me. My voice is coming through breaking up, very subtle, barely audible, in one word not intelligible for the other person. Only available for Windows is another drawback of VoSKY Call Center. Mac OS X users are a marketing reality and growing (have you heard of iPod maybe ?), don't understand how companies can go on ignoring this fact and producing ""Windows only"" products."
3,Good bra with issues,"I have to agree with most of the posts here; this is a good ""posture"" bra, but no so good for today's styles. Being a larger breasted woman, I don't look good in high neck tops, so the majority of my wardrobe is V-neck or Scoop neck. This bra really supports my posture, which is great, but not so great that I can't seem to wear it with anything I own! I'm constantly tugging and pulling on the necklines of my tops to cover the exposed bra. The V-cut on the bra is too narrow and needs to be redesigned to have a wider opening in the front. I now only wear it at home which kind of defeats the purpose to a certain extent. Would love to give it a 5-star rating, but must deduct for design issues."
4,Cups run size bigger.,I am in size 34 B. I ordered 2 of Exquisite Form Women's Front Close Cotton Posture Bra #5100531 and they were absolutely perfect for me. So I decided to get two of those too. And big surprise! Cups were bigger and around chest a little loose. Bummer....
2,Bra,Very poor support and material is not of a good quality. Would not recommend as one that can help posture.
2,Nice bra but little posture control,"I had hoped that this bra would help to relieve some upper back stiffness. It is nice fitting however the claim for ""posture correction"" is not there I will keep it as it is a true fit and I will look for the support I need in another brand."
2,Exquisite Form Bra,I have liked similar bras from this manufacturer so I purchased on that basis. However this bra does not have adjustable straps as the others I have so it is not as comfortable.
3,"Straps are not adjustable, sizes are inconsistent","I purchased this bra because it is one of the few posture bras I was able to find locally and try on. I am glad I did not purchase via internet initially because the bra sizes are inconsistent; I had to try on at least 10 before finding one that fit was suitable. The straps do not adjust, so it must fit exactly. It does help with posture but, the material is thin and I am not sure how it will handle multiple washings."
1,There's a $8 restocking fee,"Make sure you really like this item, because I was charged $8 in restocking fees. Not sure where it's mentioned in the product page; I couldn't find it anywhere."
3,bra,"the fit is really good but the fabric ic very itchy I have washed them several times but they won,t soften up."
4,good support-hard to close...,"I usually choose a front close bra because they seem to be easier to put on. This bra is reasonably priced, has good support but tough to hook-especially if you have a little extra fat around back. I will keep them however since I have no replacement yet. If you have tried on a style, then order online, if not, think twice."
3,Dissapointed,"This movie was a bit of a let down from the previews. Not nearly as suspensful, nor scary as it could have been, and the pace of it at times made me a bit drowsy at times. This involves Cusac who plays a writer who investigates haunted places. One day he recieves a postcard with a hotel name and the room 1408 on it, and his curiosity gets the best of him, and he investigates. There are a few subplots running along in this that try to build depth to this movie, and does it sufficiently, but overall the action/thrill, and unpredictability are not there to make this a lasting horror/thriller classic. Worth a viewing if you are a fan of Stephen King."
3,Preview was better than movie.,I may not be a fair judge of this movie but most of the events in this movie seemed to far fetched. I liked the Shining alot but using that movie to rate this might not be fair?
2,Neither scary nor entertaining,"Sorry, but anyone who places this film on par with The Shining is just plain uninformed. The only thing even slightly redeeming in 1408 is Cusack's performance, which is strained, I believe, to make-up for the utterly uninspired directing and flat screen write. This film is just going through the motions."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I was a bit disappointed with this movie and maybe it is because I saw Premonition first. I do not think it rates with ""The Shining"" as the cover touts although it was a good film. I don't usually purchase a film unless I intend on watching it more than once therefore I am out 20 bucks because this movie did not impress me enough to watch it again."
4,Sometimes death is better.,"This film starts off a bit slow, and could have given a bit more of a back story to make the viewer understand about the tragic loss that the main character went through. The main character has become disillusioned with life and no longer thinks that there is any mystery in life. The mind bending qualities of 1408 really creeped me out, in about the same way that ""Jacob's Ladder"" creeped me out. I think on the undercurrent all people must be horrified of the same thing, the loss of family, your mind, reality itself. There are something's that are worse than death. I think that's what 1408 was about the horror that everyone has in them that people would rather die than face. On my creep meter I give 1408 ten skulls."
5,One Of The Best Films About Ghost And Spirits,A film you can see again and again and always learn something new about the after world. The music is brilliant and John Cusack is a winner.
1,1 of 5,"The set-up is interesting enough. A paranormal investigator named Mike Enslin recieves an anonymous postcard in the mail about a particular room in New York City's Dolphin Hotel. All the card says is ""Don't Enter 1408″. So, of course, he goes to the city and books an overnight reservation.There's a satisfyingly spooky scene featuring the hotel manager. He warns the man that the room is ""evil"", begs him not to stay and talks as if he knows he's in a Stephen King story. But the plot falls apart from there, to the floor of horrid randomness, and keeps getting worse until checkout.marcellee.com"
1,Well...this could have been good.,"It was as if the writer and/or director died--changed medication--had a stroke-- in the middle of this atrocity of a ""movie""."
1,No where near as good as the short story,I first listened to this story on Audio books. I use to dirve alot and it was a great way to past the time. This was part of a group of short stories. My son was with me when I started to listen to it. I can say that this store on audio scaried my tough high school football palying son alot. But he did not want to stop listening. We both enjoyed the story alot and was glad when the story eneded. Fast forward several years and the movie shows up. I could not wait to see it and got it on DVD and it was all down hill from there.The movie was not scary or enjoyable it was boring and dumb. I have seen this happen before when you make a short story into a full length movie. There just was not enough there to make it hold my intrest. if you really want to enjoy this I say read the orginal short story or listen it on audio books
3,Please...,"give me something to write about. This movie was suppose to be scary with a story behind it. Why was the room haunted? The best line in the whole movie was ""You can check out but never leave the room! If you would like to try our express check out (a noose appears in all of the rooms)please let us know."" John Cusack's acting is his usual but the script lacked something worth acting for. Don't expect to see Samuel L. Jackson for more than five minutes!"
5,"""It's An Evil F- - - ing Room""","Do not take the early check out plan!This is a great haunted/possessed place movie.I've seen quite a few and I am a discriminatinghorror cinema fan.I loved this movie the first, second and third timesthat I watched it and I hope to watch it again.The acting, cinematography, sound, special effects,story, etc. are all excellent. I cannot think ofany negatives.Is it scary? Yes.Is it simply a vehicle for shocks? NoIt has an excellent plot and characterization,and it delivers the goods as the room experiencegoes from bad to worse to way out there.It is an expertly plotted and paced movie.Everything works to deliver precisely whatthis type of movie ought to deliver.If you are interested in an intelligent, scary,emotionally wrenching, non-exploitative (sic)horror movie, you can't go wrong with this one.Another recommendation for a scary apartment room:""Dark Water""(both the Japanese original and the American remake are excellent)Enjoy!"
5,Very scary and suspence movie !,"When I see the trailer my first word was:WOW!! excellent effect and audio I think than this movie is the best suspence movie ,GOOD !!"
4,This one surprised me!,"Mike Enslin (Cusack) thinks he's seen all the so called hauntings, spirits, and apparitions. He hadn't tried to spend a night in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. As an author of books on the subject Mike thought he'd seen it all before. He was wrong.!408 doesn't have any monsters, or blood and guts, but is a really good retelling of Steven Kings short story about the hotel room from hell. Samuel L Jackson plays the hotel manager who tries to discourage Mike from spending the night there. Although he part is small in the film Mr Jackson's character wash skillfully done, and helps make the film the jewel that it is.The story is told in the style of a twilight zone episode, only better.I really enjoyed this movie, I had read some bad reviews from the professional movie critics and if I had left it at that, I would have missed a good film.Don't forget to watch the alternate ending."
5,Unpredictable!!,Fascinating. I can watch this movie over and over. I am very picky movie fan. I hate gore and predictable movies. But I do like to be scared and this one will haunt you and keep you thinking!!
2,Different endings..,"So when i seen this movie in the theater, it blew me away. I loved it, and the ending. I decided to get it on Blu Ray since i havent seen it in a while, and when i watched it, it was great, until the ending. I loved the theatrical ending, and i was dissapointed that i paid for this and didnt get that. So just know, there is a different ending to this version! There is an alternate ending in this that is close to the theatrical one..but it isnt the same and its not in blu ray quality."
2,confusing,"Very very confusing and not scary. I love horror films, and this isn't one of them, in fact it's a rip off of The Shining."
2,Poor representation of Steven King's work,"After the famous and popular Steven King's ""The Shining""I thought this was a gross, totally too surreal, film noire not unlike Jack Nicholson played in The Shining, but ""1408"" certainly did NOT appeal to me because it was just too far removed from reality and even though I am a fan of almost any film noire genre movies. John Cusack did a great job portraying his role but the film is certainly NOT one I would ever recommend to anyone else who had never seen it. I know I'm in the minority with my opinion after checking and voting on IMDb but that's the way the cookie crumbles and I'll not apologize that I thought ""1408"" was a bad piece of trash."
5,Fantastic Experience,"I had seen this movie a while back when it first came out and totally dig the film. I wanted to expand my DVD collection and found this DVD for a great price, brand spanking new. Without hesitation, ordered it and received it a hell of a lot sooner than expected. Great seller, great product. My hats off to you. Would definitely buy again from seller. Thanks a bunch for the great experience."
4,1408,I really enjoyed watching this film and felt the storyline kept within the tile of the movie. Samuel Jackson & John Cusack held their own in acting out their respective role playing. Overall in my opinion best save for rental fee then owning.
3,It's just OK...,"And it wasn't scary so much as there were jumpy moments. John Cusack is AMAZING - you can really tell he committed to the role 100%.The storyline sort of reminded me of The Shining in a way & I was disappointed a little cause I didn't really get it (like what was the point?). All in all, we were entertained ... that is to say we laughed a lot."
3,"nice and scary horror, but still the same old formula","This film is OK: there is a mystery, strange things happen with psychological realism, but you never lose your sense that it will be over in about 1.5 hours and the guy will survive it or not. This is King's stock and trade and he does it extremely well, but after seeing the same kind of stuff for 30 years, I for one am yearning for something new, something that enters my imagination or fascinates (like, say, Polanski's Ninth Gate). This most emphatically fails on the originality score, however strong Jackson and Cusack are, for they are truly fine actors.Recommended tepidly as background noise time waster."
4,Good Enough,"This movie is good enough for me. But if you like true Horror MOVIES, this movie may disapoint you !"
1,Lame lame lame,"The editor said: ""As creepfests go, 1408 is right up there with The Shining"" DID he even watch this crapfest!?!?!? If he did he obviously didn't see Kubrick's The Shining, this movie has nothing on the Shining (which is one of the creepiest and greatest Horror films of all time). 1408 keeps trying to build up to what ends up to be nothing, trys to build tension which leads to absolutly nothing. Weak lame scares, lame effects, and over all waste of time movie, no scary at all. To try and put this lame excuse of a film in the same class as the Shining is against all the laws of good film making.1408 - sucks, waste of time and money.The Shining - amazing, rent it instead of 1408.Therein lies the difference."
2,This Movie is Shoddy at Best,"I just finished watching ""1408,"" a film I had high hopes for, not only for the good creepy trailer but for the talents of John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson there to bring Stephen King's book to life. I liked to be creeped out when watching a good horror/drama movie, and this movie never produced anything that made you eat your popcorn that more quickly. The bulk of the movie offers mild waves of the ghosts of former tenants of Room 1408 showing up to spook Mr. Cusack, and the occasional visit from his specter of a daughter who died of cancer. Is the movie a bittersweet drama of Cusack's character coming to terms with his daughter's death, or is it a spookfest trying miserably to produce some scares? It fails in both accounts.Want to be really scared while watching a movie? Buy ""Paranormal Activity"" and sit back for the ride. Now THAT is a creepy flick."
2,1408 Reasons NOT To Watch This Movie,1. Stupid2. Poorly scripted3. Ridiculous4. Over the top5. Waste of time6. Waste of my $2.50 rental fee7. etc.8. etc.................
3,"Not very scary, predictable","Stephen King's novels and stories rarely translate well to screen, for whatever reason, This one is no exception. John Cusack does okay as the jaded writer, aka Stephen King, who doesn't believe in ghosts. So, he checks into a NYC hotel room where 56 people have died horrible deaths. He proceeds to hang out the window for 20 minutes, while ghosts jump out over him. Then, the room begins to go crazy, as you would expect. There isn't a single jolt in the entire film. And we get some predictable nonsense about the lead character's dead daughter coming back to haunt him. I don't know what the budget was, but this feels like a little film. Watch it for some mild entertainment."
2,Blu Ray did not work,"This isn’t necessarily the seller’s issue, and it is certainly not a problem with amazon. In point-of-fact, both of the afore mentioned entities did their jobs quite well. The product came as described and on time; so kudos to the seller and amazon. The product itself however, did not work. It played fine through about the first hour or so, somewhere right around 1:05 the movie just jumped ahead to the very end of the movie, and every time I attempted to go back to that point (or even shortly thereafter) the movie just froze up and would not go anywhere. So in order to see if it was a disc problem, I attempted to play the movie in 2 other Blu-ray players, and as expected, the same problem arose. Amazon gave me a full refund and I returned the move so all is well that ends well I suppose. Poor Rating is strictly on the physical copy of the Blu-ray, and certainly not on the movie itself, which is a fantastic movie for the record"
5,Chapters 15 - 20 are bad,"The move is good, to bad we miss chapters 15-20.I did try this move in 4 players with the same bad 15-20 chapters"
4,Probably the one of the better Stephen Kings.....,This is surprisely decent. The ending is a much better ending than the ususal suspense films and is a great surprise in respect to the ususal Stephen King movie adaptations. Pretty good for a short story to movie flick.
4,Stongest Stephen King movie in quite a while!,"Pretty good horror flick based on a Stephen King story. More like 'The Shining' than his later, weak movies. Held together well by a really strong performance from John Cusack as the writer who is trapped in a really evil hotel room. Not usually my kind of movie, and yet I still liked it."
2,A Mile Wide; An Inch Deep,"I wanted so badly to enjoy this film. I kept hoping that somehow it would 'pick up' and get on its feet. Unfortunately it never did, and in fact just kind of gave way to a bizarre nothingness somewhere in the middle. Basically this is about a cynical paranormal writer staying in a hotel room where all kinds of bad things happened over the years. And really? That's about it.Yet, there was so much to work with in the story. It could have been deeper, the plot more involved. The characters could have been so much more than they were. This film is a hodge-podge of mostly nebulous loose ends that never get tied up. It moves at a snails pace and you wait for something that just never happens. The ending is unbelievable and contrived. However, the special effects are very good."
3,1408 - Review,"No one can explain the strange goings-on in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel. In this thriller based on a Stephen King story, writer and paranormal debunker Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is determined to demystify the ghostly events, even though a hotel clerk (Samuel L. Jackson) begs him to rethink his plans. Mike needs to write another book soon, and room 1408 may be his ticket to the top of the best-seller list. But will he survive even one night?"
2,Love Stephen King Hate His Movies!,How can a writer be one of my favorites makes or choose the people to make such bad movies? Paid to go see this and regret it. Save your money. See it when it makes it onto regular TV..... Sorry Stephen but please keep writing!
2,The short story was much better,"This movie had alot of potential - great story and excellent cast - but it didn't work well for me. There are very few King books that translate well on the big screen (with a few notable exceptions) and this one just didn't work for me. The movie really had little to do with King's story, aside from the fact that the protagonist is a writer doing a story about a 'haunted' hotel room. Perhaps I would have liked this movie more if I had not already read the story. In any event, this isn't an awful movie, it just didn't live up to my expectations."
4,Kids.... Don't do drugs!,"This movie is what an acid trip gone horribly, horribly wrong would be like. It is just a psychological madhouse from start to finish. I am not really feeling the negative reviews here. I thought this was a very powerful, ultra trippy movie that really puts the watcher in a terrible place. The acid trip gone wrong really says it all here. The feeling of dread when you can't tell fantasy from reality is emphasized in such a compeling way all throughout this movie. Just when you think you're out, the nightmare continues, and you are whisked away into your hellish dreams all over again, trapped in a single, claustrophobic hotel room. If you are a fan of tripped out psych-horrors, this one will definately blow you away."
5,Scary,"If you wish to be scared, buy this movie! My hubby & I are not easily scared, but this movie did ""IT"" for us!!"
2,Old School Horror,"I thought this was an ok movie. It is a classic ghost story/horror movie done with todays special effects. I thought it was pretty good but I must say, this is not my genre and I have never been a real fan of this type of movie or any horror movie for that matter. My friends really enjoyed it and if you like classic horror, ghost stories or scares of that nature you probably will find it to be a good one. I thought it was good but nothing I haven't seen from the old Hammer days with Vincent Price, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Boris Karloff."
1,Catalogue of horror special effects,"Our protagonist goes in an hotel that has an haunted room (1408, at least it wasn't 666). At first the only horrific thing he notices is the hideous wallpaper. Then all usual ingredients show up.Let's see...electric appliances going on of their own, check!Unsettling music, check! Scary ghosts, Check! Eerie unhearthly lights, check! Homicidal madman with ax, check! Walls spilling blood, check! Dead children appearing, check! Ghastly pictures on walls running wild, check! Zombies, check!Desperate fugue in labyrinth, check!But... wait a moment! Didn't we see it all in Kubrick's Shining?That's right. We saw it, and it was a masterpiece, contrary to this confused and confusing drivel."
3,"Looks cool, but has no point","Very cool special effects and production design here, and John Cusack does his best. However, it can be hard to translate King's work to the screen and this is an example of that problem. Samuel Jackson is fine, but his role really could have been played by anyone. I really couldn't see the point of the whole thing either. The weak ending certainly does not help. I'd wait until cheapo day at your local video rental place before getting this one."
1,Absolutely horrible,"John Cusack was great in this film, too bad the writing, directing, production design, special effects, and music score were all boring, unoriginal, and uninspired. What a stinker of a movie. It felt like a Disney version of a haunted house film. Don't get me wrong, the lack of gore was not the problem here. The problem was everything else that WAS on screen except Cusack. There is a quote on the DVD box from the reviewer at Maxim saying this film ranks with ""The Shining"". He must've seen the 90's remake. This movie is not even close to anything achieved in Kubrick's ""The Shining"". Samuel Jackson was only in this movie for literally one scene, and it wasn't that great. If you want to see a Stephen King film adaptation about a writer trapped in a building, that's actually entertaining, watch ""Misery"" or ""The Shining"" and you'll be much happier."
2,Stephen King films still cursed,"The first 30 minutes of this film set a good dark creepy atmosphere, then just turned silly.The attempts at Scary simply were overdone to the point of becoming comical.My wife was laughing.Cusak's acting was good considering what he had to work with.Stephen King is one of the top horror writers of our generation and deservedly so, but he seems to have his own curse.......... meaning almost every attempt to translate his stories to the big screen fail.The premise of the film was good but it seems they tried too hard to use special effects and eye candy to create terror and thus it lost it's edge and became ho-hum."
2,not a fan,"it wasn't scary or thrilling. my question is what was the point of this movie??? samuel jackson didn't have a huge part in it, so why is he on the cover. it was all john cusack. it was confusing and very boring to me. you already know what happened in the room from the beginning, so why have a movie based on the things that went on in the room???"
1,I've seen better,"Got this through an old Pepsi Promotion for free and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. The basic idea was okay, but in the end, if you want a good class horror movie that takes place in a hotel, go for The Shining original, not the tv remake)."
2,1408,"This movie was a big let down. It should not have been listed as a horror movie, it was a psychological thriller and kinda of drawn out at that. I thought the acting was good for what there was to work with. Watch it once but don't waste your money."
2,BLAH,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS MOVIE STRAIGHT UP SUCKED. IT DIDNT ""EXPLAIN"" THE PLOT IN THE BEGINNING BUT IN THE MIDDLE INSTEAD. SOME PARTS WERE THRILLING BUT AS FOR THE REST WELL...IVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER TO SEE THIS MOVIE AND AM SHOCKED AT THE FACT ITS A LOW BUDGET MOVIE. OH WELL HAPPENS I GUESS. ON THE OTHER HAND MY SISTER IS 14 AND HER AND HER FRIENDS LOVED IT. SO MAYBE A TEEN AUDIENCE IS BETTER FOR THIS MOVIE."
3,Decent Effort but Not Great,1408 had it's creepy moments but overall could have been way scarier. The concept behind it was great. The story is based on the travels of a skeptical writer(John Cusack) in his search for an actual haunted hotel. He has written many books and searched for hauntings world wide to only come up empty until he reached room 1408. Once in room 1408 he undergoes many physcological thrills that may turn out to be a reality.I would say definately rent this one but don't expect too many scares. It is more of a mind thriller then an actual horror film.
4,Nice horror film w/o gore,"a ""psychological "" horror film with little gore but nonetheless scary and spookyand riveting. my favorite for Holloween. Most people should enjoy this."
4,Good for what it is,"So this is exactly what you think... A laminated placemat. It is sturdy, not a thin lamination, but dont be fooled to think this is going to be heavy duty. I would not trust it in the dishwasher. That being said, it is helping with my son leaning his alphabet, and is standing up through many meals."
3,Less than impressed...,"This placemat needs to be updated. It looks like it was printed decades ago. I like what it has on it, but the graphics and coloring are very outdated in appearance. We have had people comment on it, stating we must have gotten it ages ago, and when I tell them I just purchased it from Amazon they are stunned."
4,childrens literature,I love this book. I'm taking a class and this is the book we're using. It's great for someone who's not familiar with children's literature. so if you have kids then you should read it.
2,Sorry,"The only reason I got this book is because it was the text book for one of my classes. I did not like it, I didn't like the way the information was presented, nor did I like the content."
5,perfect for school!,"I purchased this book for my Children's Literature class rather than purchasing the third edition that the professor told us to get. There is no difference between the editions except for the cover, and sometimes things are a page off, for example, my professor asked us to turn to page 202 to look at a list, and mine was on page 203 instead. I saved a ton of money getting this edition and it worked perfectly for my class. The book I received was in perfect condition too. Glad I went with this one!"
2,Flawed design,"The case protects your iPod Nano (Gen 2) against scratches and other direct assaults but when the small molded-in retaining tangs on either end crack and break away, which they will, the iPod is free to fall out when held vertically, which mine did and damaged both ends when it fell unimpeded to the ground. Do not buy this cover!"
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I purchased this great double cd in 1986 as a French import and have never tired of listning to it! Disc one containes my favorite - ""The Dream Is Always the Same"" and ""Ricochet Part Two"". Disc two gets even better with ""Force Majeure"", ""Love on a Real Train"" (from the movie RISKY BUSINESS)and the incredable ""Logos Part One (A&B)"" and ""Logos Part Two"" ( from the movie THE KEEP)! This double CD will make your system sound GREAT, or perhaps indicate what new equipment you might need! Buy and enjoy!"
3,fun to play,"The game is ok, just will not run on Vista or Windows 7 64 bit. We have to use old PC to play with lesser graphics."
