3,you do get what you pay for,"Based on all the rave reviews on Amazon I purchased a Celestron 52250. I already have a Bushnell and was looking to step up. The Celestron at 20X has good image quality but once you go to the higher magnifications the image deteriorates dramatically. My advice, if you want a good scope, is spend a little more and get a Kowa."
5,Great For Spotting,I got this for my husband for Christmas and it was a big hit. He was jealous that his friend had this really expensive spotter when they were hunting for Mountain Sheep. I got him this one and he says it is just as good or better.
5,"Great scope, excellent price","The Celestron 52250 is my entry-level scope - I have no other scopes to compare it to - but I am very happy with its performance. It is built solidly, is easy to use, and provides images that meet and exceed all my expectations - and the price can't be beat."
1,Junk,"I bought this scope for long range shooting and although I didn't expect it to work at 600-1000 yards, I would at least have expected to be able to see a 30 cal. bullet hole in a white target at 300 yards, but the resolution at high power is absolutely atrocious. It might be great for birdwatching or spying on your neighbors, but otherwise it is junk."
4,Celestron Ultima 80mm Spotting Scope,"For the price, this is a great spotting scope. It is lightweight and its construction is rugged enough to handle my birding adventures through the brush. The focus and zoom are very simple, user-friendly, and easy to do in the field. Color and clarity are great at 20x but do seem to reduce as you work up to 60x."
4,Good value,"Overall, I'm very happy with this scope. I primarily use it for bird watching in my yard.The image is sharp at 20X, however becomes a little blurry while zooming to 60X, but still not bad for the price.Overall, decent optics, waterproof, lifetime warranty, a good value for the price."
1,Not as shown,"I bought the Charger Hard Hat. Looks geat in the pic! It came as white, not blue, and the bolt is orange, not gold. Very bad. Amazon told me to go to a page that doesn't seem to exist to fix this problem. Not a happy customer!"
1,Don't believe the Hype,There is so much hype about this product that I had to buy on for son. Ended up using a large zip lock bag after he passed the new born size diapers. Please save your $15.00. Your baby doesn't care where his diapers are kept.
5,Works great!,I got this for my brother who has a Dell Inspiron 1000 that does not have wifi. It was cheap and seemed like a great choice instead of the USB wifi sticks that are more flimsy and prone to damage due to sticking out. It was a great choice. My brother installed it and it installed quickly and works great. He now uses the internet on it all the time which is awesome. Definitely would recommend this device to anyone with an old laptop that does not have wifi.
1,Wont work at all,"Didn't work at all, even after Belkin web site recommendations. Belkin did not respond to my email. No refund, stuck with junk. I tried to install numerous times on my Compaq Evo N610c."
1,Beware if you're using a Mac,"For this Belkin Notebook card (F5D7010 version 8) there aren't any drivers for Mac OS included and neither is is possible to download them anywhere. They just don't exist. If you are using a Mac, version 3 of this card is the only possible solution. But I don't know whether this version is still sold."
1,Doesn't work with Ubuntu 6.06,"Wouldn't connect with Linux, post office lost the package I returned to Amazon, so I am out over $30 so far with nothing to show for it. A much less expensive D-Link worked fine with Ubuntu 6.06."
5,Works well with dodgy XP installs,"I bought a wireless adapter for $20 from some manufacturer that I hadn't ever heard of and don't remember. It had some clash with my XP install, and kept blue-screening. I gave up on it and their crappy tech support, and shelled out for the Belkin. It was worth the extra price."
1,BIG TIME DRIVER ISSUE,"Like others I'm having problems with the drivers. One moment it will show the wireless networks tab under the card properties, the next minute after a reboot it won't. This is a real pain when it loses its network settings every time I reboot. I have to reconfigure WEP and the ssid each time since I have a hidden ssid. This card is a pain and there are too many other options out there to put up with this."
5,Just Keeps on Working,"I've used it now for over 4 years, and it is fine. It was dormant for 2 years, but there was no glitch when I recently fired it up again,."
1,I didn't buy this item,I didn't buy this item I didn't buy this item I didn't buy this item I didn't buy this item I didn't buy this item I didn't buy this item. I didn't buy this item. i
1,Linux Users Beware,"I purchased this card after borrowing a card with an identical product number from a friend. My friend's card worked out of the box with my version of Ubuntu Linux.When I received my card, it simply did not work. After doing some research, I found that I had a card with a different version number, and a different chipset. My friend's card had a chipset made by Atheros, which worked out of the box. The card that I purchased had a Broadcom chipset, which is notorious for being incompatible with Linux. Even after going to the forums, I was unable to make the card work.Belkin is dishonest, in that it makes changes to the chipset without changing the product number, only the version number, which the consumer is not made aware of. Had I been aware that the card had a different chipset, I would not have ordered it."
1,Belkin's downloadable drivers do not function!,I am writing this here for anyone having trouble installing this card using Belkin's drivers from their support website.Simply they are not the right drivers & will not work!For a working driver for Win9x/2K/XP copy the following into the address bar: http://www.ralinktech.com/drivers/Windows/IS_STA_2500_D-3.0.3.0_U-2.3.6.0_042505_1.0.2.0.exeThis driver is from the actual chipmaker and works fine :-)Ralink's name for the product is 11g-RT2500 and downloads for other OS's including Mac can be found here: http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htmI hope this helps to shortcut somebody's efforts to get this card working...
2,Incompatible with Mac OS X - Error on Belkin's Website,"I bought Ver. 5000 of this card to use with my Pismo PowerBook running Mac OS X 10.3.9. Despite the claims on Belkin's website, this card is incompatible with Macs. Belkin does not even provide Mac drivers for this 'Mac-Compatible' card !!! A quick call to Tech Support confirmed this.Older versions of this card (ver. 2000 and 3000) used the Broadcom chipset and are Mac compatible. Newer versions use the Atheros (?) chipset, which does not work in Macs.I returned this card and bought the F5D7011 Ver. 1101, which runs natively in Mac OS X 10.3.9 and Mac OS X 10.4."
4,Very good,I upgraded to g from my built in adapter in my thinkpad. At first I got a netgear USB adapter which had horrible reception. This one has good and stable reception. The range still is not any better than my built in Intel 802.b adapter but the speed certainly is. Its only getting 4 stars because it sucks the life out of my battery (netgear had the same issue which is related to loss of energy in the form of heat- its HOT).
5,"very good reception, but it has driver issue","after couple days of use, I have to re-write the reviewthis card has very good receptionhowever, it shows only when not under heavy loadthe reception drops dramatically when under load (file transfer, streaming radio)after talking w/belkin ts, they suggest the driver from web, unfortunately, I am using with THIS driver, not the one with CD (I lost it the way back home after purchasing)I'll give it back 5 stars once I found the solution of this issue (it happens on both laptop, even with any configuration)"
1,Crap,"tried for two and a half hours to install. Tried installing from the disc, tried downloading drivers from the company that makes the chipset, tried drivers from Belkin's website. NOTHING WORKED. Avoid this piece of crap and save headaches and time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Almost Perfect,"This is a great storage cabinet for all of our cds, dvds, and vhs tapes. It is attractive and holds everything we wanted. And for looks and storage it is a perfect 5. However, it comes in pieces and must be assembled. Now, I enjoy assembling furniture, but this took me two nights and I did screw up once or twice. The instructions are not the best, and can be frustrating if you are tired and don't keep your head. I suggest putting it together on a weekend, when you have the 4+ hours it may take you to put it together."
2,Vinyl info for dinosaur rock lovers only,"I didn't know that vinyl collecting was restricted to late 60's and 70's rock acts. I was mistakenly under the impression that there would be info on Jazz, Blues, Reggae, New Wave, Punk and maybe even Country artists. Nothing of interest to me so far after 5 or 6 issues. Really a one sided interest in the editorial decisions."
3,"Good, but...","Goldmine is an okay mag for vinyl collectors but unless your only cares are centered around Elvis and the Beatles then you may be disappointed. I understand those two acts bring more at auctions than anything else but who would watch sports if the only teams you ever heard about were the Yankees, Cowboys, and Lakers? I'm sure there are people out there who will have blood shoot from their eyes after reading my review but my stance is undisputed. Just count the covers."
2,"works well, but too little product","it works wonderfully, but i started waxing at home to save money. i only had enough wax for 2 bikini waxes, so the price was basically the same as in a salon. (about $25 each time)"
4,Does what you need,"The product is good for what you need and does what it says. However, the wax on your skin becomes brittle quickly and therefore you have to do small areas at a time. It doesn't make the product bad, just not perfect. I would still recommend it, but I would also keep looking."
4,Fabulous!,"This is the easiest at-home waxing kit I've exer used, hands down. Everything about the process was easy. Exactly as advertised. So glad I bought this!"
2,Bob Dylan's Anthology,I never ordered this item I ordered Bryan Adams anthology but you guys sent me bothLately when I order stuff your site increases quantities or places items that I haven't selected in my cart.It sucks that this happens. I found someone who plays an instrument and gave them the book. I never would have purchased this book! They really didn't care for it as they already have enough bob Dylan music. Since I'm not a musician I have no idea if the book is good or not. But I did enjoy the letter left behind by the original owner.
1,Unbelievably bad,"This music does not bear the slightest resemblance to Gregorian chant. Just some dumb muzak redubs, by a bunch of guys."
1,Gregorian POS,"If I had to guess that this awful music was going to go Gregorian Chant style, I would have slashed my wrists already. When people want to ban music for being subversive, offensive, etc...they should look to albums like this as they are crimes against humanity. Worst POS ever. I would like to give a shout out to all the FBGs. LOOK AT ME, I WROTE A REVIEW FOR A POS ALBUM."
2,The little monk who traveled through time...,"Sorry to be the naysayer, unless time travel does indeed exist, Dion and Pope Gregory the Great had missed their chance to collaborate by about 1500 years. Although this concept is interesting, and the realization of it is at least mediocre, the premise is bogus! Sorry folks, Celine Dion never sang any plainchant! This album would be better described as ""Men's-Chorus with-lots-of-reverb's tribute to Celine Dion."" This project would be better placed in a Men's Glee Club concert."
5,Amr Diab is the best,"I just love his music. ""Nour El Ain"" is one of the songs played in ""El Clon"" telenovela. You do not need to understand the words to the songs....just listen and DANCE."
1,"Nice watch, as long as it worked","I liked this watch when I first received it. But it stopped working after a few weeks. It might just have been the battery. But a new watch costing several hundred dollars should not have problems in only a few weeks, so I returned it. Bummer."
2,Banana Bread and Pecan Pie,"If all I wanted was a date flavored bar I'd have bought a date bar. As a date bar they're ok, just relabel them as such."
2,box was open and expiration date was only 5 months out,"I will never order again. The box was open, so I don't know whether this was a returned item or really what happened to it. The expiration date is only 5 months out which is not what I expected."
1,disgusting product,"I went hiking for two weeks and every morning we were provided with larabars in our breakfast bag. At first it seemed no that bad, but then we got the cinnamon roll flavor and I could not even get halfway through, it is just plain disgusting."
1,not as good as claimed,"As someone on a low sodium diet I have to make many types of food which most people buy, such as applesauce,bread, ricotta,and granola. I think these bars-and other Larabar flavors- taste 'chemical' to the point that they verge on artificial, despite being haled as all natural. ""Natural"" does not equal tasty,and it often means nothing important. Besides tasting better,I wish the sodium levels were more readable - and lower.Sure fat,sugar and protein are all important,but more people die of cardiac disease and hypertension -linked to high sodium in the diet- than from lack of protein."
1,Oh it was AWFUL!,"Having read the other reviews, I wonder if mine had just gone bad. It has almost a fermented alcohol-like smell.My husband got the cashew bar, I got the banana cookie.Both were were so nasty we threw them away without eating them."
2,"hands down, the worst tasting fitness bar i've ever tried.","If I wanted unprocessed unsweetened cherries, dates, and almonds, I would eat them all individually, not mashed up and packaged up in a bar. These taste terrible. 2 stars for being healthy, but tasting awful."
1,Just Say NO,"These are not worth the money and are not that healthy. When unprocessed cashews or pecans are compared to the fat, calorie and protien content in Lara Bars a person would be better off eating the nuts mixed with no sugar added dried fruit. Also, the texture leaves something to be desired."
1,OMG - The horrors....the horrors.,"Everyone in my family shares my opinion that these things taste absolutely HORRIBLE. I feel really bad for someone who needs to eat Gluten/Dairy/Soy-free or Vegan/Kosher foods. If I had to live on these alone (and I don't), I'd convert back to being a non-vegan or whatever. We all tried the Cherry Pie flavor, and what this thing has to do with cherry pies is way beyond me. It's a lump of semi-solid goop with some nuts and dried fruits that taste sour and bitter and somewhat sticky. Simply gross to the point I couldn't even finish one bar. I may not be a health food nut, but I know what tastes like crap when I taste it...and these things are crap all the way. Steer clear. Even 1/2 hour after, I still have that horrible taste in my mouth and need to go brush my teeth to get rid of it."
5,A great product paired with a great shopping experience.,A great product paired with a great shopping experience. I use these while biking and I like it more than liquid products.
3,they're ok,"I found these to be a little on the dry and crumbly side, which made them less appealing than other flavors of Larabars. However, they do taste exactly like PBJ, just a consistency issue for me."
3,Maybe I've been spoiled by artificial flavors and ingredients,"Needed something to munch on at work, so I jumped on this when Amazon offered a coupon. I'd heard good things about Larabars. I find it kind of... ~meh~ Maybe it's an acquired taste."
5,Great after workout snack!,"I have these shipped to me every month, as they are the best tasting Larabar I've had! I always carry around 1 or 2 with me for a quick boost, and with 6 grams of protein, they are a great energy booster."
2,Tasty but.....,Larabars are one of the several natural companies that are fighting labeling GMO's. Don't buy them!!It is important for us to know what is in our food.
5,Teenage daughter loves the Cherry Pie,I have to buy a case of these for my daughter - she is 17. She loves the Cherry Pie and the Apple Pie. Do I need say more?
1,Moldy Bars,"Looking at the reviews I see that I'm not the only one who got a box of moldy bars. The flavor I ordered was Key Lime Pie. I like Lara bars, but haven't ordered them in a while. What a disapointment to get a box of mold. They didn't expire until 2013, so I don't know what caused it. I'm realizing now I should have contacted Amazon, but I just got side tracked. I'm debating whether I should chance it again. I used to order these all the time without a problem, so I'm not sure what's changed."
4,One of the better snack bars you'll find,"I've now sampled four different varieties of LaraBar, and here's my main take on the lemon ones: if you like lemon squares, this is your bar. The all-natural raw foods approach makes for a great snack bar - not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner - but the lemon flavor here is definitely not subtle. I still enjoyed the box, but prefer the cherry pie or banana cookie flavors."
5,larabar ginger snap,"This bar is utterly delicious. Real ginger makes it spicy and crunchy and everything else makes it sweet, and the whole shebang is just so good for you. They vanquish hunger for hours and give you lots of energy. I am pretty sure I could live off of these."
2,"Love Lara Bars, Just not this Flavor","The Cherry Pie flavor is, for me, far too tart. I really prefer the pecan Pie bar out of all the ""Pie"" flavors."
5,Best Bars I've Found,"I've tried many bars over the years, from snack bars to energy bars. These bars are the best tasting and are great in any flavor, but my favorite flavor is Peanut Butter Cookie as it's not too sweet. Being gluten sensitive and struggling with low blood sugar, Lara Bars are the perfect balanced snack for me when on the go whether I'm running errands or exercising. I ride a bicycle for many miles and carry a couple of Lara Bars, some fruit, and water. As a result, I feel sufficiently fueled for my rides and do not encounter any stomach distress."
3,Ok Bar,"Unlike the Cherry Pie which is great and really taste like cherry pie, this is more of a lime flavored almond bar. Not bad, but not great."
4,"Good, but too many nutshells in my bar.","I love Larabars and I love pistachios. Unfortunately I have found too many nutshells in my pistachio larabars. The shells I find are small, but it is bothersome to me to be chewing on something and suddenly hit something sharp and hard. I don't think I'll be buying these again, despite their good taste."
4,Lemon larabar,"First off while opening the package you get a good lemon sent. Bar semi firm and pretty moist from the dates. Great lemon flavor, reminiscent of a lemon merengue pie. Bit of crunch from the almonds and cashews. Overall a great bar. Gluten, dairy, and soy free (there are only five ingredients: dates, cashews, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, and natural lemon flavor) non gmo, vegan, and kosher. Package is very well labeled with these notes.It lacks any value in the form of vitamins. But has a decent amount of fiber. Higher in fat (11g) than most other bars I've tried.I would recommend these to take along with for some snacking purposes mostly as a candy bar reacement. Not really nutritious enough for an emergency meal replacement."
5,Yummy bars,"I have tried Larabar gluten free bars previously. I tried a variety pack that I purchased locally, and enjoyed them very much. When I saw these on Amazon, the price was great. Upon tasting them, I found they lived up to the Larabar quality I have experienced in the past. Both flavors of chocolate and coconut came through very nicely. I would definitely purchase Larabar bars in the future."
3,"Good lemon flavor,no potassium punch.Back to the lab.","The creators of this flavor (in the excellent larabar line of energy bars) got the lemon flavor perfect;but why did they leave out the potassium common in most other selections?The potassium is what makes the good ""well being"" feeling after you have digested this wonderful fiber heavy food and without that you get a curious hollow feeling when you are supposed to be humming.That is Humm Foods goal, after all.I wonder what lara was thinking about with this one flavor?I would suggest a re-working of the lemon selection to incorporate more minerals.( especially the potassium).Otherwise, these are great bars; the cherry pie and cinnemon roll are the best ,followed by banana cookie,pecan pie,and apple pie of the flavors I have tried.But as everyone knows, most no other opinion is more subjective than taste."
3,Love Larabar!,"This isn't my favorite flavor, but still pretty good. Larabar is an awesome product. Minimal ingredients and raw. We keep them stocked."
5,"Brief review - Taste great, no itch!","These taste graet for a health bar. Of course, you'll miss all the tasty high fructose corn syrup and sugar, but it's palatable enough. The main reason I like these bars is that I don't get the allergic itch I get with some other health bars. If you have any food or nut allergies, you know what I'm referring to. So far so good!"
1,Moldy! Full of a white fuzzy mold!,"Every one of the bars have a white fuzzy mold on them. It is disgusting!Fortunately, I received a refund; without having to go through the hassle of having to package them up and send them back."
4,"Great bar, but don't expect fruit in every bite!","We really like Lara Bars. We originally purchased our first ones at Whole Foods, mainly because the ingredients list is very pure and simple.When you eat these bars, don't think fruit first, think nuts then fruit. Then when you hit the chunk or bit of fruit its a nice suprise. Don't get us wrong, these are great... but there is a marketing difference in ""Banana Cookie"" vs. ""Banana Nut Bread"" for instance.Definately worth picking up, especially at Amazon prices/shipping."
1,"These are very small, bite sized bars. The price is way too high","Watch out for this one. There are 12 bars, but they are bite sized. The price is way too high."
3,not too crazy about the flavor....,"not as good as i expected from the ratings on here. they are not sweet at all & kind of too tart but has over 20 grams of sugar in 1 bar??? but they are made with raw, healthy ingredients so i will eat them. maybe i'll try another flavor next time."
2,Tastes like ick,"I'm not a fan. If you like dense and dry, like a pack of desicated Fig Newtons compressed into a single bar, then Larabars may be for you, but they're not for me."
2,yuk,You better like the taste of dates as that's all you taste with these bars. No way this should be called apple pie.
1,Pecan Pie = horrible!,"Horrendous texture and even worse taste! Bar was waxy, dense and bland tasting with NO semblence of pecan pie flavor whatsoever. My expectations were reasonable considering that this is a nutritional product rather than an actual slice of pecan pie, but it was so awful I had to throw it away after 2 bites, followed by a thorough rinse-and-spit session with a glass of cold water. Blah! Sorry Larabar, I tried to like you..."
5,So glad I finally tried these,"I have been wanting to try Larabars for over a year. Finally today I picked up a box at Sam's club (the only place even remotely close to me that carries them), and I couldn't be more pleased. The bar I tried today was Apple Pie. The ingredients in the Apple Pie bar are dates, almonds, apples, walnuts, raisins and cinnamon. That's it. All natural, real food. I will say that it does not look enticing, or actually even at all appealing, and the texture leaves something to be desired...but it tastes wonderfully natural and gives a nice energy boost. It will be perfect for before/after/during workouts, but has enough calories that if I am too busy to eat a meal it will suffice. Does it taste like apple pie? Only slightly. But people who aren't accustomed to eating apple pie really won't mind, or may not even notice."
4,Tastes OK,"Tastes OK has a very strong lemon flavor, I understand its a Lemon bar but I feel its a bit too overwhelming."
1,Mold on my Bars,"I received these bars a few weeks ago, they have an expiration date of Mar 09, 2013 but there is a lot of mold on them. Please look at them closely before eating them."
1,Product was moldy,"I purchased these through Warehouse Deals, and even though they still had not reached the ""sell by"" date...the bars were covered in fuzzy white mold. Ick. I have bought many food items on Amazon and never had a problem with mold. I have bought many Larabars individually and in the 5 pack boxes and never had mold."
3,pecan pie?,"I will keep this ""review"" simple. Yes, this is a quality product but...Basically this is a date bar flavored with a few nuts. If you like dates and nuts, you will like the pecan pie Larabar. If you think you are going to pretend you are enjoying pecan pie while eating healthy...I hope you have a good imagination. It tastes EXACTLY like dates and nuts because it IS dates and nuts. It's great if you like DATES and NUTS.Don't be romanced by Illusions...and if you find that you are, remember..I TOLD YOU SO! Dates and nuts, dates and nuts, dates and nuts."
2,"Love the product, but obviously has sat on shelves for long time","Love this product, however the bars where hard and dried out. Didn't really realize until I purchased a single bar at the grocery store, which was moist and chewy. This large count box has clearly sat around in the warehouse for a while...."
2,Disappointed,"i picked those bars, because they're my favorite larabars. When package arrived, I noticed, that even though there's still 2 months till expiration date, my bars are stale and don't taste as the one I was usually getting at my grocery store."
2,"Disappointing, but to each his own.","I heard nothing but raves about this bar and how it tastes ""just like cherry pie!"".Ummm, perhaps people need to eat more cherry pie, because the cherry pie I'm used to tastes nothing like these... These tastes a lot more like someone doused a date and nut bar with sour cherry juice.Too tart and WAY too sweet."
5,Best bar ever!,"The cashew cookie bar is one of the best bars i have ever eaten, especially when you look at the ingredients. It is all natural with no preservatives. you cannot make a better tasting, better for you bar. I eat these on my long runs on the weekends and they seem to sustain my energy very well. The flavors i have liked the best, of the ones i have tired, are cashew cookie, cinnamon roll, apple pie, and gingersnap."
5,Fantastic!,"Best Energy bar ever...healthy, tasty, & less than 4 ingredients. What could be better than that. Great taste too."
3,Not my favorite,"These are very filling and I suppose they're good for you. They're just to ""heavy"" for my taste. But I eat them anyway. =}"
3,Larabar purchase,"I was glad to find Larabars for sale on Amazon, however, I later found them for sale at a much better price at Trader Joe's and Jewel Food store.I won't be purchasing them from Amazon in the futureThey were delivered promptly and were very fresh so that was good.Thanks much."
1,"High calorie, high fat, low taste","Beware, these small bars have nearly as many calories and fat as a candy bar.Taste of the chocolate coconut chew variety is best described as bittersweet cocoa mixed with lard."
1,Puzzle....,How many calories? How much fat/trans fat? How much protein? Full ingredients should be listed - they sound great but nutritional info should be supplied.Too much of a puzzle to order without knowing....Petunia
5,Dawn Renee Spencer,"Fabulous. If your interest is QUALITY unprocessed food, and not QUANTITY for your pennies, you'll agree. LARABAR are sweetened with nothing but natural unprocessed dates, which are pricy. The mini variety pack gives you a taste of a few flavors so you can choose which flavors to invest in later on."
5,"Super tasty, pronounceable ingredients","I was on the lookout for granola bars that have ingredients that are more natural. I used to love Nature Valley bars, then I fell in love with the FiberOne bars, then I inhaled Balance bars. Now I think I've settled on Larabars, simply because they have such few ingredients and I can pronounce every single one of them. Even better, I can go to a regular grocery store and buy the ingredients, and if I'd want to spend more time in the kitchen, I could make them myself! (google for recipes, people really do make them themselves!)Love that Amazon sells them in bulk (they can get quite pricey, depending on which grocery store you go to).My favorite flavers are the Coconut Creme Pie, the Keylime Pie, the Carrot Cake, and the Cherry Pie. Soooo good! I don't leave the house without one or two of these in my bag :)"
5,Great,"I love larabars but hate spending a lot for them, so this is a great way to get a box of one of my favorite flavors at a great price."
4,Fermented but still good,"All of mine (cashew cookie) had a subtle wine taste/smell of fermented fruit, but I ate them all anyway. Nowhere near expiration date, not moldy or anything. I ordered a box of a different flavor to see if they have the wine taste as well. Overall I do like the product and the price is very reasonable.Update: The Banana Bread flavor, as someone else had mentioned, has an unusually bitter taste despite having dates as the second ingredient."
4,Delicious,Great as an on-the-go snack. The bars are small and fit right in my purse. The apple flavor is delicious!
3,Love Larabars but,The two packages I got were a little on the stale side of things. This is by far my favorite larabar. I'll buy them online using the subscribe and save when it is cheaper than I can get them in the grocery store but I have to be diligent in checking the price each month because the price can fluctuate greatly on amazon. A little stale + expensive = I'm not buying them. A little stale + cheaper than the grocery store = a good deal in my book.
3,Just Okay....,I had such high expectations and these disappointed me. There are so many great tasting bars out there and these just did not do it for me. I'll stick with the Clif bars for sure. Less expensive and definitely better tasting.
2,Very strong taste,"Although I love larabars, this was a bit too strong of a ginger taste for me. Good quality, good texture but just too much ginger for me."
5,Simple Ingredients Make for a Great Food Bar,"Lara's simplicity is it's greatest asset. Delicious cashew and dates taste. I've gotten into the habit of keeping a few in my car's glovebox. While I have not tasted many of the other Lara Bar flavors, this one is superb."
4,Gluten Free Natural Snack Bars...,Gluten freeDairy freeNon-GMO...that's just a few of the things that make these fruit and nut snack bars healthy and delicious!
3,I love them BUT,The wallnuts and pecans used in the Larabars are often a bit rancid.I also wish the Ginger Snap had more ginger in it.
3,"Good, but not Pecan Pie",I expected these to taste like pecan pie. They taste more like date nut bars.
1,Banana Bread?,I bought one single banana bread bar to taste before ordering. It was absolutely disgusting- bitter without a hint of banana. I couldn't even swallow a small bite. Very disappointing.
3,larabar pbandj,I ordered this product online due to high reviews but the taste of the product was not at all what I thought. It is very dense and low on taste.
3,Meh.,"These aren't horrible, but as a Celiac, I was really excited at the reviews that said these bars really tasted like cinnamon rolls. They don't. I think the cinnamon flavor is a little strong, but otherwise they taste like dates & nuts. That's great, if that's what you're going for. I'm a bigger fan of the lemon flavor ones. They have a good strong lemon flavor without being too sweet."
5,Best Bar Out There!!,"If you have allergies to gluten, dairy, soy this is the bar for you. Also, I eat Paleo... ish diet. The is literally nothing in this but fruit, nuts and spices. I've done a Whole 30 diet while traveling and this helps to have in the car for emergency snack. Best flavor: Carrot Cake, Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, and Coconut Cream. Enjoy! I eneded up saving about $5 with coupon instead of buying at Whole Foods."
5,yummy,Carrot cake flavor Larabar snack bars are delicious! They are a great snack for the afternoon and good for you too!
5,One of my favorite bars,"Their banana bread bar is definitely one of the tastier bars in the market for those who like the taste of bananas... The texture is perfect for a soft juicy biteAs for the nutrition, the ingredients used are wholesome and even the fat content comes from almonds & fruit..This has become my staple breakfast for most work days"
4,Very tasty quick snack,I keep these in my work bag I have very odd hours and no time for meal breaks on certain days. They are very good tasting and I the price was the bset I've seen.
4,You'll go bananas,"I love having a Larabar for breakfast each day. The banana bread flavor is delicious and full of healthy fruit and nuts, but after eating the whole pack, I was a little tired of it. Next time, I'm springing for apple pie."
5,These are my favorite bars,"These bars are all natural. Even diabetics can eat them. They're based on dates, but you can taste the coconut too. I eat them nearly every day. They're a little calorie dense, so you have to be careful."
5,Gluten-Free goodness!,"I love the fact that the gluten-free products by larabar say so right on the display box in the store so it takes the guess work out of it for you. They taste just like the flavor they're supposed to and aren't too sweet for a quick snack. They still hold you over until you can get some actual food in your stomach, which is great. I keep these around as much as I can! My favorite GF flavors are key lime pie, pecan pie, apple pie, and banana nut bread."
5,Delicious Healthy Product,"If you love cherry pie, you will love this product. It has the tartness of cherry pie with just the right amount of sweetness. The nuts give it some crunch to make it last a little longer. All natural ingredients with no sugar added make it the perfect snack."
3,"Love Larabars, but this is not the best flavor","We love Larabars, tried some new flavors this week, and the Blueberry is pretty bland. I'd choose other flavors over this one next time."
4,Surprisingly delicious,"I've only had the Apple Pie version, but they are really tasty. It's moist and flavorful and contains only dates, almonds, UNSWEETENED apples, raisins, walnuts and cinnamon. This is an ingredients list I can be excited about. It's a quick, nutritious meal on the go and very nutrient dense, with good fats and almost no sodium at all.I will be ordering these in more flavors. Highly recommended."
2,Ewww....,"The texture of the bar is good, like all Lara Bars. The flavor on the other hand was gross. One of my children likened it to ""Chewing on a rotten Banana Peel""."
5,Review of Tyldesley's 'Daughters of Isis',"Here a great overview of everyday household life in ancient Egyptian culture, given from the central locus of the ancient Egyptian woman. The author uses extensive archaeological and written sources to create a vivid pictures of many, many aspects of Egyptian material culture. The lower and upper classes are considered. There is little overlap between this work and the biographies of Tyldesley, even in the chapter on Female Kings, which makes it a genuinely worthwhile addition to her corpus. Just as those biographies often spilled over to reveal a general history of the period they were set in, so this overview of women in Egypt spills over to talk about all of Egyptian culture."
3,the Americans,"The Americans - Ending to the Kent Family Chronicles. Believe it was a good book , but not up to par with the other books in this saga. It just seemed to stop with no true ending to the family. There still seems to be an untold story yet to tell."
5,The Americans (Kent Family Chronicles),I loved the whole series of Kent Family Chronicles. It makes me wonder about my own family tree. These books also include a great deal of history.
3,The Talents of Hackman and Patton Are Wasted,"The strong performances by Gene Hackman and and Will Patton are even more impressive when contrasted with Kevin Costner's who seems either totally bewildered or under heavy sedation. The plot is implausible. Much of the dialogue is clunky, at times ludicrous. However, director Roger Donaldson somehow captures and then sustains our interest after an unnecessarily slow start. Will the cover-up to protect Secretary of Defense David Brice (Hackman) succeed? To whom does Tom Farrell (Costner) ultimately report? To what extent (if any) will the C.I.A. become involved? Dozens of other actors would have been more effective as Farrell. Perhaps Donaldson and the screenwriters should share the blame with Costner for his tepid performance. At no point do I care what happens to him. Not so with Brice and Scott Pritchard (Patton). This film offers pleasant entertainment which, unlike Seven Days in May and Three Days of the Condor, requires no intellectual engagement."
1,Dissatisfied,"I received the movie I ordered and it cannot be played in the ""region"" in which I live. I would have appreciated knowing that the DVD would only work in certain regions. I believe it should not have been sold to someone who could not watch it in their ""region."" It is basically worthless to me."
4,Exciting but sloppy and unrealistic in some areas,"I watched this movie a couple of years after it first came out and at that time I thought it was an amazing thriller (I was young and didn't know any better), but now after 20+ years and watching it again, I see how cheesy it is at some parts. The overlay of the 80's instrumental music during the love scenes....uggh, so cliche and drippy. And the story itself, the characters in government, how the plot unfolds is just so unrealistic and sloppy. I realize entertainment is entertainment but the writer and director could have firmed up the plot and characters to make them more realistic. Nonetheless, this was a big breakout role for Kevin Costner and he is absolutely hot, hot, hot in this movie. I fell in love with him as an actor in this movie. Overall it is still a good thriller and worth watching."
4,A really good politcal thriller. Good suspense film.,"Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Sean Young, and supporting cast all turn in excellent performances in this underrated but very effective political thriller. This is a very good and effective movie dealing with inside Washington politics and intrigue, and international espionage. The plot moves at a breakneck pace, there are few draggy lulls of the type that plague so many movies these days, and the film never fails to capture and retain the viewer's interest. This is a great ""beer and chips"" film for a Friday evening.No spoilers here, but just let it be said that as one watches the film, it twists and turns and continues to surprise the viewer. Costner is very effective here, Gene Hackman has his usual presence, and overall, this film solidly succeeds in its goal, which is to entertain. Recommended."
5,Sewing Freak,I am a huge fan of Kevin Costner and this is another excellent movie. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Great action adventure with an unpredictable ending,"This movie keeps you interested from begining to the end. Its got Kosner for starters, You get the military spy stuff, the love triangle, the man againgst time and the multiple layers of good guys and bad guys. Good solid acting through out. On top 20 all time favorites. WWWiv"
5,A Must Buy for Costner fans!,"No Way Out is Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman at their bests. This action-packed movie has everything from romance to espionage. Kevin Costner is a naval officer who ties himself up into a world of trouble as he discovers his mistress is the same as the Secretary of Defense.The ending is truly explosive as both Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman, along with a great supporting cast, truly make this movie a must see."
2,One Bad Apple,Some excellent musicians spoiled in my opinion by poor clarinet playing. I don't care if it might be PeeWee Russell. Condon deserves better than this.
3,Rare Birds,"William Hurt stars in this whimsical film about an amazing chef who is separated from him wife living in Washington D.C,He teams up with a zany friend who convinces him to pretent that an extint bird has come back to the island.Crazy government agents a new love interest and amazing food is all ahead of you. Enjoy"
2,boring and messy,"My husband and I both enjoy many different kinds of comedy films, and neither of us enjoyed this boring mess. While the characters were colorful and fun, after a while it seemed that they were just shifted from one goofy situation to another without much linking them.William Hurt is the chef-owner of an unsuccessful restaurant when his friend Phonse comes up with a way to bring tourists to the area -- pretend a rare bird has been sighted. Hurt's performance is good but he has too many ludicrous lines to speak, and the movie never really goes anywhere. We were both very bored watching. My husband eventually read a book, and I only finished so I could write this review in good conscience.Obviously a lot of people really liked this film, so don't take my word for it, but be aware that you may find it really dull.Minimal special features: commentary track with the director; trailer; computer-generated production artwork."
2,Kinda stupid.,"Do not be misled by the packaging of this CD: these are not songs from a quasi-underground electronic music scene in Tokyo nor do these songs possess any sort of urbane sophistication in the tradition trip-hop or European electronica. Instead, the songs on here are really silly and one ballad in particular sounds like Celine Dion on crack cocaine. I never really realized how truly awful Japanese music really is, which is sort of strange because Tokyo is one awesome city. I gave it 2 stars because I really like ""Touch Me, Squeeze Me baby"" by Ice."
1,Rip Off - False Advertising!,"The product picture shows the real MRE crackers and what you get is totally different. Some crappy things they would give you on an airplane. The only thing as far as I can tell, that's similar to an MRE is the entree.Anyway, don't make my mistake an order here if you want real MREs!Yes, I was in the Army for eight years and I know what a real MRE contains."
2,????,Product description did not say it did not come with a way to heat them up. I guess its my fault because it did not say it did either. Who sells MREs without some way to heat them? What am I suppose to do boil water every time or eat them cold? I won't buy again. These are not true Military MREs.
1,Morons,"Be nice if the ""F""ing idiots told you how many MREs you get for 70 bucks plus 23.50 shipping. I can guess how many but add the price and the shipping and they aren't worth close to that."
1,stop,I order for them a month ago. I have always got the stuff i order for within a week or so. But they still have not shipped the stuff i ordered. They will not write you back. They don't care if you need something or not. DO NOT ORDER FOR THEM.
3,Not what's pictured,"The MRE package that I recieved is not the Military issue MRE pictured. I will not open the pack unless an emergency arrises, that's what I bought them for. Just a heads up that it is not what is pictured."
5,Trees of Michigan: Field Guide,This is a user friendly guide for amateurs. Its pocket-sized format makes it easy to take along. The pictures and discriptions are well done and make identification easy. I recommend it for youth and adults.
5,A very helpful guide book,"Easy to read format, well illustrated with good photosincluding photos of the leaves, bark, fruit and flowers.Before you know it, you'll be identifying trees!Quality guide for the price!"
1,Misleading,This is one of those cheaper pretty picture field guides. If you want to know a couple along the drive trees this works. If you want to go any further this book can be misleading. I teach a lab that has a stock pile of this book and I have noticed that several of the photos have abnormal leaf photos and some of the range maps and information are off. This whole series has several problems like this. Good for those who might not otherwise look at plants but if you want to ever really know our trees in Michigan try something else.
4,Another Great by John Shanley,"This has to be rated up there with ""Kissing Christine"" and ""Moonstruck."" I absolutely adore this play. Even though it's categorized comedy, it contains many dramatic and true-to-life issues. The characters are lovable, fun, and incredibly entertaining. It is reality with an extra touch of zaniness and cleverness. I would definitely recommend this to any theatre-goer, especially Shanley fans."
3,Trike Rider,"I would have given it more stars, but had to do modification on the shape for my windsheild. The hardware is OK, but would have perfered to drill my own holes since I have to do the holes in my windsheild. A little over priced for the product."
4,Pretty Good,"Jahanara, Princess of Princesses was a pretty good book. I had to read it a couple of times to get to like it though. The story was full of events and at first, it was hard to sort out. But after the seecond time, I really loved it. Jahanara seemed to be an interesting young woman."
5,An Amazing Book!,"This was an excellent book! It talks about Jahanara, an Indian Princess. A must read for any Kathryn Lasky fan.The book takes place in India ,1627, a time in which Emperor Shah Jahan (Jahanara's father) gained much wealth and power. She was always spoiled, being born to her fathers favirote wife, and was given many jewels, fine cloths, exotic foods, and much more. With all that she had, she still lacked one thing, her freedom. Being hidden behind a veil, hidden from sight, retained her of the freedom which most girls her age should enjoy.This is an excellent book, which speaks of Jahanara's many triumphs, failures, and just everyday life experiences. You won't be able to put it down!"
3,good but factually a tad off!,"The book has passages of great descriptive beauty. The period before Shahjahan's ascension to the Mughal throne and his reign is one of the better known historical facts known to indian history buffs.However Emperor Jahengir was married to Nur Jahan- light of the world, and not Nur Mahal. It's an important detail in the context of this book.Also plotting could have been better, given the mass of intrigue and sibling rivalry that informed the reign of ShahJahan and the later ascension of his son, Aurangzeb."
5,A fine look into Jahanara's life,"While this is different for The Royal Diaries, it is still excellent. The story tells the earlier part of Jahanara's life. She tells of how her father becomes emperor, how her two brothers return to the family, how she fears Nur Mahal (a.k.a. The Snake), and other daily life activities. She and the rest of the women were very confined, and were always behind a screen in public. Later, as Jahanara's life continues, her beloved mother dies while giving birth to Jahanara's sister. The book may be confusing at first, but after a while, it starts to become very interesting. I would recommend this if you enjoyed reading the rest in The Royal Diaries series, or if you are interested in India's history."
3,All right,"This book was okay. I've definitely read better books, this book was rather dull and mundane at times. I was bored reading this, and didn't care for Jahanara's character."
3,"Loaded with sugar, but did work.","I was given a sample of these from the Doctor, and found that they relieved nausea as promised. However, you can only have one every 8 hours and the effect wore off in an hour.Also, these are mostly sugar with added food colouring, (active ingredient is vitamin B6) - so not the healthiest supplement."
1,I seemed to vomit more after eating these,"I bought these hoping they would help with my nausea. Instead, every time I ate one, I threw up promptly thereafter. I've actually had much better luck with preggie pops."
1,Not a Book of Polish Phrases to be shared with Grandchildren,"We were expecting ""common Polish phrases"" which we learned in our Polish homes and parochial school environments; instead upon perusing the book, we came across ""four letter"" word combinations not to be shared with the family......Was just looking for the Polish words for ""grandfather, father, mother, potatoes""....etc.......Was very disappointed......"
1,Broke on third use,"One of the wheels on the largest piece of luggage collapsed on the third use. Good thing this isn't available - don't make the same mistake I made and buy it. The bag had 40 pounds of items in it, and attached to the strap on top - meant to for that purpose, was a bag weighing 12 pounds. It was not over weighted.I will never buy this brand again."
3,Not 6 inches...,"The cover is slightly larger than 6 inches, and will not fit other ""KC style"" lights. Also a bit pricey for what it really is, the plastic feels pretty cheap"
3,"Starts strong, seriously lags in the middle, peters out at the end","The first 150 pages are just terrific but then, once each character is separated, you can tell Tim is ""padding"" the story -- the father spends 30 plus pages lost in the snow while the daughter wanders around at a party for 20 plus pages.And there really is no ""end"" to the story since ""Brand"" just suddenly needs to ""depart."" If a horror writer wants to enter the realm of the supernatural, then he/she needs to create some ""rules"" so we can see the logic of what is happening and why. Tim cops out, giving us a GREAT set up...but seems to have nowhere to go.That being said, his stories are ALWAYS worth reading...even if they don't really ""mean"" anything!"
2,Glad I'm not the only one,"I really had a hard time reading this book. The plot was intriguing at first, but Lebbon played on a lot of tropes, most notably sexual violence against young girls, and it was just repetitive and uninspiring. No real character development to speak of...the dad starts off a weenie and never really becomes anything else. The daughter is a cliche, of course - an oversexed, angsty teenager with a chip on her shoulder - and the mother is a religious zealot who also experienced violence at some point in the past and who I *think* Lebbon was trying to portray as the only virtuous character in the book, which was weird. The only person who doesn't really feel like a victim - predictably and disappointingly - is the father, who again is a most unimpressive person. The characters really are a collection of two dimensional stand-ins, and the villain is rather boring and annoying rather than frightening. It was quite a disappointment."
3,Falls short of writers potential,I enjoyed all the novels written by Lebbon. The only problem with this one was the fact that the reason for Brand's tormenting of this family was never thoroughly explained. I wasn't sure if he intended for the readers to draw their own conclusion or if I missed something.
2,Overwritten and Repetitive,"Having mildly enjoyed Lebbon's ""The Nature of Balance"", I decided to give ""Face"" a try. Well, the beginning is quite gripping and I loved the concept of a family picking up a strange hitchhiker in the middle of a snow storm. It seems that the author started writing with this idea and didn't know where to go with it. Spelling errors aside, Lebbon repeats many of the character's thoughts over and over. Yes, we get the point, you don't need to tell us again! Anyway, having no growth with the characters and a disappointing ending, I cannot recommend this book. Tim Lebbon also seems like he's holding back with scenes, taking the easy way out with his conservative scares and sexual themes. Richard Laymon, Bentley Little, and Tom Piccirilli do it much better."
2,Where's the reason???,"There has to be a reason why Brand is terrorizing this family. You can't put 355 pgs on the basis of ""sometimes bad things happen to good people."" What is that? The way he terrorized the daughter was good--I enjoyed that part, but he could have done a better job with the mom and dad. But you know, this is merely my opinion.--review from the author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow."
1,worst move i have ever seen,i bought it. blame me. my entire family blames me. thought is would be a great family movie night. they will NEVER let me live this night down.
4,Excellent and mellow reggae classic,Expected harder music and was very pleasantly surprised at the album's sound. Great mix of beats and lyrics and fantastic both as a focus and as background. Definitely a classic in the making. Keep a lookout for this Glasgow group's next effort.
4,A must have for MBV/Swerve/90s noise pop fans,"All the influences are here, but distilled into a welcome new sound. The biggest contribution this band makes to the rich legacy of 90s British noise pop is the pleasantly harmonizing boy-vocals taken from the playbook of the current crop of the best pop punk bands.Intense, perfectly tuned, heavily layered wall of sound guitars from Hum, Electro Group, and Swervedriver. Drowsy spaced out interludes from early Verve and Slowdive. Pitchbending first pioneered by MBV. Epic sonic segues over three or more songs, maybe reminiscent of early Ride. And moments of intensity from the more melodic 90s emo bands.My only criticism is that the vocals could benefit from more variety of range, timbre and pattern. Overall, however, this is the proto-shoegazer album I've been waiting for for a long time. And it surely doesn't disappoint the way other modern followers have."
2,Better in the French edition.,"A Frenchman explaining Zen and Japanese gardens, translated into English, makes for an international headache. Some good insights, yes. A lot of pseudo-Zen philosophical nonsense, yes. Best read with a glass of wine (French) in hand."
4,A masterpiece with an intriguing story behind it.,"The legend behind this album is that Eddie himself objected to its being released because he disliked the way it turned out. He apparently hated this album so much that he will never play any of its songs in concert. While not up to the level of albums like ""Super-imposition"", ""Justice/Justicia"" and ""Echando Pa'lante (Straight Ahead)"", this was still a great album."
4,Helped us out,"We used this guide for our cruise through Johnstone Strait at the north end of Vancouver Island in the spring of 2011. The book covers much more but its value is really in the detailed information about J. Strait. There is no other book available that has so much good information about this area and if you are headed up there this is the one to get. Monahan's book is average to below average in other areas he covers and although there are a lot of useful tables and diagrams you can get that sort of thing in any number of other cruising guides, thats why I rate it 4 stars."
5,i love this cd,this is the best cd. the mixes are amazing. lisa lashes did great job mixing it. although both cds have very simular sounds but either way it is a great cd and it is great for parties or anything
1,"Cute, but doesn't work","We just received this in the mail - I ordered it for my daughter's birthday, as she has been wanting her very own Gizmo since I introduced her to the Gremlins movie. The fur is separating from the ear, there is glue on both the eyes, there are random strings coming from the neck and head, it doesn't dance or even move for that matter. It only sings. I tried changing the batteries, in hopes that was the problem, but not the case. I am going to try to order another one and return this one in hopes that we get one that works."
3,Cute,"The toy is called 'Dancing"" Gizmo, but it's just really ""Singing"" Gizmo. The toy is loud so you won't be leaving it on for long as it can get very annoying."
1,Mine Did Not Work !!!,"The one I received sings but does not move. I am having to return it, wondering if I should reorder or just forget it....."
3,okay but flawed,"gizmo looked grate,but on closer inspection the stiching was hanging out and is not made to good, (but i'm still happy i got it).thanks,shoey"
3,One of the most annoying toys you can possibly get...,"As cute as Gizmo is, once he's on, he'll annoy everyone.Sofar my first Gizmo was booted across a room and stopped dancing, the second one was strung up to the roof by a pc's mouse at work."
5,Very Pleased!,"Bought this item for my sister as a Christmas gift, and she cried happy tears. We both was very pleased with this item, the dancing Gizmo pluch doll looks exactly the way it is advertised on Amazon."
1,WHAT A RIP -OFF!,"I bought this for my sons for Christmas. For starters, someone left it on and the batteries were corroded. It worked before I wrapped it. I turned it off. A few minutes later, when the kids unwrapped it, it no longer worked. I've tried everything and NOTHING! IT DOESN'T WORK! The kids were so disappointed. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK!"
5,Gizmo Mania,"He is just too cute, he dances and sings. He'll be a great addition to anyone's 80s collectables! Enjoy him!"
3,no suprises,"This isn't the highest quality product, but after ready the reviews across various sites, i knew what i was getting. it will still be a nice part of our christmas this year."
4,excellent toy,it's hard to find a gremlin dull but this one is excellent. it hasn't broken yet as I read in review from others models. the dancing is nice
4,Gizmo Rocks,"This singing Gizmo, while being very limited in what it can sing, er I mean hum, if fun. My daughters enjoy this toy a lot. Not bad for the price."
5,Gremlins Musical Dancing Gizmo Plush,"I have been promising my daughter a Gizmo doll (her nickname is Gizmo) and when I was told about this, I just had to get it for her. It was more than I excepted (it hums just like Gizmo in the movie Gremlins) I got that for her too. She was so delighted and hugged if though she is 20yrs old. This is an excellent buy and I would tell anyone who loves Gizmo to purchase this one."
4,Gizmo is Great,"My oldest son and his best friend somehow saw the movie ""Gremlins"" recently and they have revived the excitement for anything related to the movie. We were excited that a few items like the Gizmo toy were still available. It is really cute, and the minute it came out of the box my 2 year old had to have one too. Not super durable, but otherwise very adorable and draws compliments wherever we take it."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this for my daughter because she loves to sing and sound like Gizmo when she sings. It didn't work at all! I tried changing the batteries, but nothing. It also is kind of cheaply made. So disappointed because I think she would've loved it, if only it had worked."
3,Candy was fine but not all that sour,The candy was fresh and well packaged but not all that sour. It was certainly more sour than regular airheads but not sour enough for those who want an extreme sour experience.
5,Brilliant scholar! Terrific sensual energy! Hot!,"This book on TQM is among the most respected in the world. Many people seek out Dr. Holly O. Buchanan for advice on this topic and this book is the Rosetta Stone for the balance of her work. She deals with all her innovations in this one slim volume such as prolonged vacuum, extendedknees on the side, and even discusses innovations on eggless french toast. Book is recommended for beginners as the portion relating to Quarto and new office decor are abbreviated and can be found in her other works. Dr. Buchanan has revolutionized TQM concepts in cities such as Portland, Or."
3,ENHANCED???,this sucks!this is pure suckage!just get the original version and stay away from the word enhanced!what a ripoff!
5,all around artist...,This cd displays the all-around talent of Michael Henderson. His vocal range is on display here. Get it...
4,Overall Good CD - Worth the money,"there were a few songs that i didnt like, but i mostly liked them all, 2 Pina Colada's was my favorite though, with Longneck Bottle being no. 2"
5,Another Winner From Garth,"Lots of original songs that didn't make radio here including ""Belleau Wood"", ""A Friend To Me"", ""Take The Keys To My Heart"" and ""Do What You Gotta Do"". These songs are better than his hits ""Long Neck Bottle"" or ""Two Pina Coladas"". Garth was also generous to put 14 songs on this one. I highly recommend it along with ""The Limited Series"" and you will have all of Garth's Stuff except for his ""Chris Gaines"" CD which sounds boring."
2,Not memorable - with a short shelf life.,"After all the hoopla related with Chris Gaines, I was drawn to study this album since it was his last studio album before the Chris Gaines release. The first thing that is striking about Sevens is its short shelf life. It came out about the same time Shania Twain's Come on Over was released. Come On Over is still doing well on the charts while Sevens is history. Why? Sevens just doesn't have a strong theme nor any stand out songs. I still enjoy the Chase because of its strong song selection. But Sevens is another story - it is contrived and made to sound country. The overall feel is there - but the heart and soul is far, far away. And that is probably why the album is all but forgotten. Save your money on this one! Go back about six years and you'll get more for your money."
3,A dissapointed Garth nut,I LOVE Garth and I really don't like this album. It's his worst album and at times depressing! I'm glad this will not be his final original album before he retires I would feel cheated as a die-hard Garth fan.
3,"not his best, but a great shot","I had greatly anticipated this album, and for good reason. Seeing him live 15 times, and meeting him on several occasions, even singing his music with my band, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this album. When I got it, I was pleased, but not as I should have been. Although the songs are great, they are unpersonal to him, and there is a lack of heart behind the songs that was present in songs like ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" and ""Unanswered Prayers"". The only other problem lies not with Garth, but with producer Allan Reynolds. Please, for the sake of all us musicians, stop robbing the life of the music. The guitars and drums sound so 'produced' that they have no life of their own. Give the music it's personality back... PLEASE. I hope Garth's next effort will be a little more personal, have a little color in the music. It would have gotten 4 stars, but the overproduction just kills me."
1,0 Stars Not An Option,"Trailer Park Trash. Garth Brooks is far superior at The business of being Garth, than he could even pretend to be as a musician."
1,"seven, six, five, four, three, two ONE",Should have been called ONES. That's how many stars this piece of schlock is worth. Of course that's an insult to stars. Garth - your trailer park trash isn't working. Tornados are killing all your fans.
1,Pity there isnt a 0 star rating available,I've got a brand new combine arvester and I'll give you the keys.....
5,I loved it so much I immediately went out and bought it.,This is the best Garth Brooks album yet. If he keeps doing what he's doing...he'll never get old. I love Garth Brooks and will be a huge fan for life.
3,A little too Country for me!!,"I have loved most of Garth's former albums, so when I opened this one up I figured it would be a sure hit with me. However, it seems that most of this album is the ""old country"" sound where you hear about his ""...women leaving him and his dog dying."" I guess I liked his rock type country music. Still a good album if Country ""Country is your music."
4,"Lots of good, a little ok","There are of course some amazing classics on this album, ""Longneck Bottle"" and ""Two Pina Coladas"" to name a couple. I was also pleasantly surprised by ""You move me"", ""She's gonna make it"" and ""Belleau Wood"".But there were a couple songs that show Garth was definitely getting towards that experimental time in his career that it seems everyone has to go through. ""Fit for a King"" and ""When there's no one around"" were fun, but kinda weird. Couldn't really get my head around them.Even with the CD equivalent of these crazy Side B songs, the CD was totally worth it. Perhaps I'm a little Garth crazy, but I can start on ""Garth Brooks"" by Garth Brooks and go straight through 7 more albums of his."
3,Jane Fonda Prime time: Firm and Burn Low Impact Cardio,I like this aerobic workout but I find it a little too fast paced for me right now. I'll keep trying until Ican use and enjoy it
5,One of four discs,Another great workout disc. Keep in shape. There are four of these discs and we own them all. We got them here at Amazon.com.
4,Good routine,"I still have to practice a little bit more, but I think is a good routine. It really make me sweat!"
5,Firming and Burning....,"This is a great workout to do at home...entertaining, do-able and impacting. My goal is to be firmer, burn calories and maintain core body strength. Jane's video fits my needs for a low-impact workout."
3,It is better than not doing anything.,I tried it once and did get some sore muscles so it worked but i don't think it will be challenging enough for this 59 yr. old in moderately good shape. I will be quickly bored.
4,Over 50 - dance aerobics,"I like this since it is a good choice for someone over 50, however, I am not fond of the dancing. I am not into dancing like this so it is probably not the best choice for me. I have done 2 of the 3 --- the 50's & a Latin version. I suppose it will get better once I am familiar with the steps but it is personally not my favorite of her videos. I do not like the live band- I don't know why- I guess I grew up with loud rock n-roll ! LOL!"
4,Get's you moving,"This video from Jane Fonda is fun and gets you moving. I enjoy it to loosen up my joints without hurting anything. I have MS so struggle with good and bad days with my body. This is gentle enough for anyone, I love that you can move and enjoy the music, the time goes by fast and you have had a good work out. She stays with some of the moves long enough to give you a good sweat. Finally one for aging bodies that want to get fit. We wish we still moved the way we did but we don't so this video I feel is helping me to get back into shape safely. Love it!"
4,Great low impact dance routine!,I am 64 and love this cardio..I can't do zumba because of back problems and this cardio has different dance styles to keep you enthused and also keeps ya hummin' to do a lil sweatin'...
4,I liked it.,Good starter work out dvd. not too streneous but enough sweat for an older folks work out. I enjoyed it.
3,Not a good fit,"Although this video got me to sweat, it wasn't nearly challenging enough. Maybe I'll try it again in about 10 years. I'm 53, in reasonable shape, and use exercise videos to spice up my routine and to push myself. It doesn't help that my two left feet aren't made for dancing; my feet moved in ways that bore little resemblance to the group on the screen. I may pass it along to one of my older senior friends, or just hang onto it for when I'm older, or as a way to ease back into working out after an illness."
4,Good low impact workout,"This workout video by Jane Fonda is a good, low impact workout. She does a good job of demonstrating the simple moves, and encourages you to warm up and cool down. Even though this is a low impact workout your muscles will feel stretched and your heartrate will increase. My one complaint: I can't hear the music! Ms. Fonda is showing you dance moves and telling you to feel the rhythm and have fun, but I can't hear the music. I have found this on other instructors' work out tapes also, you can't hear the music. I would love to feel the rhythm but the music is so much a part of the background I only hear Ms. Fonda's instructions. Kinda frustrating and disappointing to me."
3,exercise,I'm in my 60's with hip problems. Not really the exercise video for me. I can't get past the warm up :(
3,Jane Fonda Video,I used the video about 5 times and it quit on me. I liked the music and the content but was very disapointed that it didn't last.
1,sent the wrong dvd,"Ordered the Jane Fonda excercise DVD ensuring I ordered from the Australian market but when my purchase arrived it has an American zone of ""1"" and Australian DVD's need to be ""4"" so all of my four purchases can not be played in Australia. Oh well won't order DVD's on line again. :("
5,Excellent!,This is a great workout for seniors in good health. I've been exercising to Jane Fonda since the 80's and I trust and enjoy her.
5,Jane's my favoriate,I really enjoy working out with Jane Fonda. I've been her fans for many years when she had her VHS workout in the 80's and 90's.The reason I like Jane Fonda and Leslie Sansone's vedio's are that they workout with you. Makes you feel like they are right there as a team. They don't give instructions and walk around like they're sargents.This video is fun and I like dancing to all three different type of music. Dancing is the best ways to burn calories and stay fit.
3,An Hour is too long!,I'm 60 and want to get in shape. I love Jane Fonda and her workouts. I found the workout to be fun and easy but I don't have time to spend an hour to do it. Two 30 minute workouts would have been better for me.
4,Not a Dead Head and I still like it,"This was my kids fault! Rock Band II has the song ""Alabama Getaway"" A very playable, sing-a-long song that was recorded about 10 times at many different venues. I sampled many of them on line found this version very fun to listen to. They rest of the cd was a surprise, it was fun too! I'm not a Dead Head, but I've enjoyed my first Grateful Dead experience!"
3,The weakest of the Dick's Picks series,"I've had soundboards of this show for several years prior to Dick's Pick's Six. Those tapes tended to gather more dust than not: Sadly, the same case has happened to the CD version.The problem, simply put, is that despite a somewhat unusual setlist, the band's playing is sloppy more often than not. It's one thing to expect the occasional mistake, but when mistakes predominate (Estimated Prophet, for example), that takes away from the overall flow of the music in general.If anything, Dick picked the incorrect show from this run. Two nights later, the band played a monster second set -- including inspired versions of favorites like Playing In The Band, Terrapin Station, I Need A Miracle, Bertha and Casey Jones -- that hit such a stride that it makes Dick's Picks Six sound like Herman's Hermits!"
4,2nd Disk Is Killer,"A solid show, but the highlight is an amazing second disk, that offers one of the most intense Other Ones ever. The second disk is worth the price of the whole set, and is essential for any deadhead."
5,Shakedown to the bone,"Good first set! Bob really gets it going with C.C. Rider. But, the 2nd set is awesome!!! Really incredible. Shakedown Street really stands out for me on this CD. Especially the last five or six minutes of it....the jam is .......WOW!!!"
3,"Readable, yes, but for the wrong reasons","As the translator (Mary M. Innes) herself will tell you in the introduction, many of the standard conventions of Latin poetry have been stripped out of this prose translation. While this certainly makes the stories more readable, it also removes everything which makes this work ""Ovidian."" If you're reading the book simply for its description of classical mythology, you probably won't mind. Anyone attempting to get a handle on Ovid himself should look elsewhere (I personally recommend the Mandelbaum translation, but as with all translated literature, nothing is quite perfect. Learning some latin wouldn't hurt you anyway, now would it? :-) )."
2,Kindle Edition is not Mandelbaum,"The stars are for the Kindle link, which is bad advertising. (I give Mandelbaum's translation itself 5 stars.)Amazon's main page for Mandelbaum's translation links to a prose version by Henry T Riley, ""literally translated, with notes and explanations"" (that's not a misprint, folks). As far as I can tell, there is no Kindle version of Mandelbaum. The Riley text is tedious; footnotes and explanations follow each fable. This might be helpful for academic purposes, but there's no enjoyment in it. Until Mandelbaum shows up for e-reading, get Horace Gregory's translationThe Metamorphosesif you want a good, readable verse version for Kindle."
5,Recoverey Form Cults and Abusive Relationships,"I have not actually read the book yet but in browsing, it covers every imaginable situation one could face and how to deal with it. I am looking forward to reading it.Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships"
5,Excellent Resource!,"Since leaving the cult Eckankar in 1998, and spending a lot of time on the internet trying to help others wake up, get out, and recover, I've read a lot of books on the subject of cults. ""Take Back Your Life"" is one of the best!! An invaluable resource for both recovering cultists and people involved in abusive relationships, and concerned friends and family members."
5,Beautiful Filming and Interesting Interviews,"Having foundMysteries of the Jesus Prayerto be intellectually shallow, I moved on to this program which I think is substantially better. After reading a lot about the Byzantine Empire, which initially supported the monasteries on Mount Athos, I had bought one of the several books on the suject, which I found to be unsatisfactory because of its black and white photographs. What this program makes clear is what a beautiful place Mount Athos is, both in terms of its natural surrounding and the stunning architecture.While the interviews with the monks are short (the entire program only lasts 25 minutes), I found them to be quite interesting, unlike those in Mysteries of the Jesus Prayer.All in all, an interesting and enjoyable program."
2,Same ol stuff,"I bought this book because I liked the last version and this one was going to deal with Flash 5. It's a real pretty book and the CD is real nice, but the content is boring. It seems like every chapter dealt with creating horrible 3D effects with Flash's primative x,y,z axis commands in actionscript.Only Gabriel's chapter really pulls off a neat 3D trick, everybody else is just making cheesy wire frame navigations.I noticed another technique, which is covered twice in the book, is getting the date and time to display in flash, VERY exciting stuff here.Granted, if you like this sort of stuff the book covers it really well. If you're looking for diverse techniques from a variety of artists, you are going to be disappointed. Skim it in a bookstore and just set it down..."
5,This book rules!,"This is the coolest book I have ever seen, unlike any other book out there. Includes tutorials, background information, and more. If you love Flash, this book must be in your collection."
5,A Great book!,"This book is a showcase of the best flash sites arond. New masters of Flash Annual 2002 is the secound of new masters series. This book revels the secrets of best flash designers and showcases their work. This book also contains some hard tutorial information on how to build top class effects.The reader of this book should be experienced in the Flash environment, and who know some ActionScript."
5,Genius,"Is it wrong to use the word 'genius' when talking about web designers? I would have said no before reading this work, but now I'm not so sure! A fantastic reference work which is surely a 'must-buy' for any aspiring web designers out there..."
1,crass,along with family guy-- this will be the LOWEST POINT of ANY TV annimation seriesand TED on fekkin big screen- UGH !!!Well I've said it- what passes for creativity these days is--------
2,Disc 2 was not readable.,"I purchased this dvd set for Christmas. When we tried to watch disc 2, it would stop in the middle of an episode. I tried to clean it and play it time and again. It didn't work. I noticed a flaw in the disc. It wasn't a scratch. It was a slight ""bubble"" in the disc."
3,"Good, but limited","This is a good magazine for progressives and liberal-minded folks. The magazine uses the same authors and writers for each issue. This is both good and bad. Good because you get to know the writing style, ideas and thoughts from these writers; they become kind of like friends after a while. Bad because you get the same views all the time; there's no diversity and it feels a bit in-bred.Still a quality magazine with passionate articles about things that really matter."
4,Digital Fisheye for Pentax,Every bit as advertised. A most unusual lense. It takes a while getting use to the lack of an apature ring but the lense is everybit worth it. If you are in a small room and need to take in the whole room this is the lense for you. The Lense is as sharp as all of the other pentax lenses that I have and the depth of field is tremendous.[...]
2,Disappointing quality Lens,"inexpensive and fun but poor quality, I love Pentax lenses, but this one is worth the money. Fun too bad there's not a option for a higher quality version, would be worth paying for, Love the 12mm-24mm Lens I bought from them though"
5,Great Lens,"I got this lens for use in making HDR 360 x 180 stitched panoramic images.It has a nice sharp focus, and minimal chromatic aberration.Overall, I am very satisfied with this lens."
5,Change up!,"I have the Pentax 12-24 lens already, but found that I really wanted something that was going to offer another perspective. The DA 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 ED(IF) by Pentax offers a fish-eye look at 10mm while having minimal distortion by 17mm. Colors are great (as is typical w/ Pentax lenses) and the sharpness of this lens is excellent. There are some scenes where a fisheye is just fun and adds interest to the picture. Definately not an all purpose lens, but it's so small and light it's easy to have in the bag for when the situation warrants it.Only downside is that adding a filter on it is pretty much impossible as the integrated lens hood combined w. the ultrawide field of view makes using a filter much more difficult."
5,Great RPG,I bought this game for my PSP since new rpg's for this system are rare. This game is great and I have not finished as of this review. Graphics are great as is the story line. Hard to put down once you start playing and the game is long in playing time.
4,Good information,I bought this for my father. He loves old/classic cars and he seems to enjoy this magazine. I think it's a must for classic car junkies!
1,Broke during second use.,"Gave this to my 7.5-year-old son. There are metal rings on the underside to hold the pins that push into the ground and secure the pitcher's plate in the ground. While using it for the second time, the rubber along the edge of one of the rings cracked almost completely around the ring. We only used it in our grass backyard for family baseball games...not even real baseball on dirt with a team of boys."
3,music compilation,"eh, its ok. there is a ton of noise on this album that i guess i forgot about in the dialog of the movie. for the price i found it at, i am pleased with the 3 songs i DO like in here. it arrived quickly and in one piece."
3,Fly Journal (not including the Fly Journal pen),"This is a very neat little journal, but I didn't feel like paying so much for the electronic pen that comes with it, so I ended up simply writing in it with a normal pen, without all the extra features. I enjoyed completing this journal, despite the lack of the features that purchasing the pen would have given me access to. It's stylish and unique. Very cool."
5,The Doors,"This is the best set you can get, it has all of their greatest hits, along with Jim Morrison on each of the songs."
2,Nice but picture is misleading,"The bag is a nice quality bag but the picture of how the chair actually fits in the bag is misleading. The curved hooks of the chair actually sticks out on either side of the bag. The bag does not fully enclose the chair like it is pictured. It does make it cumbersome to use because if you don't ensure the screws are locked, the sides will slide out if the bag is tilted or turned upside down. I've contacted Handysitt by email to enquire about this but have not yet received a response."
5,one of Blegvad's best,"By far, this is one of his best records. Quirky and very literate all at the same time....he's got an AMAZING voice as well....buy ALL his stuff :)"
4,Inspirational & Unique,"I love this cd! I thank God for allowing original unique artists because this artist really came straight from the heart. The songs like Worship the King, Breathe and Pray are relaxing heartfelt songs that make you want to keep hittin the replay button. This album is very inspiring like a testimony which really speaks to my heart. There are a couple of songs on the album that I thought didn't quite fit, but for the most part overall this is a really awesome project! It takes me back to the days when the Clark Sisters first emerged & when Yolanda Adams brought their contemporary styles to the forefront, it was different, unique, yet powerful."
3,Elizabeth,"While Gillingham and Stillman were certainly early pioneersin dyslexia, their work could be seen to be dated,as they have been dead for almost fifty years. It is not theirfault that much more is known now about dyslexia than whenthey were alive, but it does make them dated and in some casespotentially damaging if their theories are not appliedtogether with more modern knowledge. This is not a questionof being an ""amateur"" or not, but simply having knowledgethat extends beyond Gillingham Stillman. Unfortunately, muchOrton Gillingham training in the US seems to regard externalinterests and knowledge from trainees as a threat, and claimsto be the only effective program, despite many students makinglittle progress on unmodified Orton Gillingham. I would onlyuse this manual with together with the understandinggained from modern research."
5,My favorite homeschooling book by far...,"Until I read this book cover to cover I didn't know why I felt so much pressure as a new homeschooling mother. This book took all the guilt out of it for me. I realized, through so many varied opinions, that homeschooling is a joy, not a task and that I didn't need to wake up at 7am and crack the whip, standing before a homemade chalk board. I realized I am an unschooler who follows a VERY flexable cirriculum through reading this book. Thank you to the authors of it. It really eased my mind and help me find my way. I have set my fear aside and won't allow others who do not homeschool try to instill THEIR paranoid fears into us. I truly realized now that my children will learn and I don't have to get all bent out of shape over it. I feel free, thank God."
2,A disappointment due to its limited perspective,"As a parent new to the idea of homeschooling, I was hoping that the Homeschooling Book of Answers would provide me with a broad scope of ideas and opinions on the subject. Although it proports to encompass the views of ""39 respected mentors,"" all 39 come from the same educational philosophy; each question is answered by several people, but all of the answers are maddeningly similar. The contributors share an ""unschooling"" philosophy, which often means not only that they believe in ""child-centered learning"" but also in not teaching at all and in the idea that schooling is inherently bad. Anyone looking for a balanced view that represents a range of homeschooling philosophies, families, and experiences had best look elsewhere. One recommendation is David Guterson's Family Matters, an excellent, intelligent, balanced primer on the subject of whether or not to homeschool, beautifully written by a high school teacher/homeschooling father."
1,very misleading title-NOT about homeschooling,"This book is not at all helpful to anyone who wants to homeschool and learn more how to get started doing that. This book is about unschooling, a technique I do not agree with and am not interested in doing. I was very disappointed, it didn't answer one of my questions. It reminds me of a talk-show written in book form."
2,If I read this book I would likely become paranoid and still have no answers,"Being managed by a boss whos major goal seems to be to trip me up and damage my career if possible, I have adopted a couple of strategies. None of them are mentioned in this book. One has to understand that the bully usually is yout supervisor and is not willing to play fair. If you want to survive you will need to adopt a box of tricks and be very resourceful. You have to understand that you are dealing with a psychologically sick person. You will have to get inside their mode of operation and I did not find ways to do that in this book.Books I would recommend are: Tongue Fu! by Sam HornGet Anyone to Do Anything, by David LiebermanEmotional Vampires, by Albert Bernstein"
1,"Dial Speedometer 20"" Wheel Bicycle Bike","This speedometer was inoperable - the needle simply jumped around. something inside is stuck. I was able to use the cable and sending unit which mounts on the wheel hub with my old speedometer, whose cable had broken."
4,Good textbook covers essentials,"Stewart gives students all they need, in a direct approach to the style - that is, through the music rather than the species method used by some books. The included anthology and exercises are big plusses. Drawbacks are a dry, outline format and some confusing notation in the examples of stylistic and non-stylistic practice. I teach this style each year and this has been my substitute for Tom Benjamin's out-of-print book. I'm quite happy with it."
2,Boring and Too Much Civil Rights,"This novel, by the director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, is based on the life of Bishop James A. Pike. Rather dull all the way through and too heavily weighted on Pike's (I mean Roy Train's) involvement in civil rights. Would have liked more heresy, seances, and gnosticism. Philip K. Dick's novel about Bishop Pike,The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, is a thousand times better. Alternatively, read William Stringfellow and Anthony Towne's excellent biography,The Death and Life of Bishop Pike: An Utterly Candid Biography of America's Most Controversial Clergyman (William Stringfellow Reprint)."
3,dreamy and romantic,"I enjoyed most of this romantic album except for #6 Amor de Loca Juventud. It started out as a pretty song but then, halfway through the song, an awful-sounding voice speaking some English lyrics jarred me out of my dreamy mood. He sounded like a very raspy Wolfman Jack. I thought that his voice and his ""yeah, baby"" ruined the song and that is why this cd only gets 3 stars instead of 4. There is a lovely slow dance version of Guantanamera but no one can top Celia Cruz's version. Although you don't need the English translations to enjoy his music, it is an extra pleasure to read them and get more out of Segundo's music."
5,Awesome,"Every possible CD that Brian has made is totally superb. Brian is totally awesome, I had the privelege of being at several of his concerts back in Northern Ireland and not only is he worth listening too his is a humble yet exceptionally talented man. Try to buy as many of his albums as you can, he is big back home!"
4,excellent,"we are using this stand to hold a rather heavy Pantheon Steel Halo drum and not a snare. Given that our hand pan is heavier than a snare, I bet this stand works wonders on snare drums"
4,"Excellent compilation of Palmieri""s 70's period!","This set would get five stars if only the sound would be better. That said, all the hits are here. Songs like ""Puerto Rico"" and ""Nada de Ti"" are classics from Palmieri""s 70's discography on Coco records. The vocalists are Ismael Quintana and Lalo Rodriguez. Band members are Barry Rogers, Nicky Marrero, Alfredo de la Fe and other great session musicians. This is a ""must-buy"" cd."
5,1985 J-Pop Superstar Mascot Bubbly Sayuri!,"Dreambox is a stuffed 2005 collection of 58 of Sayuri's songs from her young superstar career, primarily 1983-1986. The box includes a 40 page booklet of lyrics and photos, a 2005 introduction by the now beautiful married professional mother and broadcaster Sayuri Iwai, and even a cardboard puchout desk ornament. And songs! all her A side singles, all the B side singles, and 33 more album songs. And a DVD! She's so sweet."
4,Nice watch,"This watch is not big and bulky, coming in under 40mm. It is also pretty thin. It would be five stars if the metal of the band felt more solid. Seems like it will scratch up pretty quick. The face is great. Its darker than it appears in the picture, which I like. Overall for the low price it's a great deal."
2,Not impressed...,"I expected more from this video. It was more like a home movie. I did not finish watching it. Sorry, but it is not on my top-ten list..."
3,Zippy The Pinhead ALIEN ! Lives !!,"[...]""Can You Keep A Secret ?""First off please GOOGLE `Zippy The Pinhead',Weird huh ?,Phil is Zippy,Zoppy is Phil.(period)We kept squinting at the screen to make sure,This wasn't MOBY pulling a fast one.UFO PHIL has a sincere claim to fame,His songs were on Dr. Demento Radio Show,Hey- It did wonders for Weird Al Yankovic .Phil visits a- Karate Studio(with mixed results,That kid did a low blow in fight),Insurance company(Trying to get alien abduction insurance),Hardware Store(This goes on & on with wonderful cinema moments).The filmakers brag on using multiple cameras,Cheap...But multiple.This could be PEREZ HILTON impersonating an alien ?There is one touching segment that makes you think of Michael Jackson's Neverland and others abusing the star to their own agendas,But they dont Kill Phil !Ends in one of those goal full-filling concerts,Seen a million times,But with a bigger budget(The others,Not UFO Phil).CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET ?"

5,Jessica and Lila fight over Lucas,"On a Skiing trip,The Sweet Valley High schoolers meet Lucas King,a cute Skiing Instructor in which Jessica and Lila both have crushes,but Jessica calls the front desk and cancels Lila's Wake-Up call. Meanwhile,Todd and Cassandra[A divorcee] are trapped in a Avalanche,when a big ball of Snow heads right towards them when Todd and Elizabeth are Skiing.Seperating them.You will never find out who Lucas ends up with."
3,ana.ssl,"This book taught us(well,some of us)something about boys: Never let a guy come between you and your best friend,it's just not worth it.There are guys everywhere in the world,but best friends are harder to find than anyone knows."
3,A fun book you should read,"This is a book you'll be sure to enjoy. Kate William shows what happens when two girls fight over one guy, and who gets him at the end. It's really funny to see them compete, and as you will see, the end is surprising"
5,corelle plates,I bought these for my daughter-in-law as a gift. They arrived in time for me to give them for her birthday.
5,MAKES ME WANT TO SEE WESTERNS AGAIN,"Most of these 2cds collections have just about the same tunes with a few exceptions.I would have included the theme from THE VIRGINIAN tv series.Nevertheless, what we have here is a superb collection of western themes that displays different moods.The MORRICONE tunes are so well known that we take them for granted.I had forgotten that STAGECOACH had such a good score.Among my favorites are THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN,HOW THE WEST WAS WON and the wonderful JOHN DUNBAR THEME from DANCES WITH WOLVES.So get back in the saddle again and get this one.You'll want to see at least THE BIG VALLEY and BONANZA again.There is a mistake among the titles represented here on the AMAZON site.This is not a good reason enough for you to miss your rendez-vous with past heroes.After all,even AMAZON needs a sheriff to lead their staff of reviewers.The one mistake is that MCBAIN is not here,it's THE COMANCHEROS.Did i heard you say that they are both JOHN WAYNE films?"
4,Western Film Themes,"The music on this CD is done very well.There is an old saying, ""Less is More;"" I think I would have enjoyed this CD more if the were fewer songs because after so many Western themes, it becomes monotonous."
2,Manufacturing quality poor,"I have been using this product for years to help me read and sleep in peace and quiet. However, the manufacturing quality of these earplugs has diminished over time. The earplugs length has gotten shorter and shorter. Consequentially, the sound attenuation is less effective now. Also, it is easier for these shorter earplugs to get stuck in the ear canal. On top of that, I think they changed the foam type used in the earplugs to a type of foam with poorer attenuation characteristics. I suspect these were all cost cutting measures. But, the consequences might be hearing loss for those people who use the earplugs to protect their ears from high decibel environments. I plan to switch to a different brand."
3,EAR Plugs,I have been using this product for over 20 years and these don't seem to expand the way they once did
4,EAR yellow earplugs,Excellent product. Use these everyday during the warm weather for motorcycling. They work the best of all the earplugs I have used.
5,Love These!,"My husband brought these home from work one day, and I used them and they worked great!! They are soft and keep out the sound of my husband and dog snoring!! Highly recommend them."
5,Comfortable,I finally needed to order more hearing protection. I have worn this type for years. I couldn't be more satisfied. I use these at home as well as at work. They are very confortable and conform to ear canal.
3,WORKS OK,"The ear plugs works OK, it did not block as much sound as I had hoped. I used the same brand ear plug before and guess they have different models."
5,Great Deal! Great product!,"These earplugs have always been a favorite when workingaround aircraft and shops with high speed machinery.I ordered a box of 200 pair and split the costWith 2 coworkers. For less than the price of 2 pair at Sears,we got 66 pair each!!! Great deal!!!"
5,For the hard of hearing.,Love these plugs and the way they are packaged seperately. I actually was introduced to these plugs about a year ago when visiting my audiologist.
5,Great value great noise blocking. four more words,"Just as usual, great earplug. Terrific blocking of very loud environment, disposable clean, comfortable, and cheap. four more words one more word"
3,work okay but a little bit grainy and rough,"I'll admit it, I bought these because they were cheaper than the hot pink and yellow plugs. Well, after one night of using them I know why-- they are a bit rough on the ear. I thought they had a grainy feel that I didn't notice in my prior pair. It seemed like my ear canal was a bit tender after a night of use. As far as sound blockage goes they were just fine, now if only I could find a product that would block out the thumping sensation that comes through the floor when somebody with giant woofers drives by at 2 a.m."
3,not what I ordered,"The product is good. The problem is I've ordered a different product, the ""long"" version of those earplugs. It seems the company do not produce them anymore, so they sent me the ""classic"" ones, that are too short to be very efficient. Now I'm stock with 200 of them in a large box. Sending them back would cost me a fortune."
4,Good if you hate muffs,"I work in the turbines business and I have used many types of plugs and yes it is one of the best in the market. Of course you can not compare it to an ear muff since muffs are much far better, but really annoying especially if you are working in a hot weather.Finally these plugs are not designed to be in your ears for a long time, just a two hours job then you get rid of them."
4,Stay'n with the classic,"I've tried softer earplugs with inadequate results. Went back to these, and they do a great job of muffling all the noise coming off the crackhouse next door."
4,Great book for first time teachers and students,"It's simple and to the point. Short power lessons are introduced at appropriate times. My 12 year old pick right up on it quickly. I also like how it encorporates the keyboard (techno) buttons into ""old fashioned"" piano lessons."
1,A Review of This Book Isn't Title-Worthy!,">>>Gret Read, October 5, 1999 Reviewer: A reader from Tuscon At times it appears to be a bit far fetched, but the bottom line is that Celine did marry a man 27 years older than her. I really appreciated the insight into the early part of her career.<<<26 years, and who on Earth has the right to criticize?As far as I'm concerned, if she truly loves Renee, then it only makes sense that they married. It is no ones' right to discriminate something simply because it is uncommon, especially something this personal, and in this day and age.There have been lots of false things written about this woman, but this is by far the worst ever!!!! As one of my fellow reviewers stated, ""NO CELINE FAN SHOULD TOUCH THIS BOOK""! I for one am sorry I didn't heed that advice."
1,Absolute RUBBISH!,"This book is nothing except rubbish! It is only a glorified tabloid! It is a complete waste of money. True Celine fan's will recognise this book as total and utter ****. It is very unfair to the diva who has touched the lives of so many people. Once again, Celine is NOT ANOREXIC! If you want a good read on Celine, try the Grill' biography 'Falling into You', or 'A Voice and a Dream'."
1,Complete Fiction,"This is the worst type of biography for Celine Dion. Not only do I feel the stories are false, but the author mixed up the facts. The birthplace of Celine Dion is outside of Montreal, not Quebec City."
1,It is absolutely garbage!,"This book doesn't even deserve a star. How can one believe such outrageous claims on a person as nice as Celine. Not doubt that I am a big fan of her. I have been to her concert in Hong Kong. It was just amazing how Celine can touch everyone's heart on stage not only with her great voice, but also with her great personality. She let the Hong Kong tabloids to take all the pictures they want whether she was on stage or having a shopping spree on the street. She has such a down to earth character that makes her so lovable. I don't think anyone that is as unhappy as the author had described in the book can deliver such giving and unbelievablly wonderful performance. Unofficial means no proof! So Trash this piece of garbage!"
1,What a bunch of bull!,"This book is nothing but a vicious lie about Celine's life. I find it very hard to believe that she broke up her manager's marraige and treats her staff as badly as the book says she does, The book also says how Celine's marraige to her husband is hell. I don't believe that! Buy only this book if you hate Celine or if you want eveything on her!"
1,Poorly Written and Mostly False,"This book portrays Celine Dion in a very negative way overall. The lasting impression that one has at the end is that she is a weak person with very little inner strength and self esteem. This is not so. You can tell that almost everything, with the exception of a few things, is false in this book. The auther is incorrect on very basic facts on Celine, so what can he know about supposedly secret ones. Read this book if you want, but know that the whole story is made up. I recommend reading the authorized biography which gives a great amount of insight into and information about Celine's life and career."
1,"AWFUL!!! the worst celine dion book out there, don't read!!","full of lies! Celine is the sweetest person ever and as a fan, this makes me sick. come on people, we know the truth about celine! this book is no better than any tabloid, it's full of lies just meant to gain book sales. Ian Halperin doesn't care about Celine or anyone he mentioned in the book. Celine luvs Rene and her life and she would never try to commit suicide, and SHE'S NOT ANOREXIC!!! if you want a good bio, read tour de force by hebert georges-germain, or it's canadian version called Celine also by hebert, it's the only authorized book out there, and very good! email me for more info if you'd like"
1,This book is not worthy of the paper its written on,This book is full of wrong dates and misnamed songs. The credibility factor went downhill from there. Its really a piece of junk.
1,Garbage,"Poor Céline! How could anyone believe, let alone write any of this junk about our beloved chanteuse? And let me say once and for all, because I'm sick of hearing it...SHE IS NOT ANOREXIC!!!!! If you have ever seen that girl eat, you know that's true...she loves food. I don't think she could be anorexic. And suicide attempts, please. She's always smiling. She is an inspiration and role model to people everywhere. Don't believe a word of this FICTION NOVEL. If you want her real life story read her official bio, or if you don't speak french, try the Barry Grills one Falling Into You. It's not as excellent as the official one, but better than this trash."
5,quick ship thank you!!,thank you for the quick ship the book was as described. nice note enclosed with book - thank you :-)
3,Cute but annoying as hell,"I like that it talks, but I wish that it wouldnt loop twice EVERY TIME it talks. Kind of pushes it over the edge of being ""cute"" annoying into throw-it-against-the-wall-annoying"
4,"""London Betty"" Review","Betty has moved across the pond to become a real life American reporter, but when her first story assignment turns out to be just another fluff piece she begins to think twice about the move. Discouraged and looking for allies Betty forms an unlikely bond with the neighborhood thieves and together they set out to investigate the town's crooked Mayor. Betty might just get her first real news story, but she'll have to be in cahoots with thieves to get it.This indie film is awesome!!! Thomas Edward Seymour directed the film, who has an ample amount of experience in the indie film business. This quirky comedy will definitely bring you a few laughs and completely entertain throughout the entire film. Check your local retailers like Walmart, Redbox, Blockbuster, Netflix, and Bestbuy. I am postive you will not be disappointed, enjoy!*Sponsored Post"
1,I guess you HAD TO BE THERE,"I don't see anything new in this film, honestly. It's a little less than what I expected, and it's very cliche. I don't understand why people think because a film is indie, it has lower standards...or that the indie viewer has lower standards.As usual, you can tell that this film is full of amusing one-liners and inside jokes that the cast and crew may be aware of, but as the viewer, don't waste my time. If you ""had to be there"" to understand it, then save it for your home movies! I personally am insulted. This was a hack film."
4,nice,"I purchased this book as a guidline for Devotions during advent. For the most part, I think it is a pretty good book. It is a little dated and some things I did not agree with. We were able to make it work for us and changed a few things to meet our needs or discussed what was written in the book and why we did not believe some of the things that it said."
5,We Light The Candles,"This is the third year we have used this book for family evening devotionals during advent. We also have a simple advent wreath with candles that we light as we do each devotion. The devotions are short, sweet and to the point and perfect for families with small children, older children with attention issues, families with multiple ages, or a family who wants to fit in a nightly devotion and only has 5 - 10 minutes. All of our children, and adults, look forward to this time every evening and we feel it would bless other Christian families."
4,Very Helpful Addition to Advent,"Some of the services in this book are just lovely, and bring tears to my eyes. We haven't gone through the entire thing (it's December 11), so I'll update you when we're finished.Update: this is good, but not as good as the advent services I remember from my childhood. So I'll keep looking."
4,"Great dictionary, ok software","Before purchasing I did a lot of reading and felt this was the best out there for a Spanish-English CD, and I am not disappointed.With the other reviews I agree that the thoroughness of this dictionary is outstanding. Most words are put in a variety of contexts to show different usages including common idiomatic expressions and regional expressions according to country. I use it daily as an essential tool in studying Spanish.However, as a sofware product at $50 it is pretty lousy. The design is clumsy. The search is awkward and very limited, that is, you can't look up combinations of words in quotes. Still, all things considered, this does not hold it back from being worth the price. For the basics it's very easy to use and I recommend it."
5,Oxford Spanish Dictionary - CD-ROM,"If you are serious about learning/improving your Spanish, buy it! This is a Spanish/English English/Spanish Dictionary. It is wonderful because not only does it have tons of entris but it seems to have examples for all if not most of its entreis. Example, say you want to learn the word ""flat"" in spanish. It will give you English sentences or phrases for the various connotations of the word ""flat"" and it will have the spanish translation for each of the English connotations! This is great becaus you'll know that your getting the right Spanish word for the concept you want to convey."
1,terrible,"this book was way too techincial. i could barely understand it and i am a full fledged figure skater! yup, i even skate 5 days a week, and this book is a big bore even for me. the author seemed to think tara was perfect but michelle was a clunky old wanna be. AS IF! Go Michelle! I am your biggest fan!"
3,If You Like Both Tara and Michelle....,"...as I do, this book would make a fair addition to your skating collection. The book was not bad -- it was an interesting read, but it didn't really tell me much that I didn't already know about both skaters. Tara and Michelle's individual autobiographies give you a far better look into their lives and their emotions throughout the especially eventful 1996-1997 skating season. The photos were good and it was a good overview of both skaters and their careers, but if you want the real story of these skaters as well, you should definitely pick up Triumph on Ice and Heart of a Champion to get the whole story."
3,This book was a good book if you want to be an ice skater.,I think you should read this book because it's great .If you want to know about Michell Kwan and Tara Lipinski. It's not too hard to read . It could take you one to two weeks.
3,about those comments between the songs...,"Great songs if you're into such dramatic stuff --- and her voice was truly unique and beautiful. The comments between each song, and often overlapping the beginning of a song are sure to irritate quite a few people, though. I have a couple of cd's that do this --- and it drives me nuts. Interesting once, sure, but after that --- argh!"
4,Relaxed...not meant for the charts.,"This CD was not exactly ""Beatles-inspired"" as it claims to be. If you're a fan of Paul's musical genius, you might be a bit disappointed. However, as the other cd-raters wrote, he was taking it easy and just writing happy-thoughts. No pop-chart-worthy tracks, but still an excellent listening pleasure.PAUL IS STILL GEAR AND FAB!"
3,Not bad,"I'd been trying to by this cd for years. I knew many of the songs but I couldn't figure out what cd they belonged to. Well, I found it at amazon and I finally bought it.It was quick and easy and the package arrived right on time. My favorite song is Calico skies but the cd is not bad.I'm happy with my purchase."
4,Brilliant with only a few weaknesses,"Don't be fooled by the 4-star rating. This album is full of some of McCartney's best songs. If Paul could have weeded out the two or three clunkers on Flaming Pie, this might just be a perfect collection. ""The Song We Were Singing"" is beautiful and enjoyable, although it does grow tiring upon repeated listenings. ""The World Tonight"" and ""If You Wanna"" are ones to hear over and over. ""Somedays"" is my personal favorite song on this collection. It is beautiful and touching yet also haunting in a way. The second half of the CD is not as strong, but songs such as ""Beautiful Night"" and ""Young Boy"", as well as a couple of others, are top-notch. Overall, this is a great buy."
3,Good,"A good record that would have been better had McCartney hired a real drummer for the sessions. Ringo would have played much better than did Paul, and the songs needed a harder driving drum beat.That said, some very good melodies, and some weak songs. I particularly like ""Souvenir,"" ""Used To Be Bad,"" ""Heaven On A Sunday,"" ""Little Willow,"" and ""Beautiful Night."" I also liked the finale, ""Great Day,"" with Linda's harmony blending in quite nicely.The biggest clunker is the first tune, ""The Song We Were Singing."" Too slow, cumbersome, and tiring. ""Somedays"" is the same, boring and methodical.Overall, a good listen, but uneven, like most of his solo work. What Paul needs the most, as George Harrison has often said, is someone who will tell him when his material isn't any good. He has enough GOOD songs, but just needs to weed out the bad ones. Lennon used to fill this role while with the Beatles, and visa versa."
4,A return to form.,"IMHO , this is -- by far -- PM ' s best solo work since ""Band on the Run"". Beatlelesque in sound , this is truly a return to form that will be most welcome by both old and new fans ."
3,"It's good, but he's done better","When 'Flaming Pie' was released in 1997, it was hailed as his best ever solo album. However, I feel that work such as 'Off The Ground' from 1993 and 'Flowers In The Dirt' from 1989 are superior. There is some nice stuff on 'Flaming Pie', such as 'Beautiful Night', but the fact that that song dates back to 1986 tells a lot. I LOVE Macca, but if I had to reccomend one album of his to someone, this wouldn't be it."
3,Pretty Good,"I like Calico Skies and some of the slower tempo songs. When I listen to ""Little Willow,"" my hope is that Paul will heed his own advice."
2,Overrated,"I understand wanting to like anything new by Paul. But really five stars for this???? I gave it two just because he is McCartney and I'm a big fan..but really almost all of this is trite and not among his best work. Little Willow, Young Boy being the exceptions. To check out some of his best, look to: McCartney, Band on the Run even Back to the Egg. Still, it's too early to write the man off just yet. Run Devil Run was his best album in years."
3,"Calico Skies- great, the rest is a half-baked pie","McCartney has only written a few decent songs in the last thirty years, but on this album is his best in that span, ""Calico Skies,"" a true classic. The rest of the album is over-rated although a few like ""Song We were Singing"" and ""Beautiful Night"" are listenable. Don't believe all the five-star ratings and the gushing about this album- McCartney fans are just enraptured that he actually has a few songs on the album worth listening to- from anyone else, it would be a three-star album at best. One great song, a few good ones, but over half are not that good and very forgettable. For a McCartney album, it's better than most, but as most of us know, that's not saying much."
4,Water Color McCartney,"An oddly moody album, coming from the man everyone loves to chide for his inate good humor, FLAMING PIE finds McCartney in a contemplative mood, looking back and a bit worried about the future.There are more colors and tones here than on any Macca LP since LONDON TOWN, and La Big Mac hits on most cylinders. ""Somedays,"" ""Young Boy,"" ""Beaufiful Night"" are wonderful tracks, and there's plenty of fine stuff here.""Calico Sky"" and ""Little Willow"" are my favorite 'soft' McCartney tracks in a long, long time. I've heard he wrote ""Calico Sky"" for Linda, but it makes me wish Macca would do a kids LP, nothing but the sweet lullabyes he does so well.FLAMING PIE doesn't quite meet the standards of MCCARTNEY or BAND ON THE RUN, but it stands with VENUS & MARS, SPEED OF SOUND, TUG OF WAR and others as a 2nd-Tier McCartney record, which is to say it's top flight."
4,"An excellent, heartfelt return to real pop","While I have to admit to being such a Beatles fan that I'm predisposed to buy a lot of solo ex-Beatle music, I also have to admit that I've been disappointed with a lot of it, and probably with Paul's more than the rest. Each album has a gem or two, or possibly several, but few of Paul's solo efforts are great as a whole. ""Flaming Pie"" ranks up there with ""McCartney"", ""Band on the Run"", and perhaps as someone else mentioned, ""Flowers in the Dirt"". It has a more honest, sincere, down- to-earth feel than many of his solo CD's, coupled with a more spare sound. The addition of Ringo (particularly on the coda to ""Beautiful Night""), Steve Miller and Jeff Lynne all add spice to this Pie, but Paul's still the chef, and this is puts him back on the menu."
5,Paul McCartney Flaming Pie CD,Super fast delivery and excellent product (I misplaced my original copy and had to get another). The CD was everything I expected and more! Thanks again for enhancing my music collection!!!
4,Good,"There is the inveitable dead weight that comes from just messing about, but for the most part Paul is offering up some remarkably good tunes here, simply and clearly produced, at times masterful, and always fun. ""Young Boy"" is a particular hit. Liner notes by Mark Lewisohn are so detailed you'd think this was a reissue of an old classic."
4,Flaming Good,"This is one of McCartney's best of many very good albums. Especially moving is the ballad, Somedays, but every song is pretty damn good. George Martin was brought on to produce some of these songs, and his influence shows (as in Somedays). Also, Paul does a song with Ringo Starr, the only McCartney-Starr collobaration.Sparkling good show!"
5,GREAT DANCE MIX BY BRAXTON....,"IF YOU WANT A GOOD DANCE MIX..CHECK THIS ONE OUT...THIS SONG /MIXES BY FRANKIE KNUCKLES & SOUL SOLUTION IS FULL OF ENERGY..HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VERSION OF THE MULTI-PLATINUM #1 DANCE HIT ""UN-BREAK MY HEART""ALSO RECOMMEND--MARIAH CAREY-(DREAMLOVER & MY ALL)--- WHITNEY HOUSTON ""HEARTBREAK HOTEL/IT'S NOT RIGHT BUT IT'S OKAY(DANCE MIX)& DEBORAH COX(NOBODY'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE-DANCE MIXES-THAT WILL KEEP YOU DANCING ALL NIGHT!"
3,"I LOVE YOU KEL, BUT THIS MOVIE COULD OF BEEN BETTER......","I THINK THIS MOVIE WAS JUST ALRIGHT. KEL WAS FUNNY IN SOME SCENES BUT HE SHOULD BE MORE DOWN TO EARTH WITH HIS COMEDY.I LIKE THE TOPIC OF THIS MOVIE BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN GET ROBBED IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE AND BETTER ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE TO MAKE IT MORE LIVELY. ALSO,I LIKE THAT THEY GOT THE TWO BOYS FROM THE PARKERS,THE GUY THAT PLAYED IN FRIDAY AND FREDRO STARR WAS ALRIGHT. THE GIRL THAT PLAYED KENNEDY ROSS THAT ROBBED RICKY BARRY(KEL) CAN'T ACT AT ALL IN THIS MOVIE.OVERALL, I STILL LOVE KEL AND I STILL THINK HE HAS THE ABILITY TO BE FUNNY AS HELL. I HOPE HE'LL STAR OR BE IN A MOVIE THAT'S NOT LOW BUDGET."
3,WASTED MY MONEY,"DUMB and why they called this movie GANKED, was dumb. It only appeared once.Wish I'd save my money. It's not what they reviewers said, and not funny."
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!,"Two things should have warned me this movie was goingto be horrible.Kel Mitchell was in it,and after ""GoodBurger"" everything he does should be discounted,andhe wrote it.That should have been a dead giveaway.It's boring,stupid and completely unfunny.Thecharacters are amazing in their stupidity.Havingone guy who opens the door complaining all the time,the girl that they fawn over is an ass-&$le andthat Money Mike guy from ""Friday after Next"" keepspullin a Katie Holmes and ""acts"" the same way inevery movie he's in regardless of the character.Which means he can't act.He's a worse actor thanHeather Graham and that's saying alot.Buy this movie only if you would like tosee how well a DVD can burn,cause thats allyou should do with it."
1,Real Generic Film,"I watched this Film over the weekend&I always dug Kel's stuff from back in the day,but this Film was Madd Corny.Kennedy Ross was a Stuff Chick,but Vocally if You were Drunk that voice of Her's would Sober you up because your Ears would Be Ringing.Kennedy Ross was Stacked like a GreyHound Bus,but Vocally she came off like a Crusty Cheese Bus.it had a couple of laughs&Helped Me Snore real well that Night."
1,Do not buy from Cutters!,"WARNING! DON'T ORDER FROM CUTTERS!Unfortunately, I had to give this one star in order to post review.I ordered this from Cutters through Amazon. When I received the box, over half the items were missing. I contacted Cutters and never received the courtesy of a reply. Not even a ""canned"" response saying they'll look into the matter.At a cost close to $300, thank goodness for the Amazon A-Z guarantee. Amazon refunded my money after filing a claim against Cutters.I cannot review the products themselves, as I never received them.I do have other Donna Dewberry One Stroke products and enjoy them."
2,Sometimes it was alright....,"Well it started off like all the rest( and I mean that) and then it got into some really bad stuff, I usually like spoofs but this one is just plain bad! Tom Arnold is in this movie and he's not that exciting. sorry about the yuckie review but it's the truth.."
2,Cool Cheap Laughs here&there,this is a Cool Parity type of film.it isn't a film you are gonna want to watch alot but it has a Alright early to Mid-80's Teen Comedy feel.it has some ok moments.
1,One star for effort,"When you attempted to do a spoof of a spoof, you are signing your own death warrant.Shriek If You Know What I did Last Friday the 13th is spoof ofScary movie which is a Spoof of Scream and I Know What You did Last Summer.The only thing i found close to being funny were the silly pop ups toward the end of the movie, other then that the writers for this film obliviously didn't have the talent for writing comedy, they probably use the jokes that the Wayne's Brothers rejected. The dialog is rotten, and the stupidity of the some of the other characters is no where near humor level in Scary Movie.Stick with Scary, avoid this movie like the plague unless you are a film student or a film maker looking for examples of bad movies."
4,another HALARIOUS scream spoof but this time..........,"This movie was very funny. It was very stupid too. This time Tom Arnold and coolio is in this and even though it is almost the same plot as ""Scary Movie"" it is still worth watching. The acting and directing is quite good.If your a satire fan you will definetly love "" Shriek if you know what i did last Friday the 13th""."
4,No more salt lick,"People dont get the fact that this film isnt meant to be taken seriously, not even as a parody. There are some really stupid things/lines that happen. Take the sex ed scene. This wierd teacher gets two sock puppets out then pretends that they are making out with each other!'i always rely on the kindness of strangers!''kiss my stranger'It doesnt even make sense but makes me and my friends laugh everytime. The attention to detail is pretty good despite the surreal nature. Dooey's last name in this one is prime suspect.The main character is called Dawson Deary (cotton leary anyone?) and even the most miniscule detail like the camera man at the end being a black guy makes this the best parody of Scream yet.Its not just scream it parodies either. There are definite references to scream if you know what i did last summer, among other filmsIn conclusion if youve got quite a base sense of humour this one isnt for you"
3,I'm never gonna get laid!,"one thing I liked about this movie was that it spoofed older movies like Friday the 13 and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, even though it's not a hororr movie. And when Dawson asks who Spacey is because he seems familer, that was nice. But some parts of the films dragged. while I saw Scary Movie more than a couple of times and still laugh out loud. So, nowhere being AS good as Scary Movie, but still worth the laughs."
1,WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU FIVE STAR PEOPLE?,"It's not a scarymovie, this comedy still sucks. It's not really even funny, the Comedy is a zero...and the characters are crappy ones...the one who don't know how to act. And even when the killer tries to be funny, he's dumb...Take this from a ten year old, this movie is a stupid comedy of a scarymovie..."
3,Stick with Scary Movie if you want a good Scream spoof.,"...a spoof about the Scream trilogy, more than likely inspired by ""Scary Movie."" ...I...was not impressed. Sure, it had it's laughs (I personally thought the Sex Ed. part was funny), but it wasn't anything. I didn't cry like I did when I saw ""Scary Movie"". It's about the same thing as you know what is, a clumsy, idiotic killer attacking high school students, while busting his [rear] to do it. Don't buy this, just rent it."
2,About what I expected,"If you enjoyed Scary Movie then you might like this one as well. But unlike Scary Movie where I thought much of it was funny,this one has only a few moments to laugh at. The Pop Up video part of the film was pretty good, but overall I sat through this one just like it was something on cable."
1,seems like scary movie,"i wonder if this is a rip off of a rip off well, it is and its pretty bad to beat and not funny at all"
4,I know what I did last Friday night: watched this movie,"I thought ""Shriek..."" was hilarious. THIS is the movie I had expected the disappointing ""Scary Movie"" to be. ""Shriek"" is an excellent parody, right up there with ""Hot Shots"" and ""Airplane."" A real hoot!"
3,you know what i did,"Scary movie was so much better than this in every way possiable, for one it had way more laughs. There are good moments in the film yes. I did laugh here and there. The boy wanting to get laid, the hot girl, the supposed lesbian girl and gay guy, and of course the stupid guy. This film is basically a parody of a parody. I do like the movie for some reason though it's nothing i'll beg people to see."
3,Poor acting brings down this funny flim!,"Shriek is one hell of a funny movie. it has everything like ""child's play"" to ""american pie"". its stars Coolio as the Principal"", former saved by the bell star Tiffani-amber thiessan and a cast of no named teenagers. The Only problem that Shriek has is the HORRIBLE acting. Even though it was made for TV it should have at least attemped to do a good job. SO give Shriek a try and only that. Scary Movie had a story this doesn't. It is very funny but after a while it gets oldShriek If you know what I did last Friday the 13:C-"
3,AIRPLANE MEETS JASON,"Shirley Jones as the school's suppressed nurse; Rose Marie as a sadistic teacher; and Tom Arnold as a bisexual guard. Who could ask for more? This movie is very funny and entertaining. Like AIRPLANE, you have to watch things going on behind the main actors, and listen to the PA announcements. They are hilarious.It's good natured and not as sexily crude and redundant as the Scary Movie series. It is preposterous and slap stick humor and it's done well.HAVE FUN AND LAUGH."
4,Pretty Good,"I first saw this movie on the USA Network. I wondered why I can't find this in any video store, but I think now I understand. Based on the reviews I think people would brake it, and the company would lose money. The movie isn't as bad as people say it is. It was sort of like it was copying Scary Movie, so that brought down my rating. Scary Movie, to me gets 5 stars, so go see Scary Movie instead. Or, better yet, see both, but you will probably like Scary Movie the best."
1,I know this is going to be bad,"Man, what a rip off! They basically steal the original working title for ""Scary Movie"", which was originally going to be ""Scream if you know what I did last summer"" -- this whole movie is a ripoff -- ""Oh, let's re-hash parodies of popular horror flicks, much like that other movie, what's that called again? Scary Movie? Only we're not going to be as funny this time around!""This is just a lame TV version of Scary Movie meant to catch up on all the hype its better created -- a wannabe filled with has-been stars (Coolio? What the heck's up with that? I thought he was dead...)"
1,"It's No "" SCARY MOVIE 1 or 2 "" !!",I bought this move on DVD after reading the reviews on here - it's so difficult to say in a few paragraphs what makes this such a poor movie - certainly no where near as good as the two Scary Movies - this movie was poorly acted / fragmented story / NOT FUNNY at all / tedious ........Even the character updates at the end of the credits made no sense and were not funny - AVOID this one if you have a sense of humour !
1,Makes me yawn.....,"who can enjoy a movie like this, at first i was tired when i watched it, a few months later one of my friends had rented it and called me over, i gave the movie a second chance, it is the worst comedy i have seen in my life, there is nothing funny about this movie, it just bores everyone to death, if i had seen this in the theatre, i would have just walked out, this movie is not worth the disc it is recorded on, if i had actually bought this title, i would be too humiliated to take it back and ask for a refund, it is such a crap movie and does not even deserve to have any copies of it made, after all it's only wasting good discs.Another thing, it has a stupid intro and is too similar to scary movie's (wich is a good film) and this film makes me feel that i'd be better wathing static for the rest of my life."
1,O.E.M.?,"Seemed like a decent pickup coil but ran into flow problems when I used it. The OEM is says on the box stands for Original Equipment Management, which who the hell knows what that means lol."
3,hot dance and club tracks...EDITED!,"This volume of the series that could've but didn't includes huge club names like Bardeaux, Technotronic, Frankie Knuckles, and Club 69...and proceeds to use only 56 minutes of the CD to give us just about all radio edits! Blah. Some of these tracks are near impossible to get on CD--they should have been the club versions!!! a hot male model on the cover is not enough to make this CD a hit. Track times:1. affection (4:37)2. gonna catch you (3:46)3. move this (3:39)4. sugar pie guy (4:34)5. too many fish (5:32)6. don't you want my love (4:57)7. i wish you would (5:28)8. i love to bass (5:16)9. hold on to what you've got (5:58)10. let it slide (4:08)11. history (3:50)12. restless moods (4:27)"
5,LV is so far the best Japanese TV series,LV is so far the best Japanese TV series and one of the reason for its success is its music. This is just a great CD.Anyone who has or has not watch LV should own it ! It worths your money.
5,another winner,"Although slow at times, THE LORDS OF THE WHITE CASTLE,provides entertaining reading as well as a strong historical basis. Warning: it is yet again one of Chadwick's books where the hero and heroine are separated for a large part of the book. But the fact that it's based on real people and it provides interesting insights into other historical figures makes it a winner. I really LIKED the major characters and the book is just so well written."
3,Good - but certainly not the best out there,"I'll keep this short as I am a reader not a writer :). I recently finished 'Lords of the White Castle'. It is an OK book, not more then that.The characters were too flat for my liking.If you enjoy reading about 12-13th century and are not intimidated by 600+ pages then try Sharon Key Penman books(which I would rate 5 stars):1101-1154 When Christ And His Saints Slept (Vol 1 of Trilogy)1156-1171 Time And Space (Vol 2 of Trilogy)12th Cent Devil's Brood (Vol 3 of Trilogy)1192-1193 The Queen's Man1193 Cruel As The Grave1183-1232 Here Be Dragons (Vol 1 of Welsh Trilogy)1231-1267 Falls The Shadow (Vol 2 of Welsh Trilogy)1271-1283 The Reckoning (Vol 3 of Welsh Trilogy)1459-1492 The Sunne In SplendourI hope you find this (short) review helpful."
1,Robbing from the rich and .....keeping it all to herself,"I can not review this book because I will never be able to afford to buy and read it.The author should be ashamed of herself. She writes a story about a man that rebels against the rich and entitled and yet she attempts to 'fleece' her richer readers, leaving folks like myself unable to participate. If that is not class separation, I do not know what is.She should take a page from her own book (the expensive one) and be a person of generous spirit, like Fulk Fitzwarin and his lovely wife Maude Le Vavasour, my 27th Great Grandmother, and price this like her other books so that everyone EVERYONE can have access to them."
4,Medieval England Brought to Life,"Elizabeth Chadwick has mastered the technique of cramming her books with historically accurate facts and making the story interesting at the same time.This book revolves around the hatred of two men for one another, Prince John of England and a young knight named Fulke. The gnawing anger and hatred begins when both men are in their late teens. Fulke is a squire in the household of Prince John and the tempers of both men cause them to draw blood on one another.It is a hatred that can never be doused and is the main thread running throughout the book. Based on fact, the story is both exciting and dramatic and for those interested in this period of history is a must read."
1,Disappointing CD,"I assumed that the cd would contain ALL misic from the series, unfortunatly they included dialogue from the series which in my opinion detracts for the content of the disc."
2,Expected more good bluegrass music,I expected more bluegrass style music. I was disappointed with the selection of music provided. Two tracks are excellent though: the theme from Deadwood and Igauzu. Igauzu alone is worth half the price. It is brilliant.
5,You'll like it,"Great show, great music. The addition of several snippets of dialogue was a bonus. The music is a very good pick of some of the tunes on the show. The dialogue clips will make you laugh. Just don't play it in front of the kids. But if you watched the show, you already know that.Now, let's get season two on DVD. I'm overseas and will never get this show on the American Forces Network!"
3,"Decent Music, Great Sound Clips","I was referred to this soundtrack by a friend who knew I was looking for obscure, old-timey American music. Though I'm not a fan of ""Deadwood"", some of the music was quite fetching. Also included on this soundtrack are sound clips from the series which, while they are quite vulgar, are also very humorous to me, even out of context. I'm sure ""Deadwood"" enthusiasts would love this album, and fans of old-timey American music should be satisfied as well."
1,Opera Babes New Album Unavailable Except for a High Price,"I would LOVE to have this album, but its not available in iTunes, so I logically come to Amazon. They will have their new album right? But its $99.00! Are you kidding me? Why is it so hard to get new British/European music quickly and for a reasonable price on this website?? The ""used"" copies are starting at $26.00! When albums are going for $9.99 in most places, why does Amazon try to rip us off? I have been waiting for this new album for a while, and now I can't afford it! Get with it, Amazon and iTunes, not all the music people want is Beyonce. This deserves to be offered at a fair price to the American consumer."
3,Alice Playten's Star Turn,"Most of the performers struggle in vain againt the inane lyrics in this flop musical. The star turn that makes the CD worth listening to is Alice Playten belting out ""Nobody Steps On Kafritz."" Alice Playten playing the supporting role of villaness Lillian Kafritz was the highlight of the show and also makes the best of her second act number, ""Poor Little Person."""
4,A Life in Balance,"Dr. Bob taught our management and sales team how to juggle. We had fun learning the juggling art, but also learnt the analogy - keep your life in balance. After learning the basic juggling skill, I read the book, and was able because of it's cartoon illustrations to easily improve my skill level while at the same time adding new tricks to my repertoire! A great tool for both one's personal and business life! - Issy N."
2,Juggling book repoff,We expected to receive the juggling cubes that were offered along with the book and were unable to contact anyone to complain. Not a happy camper and also disappointed granddaughter for her Christmas gift.
1,2 strikes & your out,"The title promises a lot, instant juggling with new and improved juggling cubes. I returned both orders of this because the cubes never came with it."
4,It works!,I looked hard for a PCMCIA card that supports Win98. I installed it on an old Toshiba CDS25. I worked right out of the box (after installing a driver). Now I have an adequate wireless internet terminal.
3,Pet Shop Boys - Can You Forgive Her?,"Fun club mixes of the Pet Shop Boys' CAN YOU FORGIVE HER?, another story of forbidden love and social stigma. But with a disco beat! Rollo makes great use of the ""dance to disco"" vocal sample in the original in two groovy (though essentially identical) mixes. MK keeps things rolling with a smooth and cool synth line before leading into his (at the time) unique cut-up-and-rearranged sampling. The dub focuses on more on the word ""pain"" (and, oddly, ""bicycle"") but has some lovely organ chords to keep the house kicking. Johnny Marr, better known as a guitarist, does an okay job at mixing, but his version of ""I Want to Wake Up"" is not quite ready for the clubs, I'm afraid..."
3,A CONFUSING MIX,this was a mix of good and bad.the verses sounded horrible but i loved the chorus!him could do better but still this is not one to pass up!
1,The book should be re-titled,"With the cost of over $60 and having a book that can cover so shallow is a 'rip off'. I think the book should be re-titled as `Idiots for Internet Security'. Even the books from IDG Idiot Series cover more in depth than this one. I spent 5 minutes and dropped this book to the bottom of the shelf. Most titles have a discussion of less than a page and some of them are not even relevant - such as `atomicity'. To be fair, the book should having a warning sign- `Strictly for non technical people'."
4,Great book for multi national CIO's,Mainly concentrates on the global aspect of Network Security issues. Very good for people writitng policies for the enterprise. Helps CIO's to get a perspective on what could go wrong in their geographically scattered network and provides insights into how to address those issues.
2,"Nice pen, but doesn't work on my tablet",Im searching high and low for a pen to replace my HP Slate 500 pen and this one did not do that. It still feels nice to hold but doesn't work on the HP Slate 500.
5,Very Thorough Collection From Holland,"Singles + is a comprehensive review of Sonny & Cher's output from the beginning of their marriage/professional partnership until their divorce in 1974. Collectors of singles and chart hits like myself love compilations like these because *every* song that hit Billboard's Hot 100 by either Sonny & Cher or Cher as a solo artist through 1974 is included here. Granted, one must look elswhere to find Cher's solo outings after 1974, but I suppose the point of the set is to represent recordings during their years as a married couple. Arbitrary cutoff point, perhaps, but, oh well.One point I'd like to clarify from Ward Lamb's otherwise excellent review below. He mentions a less than perfect sonic rating for this set. I'm not familiar with these ratings or standards, but to the extent one infers that the sound quality of this collection is substandard, never fear, the songs sound great. Perhaps not audiophile quality, but any casual listener will be more than satisfied."
3,Sound Quality Not Up to Par,"A wonderful collection with songs you will not find in other sets. With available technology that that can make recordings from the 1920's and 30's sound clear and fresh, this was a real disappointment. That said, I would still buy the CD. Just don't pay the full retail price!"
5,Fantastic New Groove,"Dove by Moony is an amazing track. It's a fresh new tune that inspires the mind, body and soul. When you hear it - you can't help but being transported to another place - if only for a moment - where life is a party on the French Riviera (take a look at the video - you'll understand). This track promises to be the dance hit of the summer. No collection is complete without it!"
2,Music,The Cd itself is a great cd and in good condition but took longer than suppose to.. Even emailed the seller about the item and was adv I would get it last week and just got it this week which is 2 weeks past the original due date..
3,"Ordered two, recieved different bars.","I really don't have much of a problem with the two that I ordered, but one of them was shorter than the other, which posed something of a problem.If I could assure that my next purchase would be correct in size, then I would give it one more star."
2,Avoid at all cost if you are taking world history,"I used this prep book to prepare for SAT II World HistoryIt proudly states that most part of the test is concentrated on European History.Yes, it is true.However, it basically does nothing to cover the rest part of the world.And even for the European History, it just barely touches the surface that you get nothing out of it after the review chapter.Compare the thickness of this book (which also has US History and two practice for US History) and other World History prep books.It's way too thin physically, and in content.Although other prep books may have too much extra information. However, too much is always better than too little.I am not giving 1 star just because I haven't had chance to check out the US History section."
4,It's Good idea learn by Internet,This Book cover all of the methodology to create Virtual learning sites for Universities and Schools for the new era of education.
3,Basic country comp from the 70s,"Though having to be relegated to ""budget"" status by virtue of its stingy ten tracks, this collection of hit country tunes from the 70's does provide a decent sampling of the music of the era.These are mostly well-known tracks with many of them having made noise on the pop charts as well with one, Sammi Smith's ""Help Me Make It Through The Night"" invading the pop top-10. The repertoire does represent an eclectic mix of country tunes with the likes of Ray Stevens' countrified pop chestnut ""Misty"", ""Big Four Poster Bed"" by 60's female pop icon Brenda Lee, a hit from her country era, and one of the most clever plays-on-words in a title, the Bellamy Brothers' ""If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me"".With competent sound quality and at least a brief commentary on the included tracks in the liner notes booklet, this piece does offer an interesting and well-executed, if brief, tour of the country hits of the decade."
2,"Watch I wanted not in stock, but nice sellers.","Unfortunately, the watch I wanted was not in stock. The watch I received was not the watch I wanted. The sellers were unaware that it wasn't the watch. I wanted the one with a larger expansion band, but received the regular expansion band watch. I returned the watch to them, and they refunded me without any problem. They were very pleasant to deal with."
3,Good watch for a good price,"I purchased this watch for my wife as a Christmas present. I waited until the last moment, but it still arrived in time for Christmas. The only problem I had was the band did not expand to fit my wife's wrist and she spent as much on a new band as the watch cost."
3,but,"it was a good book but... i would have enjoyed more instructive format. however, the anecdotes and analogies make it interesting. it was literally a quick read."
1,Irrelevant,"I found many of the basic principals of this booked flawed.The internet branding portion is almost completely irrelevant, given what happened in the past few years."
1,Marketing for Idiots,Simply put this book sucks. The examples are out of date and can only be applied to a mature company being run by brian dead drones.Don't waste your money.
4,Something to think about,This is a book giving very clear examples of the smart and not smart way of branding. Very useful to look at every now and then not to make the same mistakes again.
3,"The book is a 3, but the audio is a 0","This book was recommended to my by a friend, but instead of the book, I bought the audio. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. The author may be a good writer, but he is NOT a good ""reader"", and neither is his wife. It was so distracting that it eliminated anything positive the book may have offered."
1,"The 1 Immutable Law of Discreditation, Prognosticate","I think the Ries' got a little big in the britches, my favorite, ""The PC, the Internet, and the Television set will combine? It will never happen, technologies don't converge. They diverge."" or paraphrased ""Who in the world wants to have their palm pilot, telephone, and CD player all in one?"" LOL Oops, as I do this review on my smart phone while listening to Pandora. Completely discredits the rest of his ""I am the smartest person in the world"" crap. Save your money."
2,Mutable,"I bought this book because it was recommended by Fred DeLuca, co-founder of Subway, as well as many of the reviewers here in Amazon. I do not quite share their enthusiasm.If you are not already a devout believer in the all-encompassing power of branding you will probably NOT be convinced of it by reading this book. Every ""law"" mentioned in this book is backed by nothing more than generalizations and countless non sequiturs. With some real analysis, I would not be surprised if some of these ""laws"" were proven to be partially or entirely false.There are some interesting ideas presented, but I do not think that is enough to recommend this book. If you do read it, make sure you take the ""laws"" with a grain of salt."
4,Lots of good info and points made. Feels a bit dated with 2013 a month away,"Enjoyable read. Much has changed in the 10 years since original printing, yet most principles still apply. I would recommend this to anyone looking to help their brand succeed."
3,"Good, but please! don't expect nirvana","I can't believe some of these other reviews. Some guy gave it 5 stars and admitted that he hadn't read it yet! I assume that isn't a plant, because it's too stupid to be a plant.The book is good, thought-provoking, and has some real insights. HOWEVER, it is a little simplistic, and it's written for the brand manager of Coke. For those of us without 80+ years of brand history behind us yet, some of his advice isn't relevant. Also, some of his conclusions are just too simplistic: ""Symbols are overrated and don't matter much anyway"" (paraphrasing). Come on. You can't tell me the swoosh isn't a powerful asset, and the authors admit it, but they poo-poo the entire concept.Section on naming is very insightful. And the hard advice on expansion is right on! Overall, good, and worth buying for any marketing person. But, this is definitely NOT the bible. Come on, people!"
4,Good book~!,"It is a useful book. The reason I gave it a 4-star b/c it could probably shorten the length of each chapter by cut down the time he/she spent on the repeating the same idea. Otherwise, i'm very happy about reading the book."
5,Short and effective,"The best thing about this book is the short chapters: it isn't some unweildly volume that will gather dust on the shelf. It's a resource to re-visit, re-read and bring more fresh thoughts to mind. Whilst the 'laws' are integrated, and you'll find references in some chapters to other 'laws' in the book, you don't have to read it cover-to-cover every time you pick it up. Having said that, you could do so in a spare afternoon! Worth keeping close to hand."
3,Great if you skip laws 16 and 17,Almost all of what he wrote is very useful and good. He doesn't know what he is talking about when he talks about laws 16 and 17: The law of the shape referring to symbols and logos and the law of color.It seems that many of the other laws could be condensed in one or two laws about focusing on narrowing the scope and category of your brand.
3,Taking branding seriously,"I've been branding for most of my life. It's an intrinsic and essential feature of my profession. I thought I knew pretty much all there was to know - that is, until I saw this book. It claims to cover everything, and I must admit even I would be hard pressed to come up with 22 laws. Personally, I find some of the concepts apparently introduced in this book a bit far-fetched; I can't imagine how an idea like ""branding people's minds"" could be put into practice, nor, indeed, why you would want to. And as for ""branding over the internet"", well, to me that's just pure science fiction. Branding is a fairly personal thing, though, and everyone has their own tricks and techniques. I applaud the author for treating it as a serious enough subject to warrant an entire book."
1,dated and narrow,"This book is more about Ries point of view than any ""immutable"" laws I'm aware of. While well expressed these views seem to make an imbalanced and narrow assessment of how things work in the world. The book minimized the value of advertising, and the role of design in branding so much that it's not very useful for someone who is actually in branding. It may have more appropriately been called, an approach to doing business by someone who likes Coca Cola. Someone who wants to develop a sales strategy for a global product line might read it... I just didn't find it practical, especially since it's rather dated now, and a lot of the claims have been proved wrong by events since 2003."
2,Pathetic attempt on using brands to sell a book,"This is a father and daugther book that in fact tries to use the brand of The 22 Immutable Laws of Mrketing (in itself an excellent book) by the father and Trout. Unfortunately, they manage to sell this book, because they use this branding (title, cover, structure, the Reis name) to suggest that it is as good and revolutionary as the original. Unfortunately, it is neither. There exists a number of good books on the market what regards branding, this is not one of them. But you have to admire their use of branding in selling the book to an unsuspecting public, even though I find it morally questionable."
1,#1 Book of 2011?,"It was written in 2002 need I say more. Things have come a long way since then. Unless you are a big company developing a brand to compete on a level like Coke, Pepsi, McDonalds, etc. Save you self the time and get a different book"
5,must have for business owners,As a small business owner and someone who was new to the business side of running a business I have found this book an absolute necessity in my daily business life.
5,Great Classic that never ages!,"I believe Al Reis is one of the most important contributors to the principles of marketing as we know. I read this book and his other book about Laws of Marketing years ago. I still think the ideas in these books are timeless. I still browse them from time to time to refresh my memory. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to be a businessman or successful in their careers. I believe it is a neccessity to learn about the principles of branding and marketing in today's business world wether you are in marketing, advertising or finance. Easy to read, great to learn."
3,Shoul dbe 22 sometimes laws of branding...,"Good for branding basics, but once it dives into the ""new world of the Internet"" it stops being useful basically because every prediction they have about Internet companies and the mistakes they are making turn out to be wrong. The fact that you're looking at this review proves 1 prediction wrong, they predicted Amazon would die because it's straying from it's branding by expanding beyond books (its brand). They spend a lot of time talking how none of the old rules apply to the Internet, then they spend the rest of the book doing just that, applying the old rules to the Internet, and you can see just how wrong they were. That being said a lot of information can be learned about real world branding, and by seeing where they were wrong you can also deduce information about online branding."
3,General information light reading,"I think the book is beneficial, but felt the information was stretched in presentation to warrant a ""book."" Plenty of blank space on pages for notes or doodles. I expected fresher case studies in higher quantities."
1,they chose THAT guy to sing? ouch.,Interesting take on some good tunes. Decent guitar work. The vocals will make you never drop this disc into the player again. Think I'll release my own.
1,Please release this without the vocal track,I started with 46 & 2 and was very impressed with the musical arrangement...I assumed they would not even add vocals because really..just about anyone is going to be compared with maynard and instantly be found lacking.HOWEVER...a monkey with a hammer applied to his tail would do a better vocal performance than this guy. Pleas mix yourself out of the track and let me record my voice over it which I guarantee you hands down would be 5000% better than this.Thank You.
1,"Great acoustic guitar, horrible vocals","The guitarwork is great! However, the vocals are so mismatched with this style of music, that the CD is pretty much unbearable. Dont think I'll ever listen to it again."
3,Would have been 5 stars without the crappy vocals....,"Seriously, this would have been SO awesome if it had just been an instrumental.The guitar work is sick and the songs really lend themselves to this, surprisingly.But the vocals just RUIN the whole thing and make it sound like a bad local cover band. The guys not awful, but he's not good either and certainly not Maynard and the instrumentals are 5 stars if it had been sans vocals.Too bad. Maybe they can re-release just the instrumentals."
1,Are you serious?,"The instrumentals are good, sometimes great, but the singers' voices ruin this. Any good review has to be a planted review from the seller. TOOL meets washed up lounge singer with throat cancer at best."
2,lower your expectations,"this album sounds like Perry Ferrel (janes addiction) is singing over a rough interpretation of tool. Crawl Away is the best on the album, but only because the others are sao bad. Tool CAN NOT be immitated. Please stop buying tributes that do no justice to the band (that means every tribute except the string quartet tributes), unless of course if you expect to be let down and dont really care to experience the intensity that is Tool, then buy this album."
2,"""Why is the film veering off?""","To start off, I've never been a fan of the Child's Play films anyways. But besides the point, I saw this film a few days ago- what the heck is this?????When did Child's Play become a comedy? There is nothing scary at all in this film anymore. Back when Chucky was out hunting for Andy- it was scary, now it is just a waste. Sure, I laughed a lot, but is that what this film was meant for?Another point- After Chucky and Tiffany did ""their thing"" (how is that possible for plastic dolls???), how could the Tiffany doll produce a baby in less that a day??? STRANGE.The acting wreaked- (the human people), and even the visual effects sucked. From Chucky crawling on the sidewalk, to Jennifer Tilly getting electricuted in the bathtub- it was all bad.The only stars for this film go to how stupidly funny it was, and Chucky's voice.""Hi, I'm Chucky... I wouldn't see this if I were you."""
3,"Stupid, but still somewhat enjoyable.","Okay, Okay, so Bride of Chucky is a load of crap. But I still found it somewhat enjoyable.The worst thing about this film was the constant references to the 80's and 80's horror films.Anyway.. this film still had some good stuff.. even though I can't remember what it is."
2,"What happened to ""Child's Play""?","When I started watching ""Bride of Chucky"" I was expecting it to be a great horror movie like the rest of the ""Child's Play"" series. I was disappointed after I saw it because I thought it was more of a comedy movie than it was a horror movie. It wasn't scary at all, in fact it was more silly than it was scary. I like comedy movies, but not when it comes to great series of horror flicks like ""Child's Play.""In my opinion, they ruined the classic ""Child's Play"" horror movies when they made this movie. ""Bride of Chucky"" is an alright movie, it's just not what I was expecting it to be after seeing all the other movies of the series. If you want to see a ""Child's Play"" movie that's not anything like the others in the series, you might like this movie."
1,wow. amazing. and?,"I was so surprised when I saw ""Bride of Chucky"". It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Lucky me.Highlight- the credits.don't you love it when its better than you thought?"
1,worst movie ever!!!!,this movie is really scary for little kids like 8 years old i think it should be rated R!!
1,That was the scariest movie I've ever seen,It is to disgusting for little kids. If my son ever watched that stupid movie I would cut it into pieces. I hate that chucky he kills to many people and his bride is a very discusting woman my wife never acts like and never did so you can take this movie and cram is up your @&*
1,Bride of Chunky,I watched this movie. I thought they lost track on the goal of the movie.they didn't stick to killing to people instead they tried killing each other.I thought the first 3 child's play were better.
1,"Is this a joke, or something ?","After than I saw Child's Play 3, I was hoping than the fourth part, Bride of Chucky it will be another great Chucky movie. Looks like I was very wrong ! Chucky isn't the same anymore, he's now a lover slave of Jennifer Tilly's Barbie version. And that ending...it's for real ? If that is Child's Play 4, I can't wait to watch number 5, Seed of Chucky, brrrrrrr...."
3,not what i expected but,this couldve been better if chucky was still chasing after Andy. But because of the kills and humor i give it a 3
4,Chucky was'nt Sucky.,"I never even saw any of the other ""Chucky"" movies. What drew me to this one was Jennifer Tilly. (She is one of my fav. actresses) Assuming Jennifer has good taste i figured this movie had to be alright. I was right! This movie plays upon itself as being over the top and ridiculous. If your half way descent in the brains department you would have already figured that out. The last thing in the world you should do is enter this movie with a preconceived notion that it is going to be a serious thriller. Jennifer Tilly pretending to be in an old time classic melodrama swooning over Chucky is an absolute riot. I love her! The grand finale had me cackling like a fool at 2 in the morning when the movie ended. I can't wait to watch it again someday. Brilliant movie surpisingly."
3,I Thought It Was PRetty Cool,"I think Bride Of Chucky was a great movie, but I think it would of been a lot better if they continued it from Child's Play 3 and put Tyler and Andy in it just like how my mom did it when she made up a script. Sandi Rules"
3,"A Fun Movie, Darling Dolls go on a murderous crime spree.","Now, this isn't the best movie, but it's entertaining and fun if you can accept the idea of talking, living, killing dolls. The people who gave it low ratings either don't like the plot, or they they think it was meant to be a horror movie. This is a true COMEDY. C'mon. I know that killlers trapped inside dolls is a little horror realated, but dolls smoking pot, making love, flipping people off, and cussing is just downright funny. Sure it has gory, dead people, but it doesn't scare you, unless you are scared easily. I saw this at night and I slept fine. It's worth the money. But all of this is my opinion. But I do reccomend it. And if you dont like it, it's your opinion. P.S. I enjoyed at the end how it left open space for another sequel."
5,Hilariously creepy,"I thought this movie was the second best in the series (Child's Play comes first, you never will be able to get past that). This movie was alot funnier and I think that the plot change was just the new blood (no pun intened) this series needed. Jennifer Tilly was a great addition, and the end had me in stiches."
3,A hiliarious 82 minutes,"Bride of Chucky was very funny. I saw it in the theatre and wasn't expecting anything special watching the DVD, but this has to be the best audio commentary tracks i've heard. Jennifer Tilly, Brad Dourif, and Chucky creator Don Mancini's commentary track was great. Aside from Tilly's nonstop rambling, I had fun hearing it. I don't know how they're gonna do part 5, Son of Chucky, but it'll be interesting. So, if you're in the mood for a laugh, or to be somewhat entertained I recommend Bride of Chucky."
4,A film by HK masters Ronny Yu and Peter Pau!,Bride of chucky comes from the fertile minds of Hong Kong director Ronny Yu (The Bride with White Hair) and brilliant cinematographer Peter Pau (John Woo's The Killer). These guys add some much-needed style and substance to an otherwise lame franchise. DVD looks great!
4,a great follow-up for anyone who liked Childs Play,"Jennifer Tilly brought him back to life, he kills her, she than becomes a doll w/murder that follows. With a very interesting ending, that makes you ask the question: Will there be another?"
5,"Jennifer Tilly breathes new life chuckie,after CP3)","Jennifer brings out the best in chuckie. This is only a movie, a FUN movie so anyone who tries to compare it to real life just doesn't get it. Just sit back, open your eyes (and mind) and enjoy!"
5,Great Service,My movie came just as it said it would from the manufacturer. It came quickly and in great condition.
5,Chucky's Bloody Honeymoon!!!,"I thought this was a really good installment to add to the franchise! This time, Chucky's not after Andy Barclay, Chucky has been resurrected by his smokin' hot girlfriend, Tiffany. Tiffany soon finds out that Chucky had no means to marry Tiffany, because she found an engagement ring the night Charles Lee Ray died and passed his soul into the Good Guy doll. When Chucky is locked in a playpen, he breaks out and kills Tiffany and transports her body into a doll too. They find out they need to travel to New Jersey to find the amulet Chucky was wearing the night he died. They hitch a ride with Jesse and Jade, a couple who want to be together, but Jade's uncle forbids it. They run away together and get married. During their honeymoon, Chucky and Tiffany kill anyone who gets in their way of the amulet. If you love Chucky, and romantic comedies, you'll love BRIDE OF CHUCKY!!!"
3,"Oh, Bride","Let's all thank Don Mancini. Seven years after the near bore and near death of the Child's Play franchise, Mancini breathed new life into his child. Taken in a completely different way than the previous sequels, Bride of Chucky finally makes Chucky the star. The storyline is now all his, but not just him. Jennifer Tilly gives the series an extra boost as Chucky's ex-lover who revives him in doll-form only to have Chucky put her in her own doll body.What ensues is spousal hilarity, and a lot more blood than the series has seen. There's also Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile as our main protaginists, but do we really care about them? Actually, I never did. Like I said, this is all Chucky's movie. John Ritter's cameo was actually the next best thing to the villians in the film."
3,"Finally, Chucky gets lucky!","This movie was hilarous and scary! I thought I would've hated it, but I liked it! The love scenes were great and the gore hasn't changed one bit!"
5,The Best!,"This is the best movie I have seen this year. The movie has Horror and comedy. Which makes me wanna see and support this movie. ""Bride of Chucky"" is a must see movie!!! People... See the movie!!!"
2,Toms bride of chucky review!,"Ok, too over the top. It has a good storyline to it about a serial killer using voodoo to teleport his soul into a doll. Though it is way unrealistic heres why:When the lorry hits this guy he explodes, there is nothing left of him.When she throws a bottle at some glass the mirror smashes and the particles of glass absolutley slaughter the people in the bed below, that wouldnt happen, you should see the amounto of blood shed.Chucky and his bride tiffany actually bleed, there dolls!... Not really good, disappointing"
3,Jennifer Tilly gives this series a very needed shot in the arm,I never really cared for this series until Jen came to it's rescue. It's almost logical that the series goes to comedy. I think the killer doll theme was done to death (no pun intended) So to keep this storyline alive the producers decided to go the dark comedy route. Makes sense. Jennifer really adds her own brand of dark comedy and that makes it work. Enjoy!
2,Chucky Gets Lucky.....,"OK, I'm a Chucky fan and have really enjoyed the Child's Play movies up until this one. When Chucky's old flame Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) sews Chucky back together and performs the voodoo chant over Chucky's body, Chucky is brought back to life. Not wanting to be the only one stuck in a doll's body, Chucky turns Tiffany into a killer doll just like him. The two of them then find themselves in the back of a vehicle of a young couple in love who plan on getting married. Then, Chucky and Tiffany get married. Together, they form a killer doll duo. This movie has very stupid scenes and is just plain silly. There are a couple of cool death scenes but overall, I think we could have done without Bride Of Chucky. So, for true horror fans, you will be disappointed because this movie is as much comedy as it is ""horror""."
2,Chucky turns sides,"Very sad movie...chucky goes from ruthless killer to Mini-Freddy, spillin gout jokes and quipps. Hes not scary and hes not funny...hes just a sad disaster played out on screen in the worst sequal to the Childs Play series.Chucky is resurresd by his old flame and puts her soul into a female doll and take a couple hostage to a cemetary across country to get a relic.This movie has so many unanswered questions...in the 3rd movie, chuckys is litterly blended into mush...in this movie, when we 1st see him, hes in some pieces...then he talks about how he can only transfer his soul into a body with the relic he was burried with...um..so then why didnt he need them in the first 3 movies?bad plot, bad acting...but Katherine Heigl in this movie is HOT! thats why i gave it 2 stars!this is more of a comedy than a horror...move on..youre not missing a thing..."
3,This movie was pretty funny,"After seeing the other Chucky movies, ""Bride"" really wasn't on my list. If it wasn't for Nick Stabile, with whom I went to high school with in Colorado, I probably still would not have seen it. As it turns out, it was a pretty funny flick. Of course, with any of these types of movies, you can't really take them serious! The first one was a bit creepy. Not scary. Yet stupid. This one pretty much kept me in stitches. The concept of how Chucky even came about was clever. Jennifer Tilly surprisingly did a good job of playing the bride. And given the story line he had to work with, Nick did a great job too!"
5,The greatest Chucky Film!,"I have seen the first Child's play when I was 12. It was cool. Then I see parts of 2 and 3, and there are not so good. But one day, in a rotative theater (That shows two movies at a time for 1 buck), I see this movie, and it was great. Bride of Chucky never pass in Colombian's serious theater! . But when I get out from the theater, I made a decition, ""I will have the DVD version of this film"", and when it comes out, I was amazed. The Extras on this disc are great, come'on, this is an average movie, and you get 2! commentaries, a little featurette, Jeniffer's diary and so. Also, this disc is the one of the latest Universal films that carries spanish subtitles, I don't know why, but they want to sink us with that crappy subtitled VHS, people, if you want to make money, put it. Otherwise Columbia, MGM and Disney will get our bucks."
2,Don't expect copies of the first movies,"because you will not get it with this. While seeing two dolls smole, sass each other and have sex is funny when finals time roll around, the rest of the year, it does not carry the same punch and is more bizzare than scary.I saw the first Child's Play movies when they came out, and this one is admittedly different from the others.While this is neither automaticaly bad nor good, I was glad I had free tickets to this movie because I probaly would not have wasted my time on it otherwise. The idea that two nonliving dolls can procreate is only one of the more off the wall portions of the film.I think that this movie is a prime example of what my parents were talking about when they said horror movies were the pinacle of camp, cheese and shock and I was too engrossed in it to really listen."
4,Nick Stabile is soooo HOT!,"I loved this movie because it was so unexpected. Very funny and scary enough. Tilly is one of today's best actresses but most underrated. And back to Mr. Stabile, OH MY GOD. If I ran into him the word no would not be in my vocabulary."
2,The stupidiest movie ever made!,"1st of all: This is not even a horror movie - 2nd of all: If you hide Tilly's face, she's hot.The addition of Chucky's bride is very stupid, but the way she dies is fun. The other 3 Chucky movies were nice, but this one and Seed Of Chucky were made just because there were no more stories, but the way they decided to continue the history was very, very bad. The special effects are just bad, the ending is the worst ending they could have made to end this ""horror"" movie, that is nothing but a stupid comedy movie.If you still haven't watched this, don't do it and keep away from this..."
2,Coming to the stage now.....,"Was this supposed to be a Horror Movie? I found it to be more comedic. That is one problem with horror sequels. The killer become Comedians. Freddy, Chucky, Etc.I hate that. They are violent, demonic, psychotic. Let them be that. This movie had not reason to be made. Chucky was killed 3 previous times. The first should have been it. No more. Unforutnatly, this movie threatens to bring another sequel. The Son of Chucky...It's coming, I'm sure.......very bland, but colorful, and funny, but i don't watch chucky to laugh"
3,"Cheezy, not scary........","but never the less very likeable and funny. Chucky (Brad Dourif) gets his funniest script yet. The eariler ""Child's Play"" is a lot smarter I thought. If you want to see this movie, but have not seen the other ""Child Play's"" yet I suggest you see them first. That way your more up to date on what is really going on. The movies highligt in my opinion was how much this movie made creative use from James While's untochauble classic ""The Birde of Frankenstien"". This is certainly worth renting and watching(not buying) in my opinion, but I still would not recommend this to just anyone."
3,i could watch new chucky movies forever,chucky is ressurected by a voodoo [prostitute].she gets turned into a doll too.so now theres 2 killer dolls.the voodoo [prostitute] was a [prostitute] in let it ride and liar liar also.kids wont gain anything positive by viewing this one.they spent more money on this one than before so its easier to sit through.it is easily the best chucky movie.there is two ok chick s .who does NOT strut her stuff .there are a few irritating characters.a control freak cop and his lackey and a whole smorgasboard of spasmadic-drama queens wrapped up in a mans body.i just dont see why movie audiences feel it necessary to throw a jerry springer style gay man into every movie.so what?youre gay.get over it.the real deal is this is the most violent and also the funniest teen horror film in a long long time.
4,Too Funny!,I have seen this movie at least 3 times at the most and I most say this movie is indeed hilarious. This film appears to be more of a comedy than a horror film and it's definately not for 11 year olds to be watching. It's definately worth adding to the video collection.
4,Great movie! Chucky gets lucky,"It`s a long time since I saw the previous movies, so I can`t remember what they were like, but this is without doubt a really great movie. The combination of horror and comedy suits the film excellent. I think the film deserves more than 4 stars, but not as much as 5 stars, so let`s say 4 1\2 stars. I`ve also heard rumours about another follow-up, which will have the title: ""Child Of Chucky"". I`m really looking forward to it!"
3,This movie's okay,"Chucky's old girlfriend retreives his body and revives him. They quarrel, she gets mad, he turns her into a doll, and the two go on a cross-country killing spree with two forbidden lovers to dig up Chucky's corpse. Funny and entertaining up to a point but only at the very end does this get stupid. Pizza and Pepsi."
4,A wild combination of funny and horror,"Well I never saw any child play movies except for this one, and this one was funny but not scary. I think this movie was good but not great. It makes me wanna see the other chucky movies. So if you like funny movies see this one but if your in for the horror part skip it."
4,"Funny, Witty and odd",I Saw the 2 and 3 they were kinda dumb( especaly 3) But Bride of Chuncky is a spoof of Natural Born Killers and it does it well it weird and fun and i highly recomend it as a cult classic.
1,"bride of chucky, should be banned for its stupidness.","first off, how could a doll kill people, i know its possessed and stuff but can't they just get like 5 really big people and have them sit on chucky. because all i know is that if some stupid little doll came running after me with a knife, i would kick it accross the room and than step on it. if only the people in this movie knew that. with that said and done, the first one was good, the second one was okay, the third one was annoying and this one is just beyond annoying. stop the series you are ruining it!"
1,"""Why dont they stop?""","This movie is dumb! Why does the director keep making chucky movies? I hate these movies. Great,now i have to see privews of this on tv! ! bet in 2,000 there will be childs play 5!"
2,Bride Of Chucky,"I feel out of place giving this such a low score, but its how I feel! The first time I watched this back in '98 when it came out, I thought it was pretty good. Then I recently watched it again and I thought it was so stupid, these Chucky movies arent scarry at all, I dont understand why people think they are! Its kind of more like a comedy than a horror! But whatever, If you like these Childs Play movies, youll probably like this one!"
1,Chucky Needs to Burn,"I hated this movie so much, I wanted to pour hot spices into my eyes. ""Bride of Chucky"" is the worst thing to have ever been created and I'm sorry that I even watched a couple seconds of it. Chucky comes back to kill his girlfriend and performs a voodoo ritual to put her soul in a doll. They make quite the couple and I got quite the migraine! Two dolls in love, enough said. There aren't any big names in this movie and I don't know why John Ritter made an appearance in this bubbling waste! The deaths are gruesome and unbelievable. The dialogue is so bad, I thought I was watching ""Blue's Clues"". But, ""Blue's Clues"" is way better and Steve makes this look like the hell. Please don't ever make another movie with dolls again. No more torture."
1,Chucky is a twisted doll I would incinerate,Chucky is a bomb not da bomb. This is the best rating I'll ever give it. The best out of all the Chucky movies. But a sorry piece of gutter trash.
2,This is not a HORROR MOVIE!,"First of all let me say that after watching Child?s Play 2 and 1 I got to say that Chuckie was one of the dolls that used to freak me out back when I was a kid. When I heard a new movie was coming to a release I thought I had to see it.Let me tell you that this isn't an horror movie. Sure it has blood but is nothing special or better than the first movie. Why? Because Chuckie itself is dishonoured this is more like a typical summer flick, it sucks, chuckie in this movie is not even scary anymore. (OMG HE HAS A BRIDE!) Big deal? NO! some of the dialogue in this movie made me laugh and same thing happened with the kills, it just didn't feel like an horror movie.The final sequence of the movie was very well made so that's why my two star rating. If you are a fan of Child's Play give it a rental, but remember that this is not an HORROR MOVIE. Is laughable. Just what the directors had in mind? (Money)."
3,CHUCKY IS AWESOME,I thought Bride Of Chucky was the best in the series and also my second favorite comes Child's Play 2. I have an obsession with wanting Chucky to come back ever since I saw Child's Play 3 and then Bride Of Chucky came out and now I have an obsession with wanting Chucky to come back. Chucky Rules.
1,another one?,"surprise,surprise,surprise,another movie in which chucky trys to kill people, with one or two twists,he has a wife that helps him. for those of you who have'nt seen this movie don't bother, its even more lame than the original childs play movies. to anyone who helped make this lame movie I have one things to say,#1 this movie sucks,END"
4,Good,"Well, as someone else said, this looked disappointing. But, also as before, you will be suprised. Hilarious, chilling and absurd, you could be suprised, Chucky is reinvented as a wisecracking psycho, not just a psycho, and Tiffany is a show-stealer. CHILD's PLAY:Good CHILD's PLAY 2: Different, good but for a different audience CHILD's PLAY 3: Same as above. Bride of CHUCKY: Different, but for everybody! (Except kids!)"
2,How lucky is Chucky?,"Chucky's old flame steals the doll, revives him, and is only appropriately turned into a doll herself when she doublecrosses him. The two then hitch a ride with a young couple to New Jersey to get an amulet that will enable them to switch bodies with them. Hands down, the best sequel which mixes gore and some great laughs. The better jokes involve a certain infamous homemaker with her own television show. But despite these plusses, the whole thing falls apart near the end when Tilly gets roasted which effects her performance, though she does deliver all the good lines."
5,Chucky gets lucky,"Ten years after the notorious Lake Shore Strangler Charles Lee Ray was gunned down, his longtime girlfriend Tiffany gets ahold of his remains, rebuilds him (sort of) and brings him back to life in hopes of resuming their love affair.But Chucky has other plans. He is more interested in transferring his soul to another human being. In a fit of rage, a heartbroken Tiffany locks him in a cage and buys Chucky a bride doll as a joke. Chucky takes this new doll, electocutes Tiffany in the bathtub and turns her into a pint sized little terror.Together, they highjack a pair of unsuspecting newlyweds and take them hostage with plans to take over their bodies. Chucky and Tiffany end up resuming their romance with some of the most hilarious love scenes ever. (""I am anatomically correct you know..."")A great horror/comedy!"
5,"Byrne 5,march 1999",This is the best movie of chucky.I hope that there gone make a child's play 5.(the son of chucky)
5,This movie rocks!!!,"Okay--this is one of my favorite, absolute favorite, movie of all time! I love it so much that I'm officially 'outing' myself here publicly as someone who totally loves this horror/comedy, a movie that is hilarious, and incredibly gory..but in a good way! Folks, anything with the Chucky doll in it is probably going to have a huge amount of blood, and add the second doll, and a large amount of dry, sarcastic humor, not to mention a lot of wonderful small references to other horror movies, and you have a winner.. The opening scene that takes place in the police office's evidence room is on of my favorites! And finally, when you watch the movie, and start to note inconsistencies, please remember, it's a horror movie with 'living' dolls in it who kill people and fall in love. That requires a HUGE amount of being able to suspend your disbelief, okay? Just keep saying 'it's only a movie, it's only a movie'.."
5,"Chucky, you are the best! -- Charles Lee Ray live forever","Wooow! Excellent!. Bride of chucky is an example of the best horror film since last ten years (I include Halloween H20, another great movie). Brad Dourif's voice..better than ever!"
4,Integrative Document & Content Management book review,Covers all the relevant aspects of DMS and more. Very comprehensive.
2,For the beginner,"If you know anything about garnishing this book is not for you. The stuff in here is very simple. After I got it, I figured out it was a waste of time and money."
2,,"A good book for the beginner, nothing too complicated, don't expect stunning displayes for buffets etc."
2,Ordinary,"Being in the food business, I was looking for something different for garnishing. This was just okay."
3,Adequate for beginners,"The garnishes presented in this book are very simple to make. However, they appear as though they are simple to make. Any advanced student or serious chef will undoubtedly be disappointed with the level of artistry within. Beginners will enjoy their first exploration of eye appeal using this book."
4,Black and the Fannies crank up the amps,"This is an excellent little EP. You wouldn't think that Frank Black's melancholy howl would make an ideal counterpart to Teenage Fanclub's feelgood melodies. However, on this set, which comprises two fantastic Black-penned numbers (""The Man Who Was Too Loud"" and ""Jacques Tati"") and two well chosen covers, the Glaswegians show that they can rock with the best of 'em, even the King of Alternative Rock himself.The Fannies provide a coruscating backing throughout, not without their melodic genius, (check out the fabulous outro to ""Jacques Tati"" and the intro to ""Sister Isabel""), while Black's off-kilter genius shines throughout. Go buy."
1,FRANKLY disappointing,Teenage Fanclub are just about my favourite band and I really like some of The Pixies back catalogue BUT this session is one big mistake. Frank Black's tunes are devoid of melody and/ or warmth and humanity. If you want to hear a great Teenage Fanclub collaboration go for excellent Teenage Fanclub with Jad Fair team up Words of Wisdom and Hope and forget about this blotch on an other wise pretty much flawless release history from TFC.
4,Hed Kandi's Done it Again.,"Hed Kandi is one of the most venerable labels in dance music, coming up with great double-disc compilations of grooves courtesy of Mark Doyle. On the third volume of ""Disco Kandi,"" we get soulful vocals and funky house that sometimes recall the 1970s. Ann Nesby's pumped up ""Lovin' Is Really My Game,"" Loleeta Holloway's ""Dreamin',"" and ""The Player"" by First Choice are some of the highlights that make ""Disco Kandi Volume 3"" worth the trip. It's obviously not the best of the series, but it ain't half-bad either."
3,I was not impressed,"I hate to be the voice of dissent here, but I found Finch's book of poems, Eve, to be rather medoicre. There was nothing particularly novel or captivating about them. Truly good poetry has that 'something special' about it that just leaps off the page and grabs you and Finch doesn't do that, though I respect her as a scholar."
2,Missed Opportunity,"This should be really good (with the long version of Let's Stay Together) and could have been the perfect companion to the expanded Greatest Hits, but they really botched it up and failed miserably with a very questionable selection of songs. Where are ""I've Never Found A Girl"", ""Ain't No Fun To Me"", and ""Rhymes""? They could get rid of some of the newer stuff that is not very good and really suffers next to the classics. Who puts these things together anyway???????? Huge missed opportunity."
4,WOW!,"This album absolutely rocks. Of course, if fulfills my need for something dirty, it's hard and the lyrics and music are great!My favorite track is ""Terrorvision"" I think the lyrics are just awesome and the chorus can have me singing for hours!This stuff is heavy and not for the faint of heart. If you like heavy metal, then here you go. It has a chick fronter, and she rocks of course.I'm eagerly awaiting their new album which is due out in the summer I believe!"
2,Genitortures - 'Sin City' (Cleopatra),"I'll give it 2 1/2 stars.'Sin City' is the band's second CD as I'm sorry to say that it's not as good as I had expected.It's fair.One could describe their music as industrial metal.Their lead vocalist/sex circus ringleader known simply as Gen is quite the outrageous show girl while performing live out on tour.I've seen the band once on this very tour as I remember Gen brought out two women dressed as young Catholic school girls and as each song progressed to the next,Gen kept increasing the two girl's punishments.They almost make the Plasmatics and Gwar seem like Romper Room.As for the tunes that I thought were decent are ""Terror Vision"",their AC/DC cover ""Squealer"",""4 Walls Black"" and ""Crucified""(at the concert I saw,they did some unmentionable sacrilegious things).Honestly,when I attended this show,I almost thought I was at a taping of the Jerry Springer show,on S&M night.Might appeal to fans of Marilyn Manson,Leather Strip and possibly Die Cheerleader."
4,Mommy and Daddy won't Like This!!!,Great album from the band. Recomended that you buy it. DONT EVEN THINK YOU CAN PLAY THIS IN FRONT OF MOM AND DAD!!!!!I Don't get it ....Britney Spears or any other women on MTV have NOTHING compared to Gen.Gen is the BEST.
2,A far cry from 120 Days,"I love 120 Days, but am very disappointed in this disc. Gone are the heavy riffs and are replaced by an overdose of industrial sounds. 120 Days was a perfect blend of both. The only tracks I cared for are: Sin City, One Who Feeds, Squealer."
3,Sin City,"I loved this album, but felt it sounded just a little too much like Lords of Acid. Don't get me worng, I love them too, but Lords of Acid is supposed to sound like Lords of Acid. A good listen, but very lacking in originality. I've already got most of the Lords of Acid albums, if I wanted more, I finish out my collection."
2,Umm...no...,"Why in hell did I buy this? That's really the only thing that ran through my head while listening to this. The songs are not well-written. ""Hail to the freaks""? I mean, really, please. Spare us. And why are there snippets of screaming/laughing/begging-for-Mommy children on just about every other song? It's damned pathetic. The only reason I'm giving this thing two stars instead of one is that fact that Gen's real cute and she has a pretty good voice. My advice to her: go to a few remedial song-writing courses, lose the fascist husband, and for the love of god, STOP with the satanic overtones! That's been done before, and it wasn't even cool then. If she does all of that, the woman will be the pinnacle of cool. Oh, and yes, she'd be even cooler if she bared her chest on the insert pictures more often."
2,Academic Drivel,"This is a series of essays that give insight into life in the Middle Ages. But not a lot of insight. Really, this book is academia at its most pompous. I believe the authors were competing to see who could write the most and say the least. I do not respect that. The history of the Middle Ages is interesting. Interesting enough to be told in an interesting manner. This book takes a great subject and makes it boring. Thanks."
1,Scratched cd's should never be sold on Amazon,The cd was scratched when I received it. Plain and simple I cannot use it. Thanks for wasting my time and money!
1,i bought one and it did not work for me,"I bought one of your linksys booster, and it did not work out for me. I dont really know what is wrong with it i tryed it with a linksys assespoint, but it did not work as well.I am not happy with this product beacuse i cant use it and my money is gone what can be done."
4,Useful product,"I'm using this signal booster with my BEFW11S4 and noticed a significant increase in the distance that I can be away from the wireless router. Before I attached the booster, I would be able to get no further than about 35 feet before I lost my signal. Now I can be almost anywhere in my house (2 stories and 3000+ sqaure feet) and still be able to connect. I'd recommend one to all Linksys wireless router owners."
4,Works Like a Charm - After Figuring out Set Up,"The product, used and like new signal booster, was as the seller described, except I wasn't aware that I would need to purchase a power adapter. The seller only said that it was missing the ""sleeve,"" and it was confusing as to why that would matter when purchasing a used item. After I got the correct power adapter, it took awhile to figure out what to do with the antennas on the router. It wasn't apparent that I had to remove the caps on the base of the antennas for them to fit on the signal booster. Information on set up from the seller or the manufacturer's site would have eliminated the frustration in getting the booster up and running. Once I got it all together, it worked beautifully and I am very happy with the results."
1,Only got another 10 feet,"I only got another 10 feet of range from this booster. I bought this product with an expectation it would give me the last 25 feet to have the signal go through my house and onto the patio. Honestly, another 10 feet isn't worth the price."
2,Booster? Get serious.,"Easy installation but wildly overstated in the ""boost"" dimension. A/B (with, without) the ""boost"" in my environment shows at most 10-15% extension of the diameter of a useable signal. A near neighbor has found precisely the same ""boost"" in his environment. Both environments are typical, multi-room, multi-level suburban homes. Buyer beware."
1,WSB24,Recently installed Linksys router and cannot get signal @ 34 feet away from AP. Bought booster and the signal barely improved!How can Linksys get away with this? I have a $30 cordless phone that has better reception than my $300+ wireless system!
1,"Garbage, pure garbage.","I purchased one of these units to punch up the signal throughout my house and it had the opposite effect. With the ""booster"" powered on, my wireless signal dropped to less than 10% even three feet from the access point! When it was removed the signal returned to 100%. All of these positive reviews must be Linksys employees or the Linksys quality control is going downhill fast. Avoid this thing at all costs unless you want total frustration. If I could give it zero stars, I'd do that."
2,disappointing,"I was getting little or no signal out on my porch, where with the nice weather I wanted to try working on my Dell laptop. I could not get email most of the time, and terminal sessions or web site loads would often time out. (10 feet away, inside the house, the signal is fine.) All of this is on the same (ground) floor as my BEFW11S4 wireless router. A friend bought this booster to get the signal to his daughter's 2nd floor bedroom, but it did not help. It may have also toasted the router. He was unable to return it, so he gave it to me to try.I only got a marginal improvement - connections now just barely hang on, but are so slow as to be useless on the porch. Hope it does not toast my unit (my friend's hired expert said there were reliability problems with the Linksys equipment - high failure rate)."
1,Not Worth It,"I hooked up the Linksys Wireless Signal Booster as described. It definately was very easy to set up. However, once everything was connected, my signal decreased. I used to be able to use my laptop downstairs in my house (my wireless router is upstairs) with a marginal signal. With the booster attached, I was unable to connect to the network. The booster accomplished the exact opposite of what I was trying to accomplish. Maybe I had a defective product. I ended up returing the WSB24 to get my money back."
1,Useless....,"Parts of my house only receive a 20% signal strength. I was so excited to see a product that might actually make surfing throughout the house more enjoyable.The product was incredibly easy to insall, however it made mininal difference on my signal strength. It was still in the 20% range.I use both a Linksys router and a Linksys 802.11 card for my laptop.Also, the tollfree # for technical support had been disconnected. Very frustrating."
1,Just buy another router....,"I'm also not sure what people were thinking when they reported improved reception, where they just copying the text from the Linksys marketing department? I see absolutely NO improvement in reception. In fact, I see WORSE reception! I used to get a full 100%/100% signal sitting right next to the router, now I don't even get that! There was no better range either... it stayed the same.My advice is to STAY AWAY! Save your money on this. In fact, the best bet is to take this money and just buy another wireless router and place it near where you want a better signal. This is what I did. I now have two seperate networks that I switch between manually. It's not a hassle to change SSID's, just keep your other settings the same, and it sure works better than this ""booster"""
2,Hitachi C10FCE,"I purchased this saw at a local home center and being a trim carpenter, it looked like a nice light saw for small mouldings. After using it for a short time the base started to bind up, so I took it apart and cleaned it out . It had collected alot of saw dust and crud in a short time. I reassembled the saw and it work fine for a few more times. I just went to use this saw the other day and noticed the space/bearing had came out the bottom of the saw, now it has to much play to make a good accurate cut. I belive you get what you pay for and I got a $130.00 saw."
1,save your money,This bird feeder is a joke. It is really small. The pre-drilled holes were too deep for the nails to grab.
5,"it was an great cd, with good music","the way they put there music together is really cool. they have a great cd, and i enjoyed listening to it"
4,Blessid Union CD,I was very pleased with my CD purchase. I have always been fond of the vocals and style of music that they present.
5,Wow!,"I like every song on this cd and there isn't one I don't like! If you like alternative rock, you'll like it just the same, too! My favorite songs are ""Jelly,"" ""Scenes From A Coffee House (You'll Always Be Mine),"" and ""It's Your Day (Bronson's Song)."" ""My Friend"" and ""Humble Star"" are cool, too!"
3,Grows on you,"While many were discouraged with this, their second album (and I was too when it first came out), but after listening to it a while (and aging some myself) this is the best second album I've heard in a very long time! While younger audiences might not get as much out of it as they did their third album or even the first, older, more mature listeners will find the complex themes fascinating. Just like their first album, it works best as a whole, but individual songs have thier own merit as well. Probably this band's buried treasure to be discovered much later by thier fans."
5,Loved it so much i bought 2!!!,I've had the CD since it first came out... and played it to death... and after moving i realized i lost it somewhere...sooo ARGH!!!! anyway...i just HAVE to have this CD on me....perfect for rainy days or days you just need a boost or new perspective on life.... I love each and every song. Well off to buy my second copy.
4,Only one bad song? This album is great!!!,"First of all, I actually don't actually own this cd. I taped it from my cousin's cd. And this album is good. Really good. (suprisingly good, especially for a ROCK album!) There's only one bad song on it, though, ""Humble Star."" They say, ""Hell-Bound"" in it, and I don't like it when people talk about Hell in music. But the rest of the album is fine. The rest of it is all really good. A few of my favorite songs are, ""Jelly,"" ""Scenes From A Cofee House (You'll Always Be Mine),"" and, ""It's Your Day (Bronson's Song),"" but I like other songs, too. I reccommend this album to you."
5,a pretty good book,this is my favorite of the books i have read.sometimes sam's choices seem right when she makes them but thier sometimes wrong. that's part of the book.i havent read dawn runner yet.i want to find out what happens to hot spot.i also wonder what kind of horse shy boots grows up to be. i think this is my favorite.
1,Word-for-word translation can be a laugh,"This book is undoubtedly a well-meant effort in a field that receives hardly any attention in the United States. Unfortunately, most of the poems/sayings/proverbs are translated word-for-word, with little or no effort spent on rhyme, rhythm, or even grammar. The result is often unintentionally comical."
3,quirky but cheaply made,"I love the idea of having a pirates flag at the house-- If I dont do these things, no one will! Anyways, its a cute flag, but Ive only had it for a few months and the black is already starting to fade and one corner of it is ripping (it sort of looks more pirate-authentic actually) and I have no idea how since its been hanging since I bought it! For the price, I wouldnt expect much more."
2,pirate flag reveiew,"Yes, it is a bargain so I suppose that should of clued me in. In the end it's only a few dollars so I'm not that upset but I did loose out on time. What I don't like is that the flag is basically see-through, which is of cheap construction. Just wanted to post this for others looking for a higher quality product."
4,Pirate Flag,I really liked the Jolly Roger flag. I'm still looking for a smaller one just like it for our boat but this will work great for the flat pole.
2,"Nice design, low quality",The flag was really thin. Could easily make out facial features of my son on the other side looking through it without additional lighting. If you're just going to hang it on the wall it's fine if you don't mind being able to see the poor match-up of fabric near the grommets through the white.
2,Didn't last 1 day.,"Used at a volleyball game so friends could find us amongst many other nets. There was a pleasant breeze that afternoon, but that was enough to tear off both grommets and the threading. It's very thin, lightweight fabric that you can see through. I will now spend more for a higher-quality nylon version."
5,ARRRRGGG!,really cute flag. works perfectly in the pirate room i did for my three year old. my son loves it.
3,Won't last long,It is a cheap flag and won't be used much which is a good thing because it will wear out fast.
4,jolly roger pirate flag,I hung the flag on the wall in my grandson's newly decorated pirate themed bedroom. They loved it. The price was right and it was what I had expected it to be.
1,i'm sure i woulda loved it if they didn't just take my money and run....,"I ordered 3 pirate flags, from 2 different companies, for my father for Fathers Day. I received 2 of them, however, the one from this company never showed up. When contacted, the only thing the company wanted to know was why I didn't order all 3 flags from their company. Never once did they ask to find out what happened to my order, or offer to refund me, or send me the damn flag. I give them an ""F"" as a company, and in customer service. Thanks, Clint, I know what company I won't be referring to my friend's, or my parents nonprofit pirate organization..."
2,Long Winded and Off Subject,"The correct title of this book is ""Designing Campus Portals"". It is a collection of research papers written by Profs. There is very little information regarding ""designing a portal"". If you are involved with a higher education portal then the content contained will be of some intrest. But if you are doing anything corporate in nature you will find this book absolutely frustrating as the style is very academic."
4,ALOT of meat recipes,"I was hoping for more vegetarian dishes, or at least things that were easily adaptable. Instead the meat dishes are really meat with a few other things, not like casseroles.If I had to do it again, I would purchase the comfort food recipe book instead."
3,too late to return or I would,"I was very pleased with this book when I started reviewing the recipes. I bought it as a gift for someone just starting Weight Watchers. It's very detailed and has a lot of nice pictures. However, pages 192-216 are not only duplicated but they're inserted half way thru the book AND upside down! I'm afraid it's too close to Christmas to return it for a replacement so I'm keeping it and hoping my friend will get a laugh out of it like I did when I first saw it. I never new Amazon to sell seconds but this would surely qualify as one."
2,Simply Delicious Weight Watchers,"I was a little disappointed in the book, I was expecting much more. There were only a couple recipes that I would even make but someone else might enjoy it. On a more positive note the shipping and price was great."
2,just not for me,"This book contains a lot of recipes that are good, but It is a waste of money for the average chef. The recipes are easy to follow, but most recipes require ingredients that the normal household doesn't keep on hand. Spices are not cheep. They also require a lot of fresh veggies, which once again are not cheep. There were only a few recipes that I didn't have to go buy special ingredients for. It was a waste of my money, but then again cooking isn't the #1 priority in my day. If you enjoy cooking and making special dishes then it would definitely be a good book for the cook on weight watchers."
2,Mostly Untradtional Stuff You'd Never Cook,This book contained a great deal of recipes that were just stuff that you wouldn't really cook. I found FOUR recipes I wanted out of it and I'm not a picky eater.
4,Good recipes but poor index!,"I enjoy the recipes, which are often different from my other low fat cookbooks, and the information is very helpful. So far, everything I've tried has been tasty. But the index at the back is very poorly done! Categories are not listed, such as ""potatoes"" or ""beef;"" the list often gives only the names of the dishes, listed by words like ""crispy,"" ""roasted,"" ""warm"" or ""creamy"", which is frustrating when you are looking to find a recipe for the ingredients you have. The book is not organized in the most helpful way, either, with pictures in groups, rather than next to the recipes themselves."
4,YUMMY!,"New to the WW plan and so enjoying this great cookbook. Took it with me last month to my sister-in-law's while on vacation and we cooked meals from it. She sure was impressed, joined WW on-line by the time we left.The recipes I've tried are quite easy and taste wonderful. So different from when I was on the plan 25 years ago. So many great choices with the points already figured out for me. I write additional recipes that I find online or at meetings on the pages in the cookbook so all of my WW recipes are together.Would definitely recommend!"
4,lot of good recipes,"This book has a lot of good recipes, most with low points values. Most of the meals are surprisingly filling considering the low points values."
2,Simply Delicious,"Good cookbook, but I prefer more pictures of the food before I make it....especially diet food!"
2,Simply Delicious: 245 No-Fuss Recipes--All 8 POINTS or Less,I know this got very good ratings--stars--but I was totally underwhelmed by this book. I returned it. I don't need another book that doesn't have the kind of recipes I like to cook.
3,a little disappointed,"I am on Weight Watchers, so I wanted a recipe book to help me along. I'm a little disappointed with this one because the recipes are a little more complicated than I wanted. I ended up buying another WW book, ""Hit the Spot"". It has much simpler recipes; it is more what I was looking for."
4,easy WW recipes,The recipes were easy to create and the food ended up being delicious. Makes staying on the WW point system so much easier. Would highly recommend this book if you are on the Weight Watchers points plan.
5,The Washington Manual Internship Survival Guide,I highly recommend this book to interns. it covers most of the topics that you may encounter on your internship oncall. it cover the subjects stepwise and you will know what to do next. it is very helpfull if you are alone and nobody around to tell you what to ask or what to order or how to handle the case. it is very easy to use and not time consuming to find a topic fast when you are oncall and time is short.
2,OK but Way OVER PRICED!!!,"You are an intern on your first call and you want a good back up for your bloged memory,right!, especially at around, oh say 3 am. When that lovely grey haired know it all nurse call you back to resident reality, from your somber coma, you better sound like you have a clue to what you are doing! My advise to all of you is to go to your friendly neighborhood ""book bank"" and spend time reading this before you buy this on hearsay as I did!!! It is a cutes-see-tute-see lil book!! Spend your parents money on something a lil more in detail ie ""scutmonkey"" or InternalMedicine on Call.....Remember read before you buy!"
1,micromate,1. it was suppose to be in bulk...only got one2. It wont fit into most slots except maybe a laptop !3. when it fits it works well !!!
1,Broken before first use,"I opened my card reader tonight and plugged it in for the first time. When I put my card in the slot, nothing happened. I pulled the reader out and looked all over for maybe an on/off switch, but nothing. Then I heard something rattling around, kind of like a coin was inside of it. I looked in the slot but did not see anything. I guess there is something broken inside the reader.Well, here's the good news and the very reason I am not upset about this whole thing. Sure, I'd really love to have my card reader before going on my vacation this week, but that's what Wal-mart is for. I logged into my Amazon account and looked around for how to return something. It was amazing how easy it is! All I have to do is print out my return label and send it off! In a couple of days, I will have a refund on my card. I love Amazon!So, yes, I gave this product a single star rating. I'm not sure how it works because I never got to use it. Oh well, that's life!"
2,its thick body doesnt allow use with many front panel usb slots,"i read this in other reviews but i was allured by its nice and unique aesthetic appearance and bought it anyway. it really doesnt cater to use with alot of usb slots cuz of the width of the thing, buy another"
2,No good,Not so good No. I want this soap. Has no interestNot so good No. I want this soap. Has no interest
3,Sulphu soap,Product is way overpriced. I have purchase same item at one-third the price...first and last time at this place for me.
2,It was ok,"I did not see any improvements using this, but it smelled nice. I used black soap and it works wonders."
2,Broke me out even more!,"When I researched for a natural soap containing sulfur, this was one of the the ones that made me curious enough to buy. Wrong idea! After a few days of usage, my mildly affected acne face broke out intensely with cystic and painful acne. Very weird due to the fact that I use DDF's sulfur mask weekly and Proactiv's sulfur mask maybe once a month with no problems/irritations. Soap smells great, was yellow..not white as pictured and did nothing but ultimately break me out. I will stick to Dudu Osun's black soap [...] that really works for my combination acne skin and is very cost effective as well. Also, the soap box does not disclose the percentage amount of sulfur at all on its packaging as it does in the product description (3% supposedly) listed here on Amazon."
2,not impressive,"I got this to treat acne, however, it dries skin and does not seem to have any beneficial/ therapeutic advantage. Doesn't seem to benefit keratosis pilaris either. For about 10 dollars- a total waste, with nice packaging."
2,Adovia Sulfur Soap,"A bit more irritating to the skin than other sulfur soaps I've tried. I prefer the brand Sulfo-lo instead, which contains 3% Sulfur. Also, the Adovia soap is yellow in color, not white like in picture(not a big deal). Smell is better compared to other sulfur soaps."
2,amazing how.....,It's amazing how one of the band's least stellar efforts is still better than all the other crap that was on the radio. Should have been promoted more. Could have been a very successful album......
4,Thought provoking - evolve,"This album did not offer hits. Instead it had something for you to think about. ""Hero"" was my personal favorite - because it fits with a certain time in my life. That is what this release offers. Somethng to relate to. The music is pared down and it does disappoint a little... but the sign of a band that will stay around is one that is not afraid to experiment. Rush is a wonderful example of this. I love each Rush CD for itself - there is a cohesiveness, but they are all different from one another. Like Queesnsryche. I do hope this band will be around for a long time because I enjoy the evolution."
4,good for laying back,"I usually listen to less ""decipherable"" music, but i decided to give a queensryche album a try. i bought this used, and can't compare it to any of the old stuff. here's what i can tell you. I really enjoy this album. It's great for laying back and just listening. The music is liquid, and although it doesn't have a hard edge, it's still really good stuff. i'm glad i bought it, and i will try other albums too. i really recommend this."
2,It's the Chris DeGarmo show!,"It's Chris DeGarmo's world--Geoff, Michael, Scott and Eddie are ""privileged"" to share it. The first time I heard ""Sign Of The Times"", I knew that DeGarmo was the sole writer, and it didn't surprise me to see that he wrote much of the rest of the album. God, Chris, we know you got nominated for a Grammy for ""Silent Lucidity"" and everything, but did you really have to boot Geoff out of the room and sing that horrible Sgt. Pepper ripoff whose title mercifully eludes me? The Ryche was going through the motions here, and it shows. Makes you wonder how good interband relations were at the time of recording . . . Not as bad as ""Q2K"", but definitely not their best work."
2,AHHHH!!!! CRAP!!!!!!,what were they thinking!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!! please stay away from this one if your a prog fan. first metallica now them ......
3,"Good, but not great","I love Queensryche, but this is not my favorite album by far. There are many excellent songs on this album, and I do choose this album in particular when I am looking for a certain feeling, but overall, this is one side of Queensryche that I like, but I don't love. The lyrics are certainly different, almost spiritual in nature, and I can never fault their musical ability. This album grows on you only if you let it... a mature side of any band tends to do that, though."
2,"Uh,well,it's Queensryche. Or is it?","This is definitely not comparable to 'Operation:Mindcrime' or any of the other older stuff, and I am not too pleased. ""Sign of the Times"" and ""You"" are the only songs I really like here. The rest are just too boring, and completely lack a ""metal edge."" If you are a fan of old Queensryche, I can't say that I would recommend this one to you. Oh well, it's head and shoulders above 'Q2K.'"
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,"If you're a Queensryche fan of old then this album is NOT fo you. Queensryche used to embody POWER, HEART and SOUL, this album embodies dollar signs. 'Let's see if we can fall into the Alternative groove.' Promised Land isn't like Mindcrime or Warning, but it was still a damn good album. Here in the Now Frontier has really made me question how much Queensryche enjoys the spirit of music over the trend of music. Remember: Alternative music is just as is says ... Alternative to music. If you want Queensryche buy any of the other previous albums ... stay away from this one."
1,Queensryche's Worst CD. Period.,"At best, this is a ""transition"" CD moving towards the band's new sound. A worst, this is a ""cash in"" album that allowed the bad to purchase a few new cars. Very bad. Very, very bad. God, I would give my arm for the unity and harmony of the old Queensryche."
1,What a disappointment!!!,"I was so bummed when I bought this cd. I love Queensryche, think ""Mindcrime"" and ""Empire"" are the two best albums of all-time, and think all their pre-1997 albums are amazing. I heard ""You"" on the radio in August of '97 before the album was released and absolutely loved it. I was so pumped about getting it. Then after playing it about 5 times I realized that I hated 12 songs, thought ""Spool"" was ok, and still loved ""You""(probably my 4th favorite Ryche song). This is not Queensryche...its Matchbox 20 meets Blond Melon with the great Geoff Tate doing vocals. The lyrics are uninspired, the melodies aren't melodic, and the songs have no catchyness. If you see the album for 7 bucks or less get it for ""You"", but otherwise it is a waste of money. Buy the old ones first."
4,good cd,"I LIKE THIS CD VERY MUCH,ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS EMPIRE IT`S STILL A VERY GOOD CD.THE SONG SIGN OF THE TIMES IS MY FAVORITE SONG.WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT QUEENSRYCHE IS THE WORDS.THIS CD IS VERY DEEP AND IS A GOOD LISTEN.MUST HAVE FOR QUEENSRYCHE FANS."
2,I didnt believe rock was dead until now,"Blame this one on Chris Degamaro. Thank god the rest of the band decided not to follow this path and instead release him from the band. This album has no feeling to it, no mood to it, and by golly no @ss to it, although I dont hate the songs its just theres only 1 queensryche and then theres a million other bands that could make H.I.T.N.F so im glad to see that they take theyre uniquiness seriously like I do and are getting back to theyre roots in Q2k."
1,Awful. .... Worthles. Useless.,"Do you want to really waste your time and money? Buy this album and listen to it. Queensryche were such a good band, as you can see if you listen to their back catalog. Geoff Tate can still wail, but the rest of the band must have thought this album was a joke. They put absolutely NO effort into writing songs, and it sounds like worthless grunge bands like Nirvana. I would much rather not have my ears molested by this garbage. Listening to this album makes me vomit incessantly. Oh, the last song, ""SpOOL"" is rather good, like the songs off ""Promised Land,"" but unless you're buying this at a really low price, it ain't worth having this CD take up any room in your house."
1,Horrible,This has got to be the worst cd ever put out in the world of metal. I am an avid fan of Queensryche up through Empire. I would give this album zero stars if I could. What happened to this band?
2,I'm a little dissapointed in this one,"Although I have fond memories of the day I bought this one (listening to it while driving down the California coast on Highway 1), it is easily their weakest effort. The only song that really stands out for me is ""The Voice Inside"". I would say that if you a fan, it's worth buying, but don't expect too much out of it."
1,AAARRRGGGHHH!!!,"Apart from ""spOOL,"" this album just isn't in step with Queensryche's other stuff. Someone might be able to enjoy it by blasting it at a party, but I always liked how Queensryche intrigued one. That element is sadly missing here."
2,Queenryche's Worst Album; Try Operation: Mindcrime or Empire,"Queensryche typically does outstanding music. Their lyrics are thoughtful; the drumming and singing particularly exceptional; the guitar work very respectable. When ""on"", their songs are among the most powerfully emotional available. However, they faltered here. This album is also well-written, but the music doesn't have the emotional intensity of their best efforts. Skip it; go back to their earlier work if you want to see them at their peak.If you have the opportunity to pick up a couple of tracks from this disc, try ""Reach"" and ""Inside Out."" The rest is forgettable.I'm a huge Queenryche fan, so it hurt to write this!"
5,V-2: A Combat History,"As stated by many reviewers, much has been written on the V2 rocket, but this title makes a significant addition to the history. Also important is the life behind-the-scenes of the troops on the ground who actually fired these weapons, and for a deeper understanding of that I recommend ""V2"" the novel, available on Kindle."
1,sohpmore slump yes indeed,"After a downsizing of crew, only two remained and from that came this LP. ""Godsound"" picks up on many of the topics that were from the 1st LP: religion, the last days, 1984 etc.Unfortunately, all of the songs that reflected these topics on the 1st LP were wack... so basically the entire 2nd LP reflects this. I received an advanced promo copy of this when it first came out and as the years have gone by I've tried to force myself to dig deeper into this album and let it grow on me. It still hasn't.If you can get the 1st LP... DO IT. The 1st album is dope, but not 5 stars dope as people make it out to be, but no doubt a dope CD."
3,Strong Underground,"This is an excellent c.d. for listeners who like the roots of hiphop mixed with a classic urban beat and positive christian flow. The BoogieMonsters would almost be a group you would consider underground, not mainstream, however they really represent a sound thats original. In a music world full of groups and individuals who attack society and lean on negativity to survive, this is one of the very few hiphop icons that take a different approach, worth checking out."
5,Excellent for the older woman,I was given this product as a birthday gift several years ago and loved the fragrance. It is a little heavy and is appropriate for the older woman to wear in the evening.
4,"A great example of ""now you see it, now you don't""","This is a before and after remix album based off madrigal dance numbers composed on midi based synthesizers, with the remix following the track in question. It's a monotone format that inspires the listener to rearrange the cd into new mixes. The actual madrigals are very solid and fun to listen to and the remixes sometimes don't resemble the original much at all, but are still interesting to listen to and some actually would work really well in the mix of the actual song. Mainly, this album shows me how different musical styles can be relatable if placed within certain contexts, as such this is a solid pop album, but one of a very whimsical nature."
3,strictly school,Very boring. I like the easy wayit reads. I wouldn't have bought it unless it wasn't necessary for school.
5,Excellent Liberty Introduction,"This is a great book. It was one of the first books I bought after reading Locke's second treatise on government and I would not sell it for anything. It gives the history, philosophy and vision of a liberty oriented society. It also shows how giving up liberty for security has made life much less enjoyable. Plus, It has lots of great quotes from C.S. Lewis and Ayn Rand to Mao Tse Tung and Washington. I have used the book extensively in writing papers, articles and in my pursuit of more knowledge. It even contains a reading list of books and pamphlets to continue your study, some of which are printed on the Internet. This one is worth buying at almost any price and now that it is out of print, it's probably worth more than you would pay for it. Happy reading!"
2,Stalin:A Time for Judgement,An introductory work; good for a high school class. I donated my copy to the local high school. I hope the students get a fresh perspective on what communism was like under a satanic dictator.
4,"Light, Predictable Fun","You know when you sit down with a Mary Kay Andrews novel that you're going to get a few laughs, some local color, and that everything will end well. Savannah Breeze is no exception, and was well worth the few days it took to read. BeBe Loudermilk gets shafted, then gets her revenge. She also gets her man, and I don't think I'm spoiling a plot point by saying that as soon as she met the ornery handyman at her new Tybee Island motel (and of course hated him on sight), I knew what would happen.I might have given the book a five just for the sheer fun of reading it, but the storyline was quite slim and unfortunately predictable. Even though I knew what twists were coming many pages before I actually encountered them, the ride was still a hoot. Long live BeBe Loudermilk!"
5,Loved this book,"I cannot say enough good things about this book...its imposible to put it down. Mary Kay Andrews has us Southern women pegged for sure. She will make you laugh out loud and often because the characters remind you of yourself or someone you know. If you love the south, and especially Savanah, you will LOVE this book.Oh yes....the story is interesting as well as funny. That's always important, isn't it ?"
2,TERRIBLY BORING,"I have read 3 other Mary Kay Andrews books - Hissy Fit, Savannah Blues, and Deep Dish. I really liked all three of those and finished them all in record time. This book, however, was so boring. There was nothing redeeming about it. The main character, BeBe, was insipid and shallow. The Weezie that we knew and loved from Savannah Blues was really just an afterthought. It seemed that MKA needed to have her in the story to tie the two together so instead of actually giving her some action, she decided to write odd chapters from Weezie's perspective. I really didn't like that. There was no romance in this book. I never got the idea that the characters even liked one another. Overall, I was disappointed."
1,Never received this items from the supplier,"I am sure this book would have been great, but I never received it, even tho the person I ordered it from says he mailed it"
4,Fun book,"I really like the books from Mary Kay Andrews, and then I remember why...I am a huge fan of Ms. Trocheck. (please bring back the housekeeping detectives!).Anyway, this is a fun book, and the only reason I gave it four is it was pretty predictable. But even with that, it is well worth the read, Ms. Andrews books are just plain fun."
5,Really Fun Read,This is a really fun read. It was especially fun for me since I am familiar with all the places she writes about in the book. I also love the references to Bahia Mar and to John D. MacDonald and his Travis McGee series. Gotta love a woman who appreciates JDM.This is one of MKA's best books. I really love this book and have read it twice (so far).
5,loved it,first book I read and now am hooked on reading all mary kay andrews. can't wait to read the rest of her books.
2,Okay,"I liked this book better than Savannah Blues (but not much better). It is a light read and maybe funny to some, but the plot was not realistic. I know this book received great reviews. However, I was disappointed. The characters annoyed me and they did not have any substance to them. I am not sure if I will read another book from this author."
3,a fun read,I thought this book was fun to read. There were many interesting characters and you really cared what happened to them.
1,Just awful,"I bought this book for a poolside read and while I expected it to be light and fun, it was so terrible I couldn't even finish it. Why this book has so many positive ratings is beyond me! Really, it's just awful. The characters are paper thin and full of cliches. The plot is entirely unbelievable. I didn't even like the main characters! They were certainly not relateable or a realistic portrayal of a modern woman. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money and find another summer read."
3,A disappointment-slow as molasses,"I expected a ""Southern Evanovich-type book."" I was wrong. Not a single chuckle in the first 50 pages. The author is a good writer, but gives too much description/background for my taste which made it laborious to read. Too much description, not enough action."
2,Prefer first reader,"I guess if you've never heard the reader on ""Savannah Blues"", Keating would probably be an okay reader. But the first book was such an incredible delight, and Bebe (""Bay-Bay"") was such a such a crisp-sharp character in every way, it's very disconcerting to have her edges ""blunted"" in this book.It's not just the common-ization of her name (from ""Bay-Bay"" down to the everyday ""Bee-Bee"") -- didn't Andrews even listen to this tape first? -- it's just that her feisty-ness has lost its superior air. And with that loss, she's just another character, certainly not the memorable one she was in the first book.It's an okay read, probably would have been much better had I not listened to ""Blues"" first.Sad. I was really looking forward to Book #2."
5,Exciting! Hard to put down!!,"Renovating, decorating, and taking back control of her life! This book a mix of romance, suspense, comedy, drama and dripping with southern charm! I read this book twice! Very hard to put down! This was my first M.K. Andrews book to read. With this book my nights of sleep were shortened. And I'm addict! I recommend reading Savannah Blues first."
5,Dating again .... with Murder,"Well this is my third Mary Kay Andrews book and I am hooked. I checked out this book on CD from my local library in the unabridged version. Too funny for words. I am a newer resident to Georgia and after listening to about 4 of the 11 CDs I was talking with a sultry ""BEBEE"" accent, sort of Southern sexy with 2 glasses of Wine. The story line kept me engaged and laughing all the way to and from work. I especially, enjoyed the dating sceens with Daniel.Can you believe it..... going out with out your [...]?Art Girl"
1,Not what I thought it would be,"What I wanted was three men seeking monsters. I wanted to red about six weeks in pursuit of Werewolves, Lake Monsters, Giant Cats, Ghostly Devil Dogs, and Ape-Men. What I got was a hundred pages of ""me and my mates knocking about the pubs and having a laugh"" before anything really happens. I wanted more cryptozoological searches and theories, less narrative about the author and his friends just hanging out."
2,Scooby Doo-ish activities,"This book is like sneaking into a graveyard at night, you find that, yes it is spooky, but nothing much exciting really occurs. I found the book to lack any revelation other than some tall tales I hadn't heard before, which Redfern seems to leave with the reader as the reward for buying his book. It's a light read and more about his two buddies hanging out with him drinking than any serious adventure. This would of been the type of adventure you probably would of liked to have had in college, so it's not unentertaining...but I would not see this as a must buy unless you feel Nick needs the donation."
1,I DON'T GET THE POINT,"Nothing against any of the artists featured here, but I don't understand the point of putting out these collections. I honestly think that unless these CDs are all done as a club mixes, this series is a complete waste of money. Most fans of these artists most likely have these recordings already on the artists' own CDs. I felt ripped off & I won't even look at another part of this series. These remind me of those dorky collections you see for sale on those cheap, late-night TV commercials. I'll just 'change the channel' next time. Shame on them!!!"
5,The everlasting challenge!,"The whole materialization of this book was due the kind permission of Scientific American based on a smart and very antique idea: to recreate and diffuse all kind of ingenious problems, challenging riddles and daring enunciates from the most lucid minds around the world. From the sagacious inventive of Lewis Carroll all kinds of creative problems will put you in action and magnificent good mental shape to resolve a wide gamut of several and clever problems.Geometry, elemental physics, advanced logic will defile and bet for its eventual resolution, through a series of funny stories and suggestive anecdotes as the famous device employed by Kant to set the appropriate time once his watch disarranged.The pleasant style of Martin Gardner in his role such master ceremony constitutes a splendid opportunity to let you to invade for the most astonishing and smart questions.Go for this!"
1,Stay away,"Terrible, plotless horror film about a jogger who is nearly beaten to death and kills everyone he sees once he wakes up. This isn't even fun for the gore because it's mostly done with computers and looks ridiculously fake. I think the fakeness might be intentional because at times the gore is more reminiscent of cartoons from the Monty Python TV show than anything you would see in an actual slasher film, but this thing gets monotonous fast. The Summer of Massacre is basically the equivalent of watching someone else play a video game for 90 minutes--it doesn't work as a gorefest or as a horror movie."
1,bad movie,This movie was so terrible that I watched it in disbelief. I kept waiting for it to improve and the only time it did was when the credits started. The CGI kills were child like and only served to remind me of how bad the movie was. The acting and dialogue were horrible but were better than the writing. I can't think of a single reason to watch this steaming pile of crap. Save your time and money and skip this waste of I don't know what.
1,Easy listening for Goths.,"First off this is not a ""Best Of"", it's a totally re-recorded (not remixed) effort (read effort, not accomplishment) by Hussey. Now while it is ""O.K."", it's not a good representation of ""The Mission"", all the power, presence and depth are gone from these songs.Basically it sounds as if someone (Hussey) took all ""The Mission"" songs and fed them through an easy listning machine. It's not mature, just boring.If you are a big fan of ""The Mission"" this might work for you, for alternate versions of the songs.For a new listiner STAY AWAY!!!. Get one of these albums instead ""The First Chapter"", ""Children"" or ""Gods Own Medicine"".O.K. I'm done."
3,Best of? No! Remix or reproduced? Yes!,"As another reviewer pointed out these are not the original releases. I don't know if I would consider this a pure remix as much as I would consider the songs reproduced with slight differences. If you are Mission UK fan I would actually recommend this just because they are different versions.To me the most disappointing part of this CD is that in no way could it be considered a best of. I was turned on to Mission UK many years ago because of the ""Tower of Strength"" video on 120 Minutes on MTV. Any best of would definitely have to include ""Tower of Strength"".If you are even a marginal Goth fan I would recommend Children instead of this CD. Ironically I find that Mission UK songs stand the test of time better than Sisters Of Mercy songs and I am a big Sisters fan."
5,What Could Be Better?,It's the Mission... I gave this as a gift to someone who hadn't listened to the Mish for nearly 18 years. This was a great refreshed and intro to the things he had missed. Anyone who may be interested in a general course on the Mission might be interested in this. Any hardcore fans will have no need for this as it is redundant of previously released tracks - nothing limited to this album.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD,"This IS NOT a best of The Mission UK. Don't get ripped off by this collection from Cleopatra. I did get ripped off. I'll never buy another product from Cleopatra. Shame on you Cleopatra! (the Label) They tell you it's a Best Of, but they are ALL very (VERY) lame remixes. They do not remotely sound like the same songs, or even The Mission UK. The packaging does not say these are remixes.Intead, buy something else such, as Sum and Substance."
3,Need stronger outer layer,"Our puppy is having fun with this toy but it needs a stronger outer layer. We have had about two weeks and she has pulled a third of the pink top layer on one side but so far has not been able tear the second layer. Unfortunately she only gets to play with it while we watch so she does not eat the fabric. She is a shredder girl she bites and pulls the fur off of other toys as well, if you have something stronger please let me know."
1,waste of money,"My dog destroyed this toy within minutes. she isnt gentle with toys, but it lasted just as long as a stuffed animal would. i wouldnt waste the money because this toy isnt going to last...."
1,Not so Tough Tuffie,I have a 13 month old Airedale Terrier. She ripped holes in this product and pulled out the stuffing in about thirty minutes.
1,terrible toy,"It took my 20 pound, 7 month old beagle puppy under 10 minutes to destroy this toy. He instantly went right for the seam and was able to lift and tear it off. He did seem to love this tough but after he ripped off the seam and began to eat it, I had to take it away."
2,Okay for Inside play - not outside,"Thick, squeeky, fun toy for indside play - I guess.Look elsewhere if you want one to throw and catch outside........."
1,Don't buy this,"Horrid product, unsafe for pets, falls apart in minutes. Don't waste your money or put your dog at risk."
5,A Great Toy from A Better Company,"To see a full review of this product, visit: http://dogshopper.blogspot.comI spend a lot of time reviewing dog toys and I have to say that the Tuffy line is a perennial favorite. The ring flies well. Is good to tug with and a joy for the dog to carry! Lots of dog love to carry things when they run. It helps to tire them out. What I like best about this toy is how soft it is on the dog's mouth. Regular frisbees and even some dog discs are made of such rigid material that it can be uncomfortable or even damaging to a dog's mouth. It can also be painful to be on the receiving end of these hard plastic discs when your dog is running it back to you at full speed. The Tuffy ring is soft and bendy, so it doesn't hurt when it slams into your leg or when you are tugging with your dog (I've broken a lot of fingernails tugging with frisbees and I don't have long nails). I think the Tuffy rings are great for dogs old and young. Lots love fun and very durable!"
2,Not so tough,"My 1 year old mini dachshund has tore through two of these types of toys (one boomerang and one round). The end seams are very well constructed; however, he tares through the middle part that is not reinforced. He loves the challenge this toy offers, but for the money, it's not worth the few hours it takes him to chew a hole through."
2,"not so ""tuff"" after all","this toy lasted longer than most plush toys, so i'll give it that. however wasn't as tough as i hoped. see pic above. would be good as a monitored toy like someone else mentioned, but left to the chewers devices, it will be destroyed!"
2,Not so Tuff,"Our 11 month old schnoodle tore through this in about an hour. It was more of a challenge for him than many toys, but but he was up to the job. Does anyone make a Kevlar dog toy?"
5,One tough toy,This is the second one we bought and has far outlasted any other toy. We do take it away from the dog when he goes into a serious chewing mode.
5,Ours lasted 5 months,"Our one year old Pomeranian/American Eskimo puppy is a very energetic player who LOVES stuffing, and any regular stuffed animal has been ripped apart in less than a minute. However, when our puppy learned he couldn't rip this apart very easily, he stopped trying! He loves all the squeakers, and he loves to put his little face in the hole and playing chase with you after you throw it. It has definitely been his most durable and favorite toy over all his bones, balls and squeaky toys (right next to his kong frisbee). The toy finally met its demise when he discovered the end of the binding and got a string loose after working on it for a week or two. It was a slow demise - he ripped it and chewed on it on and off for about two months before we deemed it unsafe. However, we plan on buying another one right away since it was so durable during that 5 month time. Really liked this toy!"
3,Good Donut,"My dogs are very tough on toys, and they did not tear this one up immediately, which is great. It throws like a frisbee in the house but is soft so there is no damage."
4,Tuff enuf,"None of the toys I bought for a dog chew were indestructible, but this one comes close. Kept the dogs entertained for days"
2,Bad Quality.,Bad Quality.Broke during shipment. Had to great a replacement.Replacement was a breeze though with Amazon.
4,tight Jam from King Kellz,"the regular version from R.Kelly is cool,but the re-mix is the truth. He was hitting that note and paid Babyface and toni braxton a tribute with the Babyface penned ""Breath again"" which he wrote and Produced on Braxton back in the day. well Arruh does his vocal run on it and on the re-mix knocks it out. Props always to the Kang Of R&B and you ain't ever gonna hear about R.kelly suing fans or acting wack toward folks. he always keeps it real."
3,A good jazzy christmas with a few skippers,"What recommends this compilation most are two terrific vocals of two rarely heard, unusal christmas songs: Steve Allen's ""Cool Yule"" and Jack Fox's ""Zat You Santy Claus?"" (the only scary Christmas song!). Also a mean jazz guitar arrangement of ""Youre a Mean One Mr. Grinch.""So this cd gets points for interesting selections. Unfortunately, there are a couple of skippers, most notably, Judi Silvano's syrupy, broadway-singing-style, campy version of the admittedly cloying song, ""I'd Like You For Christmas.""But if you you like your Christmas jazzy, this is fun for the rotation."
4,inspiring and refreshing,"I had a little difficulty getting through the first few chapters, but I'm glad I kept on. I found Garvin to be an annoying and frustrating character who overreacts to ""problems"" most people wouldn't even consider problems. She struck me as a whiny, spoiled city-girl, but I think Ms. Foster did a wonderful job portraying her character growth. The story is mainly Garvin's story, about her journey home and spiritual growth along the way. I found Meemaw, Garvin's grandmother, a delightful character that everyone can find inspiring. I really enjoyed watching the relationships between both Garvin and Meemaw and Garvin and Monique (a lonely child she is ""mentoring"") develop. Parts of the book are very predictable, and there seems to be so many climaxes in Garvin's character that one begins to wonder when, and if, she will ever really ""see the light."" Besides that, I felt it to be a really refreshing read."
4,Excellent storyline,"Gavin is a controlling and determine character with her friends, family, job and herself. Gavin came with issues that needed resolving and in the end she provided help to others that in turned helped herself.Meemaw, is the woman of the hour. Meemaw words of encouragement and words from God was a gift to Gavin and others. GOGO, the ex-pro football player, was just a new awakening. Smitty and Big Esther were just the pair.This author dealt with personal and career issues that were very thought provoking. The spiritual guidance that was given to all the characters were soul stirring and healing. This author is one to keep looking out for.Sharon, keep giving the reader the message of love and especially what God has and can give one's life. I'll just wait on the next book, because your writing is a clean and fresh breath of air."
3,ok,"This is the story of Gavin, who goes back to her home town to make sure she is not being taking advantage of by GoGo, the young man her grandmother has sudden starting hanging out with. I didn't really care that much for the main characther, Gavin at first, she seemed stuck up, and shallow. What I liked about this book is the scriptures that were included."
3,"Some parts good, some not","I liked the idea of one son refusing to participate in the quest for an item to win the bride. By staying home he got to know her and won her over that way, even though he wasn't planning to. Most of it was a nice story, but there were times I wished the story were over. I even skimmed a few pages. The conflict that caused her to leave him toward the end was an incorrect assumption on her part. I was diasappointed that the author couldn't come up with something better to create conflict. Sexual content: moderate."
1,"Totally illogical, I'm afraid","There's a good story in it somewhere I'm sure, but really! I think the editor must be asleep to miss the big gaping holes in the plot:(a) The hero spends time tending the orchard. In winter.(b) The castle is raided by knights obviously out for bloodlust and to pillage and plunder. Our dear heroine charges into the room in all her finery to confront these men. Alone. And shudder because eyes were on her beautiful swoonsome body."
3,Short on the wrist,"While these gloves fit well and seem to have decent protection, they are a little short to protect the wrists and the small velcro strap doesn't serve much purpose in tightening them down. I could see them coming off in a crash, so I'm looking at sewing on some additional velcro to allow me to fasten them a little tighter."
3,"I Love DDR Music, But..","I found this album to be kind of hit or miss..I believe another reviewer mentioned that some of the songs were cheesy or campy and I have to agree with that. Legitimately, the only reason I have this CD is that I really want to have all the albums collected as it seems that Dance Dance Revolution is kind of dying out in the states.Don't get me wrong, some of the songs are great and some of the megamixes are okay, but I don't know that I need two CDs worth of cheesy music (and really, I love most DDR stuff) and video game sounds, however.. this seems to be par for course with these CDs, so it is simply something you must endure.Most of the music is still worth listening to and it is definitely okay to have as background noise when you have to do work or something else you might consider boring. Kind of spices things up. However, I wouldn't buy this unless you really like the track listings or are really dedicated (like me) to owning all of the CDs you can get your hands on."
2,Poor Performer,"This card took several tries to get it installed in windows xp pro. The setup that comes on the CD has to be run in win2k compatibility mode. After several attempts the card installed and would constant drop connection. Tried everything in the FAQ's. Changed channels, changed PCI slots, and manually set speed. It never had above good whereas my linksys WUSB11 v2.6 works with excellent signal on the same pc on the same channel. Good luck to anyone trying this product. My wireless router is WRT54.g"
1,Can't Keep Signal,"I just bought a 3G Compaq computer with a pentium4 processor. It came with Vista Home on it. First off, the adapter instuctions tell you to go to the Linksys website to download the driver for Vista. If I could do that, then I wouldn't need an adapter! I tried to download the vista driver to a CD on another computer and then load that CD on to my computer. I tried for 4 days and never did figure out how to do it. I finally paid $88.00 to have it done. The card now works for a few minutes and then I'm told that my computer has no network. My son's computer has another brand of card in it and it never has a problem. I've invested too much time and money to put up with this crraap."
3,Works better with native XP wireless LAN management,"Although the UI looks slick, their start-up software didn't work for my Dell box. It wasn't obvious how to connect to an unbroadcasted SSID, for example, if I just followed the ""next"" buttons per their brief instructional sheet. Then for whatever reason it failed to get a DCHP ""handshake"" that supposedly sets up everything like an IP and gateway and subnet masks and so forth. I gave up and relinquished control to the XP Lan manager, typed in the SSID, WEP key, and the thing worked after about 10 seconds. In contrast, just to give a perspective, my Netgear wireless adapter worked fine without going through all this. Moral of the story, if any, is probably these guys should just stick to firmware and leave the software to Microsoft."
1,Piece Of Junk!!,"The Linksys WMP54G is a piece of junk. I purchased one recently for a two year old Dell desktop running Win2K. The drivers that came in the box would not load, so I let the OS finsih the install without loading drivers then used Window's update function to add them. Windows still didn't like the drivers, but I forced them through and the device changed status to Code 10, Cannot Start. Linksys tech support, which is in India, was less than helpful, assuring me it was a bad PCI slot. Removed the card and installed into a brand new Gateway desktop running XP Pro. Exact same problem. Read some reviews and did some research, then threw the Linksys product in the trash and purchased a Netgear WG311 wireless PCI adapter. Installed correctly the first try in the Win2K machine and took < 2 minutes to configure with my SSID and WEP key. Price is the same and the Netgear product works as advertised. The moral...DON'T BUY LINKSYS"
1,Bad Installation and Linksys Customer service,"Could not get the card to work properly with any level of consistency. OS is Win98SE with AMI Bios. Bios would recognize the board and assign an IRQ but Wlan monitor would indicate card inactive. Attempt to call Linksys Customer service and was informed to 1st update Bios (it is at recent), no help at all. 2nd call I was emailed a firmware upgrade for the router (WRT45G) and a prior version of the driver (Sometimes, older drivers actually do work, but not this time), ver 1.2. No luck. Amazon replaced the card with no questoins asked, but the new card performed the exact same way. No level of driver/irq/Bios tweaking was able to get the card to run. I am very disappointed with Linksys and Cisco.I am considering replacing the entire setup with DLink."
1,Linksys = Bad Driver Software + Poor Tech Support,"Tried to install this card on my old PC. Box said driver could run on WIN98se. Crashed my PC before the installation was completed. Tried wired card after that, same kind of crap. The technical support is practically non-existent. Returned them and bought D-Link - works like a charm. Conclusion: Linksys is not a trustworthy brand."
4,G wireless,Works well. Just snap it into a PCI slot after installing the software first and it just works. Of course you need to give it a WEP code if you want a secure wireless connection. If the signal it receives is weak it makes a big difference when you turn your computer sideways a little.
2,Doesn't work if you have windows 7,"I'm reviewing this from the perspective of someone that's running Windows7. The drives that come with the router and on the Cisco website are not compatible with Win7 64bit. I tried downloading the chipset drivers direct from Rainlink but had no success with those either, but it seems that has helped some people if you are experiencing difficulty."
1,does not work in my computer,I thought that it would be a universal adapter and my computer ports are all on the left side of this right sided adaptor. Would have been nice to know that it wasn't universal.
1,Constantly disconnects,"I have 3 laptops that never, ever lose connectivity to my router - so don't go blaminig my problem on that! But his card? OMG Let's just put it this way, I have my 128bit passcode memorized because I use it DAILY!!! Yes, I've downloaded the latest driver. Yes, I've changed all the settings as suggested. Yes, I've tried everything suggested. It's just a piece of junk. And according to Linksys blogs, other cards for towers have similar problems. Linksys just lost a loyal customer."
5,excellent throughput,"Bought this wireless pci card to network in combination with linksys wireless-g access point.Initial setup was not particularly intuitive, but excellent customer support had me networked in around 20 minutes after install.I am anxiously awaiting the release of the WET54G wireless-g ethernet bridge."
5,Better than advertised!,"I set this network up in my home (and I know NOTHING about networking), and it works so well you wouldn't even know it's there. It is fast and reliable! My neighbor saw it and we got him set up too!"
1,Poor Quality and Support from Linksys.,"I just received on 07/06/04 my WMP54G that I purchased here from Amazon.com. The product was well packed, and when it arrived it was brand new condition and it looked to be fresh from Linksys. When I opened it up, and followed the instructions for Windows XP which is pretty easy, the brass connector that you screw the antenna on on the back of the PCI came off. It looks like that small SMA connector is pressed into the card, not soldered, and it can't hold the weight of the antenna. I called Linksys and asked if this was a known problem and they said no, and they made excuses that it was my fault. I got an RMA from them and I am sending it back. I should have ordered the USB one, but I figured this would be better. I would never purchase this type item again!"
1,bad software bad documentation,"Don't waste time on this one if running XP home. It wouldn't correctly install the newest driver available on the Linksys web site so I had to do it manually (repeatedly.) Once the card was actually recognized, the supposed setup wizard still refused to run. There are 3 wireless networks in my area but it would only recognize my if I input the name maunally in network settings. I altered every last possible setting manually on the card and on my Linksys G router but no go, the card would recognize that the network existed but refused to connect. Bottom line, buy anyone elses!"
5,easy to install and use on windows 7,"This PCI wireless card is easy to install and use. I just popped it in an empty PCI slot, installed the drivers (included in CD), and I was good to go. In the past, I was using a USB wireless adapter. The best signal I received was 3/5 bars. But this card gets 5/5 bars! I'm very happy with this product."
4,"Simple, clean, easy, affordable","This device worked just as well as I expected from Linksys. It installed without issue, keeps good signal, and has not had any interruption issues so far. I used it on a build for an old roomate. The only issue I have with it is it does not support N, only G, which is fine for most but not me. If I could get one for cheap with N I'd have one in my system as well. Good solid product, reasonable price."
1,"Terrible Mechanicals, poor winXP integration",This card is an extreme departure from my experience with many other Linksys products which have been uniformly positive in my experience.This card is very poorly made - the antenna mount is press fit together and *very* fragile. The antenna is also a fragile construction all on its own. The lack of drivers/management utility that work well with windows XP really stinks.The units I purchased were returned and Belkin PCI cards were purchased instead. These have a solid construction plus a driver/utility that makes reliable connections in windows XP.
4,"Good performance, no surprises.","Installed without hassles, and has very informative and user-friendly network connection software. No surprises."
1,This card [is no good],It doesn't work. I have 2 dell desktops at home (8100 and 8200). I tried this card on both and got the same error message - cannot start (code 10) or something like that. I've been reading up on Linksys' Wireless-G stuff and it looks like they are selling products that are half-baked. I'm gonna give them a few weeks to straighten this out or I'll send it back. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
1,Bad Product,"Unless you have system restore, do not purchase this product, because you will probably be needing it. Multiple crashes, driver failures, and when finally installed, unable to communicate with its mother router. I don't know why my problems were so extreme - however, I am unable to understand how anyone got this to work properly - I'm no idiot either.Tech support is NON EXISTENT ! If you email, you will get instructions to go to a fague link that tells you nothing !!!Save your money, and wire your house for ethernet - wireless is a waste of money."
1,Not needed,"I bought this card as I assumed I needed it. I purchased it with a router, card for my son's laptop, and xbox360 adaptor.My son is an IT student and hooked everything up pronto.The problem I have is everything went through my computer and modem prior to getting to the router. There was absolutely no need for the card for my computer.I'm no computer genius, but it seems to me that a little more clarity as to the need of this product would be nice.Your base unit doesn't need it. Only ""additional"" computers require it.I really cant' ""rate it"" as I have never used it. The rest of the stuff works great.Live and learn. :("
1,DOA G-Wireless,"Used this card to replace a Linksys WUSB54G Wireless-G USB Adapter that had start to act up on me. I was going to install a 5 port USB PCI hub so I figured, ""Why not ditch the corded adapter while I'm cracking the case?"".No dice. The card never worked. I made sure that I grounded my self before installing. I was on the phone w/ Linksys Tech Support for an hour and we repeated the same driver install dance that you normally go through on these sort of calls.My computer uses the latest version of XP and is a pretty decent system that's about 4 years old. P4, 2 GHz, 1024 MB of ECC Registered Memory. Yada, yada, yada.I finally returned the Linksys card and got a D-Link PCI adapter. It's worked fine since then though it doesn't have the range of my old USB adapter. I think I'll stick with Belkin wirelss products from now on."
1,Stay away if you have older hardware,"Got one of those, and even after a month trying I couldn't get it working properly with older hardware (Celeron, P2, P3). It has been reported by several users that this card has issues with Intel BX/ZX chipsets, once you plug the card the system does not boot at all. Linksys support was useless solving this issue."
3,"Slow, but works","Setup was easy and flawless when instructions were followed (run CD, install adapter, reboot and finish setup). The adapter works but is slower than a much cheaper ethernet adapter or even a USB wireless adapter I bought for a cheaper price. For the price, it should be faster or more versatile."
2,Wireless Adaptor,This wireless adaptor simply isn't very good. I paired it with both a wireless N and G router and in both instantances i got very poor connection quality. I ended up just using a WDS setup which i don't care for because of the limited security options. However a second router in the same spot as this wireless adaptor yeilded such better connection quality i simply have to use it. I am very disappointed i bought this card and it is now in the closet collecting dust.
5,Simplistic,This product was very easy to install and used. The hardest thing was opening the computer to install the card.
5,Easy to install - harder to use,"This Wireless adapter was a snap to install. I installed this in my Windows XP system, and it took only a few minutes to install. Honestly, it took me longer to get the computer out from under the desk than to install.Once the software and drivers were installed, the challenge of the software began. To connect to a wireless network, you have to chase down the little green Linksys box, click here, click there, and hold your tongue just right. Not horrible, but not intuitive. I ended up switching to the Windows wireless configuration software for the ease of use."
5,Easy Install!,I received this adapter for my extra desktop and easily installed the card and had it working within 10 minutes.
3,Works ok for me,"I purchased a WMP54G for my parents computer to avoid running cable through their house. The first one worked well for about a year when it suddenly received no signal - acted like the antenna connection was bad - possibly due to rearrangement of cords, etc. behind the computer. A replacement card has worked flawlessly ever since from a second story office to wireless router in the basement."
4,Affordable and managable home networking w/ Linksys...,"Just got my 54G PCI card & it works great. I absolutely love it and it has had no problems working w/ my current 802.11B Linksys wireless router. Going to upgrade to the 54G router from Linksys later. Just plugged the card into my computer and away we went w/ instant wireless internet/intranet access. Took no time in setting up the 128bit encyption & was very easy! The only thing I am having a problem w/ is setting up my network printer, but I think that has something to do w/ on my end. Gr8 deal for sixtyninebux w/ free shipping! Would highly recommend it. Right now the router is approx 100ft away w/ approx 6 walls between the antennae and router (works great!) Also Linksys tech support is awesome and patient."
1,Consistently BAD drivers and installation,"To provide a little insight, I am an IT professional with over twenty years of experience in programming and PC support. With that said, I have spent countless hours trying to get this card to work in a pretty normal PC setup using Windows XP SP2. I have several networked computers in the house, and of all the routers and wireless cards I have encountered over the years, this is hands-down THE WORST card I have ever used.If you lose your driver disk, you might as well throw the card away. You will search forever and never find installation software that works. CISCO owns Linksys, and you just won't find support for the card.I don't even know how long I've spent trying to get this piece of crap to work again. I'm going down to the local PC dealer and buying an off-brand card. And I am otherwise a FAN of Linksys, but I'd rather gouge my eyes out than spend one more minute fighting with this card."
5,Plug and play on MAC!,Zero installation hassles. Shows up just as an airport card would. Great product to get the old G4 connected without the wires. Reccommended.
1,Unstable Junk,Do not buy this card. It will break on you within 6 months if you ever get it to work properly. This is my second card both have failed with the dreaded (will not start code 10) error within 6 months of purchase.
2,Linksys WMP54G Wireless-G PCI Adapter,seemed to have worked well.hear and there r connection issues on an emachine but takes a few restarts then will work
1,Absolute Rubbish!,"This card worked for about 3 weeks then quit. I'm experienced at setting up networks and did everything possible to resurrect this card, short of shaking chicken feathers over it while dancing a jig. As per message that popped up on the Linksys screen, ""you are connected to the access point, but the internet can't be found."" I was connected, but could not go on the internet! HUH? A rather odd message, since that is what most people would like to do with a network card. If you go on the Linksys forums, you will see MANY people with the exact same problem. Shame on Linksys for putting forth such a piece of junk. I wasted two days of my life trying to get this thing running again. I'm off to buy from Hawking."
1,Never could get it to work with Windows 2000,"Attempting to get the Linksys WMP54G PCI wireless card to work on a desktop computer running Windows 2000 was an exercise in frustration. After four sessions talking with Linksys customer support (at least it's a toll-free number, hence 1 star) and another session using on-line chat, I have given up. Linksys never was able to help me get this card working. The principal problem was that it inevitably made the computer hang. No amount of troubleshooting made a difference. Apparently, it seems to work for XP users, but I would not recommend this card for anyone using Windows 2000. I returned it."
3,PC wifi adapator,No problems installing this card (XP home edition) in an older Dell PC the software that came in the package worked perfect. However out of the box the antenna was broken loose at the base to the female connector. I pushed the antenna back into it's mounting base and taped the pieces together---working great. Amazon delivered fastern than I had expected---very good service--price was better than E-Bay. Jim H.
4,easy install works great.,"easy install works great.For security, always turn your router MAC filter ON to only allow the specific machines in your local network to access your router."
3,Still No Windows 7 Support? Lolz,"I bought this card years ago for another PC (Ubuntu installation...tricky but I got it working) but I decided to use it for my Windows 7 64-bit PC recently. After 3 days of trying different Railtek drivers in attempts to get this working, I gave up. If you are looking to buy to use in a Windows 7 box, look elsewhere. You have been warned. Still, for what it's worth, my pre-Windows 7 use was a favorable experience."
2,Hardware Easy to Install - Not so easy to get it to work!,"I am still trying to use this on a Win7 64-bit system, and it was a huge pain. First of all the drivers on the CD and on the Linksys web page are not updated.the connection that you get, either with linksys drivers or with the chipset manufacturer drivers won't be reliable. The only difference between performance with drivers is that with the CD or linksys web page drivers your connection will go from 0kbps to 500 kbps, but the peaks of high speed will be short, and with the chipset manufacturer your speed will go from 0kbps to 1mbps, the peaks of high speed will be longer, but still the connection won't be reliable. So why buy something that won't be providing the function that you bought it for ?"
1,Won't Work in XP,"Despite the claims, this device would not work in my XP computer. The driver provided is not compatible with XP and caused system malfunctions. I was never able to get the device to communicate with the router. I spent almost an hour on the phone with LINKSYS tech support ( he assured me that the driver that came with the card would work with XP ). For some unknown reason, in the middle of trying to work out the problem, I was disconnected from the tech and placed on hold. After about a minute another LINKSYS tech answered. He had no idea what I was talking about and the tech I had been working with had apparently not logged my call - we would have to start all over again he said. My reply was no we won't - I am returning the card and I will go through the trouble of hard wiring the PC to the router. LINKSYS gets a thumbs down on this one. Someone should tell them there are alot of people out there using Windows XP."
1,"Easy to install, awful performance","I just got the adapter with the wireless dsl router. I had little trouble installing the router and adapter (on windows 2000 machine), just had to find the right cable connecting to the dsl modem, and only got a BLUE SCREEN once. I was exciting for 2 mins after connecting to the wireless router but then my connection dropped. I was then able to establish connection but only got 1Mbs. I have my dsl router in the living while the PC is on the second floor. So now I guess I will just run the wire from the second floor to the living room.I'm glad I got the router and the adapter from amazon so I can easily return it."
2,Poor speed with Windows XP,"Installed OK, but speed was terrible with security enabled. Only marginally better with it disabled. I would recommend rather go with ""Netgear MA311 Wireless PCI Card"" for windows XP. The Linksys PCMCIA cards are great."
1,"My two cents on the ""horrible product"" side","The polarization of reviews here is startling. There appears to be NO operating system or configuration that works consistently. The lucky few who had no problems just seem blessed.My experience is in the horror story side. I (stupidly) didn't do research and purchased the WMP54G. I have now spent 4 days working with two machines and have not had a successful install of both the adapter and the monitor.As others have found, phone tech support are some of the most un-informed I've encountered. I can't comment on email, as I haven't received any response. The ""knowledge base"" online is just a re-purposed copy of their inadequate manuals. There is no attempt to publish problems and work-arounds that people have reported.I have spent way more time on this than it is worth, but I can't believe there is no way to make it work. I imagine I will soon get tired of banging by head against a wall and return all this Linksys junk."
1,Problems with XP SP1a & SP2,"I tried installing this on an Athlon XP running a brand-new clean install of XP Service Pack 2.XP comes up and says it has a new ""network adapter"" but will not accept the drivers on the Linksys disk. Running the Linksys disk by itself fails, as the Linksys setup program crashes.Manually selecting the drivers sometimes (??) works, but after about 5 mintues the card stops working and after a few ""repair connection"" operations, WIndows disables the card. And it won't work again until you uninstall and reinstall the drivers.Some on the net believe that some of this behavior is due to a ""common"" wireless pakcage MS introduced in XP SP1a, and before that as a critical Hotfix. Maybe, but it seems to be more that this card just sux.BTW, I've been dealing with computers since 1971."
4,So far so good,"I had no complains so far about this Wireless adapter, it has a good range and it's easy to install. I will review this comment in a few months but so far so good..."
1,Stinks,"Ever since Cisco bought Linksys, product quality has gone straight downhill. Manufacturing quality has gone all plastic, all lights, software and such is downscaled and up went the price. Thank you Cisco. I hope the CEO pf Ciso is enjoying his ill gotten gains.the item never worked properly, and it seemed to be that you have to install the software first then install the item. then is struggles to get a signal and the fight is never worth the results"
4,Great Wireless-G Card,"If you run a home network in your house you should definetly be using the Linksys-WRT54GL, and if you are using that then you should probably be using this Wireless-G card. Works great!"
5,Great Technology,Didn't know this product existed until one of our IT Techs mentioned it. Works great for those old computers that don't have an internal modem.
1,JUNK! Save your money! USB instead!,"My old linksys wireless-B PCI card worked great. But the linksys replacement wireless-G version got inadaquate reception from the exact same location! If you want linksys wireless-G, purchase the linksys USB version [WUSB54G]. It resolved my issue! ;-)~"
2,A Clinic in Self-Immolation,"I've set up 3 Linksys wireless adapters now -- two of these and oneLinksys WPC54GS Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SpeedBoosterto work with myLinksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster. The first one of these and the Notebook Adapter had serious issues in handshaking with the router and required significant time on the phone with Linksys to set up, and I'm still not completely happy with their functionality.Surprisingly, this second WMP54G that I installed had no issues whatsoever, and setup was a breeze. Too bad it only lasted 3 weeks before ""frying"" itself.Am waiting now on a replacement from Linksys."
2,pretty good... but not really,"This is a good piece of equipment when it works... when it isn't working it is sometimes the buggiest internet connection ever. Maybe its the combo that sucks... I have an airport express wireless router by apple, since I have a couple mac laptops in my house, and my desktop (a hp media center m7750n) is a door down the hall. I never get 5 bars... sometimes it just doesn't work... and sometimes i get a message that says access: local only which just means im so close yet so far away from internet connection. Do not buy this product unless you're very patient."
4,Wireless PCI adapter,"I bought this for my new desktop computer that I just moved from my upstair den to downstair bedroom. In order not to pull the cable around the house, I add this to the desktop to work wirelessly.The installation is a easy snap, and it takes no time to get it going. I do noticed the small slowdown on the speed, specially when I play on-line games. For the tradeoff, I can live with it."
1,Doesnt Work with XP,"This product doesnt work with MY XP installation and Linksys tech support cant help.Due to having faith that Linksys would fix the problem i cant even return it to Amazon as it is over the 30 day return limit.1 Useless bit of kit i a box in mint condition.When I put it in my machine event the wired LAN connection fails.I bought the Linksys 54G router and PCMCIA card at the same time and these work great on a laptop running XP, so I know how to set it up.Thanks Amazon and Linksys - between you you have cost me a lot of money for an ornament!!"
1,Awful,This is the worst networking prodict I have ever had. I highly do NOT reccomend it. I would reccomend the WUSB54G. (It uses a USB port.)
1,Wrong item was sent,Wrong item. Was not what was pictured. It's a router. Not a wireless adapter. Wrong item. Was not what was pictured. It's a router. Not a wireless adapter. Wrong item. Was not what was pictured. It's a router. Not a wireless adapter.
4,Good product,"Easy to install...when you follow the directions. You MUST install the software first, and then install the card. When you open the box, there is enough documentation to alert you to do so. It is really hard to screw up this installation.I was expecting a better connection than what it gets. I get a good connection from the computer I installed it in. The machine is on the second floor of my home, and the router is on the first floor. I was expecting a better connection, but overall, it suits my needs. Would definitely recommend it for the price. This card costs double in other retail outlets."
3,Performance is intermittent,"I purchased two of these along with a WAP54G access point. I have a Cisco 806 router configured with DHCP at the core of my home network. The problem I had was that BOTH cards would regularly disconnect and reconnect to the network even though signal strength was excellent. The problem went away when I hard configured the cards with their IP addresses rather than obtain them from the router. By the way, both cards were installed into Windows XP SP2 machines."
3,Avoid if you're running 64 bit windows 7,This Adapter worked great in windows XP but was awful when I migrated my computer over to Windows 7 64 bit. Luckily I was able to find some workarounds online that allowed me to get it installed but if I ever make any changes to my system I have to re-do everything over again. If you're not very tech savvy and are running Windows 7 64 bit look forward to tons of headaches. Luckily I still had my iPhone to download the drivers for the card with.
5,"Works, great","I purchased this for an older second computer that didn't have wireless networking capabilitiy. Installed in minutes, works great."
4,No surprises,"Everything worked as advertised: just followed the instructions in the box, and it was smooth sailing."
4,It works.,"I've had to re-setup twice, in the past month, but it's easy enough to do, and I don't know whether that was caused by the adapter or my modem/router, which has its own problems."
2,Watch the antenna,While easy to install and setup the antenna on this unit needs to be improved. I've had two and they both broke off when bumped.
5,Works Perfectly - Follow the instructions,"I installed my new Linksys WMP54G in about 10 minutes time. It works perfectly. When I opened the box, there were different sets of instructions, for each different type of Operating System. I picked up the Instructions for Windows XP. Depending on what version of Windows you are running, you will either install the software first, or the hardware first. It's in the directions! The XP directions called for me to 1) Power Off2) Insert the card and 3)Power on the computer, and THEN insert the CD software. In ten minutes it was running!The only problem I had was that I had to swtich the slot that the network card was installed in, because my tower did not like the first slot I choose. This was no fault of the Linksys card.I plan to order up three more of these for my other computers, and ditch the cables!"
1,Better Wait On 802.11g,"Had it running for a short time with not much luck. 802.11g has the same interference problems as 802.11b, as it will fight cordless phones, etc. I had the WAP in one room and the PC in the other. Connections would take a long time and would fail periodically. The fastest speed it would connect at, only two rooms away was 24Meg. Sometimes it would connect at 36Meg but quickly drop back down, sometimes to 10Meg. Someone around my house is running an unsecured WLAN as the card in my PC would get a week signal and pick up in IP address from somewhere else. Oops. I had to configure the PC end to look for my network only. If you follow Linksys's instructions, it will us the default configuration, which is wide open, and leave your network assessable to anyone around you. I soon tired of messing with it and got an RMA and shipped it back. I'll wait for 802.11a's prices to come down or see what new wireless protocol comes out next week."
5,Out of box Ubuntu support,"I'm running Ubuntu 5.10 on a Dell Optiplex GX150. The WMP54G card was recognized as ra0 and started working after WAP details were input, with no updated drivers or changes required. I configured, activated and set ra0 as default gateway, from the wireless admin tool (no command-line required). I'm using it with a WAP54G access point.(Don't bother with the included CD and directions, which are intended for Windows.)"
1,Financial abuse,"Just wanted to say that although I dont doubt the helpfullness of this book, I didnt find that it contained what I was looking for at all. The reason being that I was very interested in reading about financial abuse to help me overcomesome issues that I had. I would have expected at least a chapter on this considering that the book title says that it's a 'powerful conversation about truth and healing from physical, emotional...and financial abuse'. I'm afraid I was disappointed. There was only one sentence on financial abuse and it took me ages to find that!"
1,Abridged version -- accept no substitutes!,"Imagine my disappointment upon finding out that this long-awaited DVD is just an 85-minute ABRIDGED version of the glorious 94-minute version I saw with an enthusiastic crowd as part of the ""Midnight Madness"" programme of the 2007 Toronto Film Fest.My full review available at IMDB, under the title, ""Best B-Movie Since BOUND."" In it, I marvel at how tight the movie is ... how it never drags. Shortening it can ONLY lessen it, and if the black joke with the dog is gone, it's not even the same movie.There IS a great Stuart Gordon movie titled STUCK in the can someplace. I suggest you hold out until it gets released. It's a travesty to have butchered the version I saw."
2,What a shame...,I have never seen a movie with such potential be so completely ruined by the director. There are some very unecessary and lame things in this film that truly detract from what it could have been. The screenwriter should be furious.
3,Garage days,"Stuck, starring Mena Suvari, is a dark, urban drama of sorts that centers on a true event. Although in real life the outcome was different, the makers of this film seemed to create quite a few different scenarios that all keep one on the edge of their seats. Suvari does an excellent job in her part, as the nurses assistant whose balance between an up and coming career and a big, partying lifestyle are disrupted one night when she is involved in a hit and run accident that takes the victim home with her.I was expecting much less in terms of a good script and memorable characters, and overall was surprised at the careful detail that was laid out for this film. Sure, it isn't anything to write home about, but still smooth, as well as gritty enough, to keep your attention. The final scene has a few surprises in it and even adds a few slight touches of humor as well."

4,Stuck on poverty (3.5 stars) - Stuck (Gordon),"So, this is what is life in America? Joking aside, this is a terrific look at the consequences of the ""culture of success"" permeating the United States. Which is in fact no success at all, but mostly submission to bosses, bureaucracy and money. It is the law of the jungle in ""Stuck"", but when Stephen Rea, a victim of downsizing, gets stuck in Mena Suvari's windshield he seems still incapable to understand that his society no longer functions, and waits for her to get help. That never comes. I don't see this film as a black comedy but as an indictment, a suspenseful look at the effects of a socially inept landscape in some individuals fighting to maintain their status in the ranks of the low class (they are... stuck!). More insight and this could have been masterful. As it is, it constitutes a very enjoyable action film."
3,not what i expected....,"mena suvari....i love that she played a character that was a little out of her element, the plot wasn't as good as it could have been but i will give them a B for effort."
4,tiny but awesome,"This charm is way smaller than I anticipated-I was thinking penny-sized and it's the size of my pinky fingernail. It's really beautiful though and I will keep it, it will look good on a delicate silver chain."
3,Good idea - more of this needed,This book is covering all the aspects of the economic and social aspects of e-Commerce. It is well thought through. I enjoyed the book.
5,Simply Beautiful!,"This is the perfect example of quality pop music.You will probably like it even if you are're listening to classical or Heavy Metall!!So refreshing,so young,so beautiful!Listening to their Unplugged Album,I was thinking that somehow these girls are underestimating their real potential...becouse the ""studio"" work they ve done so far,in comparison to this,isjust too superficial and teenish.Songs like REM's ""Everybody hurts"" and Jimmy Hendricks ""Little Wing"" aremore than enough reasons to buy this CD."
5,fantastic four,"The Corrs are simply fantastic and georgeous as well. I fell in love with ""RUNAWAY"" and ""ANDREA"" as well and the rest is history. I have all their albums and all might as well be the most beautiful and the best cd collection one could ever have. My sisters introduced me to the Corrs which was just beginning to hit the local charts, I was skeptical at first but they blew me away. They are pure talent and beauty. Unplugged proves to be an interesting album, everyones the winner. Could you tell me any artist family who can do that? I am a fan for life! I love ""AT YOUR SIDE"" cause its very reassuring and brillant. They did their best and it verily paid off. Get their new cd ""IN BLUE"" with the lead single ""BREATHLESS"" breaking chart records at no.1 in this side of the planet! To the Corrs, Bravo and keep up the good work!"
5,I absolutly agree,"I really agree with the others but ther's still one thng to mention: On the super song NO FRONTIERS the lead vocalists are Sharon and Caroline (Andrea does not sing ANY note!) I think Sharon and Caroline are also very good singers (well, Andrea is a little better) but they should sing more!"
3,"Not Terrible, Not Awesome","I believe this is the ""newer"" version of Coco Chanel, but I must say, it actually smells a bit more old-lady than I expected. Again, not terrible, and I'm certainly using it, but it's a bit too ""foofy"" for my tastes."
1,hIGHWAY ONE ALBUM,"THIS WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT. THE MYSTIC MOODS QRCHESTRA WAS KNOWN FOR THEIR GREAT MUSIC BLENDED WITH NATURAL SOUNDS. I COULD FIND NOTHING ""ORCHESTRAL"" ABOUT THIS ALBUM---I HAD NOT EXPECTED VERBAL RECITATIONS. IT WAS A REAL TURN-OFF!"
1,Must be an acquired taste.,"Consists of spoken prose (some guy droning on about a woman he encountered) and early 70's elevator music - with sounds of the surf, rain, and fog horns mixed in.Yes It's 5.1 DTS sound - but make sure you find and listen to a sample before spending your money because ""Fresh Air"" this is not.I bought this based upon the reviews here and am very disappointed. I knew it was a gamble and I lost."
2,Where is the Oingo?,This album is by Boingo as Oingo was dropped from the title. It is not the only thing missing in this album. Oingo Boingo's music was always dark with a somewhat danceable beat to it. This album is just dark and really has no sing along songs on it. Not the kind of cd you want to play at a party. It is so different from other cds put out by Oingo Boingo that you scratch your head and ask yourself why would they release as this their last cd? Huge Oingo Boingo fan....so - so fan of Boingo.
2,Where's the fun?,"I'm quite surprised that there are so many positive reviews about this album. This is easily the weakest recording they ever released. Gone are the horns, the manic edginess, the sense of humor, and even the strong sense of melody. Where once we had a band with their own unique sound and vision, we're now left with a stripped down version of Oingo Boingo that chose to follow the darker trends of the time like NIN. There's nothing wrong with being dark, but little of it screams of sincerity. They even grew their hair long, got some tatoos, and sported the grunge look at the time in a feeble attempt to appeal to the current musical trends/fashion at the time. If there's one positive about the album it's that we see early indications of where Elfman was heading with some of his soundtrack scores, and I suppose it's a departure from their usual sound. It's not as bad listening to it today as it was when it first came out, but it's just not all that inspired."
1,You have got to be kidding me,"Over 16 minutes for the song Change? Hey! is a track that sounds like Boingo just missed the grunge phase and desperately wanted to get in on the tail end. I Am The Walrus was completely butchered. I like Oingo Boingo, but this album completely misses the mark and lacks the traditional upbeat, frenetic feel."
3,Not the best design,"I should have read the review prior to purchasing this for my son. He likes the blocks and being able to put them back in their homes. We do this a ton since the only thing holding them in is a sheet of plexiglass on each side which falls out constantly, resulting in a dumping of all the blocks. This product could be improved by making a modification so that there is something that actually holds the plexiglass in place."
3,Not great,"Thomas Alphabet HouseI bought these for my nephew's first birthday, he absolutely loves Thomas the Tank Engine. I let him play with them and he preferred to either throw them or bang two together. I decided to put them up until he is older. The only thing keeping all the blocks in place are two plastic covers (which are not very durable) that slide on and off very easily, so unless you prefer to pick up all the blocks I recommend leaving the tape on. The complete alphabet is included once, but the other blocks just seem to have been randomly selected (there are three i's for some reason). The pictures look like they might scratch off easily."
5,Great Map!,"What can I say that everyone hasn't already said. I am so happy that I purchased this map. I have 3 other maps of Paris, but none are as good as this one. I really like the way it is laid out. This would be the map that I would recommend to my friends."
2,Terrible because it is hard to read,"The maps in this ""mapguide"" are very hard to read. Map labels are in random colors, fonts, and sizes, and are often crowded next to each other so you can't tell where one label begins and the other ends. There is minimal information about any of the landmarks, museums, restaurants, and so on which are on the maps. If you want a map of Paris, get a real map from a publisher such as Streetwise, Rough Guides, or National Geographic. The maps in this book look like they were made by amateurs. If you want a guidebook, get a proper guidebook. I eventually went with Frommer's. Others have recommended Rick Steves."
5,One and Only you'll need...,"SUPERB mapbook - the BEST (and I've tried nearly all!) Need the Monoprix or Prixunic nearest your hotel? It's there. Major sites/monuments? Bien sur. Important phone numbers? Oui. A bank? Pourquoi non? Even drugstores and churches are marked, as are major dept stores, boutiques and the like. Info section is basic enough to be helpful but not overwhelming. Easy to use, small, thin, but SO COMPLETE there's no point to any other map collection. Typeface is good and clear (tiny, yes - but that's necessary.) Have used for many years (replacing as they fall apart - literally!) and never have I been lost or even disoriented (and I have a terrible sense of direction!) I won't change so long as this GEM is published! See London's version, too - equally as marvelous."
5,The Only Map You Need,"This mapguide was absolutely incredible and WAS the only map we needed to find our way around Paris. Easy to read, with Metro and RER stations, street names and attractions clearly marked. We eagerly share this book with others who will be visiting the city and they, too, are amazed at how well it is done. I will soon be spending time in Prague, Budapest, and Vienna, and I wish similar maps were available."
5,Mapguide Perfection,"Having travelled some what, I feel qualified to fairly assess 'The Paris Mapguide'. There are many guides of Paris on store bookshelves far more illistrated and far more detailed but they do not address the basic needs of a traveller standing on a Paris street. This publication meets all requirements, it is the right size,street maps and the 'Metro'are percise and very easy to read and the supporting information, be it city history,districts,places of interest etc, are all there.'The Paris Mapguide' will facilitate an enjoyable visit to this beautiful city."
4,Handy size with detailed maps,"To be honest, we picked up a Metro (subway) map and a free city map and used those more than we used this one. It was just one more book to carry along with us. The size is handy and the maps are very detailed....when we got lost, we did use this map book to find our way to where we needed to be. I can say that I recommend it if you are not an experienced traveler or if you plan to do a lot of exploring on foot."
3,just ok,I had hoped this would be the perfect guide to use while in Paris on a recent trip but it wasn't. I didn't find it convenient so it didn't become the 'go to' map on a recent trip. I should have bought a laminated fold-up map with the metro and train routes superimposed on the street map. Friends had one of that type and I kept borrowing it from them to plot my routes to various museums and restaurants that I wanted to visit. It was far too difficult to use the guide I purchased because you couldn't visualize the whole trip since only one section of the map is visible at a time. I'll know better the next time.
2,google maps is better,"not bad at all, but hardly worth all the hype either. maybe i just had bad luck -- it seemed like everything i wanted was right on the edge of one of the maps and it was hard to follow onto the adjoining map (on another page) also, not the easiest to read. i found printing the relevant page from google maps was easier to read, scalable, and easier to handle (fold, etc.) also, amidst all the detail, no taxi stands?"
3,Tom Petty heavily influenced by Dwight Twilley's sound,"I've mentioned elsewhere that Tom Petty was heavily influenced by Dwight Twilley's band, and you can hear a bit of the Petty sound in Twilley's ""I'm on Fire"" and the influence it may have had on the Heartbreakers, whose first LP came out in 1976. The Dwight Twilley Band was Dwight Twilley, of course, and Phil Seymour, who had a substantial solo hit in 1981 with ""Precious to Me."""
5,"Cat 6, 50ft Cable -- Electrons Follow It Everywhere!",This cable works as well as any of the name brands at a mere fraction of the cost. Why pay more?
2,Broken and out of stock!!!,"I enjoyed this pen for exactly 2 hours until the eraser mechanism fell out. I then noticed there was a crack down the side of the pen right at the spot where the pen was broken. Needless to say that I have to return it as damaged goods. Well, Wacom seems to have delayed their shipments and now I won't have a usable pen for my tablet PC. I've had nothing but bad experience with Wacom product manufacturing delays in the past. They have so many delays when shipping their products it's out of hand. Their products are usually of superior quality and warrant the delays but not this time. I am quite frustrated and a bit sad this showed up damaged."
1,not correct one,picture looks like it should work and it was supposed to work for my travelmate C300 and it would not fit into the slot.
5,ASUS Slate EP121 Compatible,"I got this as a spare for my ASUS Slate EP121 and it works great, even better than the one that came with it. It does not fit in the slot for the original, but fits great in the case slot. I highly recommend this product."
4,Works with Asus EP121,"Just an FYI... this works fine with the Asus EP121 tablet. It's the same length and diameter as the pen that comes with the EP121, although due to the presence of the switch it can *not* be stored inside the tablet: The switch makes it a skosh too big, and it tends to get stuck. Oops! Still, this is not a knock against the pen itself: I keep mine in the case that comes with/wraps around the tablet, and figure I then have a spare if I accidentally lose or break this one.The price strikes me as somewhat high, but I guess that's how it works when Wacom's performance is a noticeable steep above all the other guys!"
5,Penabled Eraser Pen,It works out of the box. The length is perfect for me. The price is right. You can't go wrong with this......unless you lose it.
1,Wish I could tell you how it works,But I can't because the tip fell out the first time I used the pen. Put in one of the replacements supplied and it fell out too. This thing is too expensive to die with first use.
5,unforgettable,"Jacintha was originally one of 3 novellas within The Lovers. The first and best, it was a Victorian dream of Hell seen through the eyes of a woman of quality of that era. Her most erotic fantasies are realized through the auspices of the Devil. She never learned in life what real lust could be, and how a woman can fall under its spell until right and wrong no longer have a meaning. I was in my teens when I first found this book and have never forgotten it. It would be lovely to see it republished, just to see the differences in reader reaction between then, the 50s when this was written, and the reader of the new millenium. It would be laughable if it were not so sensual. Think of Hell as a huge hotel complex set in Yellowstone National Park of the 1880s, where living trappers and Indians pass through. Any huge hotel with endless corridors always reminds me of Hell and Jacintha. Try it (if you can find it) and you'll be glad you did."
1,Goes nowhere,"This novella is about beautiful young Victorian woman, Jacintha, who finds herself in Hell after her husband shoots her for adultery. The ""Hell"" depicted in the story is a large hotel filled with vapid people in period dress. The Devil is a charming, handsome, well... ""devil"". Upon arriving in Hell, Jacintha meets her own mother, also young and beautiful, and they find themselves in competition for the Devil's affections. However, having set up this interesting conflict, Winsor does nothing with it: the story simply ends without any resolution. Really, this is quite a disappointment from the author of ""Forever Amber"" - a wonderful read. I really can't recommend this book, except to the extent that it is a very original premise, and it won't waste much time as it is quite short. Other than that, it is really dull."
3,Spike Remix,The best version here seems to be the spike vocal remix. It still sounds new even though song is 14 years old now. The trip house version has techno feel and is not bad.
1,Save your Money,"This is crap, it would not even cover 2 sq ft of material. Their other type of can using a triger is great."
3,Norelco 1050cc,"I have been using the product for about two weeks. It does a good job, no better then my old razor no worse. My one complaint is the trimmer. Its hard to use because its small and the heads get in the way."
4,great customer service from norelco,"This razor worked great but would never hold a charge for longer than 5 min. We called the company and they sent a new one out right away. Unlike many other companies that we have dealt with, Norelco even paid to ship the old one back. Great company, great razor"
3,ok,"The razor is ok, I'm not blown away by how close it gets or how well it shaves my neck...I have a super sensitive neck and it does do a good job of less irritation, but it doesn't necessarily do the best job at removing all the hairs. Also, the fact that you must unplug the charger from the wall when you don't want the razor to charge is a ridiciously idiotic design flaw."
2,Honest Review here,i purchased this norelco from best buy it looked cool and was the most expensive one there so i figured it has to be good. came home was very excited opened it was very stylish i had a light 5 ocklock shadow going on so i decided to shave it. i had to go over FIVE times to cut most of my beard off and it left behind many little hairs. very sloppy job.i spent a little more and got the BRAUN shaver which is 10 times better even though it doesnt look as stylish and is bigger.
3,Not easy to operate,This was a gift for my Day. Just opening the storage pod is difficult and putting it back in is almost impossible. I was surprised that there was no place to put head protective cover. Since you don't us it while self cleaning and it doesn't store in the pod it is sure to get lost. My dad wanted something that was self cleaning because he has a tough time putting the older units together afterward. I suspect that this shaver will just sit in a drawer regardless on how well it shaves.
4,Charging Issues,I love the razor and cleaner. The only issue I have is that the if you let the cleaner go through the entire cycle it will charge the battery even when you are told in the instructions to fully discharge the battery before charging. The problem is easily solved by unpluging the cleaning stand right after cleaning is complete. When fully discahrged I let it run the full cycle. The razor shaves as promiced and gets places that I couldn't with my spectra!
4,Philips Norelco 1050CC,"Over the years, have purchased many models of Philips shavers. This model give me the closest shave so far. While it does require more frequent cleaning than older models, the cleaning system is very convenient."
5,Best shave,"I bought this razor with some misgivings due to the reviews posted on this site. However, this is a wonderful electric razor. I have used a variety of brands of electric razors over the years. This one gives a closer shave, more comfortably, than any razor I have ever used. For me, this razor gives a closer shave than a blade without all the nicks. I could not be happier with it."
1,How Disappointing!!!,"I have been using Norelco shavers for over 35 years. For the first time, I am dissatisfied. I have been using the arcitec 1050cc for almost three weeks, and I have yet to get a decent shave. It leaves lots of stubble. Also, caring for this shaver is a real pain in the neck. I am probably going to go back to my Norelco 8240XL.Philips Norelco Speed 8240XL Men's Shaving System"
4,great shaver,"THIS KIND OF SHAVER IS VERY GREAT TO USE. I USE IT EVERY MORNING. It give me a bright face, SO I recommend it."
5,Fantastic Razor,"Amazon I can't say enough good things about the products and serices you offer and this razor was one of them. I can't begin to say how great I think this razor is. This is the best Norleco I have ever owned. I have been an electric razor shaver for 35 years and this is by far the best I have ever owned. Oh by the way all of them were Norleco's. Close shave, comfortable. Fantastic."
4,Arcitec vs. Braun,"Hi all..well, after having a Braun Series 700 for about a year, I switched over to the Norelco Arcitec with the cleaning station. Each unit has their advantages. Braun cleaning system is better ( no need to unplug afer two hours; probably cleans a bit better than the Norelco.) BUT, the Braun was hot against my skin after a minute of shaving, and I even cut myself with it! Hard to believe..maybe I shave too hard! The Arcitec did a far better job with its rotary heads on my neck on the underside of the chin. The Braun never got this area closely shaved and I had to contort the razor in different directions to get the hair shaved closely. No need to do that with the Arcitec...a faster shave. Arcitec less heavy and easier to hold. Yes, the trimmer is a bit small - but it works. I sent the Braun to my son - we will see how he likes it. But for the now, the Arcitec stays with me!"
4,Norelco 1050CC,"I have owned this product for 2 weeks. Works great and gives a close shave. The only thing I don't understand is the cleaning system. It is the same as the Braun shavers, but the instructions tell you to unplug the power after the cleaning stage so it will not affect the battery life. If you look at the instructions it takes 2 hrs for the cleaning and drying cycle to finish then your instructed to remove the power. After the cleaning cycle if finished it automaticly goes to the charg cycle. If you are like me I am at work by then in the morning. Come on Norelco, whats with this. Poor design on Norelcos part. The shaver does give a nice close shave and is great looking.I'll only give this product 4 stars because of the cleaning/charging system. How many of us are going to remove the power after cleaning. Are you going to stand there and wait. I don't think so."
1,flimsy junk,"this beautiful electric razor never had a chance. when opened christmas morning we tried to set up the razor on the charging station. the place where it should sit was loose and when we pushed the razor into place on it, the razor sprung off onto the wooden floor and then one wheel flew into pieces. it's all plastic toy pieces! I hate to think what would have happened if it had sprung onto a hard bathroom floor.a big disappointment."
4,philips norelco arcitec shaver,Shaves closer than my Braun razor. light weight and cleans easily. would recommend this shaver.
2,"Skip the fancy technology, stick with their basic units","I am a long time user of Norelco shavers. Recently I purchased their new 1050X ARCITEC shaver. I do NOT like it. The grip (motor unit) is too small and not comfortable to hold while shaving. The floating head unit is too flimsy. The unit requires that the shaving units be opened and cleaned on EVERY use - a pain in the neck. I like the basic Norelco units and really like their SPEED-XL series shavers, which by the way are much less expensive than the Arcitec units. I my estimation, the Arcitec shavers are not worth their expense and I regret wasting my money on one. Stick with their standard units and enjoy their performance."
2,Good Razor for a 15 year old.,"I have been shaving for over 17 years now and this razor would be good if you just had peach fuzz and don't get a 5 o'clock shadow by noon. I used this razor for a week thinking I would give this a try with the money back offer. Here are my opinions:It feels like you have a piece of plastic in your hand instead of a sturdy shaving system. You cannot get a close shave on the neck. Even after grinding the shaver into my neck for several minutes it still looked the same. Forget about using the trimmer I could do better with my nose trimmer for my sideburns. Price...for what it delivered it was not worth it.Pros: I liked the cleaning system, but that is about it.Needless to say I switched to another brand (it was just as expensive) and have been very happy."
1,Poor shaver,"I have owned Norelco Shavers for over 30 years. This model was painful to shave with. It took excessive pressure against the skin to shave. The trimmer does not pop out far enough to be useful. The only thing I liked that I didn't think I would like was the cleaner. My older Norelco shaved closer, did not miss hairs, and was comfortable to use. The shaver does look pretty and inovative but dosen't shave worth a hoot!"
1,Worst Ever,"After an extended try out of more than a year, I have to conclude this is the worst shaver I've ever seen. Neither the shaver shaves, nor the cleaning system clean. This thing is so bad, that I don't know how to dispose of it. I wouldn't give it to anyone I know, I wouldn't accept any money for it. It is shamefully bad."
2,"You know, there's a couple of songs you probly want to iTune...","Well, I heard the first track on the radio, so, what the heck! Now having listened to it, the stars of track and field, and Judy and her dream of horses, for me, are really the radio-worthy listenable catchy tunes. The stuff in between is, you know, indie-shlock, blah blah twangy nothingness. Though, don't get me wrong, would be very suitable for say, trying to seduce 20 something, depressed, slightly higher than average IQ, lonely, journal keeping, liberal arts degree program dropouts. (note: For Engineering degree dropouts, DEVO Hardcore Vol.2 suits this purpose) Oh, and hey, what's the deal with the singer? He sounds like a disaffected English guy with a cleft palate and a hare lip, who has a predeliction for baby talk. Don't get me wrong though, it really works on those two songs!"
1,YUK!,"The thing that i hate the most about this band is their fan base. Cheesey, pretentious, weak, whimpy, pansey, wanna-be artsy, psuedo intellectual, corn ball, and down right annoying people. I don't get it. Maybe it's cuz i'm not gay."
5,Spotlight review my foot!,"There isn't much I can say about this album that hasn't already been said. It is wonderful, and one of my favorites. The ""spotlight review"" at the top of the reviews has really angered me, though. Intelligent and informed listeners of music do not base their opinions of albums on what they think about other albums. For example, if I were to say, ""I listened to 'If You're Feeling Sinister,' and I didn't like it as much as a Magnetic Fields album..."" This is not helpful to anyone. Also, anyone that buys music based on hype should be sentenced to Top 40 for life."
3,Sincere sophomore,"3 1/2Captures the group at their breezy-best..moody and melancholic at times for sure, but simplistic enough to shine through before future arrangement ambitions often stilted the process"
2,Unimpressed,"I can see the comparisons I read to Syd Barrett's style, but I found this album sort of monotonous. It has an appeal to it, but not enough where I would buy the album.On another note, I was reading the song-by-song 'review' given by another user here where they basically gave the same rating to every song and said almost the same things about every song. Write a review that's useful! If you're going to review each song, and you're going to give each song an A then don't EVEN BOTHER WITH IT!"
1,"""ooooh its not beautiful""","Trendy Jehovah's Witnessess listen to this band. It's lo-fi music that has potential to be good, but in reality misses the mark. Try Trembling Blue Stars. Much better."
2,Well...,"I dunno...it's not a terrible album by any means, but certainly not worthy of the copious amounts of praise everyone's heaping on it. Don't get me wrong; I like wordy, pseudo-intellectual music as much as the next person, but I find large portions of If You're Feeling Sinister to be intensely irritating. Most of their lyrics, to be frank, really aren't *all that* clever--a flaw which could be overlooked if the melodies were better, but they really aren't much either; many of them have a kind of annoying sing-songy quality to them, and Murdoch's voice can become very annoying indeed, especially since he sings everything in basically the same tone. Okay, it has a few halfway decent tunes (Stars of Track and Field, Get Me Away From Here...), but I have to say it: The Boy With the Arab Strap is an infinitely better album; If ...Sinister... had been been my first taste of B&S, I can safely say I would never have given them a second glance. That's all."
3,look at the source,"If you like Belle and Sebastian..find their source. Nick Drake - great, soft spoken music and a very talented guitar player as well. I asked myself what Belle and Senbastian added to the songwriter gendre and alas went back to my Nick Drake collection. Belle and Sebastian are a good bunch of students."
3,Buy Arab Strap First!,"I can't understand why ppl think this album is better than Arab Strap, because it's not. It's alright, there are some great songs..stars of track and field, seeing other people, get me away...etc. But there are some meant-to-be-bsides as well such as the title track, fox in the snow, boy done wrong..it just doesn't equal to the brilliance of the more polished follow-up. Just thought I'd speak my piece."
2,A Report from St. Aubreys School for Delicate Musicians,"Belle and Sebastian are a sensitive, pale group given to fits of shivering and meloncholy. That they are bright there is no doubt, but they don't apply themselves to their work. They don't make eye contact, have trouble socializing and have few friends. Perhaps there is trouble at home? I'm afraid the other bands find them to be an easy target for bullying and often steal their lunch money. Just the other day they had to be sent home after the Smiths tied them to a tree and refused to give them back their guitars. We've noticed some troubling self-esteem issues: the singer is so ashamed of his braces that he refuses to open his mouth wide enough to sing properly. Perhaps someday they'll adjust and become productive citizens, although school is often indicative of how well a band will do in later life. Oh well..."
3,It is good but not that good.,"You people hand out stars like they are Lucky Charms! Judy and the Dream of Horses is a great song but this is really just a good little record. What is so shocking is that the band had the guts to make a ""gentle"" record when the airwaves are flooded with regurgetated punk(?) like Rancid."
3,Solid Belle & Sebastian,"I really like this one, but it doesn't measure up to the absolute perfection of ""Fold Your Hands Child..."". However a great buy if you are hungry for the sound."
1,How pretentious can we be?,"This album makes me increasingly violent as time goes on. People rave about Belle & Sebastian as if they are innovative. If You're Feeling Sinister is just pretentious, ""intellectual"" ramblings. There is not true substance to the lyrics. It all just says ""look at me! I am witty!"" instead of having meaning. If you do want to check out Belle & Sebastian, buy the Boy with the Arab Strap or try and have someone copy Tigermilk for you. Only nice thing about this album is you can annoy your mum with ""Stars of Track & Field"" and you can reminisce back to Charlie Brown days with certain songs."
2,Simply over-rated,"I'm a huge fan of indie-music and sometimes get sucked in by reviews of bands who are usually written by their fans. I was very excited to hear this due to comments that they were the ""best band ever"" and the comparisons to Simon & Garfunkel.To say the least, I was disappointed..."
2,"""Tigermilk"" is the one to get","This record isn't really bad, but it's very bland. The songs melt into one another, there are no highs or lows, no peaks. You can play this when your parents come over for dinner and they will think that you've become ""nice"". Tigermilk was far better, a real masterpiece of pop. Also, I'm surprised that nobody has commented on this bands blatant ripp-off of the Smith's record covers."
1,Pretty damn boring,"If you're feeling sinister and buy this album, it will put you to sleep before you commit any unpropitious acts."
4,"a good album, but don't go crazy","Let's be honest -- Belle and Sebastian are not earth-shattering, groundbreaking, or particularly novel (please see Felt). That is not to say, however, that this is not a good album with some great songs. ""Seeing Other People"" and ""Like Dylan In the Movies"" are incredibly catchy... but to me, the adolescent angst that permeates most of these lyrics doesn't warrant some of the ravest reviews here."
4,Ethereal yet down to earth and beautifully melodic,"A friend of mine put it very well when he said that ""seeing other people"" was so good it made him want to cry; the vocals have a soft, breathy and melodic quality that are layered over melodic waves of sound. This music evokes a lot of feelings and gently calms them back down again."
5,my favorite album of 1997,"Are you fed up with the crap that's permeating around radio and mtv, then why don't you give this album a try? i stumbled onto this album on a hunch and i ended up loving it so much. There's plenty of very catchy songs with wonderful lyrics here like ""me and the major,"" ""seeing other people"" and other gems. I can say that this album is absolutely wonderful from start to finish, which is more than you can say for the average hit album wherein there are only one or two good songs and the rest are filler. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!"
4,consistently mellow album,"this is the most consistently mellow of the b&s albums out there. the first time i listened to it, i didn't like it as much as tigermilk or arab strap--it lacked the up-tempo catchy tunes of other b&s efforts. but this one grew on me and now, when i just want to relax, i pull this cd out. like few other albums, this is one where you won't find a track you have to skip every time. just let this one play all the way through. i wouldn't pick this album as your intro to belle & sebastian...acquire their taste with the boy with the arab strap and then see if you like their mellow side...."
5,The Best Band in Existence,"There are three words synonymous with euphony... and that is Belle and Sebastian. All of their albums have been exceptional and the best, In my opinion, has been ""If You're Feeling Sinister"". Words cannot describe this album, From the opening of ""The Stars Of Track And Field"" to the finale of ""Judy And the Dream Of Horses"", you are engulfed for a period of about forty minutes by sheer musical pleasure. This is a real album. Nothing comes close to it. Buy it or you will be settling with mediocre ""popular music""."
4,Embarassed that I didn't find this sooner!,"Being a big fan of ""The Boy With the Arab Strap"" and especailly of ""Tigermilk"" I can't figure out why I didn't get around to listening to this sooner. This album is amazing! Stuart Murdoch's voice alone is so beautiful and unique that Belle and Sebastian stand leagues away from any other band. And this album is a great ""album"" not just a compilation of songs. This should be a staple in every record collection especially for those who love Belle and Sebastian."
1,Waste of Money,"I was curious to read but very disappointed, no new information here that is not common knowledge to all. 128 page advertisement for over-priced supplement the author sells."
1,Long Advertisement,"Looks like prior reviews were either friends or enemies of the author so I will give my objective point of view. I am not a nutrition expert, but do try to keep up on the latest nutrition news. there is some truth to each review; it is a quick read, it is dated, it is like cliff notes (not sure that's a good thing), but my problem with it is it seemed like I paid for a book that turned out to be a supplement the author is trying to push, there are much better nutrition books out there for the price with authors that seem to have the background required to give such advice."
5,Vroom! Vroom!,"My 3 yr old son loves this book. I was concerned that with him having Bob the Builder and Jay Jay that he'd not use this one, but the draw of fire engines, garbage trucks, crane, cement truck, excavator and other cool things that vroom draw him to this one like a magnet."
3,Good Buy overall,"It is a SLIM pen and its also a small pen in circumference, maybe only slightly thicker than some of the old PDA stylus. But itdoes work on HP Compaq 4200 and 4400 tablet PC's, which is really all I care about. It offers significant savings over buying a new OEM pen from the manufacturer (or even a used one from eBay). I would prefer it be a little heftier, but it works and I like the price! I don't believe it can be refilled, but it still offers savings in the long run also.My main worry is misplacing it as it will fit into the pen storage slot it is too slender to be held in the slot, and it doesn't come with a tether."
3,Call it tiny.,"This works, but it is only 3 1/2"" tiny. The seller should state this and/or show a size comparative picture.I could have gotten a nice pen from Wallyworld had I known, Oh well, another item I don't need."
1,Pen doesnt work with Toshiba tablet PCs!!,This tablet PC fails miserably and does not work at all with Toshiba tablet PCs. I would not recommend!!! I asked for instructions on how to return PEN and never got reply from company.
2,"A good idea, poorly executed","This book offers a fascinating premise but fails to live up to its promise. It begins in intriguing and mysterious fashion, but quickly bogs down in a morass of minutiae, stilted dialogue, and wooden characters. All of which is a shame, because it really could have been a good story.At 700+ pages, this could have been great novel if it has been trimmed to 175."
4,Excelent Book for Dummies,"For someone who always feared learing UNIX, this made me look like an idiot for delaying that for so long!"
1,Disappointment,"Oxford's earlier paperback of this title had larger type, larger page size, better pictures. I had expected the same book. Now I think the hardbound is a much better buy."
3,"Good, but....","It has neither the romance of many Oxford Companions nor the authenticity of a Chapman...and it's not cheap. It is probably best enjoyed as a ""short read"" by leaving it at the bedside or in the bathroom bookrack. Just flip through it and read the paragraphs that catch your interest; it really is almost like reading a dictionary for new or interesting words."
1,Don't buy this!,"I was intrigued by the prospect of a small, lightweight camera with no tape. I bought it at the first opportunity. However, having used it for a week, this is a huge disappointment. The battery lasts for meagre 30 minutes or so, and the picture quality indoors is very poor. Colors are pale in weak light. I guess most potential buyers of this camera already own a mini-DV camera of decent quality. Well, compared to my 5 year old Sony TR-V 8 I was greatly disappointed. Stay away!"
5,Written by a master,"Howard Penn Hudson is the publisher of the Newsletter on Newsletters, is a life-founder member of the Newsletter Pulishers Association, and is president of the Newsletter Clearinghouse. His experience and expertise come through in this book. It clearly and thoroughly discusses every major aspect of subscription and non-subscription newsletters. He talks about writing, design, printing, marketing, the industry as a whole, and much more. He is an excellent writer and communicates his expertise very clearly. Many newsletter examples are given in color. This book is worth the price."
5,Imagination,"This album is very sentimental to me. My album is worn out and I wish to purchase the C.D. When a friend I know has suffered a loss and is hurting, I let them know I care by playing the song ""Storm of Troubled Times"". It has been over 25 years since I first listened to this song after a friend's funeral and I still know the words almost by heart."
2,Period piece from a bad period,"This film was silly and dumb the day it came out, and it remains so today, even given the nostalgic smirk that it will conjure up from most of its viewers. The eighties was a time of teen dance movies, and this one cashes in as best it can. A reviewer below is right to point out that the premise of a town that outlaws dancing is utterly ridiculous. (Perhaps had the film been set in the late 1600s it would have been believable, but then they wouldn't have been able to sell the cheesy pop soundtrack.) Along comes the inevitable good-looking rebel to shake things up with his slinky moves. As a period piece, this formulaic eighties film might be good for a few warm guffaws. Otherwise it's pretty insipid, and holds up even less well than many Elvis movies from the sixties."
2,More boring than not,"I am glad that I finally saw Kevin Bacon's performance in this, but the film was a big disappointment. There were some good moments, however I found most of the film b-o-r-i-n-g. Try Dirty Dancing instead."
1,Footloose never came,"It has been well over a month and I have not received ""Footloose"" from THMP752002 and they won't answer an email. I notice their other feedback is pitiful. Amazon should have never listed this seller."
3,Dated,"I was embarrassed in re-watching this movie how dated it was. The dancing is cheesy, really bad hair, bad music, and great actors like John Lithgow and Diane Wiest stuck in bad roles. Skip this one and watch ""Streets of Fire."""
1,Does anybody notice!!,"Does anybody notice that this movie is about a town that outlaws dancing? I mean Christ on a Cracker, this script actually went through executives that said, ""Yeah, this movie is great, lets do this thing."" And how does a town that hasn't been able to dance for 6 years so good at dancing. Go figure. Also the song footloose is the 2nd gayest song in the world (The First is Jitterbug by WHAM""). If I could give no stars I would, but unfortunately I cannot."
5,Footloose,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, I have always loved Kevin Bacon as he is a great actor. I love all of the music in it and I also have the Soundtrack from it. The movie really tells the story of what teen-agers want and it's not just drugs and sex, it's just to be free to live, sing, dance and be happy. Amazon, you are the BEST!!!!!"
3,Not so controversial,"I loved the music and dancing. Kevin Bacon does a creditable job, but this isn't the 1984 version of Rebel Without a Cause or American Graffiti. I graduated high school in 1963 and nobody thought it at all shameful to dance. Churches even sponsored dances. The old heresy that one would get to heaven if a person didn't dance, drink, smoke, play cards and not go to the picture show on Sunday. To consider this breaking free from a stultifying moralistic would mean breaking open a casket that had been planted so long the 50-year-old leak-proof guarantee had expired. The film was very sedate, safe, but very entertaining. I don't remember seeing it when it was released--one that got passed me.I remember a funny joke from my teen years. A former straight laced young man celebrates saying, ""I don't need, smoking, drinking, or dancing--I've found necking."
4,Classic,Just had to rent the original to show a 12 year old why it was remade and why the original was better!
4,Footloose fun,I loved this movie in highschool. Now my daughters can enjoy it too!! It was fun seeing the actors all grown up.
5,"This is a plain FUN movie! Guys, watch it with girls.","Yes it's homoerotic, the dancers are too good, and there's so much silly about this film, but it's so much darn fun. Guys, this is the perfect movie to watch with girls. I've not seen a girl yet who doesn't love this movie (and even loves making fun of this movie!). Invite a girl to your house, have this movie playing, and she'll have a good time with you."
4,Footloosin' good time!,"I don't think that in real life a pastor can actually outlaw dancing in a town but it makes a decent story. Great highlights in the film are when Kevin Bacon taught Chris Penn's character how to dance(lets hear it for the boy!), the fight scene when Bacon and Penn beat up the corny tough guys,and of course the great dancing during the prom which closed the film."
4,Footloose and Free!,"I cannot believe it has been 25 years ago that we watched this movie in the theatres! Wow!It caused an uproar then with our friends but today seems somewhat calm and shows that kids really need a little freedom of expression to do what comes naturally. Of course, all within reason and respect.Still a great movie to watch with your grandkids and talk about what things were like ""back in the old days!"""
5,love the moive,love the moives 80 moives are great havent see it in long time but would watch it over and over
4,Flick full of fun and beat!,"This movie is about a boy who moves into a small town which has been on the silence of dance and parties since the time a boy was killed in an accident which shook the town, and blamed it on the drinking and drugs at the parties, dances that young people caused. Once ayoung man (Kevin) arrives in the god for saken dump (as he calls it) he notices the problems that the place has and decides to bring the dance he has long waited for to city hall. It is a problem due to that the hall has banned it, and so it takes off from there. I liked it and would recommend it to you people."
4,A Great Time!,"This movie will definitely make you feel good no matter how in the dumps you are. Growing up as a teenager in the 80's this was one of my favorite movies, even though the storyline may seem silly to some the music is great and the dance scenes are fun to watch. I recently purchased the video and have already watched it twice, it brings back such good memories and I believe this film really put Kevin Bacon on the map. This is one of the movies I wouldn't mind if they made a sequel to, it's a shame they never did. ""Footloose"" was one of the best movies of 1984, and it's for people of all ages."
2,"Great music, terrible movie","Okay I just bought the CD to the Broadway recording and saw the show on Broadway and loved it. The music is great. But I was so disapointed when I saw the actual movie, it was below expectations. Skip this soundtrack and go the Cast Recording one, the singers are much better."
4,Very classic movie and soundtrack,"As I said in the title, great nostalgic movie, story, acting, etc. I enjoy watching the movie over and over. I would give this 5 stars but I will give the DVD tech guys an F for not putting any features (besides ws format) on this. I think some trailers, interviews, and other stuff would have fit. They could have done a little segment on all of the songs featured here. Aside from this, great DVD."
1,Boring,"this film was Boring.for all the street dancing&music where are African-Americans? it's a cheap take on Breakin',Flashdance,Fame,etc..Kevin Bacon is Okay.but this film is very FOrgettable."
3,GREAT MOVIE BUT A BIT GRAINY,Not up to HD standards but still loved and enjoyed the film.. if your a fan go and get it just dont expect the graphics and sound to blow you away..
3,An OK Movie ... Good Music,"This movie is OK. I was personally a little uncomfortable watching it, but that might just be me.It's a great idea for a movie ... A town has outlawed dancing, and the teens, led by a newcomer, try to get it (dancing) back.The acting is good, and the music rocks, but the story (as it is played out) lacks believability. There is one unrealistic scene after another ... depicting events that would never ever happen in real life ... and we are left saying ""Oh come on.""The dancing is OK ... a little unnatural maybe, a little forced ... but fun to watch. I had sort-of hoped it would be a great dancing movie, and so, was disappointed some.The female lead (the minister's daughter) is made to be quite promiscuous. I am guessing this was aimed at the teenage males (the target audience) viewers. If I was Kevin Bacon, I would have steered clear of her (he goes after her, of course).But it's a fun movie at heart, and Kevin Bacon does a good job."
1,Footloose - Region 2,"I seen this movie when it first came out, on T.V. Recently I decided I wanted to purchase this movie, not only for myself, but my daughter, and a friend. It turns out when you reside in the United States, you can not watch/play a movie that states Region 2 on it. I was not aware of what the Region 2 meant, so was unable to watch the DVD and had to send them back. Although I was disappointed about this, Amazon was right on top of their game. They sent a refund directly back to my credit card I used immediately. And they even refunded a portion of the postage I paid to send the DVDs back. What a GREAT company, they really do put their customers first. I will definitely be using this company again in the near future for other purchases. Thank you."
1,Description corrected after purchase,DVD will not play on usa players. Oh were sorry we forgot to mention that. Wonder how many people were ripped off before they changed description . Sorry won't do business with them again.
2,Footloose,"I had not seen Footloose until I saw it live in the theater. I was really excited about sharing it with my middle school general music class in the video form. I expected to purchase the music and have them learn it. I was shocked at the language and nudity in the video when it was rated as PG. (Especially, when the live theater had so much less vulgarity and no nudity.)There is no way I can show it in my classroom to middle school. I did show it to my upperclassmen (seniors) all of whom responded with ""This is PG?"" I appreciate the social issues tackled by this video, but I was really disappointed with language and nudity."
1,Footloose region 2 DVD,I can not watch it.. It says wrong region.. And I don't know if or how I can change the region
3,Remake is better,"I liked this one, but it is dated and I really prefer the 2011 remake. Kevin Bacon did a marvelous job, but so doesn't Kenny Wormald. The few changes that were made really did make a difference - the reason for his going to live with his Uncle, divorce vs death, the attitude of the uncle and the diversification of the cast made a real difference."
1,Stinko,Don't turn back the clock if you can avoid it. Doesn't hold up well at all in the current era.
5,DVD perfect condition,"DVD was in great condition, just as described. Arrived quickly. Such a great movie, glad to add it to my collection. Thank you!"
5,Received timely and as promised,"The item I delivered was delivered timely -- even during the Christmas rush, and the condition as promised. This is a great movie that my daughter wanted to see after having viewed the remake. Brought back a lot of memories for me!"
4,FOOTLOOSE...,"THE PASSION KEEPS IT A GREAT WORK, WITHOUT WHICH IT WON'T BE THAT GREAT.PLAIN, AND SOMETIMES EVEN A LITTLE POINTLESS, HOWEVER, THE BLU-RAY FEATURES KEEP IT AT AN ""A"" STANDARD."
5,The BEST movie ever!!!!!!,"I love this movie! It has so much comedy, but is serious at the same time. Footloose has got a great soundtrack, this movie is gaurenteed make you want to get up and dance. This is one of my favorite movies ever and everyone should see it."
5,"More thank good, great","This book put you in the world of a young boy with the thing that every teenager wishes they could have. It is increditably well written. I personally devoured the book. I started reading and could not put it down until I was completely finished. It was that good. Everyone who reads this book will probably want a ""squip"". If I had one it would make High School alot easier. It was a great read and a great excape from reality."
5,An honest book,"I just wanted to write to say that I just finished Be More Chill and lovedit. I really liked how you made Jeremy's character easy to relate to andhave him do stuff that most of us have done at least once in our lifetimes.I also liked the ending and how you didn't conclude everything. I just gotmy wisdom teeth out on monday, and I can honestly say that without that bookI would have been a lot more miserable. It helped me through my boring daysof just sitting around. There were many nights where I told myself ""Ok, I amonly going to read these 4 chapters,"" but I'd soon find myself on the tenthchapter instead. So, thank you for writing a book that is not only enjoyablebut extremely truthful!"
1,A Masterpiece? More like Gutter Trash,"I have noticed many people praising this book and I honestly don't understand it. This book is as shallow as they come, Ned Vizzini is an outrageous character in his own right as well. The book is just another in an endless flow of ""novels"" which feel the need to point out just how bad teenagers lives are. They then go and offer some ridiculous solution on ways to do things like get girls, or ""Be More Chill"". Isn't that what parents are for? I have met Ned Vizzini and what's even crazier is that he is not a person that should be giving anyone advice on anything. Do society a favor Ned and go chill elsewhere."
2,It's okay..,"I have to admit the first time I read this book I enjoyed it..then I read they are making it into a movie and read it over to see who I would cast in the film..and reading the book over I found myself not liking it. The ending is too abrupt, not a whole lot happens, and the book is a little..out there. But teenagers who enjoy books with a lot of sexual references (one of the things in the book i DID like) will like it, as will teens who can relate to the characters but adults most likely wont enjoy the book and I dont think it would make a good movie at all"
3,PARENTS BEWARE,"As a parent, before you hand this book to your child, please read pages 79-81. I am not judging the content or the writing, however parents should be informed that masturbation, pronography and who knows what else are treated very candidly. If you approve, enjoy."
2,WEIRD,ok this book is just freaky..sure there is fun teen dialogue and situations but this reads more like a science fiction American Pie then anything..plus the ending was so open in the air..whats that all about?weird
5,be more chill,"i thought be more chill was wonderfull. i read it in 1 day and found myself immersed in it and conncerned with it more so then everything else around me. i loved it. it ""tells it like it is"". it tells the truth about teenage and highschool life while ignoring the cliches. its a wonderful and funny book and i would recomend it to everyone 12-21i wouldnt recomend it for anyones parents though, lol"
5,Cant Be More Funny,"Its a quick read, which isnt a good thing, because you'll want this book to keep going. Yup, you can totally relate to the character but still laugh when he messes up. 5 stars!"
3,Just OK.,"Hmmm... ""Be More Chill"" There's really not much to say about it. It deals with an interesting idea of a micro quantum computer that lives inside your brain and tells you how to, well, be more chill, and though the concept was cool I don't think it was a great book. It did have an interesting enough plot that I got sort of hooked but, if a better book had come along I probably would have put it down without much regret. It was funny in parts and that was its saving grace, so, all in all, ""Be More Chill"" was OK, just OK."
4,Be More Chill,"""Be More Chill"" by Ned Vizzini is a really cool book. I think it's not really that funny, but it is a hugely creative story. The book is well-written and is a really quick read.The basic story is that a dorky teenager swallows a supercomputer that teaches him how to be more cool. The supercomputer, or ""squip"", becomes a character of its own.The book is very imaginative and inventive. I enjoyed it a lot. I actually think some of the squip's advice in the book would be very useful to awkward, non-confident teenaged boys (like I used to be!)"
4,A Fun Read,Vizzini is great at speaking for the young adult community. This story has an intriguing plot line and was an enjoyable read.
4,Simply Out there,Vizzini's jokes and humor never fails me on a bad day but this book was simply out there. Be ready for a ride before reading.
2,be more chill,"i bought this book because i read its kind of a funny story and i enjoyed it very much. So i thought I would like another book by the same author. This book just didnt catch my attention. It was just so blah. The main character got on my nerves because he was so pathetic. He was such a loser, and all he cared about was getting with this girl that was shallow. i couldn't relate to it at all."
2,Eh.,"Kind of disappointed with this book. Loved It's Kind of a Funny Story, so I got this book for only a cent, so I can't whine. However, I didn't connect and fully comprehend what was going on. And the ending? So dissapointed, Easy read."
4,totally misleading,"to think that this whole book is just an apology letter to christine. the squip may be an awesome hight tech micro cpu in the cranium with keanu reeves' voice, (were they even allowed to trademark him?) but it screwed up majorly on giving jeremy what he really wants. the one thing that really cracked me up was that they actually minimized the mention of his use to internet porn to 10%. as far as i am concerned though, the squip didnt even help him get laid, just ruined his life. and also wasted $500,, so complete waste"
1,I have yet to receive the first copy??????????????,I doubt you will publish my review since I have not received a single copy after several months. I will be very reluctant to buy again.
1,What subscription?,You charged me for this - and I want it - yet I still have not started receiving it. Either provide me with a subscription or refund my money.
2,Where have the good Magazines gone?,I used to receive Numismatic News when it was a newspaper and it had excellent coverage of coin news and a value section that was the standard. It has fell to a level that I consider mostly useless.J. R. Harlin
4,"Works well, tastes awful.","This tea should be treated as a laxative. I have horrible problems with bloating and cramping so i take this sometimes. I'd advise using it ONLY when you are going to be home for a long time :P And DON'T drink more than one cup a day unless its an emergency, I made that mistake once.... T_TI really hate the taste but I suppose that is probably different person to person. I think it's the senna itself I hate, not the carob(chocolate) taste, because I've tried other senna teas and they have that same disgusting flavor :/ I just drink it with my nose pinched xD"
3,Works fine. Tastes like spinach juice.,"Smooth move works fine. I like the mint better though. The chocolate tastes just like spinach juice to me. I can tolerate the taste as I like spinach; otherwise it would be a ""no go"" considering the taste."
4,The Power of Bocelli!!,"The two most wonderful things for me about this album are 1) the earlier renditions of songs I first heard on ROMANZA, which as a devoted fan are fascinating and historical, and 2) hearing that sweet and powerful voice in English singing The Power of Love...I adore the Italian language and agree that AB has his best sensibilities in his native tongue....but....WOW!!! This one knocked my socks off!!!"
2,Bocelli Import Extra,"Overall album just NOT normal quality. Not worth the money. I love Bocelli so listened again today to Sogno and Romanza and there is no comparison. Albeit, there is a rawness to the voice and simplicity of music that has some appeal."
3,Nothing Original Here!,"Do you remember Whitesnake? Well Micky Moody was the guitar player in that band a few years back. On this disc, Moody joins with old friend Paul Williams for a rather bland mix of covers in a tribute to Elmore Leonard, Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters. It's not that it's bad really, but you can hear countless coverbands in bars across the country that play these same tunes as good as, if not better, than this duo."
1,Good value if you paid 10cents,"This DVD has some cool short video clips (scenarios and erwin talking) but for the $25AUD i paid for it, it is a massive waste of money you hardly learn anything out of it and the short clips are a couple of minutes long maximum, half of them do not even make sense. There is probably all up about 30min running time on this DVD and I would recommend listening to his MOsaic podcasts on iTunes. These run for 40min+ each on each topic of which there is about 6 or 7, these podcasts are free aswell"
3,OK(ish),"It's not a bad book, really. Few actually useful classes, a few handy skills and feats but nothing to really inspire greatness. I use it occasionally but in general it tends to gather dust. Buy it for completeness, as with all of the ""complete...."" range from WotC."
2,"Might be good, but all the $$$ necessary for D&D is lame","Here's why D&D; supplements (ie SPLAT books) are good:If you want a lot of extra rules, occasionally some good new optiosn, and the ability for your players to make characters that are overpowered -- without a single magic item. And when the overpowered characters DO get an item, look out!Here's why they suck:I'm happy they pumped the Thieves & Bards ... but if you buy the D&D; game, you're looking at hundreds of dollars of books.[...]"
3,D&D Rocks!,"Been a player for almost three decades. Always seem to be a Dungeon Master and this book is helpful, though lately I tend to just sort of make up rules as I go along.For those role players who like to read, try The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This book is about a teen who role plays, goes to another world and uses the skills learned through roleplaying to help him survive. It's an action packed book that's hard to put down. Role Players rejoice!"
5,A Worthy Addition,"My husband and I have lots of supplements. I find it frusterating when many of them are geared toward situations that you have to know about in advance and they are not useful for unkown adventuring situations. Or everything is weaker than a standard class (it really burns me to pay good money for that!)This is a very good general-purpose book with some worthy classes and prestige classes. There are some reprints, of course. Overall, it it a worthy addition to any 3rd ed hoard."
4,Complete Adventurer,Complete Adventurer is a great book for players who like classes dealing with many skills it also has the Ninja and Scout both are awsome classes and have alot to add to any adventuring class. I was somewhat disapointed in the low amount of feats hints only 4 stars however everything else including the artwork is wonderful in this book.
2,Some things in this book are wrong!,This book is very well layed out however there are some things wrong.On page 36 to 39 it talks about flight control. The pictures show a wooden model with strings that pull on the different control surfaces to fly the plane. They have the controls for the Elevator and Ailerons backwards.Apart from that this is a good book.
5,An excellect induction into trance/electronica,"This collection of various artists, has so many melodic and introspective expressions, that I should think it to be most attractive to those who have never experienced the best this genre has to offer."
2,101 Best Loved Poems,101 B est Loved Poems not the volume I expected - 101 Best Loved Poems my fault for not checking more closely - move on
5,Informative,I was born and brought up in the Finger Lakes region. My ancestors on my father's side lived in Cherry Valley. My Mother's side lived in Tyron County and fought in the Battle of Oriskany. This book fills in some of our history.
5,Very Interesting Book,"I highly recomend this book, I never knew what the folks in N.Y. State had gone throughduring the Revolutionary War. It gives you a diffrent view of the Indians and British then what you are taught inSchool."
2,Case studies and confidentiality,"As one consider these case studies, I question the appropriateness of many of these case studies of public figures for various disorders. I don't know that the authors have had direct interviews with these individuals; hence, their information is mostly from secondary sources. If they did have direct interview information, it would be limited for release for public view from the usual confidentiality of provider-patient relationship, and could only be released with personal release by the patient. I think it would be ethical for the authors to be frank about the source of their information, and differentiate between primary source information, and secondary sources, which may contain biased or slanted views."
4,Great Case Studies,"The case studies are very well described and analyzed, it isn't difficult to follow along, and provides more than enough information to understand each case study. Good book to accompany any abnormal psychology class or simply to have in your bookshelf."
5,Case Studies in Abnormal Behavior,Book received in good order and as described. It was received in a timely manner and i would definitely purchase from this vendor in the future.
4,Abnormally Good,"Book came in great condition and on time. And the price was right. Good use of case studies. If you are studying Under Grad Abnormal Psych, this book would be an assett"
5,"Learn to Write and Spell, Guido!","Dr. Meyer's Case Studies is a well-written and comprehensive view of mental disorders. It is a fine supplement to any abnormal, clinical or forensic psychology class. Disregard the previous reviewer's comments. It is obvious that his political views cloud his ""scholarly"" judgment."
1,Ridicolous,"In the case studies for abnormal sexual behaviors, along with Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer, is listed that one of William Jefferson Clinton. If we consider the life of the former president an abnormal behavior instead of a political maneuvre to discredit a political opponent on an issue that it would be otherwise been accepted as a normal behavior from very many in the U.S. and abroad - many psychologists included - we teach a dangerous lesson and we set a dangerous standard. Such lesson would be very much welcomed by those people who exploit sexual personal issues to either state a twisted ethics (like Sen. Rick Santorum) or present a non-serious examination of sexual abnormal behavior, based on facts not always proved , like Mr. Meyer did in the case of Mr. Clinton."
1,I have not read it yet,"Well, this is for my class.I hate reading, so I have not read it yet.Looks very interesting if I would love reading."
5,"A Beautiful, Classic Voice from the '70's . . .","""Change in Luck."" For a young, relatively unknown studio background vocalist (in her early 20's) at the time, this was quite a breakthrough because of her 'different' range. This was her and James Newton Howard's (producer) answer to Peter Asher's (producer) Linda Ronstadt. (No comparison between the two ladies' vocal abilities, at all.) The big difference is, Valerie's voice and emotional engagement were fresh: never overly produced or overly 'commercialized.' So, I deliberately searched for Valerie Carter's ""Wild Child"" on CD: I was lucky enough to find/purchase the Japanese remastered CD. ('Thank You, Amazon!'). Timeless."
1,Huge disappointment,"There are three major problems with this tape that make it a huge disappointment: 1) it's very hard to tear; 2)when the tape is on the roll, the adhesive on one layer sticks to the next layer making it hard to unroll the tape; 3)when the tape comes off the skin it leaves numerous remnants of adhesive, usually in thin streaks of adhesive coming from the outside edges of the tape. This is my first and only experience with this tape. I would not recommend it and I won't buy it again."
3,Not what I expected,"This bathmat's color is true to the picture. The only complaint I have is that it looks just like a thin towel. There is no real substance to it and no grips on the bottom to keep it in place. So if that is what you're looking for, this is not the mat for you."
2,Just a thin towel,"I could have put a bath towel on the floor and gotten the same mediocre result; there is nothing ""luxe"" about it! Thin and does not stay in place. Be warned that the colors run when washed, even in cold water, so unless you WANT pink underwear..."
4,What really holds Archie and Wolfe together,"I love this series, especially because of the relationship between NW and AG. These two men could not be more different in terms of work ethic, personal style, taste, etc. Yet they are held together by mutual respect and -- as illustrated by this colorful installment -- a very healthy disrepect for authority. Here we find Wolfe confronted by an institution he would enjoy tweaking even more than the NYPD, and that's the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The murder itself really is not that important to the story. The real story is Wolfe's elaborate (and boy, is it ever elaborate!) plan to sting the Feds. If you're looking for a complex whodunit, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy the series and the main characters of Goodwin, Wolfe and Cramer, curl up with this one and prepare to smile often."
3,Looking tough at the FBI,"Oftentimes the Nero Wolfe books are in some never-never time. You know it's sometime after the second World War, but placing it in the fifties or sixties or seventies can be tough. Except when Stout decides to take on what later became one of his favorite subjects, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.In The Doorbell Rang, Stout gets his jabs in at the ""privileged"" position of the federal investigator, while raising issues many Americans had at the time about a ""secret police"" which reported, supposedly, only to the president. A true immigrant, Wolfe has more of a feeling for what democracy is and how precious an item it is, and works harder to defend it than the ""real"" Americans. As always, Stout's prose is clean and crisp, and this is the same book that you expect from him."
5,Nero Wolfe is Timeless Enjoyment,"If you want mindless action then leave now, Nero Wolfe mysteries are not for you. If, however, you have a love of classic detective fiction, a mind to appreciate a fine puzzle solving, a taste for gourmet meals, fine living and excentric characters--then Wolfe is your man! The most delightful thing about Rex Stouts novels is their period flavor. Stout wrote Wolfe as a ""contemporary detective"" and began his writing career in the first half of this century. A prolific writer, Stout has brought Wolfe across the decades from the WWII era to the disco days. Each novel is a unique period piece of masterful puzzle solving by a marvelously enjoyable cast of characters. Archie and Wolfe never seem to age as they cope with the times, their clients and each other in each new volume, and to the reader this is not incongruous--they are that easily well loved! Nero Wolfe will go down in history with Mycroft Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Sam Spade and Jessica Fletcher as a Classic!"
4,Wholesome Nero,"One of my favorite authors is Rex Stout who created the characters-- Nero Wolf and his side-kick Archie Goodwin. His novels have wholesome, old-fashioned themes filled with humor and good versus evil.To support a very extravagant lifestyle of gourmet food prepared by an outstanding personal chef, and thousands of orchids, Nero turns to solving crime for making a living. Archie prompts Nero to use his brain cells to problem solve.In this novel, Nero prepares and does take on the great organization--the FBI. The reader will see how Nero completes this task and later refuses to greet J.Edgar Hoover.Although I do not believe that this was Stout's best novel, I enjoyed it nevertheless."
4,Very good,"This is not one of Stout's better plots, possibly because of the artifice necessary to put together a story where Wolfe successfully takes on the FBI. However there is lots of office chatter between Wolfe and Archie, and Cramer has a nice role. Well worth a read, I think."
3,Nero Wolfe vs the FBI,"This was one of Rex Stout's more entertaining Wolfe adventures, which has the inimitable detective going up against J Edgar Hoover and the FBI. The usual plot twists, wisecracks and brilliant deductions prevail, as does Wolfe. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I will admit that I like Michael Pritchard's readings better than the reader on this one, but that was a minor quibble."
4,Can't think of a better detective than Nero Wolfe,"Rex Stout came up with a winner in Nero Wolfe. Archie and Nero combine for some of the best mystery/suspense reading possible. This book involves Wolfe with the most dangerous guys possible, the FBI. How he gets himself into and out of this mess is great to read. The book is full of excellent characters and no one can write a suspense story like Rex Stout."
2,Thermo,"Very difficult reading. You must navigate pages of ""fluff"" reading just to get to an important point. Skip the wording and get to the point please!!! The example problems do not even start to prepare you for the chapter problems.....never mind the review problems!! This book will give you a very basic idea of what is going on but you must spend too much time re-reading most sections to understand what this guy is talking about."
2,Nice try,The book invites its readers to a boring ride into the world of thermodynamics. The lengthy texts are trying desperately to draw its readers a clear picture of this popular science but only make matter worse. The exercises of this book seem difficult and time consuming not because the concepts are hard to grasp but only due to lack of explainatary examples.
5,Magnificent,The Whispers are the greatest. I love their music. This particular cdhas some of their greatest songs. This is a must have.
5,The Whispers Greatest Hits,"This is my favorite cd. The whipers have good beats and sing very good as well, how come they are thought of very little. They deserve much more for this musical masterpiece.Highlights of this cd are: Living together(In sin), And the beat goes on, Its a love thing, Tonight( my favorite song on here) and Rock steady.The Whispers changed musical styles all the time but never failed to get me dancin. There are no bad songs on here. If you like R and B you will love this. I am only fourteen and I like this music. Pick this up right away. You wont be dissapointed."
5,expect the best,"This is the whispers, what do you expect. CD packed with nice tracks. What else can you say about this group-they just get better and better with time."
1,Too tiny for chickens,"The grill directions say that you can cook a 5 pound chicken in it. We managed to cook one, after trussing the chicken up like a captured bandit. We have not been able to replicate the act with any other chickens, even those weighing less than 5 pounds....we tie up their wings and their legs tight with string, but the bird keeps hitting the back of the grill, and the rotisserie refuses to turn. I thought my husband was going to throw the grill across the kitchen; he tried for 30 minutes to get the chicken to turn, to no avail. I wish I hadn't bought the darned thing....it was a waste of money."
4,Good artistic foreign film,"Not much in the way of dialogue in this film. It's sort of like a musical, Latin-style. The girl is some nice eye candy, very sexy. It's a love triangle between a girl and two guys. A lot of nudity and sex, but tastefully, passionately done. The movie was really very well done from a cinematic standpoint. Set in Monterrey, Mexico."
2,I hate these pans,"Not only do they appear splotchy after you use them once, but the skillet is horrible as everything sticks to it no matter how low the heat is. If you oil it or use butter you have to use so much that the food is ruined. My husband and I paid $400 for these pans and we wish that we paid $150 for a cheap set as they seem to work better. The lids are another issue as they are hard to store because of the handles. The pans look nice when you first buy them but after a couple of uses that too goes away. we have owned these pans for a year now and this weekend we are going out to buy another set of skillet pans to replace the Calphalon onessince we argue about these pans so much. Do not buy!"
1,Junk,"These are truly the worst cookware I have ever used. It doesn't matter how low of heat used when cooking, everything sticks to the cooking surfaces. I think cooking an egg on my cement driveway would stick less than on these pans. Don't let the price and the shinny surfaces fool you...these are junk! The only thing that doesn't stick to these pans is boiling water. I feel embarrassed, since I purchased these pans as a family Christmas present...save your money and buy a cheaper set of cookware!!!!!!"
5,I LOVE THIS!,"I abso-flipping-lutely love this! I have no idea why I have never heard of this until I ran across it in the beauty aisle. I used this when I blow dried my hair and then straightened it with Chi silk infusion and my hair is silky, bouncy & glorious! This is one of my new faves!!!"
5,Profound but sobering impact,"I was first introduced to this book in 1970, in a high school class. The concept of ""reification"", whereby a manmade item is given a cosmic status, was important to me then and still is now. As for some others, the book inspired me to become a sociology major. The thinking, along with the related book The Sacred Canopy, greatly challenged my religious beliefs, as the man-made quality all such beliefs and doctrines becomes apparent. The thinking has also helped me navigate through many conflicts without giving into the man-made reality of the majority. If one truly wants to be an individual, or believes in liberation, this book is essential."
5,A book I wish I had written,"This book led me into a life of sociology as it encouraged me to pursue and complete a Ph.D. in this discipline. On my first reading as an undergraduate, this book brought together many disparate ideas I had been thinking for sometime. I recently re-read it and still find it fascinating and important. It's contributions are detailed by other reviewers, I would only add that I consider a great bulk of the post-modernist movement to be summarized, detailed and challenged in a coherent and succinct fashion here."
4,Social construction of reality as autopoietic action,"Authors Berger and Lukmann are pioneers and in fact founders of theory that can provoke almost everebody to become subject of His/her life! They inspired me to connect biology, philosophy, psychology, technology, economy, and law! Without their approach i could not recognize autopoiesis of these disciplines, hidden similarities in processes and structures! They with this book inspired many others, but we followers should try to self-organize ourselves and create synergy. Can we? Do we want it? Do we know how to (self)produce theory and methodology of autopoietic society?"
1,Be aware of American Seiko Services!,"If you need to replace a used battery you will be charged at least $45 plus shipping and handling!If you do not pay the $40 waterproof test you will lose that feature!More than that, they had broken the watch's cronograph and their quality control (do they have one?!)did nothing! I do not recommend you buying this kind of Seiko watches!"
2,Never had this problem before,These numbers got here on time but at the finish of the race started to fall apart on some of the sweaty runners. I had the stub on a spindle as the runners came into the chute but some of the stubs fell apart at the hole.Luckily these pieces had names on them so I could place them. I will insist on pure Tyvek numbers next time.
2,Squirrel NOT proof,Either we've got some REALLY smart squirrels or there's a flaw in this product's design. The brackets that close the top of this otherwise well designed globe is a weak point. Squirrels always find the weakest point in a feeder's openings. These furry tailed rats were able to easily overcome the top metal brackets and open the top lid of the feeder since there was no other back-up lock on the lid. Good news....fix the two metal top brackets and you've built a better 'mouse trap'...or squirrel proof globe in this case.
5,Excellent cookware,"I've had the pleasure of owning this set for the past 6+ years and they leave me wanting nothing. They cook fantastic, are incredibly durable, look great and are easy to clean. My only complaint would be when cooking things for a long time with the lids on the handle for the lids get hot to the touch, but not hot enough to burn you, just hot. We've added more individual Calphalon Contemporary pots to our arsenal over the years including a few of the non-stick contemporary pans, while they do have their purpose, I prefer the stainless steel pans for nearly everything. The SS pans are far more durable than the non-stick, while the non-stick are great non-stick pans if this were the non-stick set we'd probably be replacing it due to wear. These pans don't carry the flashy All-Clad name, but I have no complaints and don't feel pressure to upgrade."
3,"We are open minded, BUT.....","This book just did not do it for us. We purchased this book (and Sweet Life: Erotic Fantasies for Couples) based on the reviews from other couples and women. We were sorely disappointed. But maybe our type of fantasies are different from others. Male-Male Bisexuality and enemas do not fit our view point of erotic fantasies.However, based on the writing style, the stories are well written. We gave this 3 stars because the fantasies are just not our type, but the writing style is VERY well done.Just not for us."
3,Exciting Read but Difficult for Some,"The stories are written very well. As I read and shared with my spouse she expressed a reluctance to go down some of the paths provided in the book. That does not mean the book is bad, but it did prevent me from realizing full value from it. After looking at some of the review for Sweet Life 1 I am going to go back and purchase that and see if we can work our way up to Sweet Life 2."
4,game set,the product is a really nice game set. I have always wanted one for our bbq but could not find a nice one. This is a really nice product and it was a good price for everything that you get.
2,Not what I had expected,"I ordered this based on the Franklin name and the one review it had. I was looking for a whole outdoor game set up, but this was not what I expected. The horseshoes are thin, hollow plastic (a strong wind could blow them away!), the frisbee is nowhere near regulation size, net poles were flimsy, etc, etc. Everything about this set was cheesey and cheap. It got shipped back the same day as delivery. When looking at these things always remember, you get what you pay for...."
2,Ugh...,"I got this printer because it seemed like a great deal for an all-in-one. I mostly just wanted a printer that could print photos from my digital camera. However, I wasted 6 pieces of photo paper before I got a DECENT photo. The previous 5 were either faded (too light), too dark, or just really bad quality. Printing on normal paper didnt seem to work too well either. The colors didnt match what was on my computer screen and I had to ""align"" the cartidges quite a few times. The only thing I liked was the scanner and the fact that you only need one cartridge for this printer. Its nice if you are only printing for personal needs, but not for photos or school/work related prints."
4,You get what you pay for,"Come on people, it's a $35 all-in-one printer. What did you expect? My first All-In-One cost me $200 and the ink was $30 a pop. If you want photo quality, buy a cheap epson ""Photo"" printer. For the price, this is a great deal. It's cheaper to operate (ink, one cartridge) and it gets the job done. If you want a top notch printer than you need to pay a top notch price for it. If you want something cheap and handy that gets the job done at a cheaper price then this is the printer for you."
5,GREAT PRINTER!!!!!!!!,"I finally found the printer i been looking for! It works great, scans and prints fast and clear. Only uses one ink cartraige which is great! I love it."
4,I got what I paid for!,"This was my ""protest printer"" after suffering from ink inflation for years. I bought the X2350 at Target for $30 and got a free cordless phone ""premium"" in the box about two years ago. If I want photos, I Web my .jpgs to Snapfish, pay 12-cents and get great prints. But for everyday documents I get very acceptable printouts from the X2350 and thumb my nose at HP and Epson every time I hit the print button. I just hope Kodak's new one-cart printer compels Lexmark to keep on making the X2350 which, yes, is a disposable that has outlived my expectations and still makes good prints, excellent copies, an even an occasional photo on glossy paper. Go Lexmark...go Kodak...screw the ink pirates."
1,Lexmark disappointing,"This printer was brought to my attention for use in our media center. We presently have a Z12 hooked up to one of our desktops. We had an X83, I believe, Lexmark scanner, copier, product. Both have been extremely unreliable in their preformance and reliability. We will not be purchasing any more Lexmark products. We rely on our printers to work properly the first time. When I'm in the middle of research or putting my thoughts on paper, and the printer interrupts with a malfunction, time and time again; I'm prone to not consider this brand when shopping for a replacement."
1,Dont Buy It!!!!,This printer is given free if you buy a computerI got mine for free but for those who want to buy it please dont buy it!Reasons why-Horrible quality pictures in color or black-spots of blue red or purple appear on the pictures-Black letters appear dark purple and theres spots on the letters of blue and red-other colored letters like red or green appear faded-Takes too long to print a regular picture (about 15 secs for one picture)The only thing i see thats good about it is that the scan quality is okay and its quiet ENOUGH
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"First off, it prints dark green or brown and not true black the prints come out very grainy and faded as if you are looking at them through tissue paper,the cartridges run out very quickly at 20 bucks a pop thats a rip. Calls to lexmark make yyou jump thru several hoops before getting actual help from a third world country tech assistant who is reading a manual to get answers for you. [...]"
2,Not such a big deal.,"In this case I must emphasize that the following comments of listeners convinced me to make the mistake of buying this CD. The soundtrack does not give what it promised to deliver. The music is not plain and simple,meaning that it's a mixture of tunes that does'nt sound right.I found it hard to enjoy it,even though I admire the show,and by all means it's music. To make things clear - This is not melodies taken untouched from TV.They were reeingineered to become ""special""-exacly what ruined the originality of the music.If you like the music of the show as it is don't buy this one.""Messages from earth"" is better by far."
5,Soulful and Silky Classic,The Whispers come at you again with a sound that is vibrant but filled with evening light melodies. They take you up with 'keep on lovin me' and mellow you out with 'keep your love around'! Too smooth!
4,beautiful ballad,"This CD contains the beautiful ballad ""Had it not been for you"" That song alone makes this CD worth owning."
2,Surprised by poor production quality,"I haven't gotten a chance to delve into the content yet, but I was surprised by the poor production quality on this book given the cover price. Looks like it was typeset in Word and printed on a laser printer."
3,Paperback version doesn't have the cases,"The only reason I bought the book was for a class and I bought it online because it was way cheaper. THe trick of it was the paperback version doesn't have the cases inside, which go figure, are the most important part of my class. Now I have to photocopy them ore order them offline through my professor."
4,Great Book,This was my MBA text book and I found the content very nicely organized with plenty of topical references to recent business happenings which made the application meaningful and raised lots of related issues in the class room.I would give it 4 stars!
1,Reggae Emporer,"This is a bogus Lee Perry CD - bootlegged from a more legitimate release on Heartbeat, ""Lord God Muzick""."
1,STIM-U DENT,"I believe that Amazone misrepresent this product, which was shown as mint flavored Johnson & Johnson Stim-u-dents. The product sent to me was made in China and was not mint flavored. I believe that I should receive a full refund for a product thatStim-U-Dent Plaque Removers, Mint Flavor 4 - 25 packs [100 picks] (Pack of 10)was totally misrepresented and of inferior quality."
3,Good Product,This product was for years sold by Johnson&Johnson and was of higher quality and tasted more minty than does the current offering distributed by Revive and made in China.
4,Stimu-Dent Review,My husband loves these things and they are really hard to find at any stores here. They have helped his gums alot and I think they have saved him from having any more surgeries. This price is really good too. When I do find them in Denver they are 3 to 4 dollars a pack and this price averages out just under 2 dollars.
2,Made in China,"The product I received is distributed by Revive Personal Products...not Johnson and Johnson. It states it is Made in China. Don't like the quality. Much cheaper feel to it. Was afraid I'd get a sliver from them. Won't re-order. Don't know why I can't find the J&J Stim-U-dents in any store (Jewel-Osco, Walgreens, etc., anymore."
3,One good song on this CD,"I love 'I saw you first' on this CD, which is what I bought it for, but I'm not really enjoying the other songs on this single. It arrived in good time & good condition though."
4,Larry Wallis - 'Death In The Guitar Afternoon' (Ribbed),"Talk about rock & roll's true unsung heros. I've heard about this Larry Wallis solo effort before and now I finally got to listen to a copy of this disc by the (original Motorhead guitarist as well as past member of Pink Fairies and the Deviants). Impressive! Tunes that did it for me were ""Are We Having Fun Yet?"", ""Dead Man Riding"", the energetic ""Where The Freaks Hang Out"" (great song title), ""Mrs. Hippy Burning"" and ""I'm A Police Car"". Good underground UK psych to emotionally thoroughly 'take' in. Give this one a try."
5,ESSENTIAL. . . .,"ALL RIGHT!!! Yes, this is truly great -- inspired lyrics, playing, singing -- smart as hell sans pretensions -- the essence of R&R. And very worth the dough (which you could easily spend on a few beers and then pee away -- remember: arse longa, birra brevis). DON'T DELAY -- BUY IT TODAY!!!"
5,A Musical Masterpiece!,"Anyone that disses this song either has no good taste in music or simply hasn't even heard it. The song, the cover art, the video...Kelly is slowly blossoming into one of the worlds biggest electro goddesses as we speak. I expect that she should strike it big with this brilliant slice of dancey electronica goodness. I eagerly anticipate the release of her second album, 'Sleeping In The Nothing' on June 7, 2005.AMAZING!"
1,never recieved my cd,well i never recieved my cd they said it was mailed but i never got it and no one gave me any feedback on what happened
2,One Word? More like Fade to Grey....,"This is a good song, too bad it was already written by Visage under the name ""Fade to Grey"".""One Word"" is basically a cover, operating under another name...without permission.I don't get why the writer of One Word didn't just make it a cover, it's as if she thought no one would catch on.Pop music has become this monster, where people just come out with recycled songs, written behind the scenes and then performed by usually untalented front people.I mean Kelly Osbourne can't even sing, they have to over process her voice so much it's not even funny anymore. Go check out the original, I'm not saying don't listen to this version, but it's good to know the truth.This probably would have gotten 3-4 stars from me if it was original or honest."
1,Song is awesome but you can find this elsewhere minus the video for a reasonable price...,It amazes me how people try to rip people off on amazon! Amazon needs to step up and set some limits here! To sale this for $99 is an insult when you can find the original with remixes for .99!I will never buy anything from this seller.
1,"Are the writers of ""Fade to gray"" get their part of the cake?",This is a rip-off. The bad thing is that many young people have never heard abut Visage. I hope a lawsuit against the writer of Kelly's song (Linda Perry). What a nerve!!!!
4,Fantastic Single From A 4-Star Album!,"I can't believe that ""One Word"" is not a #1 hit! But I guess as long as most people focus on WHO kelly is instead of WHAT she can do that'll never be. ""One Word"" is very 80s, very Madonna... GOOD MADONNA... not the techno-pap-crap Madonna we have now."
4,Amazingly good,"When my wife asked me to find this song, I thought she meant Kelly Clarkson, I couldn't understand why she would want ANYTHING from Kelly Osbourne. I myself don't listen to much mainstream stuff..but this is one track that I will have on rotation for awhile. Not to shabby Ms. Osbourne"
4,Homage to Visage,"I like the song One Word. It gets a good response when I spin it during an 80's set. As a writer and musician though, I really hope the album gives credit to Visage's Fade to Gray. It had the EXACT same melody--just different words. Kelly's song really is the same song. Again, I'll hold out my opinion until I read the album credits."
5,Awesome,"This single is awesome. This single was the first and only single to be #1 on Billboards Dance/Club Play, Dance Radio Singles Chart, and Dance Singles Sales chart at the same time.Do we have a new dance diva in the making?Anyway, this song is slickly produced, dancable and electronically fascinating."
1,A Complete Waste of Money!,"After less than 1 year, the first F11 I bought had the display freeze up. To Polar's credit, they replaced it under warranty. The second F11 was unable to pick up the signals from the WearLink transmitter. I replaced the battery, but it still didn't work! Had to buy a T31 coded tranmitter (another $50), which then worked.Now my second F11's display has frozen!I have a Polar S210 for cycling that was purchased in 2000 that still works as well as the day I bought it-replaced the battery twice. Also have my first very basic Polar HRM purchased in 1993, and it still works, I know the company puts out quality products, but in this case I fell for the marketing hype and the added features (most of which I don't use).In my opinion, the F11 is a lemon. Don't buy it."
4,Polar Exercise watch,I bought this for my wife. She loves it. She likes the exercise programs with details of burned calories and how many calories to go to meet one's personal goal. There are tons of other features she had not usued nor will ever use but she's very happy with it. Only downside is that to download results onto PC you need a microphone attached to your PC. Workout results are sent from watch to PC via sound.
4,Great Product,"Very good monitor, convenient, accurate, lots of features, no problems! The chest strap is very comfortable. The only improvement I can think of would be to have a better strap for the watch, something softer and more flexible than the plastic one it comes with. It looks like it could be fitted with a another strap but I have not tried it."
2,I loved it until ...,"I loved this heart rate monitor. Yes, it does have reliability issues. But I was able to overlook that. It felt like I had my own personal trainer. It was a nice gadget. I loved tracking my workout progress. Then after a month and a half of everyday use. It died. Maybe I just had a bad one. But if I'm going to spend $150 and it is only going to last a month. I don't think it is worth it."
5,silverware holder,This is my second purchase of one of these. Purchased one for our local golden years club also one for our HCE club. Delighted.
5,Rings are fun!,"This book has all you need to know and more about juggling rings. The rings even come with the book to get you started right away, and the instructions are comical, clear and easy to learn! Dr. Bob has created a great package for the beginner juggler to reach new heights (literally). If you are a juggler and haven't yet tried rings this book is for you!"
2,PONCE DE LEON DIDN'T FIND IT,"Friends, if there such a thing as ""age reversal"" or a fountain of youth, I'd be right there by that flowing spring filling my jug. But, to my knowledge there is not a fountain of youth nor is there a cream capable of age reversal.At best an eye cream moisturizes, serves to hydrate and some firm skin around the eyes. But there should be no pulling and tugging of that delicate area, and this cream must be ""worked in.""I don't think so."
1,unlikeable characters,"For me it's tough sell when I don't like the characters. More importantly, I don't like a story that moves forward by the characters constantly making bad choices. I hated the ending."
4,Good rescource,"This is a very good, informative rescource, however it is very short (only 36 pages). Aside from that, the information that it gives is good, concise, clear, and it is full of refrences of other books/studies on the subject of autism."
2,Latin Literature,"I bought the book on December 31st but it didn't get to me until January 14th. When it did, the spine was broken. If I didn't need the book for a class, I would have returned it."
4,Where to get additional Princess Ballerinas,"You can get the additional Princess Ballerinas (magnet ones) at the Fisher Price Online store. It includes Snow White, Cinderalla, Ariel and Belle for $18.00. [...]"
5,My daughters favorite Christmas Present!!,"Anyone that has a little girl must invest in this toy. My daughter got this for christmas (she is 2) and LOVES it! It comes with just cinderella and I cannot wait until I can get the other dancing princesses. My daughter loves to push the button and twirl around at the same time as cinderella does, its Soooooo cute. This toy is one of the cutest toys I've seen! Oh and one little tid bit, if the ballerina starts to get stuck on the ramp or on the dance floor just clean it with pledge and she is good to go!"
4,WHERE IS JASMINE,"My 4 year old daughter loves this toy. I have to admit I am quite amused by the whole arrangement. It's a great toy, but where are the princesses? I have searched high and low and finally I have four, but no Jasmine. I can't believe Fisher Price has made these assessories impossible to find. I was annoyed at first because it only comes with one which meant I had to go store to store looking for all these pieces which means more money. I searched Fisher Price's web-site and they don't even allow you to purchase it off their page. And I guess I'm still looking for Jasmine because she is the only ethnic looking one and my daughter identifies with her the most. What's up with that? Where is Jasmine?"
2,Extra Ballerinas are Gone,"If you bought this toy in 2004 and RUSHED out to get the extra dolls, you are generally happy with it, as you will see in the reviews below. But if you bought it post 2005, when the extra dolls were no longer available (although the ballet studio is still in stores) you'll have either 1) have a very lonely Cinderlla twilling around the floor, or 2) a very angry Mommy or Daddy who need to shell out (...)these now ""rare"" ""collectors item."
4,"Fun, but a pain to keep together.","We got this for my daughter for her 4th birthday last week. She really enjoys the ballerinas dancing. She gets up and dances along. My 2 year old daughter is also enjoying this toy.My beef with it is that, like the others, the back will not stay on for anything. I feel like I fix it a hundred times a day.As for finding all the princesses, Jasmine was the hardest to find, but I located her at Kohl's, on sale to boot. Just today I saw her at Wal-Mart. So don't give up she's out there!"
3,Looking for Princess Jasmine?,"I just bought the new Aladdin DVD today. In the package is a booklet of special offers and coupons, specifically one for ""Ballerina Jasmine"" for $2.50. Hope this helps (of course, in true capitalist Disney style, you have to buy another Disney product to find out about this!)"
5,where are the other princesses?,"I purchased this for my two year old daughter for christmas, as she loves anything to do with princesses. However I have yet to find any of the other princesses that go with this set. There is one doll that comes with the studio, but one isn't as much fun as two, or three, or even four! So where are they? How do we get them?"
4,Cute toy but frustrates my girls,"This is a really cute toy with a great concept. The 2 big drawbacks are: 1. This only comes with 1 ballerina and the other dolls are hard to find.2. The stage only holds 3 dolls at a time so, it became very frustrating for my 2yr old when she couldn't get all 5 dolls to spin at the same time.Over all, this is a really cute toy for little girls."
3,3 stars,"Even though my daughters really like playing with this toy I am very unhappy that the other princess ballerina dolls are not available in the stores. I have checked with all retailers in my area and some stated that they don't remember ever carring the dolls seperately. The ballet studio is still available in several retail stores in my area but the ballerinas were discontinued in 2004. So don't buy this item and believe what is stated on the front of the box, the additional dolls are not available to be purchased seperately!!!"
4,Princess Ballet Studio,"Santa brought this for my 17 month old who desperately wanted something princess of her own like big sister. They both play with it and LOVE it! I was able to find all the extra princesses at Target. We got Jasmine with the Aladdin DVD, but I later saw her at Target also. I also had the same problem with the back of it staying together. A little super glue fixed that problem! Overall it was worth the money to see my girls' enjoyment!"
3,Jasmine Oh Jasmine,Here in NJ Kohl's does not have the Jasmine doll.I have all the other ones though. THey are so cute. However in searching for Jasmine I found hope with the info on the Aladdin DVD. ALas my daughters did away with the pamphlet. [...] We love you FOrever !!
5,"A must read if you are a fan of the movie ,The Searchers""","(review starts with Comanche war cry...)This book was out of print for years , I paid 70 bucks for aHC 1st print on e bay I wanted it so bad.. it was worth it!A week later I cam here and saw it was due to be back in print...The plot of the book differs significantly from the movie at times but it doesn't take away from the pacing and the story is solid.I agree with all the reviewers above except for the one's that didnt give it 5 stars(whats the matter with you?).I also appreciate the job , Frank S Nugent (screenwriter of the film) and the job he did adapting it ..he really polished it up to make a good MOVIE of The Searchers. I want audio books of all Le May's classics .. ahh but who will read them ..."
1,Not very fun,Comes apart easily - easy to damage (it's targeted at 2 year olds but is not durable enough for them).I rate Duplos as better for 2 year olds - Dupolos are more fun as they allow more opportunities to build. Bob sets are not worth the money - get Duplos instead!
1,My broken Amazon keyboard,"Had this DSI wireless keyboard with built-in trackball mouse for two weeks of moderate use and it no longer receives signals from the sender unit. I am now back to a Logitech wireless with stand alone mouse. Should have known better than to have gotten away from the big boys brands. If this new Logitech works as well as my old one ..... oh, wait that one from ten years ago still works fine! DSI sucks.[...]"
1,Was happy initially for a month and then it stopped working all of a sudden,"Was happy initially for a month and then it stopped working all of a sudden.There is no company name or contact id or phone number or warranty!!!!I don't know what to do, whom to contact as no information is available.I tried googling it out but could not find any info."
4,battery cover,The unit works fine but the cheap china plastic cover does not snap in to hold the batteries in place. I have to use duct tape.
1,Not a good product at all.,"This is a bad product, extremely cheap plastic. In my case, it did not work at all right out of the box. Moreover, there is no documentation provided with the product. I do not recommend this product at all.Instead, I recommend ""Playstation 3 Cordless MediaBoard Keyboard."" Not only it is cost-effective compare to this one but extremely good and works with a PC or MAC as well as PS3 for which it is designed. Logitech did a great job with ""Playstation 3 Cordless MediaBoard Keyboar."" Buy that instead of this one.Playstation 3 Cordless MediaBoard Keyboard"
1,Great Idea; Crap Quality and Support,"We love the design and ease of use of this keyboard, but less than a year into its service, it died. The company is nowhere to be found, the warranty useless. This time around, we bought the non-knockoff version (Adesso) and I recommend you do, too. They have a full website and an easy to find RMA process.Fair Warning: Find something else and don't waste your money on this product!"
1,"Poor quality, buy something different if you can","Cons:1) Sometimes it stops to work and the only way to get it back is to reboot the system (on my system in average once every two days)2) Keyboard is not responsive and looses letters while typing, even if I type slowly. I'm using it right now and what it follows is the previous sentence typed at my normal speed without corrections: ""Keboard is not responsiveand loosesletters while tping even if I tpe slowl""(Note that I'm only 3 feet (1 m.) far from the receiver)3) No manual. I had to discover how to sync the keyboard with the receiver browsing the Web for 20 min. (note that the procedure changes according to the serial number)Pros:1) Ergonomic designI would not buy it again, I'm keeping it because I use it only as remote for my home theater."
4,"Works as expected, easy to install and use","Got this little baby for my home theater PC because I didnt want to always be searching for a mouse with a 15 month old in the house who has a fetish for PC Mice that loves to hide them. Keyboard works great, some times button pushes don't register, but for the amount of typing I do with this keyboard it isnt a big deal. It also seems to randomly come unlinked to the receiver, which is sort of a pain to reach to push the button in my receiver rack. However, the feel of the keyboard itself and the action of the scroll ball is great, very smooth and easy to use, even for my young daughter. Recommended."
3,review,This is what I was looking for in functionality so me meets that criteria. It is generic looking and feeling. Seems to work at a good distance.The thing that brings it down is the fact that I have to reconnect to the receiver everytime I reboot. I want to be able to turn on the computer and not have to sync them to get it to work. It should automatically just connect and work.
1,Don't waste your time,Worked for one week. No manufacturer information to be found anywhere on this item. Another piece of junk from China.
4,Wireless/trackball,"this keyboard is just as advertised. works with Linux, Ubuntu and windows vista right out of the box. keys are a little stiff but very functional."
4,Great multimedia keyboard,"We got this keyboard to serve as the main control for the computer we have connected to our TV. It works great. Signal strength is strong, even across a large living room, and key placement is handy. The only problem that we have had is that the battery door won't close after batteries were installed (doesn't fit). We just pulled out duct tape and have had no residual problems (until we need to change batteries, I guess)."
4,Pretty good keyboard,"I use this to access my desktop machine from the comfort of my sofa. My monitor is on a table next to the sofa, so I can lean back in the sofa and use the keyboard and trackball without having to lean over a table. It works really well. I do have some small issues with a couple of things. #1) when it goes into sleep mode, you have to click a button to wake it up, and that click actually DOES go through to the computer. I guess that should be expected, but when I use the ""left click"" button just to get my cursor back, I better hope that the cursor didn't stop working above something I really don't want to click. #2) it does have some issues with typing too fast and missing letters. It also does have some interference with other USB devices on the same hub as far as not transmitting all the keystrokes. Also, some items interfere with the RF transmission, again ending up with missing keystrokes. This can get VERY annoying at times.In general, a really good product."
3,Where is the power switch,"I believe who developed this keyboard was in hurry, he forgot the power switch, and without this switch you need to change the battery every day. not so smart i guess.Apart from this, its nice and easy to be used, very handy when you want to do multiple tasks.Not good for gamingNothing so speacial about it excet the wheel mouse and other side bottoms."
1,Electronic piece of junk,"it was working fine, had it always on my desk infront of the monitor, and after 2 weeks it just stopped working!! i changed the batteries, and hooked it up to another computer, and it did not work.DO NOT BUY THIS KEYBOARD."
4,Summer's Mother's Touch Infant Bouncer,"Review by Grandma for Myah age 7wks. Like the sound and vibration features but love the bounce feature the most. No longer have to use my foot to rock the bouncer. Easy to put together, seems comfortable to Myah. I wish the sides were higher and the canopy was very hard to snap in place and I hesitate to unsnap it to make it stay back. The safety T strap is a little hard to unsnap with one hand as you have to undo both sides to get it out of the way if you have a sleeping baby in your hands which makes it a little inconvenient but i would rather have one that is to hard then to easy and not safe. I would recommend this bouncer to anyone."
5,A tremendous asset to teachers and students,"This is the book of choice for use in my classroom. Students find it easy to use and understand. For my purposes, I find the book to be logically arranged and clearly written. It is very accessible, and I encourage students, teachers, and philologists alike to use it.Rocco DormarunnoInstructor, College of New Rochelle"
1,doesn't work,i don't know if the chargers doesn't work or they don't work for the zen vision m. i ordered 2 chargers and both of them don't charge my zen vision m.
1,Dosn't Work,Does no charge Zen Vision M. Light comes on on charger but does not power on vision m or charge vision m. Piece of junk. Charger not Zen.
5,MoS does it again!!!,"Once again Ministry of Sound has taken over my body, mind and soul with thier compilation of expertly mixed tunes courtesy of Tall Paul....'Everything I Play', 'All I Do', '7 Colours', 'Infinity': these songs grab hold & just don't let go! This 2 disc set is so dancy and fun it NOT leave my CD changer for quite a while! A Note: The first disc is a lil' lighter & fun than the second, harder disc.....I listen to Disc 2 first & to get me amped & come down with the second. ENJOY! (I know I do.)"
4,Mostly Great - Mostly New,"Don't misunderstand me -- this Clubbers Guide is beautifully mixed & balanced -- & a great way to sample a lot of the U.K. dance chart at once. Great cuts include the Schiller, X-Press 2, Agnelli & Nelson, & Rui da Silva selections. However, a number of tracks also appear in the Ministry of Sound Annual 2000 (Hatiras, Santos, etc.) and one (Junior Jack) was in last year's Clubber's Guide. While I am enjoying this compilation more than Cream Anthems 2001 (which seems to have more of a pop feel) the fact that some of the tracks have appeared in other MOS releases keeps me from giving it a top rating."
3,Up and down outing from MOS,"Ministry bombard us with yet another compilation, which is not a bad thing as in general I find them to be a good way to wind up an evening. This time round the provided tunes are a mix of chart toppers, club tunes and a couple of fillers. My main problem with this CD is that it never really gets going for an extended period of time, the studio work appears to have broken up the levels of adrenalin. While a good CD I would say it pales in comparison to last years Guide to 2000."
4,Slightly better than average Ministry of Sound...,"Hard moving collection of soulful house and trance, well mixed but a little too commercial sounding. After all, Fatboy Slim practically comes on AOL free-trial disks anymore. But if you don't buy many party CD's and you want to know what's current in the UK, there is plenty of thumping, polished new club material on here. I prefer Pete Tong's Essential 2000 Mix (with the plaid cover) as it has most of the best tracks, plus some better ones, ie: Sister Bliss and Trisco."
1,fool me once.. shame on u.. fool me twice.. shame on me,this is the last ministry of sound cd i will buy. almost all the songs on cd 1 are just endless boring loops of synth and drums. if a club actually played this music people would be heading for the door. there are only two songs worthwhile in the whole set. i would pass on this mess.
4,analogsf,an old pro like robert taylor plays a good portrayal as colonal tibbs doing his part to bring an end to world war two.
4,Dramatic portrait!,"Paul Tibbets-Enola Gay both names that mean part of the history. This is an absorbing subject, carefully handled about the officer who piloted and drooped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.Even I think Taylor wasn't the most appropriate actor for this role, ( I just can think in three names for that moment: Robert Donat, Fredric March and Michael Redgrave) and the film surely would have elevated to a major status.The only default to my mind is the real nightmare derived from this action; the awful sequels that surrounded the mind and personality of Tibbets are simply absent. There was a very long introduction showing the backgrounds.A well supporting cast accompanied him. Good point for Melvin Frank.Two years later after this film was released, the American journalist William Bradford Huie wrote the most documented text about this subject. Try to get this important historic testimony."
3,An oldie,"I saw this movie many years ago as a teenager and felt it was great. However, after working on nukes in the USAF and studing the history of the A bomb it is really quite inacurrate."
4,"Paul Tibbets: Soldier, Servant, Spouse","Above and Beyond is the story of Col. Paul Tibbets. This courageous man flew the Enola Gay and dropped the first atomic bomb, destroying Hiroshima. It reveals the host of complex, practical problems that he was personally responsible to overcome, but is much more. It is also an intimate portrait of the impact of his work on his marriage and family. The secrecy of the project, his patriotic allegiance to his country, and his fervent desire to see the war come to as swift a conclusion as possible all combined to create a relentless attack on his relationship with his wife. This unintended picture of the difference between how men and women see marriage is the film's greater strength. The military aspect of the film is fascinating; the familial aspect is compelling. Robert Taylor was an incredibly underrated actor. Eleanor Parker was always good and always lovely. Only the technical limitations of the 1950s film production reduce the rating to 4 stars."
5,Cows & Montana,If you like cattle and Montana this is a great book for the background story of that great land.
4,Good for what you get,"I picked up one of these when Belkin had a mail in rebate for it. For what I paid for it, it's more than made up for the cost. It takes a bit of setup and fiddling to get it exactly right, but the end result can REALLY simplify your game-play experience. Mundane tasks or complicated keystrokes are consolidated down into one button.The thumb positioned arrow pad and the scroll-wheel/throttle are not optimally placed (this is fixed in the n52), but I find I often don't need them.If you can pick this guy up cheap, this will do the job very well. Otherwise, spend a few extra bucks and get the n52."
4,Scary and fun,"I love flipping through this, although I wish he had updated it before he died. There are so many new theories...As the daughter of a severe paranoid, I grew up in FEAR, constant FEAR of THEM!! ooooooohhhh, Scaarrrry stuff! The thing I love about RAW is his ability to get me to the point where I think, ""f*** it, why waste time worrying?"""
5,I Love Can't Wait to see if an Updated Version comes About....,This book contains most of the Conspiracy Theories you can think of and its interesting. Someone at work told be about the book after I overheard her talking about it. The only issue I have is when is there going to be an updated version that will include September 11th and some of the other events that have occured since the last book was published.
3,A reading companion for fans of Illuminatus! trilogy,"The book is a sort of encyclopedia about secret organizations (funny that so much is known about them), conspiracies, and other themes familiar to readers ofThe Illuminatus! Trilogy. Text has been written in a semi-serious spirit, and should be to the taste of the fans of the aforementioned trilogy. As a general source of information perhaps not quite five-star stuff."
5,The inimitable Wilson does it again.,"Over the years Robert Anton Wilson has amused and amazed us with his vast knowledge and expertise in fields that are better left untrodden by most writers , philosophers and speculators. From the Illuminati series, through Prometheus Rising and so many others, he has taken us all on a wild roller coaster ride of imagination and literary magic. His writings are very similar to a book by author Lee Frank titled, Next: A Poetic Odyssey. Both Lee Frank And Robert Anton Wilson are great conspiracy writers."
5,Very good source of info,"I got this book some time back I just re-opend it and got back into it.I am still shcoked at the fullness of information it holds. For me it reads like a dictionary, as to a book within itself. Nevertheless, it is a great book. It kills alot of the myth as to what may or may not be a conspiracy."
2,Expected A Whole Lot More,I waited 2 weeks for this book and I was quite anxious to read it. When it came I was very disappointed at the shallow reporting and total lack of information. Incoherant and lame.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The only conspiracy here is the one that's ripping you off if you buy this ""book"". A totally unfocused, unreadable compendium of crap. I wouldn't even try to resell my copy to a used book store. Painfully bad and a waste of time."
2,IT LACKS OF EXACT DATA,"Interesting book if you are not an expert in sects, or esoteric groups. But if you have some time researching about them,......then you will find a lot of mistakes, names, dates, .....If you are looking for a fiction book, buy it! but if you want to be well informed, dont wawste your time with it."
2,Plot to forcibly remove FDR from White House not mentioned,"I searched in vain to find any reference the 1932 (or 1933) plan by U.S businessmen to supplant FDR with a Mussolini-type fascist government. In ""The Plot to Seize the White House,"" Jules Archer documents this conspiracy (investigated by the McCormack-Dickstein Congressional committee) in great detail. This is an absolutely astounding omission. The book, to my mind, is seriously flawed since this disquieting episode of American history does not seem to have been included."
5,THE essential BWCA guidebook!,"This is the only comprehensive guidebook to many of the lakes and portage trails in the Boundry Waters Canoe Area. It is published in two volumes that concentrate on the eastern and western sides of this wilderness area. Each volume comes with a good map that covers the areas mentioned in the book that will assist you when you go to purchase specific maps for the area you are going to travel. It lists sites to see while paddling, good places to camp and those to avoid and describes portages in rods and detail. A must have title for true paddlers or armchair dreamers!"
1,Lots of mistakes in software and book itself,I would not recommend buying the bookthere is tons of mistakes in actual text and the software is extremely buggy.horrible waste of $66 dollars!
4,good book but find the CD more useful,I just started using the book. It is a bit confusing since refers to some audios that I don't find in the Cd. Maybe I just need more time to get to know it better.
5,I GASPED!,"First at the price, I mean, come on---$100 for a SMALL jar of eye cream? SO I tried a sample at the store (put it under one eye) and started walking around the mall. A friend of mine came up to me and asked how I'd gotten my black eye. I thought the cream had caused my mascara to run and went to look in the mirror. NO! The eye I put the cream under was fine! Tight, no dark circles, refreshed looking. The difference in dark circles was so great that the guy thought my OTHER eye was bruised in comparison. I have been using it for one week now and I'm a devotee for life!"
2,Review Christian Ethics,It was a rather mundane review of Christian Ethics that went over a lot of already covered material. It did not focus on any creative pieces to help me with providing leadership in this area.
2,Weak,"I bought this album without previewing it first and with little background on the project. Personally, I was disappointed. The cliches may have been more appropriate a decade ago, but this album seems dated and contrived. I stopped listening after ""Young Black and Just Don't Give a...."" and I don't know if I'll ever finish it. I'm still going to see them in concert when they come to my city but I hope they stick to their other, much better material. I could see how it could appeal to some, however, so I gave it two stars."
4,UKe Shirt,"The fabric is nice and the workmanship is good, but the cut is a little smaller than most Hawaiian type shirts. Hawaiian shirts are usually very full cut and fit loose, but this one is made more like a dress shirt."
5,great product for price !,"heavy duty construction ,very simple to put in, two screws i used my own 3 inch deck screws not the ones supplied with product, very simple to set your own combination,does not come preprogramed., does not matter what order you put your combination in as long as you hit all the numbers,1-9 digit pass code, i happen to use a 4 digit suggest you using a 3-4 digit., im happy with it, now all i have to do is get a key cut for it ."
4,Key Safe,"The product works as advertised and appears to be well designed. However, my wife has a struggle getting it to open properly."
4,psyclone rangers 2nd album (1994),"this album was produced by Ian caple (tindersticks,jesus and mary chain) and was warmly recieved by critics when it was released but never really made much of a dent which is a shame when you have people like the great Patti smith and Lenny kaye wanting to be on stadge with you! a real talent the songs remind me of mc5 with that same energy its quiet punky check out the cover of creedence clearwater revival oh yes more please!"
4,"Excellent read, with some interesting novel ideas.","An excellent series, this the first of three books, I look forward to the fourth! Maybe not totally new in some of the plot - but how many books nowadays are? But, it contains enough new ideas, strong well written characters, and adventure to make it a good read. It has just enough mystery in it - with the aliens - to leave one questioning, even after having read the book. I enjoy a book that is thrilling but makes me think and wonder at the end. When is the #4 in the series coming out?"
4,XBOX Nascar Wheel,I really like this wheel. very responsive. I thought it would work on all driving games but even with sensitivity turned all the way down some games are just to sensivitive and are better played with the hand set. My old wheel had leg clamps that fit around your legs to hold wheel if you play in a chair like i do. Sometimes it is hard to hold wheel in your lap.
5,Indy film making at its best!,This is one of those rare films that is filled with nostalgia and adventure but is also hilarious! I saw it at a film festival in NY and then again in Los Angeles and I have to say it is extraordinary.
5,1993 Remix,Recording contents:LP Version * 3:30Tony King's Hip Hop Mix * 5:30Jewels & Stone Club Mix * 6:20Jumpin' Johnny Joy's R&B; Mix * 5:22PWL's Original Mix * 5:55
4,good upbeat Latin music!,"I listen to a lot of musica latina, from Cuban to Mexican and so on. While this is has more of a ""commercial"" sound to it, as opposed to say the Buena Vista Social Club tradtional sound, it is intended to be such. It is more dance music, a merengue type sound.I like it a lot because it is very upbeat and has good musical performances, and Jessica has a good voice for this type of music."
5,PASIONAL,"Estuve mucho tiempo esperando un nuevo CD de Jessica Cristina y cuando salio a la venta -Pasional- no dude en comprarlo. Comprar un CD de Jessica Cristina es algo seguro, sabes que sera de calidad y ni hablar de lo maravillosa que es su voz. -El Jardin Prometido- es el tema mas caliente del CD, es un merengue bien diferente a lo que Jessica ha hecho antes. La balada -Nunca Supe Mas De Ti- estaba #1 en la radio la ultima vez que estuve en Miami. El CD contiene merengues, baladas y pop rock. Una produccion muy completa. Jessica Cristina y Melina Leon son mis merengueras favoritas. Estare esperando su proximo CD."
5,A refreshing novel reflecting traditional values,"A great book to lose yourself in, and soak up the way life used to be; and still is for some of us. Don't miss this book!"
2,Time Machine to Straighten Out Your Parents!,"This movie has an unbelievable story which is also quite ridiculous. The son is allergic to marriage because his parents are constantly quarrelling. The parents are Aishwarya Rai and Akshay Kumar, the main role players.Enter Randhir Kapoor, the Professor. He has built a flying machine which has broken the ""sound barrier"" and which will enable time travel. The son is dating his daughter. He decides to time travel back to straighten out his parents before they got married. What follows is an endless series of silly and ridiculous episodes as the son goes about establishing male dominance for his father.All's well that ends well. The movie has one popular song. Neither Akshay Kumar and Aishwarya Rai nor Om Puri and Kirron Kher, who are otherwise good actors, could enliven such a dead story. This movie is definitely avoidable."
4,The original,"This is an excellent book. This was the original self-hypnosis, self-suggestion book from which so many take their ""original"" thought. I have been practicing this myself. My only dislike is that a good portion of the book is simply case history/examples."
1,poor printing quality,The printing quality is very poor. It actually makes it difficult to read. It looks like a sixth generation photocopy of the original book. Do not purchase this version.
1,Wrong Format for CD,This product was billed as a CD. The first copy was in an MP-3 format and would not play on any regular CD player. The replacement copy still was in an unknown format and would not play.
4,Nice,"fits well, light, good price, seals very well. Still get s a little fog but I guess that's normal. Recommended."
1,What happened to a quality product?,"I have used this product for several years with good results. In the past year, the quality of the goggles has decreased to the point to which they are unreliable. The goggles leak and won't seal. When a person is in a mile swim part of a triathlon, she shouldn't have to worry about leaking goggles. The company hasn't responded to any emails. I'm looking for a new type of goggles to use."
4,comfortable,Every so often it leaks after several laps and water starts sipping in. Most of the time it seals well. I have not been able to identify why it leaks at times.I like that the mark it leaves is much less noticeable than with other goggles and it fades faster.Overall it feels very comfortable
1,Not for me,The extra width of the googles came down to far on my nose and caused my nose piece to fall off. Did not seal to keep out water. I hated them.
3,Swim goggles,"Unfortunately, this is a difficult product for me to rate because i have had a very difficult time finding goggles that actually fit my head. i seem to get best results from children's sizes. These are a great product generally, but these were too big for me."
4,Love them,"The goggles fit snugly, don't leak, are comfortable, and the visibility is great. They do, however, leave quite a deep mark around the entire edge of the seal."
4,Better than goggles for me.,"I purchased the Aqua Sphere Seal XP Lady Swim mask because goggles don't fit me well. I tried many different goggles, but they all leaked or had to be so tight that I'd have marks half the day. After using these for a couple of weeks, I can say I am pleased. I haven't had any leak issues, there are no marks on my face after an hour swim, and my vision range is excellent. While I wouldn't want them for pool racing (too bulky), they are fantastic for open water swims and pool workouts. These are definitely staying in my swim bag!"
2,"Not for large heads and noses, that's for sure","These goggles left deep marks in my forehead and cheeks, did not quite seal around my nose (been told I have a Roman nose, and my hat size is large), and maybe because the seal was bad they even fogged up! MAYBE someone with a smaller head and face would have more success...*Instead I would recommend the same company's Aqua Sphere Vista Lady Swim MaskAqua Sphere Vista Lady Swim Maskand/or the Aqua Sphere Vista Swim MaskAqua Sphere Vista Swim Mask. They fit similar and have way more soft silicone-like plastic around the edges which seals gently but AIR TIGHT. I have a pair of each now (the ladies version doesn't come with a dark lens for outside) and they never fog, never leak, leave minimal marks on my face (main reason I purchased them), and fit both my husband and I perfectly. And the vision through them is SO CLEAR it's unbelievable. I believe they're made in Italy."
2,Didn't fit well.,"Bought this product because prolonged use of standard goggles were making rings around my eyes & under eye area puffy & dark. Thought going to a larger mask-type goggle would reduce that problem. However, the fit was not very good with these goggles, over the nose area in particular. The strap had to be so tight to prevent leaking, that I've just gone back to standard goggles."
1,Leaking already...,"I am very upset with this swim mask. My prior one lasted one year before leaking. This one lasted 12 swims and now leaks immediately upon entering the water. I find the small goggles tortuous and now read that for swimmers ""of a certain age"", they can cause permanent damage to the tender, thin undereye skin. Now what for women with narrow faces? Of course, I want to send the mask back but it is too late. I hardly used the mask the first month or two that I had it because I was swimming indoors (it's Florida but the heated outdoor pools are too cold for me!). I feel cheated! I would give the mask no stars had I that option."
4,nice goggles,These goggles are so much better than those teeny eye goggles. I can see so much more and great smoky lens for bright outdoors sun. They do fog up and you need to use anti fog spray of some kind.
4,Love the tint!,I ordered these tinted goggles because my local indoor pool has a sliding roof and gets really sunny in the summer. I am now at an age when regular goggles cause issues with the skin around my eyes. These larger goggles fit better without the under eye issues. The tinted lenses are real bonus. They do leak a tad sometimes hence the 4 stars. Overall they are great.
2,Not the same quality,"I purchased these briefs based on past experiences. Based on reviews I had read, I ordered one size smaller than I normally would have. It likely helped some, but still not happy with product. I will not buy this brand again. It's to bad they chose to alter the quality of what was a very good brief."
2,Quality? What Quality?,Years ago these were the best briefs you could buy. I ordered several packs. So far I have thrown away about one third of the briefs. Some fit perfectly. The ones I have thrown out have had the following problems. About three had the elastic in the leg section so tight I could hardly get them on. Four had the elastic stretch out within minutes like I was wearing bloomers. A couple seemed to be a smaller size than the rest.Apparently these are made without attention to consistent quality. Needless to say I won't be purchasing these again. I guess I'll have to go back to buying Fruit of the Loom. I don't throw as many of those out and they are much cheaper. If anyone knows of a good pouch brief out there please let me know.
1,Munsingwear Briefs,I bought these for my husband and the quality is very poor. Not all the seams were sewn. After the first wash they are already coming apart. Would not recommend this product.
1,Too Loose,"I ordered these when the Jockey version became unavailable (thank goodness, I have since found the Jockeys). I suppose that if you wear boxer shorts, you might find these comfortable, because the leg openings on the pair I received were vastly over-sized. This is despite the fact that I ordered a waist size one below the size of my trousers. Very disappointing."
2,QUALITY HAS DEGRADED,"I'VE BEEN BUYING MUNSINGWEAR POUCH BRIEFS FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THEM. THIS LATEST PURCHASE IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME. THE BAND AROUND THE LEGS IS LOOSE WHERE IT USED TO BE SNUG. I DON'T LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS EVERYTHING TO HANG OURSIDE THE BRIEFS RATHER THAN BEING CONTAINED. I ALSO NOTICED THAT THESE WERE MADE IN INDIA WHICH MY BE THE REASON FOR THE LOOSE FITTING. THE LEG BANDS SHOULD BE CONSISTANT WITH THE WAIST BAND SIZE, BUT IT'S NOT. TAKE A LOOK AT THE IMAGE DISPLAYED. THEY DON'T FIT LIKE IT SHOWS. I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN OR EXCHANGE THEM BUT DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD GET THE SAME RESULTS. :(I have returned these briefs and will no longer purchase them. Now worth the price."
2,Bloomers,"This product falls way too big........more like ""bloomers"" for old men......although I am big (42), these would have fit a size ""50"", imo, I had the whole family laughing about these.....I did not return them, but I will not re-order either.....lolin addition, the delivery caused me aggravation.......using the tracking #, i rec'd a notice that the prouct was delivered on 2/16, it wasn't.......after complaining, they arrived about 5 days later..."
2,Degraded quality,"I'm a happy user of Munsingwear for 15 years now but was shocked to notice on my recent purchase that the stitches were coming off and the sizes are not standard (too big for a medium 32"" compared to my old ones). Some stitches already broke even before I started using them. This is ridiculous Munsingwear - wake up!"
1,terrible quality,"I read the reviews an many brands, saw that recent reviews were not kind to this product but decided to give it a try based on older good reviews. Trust the new reviews. These underwear have started to come apart after just 5 washings. Many reviews have said that the quality of these briefs has declined now that manufacturing has moved away from our shores. I don't know what these briefs were like when made here but they sure stink now. Don't waste your money! I got Dockers brifs too and love them."
1,this product not what it used to be,I bought this product for the first time two years ago and they were great. I re-ordered recently and was very disappointed. I never review products. If they are bad I just suck it up. But just had to say how bad this product had become. Shorts are very oversized. Fit as if they were four years old. I will not buy again.
2,Weird fit,"I used to buy Munsingwear underwear in the past and was always happy with them but switched to Jockey because I couldn't find Munsingwear in department stores anymore. When I found this brand on Amazon I decided to try them again and have to say that I'm not very happy with them. Maybe it's just my body but the fit is really weird. They are too baggy in the front and the leg openings in the back are cut too high. The result is an ""insecure"" feeling that is very noticeable throughout the day. Even though they're only about a month old I'm ordering Jockeys today to replace them."
5,Good Underwear,"I'm not an experienced fashion critic, so this underwear review will be BRIEF (get it?):This is good underwear. Buy with confidence. Thank you."
5,dad's munsingwear,Ordering was a breeze. Product arrived at the time promised and in excellent condition.
3,Musingwear men's briefs,"The items received did not match Munsingwear men's briefs that I've owned previously, so I sent a e-mail to the vendor, Essential Apparel, asking to exchange the items received for a similar type that would fit properly and be comfortable. That was on December 12th, and to date there has been no response. I have purchased numerous items from Amazon.com in the past and this is the first time I have been dissatisfied trying to exchange an item because the seller would not responsd. I will not buy anything from this Amazon associate again."
3,Why do they have to change things?,"My husband has worn this brand of underwear for years and has been happy with them. Something now has changed. It seems that the material and elastic are thinner. They still are better than non pouch brands from off the shelf, but he is disappointed in the decline of quality."
1,"Should be advertised as ""factory seconds""","Bought 3 packs. First and only pack opened:Had variance of two inches in waistbands.Had unsymmetric stitching of ""pouch;"" closer to leg-hole on one side.Seam down center of ""pouch"" added NO EXTRA FABRIC, thus IS NOT A POUCH.I wear pouch-style briefs to insure cotton between jewels and legs.Was distracted all day yesterday by lack thereof.The eight unworn items will go to our church for various programs.I will meekly return to Jockeys where I get what I pay for.Gustwillers delivered promptly and I have no problem with them, unless I find these were actually factory seconds and not advertised as such."
5,Good value,I purchased the Munsingwear kangaroo briefs because I could not find them at any of my local stores. I have worn these breifs for years and was pleased to find them on Amazon. They were delivered to me promptly and I am pleased with the whole process.
3,Full-Rise?,I didn't realize what the full rise was until I put them on. The full rise must mean they are taller than standard. The ones I'm used to are about 1-2 inches less in height. They should have a selection to select standard or full rise.
5,Not 3 pack,I love the underwear. I have worn them for 50 years. But you do not get a 3 pack you get a 2 pack.
3,Okay but not up to Jockeys yet,The material and stiching are very nice. There are two issues I have they ride very high and the tag need to be removed or it itchs. Why they insist on tags I will never know.
3,Quality,"I have worn this brand for years, but this last order appears to be somewhat different. The material and waist band seem to be thinner and subsequently they seem to be somewhat loose, more baggy and provide less support."
3,pouch,I made a mistake in ordering these. They are too high in the waist and I think designed for a more rotund figure. I am skinny and I feel like I have these tucked up under my armpits like and old geezers pants.My mistake - I should have ordered the smaller cut ones.
4,Munsingwear Men's 3-Pack Full-Rise Pouch,This is the only place to purchase hard to find Munsingwear briefs. More comfortable than the other kangaroo-type pouch briefs. Maybe a bit more expensive but they last longer.
4,Just to let you know..,"This is not the same Jet that just came out with ""Get Born."" That's right, this is a completely different band from the 70s.To the person who wrote that other review.. Yes, it does not have the same magic as ""Get Born"" because this is a different band. Sorry, just seemed like that needed to be cleared up."
3,Ok but not what I expected,"This cd is ok but don't expect it to be the other JET ""Get born"". This isn't the same kind of magic. ""Get born"" is down to earth, true Rock and Roll, old style. THIS IS NOT.This bands website is still a geocities website. Come on guys! Website's aren't that expensive. Make sure you check out their music at a local CD/Record store before you buy since you can't sample it here like most cd's."
5,Instant relief,My daughters back went out on her and after a day of trying to work it out we went to the emergency room. They did nothing but ask questions then send her home. She was in so much pain she couldn't walk or sit. We bought the super Flex Back Formula pills and within an hour she was almost standing straight and by that evening she was doing great. We keep these on hand and when she feels her back going out she starts taking them and she gets better. The same thing happened to a friend of hers and as soon as she took them she was able to walk again without pain. It may not work for all but for us and the ones we have recommended it to it has worked wonders!
3,Fast-paced thriller is a good fun read,"This novel is more adventure thriller with DNA involved than science fiction, and it has the unlikely hero of a nineteen year old Nobel Prize winner (it's not his brilliance I question, it's the way the Nobel prizewinners get nominated. Newcomers need not apply. You need a track record.) But be that as it may, Peter Rhoades, boy genius, gets the opportunity to head up a biotech genetics firm. The firm gets contracts and grants and has an impressive list of achievments for a decade and a half.Then a mysterious ""agency"" demands that Rhoade's firm hand over a research project. Is it ""national interest"", is this truly a sanctioned agency or are nefarious forces at work? When people start getting hurt, the action speeds up and this thriller picks up the pace.If you like exciting novels that read like adventure-suspense films, Mendel's child is a good choice. It's good casual reading for your summer beachbag or for a couple of rainy, boring winter afternoons."
3,Not much geology,"""Geologists I admire"" might be a better title. There is an awful lot more scattershot history of the exploration of the GC than there is explanation of geology. Plus it skimps on maps, diagrams, photos, drawings."
4,Ordinary Magic,"I learned more in the first thirty pages of this book than I have in ten years of attending workshops and classes. Sunday's book is about true magic, the magic that permeates ordinary reality and in fact, is, ordinary reality. If you want to learn how to live a magical life, just read this book. The space between the words vibrates with power, love and wisdom. What a ride!"
3,A Rousing Adventure,"I found the main plot line and the characters in Larson's book to be all engrossing -- A rousing adventure. I found the ""out of body sequences"" -- dreams, visions and so forth -- diverting, wanting to get on with the story. As a man this book gave me a new dimension and a broader perspective of the mind and spirit of women."
5,Great personalized book!,"My kids, 5 and 7, love this book! It has a story personalized with the kid of honor and up to 2 friends' names! I would recommend this to a friend with kids up to 8 yrs old."
3,Ho Hum,"I am a fan of many of the contributors in this book. Erwin especially. Some of the others leave a bit more to be desired. This book is a bit hard to follow because it is like reading a discussion. Discussions are fine, in person. When you have to read discussion, it can be a bit challenging. This book puts forth some decent ideas and you can glean some wisdom from it, but it is not going to set the world on fire. Not every book does. JVD"
3,"Good Ideas, Bad Graphics","Many valuable suggestions, thought-provoking discussion of howthe church can be what it really is, rather than following one-size fits all ideas. I'd rate it higher but for the graphic design, which makes much of it almost impossible to read. Light grey print on grey pages, and similar phenomena aren't good for reading in general, especially for those of us whose eyesight isn't good. Not only the church, but its books need to be diability-friendly."
