2,alot of money for a flimsy product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BEWARE!!!,i was VERY DISSAPOINTED with the durability factor in this product. it was easy to assemble and looked good. but the crane broke within a month. very awkward to use anyway. my 3 year old son was too young so i had stored in basement. now too late to get a replacement part. they want over 30 dollars plus 10 dollars shipping to relace the crane!!! what a rip. now my son will be using this as just a sandbox LOL the place where the crane fits into is now turned into a seat for my son. the lid IS good to move trucks up and down and is cool to push against sandbox so trucks have a bigger area to move. too much money for this product. the blue dumping bucket is a fun feature on this product though. i put water in and he can dump or wash his trucks with it.
5,Beloved sandbox for wee construction workers,"Every child who comes over, boy or girl, is mad for this sandbox. My two sons, 3 and 1, play in it every day -- they love it. It's as educational as you make it or as your children want: I believe the crane (included) is great for coordination, plus if just for the imagination a child uses when playing in the sand then a sandbox is definitely educational! We live in an area with afternoon thunderstorms and thus far we've had no problems with any leaking from the lid .... The other reviews were helpful in that yes, the lid isn't sturdy enough to support me (a grown female), but it is fine for my children and their trucks. We'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
1,waste of money and unsafe,"I was very shocked with my disappointment in this toy coming from Little Tikes. The bucket did crack as stated in previous reviews, although Little Tikes supposedly fixed this and made it stronger. My problem is that it is so difficult to use that when kids try to rotate the crane they whack each other in the head with it! It's not only poorly designed, but unsafe. If you use it, wear a hard hat!"
2,worst little tike toy ever,this is the most poorly made little tikes toy i have ever seen. the lid doesn't seel so it fills with water the crane doesn't work correctly so it is very frustrating to use it is made out of very thin plastic
1,Construction sand box is no good!,"The construction sand box has a design flaw by the dump bucket. Even with the lid on the box, pushed down tightly, there is no way to keep rain water out of the box. I have had to replace the sand several times because when it would rain there would be alot of standing water, which in turn would mold the sand. Also my son which is 3 cannot operate the excavator arm and gets aggrivated. Most importantly for the price of the sand box you should not have to worry about water and lizzards and spiders and rollie pollies and ants(you get the picture)getting into it, it should seal shut!"
1,Disappointed!,The lid is very flimsy! It can barely hold a truck full of sand. The crane is hard to use because it gets sand in the mechanism. It is overpriced.
4,WARNING! Not worth the price,"We received this as a gift for my son's 1st birthday. He played in it one day. After that, it always had inches of water in it. The lid is useless. We even covered the entire box with a large tarp and still had leaks. Little Tikes offered some fixes but in the end they replaced it with equal value of other toys. I cannot believe that its still on the market."
1,Pick a different sandbox.,I had always bought my son LT toys and had always been pleased BUT this one was a BIG let down especially for the price. Even with the lid on rain water was still able to get inside. So everytime it would rain we would have to go out and buy more bags of sand because the sand would get ruined. We got this for my son when he was 4 and was never able to use the digger. My husband and I even had a difficult time using it. Eventually with little use the handle that controlled the digger broke off. Great!! This sandbox should have been recalled for many many reasons. So my advice buy a different sandbox!!!!
1,Construction Sand Box,We have the new construction sand box and it has been a huge disappointment. My boys ages 6 & 7 are not strong enough to operate the digger arm. The digger arm is poorly designed and extremelt difficult to assemble. It is in the way and takes up space and does not work properly.The idea is great the actual product is a big disapointment. Save your money and pick a different product.
2,Not made like they used to...,"Gee, I guess we should have just kept the Little Tikes Turtle Sandbox! At least rain water didn't leak into it! Little Tikes says the cover lid is ""only to keep leaves out"". I guess if the designers would have constructed the bucket area to keep water out instead of Little Tikes telling the customer to drill drain holes into the sandbox and fashion their own gasket to keep the water out, the sandbox would have been a better toy. If you get this and plan to put it outside (where a sandbox is supposed to be), you'd better 1) have tools to modify it 2) buy a vinyl cover 3) Buy sand all the time because the wet sand from rain water really smells and is unsanitary 4) Pray it never rains where you live."
1,Welcome mat for germs,I agree with all the people who have given this sandbox a poor review. I have tried everything to get it to NOT collect water and it doesn't work. I have also owned the turtle sandbox as well and both of them collect water and things grow in there that I can not identify. Dont waste your money. You will be so disappointed. If anyone should ever find a worthwile sandbox please share! Kids love to play in sandboxes and mind did too. Unfortunately they spent more time crying because I wouldnt let them inside the swamp than they did playing in it. If you live in a nice dry climate then you are lucky yours might have a longer life. If you live in an area where you can expect rain often then forget about it!
1,not worth the money,"what a disapointment. The sandbox is missing pieces, which now are on backorder. Holes not predrilled. After two weeks the sandbox sits unfinished. toy r us blames little tikes, little tikes blames toys r us. We sit here with an unfinished product and out a large amount of money. I would love to return this sandbox but I put the sand in already. My 3yr old is very disapointed. Our advice to you is to save your money. This sandbox is not worth it."
4,Construction Sandbox,"This sandbox is great when the kids can play in it. If you do purchase this one, be prepared to put new sand in it every time it rains. Ours is always wet and gets moldy as well."
2,Poorly designed sandbox,"We were very excited to buy this sandbox for our son over a year ago. Unfortunately we spend all of our time getting water out and other debris that gets into it. My son has enjoyed the sandbox when it is cleaned up and uses the digger and dumper well on it. My main complaint is that the lid does not fit very well. I emailed the company and they told me to drill two holes under the blue bucket to allow water to drain and not go into the sandbox. We have tried this and it still does not do a very good job. It is very misleading to have a lid on it like many other sandboxes, yet it is useless. We have finally talked our son into giving it up for another plain one, just to keep it clean and dry. I am disappointed that the company has not redesigned this sandbox to make it a joy to have instead of a nightmare."
2,Starting falling apart immediately,The crane broke off in the first week of use. The blue scoop part comes out easily and all the sand starts falling out because the blue scoop is part of the wall. The lid that is supposed to convert into part of the fun cannot hold up a toy truck and espcially not a child - it just collapses. I was really disappointed in Little Tikes with this product.
1,VERY Disappointed,"I bought this last summer for my two young grandsons, 18 months and 3 who live in North Carolina and generally have more sun than rain. One rain and the sand was a swamp mixed with outside dirt and leaves. It was dumped and refilled and a few weeks later another rain swamped it again. It sits on the high side of the yard and under a tree. The lid is fairly useless and quite flimsy for any trucks to be driven on it and the crane is much too stiff for the 3-year-old to use so both boys are quite frustrated with this expensive toy. I waited to see if the interest in this sandbox would pick up but they have given up on it. Plus we threw away the sandbox they had. Save your money. Buy a better made sandbox and IF you want them to have a sit on crane buy one of the $45-$55 ones- They are 1/4 of the cost, easier to use, and last much longer.Save your money,Save your money, Save you money.We buy our grandsons many expensive toys - this is one to take a pass on."
5,Great sandbox!,"My son loves this sandbox. I would agree that it is somewhat flimsy, but what do you expect from a piece of plastic. If you want something durable, buy a wood one. I have had no problems with the crane. I have just one bit of advice...make sure you read the directions and put the crane on before you put sand it it. Also, the lid, which Little Tikes indicates doubles as a ""road,"" is very lightweight and cannot support much weight beyond 5 pounds."
2,disappointing,"Fills with water and its a battle to keep sand from being moldy or algae covered. I drilled holes in the bottom and top edge of the base which have helped.Also, the digger broke and have not been able to get part from Little Tikes.Very disappointed. At this price I expected better."
1,No Fun Sandbox,"I work at a preschool and the administration bought us this sandbox for the playground. We had two teachers directly supervising the children and the sandbox broke within an hour's time! First, pieces of the claw broke off, then the plastic part that moves the claw broke. The children were so disappointed!"
2,David Lindley,Classic David Lindley. I am forever grateful to the friend who played some of this man's music for me 4 years ago. I have seen David Lindley live on 3 occasions and have never been disappointed.There aren't many CDs out there that I would say are perfect. There are certainly some wonderful examples of Mr. Lindley's genius represented on Twango Bango III.This purchase leaves me with no regrets.
1,ungly!,this doll looks like a monster when i first bought her.I tell you she looks worst than a wolfman barbie look than her.she ungly don't buy her.buy her or you will have nightmares about her unglyness.
5,Don't let this song end!!!,"If you like dance music, Gloria's single ""don't let this moment end"" takes it a step further. With the fusion of dance, techno and pop, plus meaningful and great lyrics, this is on of the best singles of the album ""gloria!"""
5,Blown Away!,"Although I've always liked and respected Gloria Estefan for her talent and inspirational courage in the face of personal trauma, I never really took her seriously as a superior dance artist...until now. ""Don't Let This Moment End"" is the type of peak hour anthem that packs the dance floor like sardines...an across the board smash that combines just the right amount of hard rhythm with Gloria's smooth, mesmerizing vocals. This is one of her best pop/dance songs in years...1000 times better than her remake of ""Turn the Beat Around"". Buy this song...one listen and you won't want to let the moment end either."
3,this is for a Christmas gift,I really can't write a review because this is for a Christmas gift for husband & hasn't been opened yet. I can give a better review after Christmas.
3,sacred,I enjoyed most of the music. My main complaint is the repeated songs from John McDermott's Faithfullness CD. For us fans of John the repeats seem a bit too much. I think there are six reteats.
3,"Okay, but . . .","I was not overly impressed with this CD. I felt some of the songs were overwrought and had too much orchestra on them. The best ones were the songs where the focus was on the singers, and not the accompaniment. And I'm really ticked off about Lord of the Dance--they left off the last verse, which I think is the best one in the whole song. I bought this mainly for Be Thou My Vision, Lord of the Dance, Amazing Grace, and Morning has Broken. I just wish the rest of the songs were as good. I would recommend John McDermott's ""Great is Thy Faithfullness"" over this CD."
4,read this and then rent a 'Blad,A great way to learn about medium format photographyis to read this book and then rent a Hasselblad for a weekend.
1,Poor quality,"Bought two of these cables and they worked ok for a few months, afterwards they worked poorly or not at all. The female end did not hold the connection tightly either."
1,Garbage,"I bought 3 of these cables, tried them on 3 different PCs running Windows XP Pro SP2, and 3 different peripherals. None of them worked. The best I got was half a page of garbled text from my printer. Don't bother with these."
3,"strange size, good sweater","Bought it to make a present, now it appears I will wear it myself,no customer's remorse! I wear size 6, this ""Large"" sweater is just a little bit roomy for me in the shoulders, but I wouldn't like it to be smaller in the rubber knit below the waiste, though I wear bottoms 4-6(8 for Cambio jeans)Nice casual sweater, not the ultimate quality, but perfect for casual activities, actually for any activities.I got 2 -lavender and camel, so now I just have 2 more cashmere sweaters,though forgot to mention - I'm cashmere addict! :)"
1,sweater,I returned the sweater to Unrealfind (the company I purchased the sweater from) for a refund on Dec 31st as it was to small and poor quailty.I have delayed repoting this to you untill I got my January credit card statment which did not show any credit. Any help you can give would be appreciated. Thanks Pat Lee.
2,Brubeck in a Symphonic setting,"I have reviewed most all of Dave Brubeck's work since the 1950's and this is probably one of the most tame of his endeavors. I almost went to sleep. I think the general weight of having the London Symphony and also all of the family members at this 80th birthday celebration performance, gets in the way of what Brubeck does best: Straight Ahead Jazz Improvisation on piano. A far better bout in a symphonic setting was done with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic along with the Dave Brubeck quartet in a beautiful blending written and scored by Dave Brubeck's talented Brother, Howard. Sadly, the Bernstein/Brubeck collaboration is not available on recording for some unknown reason - probably licensing permissions I would guess.I would recommend that the listener take the money he/she would invest in this particular CD and invest it in the 'Carnegie Hall' 2 CD set for a clearer hearing of Dave Brubeck doing what he does best."
3,it's okay,the hint book is not as good as i thought it would be. i figure amost of the game by myself. but for beginning gamers it is a good guide
4,Great Book but....,"I think this is a top notch book for any gardener...but...It needs pictures! I am new to Florida and very interested in gardening, I know a lot of the flowers, but not all of them. And as far knowing trees or shrubs I am lost. It is a very descriptive book, with plenty of advice from the authors. Just no pictures! I highly recommend this though for in depth information on plants that will grow."
5,Florid Book of List,"Excellent product and great shipping. This is the best book anyone can own that plans on doing any yard work inflorida. Recommended by Master Gardeners in all of Central Florida, but encompasses all of Florida."
4,Product needs review over long term use,"this product seems effective in use to reduce and eliminate candidai am using this once every other day, alternating with another product which contains L. Spirogenes, the bacteria that inhibits candida.this product seems strong enough and effective enough to be used several times a week rather than every day."
4,Just started taking...,"I just started taking this product but so far it seems to be working. It has cut my appetite back a lot which leads me to believe that those stubborn yeast were increasing my appetite. The pills are a little large and have a strong taste but I just take them with food and I am fine. Today was actually the first day that I felt a little nauseous, but I have been taking for about a week now and today is the first day that I felt nauseous, I think its because you really should cut out all sugar and dairy(I have cut out most but not all)."
1,terrible stomach pain,"I ordered this product because it helped someone else with perioral dermatitis.The day I got it, I took 2 capsules with dinner. I awoke in the middle of the nightwith a terrible pain in my gut. The next day I took one in the am, one in the pm.Same pain all night. I read about the ""die off period"" and tried to stick it out.Even one pill a day would cause problems.I'm not talking about cramps or heart burn.It's hard to explain- almost like a severe burning in the bottom of my stomach.It continued for 10 days so, I discontinued it. Also gave me odd tasting burps. Will probably end up in the trash."
3,Eh.,"I bought this after being on 2 boxes of CandiGONE. I stopped taking the CandiGONE and started with this. Maybe I should have stayed on both, but this didn't seem to do anything for me. I even increased the dose from 4 pills a day to 6. Perhaps my body had gotten so used to the super strength CandiGONE that this wasn't very affective? I'm not sure, but I switched back to CandiGONE and won't be going back."
4,Candida Clear by Now Foods,"It does seem to work. I do feel it helped me even though I having only been taking it a couple of weeks. But the after taste is just awful!! It is best to take it with food, it helps mask the after taste where it't not that bad. But be warned if you take it without food, you won't enjoy the taste in your mouth."
3,Meh,"Tasted okay, can't tell if it worked or not. Took it on an empty stomach once and it made me throw up for 3 hours. When I did some more research I found out that 2 of the ingredients are known for decreasing milk supply and one is absolutely off limits to nursing women. Wish I would have known that before I bought it. I wouldn't recommend it and probably won't be taking it again after my son weans."
2,Just didn't work for me.,"Took this product for a full month. It didn't help me to maintain the levels of candida that I was able to with other products. I hate paying for Candex, but it's the better product."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,I HAVE SYSTEMIC CANDIDASIS... I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND WITH THIS PRODUCT MY SYMPTOMS GOT WORSE!I HAD TO GO BACK TO CANDEX! MORE EXPENSIVE BUT AT LEAST IT WORKS! THOSE WHO CLAIM TO HAVE HAD RESULTS WITH THIS PRODUCT MUST HAVE HAD VERY MILD CASES.IF YOU READ THE INGREDIENTS ... COMPARED TO OTHER PRODUCTS IT REALLY DOES NOT HAVE MUCH IN IT!THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO BE A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!
4,Seems Like It's Worked,"It's hard to know for sure whether these have worked for me or not. I've been eating healthy and exercising. But, I do feel like that has been some good change, and continue to take them until the bottle is empty."
3,"Seems to work, but not as well as other home remedies","I have friends that swear by this stuff and it seems to work fine, but for me it's not as effective at getting rid of my yeast infections as garlic/vinegar tea (2 tablespoons minced garlic in one cup of hot water, add 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and just drink it down quick), plain yogurt (eaten and/or applied topically), and laying off sugar for a few days (sugar grows more yeast). Plus, I'm able to use my usual methods during pregnancy (when a lot of women tend to get YIs), whereas with Candida Clear I can't."
4,Good product...good price... helps to correct the fungus,The Candida Clear is a good product and I recommend itwhomever needs to clear their body of the Candida... and thatis most everyone!!!!
2,No Results,Took this product as directed until bottle was empty and could not see any difference at all. Do Not Recommend this product!
3,Somewhat Basic,"This is a good book for those new to investing or those who feel that they need a more fundamental grounding to their trading activity. If you are a regular reader of multiple business news sources and utilize that information to guide your trading activities, then I would pass on this book."
2,can't really see the difference,"totally agree with one of the reviewers that this book hasn't made valuation any easier, or more accurate, it's good in its review of the various value drivers and competitive forces, but that's nothing new about such review, not to say ground breaking, if this book contains 100 empirical studies of how well the methods it advocates help to pick stocks, then it would deserve to be called a ""treatise"" or ground breaking, but all it has is just one case study (gateway) which does not seem to be particularly illuminating, all in all this book is not bad but just not what it claims to be"
2,does not bring much to the party,"I read this book with great expectations, but it does not add much value. It is a compilation of ideas that are better explored in other books. Rappaport does not bring anything new compared to his previous good book (walk your talk, go back to the blackboard and bring us additional value). Mauboussin pasted some old broker notes sent to clients years ago. Refer to the two excellent books by Copeland on valuation and on real options and you will be safe."
3,Her best collection thus far .,"Because she died at a very young age and most of her work was issued by small, independent labels that came and went, Linda Jones never attained the superstardom she deserved. This CD is her best collection thus far but the digital remastering is only of average quality. Linda's hysterical ,Southern/ Memphis-soul flavored vocal style put her in the same league as Aretha and Gladys."
4,Good three volume set of contemporary blues artists,"A good overall sampling of current artists, also featuring Carl Weathersbys guitar and vocals. carlweathersby.org"
4,Bindo chips,I was disappointed that I only recieved three colors in the bag. I needed to have all the colors for a project.
3,work ok,THey work well for bigger groups so you have extra pieces in bingo.Only down side was they were later getting here than expected.
1,not happy!,The item I received is not the one pictured in fact they are not the same colors and are not packaged in this way. They seem to have been counted out and placed in small ziploc bags perhaps from a larger amount??? Not happy at all!!!
2,NOT AS SEEN IN THE PICTURE,"Chips came in plain plastic bags, and only 2 different colors. They are decent size, perfect to use with the jumbo size Mexican bingo."
2,"Not ""Multi-colored""",Please read these reviews before you purchase this! I see I'm not the only one who ordered this product thinking it was multi-colored.
3,Families of Russia,"A story about 2 families in Russia as told by the children themselves. Ideal for anyone wanting to know what typical family life is like in Russia, Good general interest item to watch in a classroom situation."
5,American Tabloid Best Record of the Year,"Kid Million have created a beautiful record with American Tabloid. The social commentary is intelligent and accurate, and the music rocks. I love ""A Terrible Noise"" and ""Flew By"", but all of the songs are great. An amazing record from one of the best bands around."
3,"OK book, small and handy, might be good for off-the-beaten tracks in France.",Bought this just before going to Paris for a holiday. Did not use it - as Parisians are really nice and were better at understanding English then we are at French. If I had to buy a phrase book again would buy one with better organization and presentation like the ones from Dorling Kindersley.
4,Nifty tidbits,"I hardly ever wrap gifts, so it's difficult for me to evaluate the book in this regard. Based on riffling through the pages, there's a nice variety of wrapping methods with clear instructions (including step-by-step line illustrations) and color photographs of the finished results. In addition to paper-wrapping methods, the book also shows several decorative ways of tying mizuhiki/ribbons.So why did I buy the book? From a historical/origami perspective, it has a lot of fascinating information. Several of the wrapping methods are based on traditional mizuhiki knots and paper folds that were originally used to wrap/store things like kimono, tea-ceremony utensils, natto, and religious offerings. There's also a brief chapter about furoshiki at the end.Since I haven't tried to put most of the directions into practice yet, I can't fully evaluate the book's usefulness or I would've given it perfect marks. But to the extent that I'm familiar with its contents to far, it's pretty cool ^_^"
5,Very usefull book,"It is fantastic! I loved this book. I has pages whith colored photos of all the desings. The autor is precise (acurate)in the measures and diagrams, important for learning the new ideas proposed. It is very crreative and usefull.(I'm sorry about my english...i don't write it very well, it's not my language. Anyway i think that you will understand my message)."
3,This is book is OK.,"I expected more ideas on how to wrap beautiful presents from this book, but was only moderately satisfied from its content. This is certainly one of the better books out there on amazon.com about beautiful gift wrapping. However, I have seen many more beautiful ideas on how to wrap gifts in Asia. If only there was a book that described and taught more ideas on gift-wrapping."
3,nice and useful,"This book is nice and useful.The folding instructions and matching photo's are very clear.The ideas in the book are original (at least they seem so to me).I voted 3 stars, 'cause it's not really my style. I've warmed up better for other gift wrapping books."
5,Great!,"This book is a concise - and at the same time detailed hands-on guide to create gift packaging and wrappings.The book includes around 60 different ways to wrap up stuff, all based on traditional methods used in Japans. Plenty of pics and diagrams - you can choose the wrapping starting from the shape of what you need to package, including odd objects like bottles, candies and balls.I am pretty pathetical at wrapping gifts, but I was able to create a nice looking package in a matter of minutes. If you are interested in creating striking wrappings for your gifts or goods, give the book a try, it's really very well done, practical and useful."
5,Gloria Estefan.. THE BEST !!,"I'm a super fan of Gloria Estefan, this CD it's just great, the single is one of my favorites from the Gloria! Album."
2,More frustrating than funny,"Firstly, the cover has nothing really to do with the book (not the author's fault), but if you're looking for a hunky labourer type, this is not the book for you.Next: someone else mentioned making the leap of disbelief, but that was just too much for me. The characters, especially the hero, did things I didn't understand and junped to too many conclusions. I didn't understand why the hero was so desperate to prove the heroine was lying about being married, yet *didn't* ask himself why she was doing it. Probably because he would have come up with the answer pretty quickly. The heroine was too passive for me to really care about what happened to her.Unfortunately for me as a reader, I didn't find a ""vibrant new voice"" with this book."
3,Kind of stupid...,"This book was entertaining but not very good. Delaney, the leading female character, reacted in such illogical ways and the leading man, Jack, never got mad when he should have. It made it so that I couldn't respect her and he came out looking like a pushover."
4,great beginner bass dvd,Although this is a very good dvd for beginners on the bass. I think more information on tuning and examples of the different scales would have be nice to see but the extras including the online support make it a great resourse for those starting out.
3,Updated version available under a different name.,"This is a good book, but it's been obsoleted by a newer version that uses the UML instead of the non-standard notation in this book. The new book is ""Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Design in UML""."
2,Boring,"This toy was a bummer, we had actually bought it thinking we could use Hot Wheels cars on it too. But you cant. Only the two cars that come with it fit and go."
3,My Review of the Toddlerz Spiral Speedway,We purchased this product for one of our son's Christmas gifts.Pros:Well built and durableMakes racing soundsEasy to use (1+)Cons:Kids get bored with it quicklySounds go off my themselves sometimes and can be annoyingOdd shape makes it difficult to put away in a toybox
3,This is a good $10 toy,"I am shocked to see this toy being sold for almost $40. About 4 years ago, we paid about $15 for it. The cars that come with it are the only ones that work well on this track. Hotwheels or Matchbox cars are not shaped correctly to be used with this toy. It is also noisy, making the same revving noise over and over and over. I can say that nothing broke on it, and it was still making noise when I gave it to a younger child a couple years ago. At about age 6, my son lost interest in this."
2,Short-Term,"My 3-year-old son received this toy as a gift. After racing the cars down the ramp a few dozen times, he tired of it. It hasn't been touched more than three times since. It's fun, for an hour, but not a toy kids return to over and over."
2,Not very fun,"Not much fun at all, very loud and annoying, seems cheaply made, you probably won't get the same item pictured, not worth buying."
2,"Not worth it, a yawner.","As other reviewers state- can only use the two cars that come with the toy. And even on hard wood floor the cars do not go far (because they are too light). Noise doesn't bother me compared to other toys. But my son's attention with this toy was very short lived. Shame, because it is made so well it will last forever. I don't even think I could feel fair selling this to someone, looks like it'll be a donation to a needy group."
3,Don't BUMP INTO THIS during naptime!! It's loud!,"I haven't figured out how to turn it OFF except to remove the batteries. At the lightest touch, nudge, or bump, the sound effects go off. VERY loud engine racing sounds. Which sucks when you're trying to pick up toys during naptime. It doesn't really do anything except just let two cars go down these spiral tracks. I think it would be good in a play area, like at a doctors office or something (except for the noise) where the kids would be playing with it for only 30 min or so. The novelty wears off quickly, then it's just a toy in the way. Most Matchbox sized cars do fit on the tracks so you can lose the two cars that come with it and use other cars."
2,Didn't go Over Very Well!!,My son loves all matchboxes and I thought for sure that he would love this toy!When in fact he hardly ever touches it.He has incorporated the two plastic cars that came with it into his collection but the speedway itself is virtuallu untouched.
4,Toy is still in one piece,"I am sure most of you can relate that toddler boys take everything apart and leave them in shambles around the house. Not this one. It comes in one piece and has stayed in one piece. The only complaint is the noise, but that can be remedied. The educational value, I suppose, is seeing how cars go down and seeing which is faster. My son has had it for a year and still plays with it from time to time."
3,Better for younger boys,"Perhaps my son is too old for this. We got it when he turned three, and it's sat on the shelf for a year. He takes it down and plays with it occasionally, but it really doesn't hold his attention. The best part was discovering that one of the cars goes faster when it's backwards. However, a 20-month-old friend of ours thinks this is great--he played with it for over an hour, which is a looong time for that age group."
4,VERY LOUD but fun...,"My 20 month old loves this but I think it is a bit loud. I don't like the fact that you cannot turn the sound off when you want, but they kids love it. The sound is triggered very easy also (barely touching the ramp)."
5,LOVE THIS TOY!!!,This toy is awesome! My goal this year was to find toys that come in one piece so my 3 1/2 year old son can't take it apart and quickly lose interest. This toy is great. It came in one piece with two cars and it's ready to go. It would make a great gift for someone as there is no assembly required. My 3 1/2 year old and 20-month old play with it often. We're all very pleased with this toy.
3,Great for Younger Kids,"This is a great toy for younger kids, but it would quickly bore any kid over four! It's very durable and all types of standard play cars would fit. The fun would lie in the fact that the kiddos could try all types of vehicles and see which one is really MORE powerful. Would make a nice gift for a younger child!"
3,Super Spiral Speedway - not for everyone...,We got this toy because my sister's son adored it. My two kids (2 and 4 at the time) were never that interested in it and didn't play that much with it after the first day or so. Later they got into other race tracks but the sameness of this experience - put the cars up - then they come down - just wasn't a hit. But - as I said - my nephew did love it... I wouldn't recommend this as a gift for a child over 3-4 though - I do have a hard time believing a 5-6 year old wouldn't have more fun with a more interesting track set-up. It is very well-made.
1,Waste of space,I am confused about the good reviews. Maybe our track is the only one with issues. The cars that came with it NEVER make it past the second turn. They either just stop or the top of the car gets stuck on the turn above. Anyhow it is a total disappointment. I should have kept the packaging to return it as it is now just taking up space. Don't waste your money.
2,Ended up on shelf after 1 week,"We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. He played with it a few times the first couple of weeks but has not touched it since.It does not seem as sturdy as our other Fisher-Price toys, although it has not broken, probably because it is not getting any use.He really loves the FisherPrice figure-8, motorized track - although it got so-so reviews, ours has worked perfectly and he uses it all the time."
5,"Worth the money, and I even like it as a Mom","This toy is worth the value. It's my two year old's gift, but my 5 and 7 year olds like it too. It only goes down the ramps, but it never fails, doesn't crash or fly off ramp, comes already put together, can play with it immediately - ready to go out of the package, sturdy, and I am usually quite critical when judging toys."
2,Most other cars won't go down the track....,"This was a gift for my son's 3rd birthday...it was great for about a day. When he tried using any of his hundred matchbox cars, we found that most of them are too big to race down the track. So if you only use the two cars that came with it, it's great. Also, the race sounds are very annoying (loud) and it's touchy- if you just pick it up to move it, it makes noise- even if you don't tip the top up. This went to Goodwill less than a month after he got it."
2,it is a different lower quality one they send you......,The item mailed was not the item pictured. It is a purple and yellow one that came and the cars were cheaper and not as well made as the one in the picture. We used to own the one in the picture so I am familiar with its quality. I am disappointed with how feminine the colors are and the reduced quality of the cars...especially the wheels. They need to change the photo to reflect the one they send you.
4,fun for 18 mo girl,We just got this and my 18 mo old loves it. The noises were annoying at first but we got used to them. I followed another reviewers advice and bought the mini adventure cars as back up cars for the ramp.Disney CARS Mini Adventures Sarge's Boot Camp 2-Pack Doc Hudson & MP SheriffDisney CARS Mini Adventures Radiator Springs 2-Pack Fillmore & MP Sarge
5,This music is terrific.,"""Alone"" is reminiscent of both classic rock and country music, but Brandy Wood transforms these forms to create her own unique style. Her voice is big and beautiful. The musical arrangements and instrumental backup are first rate. The tunes make you want to dance and move. The lyrics are understated and intelligent. All the songs are so good it's hard to name a favorite, but I especially liked ""Firecracker,"" ""True Love"" and ""When the Music's Done,"" which rises to a level of pathos that rivals some of the work of Eric Clapton. But at the same time, I could see any number of these songs becoming Top Ten singles. They have the simple accessibility of hits. I plan to live along time with this CD and get to know it well. Many thanks to the artist and her associates for this wonderful creative work."
1,NOT what I expected,"I was looking for a whimsical tablecloth that would certainly spice up any meal. When I saw this one, I thought I had found it. Unfortunately, I was very dissapointed when I got it. The fabric looks and feels cheap and the colors are washed out (not vibrant as in the picture). I would not recommend it."
1,"Get me a metronome, Please!","Edith. A prog band from Italy. The same country that gave the world Banco, PFM, Locanda Delle Fate, Le Orme, etc. Upon buying this CD, one expects to hear more of what Italy is famous for, such as lush classical passages and long instrumental breaks, right? WRONG. First of all, the music on this CD is devoid of any passion whatsoever, and just sounds like they are going through the motions. Second, the rhythm section DOES NOT WORK, period. The bass and drums plod through every song, ruining the music itself, sometimes by dragging the song down tempo wise, and other times just not hitting the notes in sync. Avoid."
2,"Awesome Watch, but didn't even last a whole month in the water!","I wouldn't say I am an avid swimmer, but within a month my watch was already chipping and now it won't work at all due to water leaking into the face. A little disappointed in the quality, and hoping that my replacement will be more sucessful."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH!,"When I saw this watch, I thought it was perfect! It had all the settings I wanted, the color and everything. It was working fine until I went swimming with it!!! Then it stopped working! Water got in, even though it says it is water resistent up to 100M.And, not only did this watch break on me, but another one exactly the same, also broke in the water too! How can this watch claim to be an Ironman Triathlon watch when it can't even go in the water and get wet?!!!!This happened to me twice on the exact same make and model of watch, so I would DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS WATCH TO ANYONE!!! It sucks. it is NOT water resistent or water proof and does not work in the water!!!! I am very, very disappointed with my purchase!!!"
2,Not water resistant,"These watches are beautiful and I have had 3 in the last 6 years or so...but every time they get wet, they break. Recently my watch was just sitting by the pool and it was still ruined after a little water splashed on it. Great watch but not if you are going to be around water (even out in the rain!)"
5,"Good value, good looks.",The watch is just what we wanted at a good price. It arrived just in time for our granddaughter's birthday. She loves it.
2,Waterlogged @ 35'; non-replaceable band came off in 2 months.,"Bought 3 one of these. The watch is easy to see, has 3 alarms, and has nice colors.But, the bands are not replaceable (they stretch off the watch) and the lighter colored ones show dirt, and some of the dirt can't be cleaned off. The band on 1st watch gave out after one year. The 2nd watch didn't survive beginning open water diving (20 minutes at a maximum of 35'). The band on the 3rd watch lasted only two months."
1,Band is Weak,"The watch itself is fine, but the band stretched and finally broke within 3 months. I was constantly trying to put it back on and finally it snapped!"
3,Band discolored immediately- band broke long before watch died,"The functionality of this watch is great, but the band is terrible and it doesn't seem that it's possible to buy a replacement band.Within weeks of buying this watch, the band started picking up discolorations which couldn't be cleaned off. A shame, but not a deal breaker.The deal breaker, and the reason I only rated it three stars, is that the band started separating from the watch face and then the piece holding the strap together broke after only a year. I've had several other Timex Ironman watches in the past that had replaceable watch bands, so although the plastic band always broke before the watch died, it wasn't a big deal. There don't seem to be replacement bands for this watch, making it all but useless even though it's still running."
3,Nice until it dies,"After a year of wear, turned out to not be waterproof. But I enjoyed it for a year, it's an otherwise good watch."
2,Awesome for ONLY 1 Year,"This watch has great features! I run and bike a lot and wore the watch 24/7. I even swam in it some. This watch was great for a while, even with the band becoming stained. After about a year the band started peeling away from the watch face. I kept popping it back together and even gluing it, but eventually the whole thing just popped out. I was very disappointed! I have never had this much trouble with an ironman watch and have owned a few in the past. I was definitely expecting it to last longer than it did. Buyer beware!!"
5,Awsome Watch,"I love this watch. It is very easy to use. I mainly use the countdown timer, it works great. I like the time and date displayed at the same time. Yes, I would recommend this watch."
5,Review of theTimex Women's Ironman Sleek 50/100 watch (T5B721),"I have recently bought the timex woman's Ironman watch.Too which i took this with me, whilst watching my other half compete in Ironman Austria 9th of July 2007.I found this watch particularly handy as following the race I was able to keep up to date times, which i relayed home as the Ironman site was very slow and at one point stopped giving up-dated times.I would strongly advice the purchase of this watch not only for the features but also for the sleek, comfortable and stylish must have watch."
1,Watch Strap Woe,"I have owned some form of Ironman Timex for as long as I've been old enough to wear a watch. Every watch from this line has lasted for a minimum of 3 years before the strap breaks or I misplace it. I have small hands and wrists, so was excited about the slimmer look and thrilled with the standard Timex functions I'm so familiar with: the back-light, 50 lap recall, a daily alarm, and water resistance. I have a moderately active job, so I expected the inevitable scratches on the face of the watch, and the band fit snugly on my wrist without cutting off circulation or getting in the way of my daily activities. What I did not expect was the fact that the face started fogging up after 5 months. Soon after, the strap and the center piece separated, and no amount of super glue could put them back together with any satisfaction. I absolutely recommend Timex, but the new ""Sleek"" design isn't a good choice out of the product line."
1,"SMOKE, MIRRORS AND EMPTY PROMISES","As many other people have done, I purchased the watch because of previous reputation. The company has done a full 180 from the past. Lots of flash, bling, self generated reviews, empty promises and a poor quality workmanship. First and foremost, keep it away from water. During a race, we went under a sprinkler system and the watch got a little wet. When we passed the finish line, 1/2 hour later, it fell apart. It was full of water inside, the band and buttons fell off. One person said to me when I was picking up the parts from the street ""Oh, it must be a Timex, right?"" What junk. As far as the warrantee it is only valid if you kept it in the original box, never used it and kept 100' from water. I'm going back to Casio. No bling, pomp and circustance, just reliability."
4,styling functionality,"Great features -- easy to use while running, but not particularly durable -- the band falls apart. This is my wife's third in 3 years. Despite limited durability, cost, looks, and features rate it 4 stars."
2,Not water resistant,"This watch has worked well for me as a running watch for about 6 months, but I agree with those who said that it's not water resistant. I wore it in the baby pool with my kids where it was never more than inches under water and not for very long each time, and the watch filled with water. I dried it out and it still works fine, but it's certainly not a watch to wear swimming. (and my watch is indeed blue, not at all purple)."
2,"warning: the wristband is purple (looks faded blue in the picture, but its a bright glowing purple)","i chose this watch because its blue color perfectly matched my wife's running outfit and her gym bag. sadly when the watch arrived the wristband was PURPLE not blue.i called in and amazon couldn't help me. they looked at the picture and said that the image was indeterminate - could be blue, could be purple. but, in reality the picture is a pretty faded blue and the watch itself is nothing like the picture, it is instead a bright glowing purple.they said return the item and choose another one, which is frustrating, time consuming, and another two weeks without a watch.otherwise the watch seems to be great. works great. has great features. too bad ugly. who wants a bright purple watch?"
1,bought this make and model twice--failed me both times,"I bought this watch in the same make and model twice. I loved the color and the many functions and still do BUT they were both not water resistant. Like many others before me have said, once it got wet, it died on me. The first time this happened it died after about 8 months and I thought it was just a fluke. So I bought this same watch again and it died on me in less than 6 months this time after being exposed to water. I used to think timex ironman triathlon watches were great because I got a black one just like this 5 years ago with the same exact functions and it actually was water proof. But after about 3 years of extreme wear and tear the strap got hard and broke. However, I would prefer 3 years of good use to 6 months of limited use. Don't make my mistake!"
1,Un-Wearable,"Don't Bother - Avoid the InsanityI have had my heart broken by too many of these styles of ironman watch. The watch itself is Good, but the wristband does not last longer than a year. Then you are stuck with a watch that works but is un-wearable because there is no way to replace this type of band. NO Band Available.I know because I have 5 watches (so obviously I liked the watch mechanism) - At first I thought it was just a fluke that the wristbands broke. But I finally remembered - a definition of insanity is repeating the same action over and over and expecting different results.Now some of my watches are still ticking away in a drawer because there are No replacement wrist bands. It doesn't matter how great the watch I s- if you can't wear it"
2,Terrible for the price :o(,Bought this just over a year ago and the strap is falling apart :o( I wear my watches daily and do a lot of physical activity so I need them to be able to take a lot of abuse.....this one did not perform well at all. The color fades to a yucky tarnished brown color....pretty for a few months and then....well yuck! Since you can't change out the strap this thing is a terrible waste of money.....now I have to buy a new watch and it won't be one with this type of strap. The strap has a wider end to it and it keeps catching on everything! Oh and did I mention that the strap has stretched and stretched.....I was using it on hole #3 and now it's on #5 and still stretching......just NOT a good buy.
1,Timex quality control isn't what it used to be,"Poorly made. Bought it for my wife for Christmas. After 3 months of swimming with it, there is water/mist inside it. Of course, I can't find the receipt, so I can't return it under warranty."
2,I don't recommend this watch.,"I have nothing against the functionality of this watch--I'm a soccer referee, and I have no qualms about trusting it to time the games. But it fell apart. The swooshy-looking part of the frame around the watch face has popped off--I can pop it sort of back on, but if I bend my wrist it pops off again. It still stays on my wrist, and I still have it and wear it occasionally because I don't often need a watch, but I'm getting a new one. If you want a cheap, working sport watch and don't care how it looks, this one is acceptable. Otherwise, I'd say give it a miss."
5,Solid Watch,"I do not swim at all so I only use this watch for running, but it's perfect for that. Nothing fancy, but exactly what you need. Hours, minutes and seconds displayed clearly, large ""start"" button and a light. Stylish and comfortable. Can't beat it for $35!"
1,Wish I had listened to reviews saying not water resistant,"Sadly enough, I had the same experience as several others. I have owned (and loved!) about 5 Ironman watches in the past 12 years. My husband about the same. In the past it seems the band dies far before the watch does. I had this watch less than 2 months and it got all clouded from water exposure (swimming laps). Dried it out in instant rice in a bag. Same thing happened again. Called Timex and they told me to send it in and they would check it out for some ridiculous fee (about as much as I paid for the watch - no thanks). Continued to wear it and then battery died. Replaced battery with a new one and watch still would not work. Done with Timex for now. Watch lasted less than a year easy. Got a new Polar that has an easy change battery feature. I love it!"
2,Did not last long,"I had about 9 months use out of this watch. I wore for swimming a lot, and one day it clouded up and then went blank. The multiple functions worked okay while they were operating. Watch faded in color. A little pricey to only last a short time."
2,Not a waterproof watch,"I love the look of this watch and it works great in rain or dry conditions. But it just can't take the water. This is my 2nd watch in a year that has gotten condensation inside and been ruined. The first one failed within the first month, after swimming laps in the pool. The second lasted about 9 months and did fine in the pool, but couldn't handle my trip to the beach last week. Ugh! Time to stop buying this watch and try a different one."
1,strap is crap,"Should have read the reviews. But since my husband was happy with his Timex Ironman, I thought I'd try one too. After only 6 months of use ( and only on weekends), the watch part popped out of the strap support, and just doesn't stay in place when you try to hook it back in. The watch may keep on ticking, but the strap is useless, effectively making the whole watch useless."
1,Band Falls Off,"I bought this watch because I liked the sleek design compared to the usual bulky sport watch. After only a few months the band began to separate from the watch, and was not repairable. I would not recommend this item."
1,very disappointing,"I am a loyal timex tri atch wearer- have worn nothing else for the last 25 years. I have had to return this watch for repair twice- just not up to their usual standards. Water got in the dial- they replaced it. I'm about to send it back since the side of the strap has come loose and will permit the watch to leak again. Also the band soils very easily. there are other, better watches from timex."
3,don't buy for timer,"I need a watch for timing things ALL the time, on a daily basis. I bought this watch because it has multiple alarms and a timer that can be set for up to 24 hours. Sounded great, but the timer is a waste of time to set! You have to push four different buttons many times each to set the timer. How ridiculous! I could practically time an egg more efficiently by just standing there and counting to 180. Plus, the watch beeps until you push a button to stop it, so if you have your hands full when it goes off, it just goes on and on and on...I am returning the watch and getting something else."
1,Eats Batteries and Button flew off after two years,I bought this watch from Wal-mart summer 2006 and it has been less than two years and I am on my third battery. After a few months the band became discolored. A month ago the mode button broke off and needless to say I am searching for a new watch. I ware the watch every day and have not been very rough with the watch but it is worn out. I think I am done with Timex for a while.
1,Damaged,Product arrived damaged with a button that had fallen off. I had to glue it back on? I hope it stays?
3,Okay for the beginner,"I was looking for something more advanced in the way of parrot training.I do recommend this book for the new parrot owners. It will help them get over some of the rough spots when dealing with those little monsters wrapped in feathers.As always, Barbara did an excellent job."
1,Too basic,What she teaches in her DVD's can be easily found on Youtube for free. Wish I sent this back before my return time was up.
3,Dinner for 2,"I'm slightly impressed. I just finished ""Dinner With A Perfect Stranger"" by David Dregory and 100 pages later (yes it's that short) I'm thinking ""what a cool concept!"" It was short, sweet, and to the point. Not something I would normally pick up but still a decent read. Basically, a guy named Nick gets a dinner invitation from Jesus and even though he thinks it's a joke he shows up to the Italian restaurant to meet the Savior. Over wine, veal, and tiramisu Jesus and Nick have a battle of the wits over theology, belief, and heaven. By desert Nick is finally convinced that he is sitting with the real Jesus Christ, not some weird impersonator. Cheesy, happy, etc., etc. It was a cool concept although I believe it could have been pulled off a little better. Still though, not a bad read. God knows I wouldn't have shown up to a restaurant to meet Jesus Christ if some weird invite came in the mail.""I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review"""
4,A light but thoughtful read,"I enjoyed this book. It was light and easy to read, but thought-provoking as well. It didn't bog the reader down with heavy religion, but made it's point so well, you felt like you were there with the characters, but not intimidated. Intelligently written, but I only wish it hadnt ended so abruptly..I wanted MORE at the end!"
5,"Dinner was probably $75, the Invitation was PRICELESS","I laughed and cried. What an amazing quick read! This book simplifies complicated questions we all have probably asked.It's short, it's simple, and it is profound. Jesus is the Star and Nick is the co-star. Nick receives an invitation to dinner with Jesus. Many subjects are covered over dinner. Nick, the skeptic who thinks the whole thing is just his buddies playing a joke on him, doesn't hold back on his sarcastic responses, questions and comments. The author did a fabulous job of writing and hitting on some of the great all-time questions many of us have. For those of you who have read the bible, you'll love it. For those of you who haven't, it's gonna make ya think!!"
5,This book says what I have a hard time saying,"Although I'm a strong believer and born-again Christian, I'm not much of an evangelist. To me this book is a wonderful tool for the evangelism-impaired like me to give to family and friends to show them Jesus and why my faith means everything to me. Thank you David Gregory, this little book is inspired."
5,Best Book I Have Ever Read,This was the best book I have ever read in a long time. I actually felt like I was sitting right there with Jesus too.It was a book that was very hard to put down. It really madeyou think about life and how we live our lives. I highlyrecommend this book for anyone to read. Ann Linvill
5,Dinner with a Perfect Stranger,One of the best books I've ever read. Why do we make things so complicated when it's very simple? This is the answer!! Could not put down and could read over and over. David Gregory is a wonderful storyteller.
5,Definitely an Invitation Worth Considering,This book had been recommended by a friend. It was a quick read and definitely got me to thinking what my reaction would have been. I intend to pass it on to another friend.
1,"Intriguing title, but no story -- just Sunday school pap","This book was a big disappointment for me. The writing is competent, but there's no real story. This is just another evangelical anti-intellectual sermon. People of faith can do better than this.What puzzles me is the author marquees his academic credentials, but his content rarely rises above Sunday school quality. It's just straw men and straw arguments, which the character of ""Jesus"" here backhandedly knocks down with a smugness that is extremely unappealing. The author's oversimplification of other religions is ludicrous.Think how much more interesting the dialogue would be if this ""Jesus"" could have dinner with the Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh, Rabbi Harold Kushner, Richard Dawkins, or even non-evangelical Christian thinkers like Karen Armstrong and Marcus Borg...But the intent here was never intellectual honesty."
2,Chick Track in Novel Form,"I was intrigued by the idea of a conversation with Jesus. I approached the novel knowing that it was work of Christian evangelism, but I was prepared to enjoy it. This sort of thing can be well done, and from the outset I thought it might be. Jesus is introduced as an unassuming, tender, and good-humored man, while Nick is the typical human. Unfortunately, the book's story does not last long: it soon turns into an author tract, and ""Nick"" becomes nothing more than a sock puppet. ""Jesus"" does a good job of portraying a superficially cohesive vision of Christianity, but it is one that does not stand to scrutiny. The conversation quickly becomes one-sided and shallow, doing an injustice to both Christianity by rendering it this way and to the many counter-ideas misrepresented as as straw-men. It looked to be a meaty read, but all I found was distasteful gristle."
4,Worth the read,"Truth be told, I received this book to review a LONG time ago. Like, almost a year ago. I am not sure why, but I simply didn't feel the desire to read it. Strange because it is a very small book. In fact, I just read it within the last hour. My thoughts, why has this book been sitting on my shelf for so long? It was great. As I do with all books I receive for review, I just wrote my name and the year in the back, and I will now pass it on to someone else. OK, onto the book.It was a great read. I loved the idea of dinner with Jesus. I loved that the character was a stranger but likely won't stay that way! I enjoyed the factual information on various other religions. The setting and the characters were all basic. The focus was on the truth. There isn't much to say, it's worth the read as a Christian. More than that, it's a great small book to put it the mailbox or with a gift for an unbeliever.I could have read more; I didn't want it to end."
4,David Gregory,The author has a gift of writing a modern day story and keeping the reader assured that Jesus is a real person.
5,Dinner with a Perfect Stranger,"This book is great! It is only 100 pages . It gets 5 stars from me! If you believe in Jesus this book just helps you more in your faith,if not this book just might help you rethink why not! I found myself myself wanting to have dinner with Jesus. This book was recommend to me from my sister. I will be looking for more books from this author!"
3,A unique approach to an old idea,"Gregory has a new and unique approach to an old idea, writing about being a dinner guest who has an encounter with Jesus. He describes in detail what might have happened covering an account of his personal life.A part of the narrative is a point-counter-point dialogue questioning Jesus' authenticity and right to engage the author with personal questions and directives. Another part is Jesus answering the guest's questions about heaven, hell and eternal life. It was troubling to read Jesus' answer about obtaining eternal life, mentioning only to trust God, and omitting the other requirements found in the Bible.All this is done under well arranged chapters titled ""Invitation"", ""The Seating"", ""The Menu"", ""The Appetizer"", ""The Salad"", ""The Main Course"", ""The Dessert"", ""The Coffee"", and even, ""The Bill"".I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Press in their blogging for books program. Opinions expressed in this review are my own."
3,Dinner with a Perfect Stranger: a good Idea.,Dinner with a perfect stranger is a great little book that is similar to The Shack in its premise but without the nonbiblical ideas. David Gregory does a very good job of exploring apologetics in a way that promotes evangelism.A great easy read I would recommend this book for readers of all levels and every person in the church from a youth to an adult could benefit and enjoy this read.I received this book fro free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
4,Walk with Jesus beginner,Wonderful and practical way of presenting Jesus and the challenge of knowing him more. I enjoyed the concept and recommend it for new Christians.
5,"Basic, solid, provocative","The book and companion movie are a basic but powerful introduction to Christianity without lots of religous words. It answers age old questions in a simple, straightforward, and provactive way. A great introduction to someone who has some interest in religious ideas but still has lots of questions."
2,Not sure how many starts to give this book,"I see this book as fiction ONLY just, like The DaVinci Code was nothing more then fiction. This book did confirm one thing that a Christian friend said, but other then that the book is fiction. I think that Gregory is a good storyteller, but I certainly would not consider this book a book to put next to my other books of religion. I will put it next to the DaVinci Code and believe I read a great fiction and nothing more.I do want to thank D. Washington for the review and biblical reference and good viewpoint for those who would consider this book more then fiction. I would like to thank Enchanted One for the review also.If this book were a `religious' book I would give it one star, (less if I could), but I am seeing this book as a fiction, so I will give it two or three stars for a fiction. Two stars for the lack of character depth, but three for a good idea.I like a good a fiction and mystery as much as the next fiction and mystery lover does."
5,Refreshing Perspective,"I read this book in less than two hours and thoroughly enjoyed it! A refreshing view on the true underlying difference of Christianity and other religions. I defy anyone to tell where the author is wrong in his points regarding ""other religeons."" No heavy theology here, just a common sense approach that will make you rethink your perspectives."
5,A Wonderful Experience,"A quick, easy read. Couldn't put book down and have reread at least 5 times learning something new on each reading."
2,A Serving of Pablum,"Trite, predictable, uninteresting, unchallenging, and more. A peculiar little book that did nothing for my faith. I want something that stretches or even challenges. This appeared to be narrow, party propaganda. Perhaps, however, this is for someone who has never heard of Christianity. I am also troubled at the numbers who raved about this book. That fact, to me, is a sorry commentary on the depth of Christianity in America. St. Paul indicated that, ""When I was a child, I thought like a child."" Now that I am a man, I need something more."
5,A excellent introduction to Digital Electronics and Logic,This kit and book might just light a spark in a childs mind. Great and easy to understand projects using common components and integrated circuits. You can even get all of the chips and components from this book at Radio Shack and reproduce some of the projects on your own. The 10 Led Chaser/Sequencer makes really cool fake car alarm warning lights for your dash. The authors choice of components is great because it simplifies the circuits you build quite a bit. Putting the breadboard together you experiment on is very easy. I don't really have anything bad to say about it. Please be careful with the chips until you understand the way they work. They are CMOS and easy to damage if wired wrong. CMOS chips can also be damaged by static so you don't want to go scuffing your feet across the carpet before using the kit. Just touch your kitchen faucet and get rid of the static electricity in your body before touching the chip leads.
4,Works good with judicious technique,"The 3600 rpm standard electric motor speed is much too fast for the application, and the high velocity impacts causes the whip line to shatter, which is the same for ALL plastic whip lines. Idiot manufacturers need to engineer a speed reducer. I am careful to minimize hitting hard edges with the whip line. Where the whip line exits the trimmer head, I have filed a smooth bevel/radius to remove any corner/edge, because any sharp corner will nick the hardish plastic whip line and begin a fatigue crack with subsequent much shorted life. With these techniques, I normally replace the whip lines after a good duration of use due to wearing down from the tip, as it should be. Have never had one separate from the brass ferrule. Based on the good results with the Weed Tiger, I'm thinking of engineering a wire cable whip to see how it goes."
4,what are you putting them on?,"I put these on a large gas trimmer and used them on medium sized sunflowers. They lasted longer than the string, but after some abuse they did wear down and break off. They ran for about one tank of gas. The string was constantly breaking off had to be extended 6X per tank of gas. For the application, I think they did ok, but if you buy them expecting to use them hard and have a set last all summer, that's unlikely. If you trim grass with a medium sized gas or electric trimmer, stay away from rocks and larger weeds they will probably last longer."
3,Great Idea... Mediocre Results,"This is a great idea if you are fed up with bump and feed trimmer head problems. Just slide in a couple of these guys through existing holes in your trimmer head and go to work. The problem is that the plastic is brittle. I've run through two bags of them. You've got to be extra careful about sharp objects because they'll snap right off. I could live with this... but you don't get very many for the price. And why the brass heads? Why can't someone simply injection mold this type of thing, with a plastic head and produce... like 50 of them for the same price. Seems like there has to be a market! Try and find any trimmer head that uses pre-cut straight line or any other type of pre-cut line like the Tiger... It is hard to do. I can't find any..."
3,"Ok, but not great",The line didn't fit the hole in my weed eater so I had to make it bigger. It was no problem but I was disappointed in how long the line lasted. I thought for the price it should have been tougher.
1,Huge Disappointment,"This product was a huge disappointment to me. These trimmers were supposed to last much longer than regular line, but they didn't for me. They were easy to install, but their life was no better than a comparable diameter line I have used for years."
1,i hate this product,i bought this product for $30.00 so i could do my hair for valentines day well lets just say that was a big mistake my hair looked horrible i looked like a witch it made my hair very frizzy i even sprayed something that they recomended at the beauty store but it didnt help i ended up jumping back in the shower to get my hair back to normal. at first i thought it was my fault that i didnt know how to use it so i decided to try a different brand that was half the price and lets just say i loved the results the waves looked so beautiful so i think you should pass on this one and try a different brand
4,"Raccoons, definately a slice of good ol' Canadiana!","Okay picture quality and sound. Crappy Box and Cover Art. And only 3 episodes per disc! (uh huh, a box set with 9 episodes!)But the Raccoons are great fun, definately a set to buy if you are a fan!"
4,Excelent,"Received item as stated. Took a little longer than I expected, but no worries. All was awesome! Will continue service."
4,There are some real nuggets of wisdom but not easy to implement,"After finishing this book I've learned the basic principle of being an active listener and asking the ""right"" questions to involve the client. Now the hard part, implementing those principles. This book does a decent job of describing techniques to do just that but this transformation of sales seems like it could take a bit of time. Now I understand it's simply a matter of changing habits but as a sales trainer, I'm not sure salespeople will have the patience and buy in to see this through. In summary, valuable lessons, but not sure they will work for the average salesperson."
2,Boring and of Little Value,"I had to read this book recently and I found it exceedingly tedious and boring. Of course you really shouldn't expect much more from a book about how to sell. I work in sales and most of what you read in this book, you will find are easily taught methods that are somewhat commonplace in the sales industry. It should be easily understood that salespeople should listen to the customer rather than just talking over their customer. Questions are also well understood as a method for determining how a product will benefit a customer and enable the sale. Overcoming objections should be another obvious attribute that a salesperson has to learn and pick up. Most companies teach these skills already to their sales force."
5,Awesome!,This is the nicest pie dish I've ever seen. I dont even make pies but I got it to use for serving or to make casseroles or even to use for baking miscellaneous things. It's diameter is bigger than average and deeper too. The color is deep and rich. I got the cobalt. I will find a place to display this dish it's so pretty. Got one for my friend too. She loves it as much as I do. At 20.00 and free shipping you gotta try this ! Maybe I'll even try a PIE !
3,Damaged,"I've ordered other Emile Henry items from amazon which have all arrived in perfect condition. However, this creme pie plate just arrived today and it has manufacturer defects. There are small holes (one around the top of the rim and one in the basin which were obviously made before or while the dish was in a kiln (as they are permanent and under the glaze). I'm dissapointed that Emile Henry would sell one of their pie plates like this, as it is not in perfect condition.Still, I feel like it's not worth returning it and then having to re-order another one (since you cannot exchange on amazon)."
3,Not on the level of The Olden Domain,"It must have been hard to have a follow up on their previous album, because The Olden Domain is one of the greatest metal albums of all time. I do still enjoy this CD, but it lacks enough brutality and ICS Vortex's incredible voice would be better used with power metal ala Iced Earth. In memory of Borknagar's fallen blaster, Grim, may he rest in peace in the great hall of Valhalla up in Asgard next to the mighty Odin himself..."
2,Snoozing at the end,"This book started off excellent. The 1st story was very interesting and at the end I wanted to know what happen to Antone and Rita. It would have been nice to know if Rita and her family made it out. I was left hanging. The 2nd story started off slow but progressed nicely and wrapped up at the end. The 3rd story was good but as disrespectful as Desiree was, her mother was nice to tolerate her. I think the story wrapped up nicely.I also think Mia made decisions that were best for her and couldn't continue living her life for grown or almost grown children. The 4th story was flat out boring from the beginning to end. I have dealt with the caring of an elderly grandmother and watched almost the same scenario play out. The story was dragged out tooooo long."
5,Great resource of real card magic!,"Don't be put off by the price. This volume contains a surprising number of great tricks, and clearly explains a good number of the basic techniques. It is written for the beginner, but it is fairly comprehensive, and the intermediate card magician will find much here as well. Come on, even if I'm wrong, look how much money you're out."
3,good for beginners of Floyd guitar,"The last review was a fair assessment, as is a 3 star rating. I'd say the mix of songs included is pretty good but the detail is just not there if you want to learn Gilmour's trademark solos and melodies. However, as Gilmour put it, nobody in the band was very good at complicated chord structures and most of their songs are fairly straightforward. So even a novice should be able to pick up the gist of their songs with this book. That's probably all you should take from it anyway, the big picture, because Pink Floyd have always been a band where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. One glaring error, however, is that Astronomy Domine is in the wrong key...but otherwise a great tool for Floyd fans of their earlier work."
3,Sam Cooke the Complete Recordings,"I remember growing up listening to Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers so I was excited when I saw this compilation. I was, however, disappointed to find that on each cd, 3 in all, about 1/3 of the cds consisted of alternate takes on the same song. I would not recommend this if you are looking for a complete collection of Mr. Cooke's work with the Soul Stirrers"
4,Even atheists like the Soul Stirrers!,"As much as I can't stand religion and all the mindless violence, segregational differences, and pointless hatred it creates, I can still sit down and listen to grade A gospel like the soul stirrers. After all, it's not like they're singing about blowing up abortion clinics or chanting God hates fags."
5,Best Collection on the Market,This is the best Same Cooke and Soul Stirrers collection that I have found on the market. It contains all of his speciality recordings. One thing that I enjoy are the master cuts that were never released and the few live concert releases. Sam Cooke had an amazing voice. I grew up listening to the Soul Stirrers every Sunday evening on the radios and blaring from the homes of our neighbors. It was great to find this collection on Amazon and at a very affordable price.
5,excellent,"I received my multiple cds in a timely manner, and they were all in terrific conditions. I would most definitely order again and again."
5,As good as it gets,"Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers are as good as it gets, in mine humble opinion. While there may be too much for the casual listener (3-4 takes of certain songs), to an admirer of Cooke and gospel music in general, this is superlative collection. These discs stand up to repeated listenings, and deepen each time. Sam's vocal ""battles"" with Paul Foster, the second lead, are just amazing."
2,"Some Good Moments, but you have to dig deep...","A collection of ""TV and library music,"" almost all of this is electronic music. No vocal tracks. Some guitar snippets. Most of this is song fragments. Recommended only for diehards, or those who like Ant's electronic works particularly. I wasn't very impressed, although at times I found it an odd and interesting collection of song fragments..."
5,I LOVE HER!,I HAVE THIS DOLL AND I THINK SHE IS JUST BEAUTIFUL. HER SKIN IS TANNED TO A BEAUTIFUL!!! COLOR AND I LOVE HOW HER LIGHT BROWN HAIR HAS STREAKS OF BLONDE IN IT. I ALSO THINK HER CLOTHES ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL. ALSO SHE COMES WITH REALLY NEAT ACCESORIES MY FAVORITED BEING THE CHAIR FOR HER TO SIT ON. I LIKE SITTING MY BARBIES ON CHAIRS AND THIS IS ONLY THE 3RD CHAIR I'VED EVER GOTTEN SO FAR WITH A BARBIE SO I THINK THAT REALLY ADDS TO THE VALUE. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS BARBIE DOLL.
1,whos idea was this????,"i want to know which matell goon thought of this stupid idea? a ear piercing barbie? what were you thinking? this shows young girls that it is ""fun"" and ""cool"" to pierce your ears your self. who knows, because of this toy girls could be running around piercing their ears with needles to be like barbie. even worse, they could pierce there friends ears! how horrible would that be? do yourself and your little girl a favor and don't buy this awful toy!"
4,Short and sweet,"A short (and sweet) summary of various possible online self-promotion techniques in one neat book. Because of its clear and systematic layout, it is great for refreshing all those techniques which we may already know."
4,Even if you think you know it all... you can learn more,"Keeping it short, I believe the information in this book is invaluable. I think anyone in business for themselves should take a look at what Benum has to say about Self Promotion. I've been a web professional for many years now, and a decent amount of what I read, I had already known about. However, there is a bountiful amount of ideas and information within the pages of this book that really opened my eyes to better promotion. You owe it to yourself to check it out. No matter how good you are at marketing yourself, you can be better. This book shows you how."
5,Right book at the right time,"Clear and to-the-point visual beauty of a book especially for those of us who have a domain name that has been sitting unused for 2 years! Well-organized, even for right-brain folks, it explains WHY you need to use the web as a promotion tool, in addition to all the other self-promotion activities, and HOW to create a streamlined presentation. If you need the nitties and gritties of HTML, go elsewhere; this book is about the big picture, to get you going in the right direction."
2,Very disappointed,"This poacher has worked well for the past two months we've had it. However, the eggs always stick to the poaching cups even with the use of oil and the cups are difficult to clean. Also, the pan started to chip and rust after the third use. We wash it by hand and use a mild soap but the chipping keeps getting worse. I can't recommend this product because the quality of the pan is poor."
2,Egg Poacher,"Had a old egg poacher that finally gave away. Found this one and purchased as soon as i could. Not very ""non-stick"" tried to poach eggs but they stuck. You need to spray with Pam in order for it to work."
3,"egg poacher the good, the bad","good, its teflon and not badly madebad cant remove eggs individually, so you have to work to get them out with out getting steam burns"
4,poached eggs,I loved poached eggs so this is just perfect for me. my old one had lost all its non stick properties
3,Ditto,Met all expectations. This rating system is taking too much of my time due to the requirement for more words than necessary..
2,Disappointing quality,"I've had this pan just over 3 months and have only used it a few times. Already the finish is coming off the bottom of the skillet. It is coated with a very thin layer of nonstick coating, which is not durable at all and not high quality. I have always washed it by hand, not in the dishwasher, so it hasn't been exposed to harsh conditions, other than boiling water on the stovetop. Other than that, the poachers work well, don't stick, and so far are not starting to peel."
2,Poor quality,"Product was okay for a few monrhs but then the non stick surface where the eggs cook began to come off; the pan which holds the water began to rust. We never put it in the dishwasher and was only used on average once a week. Now, I am looking for new one. I do not recommend this poacher."
2,Bottom peeling and rusting after using twice,"I love that this poaches eggs in 4 minutes and that the eggs come out with ease. HOWEVER, I used the skillet part to brown ground beef twice and eraser size holes appeared in the bottom. Thought I would just stick to boiling water and poaching eggs, but now the bottom is all rusty. Time to toss this out. I've had it about a month and used it about twice a week. I will invest in a new egg poacher/skillet combo with a better brand so it will last."
1,Dissatified,"The Norpro Egg poacher is no good. I returned it and got another one and the same thing happened again. TheNorpro 9.5 Inch Nonstick Egg Poacher Skillet Set with Removable 4 Egg Poachernon-stick material in the pan will start pealing, then it will rust."
1,"Bad design, cheap plastic or user error?","The pan handle broke the second time I used it. I probably over tightened it when originally installing it but it did not fit snugly against the pan with the metal spacer clip without wiggle unless tightened (or in my case, most likely over tightened). The poacher knob gets too hot to grasp with anything but tongs. It would be better if the lid were clear glass? The non-stick coating is good. The overall pan weight is good. It would be better if the poacher steam holes were slots so it could be picked up and handled with a fork. I'm looking for another pan that addresses the drawbacks mentioned."
4,Easy,"THe husband loves it. After hearing the stories of how he had one growing up, I decided to get one for him as a gift. He loves it and the reviews on amazon definitely helped me in teh search as I didn't know such a thing existed"
4,Norpro Egg poacher,It was a gift for my parents and so far they love it. Amazon was a great place to find what they were looking for.
1,NON-STICK COATING PEELS OFF,"I had high hopes for this product but it was not quality teflon and so the silver border around it was tarnishing and the teflon started to peel. Since this was made in China, most of the stuff is cheap material and not worth wasting your money on.Your best bet is to do it in water or I've had reasonable luck with the inserts that they sell in Bed & Bath or facsimile."
3,Liked the concept!!!!,"excellent, very well made...only problem was the escaped steam from the little vents made it a threat for burns to your wrists if there exposed"
4,good for the money,"confortable, cheap.. good for the money. it compares to Giro and other brands, but Pryme makes this durable and with the right features. You will like it."
2,Run as fast as you can to buy another book,Very incoherent and does not prepare you for the MCSE test. The book keeps jumping around... The CD is a definite thumbs down also! Run as fast as you can to buy another book!!!!!!
2,Not a good resource. There are much better guides available.,"The book made me think of a big box full of broken china. There is a lot in there, and if you are willing to work very hard you could make it usefull. SMS is a very complicated product and cheif among the goals of the writers should have been to make clear how the peices of the app. fit together. Look for another book."
2,"What a waste of time and $$$.No prep for MCSE,run dont walk","700 + pages and for what. The book will start to detail a feature that it has not mention up to that point in the book. As for MCSE,this book is about 30% of the test. For the time that is need to read/skip around, you could be reading the online help file for MUCH better test prep ""book"". At least it reads like a ""book"". MS Press should laugh out of business, when they can't print a book on their own product. Run don't walk to buy any other book on SMS 1.2"
5,A Sane Perspective on Religion,"An excellent read if you are looking for confirmation of the fact that all religious extremists are insane. This would, of course, include Muslim as well as Bible Belt loonies. Mr. Mencken was a long ways ahead of his time in recognising this and savages ALL religious dingbats, home grown or imported."
1,Prejudice in a neat little container,"If we spoke of blacks and Jews like the other commentators speak of Christians, they would no doubt be blacklisted and widely renounced. As it is, Mencken offers nothing to the intellectual study of religion and philosophy except for an eloquent way to say he ""doesn't like it."" None the less, it would appear from the reviews of others that if you agree with Mencken's athiest world-view, you will indeed enjoy having him fuel you fire. For me, I like a little more philosophy and a little less rhetoric."
3,David Wilhelm,"I think the author knows her stuff, but the quality of the pesentation is weak. The author sits at a table or stands and reads from a notebook, with pauses to catch up on her thoughts, etc. It would have been great to see examples or demonstrations or something to supplement the author's words."
4,Undergrounded or underrated,"Taking off is one of those movies which, for unknown and obscure reasons, disappeared from the broadcast scene despite their high potential to become ""Cult movie"". The story is nothing uncommon, but certainly well represents the athmosphere of the time and portraits a typical cultural/social issue of the '70s. The soundtrack is also enjoyable and songs like Where even horses have wings deserved better backup than that granted by the media when the movie was first distributed. To those who loved and still consider films like Easy Rider, Zabriskie Point and Jesus Christ Superstar worth having and watching as testimony of an era, I suggest the viewing of this movie too: it serves the purpose to recall memories of an era and reminds us (45+) that once we too had communication difficulties with the ""grown-ups""."
5,Best collection for Helloween 80s era,I just receive this CD yesterday which is also on the eve of Halloween. What a coincidence! Anyway all the tracks are during the 80s where Helloween is at their prime. However compare to Treasure Chest I still think this is the definitive Helloween collection...
4,Welcome back Tamara Leigh,"First and foremost, welcome back to the world of medieval romance Tamara Leigh.I have read every book that Tamara has published and never has she disappointed me. this holds true with her newest release, Blackheart. I loved her main characters and the secondary characters were well rounded leaving the opportunity open for sequels. I thought part of the story quite sad, but probably very true to the times. Though Gabriel seemed a harsh, uncaring man in some eyes, I think that he had always loved Juliana. she deep down abviously cared for him until she was fed the lies that would change all the lives involved. I really like Tamara's style of writing and I am looking forward to other books in the near future. I certainly hope that they include sequels to this book."
2,Rather sentimental,"A sentimental treatment of Therese's life; I'd look for something more vigorously written, and perhaps for a more contemporary treatment."
4,"Comfortable, but stretches","The pant sure is comfortable, but it kinda shapes up quite significantly based on how you use it. I like to sit on flat surfaces with my legs folded across, and the pant is now stretched about by knees.Also, this thing shrinks a bit.I would still buy it if I needed more though."
3,tooooooo big,"the material is OK. but toooo large (both wide and long) for a size S. Unfortunately, the price dropped after I bought it. 6 dollars is a reasonable price for this pair."
2,reebok fleece pants,I bought these as a gift for someone. They were very happy with the size and style.
1,Malpractice.,"Part Number AV21401-12 is a lower price. When you order they respond not have in stock.They place the same Part Number AV21401-12 at higher price.They play with the client. This is a bad practice.Careful when ordering, you will lose your time.Belkin AV21401-12 Home Theater Cable 12 ft"
3,Ford Explorer Mirror,The product was just as described. Only problem was that it took a little long to arrive. Ordered over the holidays and said it wwouold ship out in 3 days but did not ship for over 2 weeks.
4,Long Awaited,"This is a good Darkthrone album, a bit more accessible than some of their early work, but still a grim experience. It's simple atmosperic Black Metal, with a cold sound and no pretence for being new and groundbreaking. Tracks like ""In the Claws of Time"" sends shiver down my spine, Darkthrone is one of the few bands that still retain the old magic. Darkthrone don't have, to they were groundbreaking both with, Soulside Journey and A Blaze in the Northern Sky. Now they produce what they do best, True Black Art. The drumming of Fenriz is still simple and to the point, the guitars are like a buzzsaw and the vocals of Nocturno Culto haunting and grim."
3,Bottle holder too short for Dr. Brown's bottles,"In general I absolutely love the diaper bags and products made by baby innovations...however, i recently discovered right before my trip that the bottle holder on this bag does not hold the type of bottles I use---Dr. Brown's. The insulated pocket for the bottles was not tall enough for my bottles, making the pocket virtually useless. The other great features on this bag still make it worthwhile---specifically the velcro strap that enables it to attach to my luggage as I roll it through the airport. Also, the bag does hold alot of stuff and it features a front pocket that holds a cell phone and other necessities."
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"The Gooseberry Patch cookbooks got really good reviews, so I was looking forward to receiving this book. I was really disappointed. None of the recipes were appetizing enough to me to even attempt to cook them. I'm not a gourmet by any stretch of the imagination. All I was looking for was simple, tasty recipes. I will steer clear of this collection from now on."
3,Cuts fast in brick but poor design.,"This hole saw cuts very fast in brick. It cut way faster then a different brand that I paid $70 for. The problem is that it is attatched to a flange. That flange makes it impossible to cut deeper then 2.5"". If you look closely at the picture, you will see the black flange sticking out wider then the hole saw.If your project requires that you cut no deeper then 2.5"" then this saw would be very good for your project. The cost is right and it is very fast. If you have to cut deeper, you would need to look else where."
5,Full of the good stuff,"If loving God was a crime is my favorite BTR song, but this disc is full of them. Choose life, What would Jesus do, and Star in the book of life are also very good. If you have not listened to BTR then this is a great place to start. But if you have listened to them then get this one also. Full of the good stuff!!"
4,Still looks daunting,"THought it would be a good idea to try and save a few bucks and build this for my daughter. The plans are fairly vague in my opinion. I'm sure I can figure them out, but it wasn't as cut by the numbers as I was hoping. It feels like it's more of a loose guide as opposed to step by step instructions."
4,worth it.,i havent yet built the thing but it seems easy to fallow the included instructions. i must say i am looking forword to building this.
1,Worked well for a year,"This hoist worked well for a year then when a cold spell hit it wouldn't work at all. Once it warmed up the up control button worked but the down control button did not. Incidentally, the up button became functionally the down button and visa versa. Looked for the user manual and found no reference to the manufacturer probably because they don't want to hear from you when their product breaks down."
5,Funky Jazz,This album is outstanding. I've had a chance to see Ronny Loew live on several occassions and this album really captures and conveys his endless talent. Definitely one of the greatest saxaphone players emerging on the jazz scene. This album won't disappoint you.
4,Mambo Sons rocks!,"I bought this cd after seeing the band live, and enjoy it immensly. You will too if you like good songs and good guitar. My favorite tunes are Slipaway, Tomonga St. and Devil Moon, which is like CCR crossed with Bad Company. Rick Derringer (where is he these days) plays like 1976 withhis old bass player Kenny Aronson."
5,Favorite Baby Toy,Our twin girls love this doll. They are now 7 months old and play with it everyday. They like the crinkly dress and they use the rings to hold on to it. Claire is teething and she likes chew on the doll's feet since they are ribbed on the bottom. This is their favorite toy by far. I would definitely recommend it.
5,My daughter's favorite toy!,"We love this!! I bought this when my daughter, Abby, when she was 2 months old. She hated her car seat and would cry everytime she was in it. I decided that she needed a fun car seat toy. I looked at lots of them, but finally decided to get ""My Friend Emily"" for her, because of it's great reviews, and because it's so cute! I am so glad I did. They first time she saw it, she gave her dolly a huge grin. She's 3 months old now and it's still her favorite toy. She loves to grab on the rings and pull the dolly closer to her. She likes the bright colors of her dress too. Her favorite part though, I think is that the dress makes crinkly sounds whenever it's touched. I love that it has a clip/ring at the top so it can be attached to the care seat, stroller, crib, etc. and will be able to be used for a long time. I highly recommend this doll for your baby girl!"
5,My daughter loves this toy!,"This is the cutest little doll and my 3 month old daughter absolutely loves it! It has bright colors, the ""crinkly"" fabric that babies love, and lots of different textures. Plus, it has the little link so you can clip it on to a carseat, play gym, stroller, etc. My daughter's face lights right up and she smiles when I bring out ""Emily""."
4,No Bumps,Great product have been using it for the past year as recommended by a friend and my bumps and ingrowns have been reduced to a few if any.
1,Where is the rest of my order?,"I love the product, but I recommend against buying it from these sellers. Although I paid for six refill cartridges, I only received three. The phone number provided is never attended, and nobody responds to my emails."
1,I can't believe i'm the first 1-star review,"ok, first off, there is only a single bladefor the price of one single blade head, you could buy an M5 5-blade razorb) you have to stroke like 10 times on the same spot and still have hairs left, might as well use the norelco machine.and lastlyIII) when you do shave, its almost impossible for the head NOT to fall out. The way you place each head is by sliding it unto the tip of the handle. If you don't point the razor directly perpendicular while shaving, it WILL slide offthe way i do it (if i have more than a 2 day stubble) is use the norelco to cut it down real low, then shave with the M5.Not sure how other blades compare, but the M5 is pretty desecent and cheap."
2,Where's my order?,"Dear Amazon.com,I ordered one package of Bump Fighter Refill Blades in March. I was told that they couldn't send them to my home address so I requested that they be sent to my daughter's address. I received an email from ABC WHOLESALE saying they were returned ""UNCLAIMED"". My daughter has a locked mailbox and she never received them.I still would like to have them sent to me since I can't find them locally. I would not like to keep spending money to order them over and over with no good results.Neophia Moore"
3,not all good,When I use the bump fighter cream to get bumps off of my face it last about three days then get right back having bumps again. These razer refill blades isn't enough.
4,Excellant wipe-down product for use after each handing of my pistol!,"Just as description depicts, this is as excellant wipe-down product for use after each handing of my pistols- to stop any possibility of corrosion form skin oils!"
2,Completely Dry,Nice big flannel cloth. But as to the claim that it won't dry out? Received completely dry. It polishes just fine but I suspect no silicone is being left behind.
2,Not That Good,"I bought 5 of these (not from Amazon) and was not impressed. They were almost dry, and didn't do much.I much prefer the Hoppe's cloth's to these. They have more silicone and last much longer."
4,An impressive debut... it gets better from here.,"I love Theatre of Tragedy. This was their debut, and as such it seems a bit more raw than its successors. Not as consistent as Velvet Darkness They Fear and Aegis, but at points it surpasses them both. A Distance There Is and A Hamlet For A Slothful Vassal are two of the best TOT songs yet. For the record, the vocal work is better than on Velvet Darkness, but not at the level of Aegis. A Worthy Purchase."
3,"Keep the Beauty, Kill the Beast","There is some great music, lots of talent, and a great female singer in this goth or Beauty & the Beast metal band. The male Beast grunts or conflict singing ruins it for me. If you like those male grunts alot then you should love this album, but I may not be able to stand it much and may have to put it down, or let it go as a flying frisbee. I give it 3 stars because I have not given up yet on being able to tolerate the grunts. If I lose that battle then the album is less than one star for me, in fact it will be gone as far as I can throw it."
1,nice product but does not fit the sink that it was surpose to,"Was told that it fit the 2033 swanstone sink, but it arrived and did not and I had already had seasoned it."
3,not the best run dmc song but cool,run and dmc keep it tight features pete rock and cl smooth 93 was a good year.
4,Very valuable but not the best,"This book ia packed with helpful ideas, tips and suggestions for using, making and presenting flip-charts efficiently and creatively. It is a wonderful resource for anyone who wishes to learn new techniques and also as a reference for any presentation skills workshop.However, despite the graphics and the 'white space' you find yourself somewhat bored by them after a while. All the pages look very similar and there is almost no variation in the layout."
3,It's okay -- but I was hoping for more...,This is a good beginning book for those who have never created flip charts. Unfortunately I was looking for a book with more drawings / pictures that can be used on flip chart. I highly recommend Robert Lucas' Big Book of Flip Charts. Other easy to draw illustrations that can be used for such charts can be found in any of the books by Ed Emberley. Preview the books at your local library -- you'll then want to purchase them for later use.
3,I didn't really enjoy this book,This book was not that good because it was sad and so many people died. It was very depressing. I recommend this book to people who enjoy sad stories.
5,Wonderful Blending of Talented Authors,Aloha is a wonderful blending of fantastic talent. All four author's stories were in sync with characterization and continuity. I loved all four stories and if you like reading contemporary romance with fabulous heroes in a romantic Hawaiian series I could not recommend it more highly.
1,Sappy,"There is sappy and then there is SAPPY. A collection of sappy faux-romantic tales. And I one who has traveled quite a bit in Hawaii... lacks authenticity as well. There are other romances set in Hawaii that are much, much better."
4,Race is indeed a key factor in crime,"After going through this book I realized a couple of things. For starters, the author of this book was my professor so it was very important for me to read and remember everything from the book.This book helped me realized that race has a big factor in identifying crime. Mostly African Americans commit crime, and Hispanics are in second place. And it goes beyond that. It also explains that for African Americans and Hispanics have tougher times finding jobs. Not because background checks showed they once committed a crime, but just the fact they are African American or Hispanic is the cause of it. Society put a stereotype on ethnic groups and because of that stereotype, certain people who certain ethnicities have a tougher time get a job.A great book to read for either knowledge and pleasure, or for a class."
2,Didn't hold up,"This lunch box was great at keeping hot things hot in the top and cool things cool in the bottom, however it didn't last an entire school year. The lining began to separate at the seams on the inside, which made it impossible to clean. Not worth the money for such a short life."
2,made cheaply,I was excited by the design for my son's school lunches as there is plenty of room for a thermos a couple of juice pouches and on top a zippered comparment for snacks. The inside of the top compartment however already pulled away from the seam in the top compartment. The inside is not made of durable material and I will probably only make a year with this lunch bucket if we are lucky. I would not purchase again.
3,Color was not as advertised,"I ordered this lunch box to replace an older, worn out California Innovations lunch box. It doesn't really compare to my older one in quality or features. The lunch box pictured on the web site is red and black with white stripes. The lunch box I received is light grey and black. I am very disappointed with the color and upset that I was deceived!"
4,Bury Me Standing,"If you've ever been curious about gypsies, Bury Me Standing is an excellent work, based on the author's very close contact with gypsies from several different countries. Besides the bit of history (or what is known), she goes in great detail about their lifestyles. She does not sugarcoat gypsy culture, admitting they lie, beg (however unsuccessfully), even steal, but some misinformation about them is clarified. It is in the second half of the book that the author, Isabel Fonseca, reminds the reader of how the gypsies, like the Jews before them, are being targeted by their neighbors, who use terror tactics to cause them to move away -- perhaps the reason gypsies are seen as nomads although many actually prefer to settle."
3,A strong effort...,"...to give some definition to a mysterious ethnic group. Fonseca offers rich details of Gypsy life, culled from numerous visits with European Roma in the early 1990s. Her writing sometimes gets a little thick and scholarly, but it's worth muddling through, especially if this is a particular area of interest."
5,culture,This is the only book I have found on Gypsy culture. Very readable and full of informationa fried of mine who come from the area said it describes the area correctly. If you are intested in different cultures this is a must read
1,Sladerous book,"Reading this book I had a sensation that can be well described by the words of the author when she stumbled on a pair of bare-assed middle-aged man in Warsaw. ""I leapt back, stupidly gasping eek like I'd come upon a large rat""."
3,"A good , but not scintillating , first person account .","Look. The book was ok and certainly Fonseca's foresaking the comforts of Western life to research the book commands respect, but it is a bit of a slog to finish and the prose could use considerable trimming. I love this customer comment service but the customers don't seem to get it: they write reviews that ape the stuff you read on dust jackets instead of saying what they actually think about the book.They keep submitting comments laced with words like ""majesterial"",""lyrical"", or the ever-popular, ""insightful."" Are these readers afraid that if they honestly say that the book, though earnest, dragged and could have used an astringest Strunkian edit, that they will have deprecated the subect itself? This service should be an explosion of democratic opinions--not a Louis Laphim impersonation contest. A little more candor is in order people!"
5,Marvellously well-written and researched,"Ms. Fonseca has done a masterful job of researching and explaining the dynamics and the texture of the life of the Romani in the context of the changing Eastern European realities. She blends dispassionate objectivity with warmth and fondness to provide a warm, vibrant picture of the pain and joy of the long journey of the Gypsies. This book will set a standard for ethnography works intended for the general public."
4,Wonderful book!,"This book is one of the best modern overviews of gypsies today, dealing with trials and troubles. The author deals with the situation of the Roma in post-Communist Eastern Europe with a slightly biased eye, but if you take some things with a grain of salt, this book is a wonderful read and you might learn something too!"
1,Very disappointing,"The title of this book suggests that it offers more than it delivers. Ms. Fonseca's book is based on her personal experiences living with several impoverished Albanian Roma families. I thought the scope of this book was far too narrow to be of general interest and far too narrow to be the basis for any sort of political or anthropological conclusions. If you are looking for a history of the Gypsies and discussion of Gypsy cultural contributions (as I was), I suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Nice Tag Holder,The brass is sharp looking and the plastic cover insert protects the license plate well. It's a nice addition to the back of my Prius.
4,Good product - Fairly Brassy Appearance,"This appears to be well made, although the plastic cover is slightly prone to cracking at the edge if you are not careful. Also a fairly brassy appearance, and I usually like polished brass as a finish. My car has chrome finish and I wonder if perhaps a gold finish might have been better. Also screw caps are a bit tricky to fit snugly so they don't fall off."
2,size of screen is the only thing good about this gps,"this gps is slow to load when you can get it to load, screen is super large and clear states it has games but only has 1 game fm transmiter dose not work or this may be just this unit this the 3rd. one of this model i have bought and is the only one i got to work at all the video in is good but is very sensitive to type of media you run works with my alpine in dash dvd.all in all i dont suggest this gps too many cons. and not very many pros."
2,Did not meet expectations,"I wish I could recommend this item, but I can't. I spent many hours playing with it when it first arrived - I even called tech support a number of times. In short, here's what I didn't like:1) The box is very picky about the SD media used. Only certain brands with high speed capability would work.2) The box is very picky about the video formats it would play. Basically, wma is all I could get to work. divx is supposed to work, but alas, I was disappointed here. Load a high res movie in and the word SLOW does not begin to describe the performance.3) The box is very picky about the audio formats it would play.4) Picky about image files too.Here's what I liked:1) I could plug in an external video player in it and it would play it great."
5,Great GPS,"Some of the cons are bad user manual. It says charge the unit even though there is no internal battery. It has USB ports but no usb cable. There is charger for car but no power adapter if you need to take it home or so. I wish it came with at least those 2 accessories when you are paying 500 for this baby.However, the gps itself is really great. Inserted the sd card, plugged in the car charger and the unit was ON. It picked up signal immediately. 7 in screen is really great. Tried few addresses and got voice guided directions immediately. Even tried nearest gas station which worked nice. Took some wrong turns and it recalcuated new route instantly.I think it would be a great buy if you are looking nice GPS. I haven't exercised other features such as mp3 or video but I am really not intersted in them."
5,An Excellent Product!,"I honestly do not know how this GPS could receive so many negative reviews! My husband and I bought the Plenio (we call it Plee Plee :) ) in January of 08. We used it constantly and traveled from Washington State to North Carolina using it.It is not perfect. It will not do your dishes, change dirty diapers or fill up your tank, but for finding where you need to go without printing off directions from mapquest its wonderful. It has big ""buttons"" on the touch screen, a video option for the kids, games, and accurate directions. We never had any problems.Our Plenio was stolen out of our car in September and I fully intend to by the same one as a replacement.Bottom line: If you want a GPS that will do your daily chores and find you your soul mate....this isn't it. But if you want a GPS that will get you where you are going, you can't find a better one."
3,Faulty Navigation Prompts Cripple Promising GPS,"Plenio VXA-3000 GPS NavigatorThis BIG screen GPS could be the greatest. I just bought it and used it to drive from Washington DC area to NYC area via Delaware Bridge and NJ Turnpike and back. It gave numerous weird and some incorrect prompts. It would say things like ""Stay Left and Change The Highway"" when passing an exit ramp for example. Several times it gave instructions to Stay Right and Exit The Highway at times which would have taken us WAY off route. The fact that instructions were difficult to understand and often incorrect limits greatly this GPS. You need to take along a MapQuest and follow signs VERY carefully if you want to USE the VXA-3000 as you cannot trust it totally. I hope they release a replacement mapping system with understandable prompts. The SEVEN INCH SCREEN is fantastic. This could be the TOP PRODUCT if they would fix the software that makes it tick and is supposed to fulfill its purpose."
1,unit did not access GPS signal,I returned the Pleneo VXA 3000 GPS after fooling with it for several hours trying to get it to work. The irrelevant game features worked fine but it wouldn't access the GPS signal. The bright spot though is the excellent return policy of Amazon... a quick refund including S&H and insurance. I then went with a Garmin c240 Street Pilot and have had no problems with it. L
5,Plenio VXA-3000,"The gal friend and I bought two of these units, a couple of months ago... They are working far better than we expected, because of a couple of negative reviews.. Love all the ""extra"" features... It will play a full length movie, if you will use a separate 2 gig SD card, convert to 320X240 AVI format.. Slideshow(different from photos) is a little pricky.. The photos MUST be 480X234 format and started from the MAIN menu.. Strange, but works well... Remote Video input works fine, too.. Gal friend can watch her horses in the trailer, with the addition of a remote camera.. Oh yes, it does GPS, also... Two voices... The year old maps and POI are just fine.. Really, how often do the maps change?.. Before GPS, I used 10 year old maps from somewhere stuffed in the glove compartment... Hmmm, I wonder what that USB plug on the side of the unit is for???"
1,Love's Unfolding Dream,"To say this was a farce is putting it mildly. I ordered the DVD for this movie and Amazon sent me the book, then had the nerve to say I ordered the book, which is a great big lie !!!! Then to return it they make a person print off the return label which is postage paid, then they take it off your credit card refund. They charge you a bundle for it. It only cost under $2.00 which they charged then $3 something for their label. I could have returned it for a lot less on my own. All they do is make money off people like us. They really need to fix their website that if we order a DVD that is what we get. What a joke !!!!!"
4,DELIGHTFUL!,"While some of Oke's books were better, this one is still very good. This book is more of a lessons of life type. It shows exactly how each and every teenage female has felt at one point or another. It brings to fore the fact that we all know that life is not always some picnic, but that everything turns out for the best in the end."
3,A decent selection of songs from Cowboy Bebop,"This has a decent selection of songs from the Cowboy Bebop anime. I recognized a couple of songs from Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (""Cosmic Dare (Pretty With a Pistol)"" and ""Gotta Knock a Little Harder""). I know I also recognized one of the songs appearing in an episode (""Mushroom Hunting"" came from the episode, ""Mushroom Samba"").This disc was sequenced in such a way that most of the up-tempo numbers appeared during the first half of the disc, and most of the mid-tempos and ballads appeared on the second half. Unfortunately, this kind of track sequencing makes it hard to listen to the disc all the way through (by the time I hit the last three songs, I was starting to fall asleep).There's a good selection of music here, but it's probably best not to listen to this CD straight through. You're porbably better off either programming the songs in a different order, or have your CD player randomly choose the order in which the songs are played."
5,"GREAT, FANTASTIC INSTRUCTIONS especially for beginners","This video is fantastic. You won't sweat like crazy but when done you feel that you've had a workout. Instructions are step by step so that you get it, video set looks fine, you can hear the music and can hear her instruction well also. I would recommend it certainly."
5,Great for begginers,"Wasnt as fancy as I was hoping for as an intermediate dancer, but it was a great step by step breakdown of a few nice routines for ppl just starting out."
1,Waste of money,The video was absolutely horrible. It was not a work out at all Didn't raise my heart rate at all nor was it sensual. It was a complete waste of money! Dont buy it!
3,it's okay,"It's okay. I think the title is misleading. It's definitely very sexy. Dance? what do i know. she is mostly walking around sexy, and then stretching around on a chair or on the floor like a kitty cat and then rubbing her legs in the air. Not bad. very nice, actually. However, to me that's not really dancing. It's also no way definitely not a workout. a nice little walk around and stretching routine. so okay. I got Sexy Moves for the Club dvd, and to me, That one is an exotic dance workout. much better. I recommend it. This one is nice, too, but it's too slow and easy to be much more than a stretching routine."
3,exotic dance workout,Nice instruction but won't work up a sweat. Instructor seems a bit stiff. O.k. for what it is.
2,Not exactly a workout,"To call this DVD a 'workout' is a misnomer. It is more of an instructional video for learning a fairly short exotic-style dance routine. If you are new to exercising you might find it a little toning, but if you are already fit or regularly work out, you won't even break a sweat, just add a few sensual moves to your repetoire. Quite often the instructor has you turnng around and moving away from the TV; it's awfully hard to visually learn something when you have your back to it. There were some fun elements in doing this routine, but a workout it is not."
3,dance,a little to advance for me. some dancing skill would probably make this tape a+..but i dance like a sloth..i found myself being clumsey and almost falling trying to follow the moves and i was barefoot the whole time!
1,"Cheap construction, slides off after 5 minutes","I bought a double-pack, hoping it would keep my cell phone and ipod touch on the dash but even though the car was spotless, it didn't work on anything but a perfectly flat surface (e.g., it never worked).I've tried other non-slip pads that worked far better but thought this was a more elegant design.Lesson learned."
1,Drymouth,"Reading this book is like eating a bowl of Grapenuts w/o milk. It's like dropping ones clothes off at the cleaners only to hear the clerk say ""Sorry, we have no chemicals with which to clean your garments."" This farce is Cookman's second endeavor & sorry to say, it is worse than his first attempt at ""MegaAuthorDom."" His ""historical prose"" only lends to the lack of page-turning ""joie de vivre"" most readers experience when settling down with a ""supposed good read."" Mr. Cookman should revisit his New York roots before attempting such a wayward endeavor, regardless of Mark Rodgers' ministrations on the lack of welfare aid in the State of Ohio."
2,stumbling journey of a spoiled aesthete,"This is the story of a callow boy, destined for an elite education, who passes some time with a faded, decadent uncle. They sit around talking, he is introduced to sex, and fears for his financial missteps. The most memorable scene is a heart attack, with its sudden fear of death. The philosophical discussions, for me personally, are utterly flat and lifeless, a waste of time unless you have never read any philosophy or even non-fiction. As such, this is a badly failed ""idea novel"" with little action and lots of shallow sentiment, the characters being mere vehicles for obscure ideas. I do not mean to argue that ideas are not worthy to be pursued, but this novel is not the place to do it. It is a boring read, for high brow afficianados who feel they are ""up to"" it intellectually.Not recommended."
2,Poorly written. Boring.,"I think this book is poorly written. The authors go a long way describing all kinds of taxonomies (look at the abundance of 3d diagrams such as Figure 4.11) without letting the user grasp the major ideas. Just check the discussion on the 10 types of distributed databases in chapter 4.They also spend a lot of time and paper describing relatively simple concept without actually making the concepts any clearer. Some concepts never get defined so it's not clear why they had to be mentioned, check 13.4.2 and try to figure out what the convoy effect is.I think the main problem of this book is that it tries to please to wide an audience: undergrad students, database researchers, and practitioners. I don't think the book is of much value for any of these categories of people."
4,"Good DDBS book, but needs updating","This book was chosen as the main text for a distributed database systems graduate Computer Science course I recently took. For a CS course on the subject, it is an obvious pick since not many related texts exist on the market. The text is good, but needs updating since it was published in 1999. Research papers from IEEE and ACM were relied on as supplementary reading, since research in DDBS continues, and much has been written in the last four years."
2,"Poorly described material, too many mistakes!","I just got my hands on this book for my master program study. From just reading a couple of chapters, I can see where this book is going. It is clear that the book was published in a rush, and never reviewed properly. The author takes too much time struggling to explain the theory, and when it comes to the example, author simply tells that its obvious, although the theory behind is explained in at least 3 pages. Also, the amount of mistakes I found in this short period is enormous and unbarebale. You start to get lost when following the example and feel you can move forward.My advise for you, if you are not obliged to buy this book, then don't do so, specially if you look at the price of it."
5,Adam creates another great CD.,I wish he came out with more CD's. But you have to grab what you can. Being a player with Miles you can hear his influences in a very positive way.
5,FINALY SOMEONE WHO CAN REALLY SANG!!,"Syleena Johnson is truely a person of vocal talent. Through her songs you can feel the power of her voice and her songs tell stories the goods and bads of real love, none of that little teen puppy love that so many of today's artists sing about. Her CD is one of the few CDs that i can listen to traight through. Most other CDs have at most about 5 tracks that are good but this CD has deep songs of love experiences, not just sex. And I just saw her in concert and the girl can blow, she is truely a songstress with the voice to back it up and her album proves it."
4,"Rocks almost as hard, not quite as funny.","I'm afraid that like Har Mar Superstar, a trip to the UK has Electric Six taking themselves a little too seriously. It rocks pretty hard, and it's funny, but not the equal of Fire."
2,can be misleading,"Be aware that the Star Wars Attacktix Figures 3-Pak is part of a game set and the figures you receive are not necessarily those pictured. It's a random selection. I wish the description had indicated that, we ordered them to get the figures in the picture and my son was disappointed when the package we received was not the same. I wasn't aware of the game, we were just looking for action figures. I have no problem with the toy or the value, but I think that it should be clearer that you do not control which figures you get."
3,Star Wars Attacktix Better For Older Children,Although this toy is rated for the 5+ group I doubt very much if the pieces would handle the wear/tear stress test of a 5/6 yr. old. My boys are 12 and 14 and Darth Vader is already a busted torso. The plastic is cheaply made and although the concept is great the pieces will probably not withstand the test of time.
2,"A few good storys, useless commentary","There are only a few stories in the book, though decent ones. The editor puts in her thoughts after each that would be helpful to you if you were completely inept with relationships. If you enjoy folklore, look somewhere else."
4,jose luis sifontes,"muy buena chaqueta , solo falta que tuviera un forro por dentro, para que cuando haga sol, no sea tan calurosa."
2,Not compatible,"This is sold as a ""frequently sold with"" the V500. They are not compatible. Wasted too much time and energy on this one."
1,Misled By Image,I thought I had read the reviews and the image carefully but I didn't. The presentation leads you to believe the feeder and scanner are one (the image) and for the price it should be. As would be my luck the Epson scanner that this separate piece attaches to is no longer available. I believe Amazon should remove this item completely from their stores or the description should be clearer.
5,Great item!,"I ordered this for a new bathtub installation. It is brass so the quality is very good. Easy install but be careful you place the overflow gasket with thick part ""up"". If installing after placing your tub in its framed out location then have a helper so that they can thread the screws from the inside of tub while you hold the assembly from other side of wall. Most tub manufacturers recommend to install drain assembly before placing tub which is a very wise thing to do."
1,Soo Disappointing,This movie has no kung fu action in it whatsoever!! A guy trying to kick another guy in a brawl does not count! I bought this because I thought it had a lot of kung-fu action...COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT
5,Absolutely Groovegrass,As a line dancer and only hearing some of the pieces being used in the clubs I bought it for that reason. But when I got the CD what an amazement it brings to your ears while listening. If your not into the older bluegrass style this will definetly be a treat. I being from the younger generation thought it was super. Some of my older friends from the bluegrass era ( who are not into hip style music ) thought this was an excellent CD. Buy it today and see for yourself
1,Bad Idea,"If you are considering buying this album, think again. (...) Doc Watson must not have had any idea what he was getting into. I purchased this cd for 3 dollars used and felt I was ripped off. This is the worst album I have heard with the exception of Boy George - Cheapness and Beauty which is far worse."
3,its alright...but,"it has a decent story, great play, great weapons...but, it took a long time to load because of the damn check disc, it would load with sound but not audio, david D couldve done a better job of acting...marilyn manson did a a better job if that says anything, and sometimes the story did get stale."
3,Area 51 Video Game,"I enjoyed a lot of things about this game but it ""crashed"" frequently even though running on a high-end Nvidia card, 3G processor and 1G RAM. I have no idea what was the deal with that. I may try installing it again (for the 3d time)and see what happens this time. It has all the normal goodies a FPS expects except you didn't pilot any aircraft or ground attack vehicles. There's an added bonus of being able to switch into an alien and whack the bad guys. The sniper rifle was pretty useless but the thing that shot blazing balls of energy was effective. It would have been better if they hadn't killed your buddies off early in the game. Overall, OK; price was certainly right. Oh, yes, someone else commented that there's no quick save. That was irritating as well."
1,Area 51,"The best thing about this game is that it starts with the letter ""A"", that way it's near the top of the list when you go to add/remove programs to delete it. I wanted to give it at least 2 stars for effort, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I'm not a big fan of first person shooter games anyway, but this one is pretty awful. The enemy's aim is near perfect and you can get shot hundreds of times, it's cheesy and boring. After going a long way through it there is nothing at all that I can think of that makes this a fun game. The mutation stuff is stupid. The graphics are very good, the sound is fair. It's a very typical game, reminds me a lot of Quake 4 as far as the movement, environment, and all that jazz goes. All in all it's a sad pathetic waste of time."
3,Great FSP except for several frustrating items...,"This FSP is fun to play. The graphics are pretty good and the controls are easy except for the full magnification using the sniper rifle. The visual is too shaky. There are certain difficulties during play as far as fighting the ""enemies"" but I think that makes the game more challenging. The most critical and FRUSTRATING issue is you can play for a long time, then get killed and have to start all the way back to the beginning of the section your playing. There is no F5 save!! Still, it's a fun game but it's no F.E.A.R. or HALO."
2,A new mediocre title from Midway,"I was really looking forward to Area 51, but I was rudely dissapointed by it's bland mediocre singleplayer campiagn with absolutely no replayability. It's fun to play through one time, but not twice. I couldn't even get the multiplayer to work. Trust me, go back and replay Half Life 2 a few more times unless your really aching for something a little different."
3,Tube short.,I had to go to the hardware store to get additional tubing so it would reach bottom of 5GAL bucket.
3,Oldie but Goodie,"Robert L. Brown is one of the pioneers of the rediscovery and the history of Colorado's Ghost Towns. While this book was written in the mid 60's and is woefully out of date as a current guide, it does offer a unique perspective because of it's age. You will find here photos of the way these towns looked at the time the book was originally published. As a student of Colorado history, I find these invaluable. Comparing the current state of these towns to Brown's photos and historical photos of these towns in their heydey allows you to appreciate their fragility and their rate of decline. Don't buy this book as a guide, but buy it for it's historical perspective."
2,Good Idea...Just Not Made Well,My son wanted this for his 5th Birthday and I really liked the idea that it did not take or need batteries. The problem is that the money gets stuck and it falls apart very easy.
1,could have bought contents for $5 dollars,"This would have been so embarrassing to give to any one. I bought this after Halloween,almost 80% off. Its description of chocolate, popcorn and cookies sounded amazing!! I opened up shocked at what I saw they looked way smaller than the picture showed. It did not come with taffy but PALMER peanut butter cups and a small candy corn maybe 25 pieces of it. The second pumpkin tier just had 3 lollipops and orange gumballs. There were no pretzels but a small little bag of caramel popcorn about 2oz. The last tier came with a whole bag of cheap PALMER chocolates and the chocolate chip cookies which are bite sized. I opened the cookies and they did taste pretty good. But I could have easily made a batch of cookies with some extra butter and it would taste the same. So if you want cheap candy and some gumballs, go ahead. Also my largest pumpkin was dented. They are just heavy cardboard.Came with 5.00 off next order but, never going to order from them again!"
5,Facinating Public Health Epic,"An amazing and exciting story of a public health menace of huge scope. An incredible and tragic story of the dishonesty and slowness of the agencies we depend on to preserve and protect public health. Shoemaker's informal and upbeat style kept me turning the pages. I am saddened to see that it was privately published, and therefore does not have the backing of a major publishing house: something this work certainly deserves."
3,Bat Houses,This is a much smaller book than it appeared. But the book is well written. It has several drawings and graphics on house construction. It is an okay book but not a must have.
1,Poor design,My wife used this mop once. She laughed at the useless design. Very small mop head after squeezing out the water. It was also difficult to remove the water. The scrubbing head foam material shed particles on the floor as she mopped.Perhaps the design engineers should mop a few floors before they try to design a product like this. Our Quickie Twist mop now rests in the city dump.I did cut up the handle and recycled the metal and plastic.
1,terrible product!,"This mop is absolutely terrible! The first time I wet it and tried to wring it, the plastic strap holding the mop onto the far end came off, so the mop could not be wrung. It's a tiny little piece of fragile plastic, and it just came off where it connects. I didn't even twist very hard, because I discovered while learning to use it that the other end would slip if twisted too hard. So even when I babied it, it still failed.Then I tried to fix it using a strong cable tie, but gave up after trying to figure out which strands of a steaming wet mop I needed to attach to make the darned thing wring correctly.This mop lasted me about 5 seconds and one tentative wring. I never even got to use it to clean anything. (If you doubt me, go to a store that has one and try wringing it. You'll discover immediately how fragile this thing is.)I can't believe this company sells this piece of junk. The engineer who designed this thing should be fired. Run away!"
1,just say no...,"My experience echo's that of other users...worked well once! The nylon tie that holds it together broke the second time, rendering it completely useless."
1,Terrible!,First try - the plastic zip tie broke when I was wringing out the water halfway through my kitchen floor.Local grocery store told me that they finally stopped carrying it b/c of the frequent returns due to the zip tie breaking.Seems that the company isn't listening to its comsumers. Hate to think I was taken advantage of...
2,Quickie Pro Cott twist Mop,"We purchased the Quickie Twist Mop at the request of the woman who cleans for us. We live in rural VT. The hardware store that carries the brand did not have the particular item in stock, but offered to order it. Instead, I went online. It was an $11 productthat I paid $9 to ship. Then, due to the company policies of inspection/warehouse timing we received the mop 3 weeks after placing the order! Seemed too difficult for something so simple."
4,Nice variety,Not our favorite book but nice variety. Good for a few laughs. In retrospect wish I had kept it as a library book instead of an our book.
3,BoxWave Capacitive iPad Styra,"The pen is well made and is a pleasure to use. However it's not very useful as a stylus. The touch screen of my HTC Touch HD2 Leo responds better to a finger, than to the stylus. I can't be sure if it's the deficiency of the stylus or the screen itself, but the fact remains...I've used a stylus for a long time. Getting to use a finger (and leaving smudges on the screen) took a lot of getting used to. There is no precision to the touch interface that I used to enjoy previously. You can't draw a staight line, for a example. You can't use a virtual keyboard with small keys (to keep a large part of the screen free). I was hoping that the stylus will improve on that...But no, the lack of precision remained and added to that are numerous screen 'misses' - when the screen fails to respond to the stylus all together.Whoever thinks that capacitive screens are an improvement on resistive ones has to have his head examined. Give me a resistive screen with a normal stylus any day!"
3,It is a real ink pen,"I thought this would be perfect for clients to use when signing a credit card transaction w/ Square Up, but it is a real ball point ink pen, so not good for what I wanted it for. The opposite end is like the other BoxWaves, so I would recommend them since they have the tether - I would have just left this one in my briefcase otherwise it would be lost!"
4,Good Stylus/Pen,"I have enjoyed using this stylus/pen. The overall usability of this stylus/pen is great because of its dual functionality. It has a solid quality feel to it. The capacitive stylus works great and is easily used on both my iphone and ipad. The pen has a nice feel and writes well but it does tend to skip a little when writing in my journal which has a very smooth paper surface. My only suggestion for the design of the pen would be to allow the pen cap to fit over the back of the pen. As it is, I fear I will lose the cap one of these days since I usually do not have a place to put it. Overall this is a product I would recommend."
5,"Fantastic, but a little bit pricey","It's great. Unlike other styluses... stylae? stylus'? ... anyways, unlike others its surface does feel as though it sticks to the screen as you drag it, and the pen on the other end is quite useful, especially when used in tandem with the Moleskine iPad Case."
2,Its a drag,"The rubber like tip has much to much drag. It started a little dragy and got worse with use. The pen works well. I liked to clip mine to the spine of the apple standard issue case, unfortunately the clip on the boxwave styra is not made to handle bing clipped onto something this thick and broke off after a couple of months of use.The pogo sold in the apple store works much better, but does not have a pen."
5,Great for drawing,"I'll keep it short: this stylus actually works! The tip glides over the screen, unlike the cheapo styli you'll find around. It makes for a much better experience in drawing apps like AutoSketch. That is all."
4,love it!,the styra is SO much more precise than my finger. it also keeps my screen free from finger prints. the pen works only sporadically (the reason i didn't give it 5 stars). I'm hoping a new ink refill will sort that out. this is a really good product - i'm ordering another one for my husband today!
2,It marks but.....,"..the stylus is like all of them, none are capable to make a definitive line between point and pad. Plus, all of the pens are like writing with a bulky marker-- even with the smallest brush or pencil size. In order for me to use a stylus for art on the ipad, I need a precise point. Someone should make a more durable one using the amateurish (?) principle of capacitive health bar wrappers and paper points on a ballpoint pen shaft (see Utube designers)."
2,Disappointed,"The Boxwave Styra stylus is exactly what I needed for my iPad. However, the capacitive stylus doesn't last. I expected the quality to last beyond a couple months of daily use. But, it didn't. The Boxwave representative with whom I corresponded told me that their product was defective and should have lasted more than 2-3 months. When I asked if I could return it for an exchange, they said I would have to work with Amazon because I bought it through Amazon. I didn't have the required original receipt, so I didn't return the defective product.There are so many other choices out there, don't waste your money on a stylus that lasts 2-3 months. Get one that's cheaper from another manufacturer - one who has a satisfaction guarantee and who stands by their product."
3,Construction Needs Improvement,"This stylus works as well as you can expect given device limitations, being the lack of pressure sensitivity. I used this one with an iPad and thought the pen was a great idea; however, after just a few weeks, the cap came lose and now the stylus won't stay capped. I couldn't really figure out what was keeping it capped in the first place. I ended up having to use tape to keep the cap on and now the pen feature is useless and the tape is annoying. Needless to say, I'm disappointed. For all the functionality, which isn't anything spectacular, the quality of the construction leaves much to be desired."
4,Boxwave Capacitive iPad,"Excellent product. Very useful for iPad, mobile phone (I use Android)and like the pen application. Only reason I gave a 4 instead of 5 is I wish it had the clip to put in the audio jack hole for storage."
4,"Excellent stylus, worried about losing pen cap","I think Boxwave makes the best stylus. This is a quality Boxwave product. I'm worried about losing the pen cap. It doesn't snap on very firmly. I would recommend using a twist pen type of stylus. I bought a different, relatively inexpensive one - the rubber tip isn't as good."
4,iPad pen & pointer,"Perfect pen and pointer (soft rubber tip) for use with iPad.No more wiping and cleaning of the iPad screenface! Would prefer to have the removable cap able to ""clip"" onto the rubber cap end when using as a pen, but otherwise perfect. I will be buying a spare and ink cartridges - this is perfect for me."
5,BoxWave iPad pen,"Excellent pen, works with the iPad extremly well, with this and penulate writing pad I don't carry paper around any longer, being a realtor this does everything needed. It is small enough to put in your pocket or shirt and have it ready when needed for the pad or signature on paper."
1,Don't buy the version with the pen,"Design matters to me. BoxWave overlooked something so basic with this product, it makes me want to smack myself in the head: When you remove the cap from the pen, you cannot put it on the other end of the device. The capacitive stylus is just barely too wide to accomodate the pen cap.(How could this have gone unnoticed? If it was noticed and BoxWave thought it wouldn't matter, that's even worse.)I am certain that this pen cap will either get lost, or (more likely) I'll simply never use the pen side. (It doesn't write particularly well in the first place.)My advice, skip this more expensive version and go with a single-purpose stylus.In fairness, the stylus end of the product does work as advertised."
2,Clip fell of after 2 Days,"I bought this so I could use it as a stylus and a pen that I could carry in my shirt pocket. As a stylus it worked fine, but as a pen it failed. The clip fell off after 2 days and no matter how I tried to fix it back on, it just kept falling off until now I've just given up. As far as writing, it was just average.Regret buying this along with 6 pen refills. Now looking for a better stylus pen.Not recommended."
3,"Nice Pen, OK Stylus for iPad","I like the idea of this and the size and compact stylus head. I'm afraid I'm going to lose the cap (it's come off a few times) and sometimes the iPad doesn't recognize my gestures with the stylus. Overall I like the product, but if something more responsive comes out I'll probably go with it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This,"I really liked the Boxwave stylus when I first got it. Unfortunately, the tip wore out after about two months. When I inquired about replacement tips, the Customer Service folks at Boxwave suggested that I just buy a new stylus, at a cost of about $25.00, since they don't offer replacements.Save your money and buy a Targus, which costs about half as much and lasts much longer.The only reason I give it one star is that no stars is not an option."
3,Tip cracked and dragged. Too pricey.,"I used this stylus mainly for art on my ipad. It doesn't require much pressure to work, but the tip tends to wiggle around alot and over time develops cracks which makes the stylus drag on the screen. Lasted about 4-5 months for me under heavy usage. I just dont think its worth the price there asking for some metal and rubber. If you want to take the risk, go on youtube and make your own for free."
4,Great stylus,"I decided to get this stylus after reading through a number of reviews of different brands and I'm very happy with the purchase.The size and weight of the stylus are just right and the rubber tip doesn't feel cheap. It's sturdy and glides easily on my iPad screen. The pen is a nice touch as well and the nice shiny look of the stylus matches my iPad too.This is definitely a good deal for the price and a must have for anyone who plans to do any significant amount of writing on their tablet. It isn't magnetic but due to the nice weight it doesn't roll around or fall off surfaces easily.***It's also really great for playing tap games like I do such as We Rule, Bakery Story, and especially games like the Big Fish hidden object games like Dark Tales - Rue Morgue :D"
4,Great Stylus,"Longer in length than the other products offered. Makes it easier to hold. Would love to see a model that is a little thicker, much like most pens"
3,"Good, but not great...","I purchased this to use with my Acer Iconia A500. It works well, BUT there is one major flaw, what to do with the cap. The pen part works good and the stylus works fine albeit you can't use it for drawing fine lines (it's not designed to), but when you are actually using it as a pen and take the cap off, you can put it on the end of the stylus (it won't fit). So, if you are disorganized or have little people in your house your cap may end up missing...which would not be good. A slight redesign to allow the cap to be stored on the end would be premium!"
4,Concerning the cap on the Boxwave from Amazon,I love this product. But am surprised that no one has mentioned that the cap will not fit right over the stylus end.I have tryed countless times but it just does not.So it is great looking and works well. But has anyone noticed this?It would be nice to be able to put the cap on the other end so you do not lose it.But I have several and that is my only problem with it.Maybe they can fix this?I am so used to putting my cap on top of my pens and it seems this would not be hard to do with these but as I said I have several and none fit over the cushionlike a pen fits on top of a pen when you are writing.So it would be easy to lose the cap if you forgot where you had to sit it for this reason.Anyway I was surprised that no one mentioned this.Otherwise mine have lasted long and served me well.
2,Looks good and works but its only going to be in your life but for a few days...,"I have another stylus that I use regularly but wanted a back up so I bought this one .I was looking forward to having the ability to use a pen as well and thought this would be well suited.Well- it works and it looks fine BUT(and I don't know what the designers were thinking-or NOT thinking) in that when you take the cap off to use the pen end, there is no way to put cap on stylus end (like a regular type of pen would have the ability to do). What will end up happening is that you will have to place it on table, pocket ....somewhere other than where it is easily 'find-able' or won't roll away....and if you are in a situation where you are standing and taking notes or walking around or having to move from seat to another place....you WILL lose the cap, which contains the stylus end of the device....so you are left w/ just a ball point pen w/ no lid....dumb design."
1,MISLEADING DESCRIPTION OF PEN POINT,"I've searched everywhere for a stylus that has the design of this one, but that would have ---INSTEAD OF A PEN FOR PAPER --- a fine point for doing detailed art work on the iPhone 4s because most of the people designing painting apps and some of the other apps have NO FREAKING CLUE AS TO WHAT AN ARTIST REQUIRES OF A STYLUS... which is to say, NOT always a FAT BUBBLE ""point.""Where are all of you ""geniuses"" at and what are you doing with your time??? Evidently, spending too much of it at Starbuck's!"
5,Works great,"Sometimes, at oblique angles, it doesn't pick up perfectly, but the added dexterity over using your finger is well worth it. Also, it doesn't leave finger stains like your hands do, which makes it easy to watch videos without having to clean your screen off every time you pause it."
4,Handy!,"Making a stylus that also functions as a pen is a great idea! Now I don't have to carry both in my pocket and look geeky. One suggestion that I would like to make is that the pen cap be able to fit on the other end when writing, just like most pens with a cap. I am concerned about losing the cap and then the clip for the pocket is gone too. A small design change would make this a great product!"
2,There are cheaper Stylus that work just as well,"The pen feature is neat, but after 6 months, the ball dried out and it writes poorly now. I bought a replacement stylus at Amazon for 9 dollars that works fine.Update. I reached out to Boxwave, who told me too bad, the pen has a 30 day warranty. What crap."
3,Good but not Great,"At first I was extremely excited to receive and use the stylus, but after time the overall effectiveness of the BoxWave Styra seemed to decline. The pen as an added feature was nice, but had below average quality. I would have much rather preferred the stylus that connects to the iPad, because I had a hard time keeping up with the accessory. As I did more research, I found a few local computer stores that carried similar stylus for less the cost and no shipping and handling fees."
3,"Probably the best available, but could be better","There is a real dearth in the market for a decent stylus/pen for the iPad. The pen works fine, the rubber tip provides reasonable responsiveness, but the cap can be easily lost and the pen is too thin for my taste. I use this product on a daily basis, but don't expect to be blown away by its functionality."
4,Get Up and Get Down,"This is a band from Oakland who embrace the sound of New Wave. All their songs are catchy. It's fun music. There has been a lot of depression in my own life, so this is the music that I thirst for. I want to dance. I have always been a good dancer. I used to ask every girl to dance with me in junior high. I was a famous once. I feel famous again when dancing to Communiqué. I feel famous for fifteen people. This is a band that could sell out one day, and become really famous, and party with Paris Hilton. That is really the goal of all music today. By the second album, it should be happening. Maybe they need a good publicist or manager. Then Communique would be a household word. Kids would turn off their Playstations and listen to this fine band."
3,please step away from communique,"um...why dont all of you scene POS go buy Franz Ferdinand's new cd or hey how about the Killers...oh and lets not forget the Shins...how the hell can you compare this band to them......please put the cd back in its case and kindly return it to your nearest indie distro...this is serious...this band is you either love or hate personally i love it but i have my reasons.....and those i will stick to.....these guys changed my life back in oh 1999...please for the love of god dont let this band be another comparison to your square ass retro chorus ridden staccatio laden fag rock this is serious music written by a man with talent so Fa Coff..""i never looked at you with hateful eyesi never held you in angry arms"""
2,Review,"This book is very short and is written poorly in a summary. It does not tell important things that happen. It has no Jimminy Cricket, no going to school, and Pinocchio finds Geppetto by accident which is not so. He is supposed to get a note telling where Geppetto is and Pinocchio is supposed to go to him. This book is not written very well. Take my advice. It's a third graders point of view. I don't recommend this book and I don't think any other third grader will."
1,Thumbs Down!,"Sorry to be destorying Carlo Collodi's famous book, but Disney has won me over. No major violence is softened in the 1883 Collodi version. The cricket is intensionly killed. Geppetto is a JERK in the oringnal beginning. I do not advise ""Pinocchio"" unless it's Disney."
4,I actually enjoyed it...,To be honest I thought I was going to hate this book. Vikings did not interest me in the least so I thought I was going to be bored out of my mind. Although Vikings are not appealing this book kept my interest. I hate the Vikings barbaric ways but since I know in my head that it was truly the way of things I overlooked the treatment of slaves & the women & tried to focus on the main characters & how their romance developed. If you can go out of the norm & try something different then this is a perfect book to do that with. I truly enjoyed it.
4,LOVED IT!! HATED IT!!,"Loved the book but hated certain parts. First, the hero, Thorne was a complete idiot. Fiona was a great heroine, although there were times I wanted to reach into the book and shake some sense into her. His father and brother were just as dumb as our hero. Everyone in the village kept screaming that she was a witch and these dummies were the leaders of the chant. The villians, Bretta and Rolo, were just plain horrible. I did find myself cheering for our loverbirds throughout the book but it was a bit tiring reading the back and forth, he loves her, he loves her not. That being said, buy the book. You will want to throw it across the room ( I actually did several times) but it was worth it."
2,"Good storyline, not so good writing","I think Ms. Mason's storyline and setting are exciting and the plot has a lot of ups and downs, but the writing itself is not so exciting, nor is it very good overall. I've read tons of great books, but I could never really put into words what made them so great. In this instance, I can plainly see why this book didn't do it for me. I think the main reason why I didn't like her writing style is because she just lays it all out on the table, without adding subtlety or taking her time on really important scenes. Some sections are even embarrassing in their cheesiness (i.e. the last line of the book). I've never written a review before, and I don't like to put people down (obviously my writing skills aren't fabulous) but I would hope Ms. Mason would take this as constructive criticism and maybe work on her craft, and readers would take this as a helpful guide when deciding whether or not to purchase the book."
1,Waste of time.,"I hated the characters, all of them. The back and forth saga of love/hate and love/hate between the hero and heroine got boring. I didn't believe anyone would love the Hero, he was one of the worst jerks I've read about. He and the Marqui de Sade should get together some time. The writing is simple and the story unsympathetic. Don't bother. Read Dream of Me by Josie Litton instead."
1,Were the other reviewers reading the same book???,"I am still kicking myself for spending good money for this book. This is the first Connie Mason book I've read and will be the last. Mason tells the story...literally. There were times that I laughed out loud at some of the more intense moments when the characters are recognizing their own glowing physical attributes and sharing with us. I'm sure that Mason never intended to give this perception, but sadly that's the way it came across to this reader. Over and over and over again. The editor needs a serious reprimand for allowing this book to ever be put into print. We've all heard that the publishing industry is a beast, that it is next to impossible to get published. Connie Mason proves them all wrong."
2,High School Textbook - Not Great,"The newer edition (presumably revised, not just with new chapters) with Samuel Bryant might be better than the one I own, but my 1958 edition of the Rise of the American Nation is not one of my favorites. This was the textbook I had to read in 1972 as a High School senior in South Boston. I think it is overly patriotic, and I am a conservative. My edition only has Todd and Curti as authors. I have read a lot of history textbooks and this is way below average. Its chief value is instructing the reader on how America's students were being instructed back in the day."
5,Couldn't wait to turn the next page.,"This is a fictionalized account of the Green River killings which took place in the Pacific Northwest in the 1980's. The protaganist is a Seattle police detective who early-on senses who the real killer is but has trouble convincing the task force searching for the killer of his true identity. We get a good peek inside the killer's mind, as his identity is never kept a secret from the reader. From the detective's earliest suspicions up to his final moments with the killer, the pace never slackens. Readers who can't handle sadistic killers should avoid this book"
4,"Compelling and terrifying, puts you in the killer's mind","""River"" is Rod Thorp's best work yet. Based on the truestory of the Green River Killer in Washington State, thenovel takes you into the demented mind of a serial killer.Thorp (The Detective, Die Hard) researched his novel by goingto the same places, driving the same roads, and possiblymeeting the same people as the killer. His insight intowhat makes the killer act as he does makes me wonder if Iwould ever like to meet the author in person. This book isa ""must read"" for any fan of a mystery or a psychologicalthriller - you won't be able to put it down!"
2,Wonderful IF you don't use Windows Vista,"purchased the Magellan explorist XL in Feb. '07. Since then I've been absolutely disappointed. At the time I was running Windows XP Pro at home and loved the GPS USB cord and being able to upload my tracks into Google Earth. Unfortunately I upgraded to Windows Vista Enterprise due to necessity. I have made numerous calls to Magellan about the fact that the GPS isn't compatible with Vista and have always gotten the same non-committal response. ""We'll have drivers in about 2 months."" I call back every two months and get told the same thing by the outsourced, barely understandable customer service. I mean, how hard is it to put together a USB driver? It's not! It's now almost 7 months since Vista was retail released. This unit is wonderful if you are using an OS other than Vista or if you don't mind the constant swapping of a SD Card between the GPS and your computer. If you only use Vista, save yourself the hassle and look for another manufacturer."
4,Multi Disney Princess Rub-On Wall Art,"Looked very nice in my Daughters room. Wish it had come with the applicater. I just used something with a flat end on it. Worked just fine. You do have to rub the decal for a bit, but it looked very nice. Would recommend,Yes! Thanks!"
5,Mary Kay Ash was dynamic in person! Nani Aki Linder Author Trial By Fire A True Story Of Hope,"Mary Kay Ash lived her philosophy of god first, family second, career third. I had the honor of meeting her as a Sales Director with Mary Kay and was priviledged to attend one of her leadership workshops at headquarters in Dallas, Texas. She was a brilliant leader. An inspiring teacher and most of all a woman who walked the talk. Her series of books when read closely reveals a business plan that is bold and forward thinking. It is simple in its application and most of all her plan is doable. I would advise women who want to become consultants with Mary Kay cosmetics to read all of her books. Listen carefully to the plan. Follow the plan, never ever giving up. She used to tell us that ""its always too soon to quit!"" Great book with great advice from a woman who made it to the top and beyond.........."
2,ring,"looks a little antic but it is nice, it would be a nice present to give to a niece. hope she likes it along with other jewerly that I got her"
2,Ring 18 - Swarovski Crystal Stretch Amethyst Ring,"Nice ring for the an inexpensive ring, but one stone was missing. It was not worth returning it as you would pay more for postage than what the ring cost."
1,No Support for Windows XP,"I used to like my Toshiba MEA-110 MP3 player. Sounded good. Small & convenient. The software, Toshiba Audio Manager, was a bit cumbersome, but ok once you got used to it. But now that I have a PC with Windows XP and discover that Toshiba offers no support for XP - no drivers to download, no upgrade for Audio Manager - I'm furious. A call to Toshiba tech support offered little more than a shrugged shoulder. I will likely never by a Toshiba product again, just for this reason. Every other peripheral I own is running nicely with XP because the manufacturer either made new software availalbe for download or because XP just handled it. But not Toshiba! And they don't seem to care. Nobody should buy this product."
1,No drivers for XP; indicative of Toshiba's customer service,"I bought this little MP3 player for its size; it is little longer and wider than a credit card and as thick as a pen. It was fine until I bought a new PC with Windows XP. Now my MP3 palyer is worhtless. Toshiba does not provide new software for XP! If this is any indication, Toshiba doesn't care at all about customers. Avoid them!"
2,Falls apart,This toy falls apart every time you touch it. If you want to sit by the tub and put it pack together every time dora slides down the slide then your child might have fun with it. I personally don't enjoy putting the thing together 20 times in one bath sitting. Maybe you can super glue it together or something. Not worth the money.
2,Have to agree with most,"This product sounds like a great idea, just poorly made. I have already thrown away dora, boots and diego, they got moldy because instead of being soft and squeezable, they are hard and can't squeeze any water out of them."
2,Don't bother...Sorry.,"The only good thing about this toy at our house, is that it is Dora. My 2 year old LOVES Dora. This toy does NOT float well at all. The tree tips over instantly, and the bridge does not hold the two floating pieces together. This was a big waste of money. My daughter does play with the figurines that came with it, but the floating island is now floating everywhere around the house!"
1,Doesn't Float/Falls Apart,"I got this toy twice, once I purchased and the other was a gift. BOTH TIMES this toy did not float or hold together. I ended up pitching the island because i was tired of the screams of frustration from my kids begging me to put it back together. Unless you want to apoxy glue this thing together it is impossible to keep the pieces attached. Secondly it does not float. The toy is design flawed and it takes on water to the point that it becomes lopsided and submerges itself, which also contributes to the toy not holding together. The joy of stagnant bathwater oozing out all over my bathroom when my kids decided to take it out of the tub was enough to make me pitch everything but the dolls."
3,Flawed,"This toy is flawed. And while I don't like to write negative reviews, maybe this will save someone the money I spent on this toy.Here are the problems:1. It doesn't stay together very well. The tree falls off asdoes the bridge holding the two islands together.2. It doesn't float very well. The people easily fill with waterand they are hard making it difficult to squirt the water outof them. This makes them heavy. The island doesn't float welleither.3. You can't squirt the water out of the people because they areharder plastic. This means the germs and mold grows in there.YUCK!The slide is fun and my kids had a ball putting things down the slide. But for the money, there are other, better toys for the bath available."
3,Dora Floating Island bathtub toy,"My 3 year old daughter carli went nuts in the store when she saw this bathtub toy. She does play with it everytime shes in the tub, but I am not happy. Due to the holes in the characters that come with the set its more work for me to have to struggle to get the water out of them after each bath. The last thing us mothers need is more work! My 3 year old does love the toy and because I love her I will keep it and continue to squeeze the water out after each use."
3,Island doesn't float,"My daughter loves Dora and received this gift for a ""Dora-Themed"" 2nd Birthday party. For starters, nothing floats unless the island is completely put together, and it is constantly coming apart and flopping into the water. The characters all float face down and don't sit right on any part of the toy. The tree that fills with water is useless.I gave this toy a 3 because it's cute and colorful, thats about it."
2,Not impressed.....Not worth the effort....,"My 2yr old twins received this toy for their birthday; i also have a 4 yr old son. This toy is so large there is barely enough room for my kids; if one is in at a time it's fine but if more than one child is in the tub this thing is too big. It does not stay together & this frustrates my kids. When they are done I hardly know where to keep all the pieces! I have sinced stashed the island in the linen closet & we play with the Dora, Boots and Diego that came with it. My kids love the characters and they have the Large Dora & Boots 'splash around fun' dolls for the tub - much better and well constructed."
2,Falls apart,"Like the others have said, this thing falls apart when you blink too hard. The bridge connecting the 2 island pieces has to be in place, or the islands topple. The tree also falls out a lot, and the figurines fill with water (yuck). The figurines are made of fairly hard plastic, so it's difficult to squeeze the water out after bathtime. The kids like it, but are constantly asking me to put it back together. I'd look for a more durable bath toy, if that's what you're after."
3,I wouldn't buy it again.,"You need patience for this toy, or time to help your toddler put it together all the time. It comes apart, so you need a organizer to store it in to keep up with the pieces. It's proably better for 5-8 year olds."
3,It's ok but.......,I wouldn't buy again. It doesn't float very well. Boots and Dora don't float up. It doesn't stay together very well.
2,not worth the money.,"My 2 yr old daughter picked this toy out for her 2nd birthday. I thought it would be good because she loves to play in the tub and swimming season was just started it would be great in the little wade pool. What i did not like about the toy is that boots for starters does not float up right like the picture. Boots floats upside down. Deigo, Dora, and boots are too big when in the boat to go under the bridge and when they go down the slide they get stuck in that hole they fall into. THe tree comes apart easily and is more furstration than fun. Someone should have played with this toy in water before putting it on the market.Now my daughter does enjoy playing with the dora,degio and sometimes boots ( who is her favorite) but because he floats upside down she ignores him. THe island is usless. If your kids want to play with dora and the gang buy them with out the island it is cheaper."
2,"Cute idea, but can't keep it together","My daughter likes Dora so I thought this would be a great addition to our bath time play. However, I'm so sick of having to put it back together, I have taken it out of the bathtub. The two little islands do not stay together with the bridge. Very irritating. I wouldn't buy it again if I had a chance to do it over."
4,Dora Bathtime,"My daughter loves it, but she actually plays with some of the figures from her Dora's talking house with it instead of the ones it came with."
2,To the person who told others to stop complaining...,"This IS a review system so that people can see others experiences with a particular item BEFORE buying it. I think you forgot that part. I rely on this and If ppl were not truthful, it totally defeats the purpose."
3,Disappointing,"Meserve is hooked to the analytical treatment of geometry, which in my opinion is the wrong way...Forget about this confusion and adopt Coxeter's SUM : Introduction to Geometry, Projective Geometry, Geometry Revisited, The Real Projective Plane, Non-Euclidean Geometry"
2,Not as advertized.,"I expected this item to work a lot better, especially as most reviews said it was good.I found it little better than having a carborundum stick to sharpen the dart on. The bottom of the cavities are rounded and curved to the outer edge. This means you have to keep the dart off the bottom or it will dull the point. Then you have to twirl the dart round the cavity at various locations up the curve.Save you money, but if there is a sharpener that works the same as a pencil sharpener then go for it."
4,Exactly what it says.,It is a great sharpener that was inexpensive and arrived quickly. It is key to keep your darts sharp in order to minimize bounce outs.
1,Does not fit.,Does not fit the 5 inch intake port of my dust collector which is exactly 5 inches measured with dial calipers. Wasn't even worth returning this item. Went to a sheet metal shop and got exactly a 5 inch to 4 inch reducer.
1,I should have listened to the first reviewer,"You would think a fitting advertised as a 5 inch to 4 inch dust collector fitting would actually fit over a 5 inch fitting. NOT SO. NOT EVEN CLOSE!! I too, went to my local AC/Sheet metal fabricatior and purchased a stout metal 5-4 reducer for $7.00 plus tax. The Woodstock part is not worth sending back to Amazon."

2,Very slow transfers,Installed and worked flawlessly on an XP machine. Unfortunately transfers were 15x slower than a USB2.0 compact flash reader (1MByte/sec vs 15MBytes/sec). May be ok for a person transferring small amounts of data but took me 6 minutes to transfer about 10 RAW images.
5,Compact Flash Adapter,I use this adapter to load designs into my embroidery machines. I needed a third adapter and couldn't believe it when Office Max and Best Buy didn't know what I was talking about. Out of desperation I looked on Amazon and was so happy when I found this card and ordered it. It is just exactly what I needed. Thank you
2,Transcend Compact Flash Reader,"This card reader is 16-bit, not 32-bit. It transfers files very slowly at 1MB per second. Look for a 32-bit card reader instead."
1,very slow transfer speed,I use an 8 GB CF card. The trasfer speed to my computer is extremely slow. It takes 45 min to download pictures with this card vs. 3 min for the exact same amount of data with my dad's 2.0 USB external card reader. I am now buying my own external card reader.
5,Wrong item for me,"There is nothing wrong with item; except I wanted an adapter for a CF type II card. (The type II adapters work for type I cards and type II as well, but not vice-versa.) As you can see, the title of the item clearly states CF I. It is not the fault of the supplier that I ordered the wrong item. WARNING!! If you do a search on Amazon for let say Card adapter for Type II CF (compact flash) your search will yield all kinds of adapters including the ones you DO NOT want. So, be careful. Do an advanced search maybe."
4,Does what it's supposed to.,"No troubles with it functionally. However I purchased this to see if it would be an easy way for me to ""upgrade"" an old powerbook 190's storage space. It turns out that on startup the PB190 automatically ejects any PCMCIA cards which you try to make bootable. So it offers expanded capacity, but doesn't seem to provide a replacement for the internal HD. Oh well."
5,Works perfectly in Honda CRV,"I got this adapter for a 2008 Honda CRV. Having read many reports that the Honda can have pretty significant compatibility issues with some brands/types of adapters, I was very thankful for the other reviews that said it was working for them.And, as claimed, this fit and worked just fine. I bought the Transcend 8 GB CF card (TS8GCF133) to go with it. Honda's limit of 999 objects (files and folders) took up just about 4 GB for me.The transfer rate was extremely slow. It took between 2 and 2.5 hours to copy everything over. Thankfully, it will be pretty rare to have to do that again.Overall, this is a very good choice for a Honda system."
1,Bummed out!,"Godspell is a 5 star musical, don't get me wrong - I was, however, under the impression that this book would have renditions of the new revival musical (as the preview cites ""new transcriptions approved by Stephen Schwartz...). Instead, it is the very same Godspell p/v/g music originally put out in 1971, with the exception of ""Beautiful City"" (which I found on musicnotes.com three months ago). I'm so bummed I can hardly stand it - just spent money on music I already had."
2,Milk Musle taste so much better,I will never buy this again (even though it has more protein than MM) the taste is not worth my compromise.
1,The voice of a community,"I for one would just like to comment on the way that Heiden flaunts his lifestyle through his music as if he were the voice, or true representative of his community. To everyone out there who is not farmiliar with our lifestyle, please know that this is not what it's all about."
1,What a bunch of rubbish!,"As a fellow member of the gay community I am simply flabergasted at Heiden's attempt to capitalize on our sexuality. Time and again he reminds the listener that ""You are Not Alone,"" that he is a ""Kindred Spirit,"" and that ""It Won't Hurt Forever."" People like Heiden give us a bad name. To all my straight friends out there, take it from me: being gay is not about shoving it down your throat."
1,Dissapointed,Apalling is the first word that came to mind when listening to Heiden's album Kindred Spirit. I find it hard to beleive that this album will ever be a success in today's fast moving music world as it lacks any kind of raw talent or feeling.
4,Good collection,"Of course there will be songs that should have ben included (Obvious Child) and ones that should have been included (50 ways). But this has basically the best of Paul. The good songs from Graceland are here and and Hearts and Bones, the hits and outstanding sound/remastering. Half of the bonus disc is really good too."
1,Graceless profiteering,"Just another clumsy but profitable release of Simon's music inwhat is, seemingly, an endless chain of musical rubik's cube. Nietzsche's eternal recurrence made manifest in our lifetime."
5,"All the best, a must for your cd collection","When they say 'collection' they mean it. This cd has everything you could possibly want in a Paul Simon album, and you will be singing along with all the old favorites, and reminiscing about times gone by. No one speaks the ages like Paul Simon--and his 'Boy in the Bubble' is particularly haunting in the current time. Good driving music--take this one along on your next road trip."
4,A MUST READ ME!!!!!!!!!,"The book, A Higher Geometry, takes place in the old days when girls get raised, and taught how to be good house wives and good moms; but, in Anna's case she doesn't want to be a good house wife and have a good career in math.Anna has a boyfriend named Mike. He is like her whole life to her. Anna gets an offer to go to college in Chicago, she is scared to hear what her dad will say about it. She also doesn't know if she wants to go and never see Mike.The author Sharelle B. Moranville really did a great job on combining a math story with a romance story. This book may be a little confusing when it talks about math; but, it is a great story when it gets to Anna's love life. I strongly recommend this book for girls that really like romance stories."
4,A Trip Back in Time,"Having enjoyed Nina for decades, the video tapes allowed me tovisually revisit the past.The quality of the tapes was good,and Nina was Nina. I may have to buy additional additionalcopies."
1,Very old material,"If you're looking for really old and original Nina Simone material - and you're a die-hard fan, then this DVD is probably for you. The material is all black and white and the recording quality is terrible because of the era in which it was taped. The 7 or 8 songs she performs with her band are not very upbeat, either. It was not what I was expecting and was quite disappointed."
4,Good story,Enjoyed the movie ..intriging example of immigrants crossing the Mexican border....and what they go thru...
5,A story that will make you think about your own life...,"I read this book becasue my friend told me I should. She said I would cry, and I did. Ryan White was a remarkable person. He was born with hemophilia and struggled through much of his short life trying to be a normal kid. Ryan was diagnosed with AIDS at age 13. I am 14 years old, and I know what it is like to be a teenager. The trials and tribulations any normal teen goes through, Ryan went through but he did it with his deadly disease. I am amazed at how much strength and courage he and his family all had. When their own hometown turned their backs on the White family, they moved and built up a whole new life with new friends. Wherever Ryan went, his message also followed and the message is this: NEVER give up on your life. Thank you."
5,"Wonderful, easy read, good veiw","I loved this book beause 1) It was written in Ryan's perspective and how he lived. 2) It was easy to read, easy to understand. 3) He was a person my age that had an extraordinary life and how different it was. 4) He's cute."
5,My Own Story,"This book is an inside lookon what it was like to be Ryan White.It is amazing to see what hewent through and how he wastreated. I would deffinetlyreccomend this book to anyone.It is so touching, that it justamazes you what he went through.You think your whole life overafter you've read this.I would deffinetly read it again."
4,R.A.M.O.N.E.S.,"If you want Ramones tunes for Karaoke (like I do), this is the disk to have--quality is really good, studio recording, background vocals and all--also provided vocal track for the timid (that guy ain't as good as me, but he doesn't suck). Hey, Ho, Let's Go!"
5,erykah shows more,"This is a great CD. It's alot like Baduizm but better. The musical talent whether Erykah's or her backup's is advanced and patient; there is real progress on show here. This album makes a perfect follow up to Baduizm, and if you don't have both then drop what you're doing and go buy them- here of course :)"
5,Badu is one bad mama!!,"I am from Dallas, so I have to respect any home-grown talent, that we do have. Her album is the bomb, it may not be as hot as her first CD, but it shows that Erykah has not missed one step. This is one CD that I can actually listen to all the way threw, without skipping songs. All props go to Erykah."
3,A Far Cry from Baduizm,"...Ok, so that may be a good thing or a bad thing. I applaud the chances that Ms. Badu took on this album , but what I enjoyed most about Baduizm was that I could throw the CD on and just float...she just got a little too funky for me this time around.My biggest gripe however, is with the lack of professionality of the cd. Why was it rushed if she took so long to make it? She changed the order of the songs at the last minute (her note tells us). She omitted one song and the radio version of Bag lady isn't even on this. She also left out lyrics because they were ""too late"".All I really wanted was to get what I paid for...I feel let down on two fronts. But Erykah has my respect and for that much I atleast gave her 3 stars."
3,Disappointing,"I waited al long time for Erykah's new album and when it finally happened, I was extremely disappointed. Yes, it's still her style, but no song on this cd captured me like ""on&on"" or ""tyrone"". Actually, this cd sounds like Erykah was trying to bite off from her own self... whatever. The album is ok, but don't expect it to be like her first one or you gonna be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I guess you can never really duplicate a masterpiece. Erica Badu's first CD is still in my cd changer. I guess it will have to stay there because this new CD is not up to the challenge. If I had never heard Jill Scott, I might have thought this CD was good. Badu still needs to work on her clarity and energy. I still have great respect for her work. But, I was disappointed with Mama's Gun. Take the gun, shoot the CD."
4,Mama Gun,"Erykah Badu's new album is a defintive departure from her last album. It took me a little longer to get into this album than her last two but it is still an amazing effort in which she mixes jazz, blues, R&B and soul. i would recomend it to not only her avid fans, but also fans of Jazz and the Blues because her effots to synthesize Jazz, Blues and Hip Hop are indeed impressive."
4,cool hybrid,"well the followup to Erykah's 1997 debut Baduizm is certianly not as engaging as its predecessor, repeated listening would probably bring out its full flavor. Erykah continues exploring the funky and cool hybrid of R&B, soul, jazz and blues. The first single Bag Lady is a wonderful song on emtional baggages and songs like AD2000 really captures attention. Cool!"
5,Erykah is a doll,"You already know that Erykah is eccentric and that is what I love about her, she was not afraid to step out on faith and just do what she felt in her heart. I really love this CD especially for relaxation. After a long hard day you will forget about all sorrows for a minute while you enjoy this CD."
5,A classic,"I have listened to many ablums in my lifetime, but none has struck me as hard or as fast as Mama's Gun. I bought her first CD when it came out, and was not suprised to be buying one again when I bought this one, but I was suprised to love it so much. I started listing to Baduism when I was in the 8th grade, and now in my junior year the maturity of the this CD reaches up there and makes a lastin impression on me. With Song like. ""Green Eyes"", ""Cleva"", and ""Booty"" Who can go wrong?"
5,DIDN'T CHA KNOW!!!!,"This album is slamming. I had to have this cd after hearing my sister's cd. Erykah is all of that. This woman has it all soul, style, beauty, knowledge and she acquires many other things. This song ""Didn't Cha Know"" is like having your favorite drink or having your favorite meal. It is ""SATISFACTION"". I guess this song gives me some inspiration when needed and it also uplifts me. This song makes a lot of sense . I don't know how Erykah came up with this great song but it a must have for me.Whenever I listen to this disc I have to hear ""Didn't cha know"" at least 5 times I love this song."
3,better than average but missing,I Like Erykah Badu.She shows Growth&Challenge in her choices of Material.but this set isn't gonna make Her appear as a Ground-Breaking Artist.more like a safe product.Green eye's is cool.Orange Moon i dig as well.I dug the fact of Her having Great Talents featured on the Album but considering the Hype&time it's been since Her last Album it doesn't match the hype but it has moments.
3,Talk Badu To Me,"Sweet, sexy, sultry... you can almost see the Turbaned One swaying to the beat of the songs on this latest album. Her voice continues to sooth just as it did on Baduizm but now the overall sound comes across a little more refined. Just to keep things interesting, she takes it into the playful arena with the intro to ""Born Again."" When the listener can be educated as well as entertained then you've really got your finger on the universal pulse."
5,What's with all the negativity?,"I own this CD, and everytime I play it I drift off into that zone that only music can take you. The album is full of great tunes. ""Orange Moon"" is my personal favorite... it's the most gorgeous song I've heard in the genre, and the chords the pianist throws in at the end of the tune are worth the price of the album.As for ?uestlove's job on the album, I think he did a fine job. I think the producing fits Badu perfectly... In addition, the last track on the album ""Green Eyes"" shows Badu singing in several different styles and excelling at each one. The track might be 10 minutes long, but it's really 5 songs packed onto one track. I think Badu is getting grief over this album because she actually tries to do a little something different once in a while, instead of doing the same pop-soul over and over..."
5,Didn't Cha Know?,"Artistry is lacking in the music industry. Knowledge, talent, and skillful writing and delivery is missing in the music industry. Music that contains lyrical depth and effective content is rare in the music industry. For this, I thank Erykah for wholely giving back to us what is missing, lacking and rare in today's music. Every song contains a message worthy of sharing, be it personal or socially consciousness. Fluidity is the key here. One song easily transitions into the next, while each individual piece refuses to sound exactly like any one before it. Masterful is ""Mama's Gun"" and masterful is mama's gun. As she explained it, rather than shooting with an actual gun, Mama (Erykah) will hit you with her lyrics."
5,Classic,"Erykah Badu is truly a creative artist. Like the first cd, Baduizm, you can listen to Mama's Gun all the way through and not skip a song. A very soulful and mellow album.... something you can play while you do housework or while youre on a roadtrip. This is a great follow up to her first cd and a definite classic. My favorite tracks are Penitentiary Philosophy, Didnt Cha Know, Kiss Me on my Neck, AD 2000, and Time's a Wastin'...to name a few."
5,Yes Mam',"I'am a huge fan of Erykah Badu. I purchased all of her cd's, especially the single ""Bag Lady"" and ""Southern Gul"" feat Rahzel. I really love her newest release titled ""Mama's Gun"". It gives you the chance to accept her as a musician. Her background vocalist are just completely fabulous, especially N'Dambi. I love her voice. Please don't be discouraged with purchasing the album. One of my favorite tracks are 13---""Times A Wasting"", when she breaks it down towards the end, it's nothing but the truth. That song stays on REPEAT!. However, I still like all the other songs on the album too. When you have the chance, please pick up ""Mama's Gun"". It doesn't matter where Erykah Badu will be in the next 5 or maybe even 10 years, she will always be remembered."
4,"Different, but good!","Some say change is good, others not. I think in the case Ms Badu, it is. Mama's gun may not be like Baduizm, but it still is worth anyones time who is into unconventional R&B and soul and whatnot. This lp is something else, I guess you can compare it to D' Angelou's 2nd lp. Some people were'nt feeling it, but I thought it was pretty good. Not like the first at all, both D and Badu have a more slower, soulful feel to their Sophmore efforts. On her first album she displayed a nice little album with some nice catchy beats and some nice lyrics and hooks to get YOU hooked (I know I was). On this album there is some definite experimentation. And for the most part I like it in Penetetiary Philosophy, and Green Eyes which finishes up the cd nicely. Whether slow or fast this album is for the most part tight."
5,its been 3 years & i cant stop listening to this album,"this is easily one of the best albums i own. i bought this album in 2000 and it has still not made its way out of the rotation in my cd player.. this album will grow on you in a powerful way. i saw erykah in concert in January 2003 in Denver and she is one of the most incredible artists around right now. her on-stage performance was incredible.. the album is different in sound compared to baduizm but it is a welcome change.. while i loved baduizm, her music shows that she (like her music) is evolving. i anxiously await the arrival of worldwide underground (her next cd)"
4,Some Things only require a few words,"If you really want to see the love and depth that Erykah Badu has, simply listen to ""Green Eyes"". It has more depth and emotion than most any song I have ever heard. It is about a recovery from a painful break up (from Outkast's Andre) and is truly beautiful. That song should alone be enough to want to hear the cd. But there are also some other amazing songs including: ""In love with you"", ""AD 2000"", ""Orange Moon"", and ""Times A'wastin"". It isn't perfect but it left me wanting to hear more beautiful work by Ms. Badu, especially if it sounds anywhere as close to as beautiful as ""Green Eyes""."
3,.. A Ho-hum Release,"... Another artist stuck by the sophmore bug?? I wanted this one to be stronger, and was disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I could not help yawning on this release. The singles were the very best of the album and should have been the tone for the whole piece. Instead, it just seems to drags from song to song."
1,I couldn't even listen to the entire album,"I am very disappointed about this album, seeing that I was waiting almost three years for some original work by Ms. Badu. I am all for new styles and experimenting in music, because it is art, but I had expected a little more old school Badu, not the new funk r&b album. If you are expecting songs like Apple Tree, forget about it. And if you think you are going to get the Bag Lady song you hear on the radio, think again. You should buy the single if you want the real version! I am thoroughly disappointed and I wish I could have returned the CD to get my money back. If you do want a good CD with Ms. Badu on it, check out Outkast's newest album, it's phat!"
1,Disappointed,Mama's Gun is not what I expected at all. The long wait for it to hit the stores was not worth it. Mama's Gun will take a while to grow on you. I am trying to take it back to the store or sell it. The Erykah Badu Live CD was the best and I am still playing it. This is one cd that I should have brought black marketed.
1,Bad follow-up,"After the critical and commercial success of Baduism, Erykah's follow up is a big disappointment. It's the same sound but somehow the hooks are gone and the beat is uneven. Her voice tries hard to capture the same spirit of her debut but something got lost along the way. Toss this one out and keep on playing Baduism."
4,Only need to play once to love,"People who say this album needs getting used to are probably troubled more by their own preconceived notions of what Eryka Badu should be doing than the music itself. This is my first E. Badu CD, so I didn't have that problem. For anyone with a deep understanding of jazz, blues and R&B this is for you. I played this album at a party and more than a few people asked about it. If music can bring a diverse group of people together for a moment in time, that's all you need to know."
5,this is grownfolks music,"Ms badu lastest effort is a musical masterpiece. with each new release she has shown that she is an artist that is true to her craft. with the exception of the minor errors in packaging and processing, this cd is a must have."
4,The Nu Du,"It takes about 3 or 4 listens to appreciate Erykah's 3rd effort. The jewels of the entire CD is #11, 'in love with you' a duet with Steve Marley, where the simplicity of the lyrics allows the listener to focus on their vocal textures. #12, contrasting with #11, the original 'bag lady' which allows the listener to focus less on the HYPE background music and focus on the inportance of her words. And finally #14, green eyes, this song in it's 10 minutes take the listener through the many emotions of an ex-lover having someone new in their life. Therea are two reasons she doesnt get the 5 stars she deserves, 1) we got cheated out of 'props to the lonely people' and 2) she changed the playlist. But i forgive her"
5,favorite erykah cd,"i have all of her cd's and this one is my favorite. i love every song on this album. this one for me really speaks to the soul, if you listen closely to the lyrics. favorite track is green eyes."
4,Ms.Badu Is Back,Erykah Badu comes back after a three year absence with a new style.Erykahbegins to reinvent herself and it works.One of the best c.d.'s of the year.She still brings beautiful lyrics and harmonies to our ears.A bright standout from the decade's musical darkness.
5,The Best of Badu,"I have all of Eryka Badu's albums and, while they are all good, if you're only going to get one, get this one. It is by far the best. Skip the first track, but the rest of the album is as good as it gets."
4,Erikah Badu is like an Old Soul...,"Erikah has always been wise and mature beyond her years and this new cd proves it. Unlike most new artists, she uses real musicians instead of synthesizers masquerading as a band. Some of the cuts are a throw-back to ""back in the day"", but that's a good thing. Stand out cuts include ""Green Eyes"", ""Booty"" and ""Orange Moon"". Erikah has definitely topped her first release. She'll be around a long time if she continues the good work."
3,Over-loaded,"3 1/2Undoubtedly Badu had taken the somewhat monotonous but still palpable formula from her breakthrough debut and steered it into what still remains her artistically assured best, but this creative peak was not without its share of over-indulgence, causing a potential masterwork to simply become another neo-soul modern day classic instead."
4,Mama's Gun hits the target,"This is a great album. Full of creativity, jazz, funk, and Eryka's unique ""butterfly"" soul. Definitely worth a listen.The only regret is that it does not contain the radio edit of Bag lady. I wish that she had included this track. It is much more profound than the version on the album. I will definitely have to pick up the single."
4,Erykah is Back,"Erykah Badu is back with her strong lyrics and excellant music. Most people are aware that Erykah has her own style in the music field. Although many new artist are coming out to join in the running, Erykah's music is still different from the rest. Her first song took me by surprise with its rock(heavy metal) feel.Go out and get this CD you will enjoy it. I know that Erykah will be here for a long time, she's just bad like that."
3,Good but 'Baduizm' is still my favorite.,"I finally got my copy of 'Mama's Gun'. (Better late than never!) IMHO it's good and I enjoyed songs like ""Didn't Cha Know"", ""My Life"", ""& On"", ""Booty"", and ""Bag Lady"". But notice I said good, not excellent. Erykah is still as soulful and her voice still shines, but the sparks that I got from 'Baduizm' are not present in this 2nd effort. There are just too many songs that I have to press the skip button on. I'm not sure why, but perhaps I was not expecting all the funk. All in all, I'll say it's a good CD but I definitely know that this sister can do better."
3,"""Bag Lady"" on CD not the ""Bag Lady"" that topped the charts:(","Bought this Cd for the ""Bag Lady"" song. Sad to hear that it was not on the Cd after I paid good money for it. Otherwise, everything else was fine."
2,It's Okay.,I was listening to Eryka Badu's Cd and it's okay. That's about all I can say. It has awesome sound and the music was off the hook. But the VOCALS RUINED the sound. ...The words are unintelligible. She needs to sing with more clarity. I've heard better soul stirring music. She could be a legend--if you could understand what she was saying.
2,"Ok, but not what expected from Ms. Badu!","First Question? What's up with the foul last minute numbering change? Maybe this one will grow on me??? Maybe I'm not deep enough?? I don't know, but I expected more......"
1,Not worth the price,"My daughter is four & loves all things Barbie. Her favorites are the ""princess"" type Barbies. She was very excited to finally get a carriage. I was hesitant to pay $30 but decided it would give her countless hours of fun. That was not the case. As soon as we got it out of the box I could tell it wasn't going to last for long. It looks great but as soon as you touch it parts start to fall off. The horses don't stay attached to the carriage. The gold pieces fall off and won't stay on. My daughter grew tired of having to fix the carriage and horses time and time again. The carriage now sits on the shelf collecting dust. If I had to pick the best part of this item, it would be the horses. They are the only thing that doesn't fall apart. (...) Very surprised & disappointed that ""Barbie"" (Mattel) fell short of the quality standard we are used to having with this line. In the words of my four year old, ""Mommy this isn't very fun! It's always broken!"""
1,"FRUSTRATING, WASTE OF MONEY!!!","I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. It is the biggest piece of junk Barbie has ever made, in my opinion. That's scary, since many Barbie items fall apart. Your child will end up pushing the carriage around without the horses, because there is no way to keep them attached. I have tried many things already, and my last option is going to be to wrap packing tape around the horses in an attempt to get them to stay on the carriage. Everything about this $30 set is cheaply made. What a shame!"
2,Reconsidered my first review,"I wrote a review and was trying to be more positive. After 3 weeks, I have to submit a new one. Our good friends spent $27 on this toy at the store and it's junk now. Every single little piece has fallen or been taken off. If your child has a younger sibling, this is an issue. I know it warns that it's not for under 3, but I still don't expect over 2 dozen little things coming off as easily as they did. At first the carriage was set aside and the horses were played with. Now, not even those are played with. My girls can be rough on their toys, but this is ridiculous. I don't think we've owned a toy made of poorer quality and we've bought some pretty cheap toys so that's saying something. I would not, would NOT recommend wastingyour money on this."
1,Horses wont stay attatched to carriage,"Sorry Barbie fans. This is a disappiontment. The horses just do not stay attached to the carriage at all. The horses are smaller than the standard Barbie horses so they can't share saddles and tack with the other horses in our Barbie collection. Decorative pieces of the carriage fall of regularly. It looks so pretty in the box, but it does no good if the girls can't play with it. As my daughter told me, ""Sell this in the Yard Sale. I never play with it."" I say get the blue Barbie convertable instead."
1,A waste of money!,My daughter wanted everything princess & the pauper this year from Santa. I think the castle and everything else was great but the carriage is the worst toy EVER! We have spent more time reattaching the horses to the carriage and now she doesn't even play with the carriage b/c everytime she does it just falls apart. Do not waste your money on this toy!
4,Very Informative,"I had to read this book for a political science class I was taking over the summer, and I am glad the professor chose this book because I learned a lot about the estate/death tax. This book puts everything into prospective, and explains the pros and cons of the tax. If your interested on how the estate tax works and why we need it read this book."
1,Wow. Nobody liked these.,"There are three of us in the family and we all like citrus foods, key lime cheesecakes, lemon meringue pie, etc. So I thought these would be a winner. But they are like puffballs (I was expecting a flat cookie, like ginger snaps are), coated in powdered sugar, and they have a distressingly papery flavor to them. Like small paper balls coated in lime-flavored sugar.And they were so expensive!But the tin is nice and my son is using it to keep Legos in."
5,"Tart, sweet and delicious","I was looking for a cookie reminiscent of Sunshine's Lemon Coolers. This one is maybe even better. The cookies are super fresh, sweet and tart at the same time and wonderfully crunchy."
5,Very nice sweaters,"I purchased two of these sweaters. My husband loved them and I purchased three more in different colors. Excellent quality & style. Soft, lightweight and great fit. The service was perfect. I received my order in three days."
3,Great Sweater Shame About The Very Expensive Delivery Charge,"I purchased this sweater thinking I had got myself a bargain, however, once I saw how expensive the delivery charge was, it turned a bargain into an OK buy.Putting it into persepective: I bought three sweaters from three different sellers on Amazon, the first charged $2+ change for delivery, the second $6+change for delivery. Jos A Banks charged well over $10 for delivery. I will not be purchasing anything online from Jos A Banks again as I cannot fathom how they can justify the delivery charges!!!!!!Now to the Sweater. It is very smart and I am looking forward to wearing it during the winter. I just hope it lasts to justify the price I paid..."
2,Boring Boring Boring,My daughter loved this toy at first. She played with it alot for the first day but hasnt since. She loves Dora on TV so I'm not sure why she doesnt like this toy.
2,demonic Dora,"I bought this toy for Christmas for my goddaughter. Although she seems to like it I (and her parents) are a bit concerned. We put new batteries in it, and when Dora speaks she sounds like Dora. However when Dora sings...she sounds a little...possessed. A few shades of Linda Blair in the exorcist comes to mind. We tried putting new batteries in and still no change. We are debating as to whether to try a different doll (it was the LAST one at the store) or keep it and live with it. I just hope her head doesn't spin around!"
2,Possessed!,"This Dora doll was bought for my daughter as a gift since she loves Dora. We were thrilled, at first. She sang cute songs in Spanish and said cute little phrases. Then the strangest thing happened. Dora was on the toy shelf and then started talking without anyone even touching it. It started out as just a random phrase here and there, and then it was constant. There is an off switch in the back, but now it's scary for my daughter because she knows you have to touch the doll to make it talk, and why is Dora talking without being touched? There are many other Dora dolls, and I don't suggest buying this one, if you want your child to get sleep!"
4,So cute...Yet so LOUD,"This toy is so cute! The only thing is if when we are in the car and even hit a bump it start talking. It also is very loud. My daughter puts her hands on top of her head everytime it talks. She loves her soft 9"" dora but doesnt seem to be getting into this one. It is very cute though."
2,Very loud and annoying. Doesn't sound like Dora.,"My 23-month-old daughter loves Dora and received this doll as a gift. She likes it OK. My husband and I hate it. I don't think it really sounds like Dora. It's close, but not quite. The head is large (as I guess Dora's is), so it's very top heavy. After two months, the hair is quite an unfixable mess.The doll is SOOOO loud that there is not way my daughter could go to sleep with it. One night, darling daughter was fighting bed time. Her Daddy finally laid her in bed, and she bumped up against Buenas Noches Dora and off Dora and my daughter went. Found out that Buenas Noches Dora can fly quite far when tossed by Daddy though.The doll does have an off switch on the back, but what fun is that? I think there are better products for your Dora fans."
3,Not the ideal doll for bedtime!! Parents be warned!,"Ok, this should be the sweetest little night time dolly, singing a lullabye to your child. HOWEVER - she talks/sings with just the slightest movement - no pressing any body part required!! ugh... it will wake your child up when she gets rolled over on. She does have an on/off switch, thank goodness!! She is cute, but not really a good bedtime toy!!!!!"
2,Not the greatest and VERY loud,I bought this for my 2 year old who loves Dora. She likes it but played with it for about 4 minutes and hasn't played with it since. I put it in bed with her and she hit it in the middle of the night and it scared her to death because it's SO loud. We could here it down the hallway through a closed door it was so loud. I've put it up on a shelf for when she is older. The Star song it plays is much mnore entertaining then the seperate phrases.
3,Just Okay,"It's a cute doll and if your daugther is a Dora fan (which chances are she is) its worth the $20 bucks. However it does begin to get extremely annoying very quickly! Luckily there's an ""off"" switch. As far as it being an educational tool, she just randomly spews out phases."
5,A Superior Introduction to Magic,"I am surprised by how much I like this beginner's guide to performing magic. It is a modest, but very pleasant production. All effects are presented by one talented, low key, and friendly master magician. One young lady serves as an audience, and as the volunteer whenever one is needed. Although the tricks appear to be the same, mundane fare offered in many uncounted beginner magic volumes, upon closer inspection it turns out that every ""trick"" presented here is one to three steps better than what might be expected.I thoroughly enjoyed this instructional DVD, and I learned many useful tips, and techniques that could have taken me years to discover on my own had I not had the editor magician who produced this instructional video working so carefully to teach me only the best effects, and techniques to get me started as a magician.This is a great guide to the budding magician of any age. My highest recommendation.Keith"
5,Grandson Loved it!,My 11 year old Grandson enjoys magic and I sent him this to expand his knowledge. He told me it had some really cool tricks in it that he could do with stuff around the house and enjoyed it very much.
2,"The Legends Collection,The Englebert Humperdinck Collection","The producing of this CD collection was poorly done. There was too much dead air space between several cuts and the volume was inconsistant, making it necessary to adjust the system during some of the songs."
3,"Someone did not know how to spell ""Engelberts"" name","I can't believe that Engelberts name is not spelled correctly on this CD, that also proves that is was not produced at the level an ""Engelbert"" recording should be. I also noticed that the songs had inconsistant levels of sound."
2,Not what I expected,I ordered it because I saw a song that I thought I wanted to hear it wasn't the song wasn't what I expected someone else may love this but I don't
4,Easy on/Easy Off,"I have a home shop with a Jet DC1100 dust collector with a 4 inch flexible hose. Since I don't use it every day and move my power tools around as I need them, I didn't want to go to the time and expense of setting up a permanent ducting system. This connector allows me to easily move the flexible hose from machine to machine as I need to. The only improvment I would make is to add a handle to make moving it a little easier. My way of doing this was to use a spring clamp to attach it to the hose. The clamp handles used to open the spring can also be used as a handle."
4,Grateful to Amazon for publishing this book,I was so thrilled to find this copy of an out-of-print book that lists the genealogy of the Heatwole family. It made a terrific gift for my Heatwole relatives.
2,Not Recommended,Can I get my money back? That was my first thought after reading the first chapter. I hope writing a review will save somebody else some money so they can buy a better book.
2,This book was very disappointing!,"The book seemed, at first, like it would enable me to make my own incense. But, after obtaining all of the necessary ingredients I find that there are gaps missing in the formulas listed in the book. While the book states that certain ingredients are a must, he doesn't actually tell you where to add them or how much to use, etc... Also, there is a lot of ""filler"" to the book (i.e. measurement tables, incomplete listing of many herbs (meaning the desciptions are brief and go by common name, so you may call it X and the book may call it Y). I would recommend NOT buying this book."
4,Cunningham's Companion,"While the actual list of plants and herbs is not as extensive as Cunningham's, I always use this book as a cross-reference. There is additional helpful information such as each herbs own recipe and incredibly valuable tables for increasing / decreasing amounts. The lists of associations are handy for double-checking what feels right to use. I also appreciate the inclusion of scent descriptions which saves a learning the hard way when making incense."
5,book in great shape,We are pleased with the condition of the textbook. It was described accurately in the listing. We are also pleased with the response to our questions by the seller.
5,Traditions & Encounters book,The book I ordered was in excellent condition. I received it in a timely matter and would definately use your service again.
2,Fair,"The book was rated in average condition, and average/poor was more like it. The front pages were all stuck together and there are many chips/gouges in the spine. The worst part is, this book was advertised as having PowerWeb with it. Unfortunately, the front page of the book containing the PowerWeb password was ripped out, and so I cannot use the website for my class. It was a cheaper buy than from the campus bookstore, but not sure if it was worth it."
5,excellent for students of latin!,"These excerpts of the Confessions, as may not immediately be clear from the entry, stand as they were written--in Latin. It is an ideal book for practicing Latin. It contains a glossary in the back with all words used in the text. Also, it contains a fantastic introduction which seeks to equip the reader with all of the necessary syntactical developments that have occurred since the Classical period of Latin which Augustine utilizes."
1,Keep Looking -- Not worth the money spent,"This monitor is awful. I suggest you completely research monitors before purchasing...I wish I did! The static is so annoying. It is so bad that I will turn on the monitor every few minutes to check on the baby...I won't leave in on due to the static. Sorry to complain, but I don't want you wasting your money!!!"
1,Terrible Static!,"Do Not Buy! The statice is terrible. I have it by my bedside to hear my girl at night but the static is so bad that I can't sleep. I can only use the light, so by the time I hear her, it's too late, she's lost it. Spend the money and buy a better one, I'm going to."
1,It's crap...spend your money elsewhere,"I LOVE Fisher-Price, so I thought that I'd be getting my money's worth...boy was I wrong. I should've listened to the other reviewers. The receiver can be right next to the transmitter and you STILL get static. I tried all the suggestions. I tried different channels, made sure it wasn't interfering with other products, etc, etc. I STILL had horrible reception.It even picked up really strange sounds from elsewhere...at night, it sounded like there were CB radios transmitting through it. I can't wait to bring it back to the store.I have the 900mz version for my older child...I'm going to invest the money and get one for our infant too."
2,Too Much Static,"If we ever had another baby we will be buying a new monitor. This monitor is horrible! If we plug it in, there is so much static that I can't hear anything else. If we use batteries, it sucks up too much and we are constantly replacing batteries. The only thing I will give credit to with this is the lights so you can see if the baby is awake if you don't want to hear the sounds. We used that when we had company before."
1,Horrible static!,"We cannot use it anywhere in the house from all the static this thing gives off. We've tried it all too, changing batteries, channels, rooms...nothing helps! I had one back in 1996 and it was wonderful, so I assumed that the new ones would be even better. I'm very disappointed!"
1,Stopped working after 3rd use....,"I was really excited when I bought the monitor. The look and the light level features made me purchace it. BUT that's not as important if the monitor doesn't work. It actually scared the crap out of me b/c the receiver all of a sudden just gave out a loud constant static, which happens if the monitor is off. I knew that the monitor turned off, but I wasn't expecting it to stop working. IT JUST STOPPED WORKING after the 3rd use. I still have hope and gonna exchange it tomorrow. Maybe it's just this one that's defective. I haven't had any interference problem w/ it the 3 times I was using it."
2,You get what you pay for,"The reception on this monitor isn't great, and I'm only using it in a small apartment where the baby is literally one room away and there are no closed doors between us. I didn't mind this too much since it basically suited my needs, but then this week the A/C adapter on the receiver broke. We've only been using it for about two months, and it went from one day working fine to one day needing to wiggle the plug to get it right to now the plug doesn't work at all. I can still run that part on batteries, but for how much I'll now spend on those I wish I'd have just spent more for a better monitor."
1,Don't buy,"I bought this because it was a fisher price product and I usually love fisher price, but this monitor was horrible. All I could hear was static, even when I wasn't that far from my baby's room. Save your money."
1,Do not buy this,"This monitor is great if you use both the transmitter and receiver in the baby's room. You know, like if you need to turn away from your baby in the crib and get a onesie from the dresser on the other side of the room, but you still want to hear what your baby would sound like if it was on the space shuttle... well, then I suppose this crappy monitor might be ok. However, if you actually need a monitor that is useful, this is definitely not the product. Spend 50 bucks and get a real monitor!"
2,Gives feedback but works,"I have a two story house with the nursery upstairs, and a pack-n-play downstairs, so I wanted two monitors systems. I already had the two monitor long range system from fisher price, but now wanted just an inexpenive one for when my baby fell asleep downstairs because I could not hear him from upstairs. This monitor does the job, but does have a good amount of feedback. I am not sure if it is because I have it set up for too long of a distance, or because it was so inexpensive. I can clearly hear if my baby wakes up, but I also have to ignore the humming noise it makes while on. The noise gets louder, the higher I turn up the volume. My higher price monitor does not make any noise while on. I give it 2 stars because it does work, but the feedback is annoying."
1,Static,This monitor worked for awhile and then three of the lights lit up and I couldn't hear my daughter through it over all of the static. I called Fisher Price and they sent me a new one but the same thing happened with the new one after a few weeks.
1,This thing doesn't work,"When i used this piece of junk it did not pick up one sound!! The lights got bigger and static got louder when my duaghter cried, but I could not hear her voice. DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR!! It is a waste of your money!!"
2,Hummm,"If you don't mind a constant humm, this is a great monitor.It picks up sound from baby's room great but that darn humm is so annoying.Every night we play the game of the volume high enough that you can hear the baby, but low enough that the humm doesn't keep us awake.Is it that hard to make a quiet monitor?"
2,Static is too ANNOYING!!!,"My husband and I placed this on our registry and ultimately received it as a gift. Although I like the dual monitors, belt clip and light features, I cannot stand the ANNOYING static!! I've tried everything to lessen the static and nothing seems to work. I've researched other monitors and will be returning this one in the hopes that I can find something with better clarity."
1,Worthless,"I have now had two of these monitors and they have both been equally worthless. The first had a problem with the cord staying plugged into the receiver monitor. The cord would have to be positioned exactly right to get a connection with the monitor. I decided I would get a new one and leave this one at my parents. I saw the same monitor for a few bucks on Craigslist, and bought it, thinking the problem was unique to my monitor (which I also got used). But this monitor had the same problem. In addition, the static is unbearable. I have to have it turned all the way up to hear anything, and then its still difficult to hear over the static. My husband wont let me turn it on because it is so noisy. Do not buy this monitor."
1,Constant Buzzing and Static - Difficult to Hear Baby,"I agree with the above review. We've had this monitor for a year and a half and it's terrible. It always seemed a little noisy but it got increasingly worse as time went on. The buzzing and static got so bad that we could not longer use it in our bedroom because it would keep us up. Luckily by that point my son was sleeping through the night so we could turn t off. Also, we could only use it unplugged for the first month because after that the batteries would drain out really quickly. Then you couldn't tell when the monitor was working or not because there was always just enough battery power to keep the ""on"" light working - but no sound would come through which meant you couldn't hear the baby. Ugh! The only reason we've had it so long is because we got past the point we couldn't return it and I'm too cheap to go out and buy another. We'll deffinitely buy a different brand with the next baby."
1,Ready for static!!!,"I just bought this monitor two weeks ago and it's awful. It worked fine for a few days and then the static came. I switched channels and the other channel was worse. When we would get up and move around the room the static would get louder or softer, depending on where you were you went to in the room. At night the static was so annoying it would keep me up. I would recommend you not buy this product."
1,SAVE YOUR SANITY AND MONEY!!,"This monitor is TERRIBLE!!!! It doesn't even deserve one star, it deserves to have taken one away!!! Channel A is nothing but static and buzzing, I mean, you cannot hear ANYTHING over it!!! No matter where in the house I set either receiver up, it didn't matter.Channel B's static is a bit better, sounds like a transistor radio, and picks up other people's phone conversations....We just got this monitor, but it's packed back up, receipt dug out, and ready to go back to the store.I am so dissapointed in this product that I decided against getting another FP Monitor, but completely changing brands here..Do yourself a favor and safe your time and sanity!!!"
2,Worked for a while...but,"I recieved this monitor in July 2002 when my son was born. It was wonderful. Crystal clear and no static. I could hear the clock on the wall ticking in the nursery it was so sensative. Now 2 1/2 years later, it is STATIC CENTRAL. Maybe it is just old and worn out. But I still feel secure using it to monitor my toddler at night. It is the strangest thing, but when I use the 9v battery, it is clear. But when I use the wall adapter, it is Heinously staticy. It does go through 9v batteries rediculously quickly, so I can't afford to run it on those alone. I will be buying a new one, and one that I would hope has a longer life to it. This is the cheapest one out there, and hey, I guess we get what we pay for! So if you want it to work for only 2 years or so, it will do the job."
2,"Lights are nice, but static is ANNOYING!","I wish this monitor had worked for us. I know some people have had good experiences, but I can not stand the static. Many times, I can hear my baby cry, but nothing is coming through the monitor because the static is so intense. The light up feature is nice, but it's not worth dealing with the poor reception and loud static."
1,terrible,"This monitor is terrible! I was not sure if I wanted to buy another one since our old one worked okay. But, it sucked up 9 volts like you wouldn't believe. I finally decided to buy another and bought this one. It's going back tomorrow and I will buy more 9 volts.The static is UNREAL! We can't even hear the baby!"
1,Not worth it,"I'm not going to write a long review of this monitor, it's horrible sums it up!The buzzing and static was terrible, I ended up buying a entirely different monitor and never once experienced any of the same problems.Save your money."
4,If you like unusual movies.....,This movie was so interesting and diffefent that I've been trying to buy it for two years. Unless your a funeral director you've never seen this machinery.
4,BRAVE SENSUAL THOUGHTFUL SENSITIVE GROUNDBREAKING!,"This is the most brave and sensual work I have ever experienced. And yes I can't believe I'm saying this in all seriousness.It has a haunting gorgeousness. It forces you to push past your own drawn lines-if you're willing (it has a subdued, thoughtful, and natural spirit to it; so force is probably the wrong term.)-and it changes you.Deeply erotic, but never grotesque when you really would expect it to be. Here alone, the director has pulled quite a feat!I had to see this when I first rented it (now I own it)-but I was afraid it would be too disturbing to take. But surprisingly it felt like I was floating through the most spiritual dreamscape, and ultimately the triumphant Sarah McClaughlin music at the end resonated in me. You can watch this!-However if you want the graphics-if you want the bloody, decomposing, murderous take on necrophlia. Check out the Nekromantic series.I can't believe I'm saying this!"
2,the girl likes dead guys....,"I found the idea interesting but the execution lacking. The movie was boring. I didn't find it that shocking considering the other movies we have seen. A girl daydreams of having sex with dead guys, dates a live guy who thinks he needs to die for her to show an interest in him. **Yawn**"
3,kissed,"Written by Barbara Gowdy, and starring Molly Parker, I expected more. It was very predictable."
2,"Good start, but not enough in there...","let me save you the 8.95 it cost me to buy this book. If you know the rules of Omaha, all the book says is the following. bet the nuts, call the nut draw, throw everything else away. you typically need a full house to win high, and can sometimes win with a flush. forget about any low hand worse than 6-high and be careful even with that as you often split the low half.there's simply not enough knowledge in this book to sit even 3-6 at a casino."
3,"if you've played serious poker, skip this one...","this book is definitely for the beginner...i've played other games seriously and found that i had already figured out nearly everything this book mentions...the new information i found would fill less than half a page...omaha is a complex game and mr. nelson barely skims it's twists and turns...the book is very short, 71 pages, and does little with statistical analysis(which i expected in volume) if you've played seriously, or want to, i'd suggest skipping this one..."
1,You could write this book,"Respectfully, this book and its sequal are both hardly worth the paper they're printed on. As others have said, Mr. Nelson barely skims the surface of this rather complex game. He describes a couple of hands he's played (and won - big surprise!) and expects the reader to generalize correct Omaha/8 play from these few examples. There is no systematic discussion of starting hands nor play after the flop, turn, and river, and the reader is left knowing only that Mr. Nelson likes to hear himself talk. Better to use your eight dollars to raise when you have the button than buy this book."
5,Anniversary Gift,"I bought this for my wife. I like to purchase things that are crafted in a way that makes them potential family heirlooms. I think this measures up to that. In a world where digital photos have killed the printed photo, only the best ones make it in mine. I plan on filling it up throughout life and leaving it to my children.The leather is embossed and seems like it will last. The paper quality is superb. It has nothing on the sheets to hold photos, so you will have to get either some sticky stuff or photo corners. Well worth it."
3,Beautiful Book - Limited Use,"While this is a beautiful book, it is not ideal to use as a photo album because it will only hold smaller photos, not 8x10's. It will not lay flush because with several photos inside, the book gets thick and has a gaping open look, which doesn't look good with such an expensive looking book. Also, you must provide your own adhesive to secure the photos - and you can be certain to place the photo in the right spot the first time as moving it can tear the page. All that said, I again state this is a beautiful book. I'm just not sure what I can really use it for but I'm going to try to find a use."
2,Medici Leather Photo Album,"This is a great looking photo album, but I didn't know the sleeves were fixed. I can't add (or remove) pages. I wouldn't have bought it had that been known. But if you're good with that, then this is a VERY nice album."
2,Sent wrong color,"I ordered this album in Green, and I was shipped the Burgundy. I love the actual album; seems like good quality; but I wish the company would have sent me the color I ordered instead of making me go through the return process...such a hassle."
4,Really good book for those seeking change!,"Change your mind and the way you see things... and you change your life!* Now, this book says much more than that, but that's the lowest level of what it offers. That alone is enough to change a man's life.* This book just hit the right notes for me, after years of practicing various spiritual methods and getting distracted with Asian philosophies to match my Asian martial arts practice. One day, I had an insight/ inspiration in the matter... and this book made it all so much clearer for me when I found it about a year later.* It's a shortened version of all the more traditional methods of consciously creating your own reality. It makes ritual more internalized, which means ordinary men/ women can afford it.* I recommend the book. At the least, do like I did... go to your library and borrow it, make copious notes, and take it back. After a couple years or so, you may actually still want to buy it."
4,Un buen diccionario,"El libro de Gilles Poitras es una gran enciclopedia de los elementos culturales japoneses presentes en el anime. Indudablemente, es un libro de referencia para entender los mensajes implícitos presentes en las imágenes de la animación. Por ejemplo, un templo budista es un santuario para ritos funerarios. En tanto, los japoneses, que son politeístas, profesan el budismo para rendir culto funerario y el sintoísmo para su religiosidad de efemérides. En este libro tenemos varios elementos culturales japoneses ordenado por orden alfabético los cuales nos proporcionan un primera mirada al mundo del anime. No obstante, para investigaciones más académicas como una monografía o tesis; recomiendo los textos de Schodt o Kinsella."
3,"Professionalize, please.","The fannish attitude expressed in the book's introduction (""go read a bestseller,"" you inferior being you) almost made me stop reading, as did the lame illos, ""rants"" about topics like breast sizes, etcetera. I was also frustrated by certain entries that told me what an item was and what anime it appeared in, but not what its cultural significance might be. (For instance, the shrub in a certain cartoons was a hydrangea. In the first place, duh. In the second place, what does that hydrangea mean? Anything? Nothing? Does this plant carry the cultural baggage of, say, cherry blossoms/sakura, or is it just set dressing?)All gripes aside, this is a fascinating intro to Japanese culture as well as anime that could benefit from a little professionalizing to take it beyond the fanboy level, since the author obviously knows what he's talking about. I'd definitely supplement this book with Levi's Samurai From Outer Space and/or Napier's Anime: from Akira to Princess Mononoke."
4,Pretty kewl!,This was a really good and informative book. I learned a lot and it even helped me in Japanese class! Too bad the author only took information from his fave artist(Rumiko Takahashi) and didn't delve into other anime. Almost half of those references you'd find in MKR or Sailor Moon. Albeit limited in anime examples still very interesting. ^*^
2,Would have been nicer had it adhered to the title...,"Yes, it's Japanese, and it's Anime, but an Anime companion? Probably not. At best, it's probably ""the Random Japanese Word You Overhear: What's it all about?"" I agree with other reviewers and it's Takahashi Rumiko following is a little excessive. What I mean about adhering to the title is that it would best have been a true Anime companion... start watching Ranma 1/2 (or A-ko, or whatever), pull out your book, turn to the series (or, even better, episode by episode) and it would go into what's japanese about each episode. You see a carp? What's it mean? That whole episode of UY with Kintaro? Who's Kintaro? What's he doing? WHY is it strange. The information is fairly accurate, however, and in it's current form is quite interesting."
4,Gives translations/blurbs of Japanese language and customs,"It's not bad for what it is, which is a concise and playful alphabetical listing of Japanese terms and customs that one might come across in Anime. But the blurbs are all very short, so if you're looking for deep essays on Japanese or Anime culture, look elsewhere. In other words, if you want a scholarly analysis of the Anime art style, portrayal of women, attitude toward sex or violence, etc., this book will NOT be of much value. However, it does have informative blurbs on Japanese holidays, foods, cram school, hygiene, school-girl uniforms, etc. (The better Fansubs out there usually provide crucial cultural information when it is needed, but this book can help to fill in the gaps a little further.) It also has some interesting tidbits on the more peculiar aspects of Anime, such as the preoccupation with panties, nosebleeds, and intergenerational romance. But don't expect anything in the way of real analysis or critique. You won't find it."
2,Okay for an overview,"This is a most helpful title, now the only one of its kind. Any parent looking for guidance would do well to start here. But the variations in school law, state by state, are huge. What's okay in Michigan could be illegal in Illinois. So the text is filled with exceptions. What's needed is state-specific information.Also, the book lacks coverage of the interesting range of school choice options, and the complicated laws covering this phenomenon."
5,AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL AND BETTER,I find this revision extremely helpful. I will use it with my students this summer. The case studies challenge the student to apply their learnings and learn the skill and art of application.
1,it is a good read. it's the only one for cheese lovers.,"cheese is good and so is this lovely,lovely book"
3,Not As Good As The Gallery,I attended the Los Angeles exhibit at The Perfect Exposure Gallery in March 2005 and seeing these Photographs in person was breathtaking. The pictures in the book don't have the clarity that I witnessed at the exhibit but still capture Dylan when he was emerging as the icon he would become. The book comes sealed in cellophane and inside is the real jewel: Four original prints of Dylan from Gilbert's collection.
5,A young Dylan captured from 1954,"Rock fans will relish Douglas R. Gilbert and Dave Marsh's FOREVER YOUNG: PHOTOGRAPHS OF BOB DYLAN (0306814811, $29.95): over seventy candid photos of a very young-looking Bob Dylan are the focus, taken by an also-young photographer Dan Gilbert back in 1964 on assignment for Look magazine. Gilbert photographed a surprisingly open young Dylan relaxed among fellow musicians at his home, following him from Greenwich Village to the Newport Folk Festival and catching him before he underwent a striking set of changes and made himself inaccessible to media. A unique portrait makes this a real, rare winner and a treat for Dylan fans used to very studied photos."
3,wouldv'e scored higher if it included other songs.,"to my dismay, this cd didn't include such obscure classics like politics,liar,one way love or even lively arts. ARRGGH!! sanctuary shouldv'e omitted the 17 minute curtain call and made room for these songs instead. )0= bummer!! oh wellz, at least i can listen to generals and creep. now that's music for pleasure.(0;"
4,Fun Set!,"There isn't much to this set, but it's not too complicated for my nine year old and he had a lot of fun putting on a show! The tricks are easy enough for him to do and still impressive enough so they aren't too lame to him. He really enjoyed this set!"
3,Different Korea,"Convinced murderer serving a life term won a day off in a family home.Of spending a day at home after ten years at a jail, drama-with-a-twist presents Korea of kind, mutually helpful people, left usually behind in psychotic crime thrillers or porno explorations exported worldwide.A big vogue romantic run of story leaves a room for a viewer's imagination."
3,Good Plot no Explicit Sex,"The book has a lot of potential as far as a good storyline and a good plot; with some amazing and fantastic characters, but the beginning book as well as the sequel is not very explicit so far as erotic scenes go. There is sex in the book, sort of like the ""Freedom Landing"" series by Anne McGaffrey, but there are no outright ""sex"" scenes in the book; it is mostly just implied or stated that two people had sex, but nothing you can really read or get excited about. If a more readable explicit sex scene is what you're after then I would suggest reading Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series (I do!) and that will give you plenty of details in regards to two people having sex, but if you simply enjoy a good plot and good characters then you may enjoy ""Slave Trade."""
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Rosie was a party girl, provided for by her bureaucrat mother. Shedidn't believe that aliens would take her for a sex slave, or that evenhappened. She gets into trouble one too many times, and gets way morethan she bargained for.Her mother had warned her to settle down, but she doesn't, and ends up an alien sex slave."
3,Not as explicite as it could be,"This is the beginning of trilogy that will look at a universe of hierarchy. In that universe, human beings are at the bottome of the ladder, used as sex slaves. However, we aren't shown alot of what that really means. Oh, there are scary emotions described but beyond some beginning lines nothing explicitedly sexual happens. That left me wondering what was so bad -- sort of like the movie ""Spartacus"" before the director's cut came out. Beyond this, Wright does a good job of showing the complex social and political relationships between characters, sometimes there is too much to follow and you have to slow down your reading to be clear on what is happening. A question for the publisher: what is the deal with the cover? It has nothing to do with the book."
4,Fun But Sort of Disappointing,"I liked this book, but it doesn't live up to the sexy cover. In fact, there wasn't much sex or bondage at all. The story is about an Earth that has become a breeding ground for sex slaves that various and sundry aliens enjoy; the main character is abducted, stripped naked and sold to a vile villainess that we see only briefly and she doesn't do much to our heroine before the rescue begins. Our heroine then shares the book with a host of rebels, bad guys and whatnot. The story then spreads out into a Star Trek plot which makes sense since the author is a Trek-novel writer. This is fun sci-fi but boring sex slave stuff. There is no threatening male master on female slave situations, if that's what you're looking for. But well worth a first read because the spaceship battles are highly addictive. This is the first of three books so there is still time for our main character to find herself in the clutches of a male master, alien or otherwise."
2,Not a good read,"Yes, the cover is misleading and the actual story is misleading but that isn't what is wrong with this book. The writing is distinctly poor, character development is sketchy at best. This reads like a piece of B grade fanfiction. This is not a book to buy unless you pick it up from a used bookstore. I def think this is one the average scifi fan can skip. The plotline is neither provokative nor original."
4,"A culturally adept, culinary delight!","This book will absorb you into the culture, the setting, and the food, in a way that you will feel you were there yourself. Sarah Leah Chase is great at giving proper cooking tips to ensure success with her recipes. I've tried many myself, and I've loved them all so far. It's not only pleasant to follow her clear instructions, but it's a learning experience in itself. Every recipe is introduced with a specific time and place of her life experienced in Southern France. I have learned about the culture, the people, the ""paysage"". Every time I finish one of her recipes, I feel like marking the place on my ""to visit"" vacation list. You will fall in love, not only with the food, but with its quality of a rounded learning experience as well."
4,"Wonderful prose, but sometimes short on directions","What a beautiful book, for beautiful cuisine. I have tried many of the recipes, and although they taste good, I have found a few 'glitches' -- for instance, everything sticks to the pan, or the recipe calls for ingredients but then the directions never say when to use them!I am now living in Maussane - one of the towns mentioned in the book - it is nice to have the names of the restaurants so I can taste first-hand without having to cook!"
2,ITEMS ARE TOO BIG AND TOO SMALL,"My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday as a gift. The necklace is to big and heavy, the ring is to big it barely fits me and the bracelet fits my 18 month old not my 3 year old. They definately need to re-design it. Lots of other Dora items out there that are much nicer."
2,HORRIBLE!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"As a mother I would have known better than to buy this toy. But my 2.5 year old daughter was at the toy store with her Papow and wanted this....ONLY BECAUSE SHE SAW DORA ON IT. So he bought it, brought it home and then realized he had made a mistake. The ring is TOO BIG, the bracelet is TOO SMALL, and the neckelace is TOO BULKY. My poor child tries to play with this but it is so poorly designed that she hurts herself trying to wear the bracelet and the necklace is practically as large as her head.Do yourself a favor don't buy this. There are many other Dora toys out there that are cute and worth the money.As for my set it will be on ebay really soon!"
2,good but not good!,my daughter who is 2 and a 1/2 received this for christmas. she really loves it. except the necklace is to big and bulky. i know it should be big for a small child but it does not stay around her neck. it keeps falling off and hurting her toes yet she still insists on wearing. the bracelet fits just perfect with no room for adjustment and the ring is to big but my daughter wears it on 2 fingers instead of 1. wouldn't be something to invest your money in.
3,fun with Dora,"Braclet was a little too small; however, I understand that it has to be made to fit as many children as possible. Necklace that plays Dora's voice and lights up was creative and a big hit."
3,Thouroughly Unimpresses,"I have to say tha I was thoroughly unimpressed with this play. The author seems to be using the same characters that we all know and love, but most of them seem out of character. It's also a musical so every once in a while the characters burst out in song. This can be anoying; especially when you consider the fact that there is on music written for it. The authors tell people to write their own simple music. This is a disaster waiting to happen! The redeeming quality of the book is the other ""helps"" that are included in it. They are very good and in depth dispite how short they are. Overall, I do not recommend this purchase"
3,It's an overview,Only buy this book as an overview of what you are going to have to do. If you need specifics you'll need more books.
4,Amazing reference work!,"Renovation: Completely Revised and UpdatedAs a NEW owner of an OLD house, this is an awesome book. As you set out on the journey to bring a house back to life, there is no shortage of advice and approaches that you hear from people. Having a book like this helps provide vital information and makes you a much more informed consumer or DIY'er. Highly recommended!"
3,For my son,"I have not heard from my son on this product, so I can't rate it. Maybe you could mail this infor to him and get a reply."
1,Look what I did ...,"I bought this hoping there would be some good pointers on HOW TO but instead I got a ""look what I did "" book. It tells very little on any single subject but shows pictures and describes activities of others without telling any ""how to"" essentials on any of the projects described. I returned it and had no problems with Amazon. They were fast and responsive to my returns."
5,I can Do It Myself!,"Loving Wife and I began renovations on our old house when it was our new house, and Michael Litchfield's Renovation was always there with authoritative advice on money- and time-saving methods and materials. Now we're building a three-room addition, and the third edition is a big surprise: tools and materials have changed a lot in the intervening years, and Renovation 3 is helping us do a better job, faster and easier. Litchfield has a gift for using pictures of work in progress to give you the feel of doing the job yourself, and that relieves a lot of anxiety when facing intimidating projects. Highly recommended for everyone, from renters who want to be able to trouble-shoot minor emergencies to owner-builders who want to improve their properties. As Loving Wife says: ""Everything that I have needed to do, from cladding the front of the house with field stone to replacing the rain-gutters, was fully described. I can Do It Myself!"""
5,I'm Sorry,"Dear BR...I'm sorry that you feel that my book is the worst purchase you've made on Amazon. Fortunately thousands of others have benefited from it, including major Universities that have ordered it for their libraries. The industry experts that contributed to this book reveal information on marketing that can not be found in any other source.I truly am happy to personally refund every dime of your purchase if you email me at steve@itreallyworks.tv with your name and address. I'll send a check to you the day I receive your information.I greatly appreciate you trying the book. I'm sorry the information in it was not to your liking.Best wishes,Steven Dworman"
4,"Great, I guess","I purchased this as a gift, so I really don't know how well the product, is performing, but I have not heard any complaints and the person I bought it for says she is saving it for when she returns to work after maternity leave."
5,Awesome!,"I love this bag! It is super organized, and has a place for everything! When I had a bottle leak, the side insulated zipper pocket held all of the liquid with no mess. The little zip baggies for soiled clothes/diapers are great! You'd be surprised at how many places (my pediatrician's office included) discourage you from leaving dirty diapers in the garbage! Those baggies have contained all of my son's messes, and, the odors! I love the pacifier holder that is right on the strap! No digging around in a bag for the pacifier! It is a big (and heavy) bag when packed, but it is very convenient and even my husband likes it. :)"
2,NOT BIG ENOUGH...DIRTY.,I LOVE THAT I CAN KEEP EVERYTHING COLD AND EVERYTHING HAS A PLACE BUT....IT IS SO SMALL ON THE INSIDE CONSIDERING IT IS SO BIG AND HEAVY ON THE OUT. ANOTHER HUGE PROBLEM NOT MENTIONED...CLEANING MICROFIBER. IF YOU GET DIAPER CREAM ON IT FORGET. I EVEN BOUGHT A CLEANER TO CLEAN MICROFIBER AND IT DIDN'T WORK. THE THING WITH MICROFIBER IS THAT THE FIBER CATCHES AND KEEPS ALL THE STAINS ON IT. IT LOOKED TERRIBLE AFTER I USED IT FOR A SHORT TIME. I AM NOW HAVING BABY #2 AND NOT USING THIS ONE.
5,Great Bag!!!,This diaper bag has it all!!! It is large enough to store everything that you may need to take with you for you baby. Plus it is unisex so that your husband can carry it and it does not look like a purse. Can use from birth and up because of it's size and all of the features that it has. A must!!!
3,Not what I hoped for,"I got this based on reviews, large size, fits everything, Mine has a front flap over it, like a messenger bag, that gives you another flat pocket. My two main complaints are the openning and the storage space. I hate the openning; it's more of a slit. If they removed the zipper portion it would be much better; easier to load and unload. The inside is 'squared-off' and sturdy to be supportive, which I thought was the greatest thing when I saw it. I can stack my diapers and clothing and it won't become a jumbled mess. The bag has too much lining inside - I don't need to keep my diapers and clothing cool. I feel I can't fit much more in this bag than the Mini-Messenger bag I use so often. It is such a large size, but only to carry. I expected a lot more."
2,ANOTHER ASS-KICKER IN TOWN,"DECENT FLIC, LORENZO'S ALRIGHT FOR THE STRAIGHT TO DVD FORMAT. HE'S ON PAR WITH CLAUDE, DOLPH, AND STEVEN AS A FORMIDABLE ASSKICKER. HAIL RHODESIA, DEATH TO MUGABE AND SHIBAZZ."
5,"great action, actors, cynematography and virtual reality",I think that this was one of Lorenzo Lamas' best movies...and I've seen them all. I think that Lorenzo is a fine actor.
4,Fun and easy to understand,This is a great book for beginners! It makes it easy to understand and it's a fun read. Great for you and your friends to get together and have some fun.
1,Oh look - a false martyr!!,"Does it even matter that after polic reports and countless eye-witness accounts that it has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that Rachel Scott was not killed for her belief in god? Well it should. Burn this book, it's a sham.Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris are not hateful anti-god monsters, but if it makes it easier for her mother and others to accept the tragedy - go ahead, let them indulge in their lies.In search of better reading try 'No Easy Answers: the Truth Behind Death at Columbine' or the police report available through investigating police department"
4,I like it,"Normally I don't go for this type of sound, but Demon Hunter does it extraordinarily well. The lyrics aren't immediately apparent in their piety but you'll find it if you study them. This is definitely in the top 5 of all Christian metal releases. A very good alternative to some of the junk floating around out there these days."
4,It would actually be a 4 1/2...,"Now, let me begin by saying that death, thrash, or screaming/growling metal vocals usually annoy me. Even other Christian metal bands (i.e. Zao, Extol, Living Sacrifice) I don't really like because the vocals annoy me. But that's just me...But, saying that, Demon Hunter's debut CD ROCKS! The thing I like about it is I can actually understand most of the words and the way they mix up the clean singing with the screaming is awesome! Musically I love the riffs and punchiness in the songs. The two softer songs (""My Throat"" and ""Gauntlet"") are amazing as well, delivering dark, somewhat haunting music and lyrics. And, also, they don't feel the need to have foul language, talk about extremely idiotic junk, and all the other stuff that other bands like this do (Slipknot, Mudvayne, Drowning Pool, blah blah whoever)."
5,Awsome,"This is probably the best CD that I own. I am just starting to get into Metal Music, and this is the best Christian metal I have heard. I started listening to Zao and that got me interested in other metal bands, but now that I have heard Demon Hunter, Zao is no where near the quality or versatility of Demon Hunter. I would reccomend this CD to anyone who likes Christian or Non-Christian metal."
2,Disappointed,"I love Solid State Records, they have hosted a lot of awsome bands and albums. This cd does have a little potential, and I do admit that My Throat is an open grave and the gauntlet are very catchy. This Album can be defined as nothing other than a Nu-Metal album which, in no way resembles the band Slipknot. I guess Solid State saw the need to release a Nu-Metal album to promote themselves, and I don't blame em, cuz a lot of people seem to like demon hunter. They just don't appeal to me, I'm just more of a hardcore/screamo kid. Some stuff I would recommend: Norma Jean, The Agony Scene, Underoath, Evergreen Terrace, Poison the Well (old), As Hope Dies, Narcissus, Zao."
4,Demon Hunter,"Demon Hunters debut release is definetly a winner. I found out about this band from a friend of mine and then saw that they were featured on the Headbanger's Ball CD. Demon Hunter crawls on a fine line between hardcore and metalcore...but its awesome none-the-less. They are alike Killswitch Engage in a sense that the verses are hard-hitting and brutal and then you have beautiful, melodic choruses. The lyrics are well written and can be compared to real life situations. One thing I noticed is that every song has a section that made me rewind and listen to it again...and the songs get stuck in your head. I like that. DH also uses a good deal of electronics. I generally dont like this in metal...but Demon Hunter found a way to make it fit into their sound..and it sounds damn good. I definetly recommend this album.Best Song: Turn Your Back and RunOne Word Review: Memorable"
4,Big surprise...,"I'm from the ""old-school"" death metal scene with impossible guitar riffs and drum rolls and I'm usually not very impressed with this more recent stuff. However this cd kinda surprised me. While not nearly as intense as the kings, Living Sacrifice, this is one great debut. The guitar playing can be dull and boring sometimes, but for the most part it's played very well. The drum playing is very tight and adds alot to the songs. The bass playing, while not in the forefront, adds an eerie touch to a lot of the songs; and is very well played on the ""ballad"" track.A great twist to this band is the singers great ""singing"" voice, as well as his ""screaming"" voice. He sings cleanly very well. Alot of the songs, while heavy, have a lot of singing in them...which seems like the new fad nowadays. Anyhow...great debut. I'm sure these guys will only get better with time...they definately have lots of talent. Oh yeah, their cd insert is really cool, and their website is really stunning as well."
4,not quite as good as their other album,"although this album is good, i dont think its as great as their other album. Summer of darkness has a milder and more polished sound in all, but is still unmistakably hardcore. This album invokes more hardcore vocals and effects. still its a good buy if ur a demon hunter fan"
3,A good band but...,"I guess bands with christian guys should talk about Jesus, God in their lyrics. Mention it! I really agree with that guy who said many ppl r going to hell everyday n we're doing nothing... see, i listen so much their songs, they are very good but they forget to mention directly God, a name as a reference u know.. thats all God bless us. P.S.: im not questioning their beliefs, but i still dont know why write lyrics without mention that NAME! marknroll@hotmail.com"
3,Not bad for a Slipknot clone,"This band surprised me actually. First things first, they ARE a Slipknot clone, with a few other moments of Deftones and assorted popular metal acts. This is the Christian music's answer to nu-metal's popularity, in the hopes of providing an alternative from all that scary evil music. Many of the reviewers here will say they are original and whatnot, but really it's not.I did listen this record and to my surprise I enjoy it. Like a budget version of Slipknot they kick out beats and riffery. There's a bit more melodic singing here, but really nothing new or groundbreaking. However, it's got it's moments and overall its not a bad listen. It also doesn't try and shove a message down your throat, and that's usually a good thing, and in this case it most definitly is."
5,Demon hunter excellent album !!!!!!!!!,Fast and a very hard hitting album. And very hard hitting songs on here this cd was their very first. And many more great ablums demon hunter has made since day by day this group will only get better. A good postive message in metal world. Machine gun basting riffs and rageing loud vocals on here feel's like you what knock the devil on his butt. I think most people like this one whether you are a christian or not.
5,These guys are BLESSED!!!,"Score: 5 StarsI encourage you to buy this groundbreaking album. My reasons? EVERY song has a deeper-than-skin meaning and if you get it you'll understand where im coming from. Vocals are where this CD scores high. Vocals are harsh except in a few songs like ""infected"" which sound pleasant and called-for. Anybody who says this band isn't worth your time doesn't like this type of music. Disregard their comments. Their lyrics glorify god. Some bands do it differently than others. I could bang my head to every song on this CD. My favorites in particular areScreams of the undead: #1Through the black: #5Gauntlet: #10For Jesus"
5,"Wow - Awsome CD, one of the best...","First off, if you like heavy metal, hardcore groups, this is the band for you. Demon Hunter brings pounding riffs and amazing drumming. And plus, they bring the message of God, as they are a christian band. I would suggest this for the rocker at heart, it is a great buy, and you will definetly be satisfied."
1,WORST THING EVER,Im sorry but the hype was not lived up to. the guitars are weak and the vocals are wierd but not in that good break something attitude.Im sorry guys it just plain out is bad!
3,Lots of Static,"I bought this moniter after my friend recommended it. I am sorry that I did not do research first. Although hers works just great, mine was pure static from day one. If I turn it down to the lower settings, I can still hear my baby okay and the static isn't too bad, but, if I had to do it all over, I would invest in a more expensive model, or forego the moniter altogether. From what I can tell, you have a fifty/fifty shot of getting a static-free model. I lost the gamble; I hope you have better luck!"
1,Way too noisy for us!!,"We purchased this monitor after our first monitor of a year and a half (Graco SoundSleep) started to go out. As soon as I plugged this in and turned on the receiver, all I heard was loud buzzing. I guess it depends on where you live, and apparently this is a good one for some people, but not for us. I much prefer the Graco SoundSleep. We never had any static or interference, and even when turned up very loud it made little noise. I would recommend it to anyone in need of a baby monitor. The only problem that developed was one of the receivers (it comes with 2) has started to go out, but I am going to continue using it with one receiver."
3,Ok Monitor,"We purchased this monitor thinking we would use it, but never really did. On the couple occasions we did use it, it seemed to work ok. It now has become a toy for the kids; they love to see the lights on the monitor. There was some static when we used it, and we were able to hear another family's conversation once."
3,Poor quality,"My mother purchased this monitor for me. I receive no static when the monitor is operation on batteries, however battery life runs really short if left on for long periods of time. When I utilize the plug for this monitor all I get is static and it is really difficult to sleep at night with nothing but static and who wants to purchase batteries all the time? Not me."
2,not thrilled at all,"These monitors were priced reasonably, but I would have rather paid more if that meant better quality. My husband and I have to sleep with the monitor in our bed because it seems to be much less static if a person is close to it. If we touch it, the static seems to decrease. I do like the two monitors and that it can clip on your hip if you are moving around, but I find the static extremely annoying and disturbing. Many other reviewers say that it may be their area. Where is a monitor that will work in anyone's area??"
2,Do you like to hear a constant buzz while you sleep?,"If you don't like to hear a constant buzz while you are trying to sleep, then don't buy this product. Yes, this product has a constant buzz when it is turned ""on"". Very annoying. My husband hates it and I just deal with it. The buzz is there even when the volume is turned all the way down. I'm getting ready to shop for a video monitor to replace this thing.I do need to address the static. I did not get static when it was new and but I have experienced it. I've had it for 18 months and I noticed that I get static when it's windy outside. The static can be so bad that you wonder if someone has shut it off to cause it to static. Otherwise I hear BUZZZZZZZZZ all night long.Hope this helps someone. Perhaps look at the reviews for a different brand."
1,Disappointed...,I am very disappointed in this monitor. I have battled white noise and static from day one. I recommend something with better reviews!!
3,Not exactly as I had hoped!,"We put our baby in the nursery at three weeks old so I started using this monitor from the beginning. I almost took it back then and didn't...wish I had because now I have to go purchase another one anyway. We also had static. When I tried changing to the other channel it was worse. I was so tired I guess I just got used to it. Now, only a few months later, we are picking up some crazy radio station on both channels. Perhaps I should have read these reviews earlier! The one thing that I really do like about this is that I can put batteries in the reciever, clip it to my waist and walk around the house getting things done. Very convenient."
5,Had no problems with it,"We liked the dual receivers for a two story house and the lights feature so you didn't have to have the sound turned up very high. We never had a problem with static unless the sound is turned on very high and the monitor plugged in. I can hear my baby taking deep breaths when the sound is pretty low. There is really not need to have it up very high. We watch movies with the TV volume turned up pretty loud, but there is not need to turn the monitor up very loud since you can see the lights. You can also turn the knob on and off and control the volume with your thumb, so maybe the people that had the problems with the knob, had a defective unit."
3,Lights are great but it's hard to adjust the volume.,"While we do like the light feature, we hate the volume control dials. The dials that turn the receiver units on and adjust the volume are very hard to move. It's virtually impossible to turn the unit off or on with one hand (i.e., when you are holding your baby). The first set we had stopped working within 6 months (it just broadcast static all of a sudden) and FP replaced the unit for free with an updated model. While this new ""improved"" unit is similar to its predecessor, the receiver dials were redesigned and are really hard to turn on and off. This was definitely a step down from the previous model that was very easy to adjust. The lights are nice, but we would prefer ease-of-use if we ever have to buy a new monitor in the future."
2,It has a mind of it's own...,I read all the reviews but figured we lived in a small enough house and really won't use it but boy was I wrong! In the middle of the night the monitor will go to LOUD static and won't stop. It has made me jump a few times and even one time we left the downstairs one on and I made Hubby get up to see what it was! Tee hee. The thing is haunted. It works great one day and the next you can't even have it on because of the awful noise it's making. And we have heard neighbors talking! My advice: save the box so you can take it back.
1,Poor quality,"We liked the two receiver idea, but the poor sound quality was not worth it. The receivers didn't work well in our house, frequently noisy and out of range. We went with a Sony monitor, which we love. Moving the receiver around is no big deal at all!"
1,Terrible Monitor,"If you like to hear lots of static, rather than monitor your child, this is the monitor for you.Yes, there are periods where the monitor is usable and there is no static, but you never know when it will go into static mode, which I would estimate it does around 20% of the time.Also, after a few weeks of use, adjusting the volume control would send the receivers into fits of uncontrollable static. This is a permanent re-occuring problem.Under no circumstances should you purchase this monitor if you want a reliable piece of equipment."
3,Buzz,This monitor serves it's purpose...loudly. We get quite a bit of static on both channels but have to leave it on channel B or we pick up the neighbor's little boy. The main problem is the constant buzzing if the thing is turned on. We only use ours about 4 nights a week so I am not going to bother taking it back and getting another (this was our second one anyway)I can't help but think there is a better one out there though.
2,So much STATIC,"I received this as a gift and was thrilled that it came with two monitors (a real plus), but cannot stand how much noise it makes. It constantly emits static, so that my mom cannot even tell if the sound receiver is off or on."
1,Fisher Price Baby Monitor,"The monitor worked great at first. Now my baby is 15 months old and after we have the monitor on for about 15 minutes, you hear a loud noise. There is only a 1 year manufacturer's warranty. I am not sure what to do. Has anyone tried to take them back to the store? I would like a replacement of some sort. I got them on my registry so I don't have the receipt."
2,Complete Static,"We purchased this product when our first option was out of stock, big mistake. We've had Graco monitors for the last 2 years which were always clear but finally died on us. We gave these a try and were very dissapointed. One thing that bothered us was that we run a fan in our son's room for white noise and over the monitor this sounded like really bad static, this never happened on our old monitors. Without the fan on, it wasn't as bad but still not as good as our old ones. I am returning these and waiting for my Graco ones to come in."
2,Too Much Static,I am a first time mom and received this monitor as a gift. The monitor has a very loud static sound and is much too noisy. The monitor does pick up noise but there is no way you could sleep or even watch T.V. without being annoyed by the static. I would not recommend this product.
4,pretty happy but could be better,I received this monitor as a baby shower gift and I'm not complaining. It works pretty good. The only thing that makes me give it 4 stars is that it has a lot of static in the background. In order to keep the static out of it you have to keep it on real low which makes it hard to hear your baby until he is crying real loud. Overall though it does work good as long as you don't mind listening to the background static in it and I would recommend this monitor to others.
3,Not great but does work,We bought one of these and noticed that all it did was create static but we thought it had something to do with the fact that it was an open package so we got another one for my parent's house and it works just fine in fact the range of the monitor is so good it works between houses. The concept is a good one and I recommend this kind of monitor especially for new parents.
4,Aweful Reception,"Not only does this constantly buzz, but in addition, its quite useless as the receiver does not always pick up the signal from the transmitter. I would not recommend this for more than a few feet, in which case, just use your ears."
1,Ick!,"We returned this monitor for a variety of reasons. We have another set, firstly. Secondly, this monitor picks up the conversations of the neighbors from their monitor better than it picks up our own babies upstairs. The static was unnerving, and if you didn't place the unit just so it sounded like a TV on a dead channel. Plus, the lights lit constantly, so it wasn't exactly doing its job there. We could only handle it for a few days and gave up. If you have this one, I wish you better luck than we had."
1,Not the monitor for us,"This monitor has BAD static. And having to sleep next to this thing while it is making a buzzing noise it not going to happen. We are looking for something better at this very time. The reason I got this monitor was because of the feedback that people had written on it, And it was all good fot the most part. But the product does not work for us."
1,Static and Loud Obnoxious Buzzes,"We registered for this monitor based on a Baby Bargains review and the fact it had two receivers. Unfortunately, it produced lots of static, but even worse were the intermittent, LOUD, very sudden buzzing sounds it produced. There is no way we could sleep with this in our room! We switched to the Sony 900 megahertz and it was definately worth the extra money! Crystal clear reception and no static."
1,"Static, Static, Static","I received this monitor as a baby shower gift from my mother-in-law so I was unable to return it. This monitor has been a hassle from the very start. When plugged in, all we get is static. The static isn't as bad when using its battery supply, but it was still hard to hear our daughter unless she was very loud. We have finally gotten tired of this monitor and are switching to a Sony.If you want to sleep I would suggest getting a different monitor."
2,Keep looking...,"This monitor has a lot of static on it, even when used with the AC adaptor. Took me awhile to get used to sleeping with it on. My biggest problem with it though is that the turn button for the volume is very hard to adjust...you just can't get a good grip on it and is very difficult to turn which really aggravates me. The only good thing about it is the two recievers, but I'm certain you could find a superior product."
1,Horrible Static!,We bought this monitor because it was recommended as a Best Pick in a baby magazine. I have had nothing but problems with it. The static is horrible and it makes a constant humming on one channel and a buzzing every 2 seconds on the other. I have an old Graco monitor from 1997 that we still use for another child - still to this day we have no problems with static! We're taking this one back and exchanging it for a different one!
1,Toys yes... electronics NO!,"We got this monitor as a shower gift and at first, it worked OK, but then it quit working all together when our son was 10 months old. My husband said there's a short in the base antenna , so he pulls on it and twists it until it works again. It works for a few days and then we have to ""adjust"" it again, which has gotten ridiculous. Also, the static is HORRIBLE and always has been, but we tried to live with it. This morning, it finally stopped working for good and we barely used it for a year. Try the Sony Babycall Nursery Monitor -- it's so quiet we have to tap it to see if it's on! A big change from this staticky piece of junk."
3,receiver died after 18 months,"Monitor has worked fine, although we did have a bit of a problem with static, especially when the receiver is placed near an appliance, such as the fridge, cordless phone or TV.One of my receivers died after about 18 months and not only did the manufacturer refuse to replace it (past the warranty) but they wouldn't even SELL me a new receiver by itself. They told me I'd have to buy a whole new package just to replace the one receiver. I am expecting another baby, and will have to purchase a whole new monitor in order to have 2 receivers. Guess what - it won't be the Fisher Price Sound N Lights."
1,Too much static and interference,"We got this monitor as a gift from our baby registry after reading good reviews in books and online. I was very disappointed in the sound quality, as I was unable to eliminate static and interference even by switching channels, and moving the unit around. There was an annoying hum from the unit when it was plugged into the wall, and the baby could hardly be heard when it was in battery mode.Overall, very disappointing, and now I have to go and try other ones."
3,Lots of Static,"I purchased this monitor the other day and thought I would try it out just to see how well it worked before baby comes. Well, I tried one in our bedroom, which is a short distance from the baby's room and got a lot of loud static, no matter where I placed it. I then tried one in our family room (we do not have a very big house) and again, got nothing but a lot of static. Sure, you can turn the volume way down, but to me that pretty much defeats the purpose of a monitor, especially if you are watching TV or maybe outside with a lot of background noise. I will be returning this and looking for another model."
2,"It's OK, I'm sure there are Better.","This monitor is ""staticky"". I mean if it's the only one you have then it's fine because you can still hear your child, but the amount of static is annoying and kind of distracting if you are trying to do work. I would suggest that parents shop around before purchasing an item that is cheaper."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"We bought this item when I was still pregnant with our son. This monitor may have certain cute features but they only lasted a few months before they stopped working all together. The ""montitoring"" part is the worst of all. It picks up some sort of interference and actually makes a loud ""CB"" sound. So loud it has been waking up my son and we didn't know it. We thought he was just restless or teething. Our son is now two, and we are finally tired of this poor investment. We are going to buy one of the cheaper ones. Do not buy!"
1,Static all night long!!!!,"We received this monitor system for a baby gift but have not used it until now, our daughter is 7months old and now upstairs in her room. We tried many locations in our room as the directions said and still had nothing but static and red lights. This system worked wonderful for our friends but terrible for us. My suggestion is to keep your box and receipt and give it a try, we kept neither and now are shopping for a new monitor system."
1,Static and feedback,"I also ended up having static and feedback with my monitor. It didn't happen at first though, only like a month after purchasing it. It was so bad it kept us up at night. The company says to send it in to fisher price but what am I supposed to do in the meantime. We have to have a monitor and now TRU won't take it back because it is past the 90 days. I do not recommend this monitor."
1,Fisher Price employees must be writing the good reviews,"Tonight has been ANOTHER frustrating night trying to get a decent signal from this piece of garbage. One channel is useless, as it blasts out deafening static. The other channel only occasionally is tolerable, but mostly has an unacceptable level of static that gets worse when it is plugged into the AC adaptor.Maybe Fisher Price sells a special wrench that can get a grip on this poorly designed on/off/volume knob. I can barely turn it using both hands, let alone try it one-handed with a sleeping baby in my arms.May God strike me down if I ever consider buying another Fisher Price product that plugs into an outlet. Don't make the same mistake I did."
2,"Worked great at first, but...","We received this monitor as a shower gift before my son was born. It worked GREAT for the first 6 months or so, but now one of the receivers makes a horribly loud static sound, and only works when it is turned up full blast. The other one doesn't do this, and it doesn't matter where either of them are located.The other terrible thing about these is that sometimes the plug in attachment slips just out of its connection, so the lights work, but no sound comes out. I look at the monitor, think it is working, and then hear my son crying upstairs - the monitors lights are going, but NO SOUND! I don't have monitors so that I can sit and stare at them. This happens all the time - without touching the machine - it just STOPS WORKING.I'm very disappointed with these monitors. I'm shopping for another brand right now for our second child."
3,Lots of Static,"These monitors get the job done, but even the slightest breeze can create a lot of static. The range is good (works in our 3-story home). I like that they plug in and work off batteries as well."
5,Excellent Moniter,"We received this moniter as one of our shower gifts. I simply love it. I like that it has two receivers and it lights up when your baby makes a noise. It really picks up my DS sounds, I can acutally hear my DS snoring. I have had no problems with static. I haven't tried the batteries yet we just plug it in the outlet and it does great. We mostly keep it stautionary in one place, one in our bedroom and in the living room. I am glad that we registered for this and highly reccommend it to all first time parents. Excellent Moniter!!!"
2,The static is terrible!,"This monitor does the job...I can even hear my baby breathing if I turn it up loud enough. It's cheap and works. But, my two major complaints are that 1. the batteries die in a matter of a couple hours. All the devices can be plugged in, but that isn't the most convenient option all the time. And, 2. the static it gives off is incredibly annoying. Not so much static if the devices are being used with battery power, but as soon as you plug them in, forget it. We've tried different channels, different locations in the house (away from cordless phones, microwaves, anything plugged in) and nothing makes is better. We've lived with it for 10 months now and my husband is forcing to buy another one, no matter what it costs. Just buy another brand!"
3,Mediocre Quality at a cheap price.,"This was the second monitor we purchased. We thought we had to replace an older version of the same thing. We are still using the older one (now 5 yrs old) and return this ""Sounds N Light"" version.This one looked fancy but everywhere we placed it had static. All settings/channels/volume still gave a static hiss. We have alot of wireless items in the house so that may have been affecting it. However the old one (also made by Fisher Price) doesnt have this problem. The static wasnt a problem with the baby, they never heard it. But trying to sleep next to it all night long would just drive us nuts."
3,"Lights are good in theory, BUT...","The sound-sensitive lights are a great idea in theory, but create a huge distraction if the monitor is used at night in a darkened room. I had to end up covering the monitor with a small blanket so I wouldn't see the lights flash while we were trying to sleep (I could still hear it if necessary).The good news is that it's a very sensitive monitor and would pick up any noises that I needed to hear. Without the red lights, I would have thought it perfect...or have an on/off feature for the lights."
2,"Not so great, but works well enough for the price...","This monitor I received as a baby shower gift and I hate it! It has horrible static. If you walk around it or get too close it gets worse. If the phone rings same thing. I didn't expect to much from it, but I must say I can hear my son pretty well, and I like the fact that I can see the red lights. They help me to determine if he is just groaning and searching for his thumb, or if he is actually in distress. Great concept, needs some work."
3,ok,"I got this for a friend a few years back who had just had a baby girl. She said they worked pretty well most of time, sometimes there is a lot of static, and other times it works fine. She is now having her second baby and said she is going to replace them for something more current."
4,Excellent (for us),"We get zero static from this monitor. That doesn't mean that you won't because it's entirely dependent on many factors that may or not be present in you house. Our apartment has old wiring with few outlets and we do not have a cordless phone, only cellphones.The clarity and detail of sound is excellent (which is likely why it's prone to static for some) and the lights are a huge bonus--if for some reason you can't hear baby crying, you may see the lights go off.I agree with the reviewer who wanted a battery backup for the base unit, in case power goes out. That lost this product a star.The other units use either an adapter that has a nice long cord, or a 9v battery. When the unit is plugged in, the unit does not drain the battery--a great feature.All in all, this is an excellent baby monitor. Just save your receipt in case your place and the monitor don't get along."
1,Horrible buzzing Noise,"I bought this monitor because I own a previous Fisher Price Sounds N Light monitor and it worked great. It had crystal clear reception. It did look different than this model though. This model has been horrible. The buzzing noise is constant, even on the lowest volume setting and if we try it on the alternate channel it lets out a rythmic high pitched warble. I thought I would just deal with it, but today I am returning it because I can barely hear my baby the static is so bad."
5,"Good price, good monitor","After purchasing and looking at other monitors, we decided to keep this one. The main reason is for the price I feel it is a good bargain. The only problem that I have with it is that there is a low whine, but not annoying enough to hinder reception or sleep. We have a 2-story house and with the dual receivers I can hear my son's every whimper any where in the house and outside. I especially like the bonus of having the lights just in case there is other noise in the house, i.e. washer & dryer, dishwasher, etc."
2,Static........... Static ..............Static...............,I am very diapointed with this product. This monitor has a lot of static and unclear reception. Most of the times I just stay very close to my childs room and do something quiet b/c the monitor has so much static that you concentrate to hard on trying to hear your child over all the static that instead of accomplishing the things that you would like to while your child is sleeping you are to busy trying to hear your child over all the static. I would not recommend this monitor.
2,Lots of batteries,"I've had this monitor for 10 months and am looking for a new one! It works as far as hearing my daughter, but that is the only good thing about it. We keep one plugged in and use the other one wherever we go around the house. The batteries run out really fast and after changing them too often we stripped the screw on the back. We traded it for the one we keep plugged in, but now the volume dial is messed up and makes a ton of static everytime we touch it. I am done! I am ready for a new monitor!"
2,On/Off Dial Difficult to Turn,"I returned this product after trying it for a week due to the difficult on/off dial on the receivers. The dial barely sticks up off of the device enough to get a grip on it, and there isn't even an edge that you could use your fingernail to turn it with. I knew that if I couldn't turn it on easily, my husband definitely couldn't with his larger fingers. The last thing I need is for him to have an excuse not to watch the baby."
3,Serves its purpose,"The monitor served its purpose; if she cried we heard it. The greatest feature was the lights. During those long nights of getting her to sleep through the night is was great to be able to turn the sound down some and still see the lights moving. Being able to plug them in was great as well. She is 6 months old and the batteries are still working. We just moved to a smaller house and we can't use them anymore because the static drives us crazy! If they are too close the don't work too well. One night we even heard a man fighting with his son to get in the bath tub, yet none of our direct neighbors had children. The biggest design flaw would be that it is too hard to turn on and off while holding the baby."
3,"I like the lights and the sound is fine, but some static","I like this baby monitor, but we do pick up some static. it isn't so much that I can't hear whats going on in the nursery, I mean I can still hear the baby breathing or kicking around his blankets. It is a little annoying at night though to constantly hear faint static coming out of the monitor.On the plus side, I like the dual recievers and the portability of the recievers."
3,Lots of static,"I received this as a gift and it gets the job done. However, there is a lot of static."
1,"Static, noisey and not worth it!","We registered for this monitor based on the fact that it was one of the only monitors on the market that offered two handsets. This monitor has the loudest ""hmmm"" that I have heard from any monitor - regardless of which station we put the monitor on. It barely provides coverage to the outside deck on our house. There is no range on this monitor and the backround noise it makes is unbearable to have on in the room while we were sleeping. I would return it - however we didn't keep the box. Very disappointed! Would not recommend."
3,Depends on where you live. . .,"I registered and received these montiors for my baby shower. I was not as delighted as expected. The static was unreal at my home. No matter what channel I had it on it was so loud I was hardly able to sleep. When going to my mother-in-law's house it worked fine though. I do live out in the country where she lives closer to the city so that may have something to do with it. If you have a lot of land and live out in the country DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM, but if you live in the city it's not a bad buy."
2,Lots of static,"We got these monitors for our first baby thinking that all monitors were the same. We have found these to have lots of static even when the volume is turned low and with changing the channel. Also we have travled to PA and VT to visit family and have had the same problem with the static like we do at home. So, I don't think it has to do with where you live.The lights are a great idea and comes in handy for when I'm running the vaccum or hair dryer. I can easily see when baby is making noises."
3,Great if you don't live near an airport,I've had these monitors since my daughter was born in April '04 and they worked great till we moved about 3 weeks ago. We now live 5 miles away from a very busy international airport and right in the flight line.... whenever a plane passes ove all i get is static... however once the plane has passed everything is fine... But I will invest in new ones for this next baby
4,Works well but lots of static,"We decided to buy this monitor. I really don't remember why, maybe the price. I think it was maybe $20.00 dollars when we bought it. Should of shopped around a little and spent more money.It does work pretty good. The only thing I don't like about it is that it has a lot of static if you turn it up to far. Other than that I like it and will continue to use it. Our daughter's room is right next to ours so we can keep the volume down really low and still be able to hear her at night.I would recommend this monitor if you don't mind hearing a lot of static. It does sound kind of scary at night ! I wouldn't recommend watching the movie White Noise while having one of these."
2,Too much Static,"The receiver stinks. I know someone with the same one and they like it but they are too static-y. One can barely turn it up without walking the baby with the static. We are getting rid of it and getting something else.And to add insult to injury, first time we had it on and I went to the room to make sure it was working, our brand new TV that was in the line of fire of the monitor and receiver got a damaged picture tube. seems something in the electronics is messed up. No, this monitor has to go."
1,Bad static,We have been using our monitor for 4 months now. About a month or more ago it started to get static. Now it's just so bad I am not getting any sleep. The static drowns out the noise of my son. I am definetly getting a new one ASAP!
5,Wounderful baby Monitor,I really like this monitor. it is easy to use and travels well. I have not had any problems with it ever! It is a baby must!
5,Awesome monitor,This is a terrific monitor. The light feature it great when you don't care to listen to the static. Two stations are handy. Great fisher price product.
3,Have to try it to see if it works for you!,"This monitor seems to either get great reviews or poor reviews...meaning that it works for some people and not for others. It really depends on your particular house whether or not you will get static or interference. When I used this monitor alone, it worked great. But in combination with my monitor for my other child, there was a lot of static and interference. You simply have to try it and see if it works for you. I had a Graco monitor that worked perfectly fine, but finding a second monitor to work without interference was difficult. I had to try 4 different monitors to find the right one! I ended up on getting another Graco monitor."
1,Can't get them to work,"My husband and I spent 3 hours trying to get these monitors to even work! What a waste of time. We tried moving them from room to room, channel to channel, and outlet to outlet. We put the radio on in the baby's room (as the direction stated)and all we heard was a horrible buzzing noise. We tried everything and nothing worked. I gave this product one star because it made me put at least one in, it doesn't deserve one! We are returning them today. What a piece of junk!!!"
1,Disappointed,"My husband and I registered for this monitor because of the good reviews it received in the Baby Bargains book. We also liked that there were two receivers. Once our daughter was born and we started using it, all we heard was STATIC. We returned it and got the Sony Baby Call monitor. It only has one receiver but worth it because there is absolutely no static. Skip the Fisher Price Sound and Lights and go straight for the Sony."
3,They do work,"Like so many others (for what I've seen in some reviews) at first I thought I had thrown away my money, but now the baby's here and it's working ok. The monitor is very useful and is a great bargain. It is true what have been told about the channels, if you hear too much feedback just switch to the other channel and you'll be ok. It's not the cleanest sound of them all but the monitor is worth the price you're going to pay for it and you can clearly hear any noise coming from where your baby is at, and that's the whole point ,isn't it?"
2,Only so-so product,"This is our first child so we weren't really sure what to get for our son, but we made a mistake in trusting the Fisher Price name. This product did well for the first month, but that is mostly because we didn't need to use it that much, since our son was in our room in a bassinet or downstairs with us in his pack and play. Now that he is in his crib and we are in need of the monitor - this one is just not getting the job done. I have been awakened four times in the past two weeks from another child's cries. I don't get enough sleep as it is as a new parent, we can't afford to be awoken by someone else's baby. We've tried changing channels but will only get static from this. At times all we are getting is static, other times it works just fine. I need a more reliable product than this."
1,Monitor allows to hear all kinds of static and white noise,"Not what we expected. We just tried this monitor out, and it doesn't allow us to hear anything. We were interested in a monitor with 2 receivers..there aren't that many out there, so we picked this one. Back to finding one that works...very disappointed."
1,My FP monitors that are 9 yrs old work better than this one!,"With baby #3 - we decided to get a new monitor because our old Fisher Price one is kind of dingy and you have to jiggle the cord a bit. Bought this Sound and Lights one and it is PURE MISERY! The STATIC is horrible and worse yet...if it does happen to pick up the baby's cry it immediately turns itself off. We've tried everything - batteries, jiggling the cord, taping the dial, different plugs, different outlets, different houses - All the same STATIC. There is absolutely no way we can use these monitors. We've given it a few months but my patience is gone. Off to find another option and have some quiet in my home again."
5,Worked Great For Me,"I received the dual sounds and lights monitors at a baby shower before my daughter, Sophie was born (now 3 months). I loved that it has two receivers. We keep one upstairs and one downstairs so one will always be handy. Yeah I agree with some of the others who say there is static, but for the price I think it's still a great deal. We typically place the monitor where it can be seen(with volume all the way down), turn it on and glance at it ever so often while we watch television or whatever else we happen to be doing. If we see the lights go up and get brighter we go to the monitor, turn the volume up and then decide what needs to be done next. However I do not use the monitors while I sleep. I am close enough to her that I can hear her. I definitely recommend this on amazon.com and to my friends. Again I say for the price it's a GREAT deal, if it had cost $100 or more yeah I'ld be mad that is wasn't perfect. . .but I am 100% satisfied and pleased"
2,Lots of Static - 2nd Receiver Died,"In the beginning these worked fine as long as I placed the monitor far away from the baby's crib. Although if you run any type of humidifier, fan or a/c in the nursery - forgot about hearing anything! Also, the 2nd monitor died after about 8 months and we couldnt get any feedback at all. I will definately be switching to a different brand."
4,Works pretty good for us,"Pretty good monitor. I like having 2 receivers. I also really like the lights!! The quality of the reception does seem to depend on your location (or the location of the monitor). If I move the monitor around in my baby's room I will get different quality of reception on the receiver. Just play around with it a little. We ended up putting it on the floor (on the carpet). What ever works right? There is still a little static sometimes, but I don't know if that can be helped. I can hear my baby very clearly with this monitor set."
3,"Staticky, but good.","Yes, We also get a ton of static on these monitors. But, they work great. I can hear every sound my daughter makes...even with the static. I have found that if you keep the volume a little low - still loud enough to hear her breath - it isn't that bad. Also, on the batteries there is hardly any static at all.My only complaint is the main monitor does not have a battery back-up...thus, 3 stars."
1,Lots of Static,I purchased this monitor set from BabiesRus and my sons' room is about 15 feet from mine and all I get on the monitor is static. Now I could understand all the static if the base and the receiver were more than 50 feet from eachother but 10 to 15 feet with a line of sight from the receiver to the base through the doorways of the rooms is crazy. At this distance with a line of sight you should get no static at all. I would NOT recomend this monitor to anybody.
4,Great monitor.,I originally purchased this monitor because of the two receivers. That way I wouldn't have to keep moving one around. I leave one plugged-in in our bedroom for at night and the other is in our family room. I really like the light indicator on the monitor. At night I can have the sound turned down low and the light wakes me up when my baby cries. My only problem is when you try to use them with batteries. All I got was static. As long as you use the AC adapter there is no static. But since I tend to leave these plugged in this moniter serves its purpose.
4,love so far,"We have a 2 week old and knew we needed a monitor. We chose this one after a baby bargains book recommended it. We have been very happy with it as you can turn the volume down but still see the lighted bars when baby wakes up. I have had no interferance from other phones or monitors from neighbors. So far, am very pleased."
2,Disappointed,"I've been disappointed with this monitor. I didn't think that there would be that big of a difference between monitors, but when my second baby was born (my girls are only 18 months apart) I needed a second monitor. I chose Fisher Price for my second one so that I could tell which monitor went to which girl. My first monitor was The First Years. Unfortunately, the Fisher Price model has MUCH more static and white noise when turned on than does The First Years monitor.I can hear my daughter on it but the amount of white noise/static is quite annoying--even when the volume is turned down really low."
3,OK monitor,"I received this monitor as a shower gift. The monitor is really just OK. It's not great nor excellent. I have a 3 story townhouse in the suburbs and I can pick up my neighbor's phone conversations and a lot of static. I've tried changing the cannel and one gives me the phone conversations, whilst the other gives me the static. I opted for the static needless to say. I've moved the receivers around and read everything everyone else who has no problems suggested on here. I guess it just depends on where you live."
1,Constant Buzzing,"We have had a Fisher Price Sounds & Lights monitor in the past and loved it, however, this new model buzzes constantly. The buzzing is so loud that we can barely hear any sounds the baby makes over the annoying sound!I called Fisher Price to comment and they said that various electrical equipment can interfere... cordless phones, secruity systems, satellite dishes, etc. We have tried every troubleshooting tip to get this monitor to stop buzzing and nothing works.The dual receivers are great, but not when you can't hear what's going on over the buzzing.The previous model of this monitor was fantastic! I would not recommend the new model."
1,HAZARDOUS,"My son just turned 7 months old, and he's started to crawl around. Thank God I got to this monitor before he did. The monitor cord has exposed itself. There has been no stress or tautness on the cord, yet the electrical wires are exposed. It's a known fact that you need to hide the cords from your children, and i'm glad that I hid the cord from my son. This monitor's defect is hazardous, and I'm definately going to buy a new one. Don't buy it! I just notified the CSPC (the recall people) and hope they take some action. I'm sure this defective device is in millions of nurseries in the U.S. Please.... Don't buy this product!"
2,Constant buzzing noise,"I registered for this monitor because the reviews were overall good. When I got it for my shower, I decided to open it up and try it (thank goodness I decided to test it right away). I had the reciever on the lowest volume setting and could still hear a constant buzzing noise. The louder the volume, the more static and buzzing noise I could hear. I went back to the reviews and they said that other electrical equipement can interfere with it and it suggested to move the recievers around to different spots in the room to find the perfect spot. Well...that did not work. I have tried everything and the monitor is still not quiet. I now have tried the Graco Clear Range monitor (it too has two recievers). I have tested it, and so far it is clear and there is no buzzing or static."
2,Very Static,"This monitor is aweful!!!!!All we hear when we turn it on is static. At first we thought our baby is moving an aweful lot, until we went into the room to find her snoozing quietly. There are all sorts of sounds coming from the monitor, including a conversation between another mother and her child !!The monitor is unbelievably loud and truly a waste of money.We cannot tell the diiference between just static and when she really moves, so everytime there is a noise we are up on our toes-what a pian and isn't this what the monitor is supposed to prevent??????"
3,A lot of static,Well my baby has 15 days and I bought this product because of the price...but it has a lot of static...it is not at all times or in all places. For example in my bedroom some nights has static and other not and in my other daughter bedroom the monitor works perfectly. I really do not know why but it is happening. I am going to give a couple of days but my husband is considering to return it.
4,Check your cordless phone if you have static problems,"For everyone who has trouble with static - if you have a cordless phone, it's MgHz could be interfering with the monitor. If the phone is running on the same frequency as the monitor, you will likely have buzzing or static problems. Just wanted to pass that along. Generally, the monitor will operate just fine when you eliminate in-home interference. If you live in an apt. or in a zero lot line neighborhood, the interference may be coming from your neighbor."
1,Terrible static,"I live in a condo and have cordless phones and wireless internet. I found this product had terrible static. In comparison, the Fisher Price 900mhz Long Range Monitor sounded excellent."
2,Lots of static!,"We enjoyed this monitor for a year until a neighbor w/ a baby moved in. Now, we have tons of static, and we can hear their baby crying on the other channel! At first, I thought maybe our monitor was getting old, so I bought a new model. That did not improve the situation at all. We have to turn down the volume so much at night because of the static that we can't hear our son crying. I'm giving up on this monitor. I would only recommend this monitor if you live in a rural area."
1,Don't waste your Money,"As most of the reviews here say, mine too had lots of statics and was noisy. For a little more money I bought a ""first years"" one and it was a world of difference."
2,Starts off fine but don't let that fool you!!,"After reading the reviews for this monitor, I registered for it anyway. Several people wrote things like ""Has some static but what monitor doesn't?""... I should have known right then I was in for trouble. We've had the monitor for 10 months now and it was fine at first but the longer we used it the more static it had. I went online and read the manual over and over to try and troubleshoot where my problem was. I tried EVERYTHING it suggested to no avail. In the last month the static has become so unbearable that I had the volume almost all the way down and I could bearly hear my daughter and I could STILL hear the static!! I went out and bought the Safety 1st Soft Glow monitor because all the reviews had 5 stars and now I know why - IT'S GREAT! It is so silent. I'd say go for that one!!"
2,Can't hear baby over interference.,"When I went to the store and saw this monitor, I had remembered buying it for a friend as part of her baby shower gift a few months back. I even recall asking her, after she had her son, if it worked good and she said that yes, it worked just fine. So, I thought, &quot;It's not expensive, it lights up, and it works great. Cool.&quot; So I bought it for myself. When I brought it home and set it up while my 7 month old daughter was sleeping last night, I was surprised that I could hardly hear her breathing over the constant &quot;ZZZZZZZZZZ&quot; sound coming over the monitor. I've tried both channels and have even tried setting it up in different places, but the interference is here to stay. On the box it says that this product has &quot;Crystal Clear Reception&quot;, but I have found that to be very untrue. So now I have to go back to the store and return it. Thank God I kept the receipt."
1,Not a good buy,This monitor got static no matter what channel and where it was in the house. I had it turned down so low I couldn't even hear my son's music right next to it and still got annoying static. Definatly not something you want right next to your head in the night.
2,"Like Features, but Static is a big problem","I've been using this monitor for 21 months now. I love that there are two receivers as I live in a multi-floor home. I love that it has lights to show the decibel levels.What I hate, and the reason I am getting a different monitor for my next baby is the horrible static! I've tried both channels to no avail.I called Fisher-Price. They said it was a problem with the AC adapter. They sent two new ones, but the problem remains. I notice it is much better when on battery power, but this chews through batteries so fast that it's not practical to use batteries all of the time.Overall, I think the monitor is well designed, and sturdy, however I hate having to listen to static every night all night long. Next time I will be trying a different product."
2,The biggest piece of crap!,"I bought this item before I had my daughter thinking it would be a great product. Boy was I WRONG! It hardly ever works on either channel, the static is defening. I have a better chance of hearing my daughter crying without the monitor on. The receivers will work in some rooms but not in other. If I could go back I would definitly pick something else. I am due to have another baby in a few months and I will definitly be buying a different brand of monitor, maybe I will be lucky and get one that works this time."
2,Too much static/feedback,"I am ready to buy new monitors. Not only have the receivers always had static and feedback but after less than a year use, the one contact for the receiver is bad. Depending on the position of the cord, the receiver disconnects and therefore, is not very helpful in monitoring my son. I really dislike the amount of 'white noise' both receivers produce. We have experimented with moving it to different outlets and different positions in our house and it is NEVER quiet."
1,static alert!,"We registered for these monitors, and then I noticed that a lot of the reviews claimed that they produced a lot of static, but I thought I would try them anyway.After we got them as a gift, we tried them out and found that they were indeed very staticy. We returned them to babies r'us and bought the sony monitor instead. Even though the sony came with only one monitor and was more expensive, it has a lot more channels and is a much better product. Well worth the couple of extra bucks.I would not recommend buying these!"
2,Tired of the fuzz!!!!,"We put this monitor on our registry and it was one of the first gifts we received. Like some of the other parents have described, there is always lots of static. It has a persistent ""white noise"". No matter what channel you choose, there is always static. It picks up every other noise in the house (the dishwasher, the toilet flushing) You name it!!! We can't get a clear, ""fuzzy-free"" reception to hear our little girl. Another thing that irritates me are the knobs used to turn the volume up and down. They are not finger-friendly-It is impossible to get a good grip. I would think twice about purchasing this monitor if I were you."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"We registered for this & received it at our shower. After setting it up we found there was a LOT of background static. After our son was born we had trouble hearing him over the static & that caused us to turn it up. This only caused MORE static. After 3 days, we took it back & got the Sony &quot;BabyCall&quot; monitor. It was more expensive, but WELL worth it! =)"
1,Terrible Sound Quality!,"We were very disappointed with this monitor. It has a constant background ""hum"" that is so loud it is difficult to hear the baby, and distracting when trying to watch TV or sleep. We returned it and bought the Sony 900 mhz, and are very happy with how quiet the Sony is."
1,Worked for a month,"The monitors were great when they were first purchased but after a month all we could pick up was static. We have moved the monitors from room to room, put them in different positions and still all we get is static, we can't even hear our baby when he cries. Eventually the static goes away and all you constantly hear is an annoying buzzing noise. I would recommend a different brand."
5,"Buttery, crunchy, salty medley","Clusters of popcorn, pecans and almonds, this decadent snack with a light crunchy consistency, and buttery aftertaste, is difficult to resist. The tasty blend of buttery brown sugar and salty undertones of this product is great for entertaining, in between meals, as well as a little treat for people above the age of 5.I don't recommend nut based products for young individuals due to the risk of aspiration or choking.It's dietary breakdown for a serving (1/2 cup) is as follows:150 Calories7 g of fat100 mg of Sodium19 g of carbohydrates2 g of ProteinFor those on some type of dietary restrictions, it contains the following:Milk, soy, almonds, pecans but may contain wheat.I highly recommend this."
5,Robbin' In Da Hood (Hysterically funny!!!),The movie trailer is HYSTERICALLY FUNNY! Some of my associates saw the sneak preview of the movie and loved it. They said it was one of the most hilarious comedies they've ever seen.LOTS OF LAUGHS!!!I believe it will out sale all comedies of its era.
3,Robbin' in Da Hood,I was quite disppointed with this movie. I thought it would be funny but I didn't find that in this movie.
4,INTEGRITY MATTERS,This is a good book with great ideas. The author touches on most of the necessary attributes necessary for becoming a success both in business and in your life. I enjoyed the personal feel of the book as the author takes us through his personal life as opposed to preaching what to do and how to do it. Enjoyable read.
1,Integrity takes many forms,"I also saw Karl Eller speak. He invited investment opportunities and I approached him after the session. He invited me to send him my business plan, which he would review. I promptly did so and heard no response from him for a number of weeks. I then followed up with a number of emails, all with read receipts simply asking for acknowledgement that he received the plan or to be referred on to someone else who may be interested. Initial emails were never responded to; concurrent emails with receipts were deleted without being read.If this is integrity in business communications, especially to a fellow entrepreneur, perhaps the concept is best left described by an individual more familiar with the concept."
1,Wrong color,"The Jug is very nice but I orded black not blue, did NOT get what I requested. They even show a picture of a blue Jug but black description."
1,Very disappointing,This is what is wrong with solder jewelry. Gaudy and silly. The book is black and white and illustrations are sketched? Don't bother.
2,EX-Z110 Camera doesn't fit,"This case has the rather critical drawback that our camera (EX-Z110) does not fit in it. The case is too small length-wise and the cover cannot be snapped shut. It is a nice looking leather case, but useless if you have this model (it may work fine for some of the other Exilim models)."
3,Just a Case,"It's a bit small for a Casio Camera. If it was just a bit bigger by a quarter of an inch, it would fit perfectly."
3,a bit too small,"I ordered this case for the casio camera I got for my daughter for Christmas. It came very quickly, even during the holidays. So I can honestly say that I was very pleased with the company I bought it from. However, the case is a bit too small for the camera it is supposed to fit! I can get it closed - if I stretch and strain! Since it is leather we are hoping it will stretch out a bit and get easier. Since it is so tight there is definitely no room to put anything in the small pocket."
4,Casio EX-CASE2 For Casio EXZ-1000,"Although I like the case very much and plan on keeping it, the strap opening on the top flap of this case does not line up with the new Casio EXZ-1000 camera strap fitting causing you to really have to tug to close the flap. I do like the extra size of this case for extra battery and SD cards."
1,The misleaded inforamtion of Casio Excase2 Leather Pouch,"This Casio Excase2 Leather Pouch showed misleading information for the buyers. First, the dimension was listed as 5"" tall, but if I put my Exilim Digital Camera into the pouch, I could not button it. My camera is only 3.5"" tall. However, the photo of this pouch showed a belt, but the actual product did not have a belt. I returned the pouch with such disappointing."
4,Perfectly Snug,"I am very satisfied with the fit and quality of this case. I have an Exilim EX-Z50. What I don't like is the relatively large pocket in front that makes it extra wide and adds too much bulk. A little unnecessary, I think. But other than that, good case."
4,Happy in Kuwait,I bought this case for the Casio EX-Z750 and I really like it. The camera fits perfectly and the leather will be sure to protect the LCD. The front pocket is perfect for the extra battery and a memory card and maybe a little cash to carry along with you. However there really isn't room to carry the usb cable with you. I had a bit of a delay with Dynadirect telling me it was in stock when it wasn't but the case itself is great. I give this case a very strong 4 star rating.
4,Does the job,"I bought this case for a Casio Exilim EXZ55. Likes: the small pouch on the front is just right to hold a spare battery and memory card. Dislikes: It is designed to hold a camera about 1/4 inch thicker, but it is not loose inside."
1,pouch did NOT fit!,The pouch did not fit the camera even though the two products were suggested matches. It was too small. It was apparant to me that pouch had already been returned by a previous customer as indicated by the Scotch tape to seal the wrapping back shut.
2,Great item.,Purchase this item for my wife at Christmas. She really thinks it is a great player. The sound that it puts out is great. Highly recommend. The shipment of this item was excellent.
2,Poor Customer Service,"The player itself is ok but the customer service and support at Samsung is the worst I have ever been through. After 5 phone calls, 10 disconnects, and over 10 hours on hold, they have promised for the fifth time they would get back to me. The player is supposed to come with 1 month of free downloads from your choice of three services. None of them will give you more than one week of free connect time and will still charge for each download. Samsung cannot seem to fix the problem and has an I do not care attitude. Avoid them and their products if possible."
3,Ugh...,"A friend of mine bought this for her husband as a gift and I got commissioned to load it with music since their computer does not have Windows XP. This was the first annoyance. Then, since I am an iTunes user and an iPodder, we had to load all of their music onto my computer in mp3 format into the Samsung Media Player thinking we would be able to make playlists only to find we could not. So, we then copied it over to WMP so that we could make playlists. Once we got all of the music into the little bugger we were all very impressed by the sound quality of it and had no complaints, but there are definitely more user friendly products on the market."
4,"OK, now for the rest of the story...","...I've been playing with my YP-K5 for a few days now. It is a cool MP3 player and is easy to use. I must admit though, that I'm some what disappointed with the sound of the speakers. I still own several of Philip's ShoqBoxs. Flash based Mp3 players with speakers. Sort of like little Bose radios. I can't count the number of people who've been totally blown away when they hear my ShoqBox. I could've sold a truck load of them myself and wonder why Philips has just abandoned this idea. The reason that I bought the YP-K5 was for the larger storage capacity and I hoped and thought (after reading several rave reviews here) that it would be better. It is a good rival to the ipod, but I wouldn't suggest that you buy it for the quality of the sound from the built in speakers. Very 'tinny'."
4,K5 player,"This K5 aka MP3 player stands up to expectations set by the manufacturers description. I experienced one problem, there isn't a way to charge the player in a wall outlet. This posed a problem while on vacation. The website stated charging took about 4 hours on a PC and 2 hours in a wall outlet. When I called Samsung I was told there is no outlet recharge connection nor do they see a date there would be one."
4,Mp3 player,"Sound is excellent.Slide in/out=not portable. Good for desk use because when you slide out it is not convinient any more.Skipping song is a little bit not straight forward. At first i thought I could not skip a song due to defective one. However, it turns out to be due to setting.I would not recommend this if portability is your priority. I would recommend this for sound if you are looking for something small with big great sound.I am dissapointed with my purchase because I can't put in my pocket when slide out (worry I would break it)"
2,random/shuffle problem,"Our daughter had a T-7 for a couple years but was ready for upgrade. We bought her a T10 for Christmas. Our son got a T9 last year and liked it so we figured the T10 would be even better. It seemed neat, had lots of nice options and sounds good BUT the big problem our daughter experienced was with the shuffle function. It played the same songs over and over in the same order and did not play all songs. We contacted Samsung in search of a solution for the malfunction but could not get support. Sent the T10 back and bought the YP-S5J which daughter thought was even cooler because of the speakers. It has the same random/shuffle malfunction. Always starts on same song and plays songs in same order. Does anyone have an idea how to correct the problem? If there is not a solution we will have to return this product."
4,Exceptional product,"This is an excellent, easy to use mp3 player. It is the size of a cell phone and may be too big for people who want to use it in a gym, but, otherwise, it is spectacular. The sound is great. It is just right for travel and normal listening situations. If the user wants to feel like he is at a rock concert, this is not the player. For everyone else, this should be a great device. Navigation is easy, and it syncs with Rhapsody very well."
2,defect in construction,"We liked this mp3 player for its size and the option of using the speaker without the headphones. Unfortunately though, there was a problem with the construction. There was a loose screw holding the top mp3 section and the bottom speaker section together that could not be tightened. Due to this problem the product was wobbly and was falling apart. We ended up returning it for a refund."
5,O-YES,Buy this K5 and you will be amazed how will the belt in speaker sounds and the FM radio works great.
4,samsung 4GB mp3 player,i am really glad with this player. i lovee it!! the only disadvantage is that it cannot play video and it is 4GB however it has many features i love. it has radio which is an important feature for me and you can view photos with it. it has a long battery life about 14 hours with headset and the most striking feature is its speakers. you will be amazed with the sound !!! really!! all of my friends ask what it is at the back and when i say they are the speakers they get amazed!! they are also thinking to buy one after they see mine!!
3,"Its the best little gaget ever but, It froze.","I had it for about an week and it started to freeze for no reason. Everytime i yurn it on, the volume goes down and then freezes on the music icon. There is no number to contact customer service so beware."
2,poor delivery,Simple enough part that fixed my door. Dealing with the company was not simple. Paid for expedited shipment but part didn't arrive as promised (and paid for). Emails to company went unanswered. DON'T BUY FROM THIS OUTFIT
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS SUPPLIER,I paid for expedited shipment on the product (1-3) day delivery. Over a week later I was still waiting. The company was totally unresponsive to my attempts at contacting them.STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,KUMBIA KINGS! Reeeeeeeeeemix!,"I was late in the game in finding the Kumbia Kings. I actually saw them for the first time on a commercial they did on TV. After hearing about 30 of thier music, I was hooked. I have been following them ever since. I recently saw them in Dallas, TX at the Texas State Fair where they put on a SPECTACULAR show! The Kumbia Kings can really rock that house and it was nice to see Selena's mom there also. One of the best songs performed was the remix on this album, Shhh! ( Borrashhho Mix ). Cane was awsome on the mic sitting on the side of the stage singing this song....KUMBIA KINGS! All other songs on this album are awsome, its good to hear how the mixed up some of the songs. If you ever get the chance to see them, GO! You will not be dissappointed!"

5,A Matrix Model Approach for Children With a Typical Behaviors,"Having accidentally killed another child when I was 6, I became a child that exhibited all of the signs of one most likely to become incarcerated. I found Dorothy's book an excellent example of many of the methods that actually saved me from killing myself/others or ending up istitutionalized for a very long time. Dorothy is an excellent writer and a very wise woman, I count it a blessing from God himself that she is also my mother!Sincerely,Mark D. Halla"
5,Great Family Movie,This is a great kid movie! Lots of action and funny lines! The kids do a great job and I hope there is more to come from these 3 little stars!
3,not good for 4 year old,"My 4 yr old grandson likes pirates so I thought this DVD might be ok. It actually is ok, but for an older group. Near the start, the dad gets in a fistfight with a 'robber' and gets a visible black eye. The youth in the story go live with relatives because the mom has died and it would be safer/better away from the home location.The DVD is very mild by normal standards and it would be great for an older audience, but it is too long (didn't hold his interest) and not good for the younger crowd."
2,Just short of XXX,"I have been a Cassie Edwards fan for years. This book was just short of being XXX. I thought that she also didn't keep to the story line as well as she always does. She writes very well normally, but this was a disappointment for me. I know that there are other books I will enjoy in the future. I did appreciate the historical information about the Suquamish and Hiada Indian Tribes, which is the only reason I am giving this book the credit of two stars, instead of a plain 0."
4,One of the better of Ms. Edwards' books,"I liked this book for the difference between this and other Savage books. I still had problems with the dialogue and use of ellipses - a common issue through her books - but I liked the story and how this story not only had Native Americans, but Chinese, and the main character Amelia spends some of her time in China after being kidnapped. However, Ms. Edwards should have done some more research because while overall the China parts were fun to read, I could tell that Ms. Edwards did a minimal amount of research for this. Still, it's one of the more interesting Savage books."
5,a good read,"I thought it was good with enough action to keep it moving. The beginning really laid out what happens in the rest. Dont be fooled by the bad reviews, Im glad i bought it."
1,Not even worth my .50 cents,"I hate to say this because I love Cassie Edwards' books, but this one was so bad. The storyline was just plain boring there was nothing to get into and a lot of chapters were a waste. First off the first eight chapters could have been summed up into a prolog. I also did not like all the secondary characters, there was so much about them it was a real turn off. It pained me to say bad stuff about Cassie Edwards' books but this one not even worth the .50 cents I paid for it."
2,The book was better,I will keep this simple. The movie was a good ride for special effects. The book was much better (aren't they always???) Smash your televisions and buy books.
1,A total hash of Heinlen's book.,"Based on Robert Heinlen's book, this is an insult to the man who is considered the greatest science fiction author of all time. The characters are unbelievable and the tactics are idiotic. How could these guys actually expect to win a war, anyway? Bottom line, this is the worst filmation of a book I've ever seen, beating even The Lost World Jurrasic Park."
3,Based upon the back cover of a novel by Robert Heinlein,"Let me start this by identifying myself as a serious Heinlein fan - that's where I'm coming from.This movie is not an adaptation of the novel - it's a satire/rebuttal of it. In this movie, Paul Verhoeven sneers at everything that Heinlein glorified, and he's not subtle at all about it. The heavy-handed ""military and war are bad"" theme does make it very hard to suspend disbelief for more than a few minutes at a time.That said, if you're looking for mindless entertainment, with plenty of action, nudity, sex, gore, and some pretty fair acting, it's not a bad ride - as much as I object to the message, the movie is still fun to watch. The sets and props are slick, the effects done well, and the actors do a fine job of exploring the characters, no matter how absurd the situations and motivations get."
4,Another dollop of Verhoeven weirdness,"""Starship Troopers"" is a bizarre combination of Paul Verhoeven weirdness, WWII propoganda film, cartoonish sci-fi...and a commentary on the dangers of fascism!Like ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"" Verhoeven successfully creates a world all his own. It could be the same world as ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"" where people are constantly the victims of malevolence - be it from man or machine. His usual trademarks are here: over the top violence tempered by nice little details and touches of humour. The actors are lightweights but this fits in with the cartoonish action.The special effects are mostly really good. The musical score is disappointing. ""Starship Troopers"" has a ""low-budget"", ""B-movie"" feel about it - not entirely to its disadvantage.The DVD commentary with Verhoeven and screenwriter Ed Neumeier is absolutely fascinating and well worth the price of the DVD."
2,Disappointing,"The above heading doesn't reflect my opinion of the film,but the Blu-ray its self,I love this film it's a typical American over the top action movie,but I love it,but I think this Blu-ray thing is a con designed to suck more money out of people,or maybe there is a difference if it's a new film and not a convert old film to digital and of course to see a real difference without scrutinising every minute detail with a magnifying glass you need a giant screen not my 27 inch one and very expensive equipment,so far I have bought 2 Blu-ray films and both are no better that the DVD versions except they cost at least twice the price of the older format,maybe as I only have a PS3 and a 300 computer monitor is the reason I can't see a difference,but I seriously doubt many people have the money to get the best out of the system,so from now on I will be saving my money buy buying DVDs instead."
1,THIS THING SUCKS!,"I have 3 different Blu Ray players (all less than a year old) and this thing won't play on any of them! I drove myself crazy trying to jump threw all the hoops they want you to including configuring firmware updates. As I read in the Blu Ray player reviews, YES it's a nightmare to configure a wireless set up to get firmware updates not user friendly at all.The bottom line is, by the time I got threw the last hoop Amazon said I couldn't return it cause I was out of the return period.I would stay away from this Blu Ray unless you are interested in a real expensive small Frisbee."
1,TERRIBLE !!!,"This movie is TERRIBLE !! In particular is a general with no guts, incompetent officers, over acting by everyone ... and they are all getting their asses beat by a giant MAGGOT!! What crap !! The effects are pretty cool, so if you are strictly into that, check it out otherwise save your money for another movie. The boxoffice spoke the truth. This one is forgettable !!"
1,"First ""Total Recall""","desecrated the memory of Philip K. Dick, and now this! Word of advice to the estate of Isaac Asimov and all other dead sf masters: if Verhoven comes snooping around, run! Run for your life!I can justify the 1 star instead of zero by virtue of the shower scene. Gratuitous nudity always makes me think a little more kindly toward a movie. As a whole, however, this film's intelligence level is aimed directly at people about 10 years too young to see it,"
3,"good movie, great DVD","This is one of the best DVD's around. Unlike some DVDs, this one utilizes all six audio channels actually sorrounding you in sound. Other DVDs don't use all six channels which makes the sound seem ""flat"" or not dimensional. The visual effects are awesome and warrant repeated veiwings. The plot is effective and the performances could be better, but those are minor points. These great special effect,sci fi types of movies showcase what DVD can do."
2,Fails to impress,"The film is very different from the rather dry book. Anyone who expects a moral lesson from the film will be disapointed: it's just about killing the enemy. Hence, the film includes much violence.The director has tried to bring some finer points across, though. To those who care to look a little bit deeper it will become evident that the government and the army aren't really the ""good guys"". In facts they are portrayed as fascists - evident for example from the soldiers' unfiforms which are nearly an exact replica of German uniforms during WW2. The stylized symbol of Earth Government also looks suspiciously similar to Germany's imperial eagle. But I guess such points are lost on 99% of the American audience (see the reviews above)."
2,Forget the Movie...Read the Book,"The book resonates with the ideals of loyalty, self-sacrifice and bravery, not to mention a system of enfrancising voters that this country could use today. The Movie is a disappointing collection of disjointed gratuitous violence, sex and insipid dialogue."
3,Double Sided!,We are about to enter the 21st century and I still have to get up in the middle of my film to flip the disk! This ruins the whole concept of the 'cinema' experience...Otherwise a really great movie.
3,Good & Goofy,This film is quite stupid as other reviewers have stated. But how could they not enjoy this film? Silly story of youths graduating from High School and joining military to save world from Giant Insects. Top notch special effects and everybody looks like a model.
3,Average movie but has great extra stuff,The screen tests for the actors are really great. The added scenes are mostly love scenes but are interesting.
5,A very cleaver flick - EXCELLENT !!,"Evey time I watch this movie I see it on a different level - almost like watching a new movie. Satirical - definitely! But also some serious social commentary on the true butality of war. I am always pleased when the concepts of nationalism and patriotism are shaken on their pedestals - It is allways a good thing to encourage people to think. I particularly like the trashy-teen-soapy style in several scenes which remind us of the abismal ignorance (why are we fighting?) that exist in our own society. I saw this movie as a anti-war film, with alot of tounge in cheek to boot. FUN STARS!"
5,Greadt movie/Great DVD,This movie is Great and the DVD has tons of extra features this one of my favorites.
1,Criminal,"A tolerable action movie worth viewing once. Otherwise it just goes to promogate the myth that Heinlein was a facist. For someone who has read the book, the director either refuses to get Heinlein's point due to personal issues on the subject matter or he is a truly dense individual."
1,nothing but cheese,"I serioulsly don't understand how anyone, specifically a previous reviewer, can say that this is the ""most realistic sci-fi"" they're ever seen. The whole permise is so stupid and unrealistic that i couldn't get past the first half without rolling my eyes many times over. Seriously, if we had ships that could reach other worlds and far more advanced technology than we do today, we would never send in a single troop to fight these things. All we'd do is send a few automated ships (no need for pilots) out there to drop a few massive nukes and we'd kill all traces of life on the planet within seconds. there'd be no need for a single person to die. dumb."
2,"Blu-ray version does not play even with external memory, ok on PS3 and PC","The two stars reflect the quality of the Blu-ray disc, not the movie itself, which I like.What kind of dumb arse made this disc? I can't believe it's actually a disc from Sony, the originator of the BD format. Do NOT buy the Blu-ray disc! It won't play in any BD player (even the newest ones), although some have had luck getting it to play with external memory (USB flash drive or SD card, 2GB or less) plugged in. I can't get it to play on any of my latest BD players, even with memory plugged in. This just sucks big time. Should have stuck with the DVD format.UPDATE: After writing the above it occured to me to try playing it on my PS3 and Sony BD-equipped PC. Voila, it played fine on both."
1,Loading Probs on a Panasonic!!!,"OK, Ive read the reviews and the probs, I currently own a Panasonic BD60 multi-region Bluray and multi-region DVD UK player. I just got Starship Troopers and was amazed to find even with a BD60 it still didnt load!!same as the rest of you guys.OK, so I gotta get an SD card right?my questions are, does there have to be any specific size for the card?are the cards all the same size to fit the slot?what size mem SD card do I get?thanks :)ps. its VERY poor that Sony dont mention this, VERY POOR."
5,"""I'm Doing My Part"" ~ Lets Kill Bugs!","Join Rico (Casper Van Dien), Dizz (Dina Meyer), Carmen (Denise Richards), Zander (Patrick Muldoon) and Carl (Neil Patrick Harris) and the rest of the gung ho Troopers in this futuristic, sci-fi, action/adventure, surreal allegorical tale of intergalactic warfare between mankind and giant bugs. The '97 film `Starship Troopers' excels in every category; special effects, action, originality, dialogue and anything else you can think of. There's nothing else like it, so ""Do your part' and get the popcorn ready for the wildest ride through the galaxy one could imagine.Note: The film contains extreme violence and some nudity so you may not want to include any little ones in on this one."
2,go bugs,"Go Bugs, the humans deserve to die.It's a lousy Sci-Fi movie.A really bad movie all in all.So bad I was rooting for the Bugs and I HATE bugs. (espessaly cockroaches)The only, only saving grace is the fact that I have not read the book and have no facts to compare. and that the Special Effects where awsome.Why isit that the really GOOD Sci-Fi storys(out side of books) only show on TV?..."
2,2 Stars For Dina Meyer in the Shower.,You people giving this a lengthy and thoughtful review have too much time on your hands. This film? Jocks in space. Sci-Fi for dummies. Hokey special effects. Melrose Place level acting. Dougie Howser in space. Denise Richards looks great. But after watching this it occured to me that that is what she is really famous for... but she is not in the shower scene that everyone was buzzing about either. This is a silly film about earth in the future having to send the military into space to fight giant arachnids that want to snack on homo sapiens. It plays like a tv movie right from the start with a little bit of nudity and extra gore thrown in. But essentially this is a guilty pleasure that will never be in the same category as Star Wars or ET.
1,A dog of epic proportions,"That this movie even has the same title as the great book is in bad taste. Poorly acted with a screen play and dialogue which causes one to feel like a small furry animal stuck in a trap, ready to chew its own leg of in order to escape, this movies only redeeming quality is that they waited for Robert Heinlein to pass away before wasting the celluloid."
5,Starship Troopers,Starship Troopers is a wonderful movie though no where near as good as the book. The Book is a must read.
5,Starship Troopers First Rate!!!,"This is a great change of pase from all the other Sci fi out there. When I first saw the adds for the movies release I said ""not a chance!"" But I was persuaded by a friend to go see it and I'm glad I did. This movie has it all. A great story,A great plot. And Fantastic special effects! They are flawless when seen in the theater. But some of the effects are obviouse at home. None the less it's a Fantastic film!! Another great bonus is that there is very little swearing in the movie. For an R rating this is a wonderful plus. It makes the movie that much more enjoyable. So I highly recommend it to one and all.Enjoy!"
3,"Entertaining, sarcastic yarn.","This film might have failed if it had tried to be serious. Instead of meanders from teeny-bopper to dark comedy without really losing itself too much. At times it seems to make fun of other sci fi works with aliens and excessive ""gooeyness,"" and at other times it seems to be frantically paced and reminiscent of bad action films - in a good way.Do not see this expecting a serious sci fi film, or even a serious space opera. Instead, expect a humorous parody of both."
4,Starship Troopers,It's an interesting movie I like to watch every now and then I had been looking for it on other websites and I prefered getting it on Amazon. I buy most of my school supplies from Amazon as well.
3,2 different comment,"The movie is indeedly NICE and NOT NICE! The nice part are the effects. The Not Nice part is the acting and talking. Although many like the movie, but many don't. The movie is only for those who like BLOODY scene. I'm lucky because I'm half half. The effects are DAMN good, maybe as good as StarWars, but the problem is, the movie is Very, very bloody. Anyway, good try."
2,S*cks.,"If you've never read the book, the action and some of the dialogue are somewhat entertaining. If you have read it, you'll most likely be pretty dissapointed with the movie. Either way, you've got some really attractive people (and their bodies, of course) to look at--so I guess it's not a TOTAL loss (hence the TWO stars, instead of one)."
5,One of the best films ever!,"Starship Troopers is fantastic. Don't believe those political-correctness-people who say it's fascist, militant or dumb. It mocks fascism and makes fun of the military the same way 'Aliens' did - by letting those pretty boys & girls become nothing more than alien-fodder. Despite their 'mighty' weapons. It's a highly intelligent movie (perhaps too intelligent for the average US-movie-goer who is below 20 years old) and far away from the mainstram-crap that was 'Lost in Space'. Starship Troopers belongs to the best sci-fi ever. Only the Star Wars trilogy, 2001, Aliens and the Fifth Element can compete. And the DVD? O.k. you have to swap it to see the special features - but that's the only drawback. The trailer is definitely the best trailer of the 90's - and already worth the money. Buy it!!"
4,Should have won Academy Award for Animation. Very unique.,Read the book as a kid. Was teased by the long lead time teasers (just like Fantastic Four). Got my kids interested. Was one of very few people to actually see the movie in the theatre. Most visually memorable scene in the movie was when Mike Ironsides peers over the top of quick fab fort to see onslaught of bugs. Fun for the entire Science Fiction family. Soap Opera style romance for the ladies and bug action for the rest of us. Eagerly awaiting the sequel! Not for younger kids with all the horrific bug and sexual equality action.
1,Can I give less than 1 star???,"If you enjoy movies that repeat the same events over-and-over again, you'll LOVE this one! The first human assault takes place entirely with ground-troops, who consequently wind up being slaughtered (hadn't they heard of ""air-support""?). It is this, first assault when the human forces also discover that the ""bugs"" can attack their ships in orbit. So what do they do for the second assault? Send more ships into orbit (where they're promptly picked-off left-and-right), and send in ground troops again! Any military force that operated in such an IGNORANT manner would DESERVE to be annihilated. (I won't even bother mentioning the rest of the movie's faults, as I'm limited to 1,000 words or less.)From reading the other reviews, I realize this was supposed to be satirical; unfortunately, I only found it to be stupid. (This is from a person who LOVES Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy!)"
1,Hey Verhoeven! Stop making movies!,"Just when you thought that ShowGirls was the lowest the industry could ever sink, Verhoeven pulls something even worse out of his.....pocket. I am fed up with directors who believe they can ignore everything that makes a movie worth watching so long as they feed us mindless special effects, skin, and gore. Every no-talent actor in this movie needs to go back to the 90210 set they walked off of. And who is the idiot who cast Doogie Howser as a secret intelligence agent. The only thing entertaining about this piece of garbage was that the plot, characters and setting were so stupid it was all FUNNY. I would pay real money to see this thing spoofed on Mystery Science Theater 3000."
1,misses the whole point of book,"I don't write reviews normally, but this is an awful movie. My daughter ( age 12) had just finished reading the book. I had also read the book to my son ( age 9). Both had liked the story and wanted to see the movie. We did and walked out in horror. Nothing in this movie is right! The troops in the book had full combat suits. The soldiers in this movie had about as much armor as a policeman. The tactics in the book were fast in/out types. In the movie they acted more like they were playing capture the flag. Finally the whole lesson of citizenship and honor were plowed under. I love the book and have an insane hope that someone will make a movie of it that focuses on the story, not the effects. In movies like Star Wars and Aliens the effects were good, but the story is what made them special.I cared about Luke or Ridley. This movie just trashes the story."
3,It stands alone its not Heinlein,"While I am proud to see some of his books made into movies, myself as an avid Heinlein collector finds fault with the straying from the storyline.As a standalone picture I enjoyed it, but it was not to me Heinlein's vision in the book he wrote. The focus on family was taken aside to focus on some girl, the focus of maturity was made to be a coming of age item and love interests.Don't get me wrong I like the film, but it was not Robert Heinlein's book."
5,Delicious mind candy - and better than the book,"I watch movies to be entertained, not have my consciousness raised, and this film delivered. The B movie flavor made me feel as if I were 10 again, checking out the latest fare at the neighborhood theater. Believe it or not, there were other great science fiction movies before ""Star Wars,"" and this captures the fun, wonder, and ""gee wiz"" special effects (expanded for the more demanding viewers, of course) from 40 or 50 years ago. If you are looking for some profound message, go elsewhere. If you want to suspend Real Life for a couple of hours, come on board!"
1,This Movie SUCKS!,"This is the worst movie ever. Don't rent it! Save your money and yourself! The only good thing was the bugs. The acting is BAD, and WHY did they put Denise Richards in it...in any movie for that matter! What's with the whole Nazi thing? And are the nude scenes really necessary? The story is SO unrealistic! I suggest reading the book and watching the TV show! They're both way better. The movie doesn't even deserve one star!"
1,The worst movie ever made?,"Bad. Hated it. Hated it. Really hated it. If it had been done with deft humor, it could have been really funny (maybe), but the film takes itself so seriously that it isn't even laughable as a campy B movie such as Plan 9. The big ""smart bug"", the pseudo-science, the psychobabble/esp stuff is just too barfy. The WWII movie bootcamp and combat scenes come across not as campy nor as ""making a social statement"", but as just plain corny at best or ""gag me with a spoon"" at worst. This is, I believe, the worst movie I've ever seen. Doesn't deserve even one star."
1,Couldn't have been worse,"One of the Worst Movies that I have ever seen. The acting was some of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing.Like wen the main character (forget his name) said in anger: ""The infantry does the dying, the fleet does the flying!""It was so fake that I almost threw something at my TV.The movie had a good idea and apparently a good book behind it, but it was so poorly executed it was painful. I was really hoping that it would be a good movie but WHOA! what a stinker!"
3,mmmmm,"I bought a used copy and it did not come in the DVD case that they display on the Starship Troopers page. If I buy it again, I hope it comes in the cool case they show on the page."
1,"West Point should call it ""How To Lose A War 101""","I regretted paying American money to see this bloodbath. It started out as some sort of World War Two-style film and quickly devolved into Vietnam. I counted at least 8 different ways for people to die. The coed shower scene was totally unnecessary. One thing really bugged me (no pun intended): if the Bugs were these ten-foot-tall spider aliens that were basically a cross between a scorpion, a ""Jurassic Park"" velociraptor, and an M-1 tank, why are the humans shooting at them with bullets fired from guns that are basically an M-16 grafted to a pump-action shotgun?Do NOT buy or see this film unless you have a high threshold for gratuitous gore."
4,where to start?,"This one has it all. Action,thrills and plenty of blood and gore. Fans of the genre will definitely get a kick out of this movie."
2,Special Effects do not a movie make,"This is a story about a pseudo-fascist future earth that is retaliating against a race of giant bugs. Following the role of some high school students, we track the course of the war in the Space Fleet, in the Marines and the intelligence... The plot revolves around....Oh never mind. You don't watch this movie for the plot. You watch this movie for the incredible special effects, giant man eating space bugs, gore and rather pointless nudity. Hmmm.... I can see a problem here.I did not find this movie all that appealing - the acting was bad, the plot obvious. The special effects do deserve a thumbs up as does the concept of this future earth - the propaganda videos are actually quite interesting. Overall this movie is probably best enjoyed after the consumption of large quanities of alcohol - maybe then the bad acting and camp predictability won't detract quite so much from the overall effect.I would recomend most science fiction movies over this."
3,Uh...yeah...,"This is a cool movie, don't get me wrong. But, it carries nothing of the book. None of the socio-political undertones, nothing. It barely even carries any sort of an us vs. them tone. Its pretty much just a movie about killing bad guys."
4,This movie was great.,I really enjoyed this movie. It's brainless fun and good to watch more than once while you're working and such. Funny as all hell as it's a satire of old war propaganda. The effects are top notch. Still some of the best even after I've seen the LOTR movies.
1,IHATE THIS MOVIE!,"This is the worst movie ive ever seen,and I men every word of it. The acting sucks, and that particular violence is not entertaining. Still if you're an older man who hates children, and like to see them get ripped to pieces, then you can take you're sick sorry ass to see this awful movie."
2,Not the book,"I first read ""SST"" in grade school, not so many years after the book was published. I loved the book then and love it now. But I cannot say the same of the movie. A great many Heinlein and SF devotees eagerly awaited the film based on the naive expectation that the movie would resemble the book. But the director said publicly after reading all of 40 pages, ""This is not the film I want to make."" Well, he should have made something else.It's regrettable that Heinlein's estate signed with Verhoeven. Apart from the near absence of the book's philosophical basis, much of the ""factual"" aspects are lacking: Skinnies are absent; Bugs excrete their own highspeed plasma (or something) into space; no bio-mechanicals; on & on.Despite the many lapses, this is an enjoyable film to watch. By that, I mean ""To Look At."" The leading characters are extremely cinematic; Denise Richards is an absolute Babe; Caspar gets girls glassy-eyed.And that's about all you can say for SST: The Movie."
3,Good looking film,"This is one of those films that as long as you're not looking for much of a plot, you'll do fine. I really liked the idea behind it, though. It was interesting to see the director's version of a future fascist state. The look of the bugs is kinda cheesy, though. And I think the dialogue is scarier than the bugs ever were.Still, it works pretty good as a popcorn DVD movie that doesn't require a lot of thought."
1,just will not play in my machine,"this bluray will not play in my Sony BDP-S370 player. I tried 2 discs same result disc loads up and freezes, very frustrating never saw a problem like this with any other bluray title."
2,"campy, crappy, and cataclismic","This is the epitome of a special-effects driven nightmare. If there is a story, it's a very understated one, but the move is ""colorful"" and mildly entertaining. The FX are mind boggling, but the ""feel"" of th movie was too idiotic for me to give it more than 1 star, but the fact that Dina Meyer and Denise Richards were in it makes the movie watchable. Other than that, the movie was bad in my opinion."
1,AWFUL movie`,"I am a devoted science fiction fan, and, having read the book twice, I can say that this is a TERRIBLE movie. The attitude of the army is quite the opposite of the attitude of Heinlein's army. The powered armor is missing, the troops disobey orders on a whim (Which Heinlein's army NEVER would've done), and the main character's friends mostly survive to the end! Do NOT see this."
1,Only a dead Melrose Place Star is a good Melrose Place Star,"This movie is probably the dumbest one of all time, well perhaps Rambo III and Godzilla are even worse .... And this outer-space trash from the director of two science-fiction cult classics called ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"". Verhoeven should be ashamed of having directed this nonsense. And to say one or two words about the ""cast"" I can only add to my embarassment that this movie contains no acting at all. The only good scenes throughout the movie are the ones` when these awful ""Beverly Hills""-teenagers are torn apart by the bugs, Hurray ....! Even the climax doesn`t work ..... Everyone who calls this movie a masterpiece deserves to be eaten by an alien-bug."
1,Find the Original Book,"This movie doesn't do justice to the original book written by: Robert Heinlein. Thought I would enjoy the movie, but was a waste of time. I'd rather read the original book, not the screenplay movie book."
3,"Good but not a ""classic""","Wherein the special effects wizardry take center stage in this ""big bug"" tale, that alone does not come close to matching the greatness of true sci-fi films like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""The War of the Worlds,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" or even ""Planet of the Apes."" I really feel that the film deserves a ""3 1/2"" rating!Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, and the rest of the ""pretty"" cast have a few more roles to log under their belts before one can take them seriously as thespians.For one into the technical aspects of Hollywood moviemaking, the film is a winner.For someone who wants an intriguing story about monster insects, stick with ""Them!"""
3,Good in a different sense,"Granted, the movie was very unrealistic and in fact put the novel to shame (the novel being an excellent story) I would like to view this movie as less of a Hollywood-era fire-and-forget sci-fi flick and more of an analyzation of propoganda and fascism illustrated on the human's part. Look closely and you might just see the similarities it bears to Nazi Germany during World War II. For those of who who are interested in this kind of thing, Starship Troopers is worth a rental. For those of you looking for a unique addition to the sci-fi war universe...keep hunting."
3,It was a great ride!,ok! so it isn't the best scrip in the world.. But the story will hold just enough to get you to the action.. this is not a big movie for thought but it is a fun ride!
4,"Broad, Entertaining Satire From The Folks That Brought You ROBOCOP","Well, there's a pretty simple litmus test as to whether you'll enjoy this film or not: if you enjoyedRobocop, director Paul Verhoeven and screenwriter Edward Neumeier's previous collaboration, you'll probably get a kick out of this one, too. All the same elements that distinguish that work mark STARSHIP TROOPERS: blackly comic satire disguised as mindless sci-fi action, omnipresent ultra-violence, send-ups of American TV ads, etc. Not to everyone's taste, I'm sure, but those who appreciate Verhoeven's distinctive sensiblity should have a blast. Also recommended to fans of comics creator Frank Miller's (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,Give Me Liberty (Martha Washington Series), etc.) work, and vice versa."
3,PURE PULP FUN,"Paul Verhoeven makes thrillers that are insidiously entertaining, they smash you in the face with their nervy visuals and often silly dialog. This movie is no exception; however, it also boasts a mesmerizing parallel to the recruitment films used in Nazi Germany. It has that austere, spare, let's go to war for all the right reasons feel to it. The cast is impossibly gorgeous and cut, much like Hitler youth as fashionable teens in outer space. The special effects are nerve-jangling and robust; this is a grade-B movie with some high gloss. For the best Paul Verhoeven film ever, see if you can find The Fourth Man, which is in Dutch -- it has the same wildly concocted imagination as this sci-fi thriller, but it also has brains."
4,90210 Goes to War!,"This is one of those films that plays better on video (or in this case, DVD) than it did at the movie. The novel by Heinlein was much better, but it was written back in the 1950s, so Verhoven did need to update it for the 1990s. The DVD version is quite clean and has some nice extra features.Interesting aside: I used to babysit Anthony Ruivivar (when he was about six years old) who plays Shishumi. He's the first soldier to get killed by the bugs."
3,Visually appealing with little plot,"I was left wishing plot and characters had as much time put into them as visual effects and general look of film. Not sure if the dialog and politics were on purpose or not, the movie can entertain but will not make you think much."
4,It takes courage to make a '50's sci-fi movie in the '90's,I loved this movie on several levels from its cornball script to its dazzling CG bugs. What a surprising and wonderful gift to have a book I loved as a teenager brought to the screen as it could never have been done until now with all of the '50's sensibilities(?) intact. Hats off to those who made this possible.
3,Needed big name stars,"Hey! Come on, folks. It's not that good and it's not that bad. This movie needed big name stars. Micheal Ironside is the closest thing we get to a star. You've got to love the bug attacks! You know what you're getting when you go to a movie like this. It's not deep-seated philosophy like another popular sci-fi movie series tries to fake. Naw! This is action-adventure pure and simple. Too violent? Way too much. Silly? Preposterously so. Entertaining? Certainly. And there is a message or two about how effective propaganda can be. Want to know more?"
1,Pathetic acting with too much gore and violence,"The camera views are horid, the special effects too overdone, the actors are practically reading their lines. Only children might think it real, however it has far too much violence, blood and gore to be acceptable material for any younger viewing audience. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Heaven protect us from Verhoeven!,"Woodenly acted, the model mannequins have escaped from Baywatch and put on space-suits. I challenge anyone to care about the characters, including the actors portraying the roles. There was no commitment from anyone, with the possible exception of the CGI artists, who obviously spent a lot of time on this film - possibly to put together a portfolio reel. I'm not even sure Verhoeven cared, since the sense I got from the film was he was completing a three-picture contract deal by going half-hearted at this one.There are any number of really good science fiction flicks out there that examine the heroism, god, and country attitude missing from this dud. I suggest passing over this one in the vid-store, and changing the channel if it ever appears on TV."
4,A great and troubling movie....,"In my travels through some of the world's better universities, this movie actually was mentioned in lectures twice. The first time I head of it was in the U.S. when one of my professors called it a ""Nazi movie"" and said that the only thing he could really do was identify with the bugs, that they were ""so cute with their little pincers..."" The second time was in an ethics course in Britain when it was to be watched as a study on militarism.And strangely, it sufficed in this role. This is one haunting movie. The human race gets all bent out of shape about fighting bugs.... society becomes warped because of an outside threat.... Obviously, this movie speaks on oh-so-many-levels, which is really something for a movie about a bunch of twentysomethings leaving off to fight bugs.....I love this movie (though, for my little Buddhist professor, it is a Nazi movie...) because it is so deep for something so shallow. And fun to watch...."
4,"Guts, blood and bugs","A good film will never take itself too seriously. A good film will remind you that you are watching a film, not a slice of reality. In most respects, this makes it all the more fun to watch. Troopers is the epitome of tongue-in-cheek.Troopers never, ever, ever takes itself seriously. And it does it well. It's funny because it's ridiculous, because it's so... gross. You feel for the characters because they're so blatantly two-dimensional. You care about them.I mean, come on. Massive bugs that want to destroy humanity? Hardly an original set-up for a film. Throw in some megabudget CGI, some rather weak actors, a shower scene and LOTS of fake blood, this could have been a huge flop. But because it was tongue-in-cheek all the way through, because it acknowledged its own absurdity, Troopers has become a cult classic. Even if nobody 'gets' the satirical undertones, it's a fun film that's fun to watch, with lots of nice gory action sequences."
4,Not as good as the novel but good enough,"Starship Troopers with its graphic violence, beautiful actors, is a satire on fascism. Paul Verohoeven is a creative director, not since Robocop has the director mixed black comedy, graphic violence, and his personal views on our society and yet he made another extremely entertaining movie. I will admit this isn't an A+ on believability, but it is still very entertaining. Rated R for graphic violence, gore, nudity, sexual content, and some language."
1,"truly awful (or should I say ""offal"")","I am an admirer of the Heinlein novel and Verhoeven's ROBOCOP, but I was utterly disappointed with this movie. I expected to at least enjoy it on it's ""entertainment"" factor, alas, there wasn't one. Being quite a cinema-lover, I was surprised to find no value at all in this work, and I would rate it a ""0"" if that were an option. If you want entertainment, see LOST IN SPACE instead."
1,"Fascist or patriotic? Regardless, it was PUKEY BAD!","Plot: bad. Dialog: bad. Believability: bad. Acting: tolerable. Redeeming qualities: none. If I could give this movie a zero-star rating, I would. I'm usually a fan of science fiction movies, even the mediocre ones, but I found myself actively mocking the screen after mere minutes. The characters were paper-thin, the message was indecipherable, and the plot was laughable. Infantry with bullets against a torrent of virtually-unkillable aliens? Butt-blowing bug baddies whose comet-like projectiles escape the planet's gravity well and knock out huge battleships? Gimme a break! How many dismemberments do we really need to see, anyway? The cheese-factor was too much for me, and I'm from Wisconsin, the Dairy State! And how come the residents of Buenos Aires were so...so...white? RA Heinlein, the author of the book upon which this trash was (loosely) based, must be spinning in his grave."
2,The combat strategy makes no sense!,"The best part of this movie was the shower scene! Who in their right mind would send Infantry troops into hard-to-hand combat with the superior-sized bugs. That's what artillery, smart bombs, cruise missiles, and nuclear weapons are for. A needless waste of lives, done only to maximize the gore."
1,"Good effects, non-existent story line, plot for pre-teens","I hated this movie, and I really like science-fiction and visual effects. It is horribly incongruous to show huge, sophisticated space ships far in the future, then show men fighting giant spiders with guns that appear to have the power of .22 rifles. It takes hundreds of shots to kill the spiders, which mean humans get ripped up a lot in this film. I was also irritated at the adolescent jump to nude shower seens, idiotic story line of love between soldiers, plastic one-dimensional characters. Some folks here have written glowing, five-star reviews of this movie...there's no accounting for taste, as they say, but they must be pre-teenagers who were drunk when they saw the movie, jumping up and yelling with glee as someone's arm got torn off and blood went everywhere. This is only the second of hundreds of videos I've rented that I turned off the video before finishing it."
1,A likely candidate for Mystery Science Theater 3000.,"A sci-fi thriller of ugly bad actors, exterminating BUGS. A graphic VOMIT scene will send this film across the room, hitting the wall with a shaterring bang. A few decapitations here and there, people being spliced in half. I hate when films compare themselves with Star Wars. Leave Star Wars alone, and go to acting school. I can't wait to see this film on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I compare this film with SPACE MUTINY-:)"
1,"Expected gold, got lead","How truly, truly disappointing. I thought I would be watching an intelligent look at war in space and all I got was a smorgasbord of squished bugs and stupid people. Some folks actually seem impressed with the so-called antiwar message of the film, which is about as subtle and convincing as Marvel comics trying to teach philosophy with the Incredible Hulk. Putrid crap, from a director who ought to know better."
1,"So very, very bad...","If you're hoping for anything like the classic novel, skip this turkey. It can't decide if it wants to be slapstick, satire or gung-ho. The acting is dreadful, the writing is worse. Skip it!!"
5,Worth buying even if you own the original DVD,"Compared to the single disc original DVD, this new 2-disc set adds a half hour documentary and another commentary track with three of the actors from the film. In addition, the transfer on the new version is significantly better than the original. It's definitely on par with Superbit releases. While it may look a tad grainier than the original, you can see added detail. On a large projection TV it's definitely noticeable. So if you're a big fan of the film, I totally recommend picking up this new version.Also, the new commentary track with Casper van Dien, Dina Meyer, and Doogie Howzer is just hilarious. Director Verhoeven is on it, too, but he mainly keeps his mouth shut and lets the actors talk about lots of funny anecdotes."
1,Won't play without memory card- and an editing error,"As many reviews have already pointed out, this U.S. region 1(A) blu-ray will not play without the addition of an SD memory card. Criminal that Sony did not recall this problem disc. I contacted Sony Home Entertainment, and was offered an exchange. Send in my new disc with all the packaging, and receive a new disc with all the packaging. The let down occured when the customer service person could not tell me the replacement disc would play without additional external memory, or even that the editing problem (reported to be during the outpost battle scene) has been fixed. I for one do not have a memory card lying around that I can insert into my player just to watch this movie. Time to punt. Amazon was super about accepting my opened item return for credit.Now for the solution:Purchased the UK version blu-ray (region free) for an excellent price on amazon.co.uk. Plays great. No editing problem. Great movie to own on blu-ray. Extremely happy."
3,"Sci-fi action galore, Little on story and acting","This is the we call a 'turn-off your brain and enjoy' movie. The action is set at break-neck speeds, while keeping some sort of story. The computer graphics are stunning and it seems that it was supposed to make up for the terrible acting of Casper Van Dien. I don't know about the book and its resemblence to it, but its a great action filled movie with enough gore to rival Saving Private Ryan."
1,A major disappointment,"Starship Troopers was one of my favorite books from High School and I was looking forward to the movie. This has got to be the worse adaption of a Sci-fi book since David Lynch's butchering of Dune.God, where to start? A B-list cast of no talent mannequins, satrirical commercials that are a rip off from Robocop, but seem jarringly out of place, an awful script (yeah right, bug farts from a planet light years away cause an asteroid to destroy Brazil), and a futuristic army that basically isn't any better armed (or armoured) than any 20th century third world nation.The bugs are cool, though."
1,Complete Crap,"The polar opposite of the book in so many ways - from the political themes to the weapons and combat.The combat scenes are a terrible joke. I'd like to think that if we can transport troops to other planets, we could arm them with something better than 1970's vintage 5.56 rifle. And, maybe arrange for a few mortars or artillery. Oh yeah, day one of Infantry School - DON'T BUNCH UP! An LA street gang would use better tactics.Just an awful movie based on one of the greatest military sci-fi books ever written."
3,Once a fan,"I've lost faith in director Paul Vorhoeven. Not only was his last flick a complete disappointment (Hollow Man) but the commentary he makes through the supplementary audio track on this DVD is rather tepid...if even that. It is clear that Mr. Vorhoeven has focused on what this film is technically rather than what could be used as a means to explain what his directorial thoughts behind the film were. It is, instead, left to Mr. Neumier to unpack and explain the film's underlying themes of facism and social commentary (which HE does very eloquently I might ad). Don't get me wrong, I still like this movie very much and am not at all dissapointed in my purchase. However, I feel that Mr. Vorhoeven's emphasis on what shots are digital and what is live and what other family member of his is involved seems a far cry from the insight given by Mr. Neumier."
3,Read the book,"Starship Troopers was a decent movie. Most people may not have not liked the movie, but don't let that influence your views on the book. The book was one Robert Heinlein's masterpieces. Most of the movie was a bug shoot-em-up, but the book was a deep look in the political system of the future and what it takes to make a good citizen."
1,This is one of the worst movies ever made,"This movis is terrible. It's plot seems to be aimed at three year olds but it so violent it would give them nightmares. I don,t know what kind of target audiance they were aiming at."
1,"No Suits? Verhoeven, you blew it.","At first pass, a fun flick. After re-reading the book after seeing it (my fifth time reading the novel), I realized how much it sucked. The only two saving graces were the JOHN RODGER (nice ship design) and the visualization of the bugs. Otherwise, a complete waste of time."
2,Two Stars For The Eye Candy,The rest of the movie needed some help. By all means READ THE BOOK. It is much deeper and tells a more involved story. You also get to read about the Skinnies. I happened to read the book before seeing the movie and there is no comparison. Skip this film and READ !
1,Doogie Mania!,"Oh that's just great! Real smooth! Thanks to some television mini-series we've seen Doogie the pyromaniac. We've seen Doogie the wicked French King. Now thanks to this flick We've seen Doogie the nazi. Hey, Verhoeven! Where's his buddy Vinny?"
1,Absolutly STUPID!!!!!!!!!,"This is by far, the worst science fiction, supposedly kids movie I've ever seen. The acting is stupid, the bugs are stupid, man, the whole movie is stupid. I'm suprised it got 3 and a half stars, or any stars at all. It is filled with pointless F and MF words and gore. Like I said, ""STUPID!!"""
2,Action and violence packed science fiction,"If you go for action and violence you'll probably like this movie. On the other hand, if you think plot and acting are important, you better look elsewhere. This is one of the most violent popular movies I have seen."
1,Verhoeven shows no respect for a great story.,"It is apparent that the director, Paul Verhoeven, has little respect for Robert Heinlein. He butchered a great and controversial story, and left us with a disaster of a film. Please don't bother watching this film. I do encourage you to read the book by Robert Heinlein. Even if one doesn't agree with Heinlein, he does cause the reader to think deeply about important matters, such as, ""What is a just society.""Verhoeven's film doesn't encourage one to think. I wonder if Verhoeven read the book since the story in the film bears little resemblance to Heinlein's novel. For example, Heinlein valued public service. I can't tell what Verhoeven values except for indulgence.I would give this less than one star if possible."
3,death to all alien bugs,"this one packs a wallop but some things are way to dumb. the aliens are top notch and way to many to kill. the battles are awesome and the cast is lively. the part where the head alien sucks the brains from his victims is gooey and fun and Casper Van Dien(Sleepy Hollow, Python), looks like he had a good old time riding that bug."
1,Good Looks and Little Else,"This movie is all about looking good and little more as far as I am concerned. However, amazing special effects can't save what is a pretty awful movie. I won't go into the plot because it isn't worth it. It's just stupid. The acting is pathetic. Sitting through the entire 2+ hours of this movie was a test of endurance for me.This movie was major disappointment, especially given the very favorable reviews I've read on Amazon. I love science fiction and Paul Verhoeven's other sci-fi movies (Robocop, Total Recall, Hollow Man). I can't believe this is the same director. Man did this movie suck!"
2,High Tech Trash,"You might appreciate this film for outstanding special effects, superb sound and picture quality inspite of it's bad script and political correctness."
1,Incredibly stupid!!!,Single handedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Don't waste your money!
1,rip off of the book,"The nazification of Carl,the human ""swarms"",and the 90210 theme of the story turned a book about service and duty into an antimilitary film. John Milius would have done justice to the Heinlein story."
1,Heinlein would weep,"The only description that truly does this movie justice is AWFUL! That is the most polite word I can use in this forum. To have ruined one of Robert Heinlein's most wonderful novels in this way makes me positively ill.I loved the book, hated the movie. Perhaps the director should have bothered to READ the book before he attempted to make the film."
5,Van Dien,Two words...Shower Scene!Not to mention the awesome action! One of the best sci-fi films ever made.
5,A great sci fi movie,The advertising to join the military reminds me of Uncle Sam Wants You of the forties. The hype to join the service makes the youth of the world think its all fortune and glory. But then the ugly reality begins with the mobile infantry. Brilliant depiction of Heinlein's story.
4,Awesome movie.,"Huge fan of Heinlein but never read this book. The movie is still amazing; after many viewings, I still love it."
1,"Can you say ""special effects""?","There are two basic schools of thought on Starship Troopers (the film): those who saw it for the special effects (5 stars) and those who came for the story (-5 stars). In a nutshell, these are the most oft-recurring scenes (in that order): man getting shot in the head; people making love; people getting eaten by giant insects; people destroyed by interstellar asteroids; people getting shot by insect excrement out of orbit(those bugs have awfully good aim); more dead people; people whose brains are sucked out by a ""Brain Bug"" (actually referred to as such in the film). The book focused on the flaws of a perfect Nazi-type society and by the end the reader almost begins hating the humans and appreciating the bugs. The film was about gore."
3,Quite a smart movie for a blockbuster,"This movie just spells World War II. This clearly is a movie based on the idea that the American patriotism is a pretty scary thing, which resembles the Nationalism in Germany during the 1930s en 40s. I think it is an attack at the Hollywood moviemachine especially which makes youngsters believe that the greatest thing you can do is die for your country waving your flag."
1,Squalid travesty,"Heinlein was not exactly a second Socrates but he was a serious and often original writer. This is a squalid travesty and plainly a labour of hatred. Heinlein's ideas are mendaciously distorted. SF fans should avoid it, both for its defamation of the work of a major writer and for its bad science."
2,Good movie - by the book,"This is truly a great action movie, good sound, good picture... you know what you're in for from the start to the end. No surprises, nothing new, just action. Thus only 2 stars... But a really great movie!"
5,The extra features of the DVD make this a MUST-HAVE,"After reading the other reviews, I'm left with this opinion: A lot of people don't know how to review a DVD. You don't read this section to get a review of the MOVIE, you read this section to get a review of the DVD. If the movie rates 1 star, you don't give DVD 1 star because of that. Now for Starship Troopers. I saw this at the theater, and I liked it somewhat. It was action packed, and had nice one-liners and some humorous moments. If the DVD just had the movie, I would not have purchased it. But it has SOO much more! It has the FULL movie on the flip-side with the directors opinion of EVERY part of the movie. It also has scenes that didn't make the final production, which I felt made the entire Starship Trooper experience complete. This is the type of movie you can throw in when you're not doing anything and just watch. Get this DVD if you thought the movie was even SOMEWHAT interesting."
1,"Very Simply, a Very Bad Movie","There are so many things offensive and amateurish about this movie, I don't know where to start. The special effects ARE good and therein lies the problem. Typical of today's films, special effects are apparently the only ingredient needed for a ""entertaining"" movie. It's unfortunate that the movie going public has little regard for character development, plot, crisp dialogue and texture in a film. ""Starship Troopers"" has none of these.I'M thinking of becoming a director because the public is so easily entertained these days. Can you imagine Alfred Hitchcok, John Ford or William Wyler with todays technology? They would all realize that story and script all still the most important components of a film- NOT computers. ""Starship Troopers"" is a glaring example of the lack of talent in Hollywood. Come on public, be a little more choosey! And Hollywood, please. there are people OVER 12 years old that enjoy going to the movies."
2,"Great effects, minimal plot, little to do with the book",If you rate your movies in buckets of blood like Joe Bob Briggs you'll probably love it. Unfortuantely I'm not the Texas Chain Saw Masacre type of fan and other than appreciation for some spectacular effects I was extremely disappointed. I'm sure it made Heinlein roll over in his grave.
1,This is NOT Starship Troopers!,Poor Ginny! I'll bet she's kicking herself in the teeth right now for selling the movie rights to one of her late husband's best works ever. Even if all they wanted out of the script was the action they could have at least attempted to show the powered armor that attracted most of us to this book in the first place! As far as the 'anti-war' message of the film--bunk!!! The book was about social and moral responsibility not whether to be a war-monger or not.
1,Are people actually impressed by this?,"Amateurish acting, sophmoric moralizing (yeah, using the exaggerated stereotypes and gung ho kill 'em all attitudes is real revolutionary), and less than polished directing makes this an Oscar winner. Hogans Heroes had a more convincing antiwar/antifacist statement than this crap does."
1,Watching paint dry is more entertaining than this movie,"Easily one of the worst movies I've seen this decade. Admittedly, the alien animation was great, but the premise of the movie escapes me. Why send in ground troops when they were able to drop bombs from the sky with equal effect? For the action? I suppose so, but then why have the scene where they drop the bombs at all then? And with all of the other technology of the future, I'm supposed to believe their guns would only fire bullets? The ""acting"" in this movie was also horrible, and the lines and plot were entirely predictable. Don't bother."
3,A seriously flawed sci-fi thriller!,"Hey, I like the way the director TRIED, but I really can't call this film a success. For one thing, he picked a book that doesn't translate particularly well to the big screen, then changed it so as to make it almost unrecognizable. Still, I thought the action was fun, and the futuristic co-ed showers amusing."
2,Not What I Expected....,"The book was great, when I heard the movie was coming out, I was jumping for joy. But not when I got into the theater. Where were the space suits and weren't the characters supposed to be Hispanic? I mean common they were recruited in Buenos Aires for crying out loud. And all they seemed to use were infantry...where are the tanks and heavy artillery, it's also the future, shouldn't there have been lasers and particle beams. The reason this movie got 2 stars instead of 1 because of the excellent CGI and gore. Better to buy the book than the movie."
2,The book was classic... the movie was almost good.,I remember the day i saw Starship Troopers in the theater. I had read the book and was excited to see the movie. And it was well worth the wait exept for 4 minor details that bring the movie down. The first 2 details is its unfaithfulness to the movie. (1) where were the famous spacesuits from the book? They were a key part of the book and to exclude them was rediculous. (2) The characters were supposed to be hispanic (the earth scenes were in Venezuela). The next 2 faults center on its target audience. The book was intended to be a juvenial adventure but the movie only acted like it was for kids. Schlock-style gore and pointless nudity were definetly unneccesary. It could have been better.
4,Just Commentes,"This is one of my favorites movies, resolution is very good, and quality of product is excellent plus Zero handling Damage.In overview this was a great purchase."
4,Love the PSP,"I really enjoyed watching this on my PSP. My daughter had friends over and they were playing nintendo on the big TV so I watched this on my PSP, the clarity is unbelievably good, and I love this movie."
4,Excellent!,"This is a very interesting video. On the surface, a good, bloody, gory action flick, and underneath, a very strong social commentary on class distinctions. END"
3,Good movie...really Annoying actors,"Generally Starship Troopers is a great movie...The special effects are great the action is amazing and Verhoven's directorial style is very good...BUT the actors...where did they come up with these people? For me it was hard to watch the movie because of the fact I did'nt like the main character...keep Casper Van Dien in the jungle where he belongs... the two supporting women are completely annoying and I found myself liking the guy who was supposed to be the ""bad"" guy the best. Throw some good actors into starship troopers and it would have been a much better movie.. END"
5,One of the best sci-fi movies I've seen,"Got this movie looking for a B-type shoot-em-up, and for the first hour that's just what I thought it delivered. But it kept getting odder and odder and the end just blindsided me. Don't get drunk or let your attention waver -- this movie is subversive, and like all good subversive stuff, it'll get right past you if you aren't watching. If it weren't rated R I'd recommend it *strongly* to high school teachers looking for thematic material on propaganda or anti-war literature. As it is it would be appropriate in a community college or undergraduate setting. (Note that it is only very loosely based on the book)"
5,"Nose Bleed Fast, and Out of Control","If your into the Sci- Fi or Action genre you'll give this movie five stars for its fast paced, bloody, battle scenes, with its blazing effects, ""comic book"" style acting (reminicent of ""Evil Dead 2""), and its earth shattering surround sound. It can easily be described as the ""Motorhead"" of movies. If your not into the genre you still might find ""Starship Troopers"" funny with its hilariously satirical views on the media, and the military of the future. One things for sure, you'll either LOVE it or HATE it so why not give it a try? This movie is DEADLY!!!!"
4,One of the best Sci-fi movies around!!,"Every thing about this movie is cool, the visual and sound fx are outstanding, the plot is the only downside of the movie ,it's a little thin, hey you can't have everything can you? There are only two sci-fi movies that i would rate higher ,they are ,Star Wars and Aliens...If you love sci-fi movies then Starshiptroopers is a MUST"
1,Disappointing,"Probably the most anticipated and least enjoyable sci-fi movie of the 1990s- if not the entire post-WWII era. Starship Troopers was one of Heinlein's classic novels that combined great shoot-em-up action with his message about individualism and the role of the state. What the movie delivers is a badly written, amateurishly acted heavy handed attempt at social satire that just doesn't come off. Gone is the first-person perspective of the novel, replaced by a rather impersonal view that leaves you completely indifferent to the fate of the actors involved.More than one person has said the movie should have carried the tag line ""Adapted from the paperback cover of the novel!"" and that's about as close as it gets to the original novel. The battle scenes do manage to convey some of the horror of battle, but the bug effects look kind of cheap, the spcaecraft look cheesy and in the end you've got a pretty forgettable movie."
2,Terrible,"Paul Verhoeven once again shows his incompetence as a director in this gory, tedious and all too predictable sci-fi yawn. The cast looks like something from Beverly Hills 90210 and their acting ability is equally bad. The characters are one-dimensional and boring. The only reason that I give this movie 2 stars is because it does hold some useful warnings against propaganda and glorification of war, which was also present in the Heinleins book. But as a whole I will not recomend this movie to anyone."
5,Starship Troopers is great Sci-Fi Action! (4 1/2 Stars),"Look at the VEREHOVEN classics: TOTAL RECALL, ROBOCOP and BASIC INSTINCT- all entertaining thrillers!Now look at: STARSHIP TROOPERS and HOLLOW MAN... 2 films that the critics and audience alike put down!I think these movies are f/x filled awesome flicks! STARSHIP TROOPERS is great, but lacks realism- but it is just entertainment!STARSHIP TROOPERS is the story of the upcoming future, when four friends join the Infantry, Pilot Division and Science Studying programs to become a citizen. And they face some nasty, brain sucking bugs!MY REVIEW:""This is a fun movie! The action and effects are great! I just don't think that this is at all realistic! Of course, though, that's what movies are all about! This is a great one for adventure fans!""- MJV & the Movies."
4,A GREAT SCI-FI WAR FILM!,"I own this on vhs format for 1 year I seen it alot of time,now I got a DVD player & a Dolby Digital-DTS receiver,then I plan to buy this movie on DVD then I did buy it!so I put this on my player,I was surprise of the sharp picture quality and the full 5.1 surround sound.This is better then the clunky VHS I own,so the Starship Troopers was a great sci-fi war movie,killing all the bugs and lot of action and humour.I know this movie got lots of bad review back of 1997,but for me and everyone that like this movie go out and buy this on DVD."
1,Horrible,"I mean, these bugs are located about 1/4 around the galaxy andthe ""brain bugs"" just shoot them toward Earth and they gethere in about a month! Voyager travels at around 413 times the speed of light and it's going to take them about 70 years to reach the Alpha Quadrant if they just used warp drive. They should have named this movie ""Beverly Hills 90210 Goes to Space."". If you like cheesy plots, and shallow characters, this is THE movie for you. About the only thing missing was Jim Varney (Ernest P. Worell) as a Starship Commander. Yeah, the satire was obvious in the ""propaganda news"" clips, but I really don't think intentionally making a movie this bad makes it a ""great movie"". Save you money and save yourself; don't watch this movie."
4,Excellent B Movie,This is a review of the first movie of Starship Troopers.Excellent parity of war and governments. Ironically it came out before the Iraq war.Dina Meyer was nice enough to show her top in a coed shower. Just wish Denise Richards did not wait till later movies to show her top.
2,Not one of the best movies I've ever seen,"Great sound and video quality. Very poor acting, stupid story. I give it 2 stars for the dvd quality only."
3,"Stars off great, but only ends good!","TO BE HONEST, THIS WASN'T A BAD MOVIE AT ALL. SURE, IT'S STUPID: BUGS FROM SPACE ATTACKING EARTH. YET, THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO FUN! THE FACT THAT THE MILITARY PUTS ALL THIER STRENGTH INTO SOMETHING THIS STUPID! WELL, IT'S NOT BAD, AND IS OFTEN QUITE ENTERTAINING. UNFORTUNATLY, NOT EVERYONE WILL THINK SO, AND NOT EVERYONE WILL GET A KICK OUT OF THIS."
1,Classic Book - Bad Movie,If you hoping for a film that lives up to the quality of the Heinlein novel you'll be greatly disappointed as I was. The entire subtext of the utopian military society of the future is forgone in favor of a high-gloss sci-fi shoot-em-up. If you're looking for a slick sci-fi action film you might like this one and rate it a 3 Stars. I was hoping for a little more.
2,Soo.... stupid...,"I've seen this movie about three times now, and I admit that it was interesting the first time. The second time you noticed all the logical faults, and the third time you just puked.1. What the HELL did the fleet do ? ""The fleet is engaged in a large operation!"" Yeah, sure. Stand still and get blown up. No planetary bombardment, no nothing.2. Hand2hand ? pleeeeasee... ""Captain, why don't we send in some aircrafts and blow them bugs dead ?"" ... ""Nah... send some marines with useless weapons and get them killed... more fun that way""3 - 30. Other stupid things about this movie"
1,Worst Sci-Fi movie ever made,"This movie offers nothing to the true Sci-Fi fan. Special effects are nice yes, but we've have plenty of computer generated monsters running around recently. It is the worst Sci-Fi film ever made because the great special effects technology, huge budget, and excellent story (I'm referring to Heinlein's orginal, not the screen play) fell so far short of what it should have been.In 10 years it will make excellent MST 3K fodder."
1,Melrose Space,"Is there a half-star rating available?Bugs that can obtain knowledge from sucking out human brains (can you say 1950's SciFi?)Boot camp accidents punished by whipwhat century was this taking place?Huge starships capable of navigating the universebut we didn't see that big rock coming at us. Well, not until it was right on us anywayNothing resembling a tank; no advanced bombing; no air supportmaybe once, if you ask nicely.Nuff said END"
1,Bugs actually out-act worthless cast in cinematic howler.,"""Starship Troopers"" is a movie that features some of the most beautiful young actors and actresses in its cast, only to have them all upstaged by computer-generated bugs in a film so badly directed, simplistically written, and worthlessly acted the movie would truly be a B-Movie dive not even profitable enough for video release if not for director Paul Verhoven's megabucks spent on special effects. To compare this farce to ""Star Wars."" as some reviewers have, is nothing more than cinematic blasphemy. This thing isn't even worth sharing the stage with ""Krull"" or ""Yor."" Set in the future where the human race must take on a species of bugs that threaten to destroy the earth, the film ornaments itself with beautiful people and great effects to cover-up its subliminal and disgusting glorification of Nazism, not to mention its mindless plot. In all, the film is a sad reminder that the era of great science fiction films has perhaps passed us by. END"
2,"Good effects,dumb movie.","This film has outstanding effects but what a dumb movie it is(so typical of Verhoven's bad direction).The ships can wipe out thousands of bugs with naplam in seconds so why are the troops firing bullets?Why are the orbiting spaceships bunched together like sitting ducks when they could be thousands of miles apart?Why don't the ground troops have air support?Why aren't the fort's surrounding areas mined?Like I said,a big dumb movie."
4,Non stop action and fun. It's a great no-brainer!,"There really isn't much to the story line, but the amazing special effects make up for what it is lacking. This is just a fun movie to sit back and enjoy all that they have to throw at you. Its good to occasionally see a movie that doesn't make you think too hard. Make sure you turn your brain off before viewing, because you definitely won't need it for this one! END"
3,"Good effects, bad character plot.","I felt the overall plot of this movie was very creative, but the characters in this movie were a bit lost. Trying to have romance when this movie is clearly not designed for it is a mistake. It's action sequences are really intense though. END"
3,Depends on how you look at it...,"Well, if you're looking for an actionpacked gung-ho special effects extraveganza, this is a movie for you. The effects are great and when it comes to action this kicks arse! I just hope you don't care for crummy acting, (I'm sorry but Casper is just silly I think)BUT......If you like the book, do NOT watch this movie! It is a horrible disgrace to it. The only thing kept basicly was the title, the character names and the bugs. Everything else is made up the director's head. Although I don't really care, the gore is very nasty, the dialogue is poor and it incorporates pointless nudity which wasn't needed at all.BUT......If you're like me and is just a StarCraft fan, you'll think this is cool because it's a lot like the Terran against the Zerg."
5,This film has everything,"Knowing Paul Verhoeven's films are a little pervy but this is just plain brilliance. Sex, gore and whole lot more is what you get from this film. Now that doesn't sound like much but given Verhoeven's trademark cynical humour....it all adds up to be one great movie"
1,What a waste of natural resources!,"I cannot believe how botched up this movie was. It's based on one of the classic novels of science fiction. The only resemblence between Heinlein's work and this movie is the title! Okay, okay, the bugs were there. But, what about the mechanized armor?!? Okay, okay, we have to show their smiling faces. But, we will show a society that has the capability of inter-galatic space travel, but only arm our troopers with mere slug-throwers.Please, please for the love of God, pass this one by."
3,Stupid but what a great shower scene,"I watch this movie all the time. It is so stupid, but it is a hoot to watch. Girl goes right from high school to a short immersion tour at space academy and immediately becomes not only a commissioned officer but a pilot too. Meanwhile, her highschool boyfriend becomes a field grunt enlisted man. The gore was really well done. Denise Richards is hot but never nude. The shower scene is a turn-on but not necessarily due to the brief nudity but at the idea that the male and female recruits are so matter-of-fact about showering together. I am embarrassed at giving this really bad, bad film 3 stars, but it is a fun dumb escape on occasion."
1,Rotten movie from terrific book,"While this movie is supposedly based on the Heinlein book of the same name the only resemblance it bears is the names. The entire basis for ""Mobile Infantry"" in the book is the space armor that the troopers wear and the movie eliminates that armor.One doesn't expect the armor to be explained in detail as in the book but one does expect it to be worn since it WAS the basis for the book.The movie does not even deserve the one star that I was forced to give it."
1,Starship Troopers disc will not load,"My gripe is not with the movies, but with the disc. The first disc ""Starship Troopers"" would not load in my Sony bluray player after 10 minutes. ST2 and ST3 loaded within a minute. My bluray player has the latest firmware updates, and I have never experienced a disc not loading."
3,A subtle satire of the novel,"This film may in the end prove to be almost as controversial as the novel on which it was based. Robert Heinlein's novel, written in 1959, has been reviled as fascist propaganda, with its glorification of militarism. While Heinlein denied this, the world he depicts - a military elite holds political power, and wages war against enemies viewed as sub-human - bears an uncanny resemblance to Nazi Germany. The film sides with the novel's critics. Earth is portrayed as authoritarian, although not entirely totalitarian, while military leaders are portrayed as thugs. In contrast to the novel, war is depicted as brutal. The brave young soldiers who are inspired by civic duty do not achieve glory, but rather die in droves and end up as decomposing corpses. All in all, the film is a subtle satire of the novel."
4,Humans vs. Bugs,"4 stars of 5 for this classical sci-fi movie. Yeah, I've seen Starship Troopers lots of times. It is a unique story with great characters and well produced. This is a really fun sci-fi movie to watch. Great special effects and a nice future look. As always, my only complaint is why send ground troops with under-powered weapons to attack the ""bugs"" without air support? Oh, well. I do recommend this movie."
5,"The movie, not the book....","This review is for this great action packed movie. Not for the idiots that try to judge it against the book. The graphics are great as well as the action. It has a super story that makes the movie a big hit. If you want to read a review on the book, then go to the book and read the seperate reviews for it. This is a review for the movie on dvd since that is where you are at, here at amazon."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"Morally complex film? For complex, and moral, read the book. The film is a piece of trash masquerading as a movie based on a great classic sci fi novel, with flat characters who don't even have enough depth to make you hate them, much less like them. Rating this 1 star because there's no way to rate it lower, don't waste your time with this one, especially if you've read the book it was supposedly based on."
3,"Good Movie, Wrong Name","The movie is fun. It is filled with action and adventure and great special effects. The story is interesting, all in all one of the best sci fi films in recent years, but...It needs a different title. Heinlein's novel points out the failings of the American justice and social systems and offers alternatives. I have read the book many times and his suggestions are not satire. Heinlein was often critical of modern society in his works (Farnham's Freehold, etc).Not to mention the different identities of the characters in the books. Women are not allowed in combat, Flores is a man who gets killed in the first chapter, Carl dies early on and is not in ""Games and Theory,"" etc. Heinlein's story is a first person narrative of John (Juan) Rico's life in the MI as well as a book honoring the US Marines.Do see the movie, it is a good time, but read the book as well! The book will make you think, the movie will make you smile."
3,Great action - comic book story,"First rate action scenes, but comic book story and characters. The futuristic movie follows a group of former students who enlist in the armed forces and find themselves fighting giant insects. One young man goes from raw recruit to colonel in only a year (""Here's to bloody war and quick promotion"", you might say) Fast forward the first hour, but watch for the uni-sex shower. The battle scenes are intense and exciting (and gruesome). The characters suffer from testosterone overload, even the women, as fights break out frequently and everybody tries to out-macho the next guy (or gal).If you want exciting action, this movie has it, but if you want drama as well, it's not there."
1,Save your money and yourselves!,"C'mon guys! This opinion of ""intellectually silly"" is really....silly. The idea that if you intentionally make a move so ludicrous that somehow it MUST have an intellectual undertone is insulting to those of us who really do know ""Intellectual comedy""(i.e. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead). The idea that a solar system located about 10,000 light years away can shoot ""bug bombs"" acroos the galaxy in a couple of months time is ascenine. Couple that with ""Melrose Place in Space"" mentality and you have this...ahem...picture. The only thing missing was Jim Varney (aka Ernest Worl) as ""Der Fuherer""...to make so satrical as to make it intellectually intriguing...yeah, right..."
1,Very unrealistic,"To be perfectly honest, the special effects and sound for the movie was amazing. If it wasnt for that I would have probably tossed the DVD out. I find it kinda a silly movie which ABSOLUTELY 0% portrays the real way the human race would deal with a problem such as that. First of all, we would NEVER attempt to send in troops armed with pretty much water guns against a gigantic insect with jaws that are able to rip apart a tank. Secondly, we would NEVER get rid of air support or tank support and move to just troops. Unless we are fighting chickens with sticks who the heck would send in troops against a big bug? We would carpet bomb, blast the area and pick up scraps later. A bug with a brain would not be the first thing we would care about, we would care about winning and being on top! They could have done a better job with it."
5,Great adaptation of Heinlein's fascist vision,This film presents a very intelligent and original look at a plausible future society that seems somewhere between libertarian and fascist. Accusations that Verhoeven is attempting to make a fascist movie are absurd and insulting to a man who lived through the Nazi occupation of Holland.Listen to his director's commentary.
1,Could have been an ok movie,"The disappointing thing about this movie is the apparent hostility that the director and screenwriter had for the concepts in the original novel. For them to make a sci-fi action movie giving us their view of the future is one thing. To (apparently) deliberately take another artist's work and distort his vision is entirely another.I often find myself in disagreement with Mr. Heinlein on many issues, but to take his work, deliberately change the message of that work and then use his title in an apparent attempt to capitalize on his reputation is reprehensible and, for me at least, prevents me from enjoying the rather good technical aspects of the film."
3,We Want You To Join The Fight Agianst Bugs,"This movie is like army propaganda, and the story dosen't really anwser alot of your questions about the movie, but if you like things ripping people to shreddes, then your like this."
1,I thought this was based on the book.....,"Look at the white Johnny Rico....When I heard that ST was being made into a movie I barely contained my excitement. Just think, powered armor, great effects, incredible sound, fascinating story. After ten minutes I thought I was in the wrong theatre. I had a hard time not killing the teenagers behind me who seemed awed by the ""really deep story."" Apparently they have never read the book...or any book for that matter. I don't think this movie could have been worse. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. I guess Hollywood thinks all of us are mindless morons who like flashy lights, things that go boom, and actors (hahaha) we should feel sad for because their hair got out of place. I guess being ""snooty"" is expecting Hollywood to make an intelligent film based on an intelligent book. Independence Day was the movie to not think and just have fun. ST was the movie to show the world that most of the best SF was written in the 40's - 60's."
2,If only I hadn't read the book.,"I had been wishing for a long time that someone would film a version of ""Starship Troopers"" that would do justice to the original book. I'm still waiting.The effects were good - especially the bugs - but the movie didn't make the CGI artists' efforts worthwhile. They left out almost all of the things that made the book great - the emphasis on personal responsibility, the bloody failures in the early part of the war, and the whole motivation for the war. I don't remember them mentioning the whole ""we make them extinct or they make us extinct"" angle anywhere.The amplified armor? Couldn't do that - you might hide the faces of the actors. What you ended up with is a goofy story of a bunch of teenagers shooting bugs, and a lot of extras getting sliced up.This movie sucketh, and sucketh mightily."
3,Shallow Interpretation of Book,"This movie was, at best, a loose interpretation of Heinlein's classic novel. Sure, there were bugs (lots of bugs) but the characters were developed in a rather shallow manner, and the relationships were not investigated deeply. In fact, if the scriptwriters even read the book, I'd be surprised."
1,Save Your Self!,"This movie was terrible. Terrible acting. terrible writing, terrible design. Sure, they have computer generated special effects, but hwo doesn't? They aren't even done well.Even the comedy of seeing Doogie Houser, M.D. looking like a 1940's German secret agent isn't funny enough to save this movie.Read the book - don't suffer through the movie."
4,The Terran/Zerg war.,"No, your right, the movie has nothing to do with Star Craft, Yet watching it made me feel like I was terran foot soldier! Ok, I can do better than this... The movie was great! I watched it and wonderred why it was so poorly talked about? Sur, some of the effects are ppor like the giant fire worm blow up seen. But it's humor and mix of blood bath battle scenes make this title a definate buy. Few films I see make me want t o\watch them again, but this one is definatly one of the few I do want to see again."
3,A Good Movie But It Could Be BETTER!!,"Let's just think a moment shall we? These people can pilot starships yet they don't have lasers they don't enen have any tanks or anything I mean if you are going to blow a planet you need a tank. Also the acting could be a lot better, where did they dig these people up I've never heard of them in my life if you are going to have a great movie you could at least have someone that can act!"
1,Best movie ever? Have you all gone bonkers!,"This sci-fi (I use that term because this truly is garbage.) B movie is fun to laugh at, but it is a horrible movie in its own right. Bad actors, nordic looking Argentinians, goofy plot, annoying characters, sophomoric humor, moronic..... well it just goes on like that. I could see saying it is a fun brainless movie, but not that it is great."
3,"IS NOT VERHOEVEN""S BEST!!!!","This is not Verhoeven's best.Look at Robocop,Total Recall,Basic Instinct.Was Starship Troopers better than all of those? I normally like Verhoeven because I like violence and am probably as morbid about it as he is.But Starship didn't have ENOUGH of it.It basically was a violent movie so give us a large dose of it!!!! what are you afarid of? I didn't like Edward Neumier's script or Heinlein's novel either.It was unnecessarily long and had pointless chit chat that bored me.I didn't particularly like Basil Poledouris's music like I normally do.But it was a one-time see movie."
2,Ok.,"This is an in-your-face, hackey-slashey, gory, action adventure movie. Or at least it tried to be. ""Starship Troopers"" was needlessly gory, not that I didn't like it, but it just got graphic to the point where it was stupid. But I like bloody movies, so it's all good. Should've gotten an Oscar for best make-up."
2,Expensive but not very creative or original,This movie annoyed me quite a bit and pretty much insulted my inteligence in many scenes. I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I'd been drunk or had a labotamy first. On the other hand if you want nothing but action in a movie then you will probably like it.
3,"Very good DVD technically, but a brainless movie","A fantastic DVD in sound and picture. A very good way of showing off the format in a media room.Unfortunately, the movie is a mindless media matter. It has only the most superficial resemblance to the Heinlein book, which is far more a cerebral treatment of politics and the responsibilities of citizenry. The DVD special section in fact shows a cut scene which had more discussion about the Heinlein philosophy of citizenry.This movie owes more to the popular action/science fiction book ""Armor"" (John Steakley -- look it up in Amazon, it's a good read) than the classic ""Starship Troopers""."
2,8 out of 12 is a bad average,"I read the other reviews about receiving the 1.5"" X 4"" bubble pack of picks in a 9"" X 12"" X 4"" carton. I thought I could avoid any loss by combining the shipment with two other items that were in the same catagory-a guitar tuner and a chord book. But it didn't work. They sent the picks as a single item. ALL the picks were out of their package and I received 8 out of the 12 I ordered. Avoid the frustration, Don't order them here. I read four reviews that warned me about this but I thought I was smarter. I was wrong.The picks are gorgeous and they are the Fender Mediums you've grown to know and love. But get your moneys worth-go somewhere else to get them."
1,Packaging Awful,"I read the reviews, but figured, I was ordering with a few other things that would be shipped together, so the little plastic clamshell of picks would be well packed with a few other small items (capo, strings) and wouldn't be stuck in a huge box. The picks were packed appropriately in a small box with my other items, but like so many other reviews it opened and the picks all came out. I was able to get 5 of them out of the box, the other seven disappeared. Don't order these picks, you'll only get frustrated. Wish I'd heeded the warnings I read here."
1,"Ordered 12, only got 3!!! Where are the rest???","I order 2, 12 packs of picks for stocking stuffers. I received 1 unopened package of 12 and 3 in an opened package. Huge box and I looked down the sidewalk for the rest of them.....didn't find them!"
1,Pick a better pick,"The picks are fine. It is clear from the reviews that packing/shipping problems are the headache. I received half of the picks. The little packaging for the picks themselves had clearly been sliced open with a blade and a few of the picks were scattered in the shipping box, the rest had slipped out through the flaps."
1,Seven out of twelve is awful...,"The one star here is not for the product itself. Fender picks are excelllent. But I only received seven out of the twelve I ordered. The remaining four were presumably ""lost in transit"", as the small plastic box Fender originally packages these picks opened inside the large Amazon box in which the picks were shipped. The picks fell out and scattered in the big box. Some must have fallen out of the big box during transport, because I could only find five when the big box got to me.Definitely not a good deal. Next time, I'll just walk over to the nearest guitar shop. Why does Amazon find it necessary to ship a small, easily-opened plastic box inside a huge cardboard box? This is objectionable on the practical grounds that items will not arrive as shipped and also on grounds of waste of materials. Heard of our environment? It's not in a state that would make such waste tolerable. This item would be better shipped in a small envelope."
3,Meh.. The good and the bad.,"Well as i read the other reviews.. I heard it was pretty much going to be ""Bad packaging"" and ""Missing picks"". I myself decided to go with pure luck and but it anyways. First of all.. Delivery. It was delivered 5 days before it was supposed to. 5 starts for that. Packaging.. The box was way to big! and when you would tilt the box a little you could hear all the picks inside sliding around inside the box.. Which is pretty much horrible. Now i can't complain much, because unlike the other people although the packaging was horrible i got all 12 picks =] So in the end 3/5.~Animefan1310"
1,Poor packaging design!,"Poor packaging design! Missing over half the picks. Do not recommend unless you want 6 picks, not 12."
4,Not the best,"The picks are great but the package came ripped in half. If the picks actually came in the plastic case as the pictures show i didnt get it, they came in a little zip-lock bag."
1,What the hell?!,"This is rediculous. I ordered these cool looking, multi-colored guitar picks. So, I was expecting them. Not only did I get the picks late, but the picks were just a flat black color. Don't advertise what you aren't going to send out. I would just recommend that you go to your local guitar shop and buy some, especially since they are practically the same price."
5,Great fender picks!,"Reading the previous reviews, I was kinda scared that I wouldn't get all of them. Fortunately, when they came in the mail, they were all there. But seeing the way that they were packaged, they could have easily fallen out. So you're gonna gamble if you buy these because some may get lost in the mail as result of poor packaging. I was fortunate to get all of them. As for the picks themselves, they are really good picks. They make my Yamaha guitar give off a nice sound."
3,Excellent picks,"I definitely like the tone I get from these a lot more than the tone I get from the cheapo promo ones I get at the rehearsal studio. The confetti pattern also makes sure you'll be able to see them on the floor if you drop them while playing.Can't really say much more other than, you'll be happy with them."
2,partially lost in shipping,supposed to be a 12 pack...but the pick pack opened inside the shipping box and 8 of the 12 picks slipped out through cracks in bottom of shipping box...i was not pleased to only receive 4 picks
2,Only got 10...,Well I ordered these when I ordered my stand just to get sum more.The picks were scattered all over the box.I dont know if it was Amazon or the shipping people.But I probally wont order anything like this again from here I'll just go to the store.
1,NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER!,I DID NOT receive my item by Christmas. The day AFTER Christmas I received an enevelope that contained an invoice for the guitar picks I orderd. .99 for the picks and 7.48 SHIPPING. That is absurb! almost 800% of the cost of the item and I DID NOT receive the item. Ridiculous!
2,Eight out of Twelve,"For a few bucks, I decided to see if the packaging problem had been solved. My order in April '09 came loose in a huge box, the package had opened inside and the picks were scattered around, some under the flaps caught on the tape and some gone through the cracks. I felt lucky that I got eight out of twelve, but I won't be ordering more. This could be fixed so easily by sending them in a padded envelope, or at least adding a piece of tape."
2,7 out of 12,"Well, I decided to take a chance, even though other customers had had problems. I got 7 picks out of 12."
1,How to rate an item that was never received?,"I know that these picks are definitely good, however I can not rate the picks that were never received. People from Amazon sent me an empty (open) package which makes me suppose that the contents must be somewhere in their depot. Unfortunately, I never received an explanation on this matter (despite my claims), for which reason I do not recommend AT ALL buying this item from Amazon (this statement is not original, since this experience had already been reported by others, but I did not paid enough attention at the time of the purchase)."
3,Should be called a 10 pack.,"If they would have put a piece of tape on the little plastic container that these picks came in, I would have received all 12. After looking under the flaps in the box and in the jacket of the book that they were shipped with I found 10. Good product, good price, terrible packaging."
1,They fall out durring shipping.,I through these in to get free freight. When they arrived all but three picks where gone. They aren't sealed and get lost in trasit.
1,Horrible Packaging,"Great picks! Unfortunately, the picks come in a box large enough for a computer monitor. There were only 8 in the box and it is easy to see where they will fall out with this type of packaging. What an annoyance. A little bit of tape and they would never have come out of their original packaging."
3,Packaging needs improvement,"The picks were nice and of good quality. However, when they arrived, there were only 5 picks out of 12. The rest were missing due to damaged packaging (ripped little ziplock bags). I called up the seller to inform them. They expedited another 12 picks to me - no questions asked - so that was really nice. The new picks arrived a couple of days later intact. The seller must be aware of the poor packaging issue, and wonder why they don't just fix it. I can't imagine that it would cost that much more to secure some picks."
1,amazon shipping picks fall out of box,"I bought these picks from Amazon, they arrived in a 8x 10 inch box for one tiny box of picks. The inner box of picks had broken open and only 3 picks remained. I reported this. They sent me another set of picks in the same giant box and the same thing happened, I received 8 picks this time. I gave up, I'll buy picks from my local store. Amazon is not a company to invest in if they can't ship a box of picks without screwing it up , twice........."
1,Package Broken Open,Package was broken open and picks were all over the shipping carton. Half the picks were missing. I was offered a refund if I returned the product but declined since it was only a $3 item and wasn't worth the effort.
2,"Product is great, packaging was a problem",The packaging opened up in shipping and instead of the 12 picks I ordered there was only 4 or 5 in the box.
2,White picks are not as shown.,"Bought the white ones. Their not plain white, but rather that velvety pattern white. Still decent picks- just not what it looked like I was buying, and I much more prefer the plain white ones that I thought I was getting. Return shipping cost isn't worth it, though."
2,"if available, buy the heavy version......;P",The medium picks brake quite easy. I've only had them for a couple weeks and they're starting to brake off at the tips.
3,They weren't kidding...,I thought i'd take my chances and see if i won the lottery with this purchase and i feel i did compared to a lot of the other reviews. I picked up the box off of my porch and two picks fell out onto my sidewalk. all together i ended up with 11 picks which i was pretty happy to get.
2,"Product good, Shipping bad","I ordered this product for my son. The problem is the pack containing the picks was opened within the shipping box and due to the fact that the box was just taped in certain spots, all of the picks except two had fallen out of the box. There was no way to return it because there was no way to prove that I only received 2 of the picks. Would have been a great price, for a great pick, IF I had received all 12."
4,6 Missing picks!!!,I bought a pickpack of 12 picks and I recieved only six picks. The package label says that there were 12 picks.... but the picks are great.
3,A Matter of Choice,"InDesign-a lovely second act to the ubiquituous Quark. I have been using Indesign for about three months and while I appreciate many of the differences, I find it a perplexing and often frustrating program. It seems to have a mind of its own. Type suddenly becomes highlighted, drop shadows appear unwanted, and if anyone can figure out the how to line type up on the baseline (the fools at Adobe support certainly don't) please let us in on it. It's a program with too many choices, too many foolish options. Design, while always in the market for options can suffer from too many, delicate controls. I am happy to have learned InDesign, but I must confess it is with some relief and confidence that I often return to that embattled Quark just to get the job done."
5,Magellan Universal Cradle,Magellan 702176 Roadmate Universal Cradle work like the original equipment. I am very satisfied with it.
3,Thought this would fix my problem,"Considering the power pin in the mount appeared to be loose, I thought this would fix my issue. The power cord appeared fine. Sorry to say, this did not fix the problem and only when I bought the power cord (a gamble) did both work. It's almost like the mount and the cord were made for each other and neither would work by itself."
1,sucks,"Item was received bad, not able to use, and you refused to accept it back.The response from Amazon was to resell it!!!!!!!!I also contacted the shipper and they also refused accepting the cradle back.I have contacted Magelan and so far nothing.Either credit my account or send me a working part!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I think I've screwed over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Dale Novak"
3,Not a good design overall - external antenna not hook up to the cradle,The design of the cradle is needed to improve. The external antenna is not hooked up to the cradle but instead you need to connect the external antenna to the GPS unit. It is a bad design for those users who want to remove the GPS unit from the cradle whenever they park their cars.
5,Cradle for Magellan roadmate,"Not only did the product arrives promptly, it was new, and work as such.Great price, great product.I will definitely continue my purchase here in these conditions.txsAnthony"
2,OK in a pinch but there has to be better,"Purchased this product in 2005. It was my first experience both with kayaks and kayak carriers. At first was pretty pleased. With time I found this product less than satisfactory. The tightening mechanism on these is pretty hokey. In today's manufacturing environment I expect good design especially on a fairly expensive product. The tighteners feel like off the shelf equipment. They take a fair amount of time to put on and off. As there is no locking mechanism this happens twice on every outing. Second, over time they these racks are feeling pretty wobbly. Third, the tightening mechanism destroyed the factory racks on my Forester. I also own a Thule hitch bike rack. I am disappointed there as well. Thule uses lots of metal and heavy parts but truly seems to be lacking in design."
4,This is a great product with 1 drawback,I am very pleased with this rack. the only thing I do not like is that to install the rack you have to hand tighten it to your roof rack. I would have thought they would have a quick release latch or something. I guess I'm just lazy. I reccoment this product!
4,Thule,"This is the second carrier we have purchased, we put two Kayaks on the roof.Like the ease to attach to car roof rack, and ease to load kayaks.Strapping is somewhat cumbersome if you have a bigger vehicle (SUV), but still a convienent way to go!"
3,Ju got 2 B kidding,"Best of ? ,,, A John Lennon song in a Best of Roxy Music ...Pretty bad , and the selection pretty lame ... No Go ... Roxy Music , not Brian Ferry , who does cover anybody pretty much ..."
3,How many more collections do we have to suffer?,"Lets make it short: in the market there are about 5-6 collections of Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry with Roxy Music. So... any reason for one more? Sorry - the answer is negative. It's been told for more than once, that the band made a huge change in its musical direction, so fans who like Roxy of the 70's are not in the list of Roxy of the 80's. So... if you want to buy a collection of the band, ask yourself first, if you like ""Flesh and blood"" and ""Avalon"", or prefer the earlier ""Stranded"" and ""For your pleasure"". Then - check up the years of the recordings (are they relevant to your taste?) and make up your decision. To me, such a mix can not get more than 3 stars."
3,For new fans,"Clearly released to support their current tour, this album provides a new fan with an excellent opportunity to acquaint themselves with Roxy Music. That being said, there is no reason whatsoever for any other fan to purchase this, unless you are really bent on having some sort of complete collection. These songs are all on other albums. Even the single Pyjamarama is found on the Street Life compilation released a few years after the groups '83 breakup. This compilation is well put together though, making it arguably the best get-acquainted compilation of Roxy work to date. There are some mysteries though, like why Same Old Scene was included instead of say, Editions of You or a third song off the glistening Avalon album. Recommended only for new fans."
4,Good collection!,"I had heard 'Avalon' and 'Over You' many, many years ago on the radio and ironically enough it was Voice of America with Pat Gates hosting the show. (Wonder where she is now) It was since then that I had been on the look out for a compilation of numbers by Roxy Music, not a very well known group in my part of the world.This particular collection of hits is one not to be missed. If you like Roxy Music, go for this CD.BR"
3,"Arrived as expected but did not match with my truck, must return","The KYB shocks KG5538 have arrived very fast in excellent condition. But when I brought them to Midas in Anchorage to change my old shocks, the technician told me they were 2 inches short from what I need, so I have to install the standard shocks which Midas supplied me from their stock. Now I need to return them back. I have checked before buying the shocks that they should be OK for my Toyota Tacoma 1996 truck, but unfortunately they did not work with the standard leaf springs which I also bought from Amazon.com to replace my old leaf springs which were also broken."
1,Pass on this one,This movie has been butchered by the Korean censors. I do not understand why a Korean company would bother to issue such a DVD if they are timid about showing the human anatomy. The continuous cuts are done with no regard to the the continuity so that scenes jump from one place to another constantly throughout the movie as the censors delete the offending frames. I am amazed that the copyright holders of this movie would allow this version to come out under the movie's title. It is so completely eviscerated that it bears no relation to the intent of the original film.
2,not what I expected from tinto brass,It was a alright film I guess and i dont want to be a perv but this wasnt the usual tits and ass film you might expect from tinto brass. I would put this in the b-move field without the nudity. throughout the film.
3,Dora...??,"My daughter recently got this for Xmas and was not even sure who it was supposed to be. She LOVES Dora so it seemed really odd to me. She has now figured it out, but it isn't really as big of a hit as I had hoped for."
2,She's a rag doll!,"The hair on this doll is sewn in strips, not close together, she is sort of like rag doll. She is soft and lovable though."
2,too big too cheap,"Look great in the picture, they were a gift, and honestly the stripes are fuzzy and ugly up close...I am 5'4"" and to get the thigh highs unwrinkled I have to pull them up ENTIRELY to the top of my leg! ridiculous!"
2,Cheap,Very Cheap. Very Disappointed. If you want to go for the cheap trashy look these will work great. If not don't waste your money.
2,I knew what to expect but...,"I loved the movies and they were exactly what I expected. The only problem I have, and it's a big problem, is that the audio in Don't Answer the Phone was awful!!! It was so muffled that it surpassed just being annoying and really hindered the experience. I did like the movies, and I have to agree with the guy above that said these movies should have been on seperate DVD's. I have other ""Welcome to Grindhouse"" DVD's and I can honestly say this is the first problem I have encontered in terms of quality."
5,cd,great songs great fun with with family the service was fast will order again from seller my grandchildren can learn some of the old gospel saongs
2,WEAK and generic,I was looking for some solid ideas to take my game to the next level. I am kind of in a rut and trying to get back up to USTA 4.5 I thought this book might have some good tips but it is watered down info more suited to beginning players. I was disappointed. I didn't get much out of it.
5,Low Fat Yet Fine Dining!,"This cookbook has excellent recipes for the gourmet and for the cook who just has people to feed, plain and simple. It is very ""user friendly"" and clear and gives those who want or need to keep their fat and caloric intake at a certain level a delicious and easy way to do so. Helps immensely in maintaining a fit weigh of life!"
4,Thrills and Shrills is what you get when you read this book!,"You are trapped in Dr.EEEK's labs and need to get out before something happens to you...you choose the scare, just like it says!!! And this book has tons of em'!!!!"
4,great aouthor,"this book is very intresting and I like it because you can choose your story, your adventure, and your ways. this book tells you a lot of things about thoughts, thats another reason why I like this book and his aouthor style"
3,I like the Natural Gingham Pattern Bouncette By Combi - MUCH BETTER!!,"I registered for and rec'd this item for my baby shower. I never saw it in person and went by reviews. When I opened it up it look flimsy and cheap. I tried my newborn in it for a few times, but kept feeling like he was going to fall out at any moment! So, my mom found me the Combi (Natural Pattern)Bouncette - because I have ALL of the B is for Bear pattern. The Combi bouncette matches perfectly and even has a bear! Its available on Babysus website and in stores ... and is so much more sturdy. Also, as a bonus, I found out that Combi makes a play yard that matches the B is for Bear (by Eddie Bauer) pattern, too. (Its also called the ""Natural Gingham"" pattern by Combi.) So, I was very pleased!! (The play yard is available through amazon or I bought it at babystyle.com)"
2,totally useless and boring,"This is why you should wait to buy some things until you get to know your baby ! I regsitered for this bouncer b/c i thought i would like the way the neutral colors matched my decor... this is NOT what you need to base your decisions on !! This bouncer is flat with no head support, i had to buy a car seat head support to put in it. The toys are boring and not colorful so they barely get Katie's attention. She will not sit in this for long at all. Thank goodness Katie's grandma bought her the cute pink Sweet Daisy bouncer from Carter's b/c she likes that one. One good thing i am looking forward to trying next summer is the zippered bug screen, if she will stay in this bouncer long enough that will be a great thing for outdoors."
2,My girl cries everytime,My husband and I recieved this bouncer from our good friends. They bought it because of the zipper neating and the bed feature. My daughter who is now 6wks hates this bouncer. Everytime I put her in it she cries. If your baby is long he/she will not fit in this bouncer. The bed in this thing is hard as a rock. Also I noticed that the bouncer somewhat leans to the back so my babies feet are higher than her head. Sorry to say but I'm very disappointed in something with Eddie Bauer in the name. :(
3,An OK Baby Seat,"My daughter mainly used this to sleep in when we first brought her home. She didn't like her crib, I think because she didn't feel snug. One of the reasons I picked this seat is because of it's reclining function and it worked perfectly for that. However, in a seated position my baby slides down, and she hates when I strap her in.Great option as a bassinette, but I'd find something else if you're looking for a ""bouncer""."
3,"Cute to look at, but small","We bought this bouncer for our 4 month old daughter because her Papasan turned out to be too small, and this one didn't fare much better. My daughter's a big girl (16.5 lbs. and 27.5"") and this chair's already too short for her. It's a really nice looking chair, super easy to assemble and the fact that you can zip it to keep out potential pests are cool, but the short dimensions are a real problem. She has never shown any interest in the attached toys or the nature sounds, and the vibration is so mild I don't think she even notices it. Still, it's so nice looking if it was more generous in length it would probably have been a keeper."
2,WASTE OF MY MONEY,"Like a lot of other reviews, my complaints focus on the following:...bulkiness of the bouncer...difficulty moving it from room to room because of the ""legs"" that flip around...the hard bottom that does not cradle baby, so she slides from side to side...the very difficult clasps that leave you with brused fingertips...the small size of it that my 4 month old outgrew at 2 months...the horrible 'nature' sounds that start out VERY loud and static-y and scare my daughter and/or wake her up when turned on...the toys that hit her in the head whenever I put her in or take her out of the contraption.BIG disappointment!"
1,Not that impressed,"The only good thing about this is that is is a nice snuggly bed. It never bounced, the vibrator works once in a while, the boring tous hit my son on the head unless the net is zipped up, and it is impossible to travel with, and heavy. The straps always stick too. Dont waste your money"
1,It's a piece of junk,"My baby was 10 lbs and too big for the seat. He did not look comfortable in it and the cushion was very hard, not soft at all. The straps did not reach around him, not that he was going anywhere because he could barely fit in the seat. The straps should be longer to fit ALL babies. I did NOT like anything about this product."
3,not sure how safe this thing is,ok I put this on my registary and was estactic that I got two of them.. When I was setting it up it was very difficult for me to do especially at 8mos pregnant. my other concern is that it leans too forward and I was afraid that my poor son would be catapulted forward. it didnt even make it home with me to NY it stayed at my parents house whch they are going to return it...
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"WE BOUGHT THIS BOUNCER BECAUSE I HAVE TWO CATS AND WAS AFRAID IF I WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM THEY WOULD BOTHER OUR DAUGHTER. WELL, BEING THAT THIER IS NO BRIGHT COLORS OR REALLY ANYTHING FOR MY DAUGHTER TO PLAY WITH, SHE HATES IT. NOT TO MENTION THAT THE MOBILE THAT CAME WITH THE BOUNCER SEAT IS RIGHT IN HER FACE. ITS NOT WORTH THE $50. THE OCEANS AQUARIUM ONE IS MUCH BETTER.."
3,Consider This.....,"I bought this bouncer after being seduced by its cushy soft appearance and mosquito net option (which I only used once). I do like the fact that it reclines at 2 levels (adjusted by a zipper). The lower pretty much converts it into a bassinet (which I've used traveling). However, the higher one is still a tad too low for my baby to see what's going on. The hanging toys are useless - only block baby's view. But probably the most important consideration: my baby is only 4 months old, 27 inches long and he's already outgrowing it. I'm shopping for another bouncer with an open foot area right now........"
2,Careless Shipping ruined product,I purchased this gift for some friends. I wanted to wrap it nicely as I recieved many Babies R' Us Amazon wrapped gifts for my own shower and thought I would have a better shot at doing it myself. The box arrived totally smashed and unwrappable. There was a slash right down the middle of the box as though someone took a razor to it. The gift looked like it had been returned and I bought it off a discount shelf and I was too embarrased to give it to my friends. I am not sure if the product was packaged poorly and it was mishandled... disappointed.
1,Hardly Used,"Looks nice, and I loved the idea of the zipper dome unit, but it's too small. Our baby grew out of it at two months. It's a total waste of money in my opinion."
1,Dissapointed,"I purchased the Eddie Bauer stroller and highchair and I was very impressed, but I was rather dissapointed with this bouncer, it is very cheaply made, very hard on babies back, does not sustain very much weight. The toys above the hood are horrible, they got in my sons face a lot. Very hard to move from place to place. I gave it a one because I liked that the little head rest was very soft material."
2,Net gets in the way,"We registered for this bouncer because it was cute and the net on it seemed helpful. However, the net just got in the way. It doesn't fold under or go anywhere when your not using it so it is right at your baby's feet. Our son was a big baby (he has stayed above the 95% since one month old). He would get his feet caught in the net once he started kicking and moving around more. Also, the vibrations hardly work. My son loved vibrations (he had one on his bassinet) but this one didn't seem to do much. The folding feature is overrated. It does get flat, but is difficult to keep together to carry and kind of bulky.I guess if you have a small baby this would be ok, but if your baby is over 19-20 inches at birth (my son was 21""). I'd say pass on the Eddie Bauer bouncer."
2,Not impressed,If you're looking for a seat that baby can kick and play and have a good time this is NOT the seat for you! If you're looking for a seat for baby to sleep in this IS the seat for you. I was looking for a seat to keep baby occupied while I took a shower or cooked dinner and this one was terrible for that. My 6 week old couldn't get comfortable in the upright position and her head would slant way down if she even moved her body a little bit because the seat is too straight up and stiff. When its time to sleep she goes in her crib so I didn't even really use the bassinet part of it. Overall this chair is not practical for a playful happy and wiggly baby which most are! I ended up returning this for another and it was also much cheaper.
4,Great bouncer for the fussy baby.,"I bought this originally because it closed up with a bug guard and I thought that it was a cute ""bassinet"" like bouncer. I loved it when my daughter was first born. I put it in her crib and she slept great. Now that she is a little bigger I pulled the vibration mechanism off and put it about 12"" below her feet and it vibrates her crib mattress. Works like a dream. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bird/music noise it a little too loud and well sounds more like noise instead of soothing music or nature sounds."
1,do not buy this product!,"We, like many other parents, selected this ""bouncy"" seat since we thought it would be great this summer at the lake to keep the mosquitos off our baby. However, we soon found that she hated this seat because she rolled from side to side. This is because the bottom and back of the seat have a hard board in them which makes the seat rigid instead of like a sling to conform to a baby's body. Also, we felt like the seat always sat too close to the ground and was a little tilted. After some inspection we found that the seat was broken at the hinge that makes it collapse and this was after we had attempted to use it only a few times. Overall it is a poor design except for the netting and I would not recommend this product."
5,A Great Find!!,"I needed something a little more conducive to sleep for my baby. While the other bouncy chairs are great, I wasn't looking for bright colors or toys. No, this purchase was about getting baby to sit still or even stay asleep in the transfer from my arms to bed. I was having issues tranferring her to her crib or my bed and her waking up. Even if she's awake and sits quietly while being 'hummed' to by the vibration for 10 minutes, that buys me time for a shower or grabbing a bite before she starts crying.It's been great since getting this chair. It has two sitting positions, one is clearly for sleeping, which is what I was after."
4,A throne fit for a king,"My newborn gives this bouncer a definite 5 stars. He finds it very comfy, loves the ""rumbler"" (as it gets called in our house), and seems to enjoy the bird sounds also.I am quite pleased with the seat also. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish you could pick the seat up by both ends to transport the baby from room to room in it. If you do that, it will fold up. You have to carry it in the middle, which does not strike me as very safe, so you about have to remove the baby to move it to another room.Other than that, we love the way it reclines so fully for napping, and how soft and comfy the seat is. I'm not sure how thrilling the neutral colored toys are to a baby's eye, but they can easily be interchanged for other toys with brighter colors using some of those little plastic links that you find everywhere."
3,Needs Work,"I bought this because it was a bouncer and bassinet in one. However, my son weighed 9lb. 5oz at birth and by the 4th day of use the bassinet was already ""sinking"" to the floor. Not to mention the hood on top pops off very easily. It is a great neutral color and the concept is good but needs work. The other issue is its portability. Had I kept it, I would have made a bag to transport it in because it is a hassle to move around while folded. Also, the nature sounds are annoying and the vibrate/sound box could be designed better. Overall, it wasn't worth keeping. Hopefully I will find something else that will suit my needs."
2,Not as good as it looks and sounds,My son did not like this at all. The positions were not very comfortable and he grew out of it by 8 weeks. Once his feet touched the end he was not comfortable. It looks nice but you can get another one for less money which the baby enjoys more.Also the battery did not last long.I would have returned it but I threw away the box since it looked so comfortable and good.
3,Nothing but Laying there,"This ""Bouncer"" is soooo pretty. But it does not bounce. I had to go out and purchase a bouncer in addition to this mini bassinet. Also My son was only 6 pounds at birth and he quickly grew out of it by the time he was only 10 or 11 pounds. The outside netting is a great idea, (But not too practical) but he quickly got his little feet all caught up in the netting. He is now three months and 14 ponuds and the bouncer is sitting up in my attic and has been for a few weeks now"
2,This product is OK,"I got this product because it went with everything else I purchase for my now 13 mt old. my son really never liked it, I think that it was too boring for him. There are much better products out there, don't get all caught up in everything matching like I did... go for quality."
2,Not so great...,"We registered for this bouncy seat because we really liked the zip-up net feature as well as the fact that the seat would fold up for travel. Unfortunately, our baby despised this seat, and it took us a while to figure out why. Our baby always seemed to be seated in an uncomfortable position whether buckled in or not. He would last about 2 minutes, then he would squirm and arch his back. I finally figured out that the backing is made of extremely hard cardboard and there is almost no padding! I couldn't blame him! Another feature that we did not like were the fact that the seat did not stay closed when folded, therfore making travel quite difficult. The toys attached to the seat were very bland in color, but I liked the fact that I could remove them and attach toys of my choice with links (a feature you don't find with other seats). We ultimately decided on returning the seat after a month and a half. We have the Ocean Wonders seat now and our little boy seems much happier."
1,"Looks Great, but does not work!!!","I bought this bouncy seat because I loved the way it looked, as well as loved the fact that it had netting to cover my baby when I took her outside. I had put the seat together and when I went to turn it on, the vibration unit did not work. I promptly returned it to the store and got another of the exact same unit. I brought that one home and assembled it on the same day. Again, the vibration unit did not work. I returned it to the store and asked them about this product, as two of the same bouncy seats did not work. The sales associate told me that this is their number one returned item in the bouncy seats and although it looks great, it has been a consistenly returned item from their customers. It was extremely frustrating to have assemebled 2 of the same item with neither of them working. I exchanged it for another bouncy seat by carters and was thrilled with the new seat!"
2,would buy something else if i could,"As a new mom, in my excitement, we opened this up assembled it and threw the box away. Here is why I am disappointed:1. Not very sturdy. Even less than some others of the same price.2. Doesn't stay closed when folded. Yes it is collapsable, but there is no mechanism to keep it closed so everything kind of falls this way and that.3. Really doesn't bounce. Definitely not as much as the others of the same price range.Overall, I like the mesh netting and the vibration feature but if I could return it for something else I would definitely do so. There are better ones for the same price..."
3,Not a bouncer!!! But still good.,This item works wonderful to keep bugs away and for sleepy time. NOT A BOUNCER. Buy something more colorful and with a better weight limit for playtime. It works great if you are going to have to stay somewhere and want your little one in a secure area that you know is not dirty. My son is two months old and has no interest in the toys he prefers the fisher price rocker with the 40lb wight limit. This bouncer is supposed to hold up to 25lbs. My son is 14lbs and in what is supposed to be the seated position on the Eddie Bauer bouncette he is fully reclined. Not good!
2,Kammie&Chinny's Mom,"My daughter is one week old and she absolutely hates this bouncer. When she is placed in the bouncer, she is quiet for about 5 mins, then she starts whining. When we turn on the vibration, she starts wailing! Couple that with the sounds the unit makes, and she cries uncontrollably.Pros-Netting is provided to keep bugs outsoft fabricneutral colorsfolds flat for easy storageback vent for increased air flow when zippedCons-no head rest for smaller babiescannot release belt clips easilyvibrations are too harshsounds are not soothingdoesn't have a handle to carry easilydoes not recline easilyWe will be returning this bouncer in a week if the baby doesn't start liking it!"
2,Too small and too bland,"This is not a great investment. My daughter used it for only about 3 months before she outgrew it. The straps are positioned poorly, so that her feet were hanging out the bottom at three months old, but there was plenty of room above her head. In addition, I had a terrible time unbuckling her. I couldn't squeeze the straps hard enough to get them to release. At one point, I almost thought I was going to have to cut my crying daughter out of it! I also agree with the other reviewer that the bland colors are boring for the baby."
3,It is Just OK,"I use this bouncer for my newborn. I had to put towels on the sides so she could stay upright. The only real reason I bought it was so I could close it up and take her outside. I don't trust it though, she really has no support."
2,Don't Like It,"We registered for the Baby Papasan and were given this instead ""because it's better."" I'm so disappointed with it! Baby is only 8 weeks old (12 lbs., 22""), and she's already nearly too long and heavy for it. She only has a couple of inches to go before her feet are at the edge of the ""lip."" Also, because there's no support at the head end of the bouncer, when I put her in it, that end falls down a few inches. We also have the Fisher Price Learning Patterns Infant-to-Toddler rocker, which both I and she infinitely prefer. This bouncer is all washed-out beige, which a baby can't even see this early. The rocker is much more sturdy and has much brighter contrasting patterns. She coos and loves playing in the rocker. It's $20 cheaper and much better. Check out that bouncer before purchasing this one."
3,worked well but not perfect,I got this as a shower gift and thought it was cute. It works great to keep bugs and pets off of her while outside but is not as soft as I thought it would be. My baby loves it but the back is not very cushioned and I have to put blankets in there to make it comfortable for her. The noise is bothersome to me but my baby likes it so that is all that matters. Over all this is a good bouncer but needs alittle cushion to make it better.
2,Too Small,"I bought this bouncer for my granddaughter because we live in the country and I liked the canopy netting for outside. She is 7 weeks old and just over 9 lbs. and the harness, at its longest setting, fits snugly. If she gets any bigger it will be too small. I cannot see any way a 20 to 25 lb. baby could possibly fit in this if a 10 lb. baby is a tight fit. Its too bad because the other features make for a nice comfortable bouncer for a baby that likes things a little less busy. And, like I said the netting canopy is great for anyone who likes to have baby outdoors a lot without having to worry about insects. I think if they made it a little longer and lengthened the straps on the harness this could be a good buy, but the way it is you can't get much use time before baby gets too big for it."
1,"Cute, but not very practical!!!!","Although the bouncer is cute, it isn't very practical. I used it for both my babies and neither of them enjoyed being in it. I NEVER got the vibrarator to work. The protecting net doesn't close once the baby is in the basinette. It also takes up too much room."
2,I guess I wont keep it afterall,"I only received this great looking bouncer this week. I had seen it at Babies-R-Us and fell in love with the looks....After reading sooooo many negative reviews, reluctantly, I guess I will return it. Have to admit though, there were so many bad reviews that I cynically thought maybe the competition wrote them!! With such upstanding companies sponsoring site, I'm sure there is no chance of that.However, it is too bad this product does not meet the high standards of many other Eddie Bauer products. Maybe they will listen to the reviewers and make some improvements. Thanks to everyone who wrote reviews."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This is a terrible bouncer seat! Here is why:1. The back is HARD AS A ROCK. There is no way I would want to sit/lie on it so why would I make my child?2. The ""nature sounds"" are actually static with a couple of bird-like squeaks.3. At five weeks my daughter only weights 9lbs 2oz and the straps barely fit around her.4. My daughter is only 21.5in long and she barely fits in this contraption.5. The mosquito net that zips around it would be nice if you lived in the Amazon, but for daily use it is just in the way since it is not removable.So to summarize, your money is better spent elsewhere!"
3,only one problem,"I got this item as a baby shower gift, It very nice looking and I like the fact that it folds for easy storage and that you can zip it up to protect babys from insects. It fully reclines so baby can sleep. My son is 2 weeks old and 8lbs 4oz and 21in long, he fits in it fine and sleeps in it fine. The only thing is my nature sound button doesnt work right I hear static more than I hear birds so we dont use the sound if I still had the box I would return it for a new one. Other that my sound mishap I am happy with the bouncer, just make sure if you buy it that it works right before you throw away the box!"
3,Very pretty but be careful,"My daughter never really loved to sit in this chair from day one but I kept trying to here and there and she actually started to like it more recently at five to six months because she could reach the toys to play with. However, the other day, she was sitting in it while strapped in and leaned forward and tipped the whole chair forward and fell on her face with the chair on top of her. She thankfully did not hurt herself but I couldn't believe that the chair would actually flip like that. Although my daughter is six months she is small at only 15 pounds or so and there is no excuse for it to have flipped over."
1,this does not sit up and mine is down to the ground,"THIS IS A WAIST OF MONEY. A BOUNCER SHOULD SIT UP HIGHER I PLACE MY SON IN IT IT GOES TO THE GROUND. I LIKE THE SOUNDS,AND COVER NICE BUT THIS ITEM NEEDS MORE OPTIONS FOR RECLINING."
1,Do not waste you money!,"I agree with many other consumers. This is a huge waste of money. My son HATES it! I have written to the Eddies Bauer company and voiced my opinion, maybe they will discontinue it before fooling any other new mothers. If you buy it for the looks like I did you are a fool! It is just plain AWFUL!"
4,Baby loved it!,"I really think this is a great product. I looked at a lot of bouncers and what really sold me on this one was the fact that it is cocoon-like with a nice high edge all the way around. When the baby was too little to sit up I felt very comfortable stepping away for a moment knowing she wouldn't be rolling out. Also, since the sides were so deep I didn't have to strap her in until she was starting to sit up. Another great idea is that you can enclose the baby by zipping up the netting. Perfect for outdoors! The only thing I would probably change is maybe adding a little color to it for baby's visual interest."
2,not a good bouncer,"I thought this bouncer looked cozy and i liked that it zipped, but my son never liked to sit in it. It did not sit him up at all and we put this away after 3 months because it never got used. Was fine for the first couple of weeks for him to sleep in, but that was all. I will be buying a different bouncer for my next child."
1,Cute But Not A Buy,"We were really disappointed with this bouncer. Really it is just plain BORING. My daughter has not enjoyed it at all. The back is hard and the sounds are horrible! The toys are boring and have no contrast to the bouncer itself. We went out and bought a different bouncer and she loves the new one. It is comfortable, has music and lights and vibrates as well. I would not recommend this bouncer for any baby."
2,Disappointing,"We picked this item out for our registry after looking at it in the store. It seemed great! Our son hates it. The assembly was fairly easy. We were very disappointed with the sounds it came with. It was full of static and we thought it was broken until I read someone else's review that had the same problem. The entire bouncer is awkward to handle whether you are folding it up, storing it, or carrying it somewhere. Perhaps I am not used to these new models of bouncers but I was certainly not impressed with this one."
1,not comfortable,"my baby is a little on the big side. when i put her in this chair i cant strap her in. she rolls to the sides and gets stuck, because the back is flat and doesn't hold her. be careful she has rarely used this chair and the plastic rod that gives the netting its shape on the bottom is now poking out. i never saw it until it scraped her cheek.i will be calling the company about it as soon as i'm done writing this.oh yeah the vibration bearly moves the chair. good luck"
2,Not much bounce for the buck!,"I received this item as a gift for my daughter. There is really no ""bouncing"" involved...just vibrating and some background sound. The incline is at a uncomfortable angle and really can't be used until baby is able to hold her head up a little. We've used it some but would not reccomend it to anyone else."
3,Just OK,"I registered for this bouncy seat becuase my baby was due in June. I thought I would use it outside a lot. I liked that you could fully enclose the seat with the mesh netting. It was also nice that it vibrated and had sounds. I found it convenient that it folded up as well. At first I loved it. I even bought it as a gift for someone else. Then after using it only about 4 times, the vibrating would no longer work. I put new batteries in and it still would not work. Finally I called the company and 6 weeks (or more)later I received a new part. I was hoping to get more use out of the seat at that point, but again after a few uses the new part would not vibrate. I also found that even though it folded it didn't have a strap or anything to hold it together in the folded position. The toys are also hard to reach, therefore it is kind of boring for an active baby. I ended up returning the seat for a different one. I am happy that I did."
2,My 11 week old baby has out grown it,"I didn't register for a bouncy seat because my sister-inlaw said she would give me the one her daughter outgrew. I wish I would have looked into this one because she is already too big for this one at 11 weeks. They need to make it longer. Also it doesn't seem to be very strong, it goes down pretty far when I put her in it. I have never been able to unzip it so that she can lay down in it, because it is already pretty lower. I am going today to find another"
2,disappointed,"I rec'd this as a shower gift and was very excited when I rec'd it from my registry. Unfortunatedly, putting it together was a pain and when we did it was crooked, one of the rods was 1/4 to 1/2 inch longer than the right side so it sat off-kilter...also I didn't realize that in order for the baby to sit up in it, she must be zipped in. I was disappointed..."
2,Not a Favorite,"I was so excited when I registered for this bouncer. I had visions of my baby and I spending long hours over her first few months outside with her napping comfortably in her bouncer. Not so! She never really liked being in here, she would only sit for a few minutes at a time. The seat is very wide and did not contour to my daughter's body. She seemed much more comfortable in seats that were more shaped to fit her. Even when I swaddled her, she would still roll around in awkward positions."
2,Not what I expected,"I loved this bouncer when I first saw it. However, it pretty much fell apart. When my Daughter was 4 weeks old and laying in this, she would tilt the entire thing. When I laid her done in it, the thing would almost collaspe. The Vibration part didn't last long, I was changing batteries every few days! The bird chirping was so low, you could hardly hear it.After those first couple of weeks, we went out and bought a less expensive bouncer and she's still using it and she's 6 months old :)"
2,You can get something better for your money!,"I bought this bouncer because I figured Eddie Bauer was a good brand and it looks very nice. Come to find out just because it has the name doesnt mean its always a good product. I bought this product for my infant and she liked it at first it was the only place she would sleep in. Well she's 3mts. now and the reclining part doesnt seem to stay up she's 10 pounds and when i put her in it goes back down to the last notch and she just cries,she doesnt like it. So i bought the papasan bouncer by fisher price and its the best product in bouncer and swing i would recommend if you want comfort for your baby you will go with the papasan."
1,We have 3 bouncy seats this is the worst one,"I agree with everyone else.....vibration died after only a few times. Toys are too close to baby's eyes...he is going to be cross eyed if I let him stay in there...there is no head support..baby rolls to one side usually wear the bear is.which is where they get 1 star since my son likes the bear...you can't get him in & out without having the toys hit him so soon enough my son will hate the bear since he keeps clocking him on the head & then this item will get no stars! I would not advise getting this bouncy. I got 2 at my shower & was going to return this one since I didn't register for it. I thought I would use it, but wish I had returned it!"
3,Not the best out there,"I saw this and thought WOW this would be perfect for the fact I have cats and this would keep them out of the way from the baby. I did not want to zip up my daughter all the time and she did not really like sitting in it. She grew out of it waaayy to quickly and I ended up purchasing the Fisher Price Aquarium bouncy seat instead. She loves this and keeps her entertained where as the other one is just a quiet place to sit or sleep. The fisher price one she can sleep in it, it vibrates it make noise the fish move. I just did not think this seat was all it was cracked up to be. The fisher price one was $15 cheaper too! Although the nice thing about the Eddie Bauer seat is you can take it outside and it has a cover to protect baby from the sun and it folds up nicely."
2,should have gone with my gut,"i had originally registered for the kick and play bouncer but changed my mind when i saw how nice and soft this one was. i also loved the fact that it could zip up and keep bugs out.however, when my baby actually use it for the first time, i realized i might have made a mistake. like others have stated, the colors aren't very stimulating, it doesn't realy ""bounce"", and it's very reclined. making it good for napping perhaps, but not for play. also, though my baby's only 4 wks old and under 10 lbs. i'm not sure how well this thing will hold up once he's a bit bigger. the back seems to be nothing more than a flimsy piece of cardboard.in any case, i'm going to be returning this this next week and getting the kick and play as i'd originally planned."
2,Not the best built bouncer,"My husband and I received this as a gift and while we loved the zippered netting, the rest of the bouncer wasn't so great. Our son always managed to kick the vibrating part off of the bouncer. And, when he was lighter, that part would vibrate itself right off. We didn't like it much and ended up not using it very often. I'd recommend something with the vibrating part affixed to the seat and not removeable."
1,Fell apart on me,"First of all, after assembling the bouncer, the base wouldn't stay together which I felt was dangerous. When I returned it, the BRU manager told me never to buy the Eddie Bauer name stuff because ""it is a piece of sh*it."" Her words, not mine. Secondly, my daughter hated it! She had one that was more of a sling fit that we leave at my mom's house that she really liked. I think part of the reason she didn't like this one so much was because the back is so flat. We returned this one and bought the bright stars glide and play bouncer which she absolutely loves."
2,Not the greatest,"This is more of a massager than a bouncer. Although it is great for putting her to sleep, I find that my little girl is constantly rolling to the side from the vibrating, even on the lowest speed. With the vibrating off she still seems to end up in uncomfortable positions. I have yet to listen to the sounds so no review on those. It is a pain to pick up and move because the bar never snapped in place so everytime we move it, it comes apart. The netting is great for being outdoors but i dont want to use it indoors and the top part doesnt stay up unless you use the netting so she cant look at the toys (which are cheap anyway) Not a great product and i would not recommend."
3,- Looks Nice But Keep Shopping -,"We got 2 of these ""bouncers"" for our twins before they were born. I loved the neutral color and style of this item. I liked the net idea, too. But I never used it. My twins are now almost a year old and these bouncers have been collecting dust in their closets for months now. They were ok for the first few months...until I realized there were better products out there. This bouncer does have a great vibrating feature. And it reclines a great amount, so it's good for napping. But as far as fun, I would have to say it's non-existent. It's quite boring, there's nothing to it. No colors, 3 boring attached toys, no music and the sounds aren't the greatest. I would not recommend this to anyone who is looking for a fun type of bouncer. I would highly suggest a kick-n-play type of thing or the Leap Frog Magic Moments Learning Seat, my twins still love that. But if you are looking for something with a massaging feature that's great to nap in, this will work for you."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"This was a waste of $50. The music is TOO Loud and way too annoying. My son is only 24 inches in length & 13 pounds at 3 months and has already outgrown the restraints and the length of the seat. The toys are not brightly colored and uninteresting to him. I hung different ones, but if you push the canopy back, they dangle on his head. The netting is not removable - I was hoping to use it this summer outside, but he has already outgrown it. If I'd kept the box (dummy me), it would have gone back to the store! Now it has to go in the garage sale or to the consignment store or on Ebay. When I bought this there were no reviews on it...hope this helps you!"
1,Not confortable at all,I think this a waist of money. The canopy just make the entire bouncer not comfortable for the baby. Also my baby was 2 months 14 lbs. when I had to retire this bouncer. My son was too big and felt very uncomfortable in it. The music is not appealing either. I was very unhappy with this product.
1,Better choices out there,"My daughter received this bouncer from an aunt. We tried sitting her in it a number of times, but she never liked it. It didn't look very comfortable for her, and the ""nature sounds"" were a bit annoying. We ended up putting it away--we should have taken it back to the store, but we waited too long. Although she didn't like this bouncer, she *loves* her Baby Papasan. Couldn't live without that one! Overall, the Eddie Bower bouncer just isn't worth the money."
2,disappointed,"My son is 6 weeks old and hates sitting in this bouncer. Even at a week old, his arms would hit the sides and his feet hit the bottom. He would instantly wake up and begin crying.. I would not purchase this product and am going to return it."
2,not really everything I hoped for,"We got this one because it matched our crib set, and the enclosed area for baby to be in seemed like a good idea. To be perfectly honest, it will be nice for outside, when our daughter is napping. Otherwise, the nice $20 bouncer from Walmart is her preference. Once she could see, she hated it, because she could not see her surroundings. Had we known this from day one, we would have gone with one more reasonably priced instead of geting this one, then having to go out and buy a bouncer she would tolerate."
1,This bouncer is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this bouncer for my son because of all the positive reviews. My son HATED it from day 1. The part the baby lays on is so hard..Its doesnt sling the body like the fp Kicknplay. My son always rolls to one side. There is no incline-when I lay him down inside his feet are higher then his head. It dosn't bounce at all! Also if you have a big baby like I do, he/she will grow out of it FAST. There is no leg room. Save your money and go for something tried and true like the Fisher Price bouncers-And they're cheaper!!!! I wish I would have saved the packaging to return it."
2,Boring Bouncer,My daughter only used this bouncer until she was 2 weeks old. She now screams if I put her into it. The seat is very stiff and not very comfortable. She would slide sideways b/c the seat is so stiff that I had to put rolled up blankets to hold her straight up. The only positive about this bouncer is the zipp up netting that provides protection from insects if you bring your baby outside. The color is soothing but also boring for baby. I should have purchased an activity bouncer for her entertainment instead b/c this bouncer does not sooth her or entertain her.
2,Not as practical as it looks,I registered for this bouncer because our daughter was going to be born before the summer months and we have cats in the house hold and did not want them to get into the bouncer. However in order for it to vibrate you have to have the sounds (nature) on which is really annoying and it turns on even if you bump it. The attachments are too close the the childs face when sitting up.
3,Lyrical but Insubstantial,"It's odd to see ""Moon's Crossing"" compared with ""The Devil in the White City."" While the former is a dreamy, drifty meditation on the intertwined lives of several fictional characters at various time periods, the latter is written in a much more straightforward style and based on actual events and people. They share a setting, the ""White City"" of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, and they roughly share some themes, perhaps, but they are very different styles.I found ""Moon's Crossing"" beautiful and poetic, but ultimately unsatisfying. The book constantly switches between characters, and while the transitions were well done, some of the characters weren't that interesting. I found myself wishing that we could just stay with Moon. But Moon's own lack of direction made his character hard to enjoy. If Croft could wrap her lyrical prose around some more substantial characters, I'd love to read her next novel."
5,great book,I enjoyed reading this book by a talented author. Croft takes the reader through a series of events form the farm house of Iowa to the Brooklyn Bridge and back againRon Sanzone
3,More of the White City but different,"I read this after Eric Larson's The Devil in the White City and Alec Michod's The White City. I still needed more of the white city. I liked this novel but I wasn't always certain about what the author was trying to convey. I was a bit confused by the relationship between the police officer investigating Moon's death and the young woman referred to as Moon's 'widow'. I thought that the book jacket said there was an unexpected romance between the two but it didn't read like romance to me. I liked the way Moon and the woman were connected. I really like the way Croft writes about Nick, I thought she did a great job depicting him. I thought it was good but not fantastic and after this one I finally had my fill of the white city."
2,Confusing!!!,This book was really confusing. I had to read this book twice in order for me to understand what was going on. There is about five main characters in this book. This book goes back and forth between the past and the future. I recommend Devil in the White City instead.
5,A classic account of Persian History,"The encyclical accounting of the Persian Empire. Olmstead was the first author to give an account of the Persians from their perspective. He begins well before Cyrus the Great and runs through the entire Achaemenid period recounting the conquest and administration of the empire until its demise by Alexander's onslaught. Olmstead goes into exceptional detail in giving accounts of the inscriptions and palace mural carvings at the ruins of Persepolis and other locales. His account of Zoroaster is also noteworthy from a liturgical perspective, though the dating of Zoroaster's life has changed since Olmstead passed away in 1945. Overall, a fantastic exposure to the Persian Empire. Best read in conjunction with one or two later works to optimally digest newer discoveries and conclusions."
3,Be Careful,"Olmstead's book is now rather out of date, so should not be anyone's main source. Given the claim above that the ""author"" has posted a comment, it might be worth noting that Olmstead was dead before the book's initial publication."
5,"Serious, yet simple. Buy it; you will not regret it.","I am still in the cooking experimentation stage (read: I usually have no clue when it comes to cooking). I love food and my philosophy has always been 'genius lies in simplicity.' This book epitomizes that philosophy. I have tried several recipes and to my utter surprise, not only were they easy, but also tasted great ! I highly recommend this book."
4,"Took a while, but as expected","This item took a few weeks to arrive. There was no tracking number which made it hard to know where the item was, or if it was due to be delivered. The book arrived a few days after the last date suggested for expected delivery, and was in the condition as advertised."
5,The perfect cookbook,"I have tried several recipes from this book throughout the past year and have been thrilled with the results. While I can't remember the exact names of the dishes, my favorites include Dean & Deluca's version of the basics-the chili, the meatloaf, the chicken soup, the tomato sauce. I think I have made the chicken pot pie at least a dozen times. When it comes to a bit more complicated fare, I found the paella to be extraordinary--and one of the easiest paella recipes I have found to follow. It's really a lot of fun, as far as cookbooks go."
3,"great recipes, lousy binding","I hate to judge a book by its binding, but with a cookbook, even a paperback...you expect it to hold together for more than two uses. The recipes here are caloric, innovative, challenging and delicious. But the book falls to pieces quickly and it's all downhill from there. Maybe a spiral next time? Anything would help.great content."
5,In a more academic approach...,"This one is different than any other aquaculture books around, since it has more academic and scientific approach to the subjects.Everything(and years of experience)explained in straight formal way with scientific charts, graphs and results.So it is not an ""easy reading"" or ""read and forget"" book.IMO a hobbyist should not try to finish the volume at once, but refer through different chapters when needed.A must have if you are really really want to get educated about aquaculture as a hobbyist, or a student."
3,"Great, except...",These are terrific for listening to music (I have an LG Voyager w/ 8 GB micro SD). But when a call comes in I have a hard time hearing myself. It may be that I haven't found the right button...but people can hear me while to me I sound muted.
2,Dissappointed,"I bought this headset and it worked well . . . for about 4 hours. The right earphone suddenly lost all it's bass and about 2/3 of the volume. I sent it in for servicing, and when I got it back, it worked fine again until after the first charge. Now the sound is fuzzy, periodically drops off, and sometimes sounds as if it were being played by a tape recorder with low batteries. I have no idea why it would do this, but I'm rather disappointed.I bought this for watching movies and listening to music around the house, as well as skype calling. I think I'll just buy a decent set of headphones with a cord extension."
5,Impressed Me!,"I tried this with a Sprint Sanyo M1 Mobile phone and was amazed at the clarity of my phone calls. You can put your phone on the charger and talk on it with stereo sound for hours! I tested the range and I could clearly talk for about 25 feet. The plastic on the headband looks somewhat cheap, but I will try my best to take care of it."
2,Music Cuts Out Intermittently,"The audio quality was acceptable and pairing was easy. But the audio cuts out intermittently. Plantronics tech support suggested I remove the battery from the Sony Ericsson w580i with which the device was paired to eliminate the possibility of a static bubble around the phone's battery. That didn't fix the problem. I've paired my phone with other bluetooth stereo devices without this problem, so I'm pretty sure it's a problem with the Plantronic headphones, not my phone.Two possibilities occur to me: (1) the sampling rate on my music might be more than the headset can handle, or (2) the unit might have a weak front end and, thus, be unacceptably susceptible to RF interference from other electronic devices. To their credit, Plantronics offered to replace the headset, but I suspect this isn't a device manufacture issue, so much as a design flaw."
2,not what I had hoped,solid construction poor design of a few items buttons difficult to get the right one without taking the headset off to find the buttons and the charger connector is small and inadequate falls out easily and headset stopped taking a charge after a few uses had to send it back sound quality was excellent and the headset reception was good. Could not recommend for the charger design itself would be nice if this charged via usb
3,Can You Hear Me Now? I dont think so.,"Paired w/LG Fusic very easy , ""Fusic wont streem MP4 ,has to be mp3,acc or wma files. couldnt use any of my I-Tunes music and had to re-rip my hard copies ,back to disk as wma""s and then it would streem.Stereo Sound is above average,But if your used to an I-Pod and wired Headphones , Get ready to be disapointed. I thought that the base was a bit booming and steps on the midrange,and at lower volumes the delicate highs are all but lost.And if you like the Plantronics niose canceling wired headsets get ready for another major disapointment. the sound of voice calls is ""BAD"" as in 2 tin cans and a string would be an inprovement. ""Tunnel Sound"" in both ears. And the microfone is not noise canceling,It picks up everything except your voice. The only thing that is great is the range of the Fusic when paired with these headphones is outstanding ,30+ feet. through walls no problem. As long as your in a quiet place they are great."
3,Bluetooth Headset,"The headphones work, but the battery life seems fairly low. Also, the headset isn't very comfortable."
2,"Works, but quality isn't great","The headset works as advertised. I've paired it with my MacBook Pro as both a headset and headphones. When listening to iTunes music, however, there's a persistent hiss in the background. Additionally, the controls are in an awkward location and require you to push too hard to activate the buttons. I shouldn't have to crush my ear to play/pause the music.It's also annoying that the power adapter isn't a more standard plug type. A mini-USB plug would be great since that would allow the headphones to be charged by plugging them into a USB port. That's handy when you're overseas and have a limited set of international power adaptors."
2,Plastic breaks easily,Bought this head phone when it was still over $100. Both sides of the headset the plastic broke off. Not worth the price even at $60. If it was more durable it would be a good headset. It didnt last very long. Now its being held together by tape. I use it for gaming
4,Not Bad,"I bought this from Amazon after trying out Insignia and LG HBS-200. This works ok with my laptop and cellpone (treo 680 and Sony Ericsson w580i). However I will not rate this excellent. Bluetooth setup with Sony was easy, but not that easy with Treo 680/Softik Audio Gateway. I had to call the customer support for setup. Several reboots were required. It works well with Phone and Streo player. I used Windows media player from laptop and Pcoket Tunes from treo and Sony software from W580i. However it has connection problems once it changes to phone mode while listening to Music. May be AVRCP is not that good. I had to reset it or try the controls from the Phone to start playing again. Sound quality is good with music and OK with phone conversations. LG HBS-200 was the best in both count and it swiched between phone and music player automatically. However LG HBS-200 has serious design flow, it broke on the right ear side first followed by the left side. Otherwise I still like the LG."
2,not impressed,"I'm using this headset with a Dell laptop; the sound is not all that good, there is an occasional lag, and I have yet to figure out how to make the mic work.Perhaps Bluetooth headsets have a little ways to go yet in development; I also use a bluetooth mouse with this laptop, and I've realized since trying to use this headset that there is a lag to get bluetooth devices going with the PC, which is something I've never noticed when using an ear bud with my cell phone."
2,I wanted to love this headset,"Very nice audio, flawless linking, BUT . . . all of this is pretty irrelevant if the device doesn't do that for long. Wanting to get a lightweight, stereo headset with well-reviewed audio, I took a chance that those who said it broke or stopped working were just the unlucky few. I have to count myself as another, as my headset stopped charging after a few months of moderate use and delicate handling. I advise readers of this review to take careful note of the relatively high number of people saying that their headsets failed after moderate amounts of use. I wish you better luck if you too take the chance."
2,Battery Failure,I bought this unit about 15 months ago and had not used it for about six months as my iPhone did not support stereo. Now that it does I attempted to use it. It will not take a charge. I contacted Plantronics and they indicated the warranty was for 13 months so I am out of luck. Seems a battery should last longer than a year or so. Plantronics indicates the battery is not replaceable so my only option is to buy a new one. Think I will look for a more reliable brand.
2,Not enough volume - too tight on the head,"The build quality seems good and the sound quality as well but I could not get enough volume for music with my HTC Touch Pro. After about 15 minutes, I could not handle the pain on my ears. They are just too tight for my head."
4,All good so far...,"I am generally pleased with the headset, I wear it about 7 hours a day and it is fairly comfortable. The flashing blue light reflects into my reading glasses but, like kids, one tends to tune it out. Sound quality is fine, range is very good, and the microphone is clear and doesn't garble my voice."
5,Finger and Toe gauze,"This is an excellent product for anyone who has overlapping toe problems. I use them on every other toe to keep the nails from cutting into the toe next to it, and the gauze protects any damage to my twisted arthritic toes. Great product."
