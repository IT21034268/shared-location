1,FAKE COPY. DO NOT ORDER.,"I saw this dvd in an Indian store but decided not buy it at the time, the shop keeper was charging $20 for it which isn't bad but I wasn't sure. Found it on here for a cheaper price and decided to order it. Well this copy is fake. I saw the real copy in the Indian store, which had a cardboard type case and had the Reliance proof of authenticity sticker. This dvd came in a plastic case with an entirely different picture on the cover."
2,Poor Cheap Copy,"Another recent attempt by Bollywood to copy Western action crime thrillers. Same, misdirection plot lines, where people unrealistically think and plan for all the most unlikely outcomes like they have some omniscient insight into the future (more remarkable when it also includes human decision making). Movie copy of decades old car chase scenes, shoot outs, double crosses, crime capers that have been far surpassed in recent cinema. Example: The French, the masters of car chase scenes, would laugh at those scenes in this movie.Bollywood - either film expand on your rich diverse culture or encourage imaginative/creative thinking in your educational systems."
3,GEMINI ACCESS Recoil 10 ft. Multi-Platform Extension Cable,This extension works good with the original controllers (PS2 and GameCube) but not with the dancing pad it does not work at all. To Bad!!
1,"Junk, junk, junk...","First snow of the season. This thing is worthless. I had to partially disassemble it after I tested it (right out of the box)to put the belt back on the pulley mechanism. Then, the first patch of powder snow I tried caused the belt to slip off again. You can tell by the screeching sound (like a vacuum cleaner roller getting jammed). If you run it a little without moving snow, the plastic scoop blade will gradually start to turn. It won't stand to any depth of snow. Well, maybe an inch or so of powder. If you need to move a few inches and have to pass over it a few times it becomes difficult to keep holding the unit and keep your hand on the control switch. Gets tiring quickly, especially when you think how much easier it would be just to use a shovel.Can't believe anyone uses this, let alone like it. Now, what's Toro's address..."
4,Shovel Plus,"Have not used the brush, yet, but does an excellent job on the snow! Easy to handle, powerful, and light weight."
3,Does what its intended,"I purchased the snow shovel for my Mom who is 66 years old. She would not normally ""shovel"" the driveway. She found the Toro to be a very helpful machine with the snow we had overnight (""14 inches"") she cleared about 90% of the two car driveway. She liked it. It was not good for the heavy snow that the plows had put in front but it was adequete and better than lifting a shovel. As long as the snow is soft and there isn't a head wind in your working direction it is a nice little machine to replace shoveling. My Mom would NEVER use a big snow thrower but this is manageable, easy to store and can do a good job in most conditions. I had heard that Toro's first batch of these new models were recalled because of problems. I waited for the new batch which didn't arrive until after Christmas to get mine. I had spoken to a couple of Toro dealers who told me to wait on the new shipment."
1,so far so useless,"Didn't snow yet so I don't know hw it would work for snow shovelling but for sweeping dirts from my deck and driveway, it's totaly useless. Now I have to buy a traditional broom to do that job.Generally speaking, this is a bulky, hard to install hard to maneuver tool that do much less job than expected.Highly not recommended."
4,GREAT LITTLE SNOW SHOVEL,"After trying to get this item from Amazon to no avail I gave up and bought it off of Ebay.It is small, light weight and easy to manage. You can use it on your deck, walkway, drive way etc.I would prefer if this item was not electric and was gas powered, dragging around an extension cord is annoying.Other than that, I love it!"
4,Since FINALLY shipped much higher opinion,"(...) Found the lower handle very hard to install - not enough gap for electrical cord between 2 handle segments - found it most powerful in our first very heavy, wet three inches mixed with mud, but doubt its potential service life as no small wheels installed to act as fulcrum to raise it off exposed aggragate concrete and asphalt and I doubt the plastic housing and blades will last long on such surfaces and would be most helpful to us with bad backs and torn rotator cuffs (reason for buying !!!) Threw this slush/muck more than 15 feet with no taxing of motor - would better rate at end of season!"
5,Great little snow thrower,My husband bought the Toro snow shovel 20 years ago. It got a lot of use and finally broke down last year. It is great for 4 or 5 inches of accumulation and will handle more if taken off in layers. It is well worth the money.
4,i'm satisfied,"i'm satisfied with this product. some people posted negative comments, some posted positive comments. for me i found this product to do all of what i wanted and expected it to do. it's a little heavy and a little back-achey but i figure it's got to be a WHOLE lot less back-achey than having to lift and heave the snow with human muscle. i clear the area around my back porch door of 6"" to one foot of snow so i can scoop it away with my snow plow. it's not a huge area, maybe 100 or so sq. ft., it's a lot easier than shoveling it by hand. i'm thoroughly satisfied with the performance of this product."
2,Not too smart,"The product has an amazing show shoveling power. The problem is it just pushes the snow ahead of you. So you really have to do some adjustments to actually clean a sidewalk. Only worth while if you have a big lawn to ""shovel"" the snow off to."
3,Good for something??,"I purchased this item in October of 2006 from Amazon and that winter we had some light snow a couple of times that I tried to use this for.Well, I discovered that for any snow over 6 inches deep it was faster just to grab my shovel and push the snow off of my driveway and sidewalk.In the last week we have had two storms move through, with a third on the way, that have dropped about one to two feet of snow per day. I pulled this thing out again, hooked up the long extension cord, and tried to use it again. No good, so I had to grab the shovel again.This might work if you need to only clear off 1"" to 2"" of of fresh ""dry powder"" snow, but for anything deeper, use a snow shovel or a gas powered snow blower."
5,Powerful little Snow Shovel!,"It did exactly what I wanted it to do. I am using it for a small space and it is very powerful much better than I expected. Only used it for snow as that is all I wanted it for, but it certainly did it's job. Purchased it for $75 and free shipping. Best $75 I ever spent!"
4,Great for Smaller Snow Falls,"The Toro Power Shovel works great in snows of less than 6"", and you must always remember to shovel downwind because the snow is blown straight ahead. There is no way to adjust the direction, but after getting snow blown in your face one time, remembering the downwind piece is not hard! Also, if the snow is compromised by ice (due to freezing rain or sleet), it doesn't work quite as well. However, even with its limitations, for smaller snow falls the Toro Power Shovel beats hand shoveling!"
2,not doing the job,"I thought this was my answer to snow removal however, It just didnt do the job on my 3 car wide driveway, I used it twice and I looked like a snowman , just snow blowing everywhere, hand shovel works much better, or would invest in a smaller gas powered snowblower"
1,Toro Power Shovel,"This tool is simply one that should never have gone to market. It is probably designed as well as it can realistically be, but an electric shovel capable of lifting snow up and to the side can never be light enough for doing steps. It blows snow up and ahead, not to the side. Leaves a mess behind and the user looking like a ghost. I was willing to suffer the awkwardness of an electric cord if it would have helped my wife be able to handle walk clearing in my absence. But it doesn't. A real shovel is only slightly more work and slightly slower, and much less aggravation. Have tried this now on snow from depths of 1"" to 8"", wet and ""dry"".The OSHA-inspired button that can't be set to stay on without constant squeezing (in cold weather) makes this tool even more difficult to use by an elderly person.Forget this one.Paul McGuire, Ann Arbor, Michigan"
1,Someone liked this thing?!,"Much too small and weak for even 4"" of fluffy snow.I gave up and used my shovel.There is no way to direct the snow coming out. Mostly it sent the snow up at a 40 degree angle so it could blow back on me.It's worthless on the little 1/2"" high strips of packed snow made by my car tires on the driveway, and it caught on them too.I can't imagine the electric motor would last very long.It's very narrow so you have to make many passes.Using a cord in the snow presents problems too. Now my cord needs to be cleaned off."
1,Bad merchandise,"I have a Toro Power Shovel, last year we had a mild winter and my husband had open heart surgery, I didn't use it and this winter the first time I used it, it seized up. I took it apart and the plastic rotor part that the belt rotates on was melted to the plastic the machine was made out of. I worked on it for an hour or so, used a scewdriver to separated the seized area and took it back outside and it did the same thing. I am very disappointed in Toro, for making a power shovel, that is anything but a POWER SHOVEL. Bah Humbug to Toro!"
1,Only works with 1-2 inches of snow - BEWARE,We purchased this to use on our deck and it would not work with over 2 inches of snow.
2,Not a bad product but I wouldn't really recommend it,"If all you have is a small (and I mean small) driveway, or your driveway gets plowed and you just need to shovel a walkway this might be fine but for any real amount of snow, it's not worth it. Next season we will be buying a regular snow blower. The cord gets in the way, you always have to move it around. It does such a small area at a time that it hardly saves time. It doesn't work well with wet, heavy snow. and because it throws the snow only directly in front, it limits how you can use it if you live where you aren't allowed to blow snow into the street. I usually use it for half the driveway and then hand shovel the rest."
4,awsome,this shovel works great.I have only had the chance to use it once but it was heavy wet snow and this shovel peformed awsome.It threw snow 20-30 feet off my back porch.
1,"Don't buy it, save up for a blower","First snow of the season 8-10"". I did what was recommended and took the snow off a layer (4""?) at a time. THis thing aint light! And after 5 minutes the belt slipped off and it wouldn't throw anything. I returned mine for a refund."
1,Junk,"I had the same experience as most of the reviewers. FIRST time used, my wife was attempting to take 4"" of powder snow off the deck. It ran for about 2 minutes, and then siezed up. I opened the service cover, and discovered the belt had come off the cheap plastic track. It looked like there was some spindle damage. I took it to my ""authorized Toro dealer"" who is attempting to fix it right now. I can't believe it will last. Stay away from this thing !! This one came from Amazon. Maybe they are all part of a bad batch, but the results are scary."
4,Blessing for NYC snow storms,"My husband being a NYC Sanitation worker abandons me when there is the slightest threat of snow. When the storm does arrive, I am left to shovel 2 driveways, walkways and sidewalks as we own two homes. This item literally saved my back! The snow only throws forward so be sure to plan where you throw it so you dont do double the work or agitate a neighbor!!"
1,Save Your Money,I used this snow shovel today for the first time. We have about 6 inches of snow and all this shovel did was blow the snow in my face. I've packaged it up and UPS is coming to take this worthless piece of junk back to Amazon!
1,Same problem,"Ditto to S. Taylor's problem. After just a few minutes of first-time use, the scoop stopped spinning. It gets disengaged from the motor spindle and actually strips some of the plastic off, so it just gets worse and worse. My friend with the same model had the same problem right off the bat. According to Toro, there's a technical service bulletin on this and you can bring it to an authorized Toro dealer for repair."
3,Hard to handle,I just think it need wheels on it. It is hard for some of us with bad backs to carry around all the time.Attachable wheels would be a Huge improvement.
3,No good for sweeping,"I hope this unti does better at throwing snow than it does sweeping. I can use a push broom faster than using the toro, plus it creates wind and seems to swirl the dirt. Three stars for now."
1,Do not buy it!,"I got it for my husband, and we had a little dust snow and It just stopped working! It worked for 20 minutes. only throws the snow forward and it broke too fast!"
3,Murder In Vegas,"Murder in Vegas edited by Michael Connolly was a fun read, but not in the category of a Connolly book. That being said, it was a nice little break with short stories which were a good break from the novels I've been reading.Another fun book purchased from Amazon Kindle ."
2,Conglomoration of stupid stories,"A really dumb conglomoration of stupid stories, I have no idea why Michael Connelly would associate his name with this?"
3,Murder in Vegas,"I rated this low because it does not compare to Michael Connelly's other books.You of course, have nothing to do with his writing.Everything else rates high.Thank you."
1,Not a Michael Connelly Book,I was truely disappointed with this book. It is not a Michael Connelly Book. I didn't have a chance to read the reviews so I bought it for my kindle and wish that I had tried a sample. This a compilation of short stories that are not very good.
1,"Misrepresented, majority of short stories not by Connelly",I was very disappointed to find this book was not written by Connelly. They used used his name to sell a collection of stories by authors who wouldn't sell without his name. I have only read a few so far. They were so bad that I haven't had any desire to finish the book.
5,Edited by the master,"If Connelly likes it, I am pretty sure his fans will like it too! I enjoy short stories, and there id one of the editor's thrown in for good meaure."
3,It's okay,"Again, this is edited by Michael Connelly (Harry Bosch series) not written by him. Some of the stories are very good, most are so-so but no stinkers."
3,murder in vegas,"although I am a big fan of Michael Connelly, this was not his usual great novel.it did keep my interest, some were better stories than others. not a disappointment...just not his best."
2,Meh!,Seems like Michael had some time and used it to spin out some stories that seem to lack whatever it is that I have come to expect from him.
5,Connelly I crave his works,Connelly has great characters galore. If you see his name on a book grab it. I love it when he is on the TV show Castle.
2,Blah,Normally I love short story anthologies but these aren't very good. Most of them are poorly written and have pointless endings. The good news is that they're bite-size so you don't have to invest a lot of time in them. The bad news is that only a couple of the stories are worth any time at all.
1,My rate on Murder in Vegas.,"I hated the book. The service on the purchase was good, but I did not like the book. I gave it away already.I like the full length novels. Short stories are not for me."
3,Just OK!,"This collection of stories, were not as good as his Harry Bosch or Mickey Haller books. I guess I am just addicted to those, especially Harry Bosch..."
3,Murder in Vegas,"Didn't think the author worked very hard at creating something new and exciting. Usually Connelly's bookhold my attention and I'm fasinated, but this time, not so, just okay."
4,Good introduction but sometimes lacks clarity.,"I purchased this book specifically with a view to learning the Scheme language. The text is easy to read, is pithy and to the point, and generally makes concepts clear and easy to understand. There are however, in my opinion, some sections where the author forgets that concepts are new to the reader and the examples that are used tend to obfuscate the point being made rather than elucidating it.I have never considered myself stupid, but after my 5th reading of the introduction to continuations I was beginning to worry. A quick reading of another text on the subject cleared up my concerns almost immediately which suggests to me that the explanations are not as clear as they could be. There are some other areas of the book where this sort of assumption makes grasping a new concept more difficult than it should be.Nonetheless, I still consider this a good introduction to the Scheme language and would gladly recommend it to the aspirant Schemer."
5,"What about ""The Scheme programming language"" book.","I think the book is not useful as a first book for learning the Scheme language, instead it is very important as a reference. I don't open it very often, but when I need to know something about the language, I do it because I a can find the answer."
2,Not so great... even messier kids,Food slides off of the bib because it's so slippery. Liquid still soaks through. I recommend just buying the cloth with plastic back instead - it works and it's SO much cheaper!
1,Not really what i expected...,"The ""booklet"" it was supposed to come with was a small pamplet, does not really explain much about it or how to use it. The dummy was cheaply made the string broke within the first few days... better as a chew toy..."
3,"Technically correct perhaps, but patients won't understand.","I have spoken Spanish fluently for over ten years and have spent the last four years translating for dental patients and professionals. This book describes dental terms in a way that may be understood by other Spanish dental professionals, but not by your Spanish patients. For example, I have not met a single Spanish-speaking patient who would ever use ""dentadura"" instead of ""placa"" when referring to a denture, and more than 70% of my patients are Latino. The ordering of the phrases is sometimes awkward, such as commonly placing the subject before the predicate in a question, which is usually reversed in Spanish. I'm still looking for a good Spanish Dental Terminology reference."
3,The audio effect is not good,"The CD that came with my book did not seem to be recorded in professional studios. There is backgroud noise and is hard to follow when compared to some other Spanish CDs I studied before. However, I am only a beginner in learning Spanish."
2,"""Milking"" her pregnancy","I thought I'd pick up this book after I had read her last book of poetry (based on some of the interesting reviews here). There is a certain charm and intimacy to the letters which make up this volume, but much of it is over the top in its celebration of all things having to do with reproduction. I guess I have to agree with some of the more unfavorable reviews which pointed out how Fennelly is mining this experience of having kids. Exploiting them to make a buck? Well, I won't go that far, but it sure is keeping her in print.Bottom line---If you need a book to help you feel good about going through pregnancy, then give it a read. Cheerleading for moms is not for everyone though."
1,Won't do slides unless you're willing to unmount them,"Just a heads-up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides. You will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them. Given the verbiage on the box, it caught me as enough of a surprise that I returned the scanner. I'm not OK with deception like that."
3,"Good 4 photos, but not for books","This is a good scanner for photos. But if you want to scan books, it's a bit slow, and difficult to use. You need to really push the book down into the scanner to get a flat image. So if you want to get a book scanner, you are better off getting: Plustek Opticbook 3600 Book Scanner.But for photos it's great. I think the best feature for this product is the you don't need a power cord to scan. The USB option is fantastic."
5,Good scanner,"Doesn't use a power supply, just the usb port. A bit slow but nice scans. Feels a bit fragile and I'll be using it on the road so we'll see how it holds up. So far, so good."
3,Mediocre for document scanning,"I purchase primarily to scan multipage documents to pdf. The multitude of pdf buttons built-in seemed to make this the scanner of choice. Unfortunately, I found the default threshold for B&W; documents to be set too low. It's not possible to adjust this in the Canoscan Toolbox program preferences. There is a work around that requires directly accessing scan driver, but this negates the advantage of having the pdf buttons on the scanner. You can also scan documents as grayscale, but this takes up more memory than necessary for most plain B&W; documents and white background is slightly gray.The hardware is nice, although I don't like the small magnets at the corners of the cover. This is anannoyance when scanning many pages.In summary, doesn't work great if your primary interest is document scanning to pdf."
1,Can't do Slides,"Despite the fact that the description of this item claims that one of its features is:""Multi-image scanning: To save time, simultaneously scan up to 6 frames of 35mm film (negatives or positives)"" the thing can not scan slides (aka 35mm positives). If you are buying a scanner in order to digitize your closet full of negatives and slides, this ain't the one for you. I'm very disappointed in Amazon for allowing such deceptive advertising."
3,Won't do slides - not evident in product description,"I'm sure this is a fine product, but I didn't discover that it doesn't support the scanning of 35 mm slides until I read the users guide after receiving delivery.A 'newbie' mistake, perhaps, but nowhere at Amazon's site is this made clear. Not in the product description nor these user reviews.Hence, I am returning it (reluctantly) and am back at square zero re: getting my old slide collection into digital format. I was hoping to accomplish this task over the holidays."
4,Nice little scanner.,"I had an LiDE30 before and would've kept it except the software didn't work on a Mac with other applications and there wasn't any new software to be found. I've seen the negative reviews on this machine w.r.t. Macs and don't understand why they were written. My unit worked right out of the box with Photoshop Elements. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because, after all, it is a low-end scanner AND I had to give up a perfectly good scanner (albeit same low end) because of the lack of support by Canon for the LiDE30."
1,Terrible for books,"When I tried to scan a large book I had to push down hard in order to scan the area close to the spine of the book. This caused the cheap, plastic, transparent sheet to bend inwards. That, in turn, interfered with the scanner as it moved down the sheet of paper. The end result: profoundly distorted images. I ended up using a photocopier to make a copy of the page and then scanning the copy. Buy something more solidly built."
4,"""Has been great product except in Vista""",Pros: Totally flawless in XPCons: The scan buttons (from the scanner) do not function in Vista even after getting the Vista upgrade driver/software. Canon informed problem still exist.Summary: Awesome scanner except annoying (non-function... read more
4,"works great, but a bit slow",I love my new scanner. It works great but it seems to me to work slower than my previous scanner. But that could be because I have a mountain of pictures to scan.
5,"Don't buy the ""Better Together"" package. It aint.","The scanner works as advertised.I bought the bundle that included a USB cable, guessing that I'd need one since Amazon offered the package. But no, Canon includes the correct cable. The bundled cable has the wrong USB fittings."
2,Disappointed,"Had to return item due to defect in the item. However, it is not the bright red color that I had hoped it would be."
5,bygone era,"I grew up in a small steel town outside of Pittsburgh. I read this book and I knew these folks! I learned to bowl, polka, and drink beer with them. The mills are gone now, some made it out, some didn't. Ms. Monk's stories filled me with bitter sweet memories of a bygone era. Insightful, tragic, funny, and revealing are her characters. Thank you Bathsheba Monk."
5,Insightful and entertaining,"Now You See It is a delightful surprise. There are far too few short story collections coming out of major publishing houses these days, and this book demonstrates why there should be more. It is an insightful look into small town America, written with a wit and lucidity that will make Bathsheba Monk a literary light for years to come."
3,"good, but...","Sharp description and characterization and a strong, consistent voice make these linked stories stand out, yet they pale in comparison to the personal essay Monk published in the New York Times Magazine. I hope we'll see a full-length memoir from her someday."
5,"Splendid Surprise, A Gift From a Friend","I was stunned as I read this new voice, whose stories of Cokesville and its inhabitants thrilled me with laughter, tears and hope for us all. I remember a guy yelping about how Italians weren't anything like the Sopranos on TV. The mope totally missed the poetic journey of Tony and the gang. As the Sopranos is about the great large family under the tragic duress of societies forces, we are all from Cokesville, every one of us, and the life of it is the life of America, perhaps beyond. I am moved by this author's humanity and her powerful way with the page."
4,The Tapestries of Life,"Upon reading this book I realized the complexity and importance of the communication of ones dailiness through all creative medium is the key to understanding the actual lives women live. The lessons I've learned from the women in my life, were subtly learned through observation and stories I've been told. All of the stories that the women in my life have shared with me, have shaped me to see the purpose and importance in being a woman. In the reading so far I have been able to relate to many of the stories the poems represented. The themes of Daily Resistance is Activism, Art Can tell the Truth Like Nothing Else Can and Personal Testimony is Valid are brought into awareness through this book and I highly recommend this book to all people."
2,Wonderful In All Ways But One,"This is my fifth F-Series mousepad. I love the size, surface texture, thinness, even the price is okay. But I have four of the five sitting in a cabinet because the bottom area separated from the top area, and it ALWAYS starts with the corner where the round Orange Ball with an F goes through it. Wait, sorry, my wife said she threw away the box I had with three of them. Only one broken one left. I was hoping someday I could find out where/how to return them. I'll keep buying them though and I suppose that makes me a sucker.. I just love the way they feel and work. I just wish they'd last longer than a few months. My newest one, the one I'm writing this review for? It's about two weeks old and separating already."
1,Bosh 13355 Oxygen sensor,"This bosh 13355 does not fit a Rav4Toyota rav4, The electrical connection has incorrect pins for this car. after installing had to remove and discard item could not return after installing. Most Bosh items are of good quality but this was a loss of $70.00, be sure if you but any part check all connectors before installing and save yourself your money.Some Oxygen sensors only have a very small change and that will not work on your car. Match all parts to see if they match exactly on every pin and Plastic connections.The loss of $ 70.00was not good and use old part to check to see if it matches perfect size or it will not work on your car!"
1,Too Tiny,"I was so excited to buy this for my husband, to replace the one he lost. When it arrived, I discovered that it was WAY too small. It's MAYBE the size of my pinky nail! You can hardly see the words and image on it, unless you tip it to the light just right. I ended up returning it, as there is absolutely no way I would give this to my husband to wear."
4,What I Like About Monica -,"- is, unlike the ex-nuns of the sixties and seventies, she doesn't blame the church for her mistake. Ms. Baldwin readily acknowledges she was given every opportunity to 'test her vocation' and back out before commiting herself but failed to take advantage of them because she wished to avoid onerous responsibilities at home. She never says what Order or Congregation she belonged to but from the description of the habit I'd guess she was a Canoness Regular, probably Augustinian."
4,Train for the tree,I purchased this train for around the tree. It is a good train and I like that the Thomas car is battery powered. I would recommend it. Just be advised that you may need to add more pieces to the track if you have a larger tree.
4,received promptly,Purchased as a gift. No complaints. Delivered promptly. Had it mailed directly to grandson. Easy way to buy and ship.
5,I love Bugs too!,I especially enjoyed this book my mom gave to my son after his baby sister was born this spring... :)
4,I Love Bugs Review,"I am an entomologist and I bought this book for my 2 1/2 year old son because he loves bugs! This book has very colorful pictures and is very cute, yet simple. There really isn't much information except that it offers some basic bug identifications. My son likes it though and so do I."
2,Shrewdly written British publication.,"This is another conspiracy theory book involving Frank, Ava, Marilyn, The Mob, The Kennedy's, and the rest of the Rat Pack. The problem with this book, is the author's assertions that he personally received his information from them. He provides no proof that these conversations actually took place. The reader is to believe the author's words only. To make matters worse, there are incorrect facts, names and dates throughout this book. And sadly, the people involved can not refute what was written."
3,"Interesting story, questionable accuracy","The author presents an interesting premise, but I have to question the accuracy of his facts. There were some very basic errors that would have been caught with even the slightest amount of research. For example:He states that Sinatra's first big band gig was with the Henry James Orchestra. It was in fact, the Harry James Orchestra. I realize that Harry is a nickname for Henry, but no one has ever referred to him as Henry James.He say that Sammy Davis Jr. started his career with his uncle's trio, ""The Will Martin Trio."" It was in fact, the Will Mastin Trio.The author claims the Desert Inn in Las Vegas was run by Cleveland mobster Moe Daltz. His name was actually Moe Dalitz.These were not just typos, but were repeated several times in the book. You have to wonder how much effort he put into checking his facts."
4,One of his bests.,"This has ta be one of ESHAM's best albums, it shows he was putting out great cd's when others, like Snoop or Dre, were just getting into rap! This is one of ESHAM's most evil albums, with tracks like ""666"" and ""hellterskkkellter"". ESHAM has some major talent, even when other rap was just starting to get good. Definetly pick this up, even if it's not as good as all the others it's definite album for the REAL fans of ESHAM."
2,this book ain't got soul,"This was the book I purchased leaving the music store after getting my first bass. I sat at home and learned how to read the notes in the first position, mastered tablature reading and even learned the C Major Scale in the first position. But the only problem was that the book gave zero application possiblities for any of the things I took my time to learn. It was a good thing that I immediately enrolled in private bass lessons or I probably would've gotten frustrated with this four-string beast and quit the instrument. I really don't recommend this book to anyone. It has a few slap lines to learn and could improve your music reading abilities, but other than that it is useless.Check out on of the following...The Evolving Bassist-Rufus ReidThe Jazz Bass Book-John GoldsbyThe berklee bass practice method"
3,It would be better to get the version with a cassette or CD,"In theory, this book also is available for purchase with a cassette or a CD. The paperback book alone really is not very helpful for a bass novice. Being able to hear the music would be more helpful. However, right now, no one seems to have the book for sale with the CD or with the cassette. Good luck!"
2,14K puffed heart charm,"The heart was in excellent condition when it arrived, however, it was way smaller than I wanted. I would have loved it to be larger. It shows on the computer to be larger than it really was."
1,Not what i expected,"I bought this from one of the sellers and it turned out to not be what it was supposed to be (there were 12 tracks of nonsense as opposed to the over 100 tracks of samples that were supposed to be there). However, upon contacting the seller, they had no problem returning my payment. The seller gets 5 stars for their prompt and professional handling of the situation, the disc itself gets a negative 5."
3,"Great sheet, not so good shade of sage.","The sample picture is of a white sheet, the sage color is a shade of green. I ended up returning 2 of the 3 sheets I purchased because when I placed one on the mattress it didn't look like a soft pastel sage, it looked more like electric-green, almost neon bright. Think twice about this color. I have other Carter's sheets in different colors and I love them, they fit perfectly and smooth out once placed on the mattress tightly."
5,awesome,not exactly what i expected but it is still a really nice pendent maybe a veiw of the back of the pendent would be good as well?
4,An Insight into Ingenuity,"Let's see, kickin set list with fan favorites and some beautiful extended jams? check. Wall of sound? check. Interviews with the band and some colorful dead heads? check. Behind the scenes footage? check. The most moving rendition of Morning Dew ever captured on tape? check.The bottom line: You will not be dissapointed, this one has it all!"
4,Christmas gift for my son in law.,My son in law was very pleased with the DVD. He said there were a lot of different things on it.
4,"""And the band plays on""","A very enjoyable and facinating documentation of the feel of the Dead. Certainly shows the Vibe of the band, in their Groove. 'Tis been a long strange trip to the acquisition of the Grateful Dead Movie, and this journey will Morph unto adventures further. Onward, another path is taken to learn the Questions of the obvious to be learned before elevation towards the Next Level. If you Dig!"
1,Don't waste your money outside the US,Beware this is a region locked bluray which is unable to be played outside the US. I own a multi region blu ray player and this is the only bluray I have ever ordered on either Amazon or Amazon UK thjat was labelled Region A or Region B that would not play. Google if you need to - you'll find this described as a $10 coaster!. It gets one point rather than zero because the extra disc is a DVD that will play - a tragedy for Grateful Dead fans
1,don't buy this,"...these guys are from Holland and are not the Shoes from Illinois, those creators of fantastic power pop. However, if you like...60's-70's European pop, go ahead and buy it, just don't expect the jangly hooks and catchy lyrics you anticipated. What a waste of money. I only gave it one star because no stars was not an option."
4,"Not a manual for quick help, but a guide to study!","Dear friends, don't use this book to solve a problem you've NOW. If you never programmed with VFP, this iS NOT the best book to buy. Read it, as a guide to understand what VFP has to give in several aspects, that other books just mentioned. Here, you have complete examples (althouth they should come on a CD-Rom) that can be VERY useful to your application. It has a little of everything, but doesn't focus too much (it's up to you find the rest of the way). But, i think it's a good book."
1,Hard to find stuff.,"This is not a reference book. Topics are very hard to find, and when found, do not cover the subject very well. This book is obviously meant to be read from cover to cover like a novel. You cannot program and flip through the book as a reference. I found myself picking up Miriam Liskin's ""Programming Foxpro 2.0"" from time to time so that I could jog my memory for some of the more basic stuff.I bought this book through Barnes and Noble off the shelf and am returning it tonight... after finding something else here at Amazon."
1,Dissapointing read,"I found the book particularly hard to follow, with a lot of disjointed areas. For example, early in the book, the author talks about the main window, with a command window inside that, further down the same page it refers to the command window as the main window and goes on to describe the objects within that window. However as the author has swopped 'main' and 'command', utter confusion results. I would advise people who need a Foxpro primer not to get this book. There appears to be no succinct overview of the Foxpro package to enable you to hang any threads from. It reads rather like a mystery book, where all is only made clear at the last chapter, unfortunately I never got there due to the number of mistakes and confusion generated before that. This quite expensive book was a total waste of my time and money."
1,No Good is an uderstatement!,"If you are a beginner to VFP6, do not buy this book.. It is a useless book as a reference as well. To be totally honest, this is the worst book I've ever read!"
1,Anything is better than this book.,"This book is so disjointed that it was absolutely useless as a guide to learning FoxPro. Okay, I did learn something but the payoff for the hours wasted reading this book was minimal. Even after mastering some of the concepts the layout made for a horrible reference. Do not buy this book."
3,A helpful book only if you take time to read it,This book attempts to explain Foxpro from the ground-level up. You must read it chapter by chapter and study the example programs (not included with the book). If you have the time and patience then you will definitely master Foxpro.
1,"For me, this book was a bad choice...","I agree with the other reviews. If you are a beginner with Visual FoxPro, stay away from this book. I know nothing about programming VFP, but I've done my share of programming. I've worked with BASIC, COBOL, Pascal, C and assembly. I figured I could transfer my previous programming knowledge to VFP. Not with this book! This book wouldn't even make a good reference. I suppose if you knew how to program in VFP, you might get something out of it."
1,!!! Don't Buy This Book !!!,"This book will not get you up to speed on using VFP 6.0. It skips around and wanders off during it's explanation of things and in the end you get nothing out of the attempted explanations. In addition, it has typos that are not spelling typos, but actual command typos, further confusing you more than you are already due to the way this book is written. I'm calling Amazon to see if I can still return it."
2,Projects were a little too strange.,"I think Ms. Skinner has a lot of talent but I was disappointed in the projects. I wanted some advice to use on different areas of my house but the projects in the book were really unique and not applicable, I believe, to most people. It was not a book I would order again."
3,Nice Keyboard Work,"This band has potential...some interesting moments, good keys. However, the songs don't quite gel for me."
5,Great Product,"Git it very fast thanks. A PuertoRican must for ur car :).. Reppin all day Bayamon, Puerto Rico. 5 Stars Review rating"
3,not what i expected,i thought i was going to hang it in my car on my rear view mirror but it didnt have the right string.. made my own :)
2,Like father like son,"I found the author's lack of insight into his son very troubling. One would think that a true crime writer would have more of a grasp of the human psyche. Like his son the author ran away from problems and saw himself above other people, including his first two wives and his son's wife. How could you not express condolences to the family of a woman who who was part of your family for several years. How could you not protect her, because she was a stripper! I couldn't help but wonder if white privledge wasn't part of the picture but never mentioned."
4,no title,"This book made me actually plan a trip, and reserve a hotel, on Iona, but to my everlasting regret, circumstances caused a cancellation of our plans. But like Wiederkehr's ""A Tree Full of Angels"", there is definitely some over-the-top stuff here, just not Catholic in nature. Very definitely New Age. Howell is a Jungian psychologist, which should tell you much. The lure of this island, though, as Howell describes their stay there, is almost unbearable. Perhaps someday."
5,"Jessica in California Games,in Gymnastics!","Jessica,Lila,Mary are all in Gymnastics to enter in the California Games. Jessica meets Dawn Maven,A Weston Middle School Girl,one day,as Jessica is practicing,she slips up. Dawn puts baby oil on the parallel bars and pretends that her leg is hurt to hide the baby oil. To get even,Jessica puts sugar in the chalk,to make Dawn slip off the parallel bars. She hurts her knee or leg. Jessica feels guilty,that She brings her a basket of stuff. Dawn is angry at Jess. They make up."
3,Go Jess!,"This is a good book in which Jessica learns how to put away rivalry and vicious competition and to work with a difficult girl competitor in order to win a gymnastic competition fairly,and not because that competitor has been injured.Jess shows great maturity and initiative and is a noble role-model in this book."
3,SOME FLAWS,"I think that this was a good book but there were some major, major flaws n it!!!!! I am a retired elite gymnast so I know 4 a fact that Jessica could not have been that good if she had not done gymnastics b-4. There were some other little flaws 2!!!!!!!!"
5,More Than Just a Travelog,"Anna Savage left Ukraine as a little girl during the chaos of World War II and returned as an American journalist shortly after Ukraine became an independent country in 1991 These bookends of her life provide the context for a detailed portrait of life in post-communist Ukraine, historical background necessary to understand that portrait and one family's search for its roots. Ms. Savage is able to combine her journalist's eye for a story with her family's stories about a homeland she scarcely recalls. She is also very honest in depicting the reactions of herself, her mother and her aunt upon return to a homeland that is now less than idyllic."
5,HQ2 don't dissappoint.,"I've owned this import single since 2001, and I have to say it's aged very well. ""He Loves U Not"" is still a great pop song ten years later. While I actually recommend picking up their album ""It Was All A Dream"" if you like that song, this single has a little something different, a remix from HQ2 -- Hex Hector and Mac Quayle! Hex & Mac turn the catchy pop tune into a hot and steamy club anthem. That's really all that needs to be said. It's one of my favorite mixes from the duo, and that's saying something considering the great mixes they've created over the years. Also included on this single is the album version, an additional (inferior) club mix, a UK 2-Step dance mix, and a hip-hop flavored remix, which is the same remix tacked onto the end of the album, except this time with an added rent-a-rapper.Overall I recommend this single!"
2,Not recomended,"The book covers two peoples (the persians and greeks)and a period (almost 200 years) where the changes in warfare, not to say in batlle dress, are very extensive. So it is highly superficial on both.There are much better color plates and information in other Men-at-Arms titles. Look for them, this one is barelly a start.Finally, there is no evidences, as has been written in books of this same series, that Spartans have ever used the composit body armour as showed in the book."
3,Another OK Anime..,"This series is again one of those that just lost me by the time it got to the end. It's not a bad anime, I just found myself losting interest by the end. I stil think it's worth a look.BTW: I've noticed a number of reviewers complaining about not being able to skip thru the Funimation ads that appear right after the FBI warning on the front of the disk. I too find these to take away from watching the DVD. I have found on my player that if you press stop when you see the FBI warning and then press the DVD root menu key, you skip the ad. I'm not sure this will work on all DVD player models but it does on my Philips."
5,Cheap and funny,title says it all. its a pretty cheap dvd set. Funny and well worth the money I spent on it.
3,OK but not great.,I like the book ok but it just wasn't great. I liked Sky Dancer but i found my self not liking Danielle untll she is kidnapped. I also thought that The men were also a bit shallow. I would only recomend this book if you have the other 3.
1,Last one standing? HA! the irony of it all....,i've got three words for ya....Spice Girls wannabes.....i first heard the song in taiwan while i was on vacation there and it's really dumb....they aren't even that good looking either....what's up with the pink hair? or where 4/5 of the girls have an 'a' to end their first names? and they've been disappearing down the top of the pops charts in england faster than you can say 'how ironic'.
4,Improving Nursing Home Care of the Dying: A Trianing Manual for Nursing Home Staff,Best and most clearly written book that covers this subject. We use it inour nursing homes all the time. Really shows our people what they can doto nurture and comfort both the patient/resident and their families.
5,A delicious read from cover to cover.,"Right from the opening credits, you know this is not one of those run of the mill italian cook books that are a dime a dozen on the shelves. Mixed among its drop dead delicious italian recipes is a mixture of intriging mob stories, a cast of characters right out of the dirty 30's and cool cooking tips. It is the first cook book I have actually ever read from cover to cover and while the read is a hoot, the recipes are even better!"
3,Pretty good,"I like to shop around to get the best bang for the buck. this product seems to have done this. Im not a pro at cards and honestly dont even play that much. But i wanted to have a decent sized set of chips and cards and dice, just in case the moment called for them. Everything is pretty decent, the cards are cheap, but the chips are neat looking i like the design and the feel good. The case is just ok, im carful when i carry it because i have notice the latch has opened once or twice. I think it just cant handle the weight, it is pretty heavy. all in all good"
4,Simpsons fan,"I bought this to add Milhouse, Edna, Seymour, and Ralph to my collection of Simpsons bendables. I am happy with the purchase."
4,Grounded adapter for USA to South Africa,They order was handled very efficiently. Unfortunately got sick and had to cancel my trip to Africa.
5,Breathtaking!,"This is an EXCELLENT compilation of information on the philately of Tuva, that mysterious land in the heart of Asia. Some of it is available from no other source.Whether it be stamps, postmarks, covers, bibliographic titles, or what have you, you just never know what you're going to uncover next! This makes browsing this CD a real philatelic adventure, and a pleasure indeed.To top it off, it seems the CD is updated periodically as yet more ultra-rare material crawls out of the woodwork --- or falls out of the stamp album, as the case may be."
2,Not the best toy,"I bought this toy for my older, over weight, food motivated cat. I thought that this toy would be prefect for him (food was involved). He played with it for about 15 mins the first day, and hasn't played with it since (it has been about a month). For the time that he did play with it, it wasn't holding up very well. He ripped up some of the mesh keeping the treats in the toy, and the dangled end pieces. I thought for sure that my other cat would play with this toy, since she plays with any other toy I bring her, but it was no such luck.I should have listened to the other reviews, this toy was not worth the money, especially since neither of my cats will play with it.The ""Premier Twist and Treat, Small"" was a hit with the cat I bought this product for."
1,"Love the concept, not the product","The concept is great but this is not a toy for my cats. The treat pocket is very small, too small for all but the smallest cat treats and then you can only fit two or three. My cats chewed it but did not understand the concept and got bored very quickly."
2,It was great...until I got a Mac,Worked amazingly well when I had a regular desktop PC. However plugging it into my USB ports on my MacBook Pro to it not even detect the reader. :(
5,Works like a charm.,"I got this to use with my digital cameras SD cards. Works great. Easy to use and seems to be fast. Works well with my Mac laptop and desktop, and also with my newer 16 and 32 gb cards too. Just what I wanted."
4,Back up,"I use the memory card in the PC slot, this is as a back up for other PC that don't have and SD slot. It would be better if the key chain hole is part of the USB part, not the lid, it becomes useless"
4,SDHC cards are not SD cards,"I found out that my SD card reader won't read SDHC cards, so I needed a new one. The SanDisk product was less than $10 and works fine w/o any trouble. When I first installed it, the WIN7 machine I used it on loaded a new driver which took a while. Now it works just like any other SD card reader -- except it works with SDHC cards."
4,Does what it was made to do,"I bought this to replace another card reader that mysteriously vanished. I was expecting a white one, but I received one in black instead, though it's not a big deal. So far it's been working fine. It's a bit slower than my other SD card reader, which was the same price, which is why I rated it 4 stars. I also rated it this because of the design. I wish there was some type of cover for the place where the card is inserted. I'm just worried about dust or junk getting into the slot when I put my card reader into my bag & in general. Overall I feel good in my choice to buy this product & hoping that it won't die on me. For anyone that is curious, I use this product with my 2008 Macbook. I read some other reviews about having to insert the card first before putting the card reader in, so that is what I do."
4,Great alternative to the USB cord,"The USB cord for my camera stopped functioning, so I pulled out a SD card reader that had come packaged with a memory card I had purchased. Unfortunately, that reader did not work, so I came to Amazon and found the Sandisk MicroMate Reader.Pros:Works great. Pop the disk in, plug in to your computer and you're uploading your images.Preferences:Would be nice if the plastic cap was attached to the unit. Also, I would like a reader that the card inserts into completely, as I keep my spare SD card in the reader now, but I worry about breaking it as it is not flush with the unit (a reader that uses the same mechanism for the card inside the camera would be nice).The things I would prefer, are not deal breakers. This is a nice little reader and is working simply and without fail."
5,This works on my MacBook Air,"I had two other SD readers (very cheap ones) that I couldn't get to work on my new Mac Book Air 11 inch, which does not have a SD card slot. So it was important that I got one that did work. Eventually a ""genius"" at the Mac store was was to get one of my cheap ones to work so I could load pictures, but I knew I needed a better one. This does the job perfectly and the cap stores on the device while you are using it."
4,I Recommend It,This little guy works like a charm. I have no complaints. It meets all of my file transfer speed expectations. It's compact and durable. What's not to like?My setup: I use this SanDisk MicroMate SDHC with my Transcend 4 GB SDHC memory card and Summer 2007 MacBook Pro to transfer both photos from my digital camera and large files from other computers.
3,Works but...,"This is a good piece to have for old computers, as many now include SDHC readers, but this particular item it has some flaws, as the male usb port is in the middle, so it blocks other usb ports in your computer, as they are always very close...."
1,DOES NOT WORK,The enclosure feels like cheap plastic and could fall apart in any second. Plug in a SD card and connect the reader to a USB port on a Mac. Nothing happens !
1,SanDisk MicroMate,I have a Dell with front USB ports that are recessed. I can't plug it in all the way. Need to unplug a port in the back and the micromate covers up the port below it. Wish I would have know this before I bought the device.
1,Micormate driver,"until i can figure out how to get the micromate usb reader to work on windows XP, it gets 1 star. It's supposed to be plug and play. Grrrr"
1,Poor quality product with dreadful reliability!,"i ordered this product and rechargeable batteries and charger. Both are junk. The ""Reader"" failed after the first use, and the batteries never hold an adequate charge. I later purchased a Rayovac Battery charger w/ batteries from Walmart ($6.00)...works great! As for the Reader, I simply download from the camera to desktop! Save your money!"
1,Stop working and not supported in Windows Vista,"Stop working and not supported in Windows Vista, and there is no any support material at the web site."
4,Useful DSLR accessory,"Since the manual with my Canon T3i explained that using a cable to download photographs would use battery power in the camera, this seemed like a reasonable purchase. It's faster than the cable route, compact enough to drop in any pocket in my camera bag and does what it's advertised to do: make downloads quick and easy. Delivery was very timely and the product arrived in good condition. It also seemed reasonably priced."
5,Pretty Cool,"It's pretty cool. Plug it in your computer, it installs some software for a couple seconds, and that plastic part that covers the usb can be put on the bottom part of the device, which covers the SDHC card too. I like it."
3,Average product for the price,This is an average memory card reader. The low price is appealing. You will need a USB extension for most PC's. The square shape didn't work well with by Dell front case.
1,It didn't work.,"I had to return it. It's Sandisk, so I probably just got a bad one, but it's extremely frustrating considering I need it."
5,Great price & product,I use this memory card USB port for memory cards of different brands and formatting. The best part of this product is the size and portability of the reader. I use it primarily for uploading pictures from memory cards used in various cameras - I keep it in the camera bag. It works great.
4,wrong color,item functionality - 4 starsservce/item advertised vs what was received - 1 stari ordered this thinking i was ordering a white one... a black reader arrived. didn't want to deal with the hassle of a color change. works well though!
5,Worked Perfectly,"A friend sent me a disk from her camera with photos of our trip to China. My computer doesn't have a card reader, so I ordered this one. I plugged it in and in 30 seconds was downloading the photos."
5,WONDERFUL AND EXCELLENT !!!,"Wonderful short film and excellent production. SOLO is a remarkable documentary about climbing, showing something to reach. One, is touched and moved by this climber who shows us that things in our life are not so easy but at the end, the reward is great. We are not alone and sometimes we need the help of someone, found in our way, to be motivated in reaching our goals.The first time I watched this film was in 1976 when I was a highschool student and some years later in 1985 I got a copy in tape (Beta format).I was looking for this film in DVD since several years ago and now, it is a great surprise to have this release. I recommend this documentary not only for someone interested in climbing but also for teachers, students, and general public as an element of motivation in order to have the courage for solving all the troubles we find in our daily life. Don't miss it !!"
1,OLD product -- battery bad on reciept,"on recievin this, charged it per instructions -- went to use it 2 weeks later battery low -- recharged it agin -- NO GO!looks like I've gotten a booster that is out of date -- been sittin too long before sale I'm guessin -- I'm NOT happy!"
3,Pricey - but what the kid wanted!,"My nephew had been asking for Snow-Covered Thomas for months.... so obviously I wanted to be the cool aunt and get it for him! The packaging and everything was in good condition, however I was just amazed at how expensive these small wooden toys were. Seems pretty steep for how little they are.... nephew is happy though!"
5,Great!,"These trains are fun for any train lover. My son loved playing with the painted one at the book store, so he was really excited to have his own set."
3,Not pleased with quantity,The add said 3 pack. I bought size 44 which were 80 cents cheaper but still said 3 pack. It was a 2 pack. that made the price higher than if I bought them from Sears who does not charge a premium for the larger sizes.
3,Weak waist elastic,"Had to get one size smaller to get elastic to be snug enough to hold these up! Had to do an exchange from actualsize, going back to Jockey, is this enough words, Amazon?"
1,very bad fit,"pouch opening three inch on one side two and half on the other side from top band and leg opening big enough for a 500 lb person, realy bad baggy fit. Who ever designed this should be fired. worst fit ever. cheap price if you can wear them????? the picture's look a hole lot better then they fit believe me.Munsingwear Men's Full-Rise Comfort Pouch Brief"
4,Husband's undies,"This style has been my husband's favorite for over 30 years, and it's delightful to simply go to Amazon and order a new supply as needed. Fast and easy!"
1,NO Support,"I bought the Pro III, two years ago. It worked well, till the teflon tape covering the sealing heat bar tore. I called foodsaver at the customer service number, and they informed me I could not buy the tape, nor would they repair the unit. I was told they would give me a $20.00 trade-in allowance, on a new unit for only 259.95. What a Deal!! They do not repair any items. If the unit is less than one year old, they replace it...more than one year old, its junk. Tells you alot about a company, that will not repair their own top-of -the -line model. Never will I purchase an other foodsaver or anything else from the Tila company. I now have a very expensive door stop!"
1,Beware or We got a Lemon!,"Our FoodSaver Pro III Series worked great for ONE year and ONE month! Loved it's performance, however, we are not impressed regarding its durability after paying about $190 with only a year warranty....After using it sparingly 2-3 times per month, we just tried to seal and vacuum a few items today and a huge electrical spark came out of the left side of the unit, and it was dead--and in the garbage. Talk about planned obsolescence!!!!Cannot afford to buy a new one every year! Would NOT buy another one!"
1,I would give this a zero if possible,"When our old foodsaver died, we decided to go with the professional series since we buy meat in bulk and vacuum pack it. This lasted about a year when the lower gasket started falling apart and the sealer stopped working. When my husband called for a replacement foam gasket from the only company that sells parts for these machines, and he was specific about which one (the bottom gasket), they sent us the gasket for the top. When we called ""the only parts company that carries foodsaver parts"", they said they don't make gaskets for the bottom portion only the top. So, in short, if you want an expensive sealer that they don't even carry parts for, go ahead and buy this. Otherwise, go with a less expensive one that can be thrown out or go with another brand altogether."
5,Happy New Owner,"This is my first Foodsaver product and I purchased it because of other reviews I had read about Foodsaver's customer service and product quality. I have been very impressed with the Foodsaver Professional III so far. It is SO Easy to use! I like all the simple features (removable ""spill"" tray, one button operation, ""internally"" stored power cord, etc.) and there are no little-used features that just get in the way. You simply place your item(s) in the bag, put the open end in the slot, and push a button! When the sealing is complete (about 10 seconds), the lid lock releases and you're done. The heavy duty seal makes it immediately available for the next thing to seal."
1,Used to be an excellent product,"When our old Foodsaver, which was made by Tilia, finally died we decided to upgrade. This ""professional"" model worked for less than 4 months when it gave up the ghost. The company will only ""repair"" it--no replacement.And, that's at my expense to ship this lemon back to them.Foodsaver is no longer the quality product it used to be, nor do you get the same level of customer service as before."
1,Cheap piece of plastic - broke in less than one minute,I ordered two of these and they arrived today. I literally pulled them out of the bag to show a co-worker and pulled on the retracting tab twice before it completely fell apart. Piece of junk.
4,Does the job.,Needed a new one of these for my badge at work. It is still going strong after a couple years of use.
3,It is what it says it is,"This came as promised, packed ok, on time. It is what I expected. The reason this rating is only average is that the item cost was more than twice what I paid when I bought them locally and I ordered several, they did consolidate the packing, but not the shipping charge so I paid WAY too much for shipping. Since these are cheaply made they break readily and need to be replaced, so the total cost per item due to this means that - while I will purchase this item again - I will be looking for a less expensive source."
2,Not her best record,"""Two Much"", her first record with Stan Kenton and his Big Band, is a much better piece of work. This record, her first release on Atco, is with a small combo. Barney Kessel's guitar work is excellent. Jack Sheldon's trumpet is very good, too. Red Callender's bass is solid. Ann shows off the ""sexier"" side of her voice, and a couple of the songs are very suggestive for 1960. The liner notes, referencing Ann's ill-advised appearance in Playboy magazine, is an indication of what they were trying to sell. They even give her weight and height in the liner notes. The tunes are largely standards. Her performance is competent but not spectacular. The recording is very left-right in almost an annoying way. Tons of reverb on her voice for most of the cuts. A nice curiousity, but far from the really exciting effort of ""Two Much"". Wouldn't buy it again."
5,Great Pen/Pencil Set,I have always trusted WATERMAN. I use them as graduation gifts all the time. Great reliable long lasting items
3,Cisco First Year Companion Guide Revised Edition,The book is supposed to be a companion guide to the Networking Academy Curriculum but you have to follow along with a chart to figure out which chapters in the book go with which chapters in the curriculum. The book needs re-organization.
2,Companion is exactly was this book is... that's it!!!,"This book was not what I expected from a Cicso Press book. For one thing... the gloassary in the back of the book is missing too many definitions to be anything effective. Cisco also decided not to include any of its graphics that you find in their accedemy web-site into the book. Also, the chapters in the book do not corespond with the chapters on-line, which made it confusing for me when it came time to take the chapter 2 quiz. I've only used this book maybe twice through-out the semester. You don't even need this book!!!"
1,Incomplete,"This book is shamefully incomplete. As a CNAP student, I expected this book to augment my learning experience by offering further, deeper reading on program objectives. Unfortunately, it is, at best, simply a passable reference for completing the Engineering Journal pages when away from the computer. However, even in this it falls short. Perhaps the first improvement to the second edition should be including the full glossary from the on-line curriculum."
2,sloppy,"In this book we learn:""the signals from computers to monitors, printers, and other peripherals are baseband because they are analog modem communications."" (p. 137. This sentence is surreal. The writer was either asleep or shouldn't be let near a typewriter. Even Cisco Press should know a computer doesn't use a modem to reach its monitor or other local peripherals. Baseband just means single-frequency.)""The speed of light is 3.0 x 108 (sic) m/s; networking signals travel at 1.9 x 108 (sic) to 2.4 x 108 (sic) m/s."" (p. 147. In other words, a little slower than the speed of sound. Bad copyediting, bad typesetting, bad proofreading.)No thanks, Cisco. What I study, I want to be true."
3,Cisco Networking,"If you are buying this book to help you in your networking class, this book is very brief. The curriculum that is online is a lot better. But if you but the second edition of this book, it is identical to the online curriculum. I would recommend that you order the second edition instead of this book. This book has some of the information, but it does not go into any detail. For the same price you can a book that will really help you alot."
1,Just Remember!,"This book is OK but remember if you are taking the Cisco course with the workbook this is Cisco's Ver. 1.1.1.1 and it may not match any of the online chapters. It's ok for some reference but it has a great deal of errors in the Hex and Subnet Masking areas, which can drive you insane if you have no other reference, if I had it to do over I would wait for a revision or find another text. I will try and post the page numbers with the mistakes at a later time.ZeroCQQL"
3,look for a better book; Cs. didn't even name the authors.,"after using this book in the netacademy, it was helpful but I don't look back at it with a good memory. I remember it's faults - the glossary that left terms out. Cisco should have editted the text and cirrculum better before sending it. There are graphics that don't make a point - they sometimes don't put together the same information the text gives. First Yr Guide 2nd edition, pg 180 for instance, fig. 5-19 says to use a straight through cable when both ports are designated with 'x' but the correct caption should say ""crossover cable"". This is just after the text defining the pinout of the 2 RJ-45 connectors in a crossover cable are different from each other. Lots of other errors and shortfalls make this frustrating and disappointing.By comparison Wendell Odom is a better writer and his Cisco books are a joy. Maybe the 2004 netacad books are better too."
3,Cisco First Year Companion Guide - Revised Printing,This book was published in May-2000 and has 500+ pages compared to the Cisco Networking Academy's latest May-2001 book recommended by Cisco which was pubished and has 900+pages. Topics like subnetting are not covered in depth in this book. Overall OK but for more value for the money I would recommed Cisco Networking Academy with ISBN: 1587130254
5,"cheap, works great, you cannot go wrong.",bought this product for my surveillance system and it worked great. Did its job. feels durable and arrived quickly. bnc and rca connectors feel firm and stay in place
2,Bad video quality,"If the standard cable that came with my equipment is a 10, this ones shows a picture that I would rate 5 due to lower resolution, darker images. I conclude this cable is made with inferior materials."
4,Pizzicato 5 sing song happy Japanese melody special,"You probably should avoid this if you don't have a sense of humour. The combination of cheesy 50s pop sounds with sudden attacks of 90s techno-style becomes alarming at times, but it rapidly seeps into your consciousness. The eccentric inlay notes merely add to the joy of the experience."
3,Chocolate Cow,"This video was so funny and yet so sad at the same time. It is very common for bands to dub in crowd noise to make the show sound better than it really was. Kiss was best known for this on Kiss Alive and Kiss Alive II. But it doesn't really work on a DVD because you can see the crowd.How does a crowd that is 90% men sound like a bunch of girls in between songs? LOL. You can see the crowd just standing around waiting for the next song, but when you hear it, you would swear the Beatles just hit the stage. TOO FUNNY.Look Manson, if you are going to steal some crowd noise to dub in, get it from a Maiden show or Slayer show where it's mostly men. Don't be dubbing in Cheap Trick Live at Budakon.So said and yet so funny."
4,5-stars only if you love the music,I expected a little more. But still amazing quality of capture. I did not notice any lip-syncing that others have mentioned and I watch this pretty closely.
3,great song,"but there is only one song on this CD. thats why there are no reviews. and thats why I put one, so people will know that there is only one song with 2 tracks. too bad she ended her life, great singer"
4,HDMI not suitable for Motorola DVR's,"HDMI cables do not work well with Motorola DVR's. They are slow showing the picture when switched on and do not forward the Close Captioned (CC) signal to the TV. That's why the cable company (Time Warner) suggested the use of a component (3-prong) video cable combined with a two prong audio cable, a solution that--according to tests with other equipment--provides equally good quality as an HDMI cable."
2,Dont bother,I used these cables between an HDTV and a cable box. The difference between these and the standard cables provided by the cable company (3 plug video and 2 plug audio) is minimal at best. The only advantage to the HDMI cables is one cable only. If you are buying them to improve picture/audio quality...DONT WASTE YOUR $. I tend to think the hype re HDMI CABLES in general is much to do about notrhing.
5,Great cable at a discounted price.,Cable works great. Cable is firm so you need a little extra space behind your components.
5,healing prayers,"As a parish nurse i make a lot of home and hospital visits. This book has contained appropriate Psalms for all the needs I have encountered with prayers that have brought myself and those I visit much comfort. A great tool to have in situations where words are hard to find. Compact format, easy to read font and very 'purse worthy'"
5,Hay que leerla dos veces para apreciarla,"De primera intención la obra es pesada, como que cuesta digerirla pero con el paso de las páginas, la misma carga de detalles va haciendo la trama más y más interesante y le da verosimilitud. Es de las pocas obras sobre la Guerra Mundial que tratan personajes nazis sin prejuicios, con sus defectos y virtudes (por ejemplo dice que Eichmann era un genio organizativo y tremendo jugador de ajedrez). El autor demuestra inspirada capacidad narrativa, en hora buena!"
3,"This is the book without the CD, unfortunately",The book is great but I realized that I'm going to have to pay another $20 for the CD! Go directly to the publisher if you want the book and CD for $40.00. I'm a teacher on a tight budget and I'm disappointed~
5,helped me understand the truth of going home,"In a moment of pain...I picked up the book for the second time and began reading it again..I was at a point in my life that I was ready to go home. Then as the book unfolded I understood the importance of the lessons that we learn and of the life that we live. This parable takes us home in our hearts and in our souls. It also shows us the true importance of love in our lives, for others and for ourselves."
4,Proud angels?,"Pride is a human quality, it is the feeding of the ego through projecting onto your 'protected' what you desire for yourself. Giving feelings to angels is a projection, it is an egocentric view of the creation.I wish Lee Caroll had spent more time working on this aspect of the story, because I found it an obstacle against really appreciating the book.I also found the lower self metaphor a bit too naive; evil against good is an overused cliche' and ought to be removed from the new age paradigm once and for all. It is time to accept that evil is part of being human, and that it is the dark side all incarnated souls must plunge into in order to bring light to it.Nonetheless, the story contains beautiful teachings, and if you keep in mind that the book was written by a very human being, along with what I would call his 'package of humanness', you will find insights on how to live your life in a more fulfilling way."
4,An Inspirational Tale,"This fantasy novel is an easy read, but not really exciting or compelling. Written at about a 6th grade reading level, the story is somewhat simplistic, and the character development is really weak.The strength of the novel is it's inspirational value. This is pretty typical of the Kryon material in general, which excels at inspiration, but is not exactly the rocket science of the new age.The ending of this book is great, despite the fact that it ended exactly the way I expected it to.Entertainment: 3 starsEnlightenment: 5 starsOverall: 3.5 stars"
5,One of the best spiritual books!,"This parable, as all Kryon parables, is a RARE GEM OF ENLIGHTENMENT. I couldn't put it down, but most of all: it filled my soul with wisdom and the 'remembrance' of my true Self. It re-ordered aspects of my spiritual existence, clarifying the true purpose of life as the 'Journey Home""..."
5,I love this CD,"Who can remember the 1970s without thinking about the Captain & Tennille? In 1975 they released their debut album, Love Will Keep Us Together, and in 1976 they launched their short-lived (but excellent) variety show. They had met in 1971, when he was performing with the Beach Boys, were married in 1975, and are still together all of these years later - love did indeed keep them together. (I love a love story!)This album was originally released in 1977, and was re-released on CD in 1990. It contains twelve tracks, all of which show off Toni Tennille's wonderful voice, and Daryl ""Captain"" Dragon's mastery of the keyboard. All of my favorites are here, and the quality of the recordings is excellent. I love this CD, and highly recommend it to everyone who likes good music."
3,Cook it Quick,Great quick ideas... with very low points. The food is good and easy to follow receipes
5,Speedy and scrumptious,A selection of speedy and scrumptious meals that only cost low Weight Watchers points. Includes a bonus section of 15-minute recipes.
2,Ok,"I have bought several WW recipe books only to be disappointed from them all. They have recipes with ingredients such as goat cheese or something I or my family wouln't ordinarally eat or even try. Yes there were maybe two recipes that we may try, but save your money."
1,Unrealistic Recipes,"We didn't find a single recipe that we would make a second time. We have since moved to a more realistic eating lifestyle of monitoring our sugar, fat, sodium, and calories as well as making sure we get the proper vitamins and minerals in our daily intake. I found myself dwelling on points all day long which meant I was thinking of food all day long."
2,I found book incomplete.,It has a bunch of recipes but what it doesn't spell out are the portion sizes. None of the recipes in the book have it. I don't know how this one made it past the Weight Watchers editors but it doesn't help me when it doesn't bother telling me what determines a portion.
3,So so plus hard to read index,"The recipes in this are ok--at least the ones I have tried--although there seem to be some repeats or VERY similar recipes in other WW cookbooks. My biggest problem with this book, however, is that the idex is organized in a way that is not user-friendly--it forces you to read every entry to find what you are looking for. You can look inside this book--check out the index first and see if it will work for you. I've found that it's pretty unusable if I'm quickly looking for a specific kind of dish."
3,recipe book,I did not find many recipes I would like to try. That is why I like to look at the recipe books before I buy them. I am on Weight Watchers so I like the idea of having a recipe all laid out with the points already figured. I may use it some.
3,Several great recipes!,"I have found several great recipes in the cookbook; since our family lives in Puerto Rico some products are not available here. On the whole I do recommend this book, the recipes are satisfying and delicious."
5,Nice Tape for Cousteau an Manatee lovers,"Having dove in Crystal Springs Fla many times, I had to have this tape!"
5,Detailed and Clear,"This solution manual accompanying Dr. Spivak's Calculus is worth keeping as a reference. This is one of the few solutions manuals to calculus text that contain relatively detailed explanations and ""demonstrations"". It shows how the math really works!"
4,A rather nice guide to Spivak's Calculus,"This is the answer book that accompanies Michael Spivak's wonderful Calculus book. For the most part, the answer book is accurate but there are a few mistakes. The main complaint is, of course, completeness. Many proofs are merely ""glossed"" through and intermediate steps that may take a page or two to prove are stated as trivial facts. For many of the problems, this book serves as a ""hint book"" rather than an ""answer book."" However, one should be happy at this since the best part of doing a proof is proving it by yourself and writing with triumphantness, ""QED!"""
2,"Terrible solutions, but good start","The solutions in this book are dubious, often lacking in mathematical vigor. They do occasionally provide the reader with a good idea of where to start his proof."
1,Disappointing,The title of this video is misleading. This is not a video about the Sami people or their culture. It is a travel video of the towns and attractions in the Lapland area of northern Finland. Very misleading.
3,Not that great,"This product does not dissolve well in water. Even after vigorous stirring, there are still powder chunks. The flavors are OK, but do not have a rich chocolatey taste like I expected."
1,leather and bananas,"Retro-cheese from video metal's glory years, this is one collection of hearty Havarti sure to get anyone over 30 banging their heads against their Better Parenting manuals. Former fans can rock, rock, rock `til they have to pick the kids up - it's slice after token slice of bush party rock from the `70s (Alice Cooper, Nazareth) and pouty pounding popesque riff-fests from the `80s (Twisted Sister, The Cult, Quiet Riot, Judas Priest, Scorpions, Helix) rerisen from the grave to blow the mould out of their empty heads. It's the story of mayhem, blood, sweat and bulging leather codpieces. Nothing but the codpieces and the bananas are real, of course."
1,"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid.","I'll never buy this product until the DRM is removed. I've been hyping up this game for months at work, but now I'll urge potential buyers to walk away until something is done about this. Absolutely unacceptable."
1,"Great Hype, crappy game","What can I say that hasn't already been said. Each stage isn't a full game by itself, and too many decisions were made to make the game ""easy"" to play.And don't get me started about the DRM. Sorry EA, Battlefield 2 was your last good game, and I shall never buy from you again."
1,"I wish I could buy this game, but because of activation I cannot","I was eagerly awaiting a purchase of this game and have been looking forward to its release for a while now. However, It has come to my attention of the SecuROM DRM protection and this has caused a ""dealbreaker"" for me.I cannot fundamentally, principally or ethically spend any money on such a product. The way I see it... Each dollar in our economy represents a 'vote', ethically I cannot 'vote' for such a product and limitation of it's use. I would love to buy a license for fair use of this product but unfortunately I cannot until this protection is removed.I will await its removal prior to purchase.-- A concerned consumer."
1,Limit the Number of Installs = More Hassle for the Customer,"I had pre-ordered Spore, but canceled it when I heard about the SecuRom DRM on the game. The three game activation limit seems more aimed at killing the used game market rather then preventing piracy. Luckily, there are several other new games on the market now and I'm not too broken up about it.Here's hoping that EA realizes the problem and changes the DRM setup so that it doesn't limit activations."
1,Won't Run on Vista,"I have a Dell Laptop running Windows Vista. The game installed successfully but refused to start. After hours on the phone with tech support, they tell me I'll have to wipe my hard-drive and reinstall windows. The problem is I have more than $10,000 of job-important software installed on my laptop. Programs like Siemens Step 7 and WinCC and Scout take about 3 hours each to install by themselves. I don't want to spend the next 2 weeks reinstalling software just to play this game.They say the DRM built into Spore is getting confused by some piece of software on my laptop but they can't figure out which, so it refuses to let the game start. What a waste of money! Stay away from this game!"
1,DRM makes it a no-go,"After reading about it here, and comparing to the similar DRM scheme used by Bioshock (which in the end caused me so much trouble that I didn't finish it), I think I'll pass on this one.DRM tends to muck up the computer too much and also work badly with software such as AnyDVD which I use to avoid the ""you wouldn't steal a car"" kind of MPAA DRM stuff on the DVD's I buy.If this keeps up, the pirates will have won, because there is no point in paying for being called a thief and having to employ various workarounds to play your legitimate copy of the game.And trust me, I've tried ... one of the Medal of Honor games would crash (!!) the DVD reader, making it impossible to play. When contacting EA Games I was called a thief and in the end they didn't even bother responding to my emails. So I was forced to crack my legal copy in order to play. How messed up is that?"
1,DRM = Minus four customers,"I came here planning to buy two copies (one for my girlfriend's birthday soon) of this game that I have been waiting for for months, and probably would have paid almost anything for them.I then saw that EA apparently has decided that I am a felon for no good reason, turned right around, and left. I don't shop at stores that ask me to show them my bag when I walk out, and I won't shop with EA. I have since convinced two of my friends who are less knowledgeable about DRM not to buy the game.Grow a pair, EA. Respect me as a law abiding customer, and you will receive respect in return, in the form of four customers you now no longer have."
1,A decent concept ruined by DRM,"Will Wright is a god among game developers, but his overlords at EA have ruined what could have been a great game. They've embedded unacceptable DRM into this title--DON'T BUY IT."
1,"Game Fun, DRM BAAAD","I must have been living under a rock, as I had not heard word of the DRM issues before purchasing this game. And I was shocked, and am not surprised at all about the backlash here and other places regarding the crazy DRM scheme.I am all for protecting content but not at the expense of the paying customers like this. I like many here tend to format and re-install everything at least once a year to keep my computer fast and fresh. Now I have to think about Spore when I do that. Thanks but no thanks EA if I could return the game I would.The game it self is fun, top notch game and if not for the DRM would totally be a 5+ star. But like all the others the DRM is too much for this customer."
1,WHY? DRM? WHY?,"Software makers, Music publishers, Movie Producers - GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADDRM does not work and only hurts the honest consumer. Most people who are going to steal this game were not going to buy it in the first place. DRM does not make a thief honest!Please remove the DRM!"
1,"Nice Job EA, do some more damage to your already poor reputation.","Dear EA,Thank you for encouraging piracy by way of your DRM policies. Further more, thank you for killing the sales potential of what is a fantastic game. Whatever you do, don't stop crapping on your customers. You can obviously see just how much we love to be duped out of our hard earned money to pay for a game that is laden with rootkit style DRM and damage to our computers and it's administrative rights.While you're at it, why not require everyone who purchases a game from EA to fork over their drivers license numbers, SSN, finger prints, blood sample, and direct access to our bank accounts? Oh yeah, let's not forget to turn over our first born children with purchase."
1,"Fun, but DRM makes this a NFW",Spent some time playing this at a friends house last night. Idiotic DRM makes this a purchase Ill never make. EA DRM=something to drive away more customers than pirates.
1,DRM = No Purchase!,"The atrocious DRM provided with this version of Spore results in my not purchasing over-the-counter.Nonetheless, I have played the game, and it's not all that - definitely not worth jumping through hoops repeatedly for the sake of some silly DRM..."
1,"Don't buy this, DRM treats you like a criminal","It HAD the potential of being the best selling game of all time, but the folks over at EA destroyed any chance of that happening.The DRM in this is an insult to us. EA treats it's costumers as if they were all criminals."
1,Returning my (unopened) copy due to DRM,"First time reviewer at Amazon even though I've purchased hundreds of products via Amazon.While checking on the shipping status of my pre-ordered copy I decided to check out the reviews for Spore. Completely unknown to me since it's not on the packaging or Amazom review (or any other review I've read), Spore uses SecuROM DRM which limits the number of times I can use the game. Upgrade a PC or change a major component and you'll have to reactivate the game... and you only get three times. Worse yet, SecuROM DRM installs an application on your PC that can not be removed short of reformatting your hard drive.Due to this, I'll be returning my copy before I even open the Amazon box. Kudo's to Amazon for having such a great return policy. And kudo's to the Amazon reviewers for informing me that Spore had draconian SecuROM DRM before I opened the box!"
1,"designed for consoles, not PC's","I play games on my computer because I appreciate the sophistication of games designed to work with a keyboard and utilize my cutting edge CPU & video card. For years, this environment has given me the richest gaming experience available. on any platform. Graphic hardware on consoles only improves on a 5 to 7 year schedule. PC games are always designed for the next generation of hardware.Spore is a new breed of video game that is designed primarily for consoles. Its graphics are old news for people running modern computer hardware. The interface is dumbed down for console controls.No thanks. I'll stick with games designed for the hardware I'm running them on."
1,"Oh C,mon EA. 3 times and you're out?","Friend of mine from work told me about this game so I decided to look into it and was almost getting ready to order when I saw the star rating. After reading the reviews, thank heaven that the DRM issue was mentioned. I'm an avid Sims player & I love the way I can play the game differently each time. But I have to delete & reinstall each time I want to variate the game. But I only get 3 shots with Spore and then I'm outta luck. After paying fifty bucks for it??? I'm telling my friend tomorrow about this game being DRM'd. He hasn't a clue about the nightmare DRM can cause. I went through it with Sony and NEVER AGAIN!!!!Thanks to all the reviewers for keeping consumers informed. Shame on you EA. Whatever happened to keeping the customer happy? Oh, I forgot, corporate greed!!!"
1,Better off pirating.,"The DRM for this game is so ridiculous, and outrageous, that you'd be better off pirating it. At least in that case you wouldn't have to deal with Securom spyware infections on your computer."
1,DRM NO,Plain and simple. I will not buy this game as long as the DRM is part of the deal. I am not a criminal. I will not be treated like one to play a game.
1,So sad about the DRM,"I waited for this game for so long, I thought it might be an actual WoW killer and that I'd start spending so much time playing it, I'd cancel my WoW account. Now with the DRM from hell, there's not a chance I'll be buying it until they remove it.Hell, the real value to the publisher isn't in the initial game packaging, it's in the subscription. If EA had any brains, they'd realize that. I guess Blizz is the only real game company that understands that enough to not screw the people paying them..."
1,"DRM? Please, not again","I have debated all evening whether to take the plunge and install Spore, because I've waited a few years for it. But I am unwilling to install a rootkit on my computer to let some company spy on me or monitor my activities. Enough is enough. I hope that EA takes a major financial hit for this. I am livid."
1,"SecurROM secretly installed, never removed.","Alot of the other reviewers have mentioned the DRM in Spore. They talk mostly about the problem they have with the number of installs allowed and having to call up EA (at your expense) and try to wrangle a new install if you go past your allotment. I hate this as well.But my problem goes back to Sims 2 and when EA started including SecuROM with the expansion packs. Secretly installed on your computer with no documentation, it rendered many peoples drives useless, and even after they provided an ""uninstaller"" remnants will remain.There's no way I would recommend any product from EA that included SecuROM."
2,CAUTION: BEWARE OF USED COPIES,"Being that the product can only be installed 3 times, there is a potential problem with used copies. Be careful when buying used, as you may end up with a disk that you can't do anything with."
1,Malware Alert,"Beware! This product comes with rootkit software that you can not remove, and the game will not run without this malware. Thumbs down to EA for the poor quality assurance. What's that? They *knew* this rootkit was present? They *added* this rootkit? Wow, epic fail for EA! I was really looking forward to buying this game. I guess I'll have to search around for a non-crippled version."
1,Spore,The game itself is 3-5 hours of game play and then it's just a big sandbox to play in.Maybe it's a good thing I'm only allowed to activate it 3 times.
1,"Not fun, didn't even know about DRM when purchasing this game.","I really thought it will be fun and creative game, but oh man was i disappointed.It almost looks like an unfinished product. Don't buy it, seriously.When buying it i wasn't aware of DRM protection at that time. Now it's too late and i can't return it back.So make sure that you really want it."
1,DRM KILLED THIS GAME,"This whole drm issue reminds me when I was a computer tech going out to people's houses to fix their computers (usually spyware/virus issues). I inspected a computer of a honest hard working guy, living in a not so great part of town who just got off work and couldnt play an expansion of the sims he loves so much. I checked all the windows stuff, no problem there I check the game disc and everything else I could think of, I googled the problem and lo and behold TONS of people had this secure-rom problem. I had to tell the guy who knows little about computers I couldnt get the secure rom off (which I used tools for but still wouldnt load the game) and that a format MIGHT do it. I still think about his dissapointment, he bought the sims 2 and 3 or 4 expansions with not a lot of disposable income. Thanks EA, I can download any of your games any time and I dont care, this guy bought everything legit and you screwed him. ^Clap ^Clap ^Clap"
1,"Not me, not now. That's what smart kids say to DRM","I came here excited to buy this game, but after seeing how this is just a rental, I think I will spend the money on some other game. Too bad, it looked like it could be a lot of fun."
1,I was about to buy it . . .,"I was about to buy this game when I saw all of these negative reviews. ALL OF THESE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. I repeat. I thought there must be something wrong. So I checked it out. VERY glad I did. I don't want to pay to rent this game either. 3 activations is ridiculous. This was a major let down for me. I was so excited to get this game and start playing it, but all this anti-piracy stuff is just a major turn-off. And so, now I am sporeless. Maybe I will spend the money I am not spending on SPORE for the survival edition of Fallout 3."
1,Terrible disappointment.,"Like so many others, I tracked Spore's development for years and jumped at the opportunity to purchase it. What I received was a DRM-crippled, dumbed-down product which fails to deliver on its promising premise. So much has already been written, so I'll just mention that the fact that the stats in the Creature Creator are calculated completely differently from the stats in Spore itself is a terrible let-down. It removes a great layer of potential strategy from the game and pigeon-holes creatures into predictable skill-sets."
1,Fantastic game plagued with... DRM.,"Spore is probably the best sandbox game around, make over a trillion different creatures. The possibilities are endless.But I have to say the securom and DRM just made me return the game, I am a computer builder and I am always re-formating and adding new parts to my computer. So I just don't think its worth it, its just an expensive rental."
1,Do not buy this game,"This product sets a dangerous precedent for broken, unusable software. Installing DRM protection makes this game a rental, not a purchase. With all the updates that modern computers go through, this game will need to be adjusted repeatedly every time windows OS is updated."
1,How fitting that SPORE infects your computer.,"It's a shame that after all the hype, one of the 'must buy' games is infected with DRM.I guess the only way to install this game DRM free is to download a pirated copy instead of purchasing one from the publisher."
1,Off with you.,I bought it sight unseen; wish I'd seen it here first. It's gone back where it came from and won't be making a return journey unless and until they get rid of the DRM.
1,if you think the DRM is bad just wait till you actualy play this turd,"The Digital Rights Management may be a pain on this product but its not the deal breaker. I waited years for this game expecting at bare minimum 30-40 hrs of fun. The game play is abysmal, the whole evolutionary advancement concept has been so ruined. The physical structure of your creature has absolutely no effect on its performance. Its been reduced to a mindless point and level system. The final insult is the Space stage it is absolutely mind numbing. The control of your spaceship is near impossible in battle situations and the whole planetary advancement method is dull and exceedingly repetitious. IF your looking for a awesome game to spend your hard earned cash on go get ""Sins of the Solar Empire"""
1,I purchased it via pre-order from Amazon...,"... and I will be returning it unopened as soon as it gets here. I can live with the less than stellar reviews of the gameplay (in fact, many of my favorite games were not very well received by the gaming press), but I WILL NOT ACCEPT the ridiculous DRM which makes the game essentially a $50 rental. Shame on you, EA."
1,DRM is the devil,"We need to stop supporting companies that employ these draconian practices. These methods don't hurt pirates, just legitimate consumers. It's rather elitist to assume that everyone with a computer has internet. People lose jobs, get sick and sometimes just lose service. How much more irritating would it be to not have access to a game you've already paid for?"
1,Pay 50 dollars plus to rent this game also 10 more dollars for the creature creator,"another fine example of a company bending over their paying customers, and they wonder why pirating is so prevalent."
1,When will is stop?,When will they stop clogging my computer with this DRM garbage? It really is invasive and my spy ware detector thinks it's spy ware.
1,$50 rental,EA is waging war on their customers with Spore's activation system. Take a stand and don't support this.
1,"Great game, HOSED BY DRM.","It's really too bad, it's a fun little game, and it might have been a huge success, but as released, it's going to really screw you over. You can install it THREE TIMES. EVER. NO EXCEPTIONS.Even uninstalling the game doesn't get you back that install.It's a RENTAL. You get to install it THREE TIMES. After that YOU BUY IT AGAIN! BULL!!!!"
1,Software engineer - what gives you the right?,"I'm a software engineer by profession, and I have no choice to upgrade and reformat my computer several times a year, which means I'd hit my 3x install count in a few months easy.I'm curious what makes companies think they have the right to limit software installs. EULA? Fine. But from the looks of the review count this one is getting, I can only imagine they are losing a whole helluva lot more revenue from legitimate purchasers than the whole of the pirates out there.I do have a question for EA though - when your game disc becomes a coaster, are you going to limit the number of drinks the buyer can set on it before disabling that feature as well?"
2,"Buggy, crashes, no autosave, boring repetitive gameplay","So far, not impressed. Gameplay is very repetitive, I don't think it will be very replayable. I've also run into a game-stopping crash - I am unable to establish trade routes with other cities without the game crashing to desktop. This makes it impossible to advance. Some people have reported that the DRM (SecuRom) is causing this, but we'll see.I wouldn't buy this game now - wait for a patch or two, and see if the game becomes playable. Even then, with the boring gameplay, I'd wait to see it in the bargain bin."
2,Some-other-game Lite,"Spore is a collection of dumbed-down ideas poorly implemented with a very good Lego-like constructors.Stage 1: Flow copyStage 2: Can't really pinpoint another game hereStage 3: Age of Empires LiteStage 4: Civilization LiteStage 5: Galactic Civilizations LiteWhile it doesn't sound that bad the main problem is that each sub-stage is extremely dull and repetitive. You basically have to do the same action n times where n is the number of enemies.Rewards for such actions include parts for you creatures which have minimum impact on the creature's behavior. You can create limbless, eye-less slug with a horn located inside his body and he has the same chance of obliterating all enemies as a zergling. The pinnacle is of course the spaceship where parts have absolutely NO impact on the performance.Better keep away from this game."
1,EA is disappointing....,I have been watching this game in the web news for what seems ages... I found it interesting and had every intention of going down and purchasing it. Then one of my pals called me who knew I was going to buy and told me he is stuck with a copy he cannot activate. His calls to EA have gone unanswered and he can't get his money back for an opened product.As someone who reloads his PC twice a year whether it is needed or not... the limited activations are a sale stopper.I was a fan of EA a few years back... now I won't touch most of there products with a 10 foot pole.
1,Copy Protection makes game unplayable.,"The game is actually quite fun to play, provided you can actually install it and activate it. If your install fails a few times you may have to re-purchase the game as the Terms state that only 3 installs are allowed (no matter if they succeed or fail) and no refunds will be given after those installs are used up. So you'd be much better of waiting to purchase when EA strips the game of it's copy protection down the road. By the way, those pirates got this game before it was released, so they don't have to deal with this like us legit gamers do."
1,DRM blows,"3 installs, that's it. No more. Can't install on once computer? One. Try another? Two. Laptop? Three. Still doesn't work? pay $50 bucks and try it again."
1,No autosaver - is this the 80s?,"Apparently, Amazon only allows reviews with silk gloves on for Spore, so here is a review that is way to friendly for the way Electronic Arts treats its customers:The game is kind of addictive, so you don't keep track of time. When the time comes for the crash - and those DO happen in Space Stage, you are likely to loose a lot of your game progress. For this fact, game developers included auto-save in games once the age of floppy-booted games had ended. Obviously, the Spore developers must be dating back to before that time - or they are just out there to annoy people."
1,Vous m'avez eu bravo!,Vous m'avez eu en me jumelant des sacs d'aspirateur qui ne s'adaptaient pas sur la balayeuse que j'achetais par vos services.Bravo vous m'avez eu une autre fois mais c'est la dernière.
3,Not bad if you can get past the install,This game is age appropriate for my son (11) and he enjoys it. However we had a number of problems with the install on Vista and needed a call to customer support to get the install completed.
1,If you like dressing up dolls...,"After all the hype, Spore's only purpose is to play dress up the doll and give that doll limited choices and minigames to play through. The only reason this game isn't a complete bust is because my 4 year old cousin likes to play this game when she comes over and its clean for her."
1,unacceptable,"Treating honest custumers and supporters with this kind of treatment is unacceptable, I was looking forward to buy this game, but now I will not.The game copy protection requires on-line activation and you can only install the game 3 times.(So long retro gaming)Why should I continue to pay up to 60$ and support those who betray my trust while pirates play the game for free plus without the release and delivery delays and even without the copy protection.It's a simple yet fun game with loads of replay value, but with this kind of punishment for those who are willing to pay, I won't buy it."
1,Get rid of DRM,"I agree with everyone that has reviewed this game. I have personally had horrible experiences with games containing outrageous activation processes, install limits, etc. etc. I was excited about this game and will never buy it because of the DRM."
1,Being treated like a criminal sure is fun!,"The game itself is a fun. quirky little time waster. The fact that your limited to three installs, and having your computer infected by company approved malware is what makes this a one star, and what makes this a product you have to avoid.Securom is known for causing programs to not work anymore, and you can never remove it from your system completely without reformatting.Sooner or later the DRM will be removed for Spore as it was for Bioshock, I would highly suggest waiting until then."
1,In a world without walls and fences - who needs DRM?,I think there is not much to add. People commonly seem to be sure that DRM is the wrong way. All games can be hacked - so the only people for who the protection makes life harder is for those who purchase games in shop. And I am one of these people.
1,Spore: Most Pirated Game Ever Thanks to DRM,Spore: Most Pirated Game Ever Thanks to DRM. Attention EA and other game companies...get a grip! DRM serves no purpose other than make honest consumers VERY MAD!
1,Ridiculous DRM equals a broken game.,"I was going to buy this game. It's a shame that the trend of over the top DRM has ruined any chances of me ever buying it. After reading many stories (not forums, legitimate news sites) and hearing about problems legitimate purchasers have had, forget it. DRM is ridiculous. It only hurts legitimate customers, not pirates. Want to stop piracy? Make your game less money. Instead of charging too much and using the extra revenue for DRM programming algarythms, make less revenue and save your money on anti piracy attempts that only hurt those of us who purchased the game. STOP TELLING ME WHAT I CAN DO WITH A PRODUCT I'VE ALREADY PURCHASED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I give you the money for it, it's mine to do with as I wish!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Fun for about 30 min,"What is lost in all the talk about ""install issues"" is that the game is not fun for very long. If you want a game that does a lot of different things, but does not do any of them great this is your game. Good, not great if given a second chance would not of bought it."
1,Spore Sucks!,"And I'm not even talking about the stupid DRM stuff that cause a simple installation to last three hours!!!!!! Don't buy it, the play is WAY too simple especially for a $50 game. Also it's just plain boring."
1,Right who wants to worry about what DRM is doing to your computer?,"Ok so far we've had disabled drives, rootkits, phoning home, and now we're expected to make a phone call just to install a game? Wake up you fools who think this stuff up! Who wants to have to worry about what a game is doing to your computer behind the scenes? Who wants to have to make phone calls to beg for activation that may or may not be granted?Those saying don't worry about the drm have no forethought. After some time has gone by and there's a new computer or a windows reinstall it's likely there will be no one to answer the call for an extra activation. The call centers will have shut down. Then there will be little choice but to throw this game--irregardless of it's gameplay quality--into the trash."
1,Big Brother is watching.,"Contrary to what the oh-so enlightened reviewer might think. I'm giving this one star even though that , like many who have posted here, I also purchased the game and actually think it's fun and breaks the mold as far as recent PC games go.Where does Spore go wrong then? EA and it's draconian measures to hurt and damage the paying consumer, that's where.Frankly, when I purchase a DVD, I don't expect that it will fail after being played on 3 different DVD players. My music purchased in iTunes still works even though I've migrated my music to over 3 iterations of iPods and countless computers.So I say this to you EA, get off your lazy tukas and create a less restrictive DRM solution. honestly.For the rest of you, buy the game... but write Will and EA a similar nastygram so that a future version of your game doesn't contain built-in planned obsolescence."
2,Sorely Disappointed,"I have to agree with most all of the negative reviews of this game.I can see that back in the day, this game was absolutely amazing, in scale. When I play the game now, it's absolutely dumbed down to the point that it's just not fun anymore.It gets rather repetitive and seems the difficulty isn't all that hard.With the hype from magazines, professional reviews and just what I've seen regarding the game before it released, I was expecting a lot. The release result is absolute not what I expected.When I heard it was going to be dumbed down a bit, I expected some, but now the game just isn't worth playing anymore after a couple weeks."
1,No game here - just an interesting creator,"Very short summary.I want my money back.There is no actual game here really. The character creator is very well done and cool. Too bad almost nothing you do in the character creator has all that much impact in the game.Very few choices, repetitive and shallow gameplay.I tend to buy 10-20 games a year depending upon how busy I am.This is honestly the least fun I have had of all of those games in the last 10 years or so.They took an interesting idea around their character creator and put the most shallow uninteresting game.I think their marketing department owes the world an apology, there is NO way this game would have sold the number of units it has without the brilliant work of their PR team. If this game had been released without all the hype it would have had a very short shelf life and sold very very few units."
5,Don't listen to the spammers,This game is awesome - hours of fun for everyone in the family! Let your creativity be your guide.
5,So much fun!,I'm addicted to this game. It is very well made. I highly recommend it to everyone who loves this genre of computer games.
1,Pirates have a better experience,"It's really sad (and remarkably short-sighted and stupid) that the game's publisher, Electronic Arts, is directly creating a huge moral hazard: pirates get a much better experience with this game. That's right. Your choices are: pay for the ""privilege"" of renting this game three times, which is effectively what the Digital Restrictions Management on it does, or get it for free by downloading online and having it just work. Oh yeah, and the DRM itself is finicky and prone to not letting you play the game you paid for.Save your money. Don't reward the Orwellian behavior of EA by giving them your money. You don't want to throw away money on a product that you won't be able to play some time down the line anyway."
1,DRM and Simple Kids Game,"I bought this game expecting more of a scientific basis to it. Instead I got a simple ""kids"" game. Very disapointing. The heavy handed DRM just adds to my disapointment. I could have gotten this game for free if I really wanted to. Instead I payed $50 and has a legitimate paying customer I get the ""criminal"" treatment."
1,Annoying,This game is fun until you've played it more than an hour. It is so repetitive that i just stopped playing in the space age because it was so repetitive it seemed more like an errand than a game. I'm not even going to start on how annoying the limited downloads are. I tried to call into EA to get the extra downloads but i guess the [...]bucks i spent on this game doesn't matter to them and i am a thief. And the reason in the first place that i needed more downloads was because this game has so many problems that i had to reinstall it every time i wanted to play.
1,I don't rent video games,"The DRM required by the game's publisher prohibits me from buying it, though I have been looking forward to doing exactly that for around two years now. I often upgrade my computer with new hard drives, etc requiring re installation of windows. Spore with the current DRM scheme would only be playable for me for less than a year. I will not pay $50 for a game that I can not continue to enjoy."
1,DRM and You: A Lesson From Yahoo and MSN,"The game is good looking as heck and has lots of possibilities for play. What is the problem? The draconian DRM used in it demands frequent ""phone homes"". Not only does that disturb me from a privacy standpoint, but more importantly it leaves you open to the whims of the publisher.Yahoo and MSN music sold many thousands (millions?) of songs online. What was the catch? They were stuffed with DRM. Even though their legitimate customers bought the songs, Yahoo and Microsoft took down their servers for the DRM phone home. The Result? Next time you try and listen to a song from your collection, they will not be able to phone home and they will no longer play.Buying this game says that you will be able to play it for as long as EA wants you to and not a minute longer.There are many examples of better ways to copy protect things so that publishers protect their IP without being obtrusive. Is EA really trying to protect their revenue or are they doing something else?"
1,"thanks for mac version, no thanks for drm","I love Maxis games, and have purchased quite a few in the far distant past for my various Macs as a kid. As they became a part of EA (or whatever happened), the quality of the mac ports suffered heavily, and DRM reared it's ugly head.Sorry, EA - if you don't trust me, I don't trust you."
1,DRM from Hell,This software is totally unusable on my computer and makes other program that worked fine before suddenly stop working.
1,Yipes,"The prospect of having to contact EA after the third activation is a show-stopper. I want to buy the game, not rent it. I'll stick with classic SimCity until this is changed."
1,DRM infected,defectivebydesign and drm infected...Now Mac users can share the pain and frustration of PC gamers with this offering by EA. Please don't buy this product and give your money to a game manufacturer that respects customer's privacy and Fair Use rights!
1,"Good game, but not in this form","I quite enjoy the ideas behind Spore, and thought they came together in a moderately good way. It's an enjoyable game, and I wish to support the developer.However, I can NOT support the DRM and restrictions on use. Spore is a game that I will want to play 3 years from now, and I own multiple computers. I will NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY it at that time, because of the hard limit on installs. This is not acceptable. My solution was to purchase the game, but not install it. Instead, I downloaded a hacked copy. I should not have to do this, and companies need to realize that it's not worth it. Spore's DRM serves no purpose, but to irritate and annoy paying, devoted customers."
1,DRM bad,This is a bad policy. i have a tendency to uninstall a game when i dont feel like playing it and then reinstall it when i do...This makes that impossible.I will not buy this game until the DRM is removed.
1,Why Punish the Honest Customers,"The only people hurt by EA's DRM scheme is the honest paying customer. Spore was hacked and on the net for download 5 days before release. So the DRM was pointless, and did nothing to stop those who wanted to obtain this game illegally. The only thing it will do is punish some poor family t hat does not understand the activation scheme."
1,Terrible DRM,"I had been looking forward to this game for a really long time, but when I finally got a hold of it, I found out about its terrible DRM. I wish I could return it and get my money back. I don't want to pay $50 to rent a game. Highly *NOT* recommended."
1,Going to skip buying this because of the DRM,I was considering buying this game; but after reading about all the DRM hassles you have to deal with I decided I probably won't buy it. I'll find something better to do with my time.
1,Ruined by DRM,"DRM is a show stopper. I doubt this game will work for me after a few years given my habit of new hardware purchases and system snapshots. Like others have said, this game is for rent not sale.The EA Spore DRM is a bit reminiscent of the Sony root kit. It installs software that you definitely don't want or need. That software can work in superuser space, meaning it can do whatever it wants on your system. And there is no uninstall for it. In other words, by installing Spore, you install a piggy back Big Brother.Please don't support this product. Great game. Lousy distributor."
1,DRM is a deal breaker,"I, too, was excited about Spore until I heard about the DRM. That's a dealbreaker."
1,DRM Prevents Me From Buying this Game,"I have been wanting to play Spore, but now I probably never will.I do not steal software (or media), and I don't buy software that assumes I am a criminal.Remove the DRM and I will pay for Spore."
1,Good Tech Demo Horrible Game,"Everyone is going off about DRM and wondering if it will kill Spore.No, DRM will not kill Spore.The fact that as a game Spore is boring, has little to no challenge, and the best part of the game was the Spore Creature Creator which you only use for the first part, is what is going to kill Spore.Spore is an interesting concept and may lead to truly fun and interesting games later (especially if there is a way for users to mod it), right now it is basically an engine demo, shiny but ultimately lacking in substance."
1,EA DRMed out,"DRM is a massive headache. I tried this game on a friends PC and found it to be very lackluster. No matter what traits you give your character, the ""evolutions"" that take place are essentially the same. I guess that is ok if you are a ""divine plan"" believer, in which case the programmers could be considered a very uncreative diety.In any case you may enjoy this game until you need to reinstall windows after a computer failure or your next PC upgrade, in which case you need to fork over another $50 thanks to DRM technology."
1,Get a Clue EA,This game is great but EA makes it totally worthless with their DRM that doesn't let more than one person really play the game.
1,It could be fun....But I'm not Buying It,Why a game maker would add DRM to a game is beyond me. I'd love to play this game but refuse to spend money on something that limits how I can use it. If EA continues like this they will quickly find their profits falling.
1,The gaming community will not stand for this insult to our intelligence.,"The DRM embedded into Spore is simply an insult to the gaming community at large. Obviously, the game has a massive pirating problem. But when that pirating problem is cause by a highly restrictive digital rights management program embedded into the game in an attempt to sad attempt to stop piracy, is where you draw the line.EA, simply put, does not understand why games are pirated in the first place. They would rather break the game for legitimate buyers than ask the pirates why they do what they do. An insult. An insult the gaming community will not stand for."
1,DRM infested,installs a program which is essentially spyware on your computer and removes admin rights to delete. Only 3 activations means you can't change your hardware down the road or you will not be able to play at all. I will never buy something that punishes legit buyers. EA - will you never learn? Now they plan to use the same form of DRM in Crysis warhead and Command and Conquer games coming out.Boycott EA and their spyware!
1,Idiot decision,"You can click on my profile and see that this game has been on my ""Wishlist"" here on Amazon since June 8, 2006. It will be easy for you to find because it is the only computer/video game I have ever wanted to purchase.But then Electronic Arts had to go and insult me by pre-loading it with DRM -- and a virus that seeks to install itself on my computer. To me, this indicates an absolute disregard for me, the customer who would have paid, because everyone knows you can go out and find a hacked DRM-Free version online. I'm passive-aggressive like that -- accuse me of cheating when I haven't cheated, and I no longer have anything to lose.So the ONE game that I ever thought was cool enough in concept to pony-up the money for and try to learn to play, will not be getting any of my filthy American lucre, all because EA preemptively decided that I was a criminal."
1,"It's okay. Yes, dumbed down a bit, but GHAAH! The DRM! Why won't they learn?!?!","I preordered this on Amazon AGES ago, but when I heard about the Galactic Edition, I decided to get that instead. When I heard about the DRM, I decided to wait and hold off. I played my friend's copy all day Sunday, and really liked it! It's a lot simpler than the original lofty expectations, but you know what? That's okay. It's a pretty revolutionary game, and there was a lot to figure out. Spore 2 will be that much better.Too bad I won't actually be buying it. I'm not getting anything with that aggresive DRM and rootkit crap. Sorry EA!NOTE: You know, the IRONY of this situation is, that as happy as I was to BUY it, if a pirated, cracked version comes along that keeps the Securom stuff off my hard drive, I'll download that in a minute. I really am happy to pay for a great game, but I just don't want root ware."
1,Great game Horrible DRM only works on 1 pc properly.,"SporeI have 3 computers in my home and I waited many years for this game only to be let down by the awful DRM, the game itself is great, but the restrictions are insane.. you will only be able to fully use spore on one machine,,, yep, you better hope you don't need to change your OS or buy a new pc, no multiple accounts with online access allowed here, what's even worst is the manual clearly states being able to create multiple accounts up to 3. It seems like EA is out to ruin another great game with their crappy DRM restrictions, I advise to not buy spore until they address the public with a fix, this is false advertising, if you create another account you will be given misleading errors like your key is invalid and such, you have been warned."
1,Rip off,My son saved his money and bought this game only to be told that he needed a new video card for this game--more $$$. He was so sad that he spent his money on this game. My husband's co-worker later told us that he had the same problem and that the game still did not work after he bought a new video card. This person was told that he could not return an opened game!! My son is afraid to sink more money into the game by buying a new video card with the possibility of the game still not working.
1,This game for rent only,"With the DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) in this game, you are only renting it.You can see other examples of content like this stop working in the future. Yahoo's music service, Microsoft's prior music server, where when they turn off their authentication servers you no longer have access to your content.Stay away!"
1,DRM Failure,"I was really looking forward to this game, preorderd it, went to lunch with my gf and came home with it looking forward to play.30 minutes later, the frustration of trying to get my system to allow Spore to authenticate me had dampened my joy a bit.I ended up having to hack my network settings to allow spore to contact the mother ship.The game is fun, but I'm going to have to find some pirated version to get the ""real"" game, I'm planning on building a new computer in a week, not looking forward to trying to get the ""retail"" game working on my system again. EA, take a look around at some of the other developers, DRM only discourages people from buying your intentionally broken game. How come small developers can make money with DRM-free games but you can't?"
1,"I'm sorry, I wont play by your rules","Were this advertised as a game-rental for some number of years, I would be ok with that. I was ready to *buy* a brand new computer capaible of playing spore. But with the DRM as-advertised? Nope. I'm not willing to do it.I suppose my rating has less value because I haven't yet played the game. But frankly, EA's draconian measures are keeping me from doing so.EA: I love your games! I *want* to pay you money to play them. I am willing to pay *more* to play games like Spore, that are so amazingly open ended. But I'm not ok with the privacy and ownership issues implied by your DRM. Please re-consider your business practices. I'm not willing to play a pirated version of this game to avoid the DRM. I'm sorry."
1,"Another game ruined by fears of piracy, which can't be stopped anyway","I was going to buy this game until I found out about the DRM activation requirement. Bad, EA. BAD!!! Now I definitely won't be buying this."
1,Out of touch developer,"Like many I was greatly anticipating this game release, but I have no intention of RENTING this game. PC games without a monthly subscription should never have limits on play ability. Three activations is a joke and if EA does not get back in touch with their customer base, then I hope this negative response hits their profits. Maybe then they will pull their head out of their arse and realize the poor choices they have made."
1,"NO PIRATE HERE, I BOUGHT THE GAME AND REFUSE TO INSTALL","LOTTA BS ABOUT THIS JUST BEING A PIRATE ISSUE. I BOUGHT A COPY AT TOYS R US ALONG WITH THE HINTS MANUAL (MY FIRST PC GAME PURCHASE IN OVER 5 YEARS), THEN I READ ABOUT DRM AND PEOPLE REFORMATTING DRIVES TO TRY AND REMOVE IT. NO THANK YOU - IT WILL SIT IN THE PLASTIC AND BE A REMINDER TO ME NOT TO PURCHASE EA GAMES FOR MY VIDEO OR PC SYSTEMS EVER AGAIN. THE COST AND AGGRAVATION IN REFORMATTING A DRIVE FAR OUTWEIGHS AND COMPLETELY REMOVES ANY PLEASURE I MAY HAVE ENJOYED FROM PLAYING THE GAME. DO NOT EVER SETTLE FOR LESS THAN WHAT YOU PURCHASED, THE COVER OF MY GAME DID NOT SAY LIMITED INSTALLS, DID YOURS? PAY ATTENTION......"
1,A wholly shallow game one you scratch the surface,This game is fun for about two hours...Plus it crashes all the time and is virtually unplayable.Not to mention the horrible DRM...
1,Very Unstable,The premise for the game is very good. Too bad it's so darn buggy. I can' recommend this to any Mac user. The current version won't advance to the next level. The application just quits. You lose all your settings and have to start all over again.
2,"Wide Scope, Little Depth","This game aims to deliver the experience of starting from a single spore and ending up as the leader of a vast universe. Unfortunately, this game sacrifices depth in order to provide this massive scale.Fans of strategy games like Command and Conquer or Civilization won't be impressed by Spore's Civilization stage, which features a grand total of three different vehicles, four different buildings, and no tech tree.The worst oversight of the game is the Space stage. You are given tons of weapon and engine options with which to design your ship, but none of it matters. The game only allows you to use weapons and engines that you unlock and buy, and the options you get to buy are limited to three or four items.Overall, the game feels as if Will Wright developed a very good 3-D modeling system and decided to create a game around it. Building creatures, vehicles, and structures is very fun and easy. However, the things you create don't affect the game that much."
2,for sers?,I purchased the game and loaded it on my computer and played it for 3 days strait... the game itself is awesome. I still play it. The only reason I rate it so low is because EA is punking out with the whole DRM shenanigans
2,"Disappointing, And not the DRM",The spore experience is kind of .... Neat... But most of the extras really don't do all that much. The parts of the games where the type of creature only takes like 5 or 6 hours of game play. Most of the challenges to get to the space stage are seriously easy and don't take much effort.
1,EA + DRM = Don't Buy,"If you want to rent a game, go to Blockbuster. If you want to own a game, do not purchase this product. Spore is an ambitious project which is buried under a layer of draconian DRM. EA does not have the right to stare into your computer and decide if they wish to install a game."
1,datacab corrupted / szmodname:hungapp / szappname:sporeapp.exe,Bought the game at release from direct to drive. installed and tried to play. was creating a creature and just when I tried to add legs to it the game crashed. try again and game crashed. tried again and crashed again. ignore creature creation and went to new game. get to the part where you pick to be a carnivore or herbivore and game locks up computer so tight I can not even ctrl+alt+del out of it. have to reboot system. do this a few more times with the same results each time.Look for help on line but EA has nothing to say. I am told that reinstalling may fix the CRC data cab corruption error but I can only reinstall the game three times.All in all a completely horrid experience and one that will make me seriously reconsider and future EA game purchases.Jim
1,Another vote against DRM,"Boy, what a fiasco! I am not a game player, but Spore really had my interest. The last time I enjoyed pc games was back in the day of Myst and Grim Fandango. It seemed like Spore might be something I would enjoy. Enjoyment at the the expense of some software running all the time on my computer, though? No thanks!!"
3,3 activations = 0 activations for me,"20 minutes ago I was holding a boxed copy of Spore in my hands, ready to buy it, then I recalled seeing a lot of headlines about the DRM, so I decided not to buy it until I learned a bit more. Glad I did that, because that three-activation limit is ridiculous. FAIL!"
1,3 installs only? No thanks,I was interested enough in this game to make my first game purchase in years.... until now. There is no way I'm spending money on this product with the current DRM situation.
1,DRM is evil,"I really wanted to buy this game, but since hearing about the evil DRM in it, i've decided against. A shame too since it looks like it would be a really great game. Too bad EA had to ruin it with this. Their doing the same with the the upcoming Red Alert 3, although that game lets you activate 5 times rather then 3. No thanks EA."
1,No thanks. I don't need more malware,"Too bad EA had to ship what basically amounts to malware with the game. As if PC were not unstable enough without new copy protection schemes constantly running in the background. Why would you compromise your PC to play a game, no matter how good? It is quite possible that these idiotic DRM schemes will result in a healthier Open Source gaming community in time, which is about the only good thing I can think of about this for the consumer. In any case, I was excited that this game was going to be available for the mac, but now my interest has waned and you can be sure I will avoid EA products entirely until they stop shipping this trash."
1,"DRM, Windows only == FAIL","Given the game's draconian DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) that prevents you from legitimately installing it more than a few times, and that it does not run on anything by Windows, I cannot recommend this game at all."
1,DRM is Not Helpful,EA seems to be at war with it's customers. I have no idea why they think this is a good thing.
2,"Great Game, but buggy as all get out","It's a fun game, but it keeps freezing up on me. And because it lacks any sort of autosave you either end up saving every 10 seconds or losing hours worth of progress."
1,DRM ? keep your game,"I even have problems to get the creator demo to run error free on my high-end vista PC. With DRM and the limited installs, no thanks EA, I will not be the guinea pig unless you pay me."
1,Promised more,"For a game that was supposed to be the apex of create and share, the creation is a very small aspect of the game. In the part where this has the most impact, body parts are given stats. It really comes down to wanting your character to look like you want it, or having it be functional.Also, Securom DRM has severely slowed the start up speed of my computer.All in all, not worth the money. The best part is the creature creator, which can be bought for 10 bucks."
1,Bargain Bin Game,"If this game's original concept had survived the last two years, and Will Wright's useless and misleading speaking tour, I would have built a dedicated system that could handle DRM (read, over-priced console). However, this game has been dumbed down to such a degree that customization is merely cosmetic. The very little customization that has anything to do with game mechanics, is going to funnel all serious gamers into making virtually the same creature, which has zero appeal for the online portion. Instead of being a game that would be worth the thousands of dollars necessary to run it safely, it is a game that is barely worth the bargain bin."
1,Forget it!,"I refuse to install anything on my machine that A) installs a permanent background process on my machine, or B) I do not have free reign to install on any computer that I own. Max 3 installs? Having to format my drive to get rid of your DRM? Forget it, EA. Pull your head out."
4,My kids LOVE this game,"OK, so it was purchased as a present for my husband, but its actually my 6 and 8yo boys who adore this game. They play it almost daily, and even have friends come over to ""watch"". It definitely, to me, is great for younger kids, and I would ignore the 10+ rating. My 10yo daughter likes it too. I can understand the low marks this game received since it was marketed to adults but is really a child's game. I love the concepts it has taught my kids about life, life cycles, and evolution."
1,DRM ? No thanks.,"Well dear sirs at EA, this is what you get when you treat a customer as a potential thief. Remove the DRM and this game will get the 4-5 stars it deserves for outstanding quality."
1,"DRM sucks. Be aware that buying this is actually RENTING it, for those who don't know what DRM is.","DRM is the downfall of all media industries. I would be so much more likely to tell people to buy this if it weren't for that. Pretty entertaining game, but I think it's for those with plenty of time on their hands. I like a game where I can jump in, create havoc, and leave. GTA IV for example. Great game, no DRM, $500 million in sales during the opening week."
1,DRM will get patched,"Don't you worry, DRM will get removed in a patch not too soon. Until that happens, I suggest you don't buy the game.It didn't take long before it was removed with Mass Effect (also from EA), though it does surprise me that they pulled the stunt again after that.The game can only be installed 3 times before requesting more codes. It's up to you how badly you want it. The game's quality does not justify DRM measures this draconian. I don't think any game can.So my conclusion is, one star."
1,Great Game Concept - Too much Copy Protection,I refuse to pay $50 and be treated like a thief. The copy protection (called DRM in most of these reviews) implemented in this game is too much. Buyer beware - you will not really own this game - instead you will be very limited with what you can do with it.
1,DRM is discouraging,"The presence of such a hostile form of DRM protection (SecuROM) discourages me from buying this game or any other with such protection. I'm not sure how EA didn't see this coming. They knew that the user base of such games was generally not in favor of such measures, but chose to release it anyway.It's a shame since the game would have been nice otherwise (the inclusion of securom ruined it for me)."
1,"drm, 1 activation per letter, no sale","One activation per letter of DRM, 3. I was about to let my Prime account get it to me next day then saw the DRM horror stories. Sorry EA, great game, poor license."
2,Short Shelf Life,"Okay, so you have heard the outcry against the DRM. That's all fine and good. But here's the interesting thing: the DRM (three install limit) will never be an issue for you.Why?Because you'll be tired of this game in 2-3 days.Oh, it's great fun for about 45 minutes, and seeing your friends' creatures in your world is a hoot. But there is absolutely no traction to this game. We have three players in our house: me, my wife, and my 5 year old daughter. None of us have gone beyond a handful of days playing it. In fact, the creature designer $[...] demo got a bigger workout.It's a shame that they didn't come through on this one."
1,Too bad I won't be buying this game,"I was looking forward to this game being released. But thanks to all the information here in the reviews and elsewhere, I will not be buying this game. The DRM is a deal-killer for me. I play games over and over and play games that are 10-15 years old regularly. I am running into more games that I can't play my legally bought copies of anymore because of exactly this kind of DRM. DON'T FALL FOR IT. The only way to play Spore in the future will be with an illegal copy. Because the copy protection will cease to be supported or the next OS you use will (rightfully) block it."
1,So frustrated!,"I wish that my son could play this game that he saved his allowance for, but it WILL NOT run. Our system exceeds all requirements, but it won't work. I have not found any valuable help at the EA website. What a waste of $$$!"
1,Cheap let down,"first off EA is horrible they now have a system attached to their games that limits your ability to install the game more than 3 timesalso any hardware changes to your computer removes one of those 3 times.also Spore is a huge disappointment and i do not recommend buying it, honestly i don't think i will ever buy a will wright game, EA game, or Maxis game ever again.The civilization phase is horrible. Really just bad. Had fun in the cell phase and creature phase. Tribe phase was ok. I played them all on Hard right after each other three times and each time i got to the civilization phase i got bored.Its a shame. By the way game difficulty modes should be called:Cheat ModeThat's it?Easyinstead of""EasyNormalHard"
1,DRM ruins another great game.,"Why EA, why? Why do you keep using this stupid method to combat piracy? The pirates had the game before it was even available to buy, so why treat your PAYING customers like the thieves?I think Spore is a great game and Will Wright is a genius, but EA has screwed him and his development team out of thousands, if not millions, of sales because they can't learn from their mistakes."
1,I hope EA goes bankrupt,"DRM? If you selling a product and going about this to prevent piracy HA! What a funny joke, I wonder many suits with supposed college MBA degrees it took to come up with that in a board room, or maybe EA was getting cheap and hired some chimps to come with that gem. I hope this company fails. [...] per rental. Forget this, I'm going to blockbuster and rent the Force Unleased for $[...], Take that EA I'd rather give my money to Lucas Arts."
1,Disappointing,"I'm not going to go into the DRM thing, as everyone else has covered it already. But I will say that I was expecting a deep, engaging game where my choices actually made a difference. However all I got were shallow minigames with some cool customization options, even though customizing your creature really doesn't do much.A shame really, this had awesome potential"
1,DRM and One User Per Purchase,This game has terrible DRM making it difficult to install on your computer and run. It is also locked down so that only one person in your household can play the game unless you purchase multiple copies. Why should I have to buy one for each of my kids? I've never heard of a game having such terrible pricing!
1,I wanted this game but cannot support the DRM.,For the last year or so I have been waiting anxiously for this release. I suppose that I'll just do without now instead of later when my 3 strikes for installs runs out. I wonder how much money this will save them by preventing piracy in comparison to the money lost in sales because of this silly DRM.
1,Spore Sucks,Lame over priced game rental that is crippled by DRM - you have to be a NOOB LAMO to buy this game.
1,Down with the DRM,"I don't even play games, but I realize the detriment that the DRM poses. Get real EA and stop screwing paying customers!!"
2,"After a week or two, you'll stop playing","Spore not only suffers from overhyped marketing, it suffers from overhyped gameplay.I unlocked the game yesterday, and after 8 or so hours of play, I'm bored. I was actually bored after about 2 hours.Rather then go into all the aspects of the game that leads to such a low review, just don't buy it."
1,DRM ruins experience,"SporeUntil EA removes their draconian DRM schemes, I will not buy another one of their products. It is ridiculous that they treat paying customers like pirates with this burdensome DRM system."
1,"you don't buy this game, you rent","the DRM is so stupid, it's a shame because this could have been a fun game. we need to make sure EA knows that the terms of their ridiculous DRM is not acceptable. The game you pay $50 for has no resale value because it's useless to anyone else, you are just renting the game."
1,Copy protection kills the game,"I'm a frequent Amazon customer from Singapore and would like to ask it not to stock such games which treat customers like pirates. I feel cheated by the copy protection which prevents me from fully enjoying the game.This game should come with a consumer warning on the label! ""Only installs three times."" Absolutely ridiculous. I'm furious."
1,"Dude. I want it, but the restrictions are terrible.","If you support the tactics that EA has implemented for this game, then you hate freedom and gaming."
1,When will publishers learn,"Here is a game which was already cracked and available online a week before you could buy from a retailer legitimately. Yet they still don't get it and make people who want to buy the game suffer. I want Will Wright(sp?) to make a lot of money, I want to support him and buy his games. But not going to happen until they make a SKU with this junk removed."
1,Have you ever.....,"The digital rights management limits an individual to only three activations prior to the game no longer functioning; thus if you've ever:A. Had any type of malware (virus, trojan, worm, spyware, etc.)B. Reinstalled Windows.C. Upgraded your hardware.D. Had any computer problem not listed in A, B, or C.This game is not for you."
1,What the hell?!?! DRM!!!,"Jeez EA you really screwed up this time. I can't believe you made the DRM allow only 3 freakin installations! I can already tell there are probably hundreds of reviews just like mine but im just throwing my opinion out there. Well, I gotta say the game is really actually great, but once you spend your $50 on it you technically aren'tbuying it bu RENTING it.Don't buy this game! Atleast not yet wait until EA finally gets smart and fixes this. Great job Maxis, this is a great game. EA, you suck."
1,don't but this game,"This game's DRM (digital rights management) is very inconveniencing to the legal customer. While pirated copies of the game are freely available on the internet (without any hassles like phone-in registration etc), the publisher EA pesters me with strict procedure on a $ 50 purchase. I don't like to be treated like a criminal, so it was a wasted purchase - because if you install the game three times it WILL STOP TO WORK. So my recommondation is: don't purchase it."
1,Spore's DRM limits customers to only three activations???,"This is crazy!!! Are they coping from Microsoft's book or something? I'm not going to buy this game or another EA game 'till they respond to this limitation. This is ridiculous. Having DRM is one thing because I don't mind to activate a product when I purchase it. However, limiting the number of activations is absurd!"
2,Of cource a Review Should Take Into Account the DRM,"The biggest point against it is...The game simply isn't worth validating a ""draconian DRM Management Scheme"". Point two Linux guys are the guys that would play this game and contribute to it, but is not able to run even under WINE. So screw you EA I won't pay you, unless you remove DRM and make a Linux Port, then I would gladly pay for a good piece of gaming software.DRM is defective by design, therefore the game is defective before it ever comes out of the box. Don't even try using VM or WINE to run it on Linux!"
1,DRM nightmare,"""I was really looking forward to this game - until I learned it had jumped on the DRM bandwagon. On the same principle I would not buy Mass Effect. The only way to stop this intrusive 'feature' from propagating as an acceptable aspect of software is to not purchase the ones who think it is an appropriate solution/addition."""
1,A very expensive game rental,"What? You want to charge more than $7 for a game rental? In the age of GameFly? C'mon, even Blockbuster is having a laugh at your expense!Don't both with this DRM laden trash. This is a giant step backwards when even the RIAA is warming up to open / mp3 licenses."
1,"CNET tips me off, whew that was close.","Glad I saw this on CNET, http://tinyurl.com/5qc7lq , before I went out and bought it. Only 3 installs and then I have to buy it again?!? I am constantly tweaking my machine and that sometimes requires I reinstall the games too. Way to go EA! You just lost a customer who WAS really excited about purchasing this game."
1,DRM Crashed my Box,"It's strange how you can make no changes to your system other than installing a game like Spore and it begins to bluescreen and crash. I don't know what exactly their DRM is doing but I'm going to have to reformat the drive and reinstall everything to get back to a stable box now.Thanks EA! I didn't need to spend that time with my family, I'd much rather rebuild my box because you needed drm on a game."
1,"Dull, simplistic, DRM kills it","Game play is dull and repetitive until Space level, and the DRM is phenomenally poor."
1,Maybe Later,"I play games on a desktop pc in my office, and on a laptop in the living room. I also frequently rebuild my machines and upgrade hardware. I am interested in the online community that will follow this game, however I will not support such strict measures in copy protection. I have canceled my pre-order and may purchase later once this limited activation process is removed."
1,DRM'd for your inconvenience,"Looks like an interesting game, however after reading about the DRM that is included with the game, I refuse to purchase the product. I hope you're listening EA."
1,DRM = Cancelled Order,"Having read about the DRM which is implemented with this game, I cancelled my pre-order with Amazon."
1,Not worth the money,"Spore has been the most hyped game in recent years only to end up as a watered down combination of multiple other game genres. It tries to do too many things with the various stages and none of them reach full potential. It can be fun at times but definitely not a masterpiece or even game of the year quality.Also, the DRM in this game is definitely cause for concern. I bought Mass Effect which also uses the Securom DRM. It in effect, requires you to be connected to the Internet to play the game you BOUGHT and it can only be installed (activated) three times. It was my fault for not researching Mass Effect in detail before buying the PC version and I ended up with a game I know I will not be able to play 10-15 years from now.I will not make that same mistake by buying Spore. No thanks, EA. You can keep your DRM and I'll keep my money."
1,"DRM makes this a rental, not a purchase","If EA ever turn off their activation servers, this game will stop working! Don't think it can't happen. Fans of Major League Baseball, customers who purchased Circuit City's DIVX format, people who believed Microsoft's Plays For Sure campaign, and many others have all gotten the short end of the DRM stick before.What is DRM? Basically, DRM is a scheme that is designed to make things more difficult for paying customers in the misguided attempt to fight piracy. Ironically, the people who pirate these sorts of things often take the DRM out, so the pirates often end up with a BETTER product than the paying customers. I'm not suggesting you should pirate the game. There are a lot of entertainment choices out there though. I wouldn't ""buy"" this unless you wouldn't mind if it mysteriously stops working one day and you enjoy calling customer support hotlines to prove your innocence (assuming they're still taking your calls).Buyer beware."
1,Maybe EA can change the name to Spoor...,"I recall meeting and talking with Will Wright at an early SF MacWorld. He was standing alone, mostly ignored, trying to generate interest in a new game he'd developed called SimCity. Delightful guy, and I ended up writing a few articles for the early SimCity Newsletters distributed by Maxis.I skipped all the Sims bits, but have followed the Spore trail for a couple of years, reading interviews with Will about his vision for the game. I don't think the released Spore has more than a tiny bit of that vision. Dumbed down, loaded with DRM - sorry, but I think EA's influence has won out. Here's hoping Will revolts along with the rest of us."
1,Refuse to buy such software,"I was thinking about buying Spore. No more (hey, this rymes) after reading aboutthe ridiculous DRM they are using...2 THUMBS WAAAAAAAY DOWN"
1,DRM destroys gameplay,"I had followed Spore's progress over the last few years extremely carefully and had pre-ordered it from my local software store. It arrives, I pick it up, and when it installs I enter SecuRom hell. It refuses to activate. I have just spent the last 8 hours trying to get the copy of a game I pre-ordered to admit that I own it."
1,Securerom? Say NO to DRM,"Do a google search of Securerom before buying this game. Then decide for yourself if you still want to install this on your system. Myself, I prefer not to allow this sort of software on my machine. A pity too, as I have been waiting for two years for this to come out. Until EA provides a patch to remove securerom from a systems that Spore is installed on, and still allow it to run, I'm going to take a pass on it."
1,Draconian DRM? No thanks.,"This game has a terrible copy protection mechanism that can prevent you from playing the game you've purchased if you upgrade your computer, have more than one computer you want to play it on, or do not have internet access. If more than one of these issues apply it will compound the problem.I will under no circumstances buy this game."
2,Disappointing...,"Spore tries to combine many game types all into one game. The gameplay is too simplistic in the first four stages of creating your creature. All you do is move, eat, attack/charm. Until the space age, the game will be boring for anyone who has played a decent game before. The game also limits game owner's to one account and 3 installs. Other cons: Several big features were cut from Spores like the aquatic stage. Realistic humanoid creatures are not possible, all your creatures look like clones, no genders, no hair/fur, cities are the same shape, and graphics are ugly. Knowing EA, they will add 6+ expansions to Wright's game. Maybe it will be fun after the 5th one."
3,Overhyped game that falls short IMO,Just seems as if as soon as I learned to play at a certain level or evolution it would skip to the next; think they should of made the levels last longer. I lost interest pretty fast.
1,"Show corporations that you make the rules, not the other way around","I love this game. I've spent way too much time playing it in the past 3 days and haven't even gotten close to exhausting the amount of fun I will get out of the game. I highly suggest playing this game...... note that I did not say ""purchasing this game."" Do NOT do that! We, as consumers, must show that we will not stand for DRM. I love Maxis more than most and wish there was a way to give THEM my money (I'd pay twice what they are asking for this game if it could go straight to Mr. Wright and Mr. Braun) but I refuse to give EA a penny for the crap that they expect us to take.Lets make this the most pirated game in history. Lets make it the example that disproves all of the half-baked philosophies behind DRM. Make it clear that we want to OWN the software that we BUY.Please Google these three phrases: ""The Pirate Bay"", ""Beginner BitTorrent tutorial"", ""7zip."" The last phrase is so you can unpack the download ;)."
1,"Boring, slow. Poor Graphics","Spore as a game is very slow and not as neat as you are led to believe. Sim Tower is way more fun than Spore, so don't waste your money. You don't even get to own it you know? You are purchasing 3 installs of the game and that is it. What if you get a virus or your hard drive dies? You are simply out of luck."
1,Spore on my Macbook,I bought this game to play on my macbook but I only installed it and never played it. I saw many review that it doesn't play very well on the macbook. My is new and hope when i play it will be good. But also saw reviews where there is no evolution going on that u can change ur creature anytime and it will not have an effect on how u create it. Thats dumb. But with so many 1-star rating for the DRM I agree with many of the users opinions.
1,DRM doldrums,"I have no beef with the game, it's fun and addictive. Didn't live up to the hype, but the hype was pretty intense.See other comments for interesting tips on the DRM..."
1,"DRM, no thanks!","This game was supposed to be _the_ sim game...probably of the decade, evolving from a single microbe to interplanetary space travel.I wanted this game because it was supposed to be something more than your average sim. Instead it's a bunch of average sims slapped together, dumbed down, and graphically enhanced. It would be nice if creature designs mattered more outside of cosmetic appeal as well.1 just for the drm, I can't count how many times I've uninstalled/installed some of my favorite games.Want to play diablo2? load it up and go? Sick of it after a few months? Save the hard drive space. Reformat? There goes an install! New computer? there goes an install! 3 installs is laughable at best. The hassle to get new activation keys in not worth the hassle.I _like_ that I can still fire up my old games now. If I look back at Spore 5 years from now and feel like loading it up, chances are I'm screwed, don't waste your money on this long-term rental as someone else called it."
1,just terrible,"Uninspired, dreadful gameplay awaits you. It's fun the first time through -- Minefield has better replayability. Go buy Sim City 4 or Sims 2 if you want a better game."
1,SecuRom Disappointments,"I was really disappointed when I learned that EA had failed to remove SecuRom from the final release of Spore. This DRM scheme is unfortunately an extreme example of companies treating paying customers like criminals, while the criminals with their DRM free pirated copies get a better overall user experience.I really wanted to give you $50 EA, but I'm sorry I just can't.All of these negative reviews should be showing you that this sort of DRM is intolerable."
1,Research SecuROM DRM before buying,"I was really looking forward to this game, but after researching the DRM software used in this game, I decided to get my money back and cancel my order for the game. I actually have no problems with receiving only 3 installs for $50. To me, that's reasonable, not great, but reasonable. But just do some basic research on SecuROM, a DRM strategy developed by Sony, who also brought us a rootkit that incapacitated many peoples' computers, and ask yourself, do you really want to spend $50 to install a game that comes with such malware as SecuROM? I for one, will not touch this with a ten-foot pole. I don't want SecuROM on my computer, calling home everytime I run the game. After researching the DRM, I decided I don't want to muck up my system with this."
1,Don't support a company that assumes you're a criminal.,"The concept for this game seems like a great idea. Too bad that many people, myself included, will, not be buying it and playing it due to incredibly restrictive DRM issues. I don't enjoy being treated like a criminal on my own PC. What I don't get is, that the manufacturer KNOWS that people who want to pirate this are going to and already have - the people who legitimately are going to buy this are the ones getting stuck with the incredibly bad DRM. It's not stopping piracy, so DRM has failed.EA, please get a grip, issue a patch, and you'll find many more people wanting to play your game.DRM is going to be the total death of PC gaming yet."
1,Playing with DRM is actually more fun..,"After years in the making I expected something more complex and enjoyable. The game itself comes across as very simple. After playing for a few hours I found the experience completely forgettable. I'm not sure who the target audience is exactly but I'm doubting it's anyone who enjoys any complexity in their gaming.The DRM system is a puzzle though, who bother developing a system that is so easily cracked (which it has been already). You're annoying your paying customers while the pirates get a smooth experience w/o any problems at all.Seems foolish but then again so is EA."
1,DRM too restrictive,"This game looks like it would be a fun way to interactively experience the theory of evolution firsthand, but the restrictive DRM is a deal breaker."
1,DRM Disapointment.,"Good job guys. Way to drive otherwise legit users to piracy. I'd love to pay you for your product, but you'll get my money on MY terms.. not yours. (shouldn't the person holding the cash hold the power?)You're bad at capitalism."
1,I wil NOT buy DRMed products,"As an avid gamer and a supporter of gaming industry, I have always been against piracy as it is equivalent to stealing and does not give the game developers their due.But to be treated like a thief and dictating me what I can or can't do with my purchase?!?! I will not stand for it. EA you lose me as a customer and I will NOT buy this game."
1,Waste of money,"This game could have been the title that separated the PC from the consoles. Unfortunately, the game is pretty terrible. Graphics are dated and the game play is real dumbed down. I don't really care about DRM because it's never really affected me and I'm all for ensuring the PC gaming has a future. Without DRM, PC gaming would be a free for all with everyone downloading games at will."
1,"Retail version, or Rental version?","If EA wanted to rent me a video game, I'd be a lot happier if they would come right out and tell me so, instead of putting up all these claims that they need ""Security"" that the thousands of pirates playing the game right now are not having to deal with, while paying customers are having to beg and plead for the right to play a game they bought. At least an MMO tells you about monthly fees before you open the box, a lot more honest than this stinker of a DRM scheme.Poor show EA, how did Will Wright get suckered into this mess?"
1,DRM Fail,"The honest truth is, this game is great for the casual gamer. Its very simplistic, and requires almost no effort to get through the game until the space travel portion.It *IS* a lot of fun, and one of a kind.However....The DRM sucks. They dont mention on the box, or their website, the simple fact that you will eventually NOT be able to run the game when they turn off the authentication servers. The DRM LIMITS you to 3 installs. That means I'll likely have to try and convince them that I deserve to have another install after reloading windows to get rid of virus's etc....and we all know THAT never happens.Awesome game. But the DRM problem outweighs any good benefits of the game."
1,my 5ct,"Looks like an excellent game.. but I won't be buying it.. ever.There are a million and 1 ways to prevent illegal copies, but this has to be the most daft one yet.Reinstalling the pc 3 times and calling Maxis/EA to have my copy reactivated ? No way.Thanks but no thanks."
1,"Too Bad, So Sad","EA's DRM systems have ruined many a good game. I am very sad to see it happen to Spore :-( Purchase at your own risk, buyer beware."
1,Say no to DRM,"SecuROM compromises multiple portions of the OS, including insinuating itself into the system to try to prevent you from using other programs (like ISO loaders). It also phones home constantly and has the ability to launch code that it feels like using, invisible to the user.And there are many LEGITIMATE reasons to use an ISO loader - such as having a laptop that uses extra power to run the DVD drive, wasting time and battery power to use the DVD drive as an expensive dongle.If you want decent battery life to game on the go, the most common method is a secondary battery pack that replaces your optical media drive - meaning you HAVE to switch to either an ISO loader or else a no-CD crack for games that are trying to use the media drive that way."
1,DRM hurts legitimate users,"Buying the retail version doesn't make sense. Why pay money for a crippled version when it's easy to get an unlocked version for free? I've deal with EA support in the past, and that horrible mess has led me to download cracked version of games I legitimately own rather than waste more time with support. If I'm buying a game, let me use it. If I'm buying a license, then don't make it horrible to deal with a scratch on the CD. A user should never have to pay for a second copy of a game because EA won't let them use the one they already own."
1,"Great game, to bad I won't buy it","I did buy this game, but before I opened the wrap, I found out about the DRM. Thank God I did. I am not paying $50 to rent a game. Three installs wouldn't get me through the damn year. Apparently EA thinks that only people who buy pre-made computers and never upgrade are interested in their games. Well Congratulations EA-- now your correct. Lucky for me it was still in shrink and could go back."
1,When did customers become the enemy?,EA won't be getting any of my cash if the insist on treating me like a criminal.
1,Holding off purchase until no DRM,"I've been on Spore's email list all summer, and was looking forward to it until I heard about the restrictions. I won't be buying until they change their mind. There's plenty of other games out there."
1,SecuRom = RootKit,"I was all set to buy Spore - I don't buy many video games these days - and then thought to check on Copy Protection. Spore comes with a silent-installing, hard-to-uninstall piece of software whose security vulnerabilities go beyond simple copy protection into spyware territory. If there's ever a Spore-Reloaded where the Rootkit has been removed, I'll consider it, but for now, I'm not going to buy, install or play Spore."
1,Don't buy this game,"EA released two versions of this game. The superior one is the one that has been available for free on bittorrent since before the game was officially released. The version that EA wants you to pay for is crippled by sadistic DRM that converts an otherwise playable game into a $50 demo.If you want to play Spore, wait until EA relases a version without DRM. Only then will you actually be buying a game with your $50 and not renting one."
1,The DRM is unfortunate,"I've been burnt by this sort of thing before.I don't appreciate purchasing a game (or music), only to find out it has stopped working after a hardware upgrade, or to find out it has installed some secret junk on my computer that makes my computer vulnerable or slow, or to find that the game is useless because the manufacturer decided to shut down their DRM servers.Microsoft screwed its ""playsforsure"" customers who purchased a Zune. Sony installed a root kit on a number of unsuspecting customers machines. How can I be expected to trust spore?I'll look elsewhere."
1,want to buy it....,"EA has gone too far. At least let consumers unregister an install. Even Apple does that with iTunes! Or charge $10 per install, fair compromise? Or better yet, find a way to stop piracy that doesn't punish paying customers."
1,Count another lost sale. EA - are you listening?,"Chalk up another missed sale specifically *because* of offensive, ridiculous, and ultimately impotent DRM. I won't touch this thing with the DRM that it currently requires.EA -- are you paying any attention yet? I had money in my hand ready to exchange for this product, and instead the money is going right back into my pocket. I'll just go buy another Stardock game, where they treat customers like customers."
1,Cheated,"I'm a long time gamer, and I've been very excited to finally play Spore. I had lost track of the game, and excitedly purchased it last night when I saw it on the counter. Before installing the game at home I noticed all kinds of complaints on the DRM, which limits the game to 3 installs along with unknown backdoor anti-piracy processes. I've been planning on upgrading my desktop (which is very common for PC gamers), and my laptop is in need of a format.Now I'm stuck with a $50 game that I may not be able to play in the future, along with unwanted and unknown processes running on my PC. Why am I wishing I had pirated this game, despite the amazing amount of time and ambition from the developers?"
1,Won't buy with DRM,"I've bought every Sim game there is...SimCity, SimAnt, SimFarm, Sim...you name it. I have been following the release of this for awhile and I can't believe this DRM stuff. I won't buy it, and this is sad because I have a hard time supporting stuff like this and I love EA games. I'm going to have to really consider buying any EA games anymore."
1,Will Wright Sold His Soul for Cash,"Too bad the ""creator"", sold out on this one.First of all, the idea isn't original, but like the iPod, it had the funds and the marketing to succeed this far.There is quite alot of great software and graphics here, but it just feels like any empty shell, a great idea hollowed out by greed."
1,Childish and Boring.,Another crappy game made by Will Wright.This took how many years to make?Whats funny is how the Spore Creature Creator is better than the real game.
1,WTFBBQ-DRM,"I personally will never again purchase a secuROM infected game, i went through that jazz with bioshock, and it's not enjoyable for anyone....ever."
1,"No way, this just sucks!","It could have ben a great game. But the point of capitalism is: If I pay money for something, I'd like to own it. This game is for rent. Also, it installs lots of creepy DRM stuff that you definitely don't want to see on your machine.EA, _this_is_major_crap_!! Next time I'll head straight to the pirate bay,kthxbye"
1,DRM is awful,"Joining the anti-DRM parade. If Oblivion taught us one thing, I thought it was that DRM didn't generate sales. I guess I was wrong :("
1,"I'm not a criminal, please stop treating me like one","As a paying customer, why do I have to be treated like I've stolen or likely to steal this product? And given the DRM track record, what guarantee do I have that this will still work in a year or two? And I don't want a bunch of stuff running in the background hogging up resources."
1,"Get rid of the DRM, EA/Maxis","Game seems good, not great, but what makes the game a 1-star is the security measures left on the game that gives the gamer significantly less power in the purchase and overall, much less ownership of the game.People will steal the game, sure. They're going to continue stealing the game -- cracks are a fact of life.It's a shame that they included this feature, considering that I'd anticipated Spore for a long time. My exposure to it has been somewhat positive, but I'm not going to give a company money that treats their customers this way."
1,Remove the SecureRom,"I feel cheated having bought the game only to realize that SecurRom DRM was rolled into this game. After dealing with the headaches of the three installation only policy for Bioshock and other intrusive policies that SecurRom implements, I vowed never to buy a game with the SecurRom DRM again. Its honestly less of a headache just to pirate games now days then deal with abusive copy protection policies. Instead of buying games from EA which seems to only use SecurRom, buy games from Stardock which ceased using intrusive copy protection. SecurRom punishes legit customers, and encourages piracy. I want to own what I buy, not sign a rental contract."
1,Just to protest DRM scheme,"I don't even own the game, but the DRM scheme EA has setup is out of control. Something must be said. I personally own 4 different computers and to imagine the headache if I want to use the game on all of them plus ever reinstall is enough to not make me want to buy the game in the first place."
1,Obviously hoping to clean up with ad-ons.,"Invasive and draconian DRM and a game that will obviously be charging for add-ons in the future? No thanks. Too bad too, I was really looking forward to this."
1,The Game sucks AND the drm sucks,The DRM stuff is annoying for sure but the game is even worse. They should have spent the money on making the game flow better instead of being a few loosely connected minigames.
1,Down with DRM,"Thank goodness people are taking a stand against this DRM we live under. People should not put up with it. I have been wanting this game for months and months - now a coworker tells me it is crippled with DRM. Both he and I will not be coming anywhere near it. When you consider I typically have to buy 2 games (one for me, one for my spouse's mac) and my coworker's 1 game... this is at least 3 sales they are loosing. I'm sick of renting things.WAKE UP - DEMAND DRM GO AWAY."
1,Not worth it,"Did I have fun during the first 3 stages? Yes. Is there any replay value at all to those stages? No. I played it for two days, hit the space level, and lost all interest in the game. It is a poorly developed series of mini-games. You can get rather creative with the appearance of things but that's about it. The first level is a simple eat the little fish avoid the big fish game. The second is find food, kill/befriend tribe. Wash rinse repeat. The civ stage had to be the most boring thing I have played in a long time. You have three vechicles to chose from. No matter what the type, if you send more than 4 at any given target, you win.I am really sorry I wasted my money on this game."
1,Not all its cracked up to be.,"This game just does not live up to the hype. Its something that would look good on the Wii, but not as a hard core PC game. Graphics are very basic, game play gets boring after about 30 min.The DRM doesn't bother me, but its a bit archaic. STEAM has a much better methodology to stop piracy.I feel compelled to play just because I spent this much money.If you can, I would wait till the price drops, or buy it off someone who is bored."
1,Won't even launch on my new iMac,"Warning Mac users. Forget about DRM, I can't even get the game to launch for a first run! I have a new iMac with 4 Gb RAM and the 8800 graphics card and all specs far exceed the system requirements. Took awhile to even find where I'm supposed to get help from EA. Only found a web site based submit trouble, no phone number. It's been 24 hours and no response. This is the first game I've pre-ordered, ever. I was so pumped for this to come out. I can't even run the game to give a review!"
1,"Crappy DRM, False advertisement in game manual",DRM limits you to 3 installs over the lifetime of the product. You do not get credited for another install when you un-install the game. The Game manual also says that you can have multiple users per game but you are only allowed one. If you have several family members that would like you play you either have to pay up for multiple copies or all play under the same user. This is false advertisement but good luck on returning the software and getting your money back. Be aware that Amazon had almost 3 thousand negative reviews of this product before they deleted them. This is very shameful and should not be tolerated.
1,Unacceptable,The removal of over 500 reviews from this title is unacceptable Amazon. You'd think you had enough money to ignore EA.Anyone okay with this DRM is looking short term. What happens when you get a new computer? Or want to reinstall this game for the fourth time 10 years down the road? I suspect EA won't even have a Spore phone line to call for a reactivation number by then.This is unacceptable and we all demand a change in tactics by EA.Unacceptable.
1,Awful DRM on this game - BOYCOTT!,"Do not buy this game, you would be wasting your money.The DRM is so restrictive it makes it a frustrating experience.Gameplay is ok but nothing great."
1,Not into rentals...,"This is a perfect example of how EA believes the world revolves around it. The giant mega-game-corp monster has gotten so big that it's forgotten what it's like to be a consumer. Why would ANYONE trust a company that uses Securom, when the company knows what that program does to a user's system, yet quietly includes it in their product. The only user their DRM will affect is the paying customer, as it WILL be hacked just as completely as any other game. And don't think EA is taking care of Will Wright. If anything, they are only hurting his image by teaching his fans that his games now come with a DRM virus."
4,Best Game Ever,"I played this game til it was 5 am. I've also played through all the stages and for over 16 hours. The game play is fun, yet challenging, a perfect mix. The space age is complex and looks like it will keep me entertained for a long time. The other stages were fun too and because of the different stages there will be something for everyone in this game.The people and reviews complaining about DRM need to grow up. Businesses aren't going to just let their stuff be pirated. It isn't likely that people are going to have a problem with it because people don't reformat hard drives, install computer parts, or get a new computer often. Also, Maxis is willing to help anyone who honestly encounters a problem with it.Overall this game is amazing and I can't wait to get back to playing with it when I'm back from work. This game is worth every penny."
1,Even though the DRM is lame...the game just isn't that fun,Yeah the DRM is lame and EA needs to remove that feature. But I also don't think the game is really that fun. It feels dumbed down.
1,Another terrible review,"Game is very shallow. You'll be at the space stage in a few hours...woot?Seriously, just torrent it. That way you don't have to deal with the DRM...and it's not worth anywhere near $60. I have a lot of respect for Will Wright...but right now, I'm sort of ashamed of him. I hope he finds a way to make EA make this right. As soon as DRM is removed, I'll uninstall my current copy and run out and buy one. Until then, I'll play it for a few hours a day then go back to WoW (a game I pay monthly for because it's a good game)."
1,Good game but annoying DRM,"I pre-ordered Spore because I want to support creative games, but I regret it now because the pirated version is vastly superior to the one I paid for, and I feel like I'm being punished for putting up my money.The game itself seems good, but I haven't played it a lot.-Magnus"
1,Will Wright can do MUCH better,"This is one product that falls so far short of the hype it is just plain sad. This was hyped as 'Sim Everything', would do for evolution what The Sims did for social games, but the first four stages, while cute, are basically casual games with no depth of play whatsoever. Even a lover of casual games such as I am was expecting more. It seems that the designers spent way to much time on the 'Creators' within the game, and not nearly enough time on gameplay.The Space stage - the final stage and the most open-ended, is really just a version of other trade/piracy/empire building games such as Tradewinds or Port Royale, with only some minor wit. Not nearly enough to keep me amused, and considering other games like it can be had for considerably less, without the totally ridiculous DRM, I would highly recommend that you NOT buy this game. I wish I hadn't."
1,"Spore, get over yourself","In all honestly I have been looking forward to this game for a long while. I have watched all the Youtube demos and watched the demos by the author on what it could do.Given the idiotic DRM they have put in, they will never see a dollar or me until it is removed. Way to go EA, way to use your greedy mitts to screw up a potentially great game."
1,EA and DRM,"If you are looking for a nice rental for [...] bucks this is it. It's fun but EA is not known for having good customer support and if you want to basically have a game that you can only install 3 times total then this is it. Another thing is there is a bug that will make the game think you have installed it again and will take up 2 of your activations! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT CRAP CUSTOMER SERVICE, CRAP COMPANY SUPPORT, AND A SYSTEM THAT WILL BREAK FAST. JUST DOWNLOAD IT IN PROTEST UNTIL THEY PATCH THE DRM BS OUT!"
1,"If you like DRM, buy this game","The most fun thing about this game is the DRM, its great. Its always there and even helps you by calling EA and making sure its a valid copy for you! That awesome! So once again if you like DRM buy this game!"
1,Broke my desktop,"After installing this game, I am no longer able to right-click icons on my desktop. Explorer crashes instead. I heard it was a SecuROM problem, but the problem persisted after I uninstalled Spore. I want a refund."
1,could not register,"I was able to play the game locally, but I was unable to register for the online piece. Going through EA support for this was a nightmare, and after lots of back and forth they finally told me that my version was registered to someone else, and I should buy a new version. I'm not sure why the key Amazon gave me for my download wasn't any good...TLDR: EA support is a nightmare."
3,OK at first but it gets boring fast,This game kind of pisses me off. The potato head graphics and animation technology is great and it has to potential to be a great game but it just doesn't quite come off. The game has several phases the first two being first person (third person really) and then it goes to a RTS which is where I start to loose interest since this isn't my cup of tea. I think if they had made into an online game where you can pit your creature against other player's creatures or even computer NPC creatures it would be much more fun. The real charm of this game is the evolution and creation of your species. The problem is you are past this part after the first two phases. In the third phase your creature design has some minimal impact on game play and in subsequent phases it basically does nothing.I gave it 3 stars because the potential is there and the creature creator is cool. However as far as game play goes it just doesn't deliver.
1,Disappointment,"I cannot express how excited I was when Spore was first announced.As soon as it was possible, I put in a pre-order online at full retail price and counted down the days... at least until I learned about the draconian DRM prohibitions. If they want my hard earned dollars, how DARE they cripple their product in such a manner? I don't steal games and I don't condone those who do. It's utterly offensive that the online thieves are able to enjoy a better (DRM-free) product than I, a legitimate consumer, can purchase legally.With their excellent sales and non-crippled titles, rival company Stardock Entertainment should be praised as an example of how to make money while satisfying consumers. If you're looking for an enjoyable video game, try the excellent DRM-free Sins of a Solar Empire."
2,kinda boring. kinda dull.,"i won't bother panning the DRM. that's well taken care of by other reviewers.i'll just focus on the game itself. it's, well, kinda boring. sure, it's neat to help your first little creature evolve from single cell to galactic civilization, but it doesn't take all that much time, or skill, and each stage is pretty pedestrian and repetitive. even the creation of your creature, buildings, vehicles, etc, gets old.i thought perhaps it would have some interesting re-playability, but it's pretty much exactly the same the second time around.too much buildup, too much hype. save your money."
1,DRM with 3 installs and lousy game play? Sign me up?,"I'm so glad I read the reviews here first. My wife saw a commercial or ad or something which made this game look really good and I was going to buy it tonight. Fortunately I saw the reviews here about boring, inane gameplay and ridiculous DRM policies.No thanks. EA, you just lost another sale."
1,besides DRM,"It shouldn't have received all the hype it did. It's numerous minigames rolled into one. To be fair, maybe I should have given it 2 stars. But yes, the whole DRM issue needs to be put in the spotlight (again and hopefully the executives will listen this time). The gaming community does not want this and will not take it anymore.Expect even further and more intense reactions on Red Alert 3's release."
1,Joining in the fray - DRM NO WAY!,I am joining in the fray to say:DRM Means NO PAY NO PLAY!!Simple slogans may work better against headheaded EA.EA is going DOWN.
1,I waited for an awesome game....and what did I get?,I got a locked down disc - I came onto amazon tonight to place an order for this game and after reading about this drm craziness I must say - frak spore and EA! Pretty pathetic way to treat the ones with the credit cards and cash in hand....
1,DRM will make you hate life,"This game has ZERO longevity. Why? DRM. In 5-10 years, you will NOT be able to install or play this game. Thank you EA.I have been a past victim of securom and vow NEVER to buy another POS product that supports the draconian DRM. Why do these companies HATE legitimate customers?"
1,I hate to do this..,"It pains me to rate a game that I have been so heartily looking forward to so low. However, the current state of Spore's DRM and the gaming industry's clear lack of respect for customers, paying or otherwise, is simply appalling.This is made clear by the fact that it is easier to download and play a pirated copy of almost any game than it is to install it 'legally'. It is disrespectful and detrimental to business to assume that customers are guilty of theft and punish them without any proof.When I saw the demo of spore a week ago at PAX, I was prepared to buy it, then and there. But if my fifty dollars are going to be wasted, they are going to be wasted on a company that doesn't punish me for loyal business."
1,DRM kills the game,"I still install SimCity2000 each year or so to play through it, and it still works fine. This epic game deserves many more installs than that, but with only 3, EA decides it isn't worth more than a year's worth of playing. Not worth $50 until it is no longer a rental."
5,SPORE ROCKS,Got this game the first day it came out and haven't stopped playing since. It's fantastic!!!
1,Nice game with problems,"After spending several hours helping a friend chase down issues with getting the game to activate and figuring out the sudden appearance of a virus/spyware on the system related to the DRM, I can honestly say the graphics and play of the game are pretty good. The other complaint is the 3 activation rule for the lifetime of the product, seems a bit excessive.I'd rate the game higher if it wasn't for the installation/activation issues and the on going problems of getting the computer's security software to play nice with it."
1,DRM prevented me from buying Spore...,"I was ready to make my purchase today. This is one of those rare games that both my spouse and I would enjoy. But after taking a look at the game on Wiki, and then reading up on the DRM posts here at Amazon, I've decided to pass. It's a real shame. The game looks great and I was looking forward to playing it. Guess I'll just stick it out another month or so while I wait for Fallout 3..."
1,Disappointed with Spore,"When will video game manufacturers STOP INTENTIONALLY HURTING THEIR CUSTOMERS. I understand protecting intellectual property, but THREE ACTIVATIONS for $50 game. That is absolutely ridiculous. I like the game concept, but I am going to send it back unopened."
1,REMOVE DRM!,"Was going to buy this 100% but now hearing about a 3 installs and your out, I will refuse to purchase Spore until they fix this issue.EA = FAIL!"
1,DRM sucks the life out of spore,This game has a ton of potential. The real problem is DRM. It's killing the game. The DRM is basically like a virus that cripples the experience.Save your money.
1,Not buying because of DRM,I can rent all the games I want through gamefly for $15/mo. Not renting ONE for $50. Better luck next year EA.
1,DRM only hurts,"DRM of this nature needs to be stopped. When you BUY a product, it's yours. If they only want to RENT you the product, people need to respond by not buying OR renting from this software house."
1,I have struggled with the DRM issues from this game publisher for years.,"First The Sims, then Sims 2. My kids begged me to purchase and install these games for them along with the countless add-ons. Each new add-on became a time of great anxiety for us all. Would the DRM in the update ruin the existing game or not? about half the time it did. Once in a while it even borked the OS. Countless hours re-installing and starting these games over was a nightmare. Now Spore, with even more draconian DRM.It is well past time to start treating your game users as customers!! We are tired of being treated like criminals! We are asked to pay for this game but we never actually own it. Stay far away from this game unless you enjoy wasting countless hours diagnosing and fixing game and operating system problems caused by DRM."
1,DRM prevented me from playing this game on my computer,"The DRM on the game prevented me from playing the game. I managed to get it installed, but it won't play and complains about the disc not being in the drive, even though it's in the drive. And since video games can't be returned once they've been opened, I'm out 60 bucks! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, THE DRM WILL PROBABLY BLOCK YOU FROM PLAYING IT."
1,"DRM, nuff said","Fun game, pretty simplistic and basic in early stages, but it has a DRM so avoid at all costs."
2,Spore Let Down,"I'll make mine quick. I too hate the DRM on the product. But that's not the reason for the low rating. I have two main issues with the game, first one being technical - the installer has consistently failed to set the game up properly. It does not create the Spore icon, I've had issues after a 'successful' installation where it does not run for some users on the system, etc. Really poor execution on that part. In terms of gameplay, I find that there are too many things which are not explained or shown properly in tutorials, and you find yourself wondering what you are exactly supposed to be considering while playing. Great idea, but I feel pretty let down by the execution."
1,SecuROM ruins it.,"Long story short, since it appears everyone else is saying the same, SecuROM is a no go. Sorry E.A. but there's no way."
1,Passing this one up,"Hello EA.I really want to buy this game. I do. But like thousands others on this site, I am voting with my wallet. DRM = no sale.thanks."
1,Don't buy this game,"Its kinda short. Its banking on the 3 years of hype. The game doesn't have much depth. I falls WAY sort of what was promised. Oh well, can't return it. :("
1,DRM makes it a no-buy. EA ruining own game,"I was really hyped about Spore. Several fun mini-games (each stage is like a separate game) culminating in Civilization-like expansion of your solar empire. Too bad I will not buy it because of absolutely uneducated and ineffectual decisions made by the Publisher - EA. They already ruined a ton of games with invasive, ineffective and crippling DRM. Spore is no different. After eventually backing out of FORCING US TO REREGISTER EVERY 10 DAYS (think about that) they still continue to treat PC gamers like thieves, not warning about installing malware (SecuRom) and going to a rent-your-game model. Result - public outrage, and you guessed it, thousands of sources for already-cracked versions online.I refuse to pay $50 for trying the game 3 times, putting virus-like software on my computer or simply supporting EA's draconian DRM policies and stupidity."
1,Poor,"Stay away from this game, very poor compatibility and DRM causes this disc to not work in many systems."
1,Say No to RootKits,"Seriously, there's no excuse for pushing a rootkit on unsuspecting users. and for the users that are AWARE of it, more likely than not you will push them to either:a) a decision to not buyb) an illegitimate (but ironically clean) copy of the productThe customer-hostile parameters of DRM is a ""cure"" that is far worse than the problem it attempts to address. I've waited for Spore for years, but absolutely refuse to open my doors to a rootkit for ANY product."
1,Will not purchase due to Digital Rights Management.,"I, too, was very excited for SPORE during its preview phase. I was worried that I would need to upgrade my computer in order to play it, but was pleasantly suprised to discover it has very forgiving minimal requirements. As such, I figured that I would purchase the game now, then upgrade my computer and bask in its wonders.Now, however, I discover that the DRM will only allow for 3 installs and creates hidden folders like malware. As I'm planning on upgrading, this would leave me 1 install for a future date. Even if EA were to increase the amount of installs, I can easily see myself surpassing ten installs if I upgrade in a piecemeal fashion.Additionally, I am saddened to discover that for all the promise of creative content creation, from creatures to clothes to crafts, it all amounts to completely cosmetic changes.DRM and shallow gameplay? I'll pass. If I were EA and Maxis, I'd start taking a hard look at Sims 3."
1,"Thanks, but no thanks","I was interested in this game the moment I heard about it. The interest disappeared the moment I heard about the draconian DRM. I've had enough of software companies treating paying customers like criminals while the ""criminals"" get a better running, less intrusive program.Enough already!"
1,Just say no to DRM,"Simply put, not going to buy or load this on my computer if the Draconian DRM is staying."
1,not for me,"I won't be paying $50 for a game that I can only install 3 times. I reimage my PC's about twice a year and have never heard of this kind of limitation. I'd purchase for $5, but not $50. This reminds me of how Sierra used to take over your PC when you installed a game."
1,DRM hold back a decent title.,"Like Bioshock poor DRM holds back a decent game. With the poor activation system the game is being rented to you rather than yours.Gameplay is decent, but nothing extra-ordinary or worth the intrusive DRM. The principle of EAs implementation leaves a bad taste in any consumers mouth."
1,DRM is a deal-breaker.,"I was planning on purchasing this game, but after reading the reviews and learning about the DRM issues, I decided to look for something else that won't put uninstallable spyware on my computer. In fact, I have been planning on replacing my computer within the next 6 months, and having to use up 2 out of 3 installs already just makes me question what the point of having this registration system is. I sincerely hope that EA will remove the DRM software from this product, but until that happens I highly doubt I will play this game."
1,Don't treat me like a theif,"I have been playing PC Games since DOS. I remember having to look up codes in the players handbook. I don't mind. I don't mind having an disc in the drawer. But limited install is not fair. I have music software that requires contacting the company when I reinstall it. But they have been sold. Now I am stuck. I will not buy Sony products. I buy games. I pay for them. Don't treat me like a thief.May I suggest any game from Stardock? They treat their customers well. I will wait on Spore, as hard as that will be, until they allow me to install the game as many times as I care to."
4,It was worth it.,"After reading all of the reviews good and bad, about the game and about the software I made the decision to buy it anyway. It was totally worth it. It is a fun game that takes hours upon hours away from your life, that is if you have hours to take away. It is is amusing as well as puzzeling. Either way I say it is 100% worth it to buy the game, this is if you want to get addicted."
3,Great game. It can get better.,"Love this game! It can be a such creative outlet. It is also many games within one game. As your creature evolves game play becomes more sophisticated. There is room for improvement though on the creator creator side. Spaceship shapes for example seem to already have a predetermined ""flight"" direction which limits you somewhat. I'm still a beginner though so there may be tricks I haven't picked up yet."
4,Spores Unite!,"I did not understand when I bought Spore how it interacted online. The creatures you create are taken as models and used to populate other people's worlds if you login to an account you've made on their servers, but you do not play directly with other players. A great game by itself, the multitude of ways one can mutate a creature is endlessly fascinating! The only thing that could possibly make it better is if you could truly take your creature and go play with your friend's creature online in real MMORPG fashion. Love it!"
1,DRM = Purchase protection,"I can personally verify that DRM has protected Spore from being purchased by me. I can tell you that I was looking forward to buying a copy of spore, I have been following it's development for almost two years now. But since of this DRM BS I won't, for now at least. I know I could get it DRM free on piratebay but I won't do that either. Maybe I'll buy it for $9.95 in a year or so."
1,EA deserves to go out of business.,"Not only did they saddle this game with some of the worst copy protection measures I've ever heard of, but their only response so far has been to insult people who don't like it.Wow, EA. Who do you think you are? Anyone who gives EA any money ever again is a masochist, because they'll just keep doing this stuff over and over again. Send a clear message to this backwards company. Put them out of business. Who needs them anyway?"
1,Oh spore....,"The game itself is fun, the creature creator is awesome, and its not too detailed so you can just jump in and play.I've been looking forward to this game for nearly 3 years. I pre-ordered it from amazon a long time ago. But then I canceled when news of the drm came out.To be fair, they've made the drm slightly more customer friendly since the announcement. But the showstopper is the 3-install limit. Think 3-installs/validations is plenty?1) you install the game on windows xp2) you upgrade to vista3) you upgrade your video card4) you upgrade when the new vista service pack comes out.BAM, 4 validations right there. Now you are on the phone praying for EA's mercy. Except they've already proven that they hate their own customers by having this system in first place.And the pirates? The don't have to deal with any of this.Spore is truly an achievement in software, a testament to an outstanding creative vision. DRM is precisely the opposite."
1,Don't want it.,"I have been a fan of Will Wright all the way from Sim City on Nintendo all the way up to The Sims and Sim City 4. The thing I like about all the games is replayability. Simply put, I still have my games back to Sim City 2000. I have installed it in countless computers (two have been stolen in the past year).I would never consider buying a game that keeps me from enjoying my own property unless I beg for another chance to play. DRM hurts paying customers. The pirates could care less, they know how to get around it, proving them with a much better product than those who actually do pay.I was excited about Spore. I have been following it's production since the beginning. I will not support this foolishness."
1,"I, sadly, will not be buying this game","I certainly planned to. I believe the idea behind the game is great. It is certainly unfair that a game with such potential is being shot down like this. It is just not worth it for me, no matter how good the game, to buy a product that could potentially infect my computer and that has a limited number of uses. I read this analogy in one of the discussion threads: its like a delicious sandwich covered in broken glass.Hopefully this large-scale response will turn some heads at EA. I'm not terrible hopeful. Sorry Wil."
1,DRM = Dirty Rotten Management,"I had every intention of buying this game, along with The Sims 3 next year, until I read about SecuRom. I am afraid to install this on my computer after hearing horror stories of the hardware problems the software causes, as well as my previous experience with Bioshock on the PC.I have amassed a large collection of PC games over the past ten years, and even as I've outgrown old computers and moved on to shinier, faster ones, my games have stayed with me. Spore, with its ""three installs"" rule, will render me unable to enjoy my games past a few years. I don't think I'll bite.EA, give me unlimited installs and no extra software that will disable my optical drives and antivirus programs. Until then, I won't waste my money or my time."
1,DRM Hurts Consumers,"Why would I spend $50 to rent this game that includes the virus that is DRM? I'd pay maybe $10, but even then, I don't want the virus running on my computer at all times.Too bad I'll have to skip this one. It looked like a decent game."
1,"Do Not Buy, DRM is awful","This DRM thing is just completly ridiculous, and stupid EA is doing nothing about...The least they can do is put on the box that the game comes with software that will harm the PC."
1,Garbage Day,"Game is garbage. Why pay to, as was pointed out above, rent a game. Pirates are able to play this game as long as they want, but those that actually purchase it are condemned to a restrictive access. As someone who formats and upgrades hardware a lot, this game would be a nightmare to play and install."
1,Why buy games at all?,"When it's easier to pirate a game than buy it legitimately, why would I buy it? How far do these companies think they can go before the Great Unwashed will say ""Enough!""?I will not hand over my hard-earned to rent a game, and be at the whim of EA."
1,"Too simple gameplay, too much DRM","Spore could have been fantastic, had the game been developed by someone else than Electronic Arts. They focus way too much on profit and way too little on gameplay. The game is just too simplistic and each level of the game is too short and shallow. I would love to see this game's underlying synthesizing engine explored in much more depth than what it currently does. I'm very disappointed in how it ended up.The game itself deserves 3 stars, but because of the draconian and user-hostile DRM it's bundled with, it deserves nothing more than 1 star. Had zero stars been an option, that's what I'd given it."
1,Families - do NOT buy this game,"I discovered after buying this game that only one account can be created. If you are in a household with a partner and/or children and you all want to play the game, you are forced to use the same log-in account, which basically means you're all playing the same game instead of playing your own games. The worst thing is that they never told anyone this was the case, and the game's user manual says you CAN have more than one account, but they changed their minds. On top of that, you can only install the game three times before it stops working. If you like to reinstall Windows now and then, then Spore will only work three times. It's disgusting behaviour by the publisher, Electronic Arts (EA). I will be taking my copy back for a refund."
1,Give them an inch . . .,"I, for one, thank the work done to discover and present the DRM issues before I got around to purchasing this game. As it is now, I will not buy it. As an owner of several computers (some more reliable than others) I could easily reach the 3 computer maximum. I am also not a very big fan of the account limitation either.EA is one of the largest game producers out there. If they feel that by adding this malware to your computer is a successful business model, than they will continue the process on future games... and while I may not be a fan of every EA game that comes out, there are some that I was looking forward to. However, I will not support a system where I have to ask for permission to play the game some time in the future... and I hope that others will follow that trend. Don't let this become a successful business model...DRM = paying the price for full ownership while obtaining a rental."
1,/agree,"Add my name to the list of people who would love to buy and play Spore, but cannot while such a DRM protects it from being an enjoyable experience.Remove the DRM and you can have my $$"
1,Don't pay $50 for a game rental,EA's DRM scheme will only let you install this game three times before it bricks. DO NOT BUY.
1,The DRM sucks,"I just wanted to buy this game, but after reading how the DRM works I have to say: not thank you EA!"
1,"DRM is Bull, plain and simple","I was about to buy this game, but after reading about the ridiculous DRM and 3 time activation I have happily cancelled my purchase. There is no way I'am going to be treated as a criminal by EA so they wont be getting my money. I reformat my computers regulary, and as this software can automatically detects hardware changes and forces another activation they would be used up in a very small amount of time. Then I would have to call EA with my recepts required to get another activation? After that your screwed! This is madness. This crappy DRM isnt stopping piracy, it's making it flourish in abundance. What do you think people are going to do after the 4th activation when EA refuses to give you a 5th activation even with your receipts ? Thats right !! Pirate it !!!"
1,DRM sucks!!!,Shame on EA... I had paid 50 bucks to RENT this game!!!!I could buy some other game for this much money... if EA wants to use DRM then they should charge game renting prices!!!EA you are out of my list... Blizzard is the only decent game company left.Blizzard do not disappoint me...
1,will not buy this based on the reviews,I considered buying this game but changed my mind after reading about the onerous DRM.
1,How great of a game this *Could* have been.,"This was on my list of being one of the best games of 2008. The DRM in this game is so pathetic I'm now trying to see if I can return the game and get a refund. Do not buy this game, it is BROKEN. If I wanted this kind of terrible software I'd be better off installing the Sony RootKit from one of their lame CDs."
1,DRM killed it. I chunked it.,"This is only the second game that I purchased that has SecuROM. I removed them both less than 24 hours after installation. BTW I had problems with both when attempting to install. Yes, my computer is very recent gen and has all the stuff needed to play current games. EA - you really stepped in a pile here. DO the right thing for your paying customers and fix this mess."
1,Great game for kids and stupid people.,"This game had tons of promise, unfortunately in order for EA to get it out the door they completely dumbed it down to the point where it's just not fun. I'll stick to Civ4 thanks."
1,DRM!!!,"DRM is a show stopper. I doubt this game will work for me after a few years given my habit of new hardware purchases and system snapshots. Like others have said, this game is for rent not sale."
2,sigh...what a disappointment,"This was not the game we saw in 2005. It had so much potential, as per the demo Will Wright showed us, but man, what a disappointment the game turned out to be.A waste of my $45."
1,"Buggy, boring and unplayable","I really was looking forward to this game and was hugely disappointed at the quality (it's very buggy) how simplistic it is and how un-fun it really is.It sounded like such a great idea but it's almost like the developers spent all their time trying to make this creature creator and forgot about substance entirely.Don't worry about the DRM, this game is so unplayable that one install should be enough.... better yet, don't bother shelling out the money for this dreck."
1,DRM kills video games,"This game could be one of the best of the year, but because of the DRM I would recommend not getting it until it's removed."
1,DOA Thanks to DRM,"If, or should I say, when, EA gets the message and removes the DRM virus delivered along with the game, I'd be happy to buy a copy."
1,"Interesting game, unfortunately crippled by DRM","Spore offers one of the more interesting gaming concepts in the last few years.Unfortunately, the game is marred by crippling copy protection that prevents legitimate owners of the game from easily playing it. Limited installs, online activation and drm that is incompatible with many normal programs you may already have installed on your PC.It's such a shame that the distributor of the game treats its own customers as criminals and attempts to do their best to prevent you from actually playing the game.Not recommended unless you really want to play the game and have the help of someone very techie to help you get past the inevitable problems created by the copy protection mechanism."
2,"Spore promises a lot, but it gets boring rather quick","The DRM issues aside, Spore is a fun game....for the first hour.After you have gotten through all there is to go through in one world the game gets rather repetitive. The choices aren't near as in depth as one would hope them to be either. The only real customizable thing in the game is the creatures, buildings, and vehicles. Actual game play is always the same...befriend or destroy other people."
1,SAY NO TO DRM,"EA has pushed it too far with their DRM on this game, you never own this game its as if you are just renting it from them.I was really excited about this product, but refuse to buy it with their DRM."
2,The game is boring.,"Even if you don't care about or don't understand the awful DRM issues, there's one more thing you should know:This game is rather boring.It plays like a dumbed-down version of several other games all strung together.The game does look fantastic for it's graphics. The concept of playing in a universe populated by creations of other people playing the game is certainly unique, and what made me interested in the first place. All the different creature-creation tools are fun to play with. However, all these mean nothing if the game itself is dull. There's nothing in the game itself that is ""compelling"", that is, makes we want to continue playing."
1,boycott EA games & DRM,NO DRM!! LIMITATION TO ONLY 3 ACTIVATIONS FOR YOUR PAID GAMES?? NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!
1,Ok game with a horrible DRM-Securom scheme.,This is a playable game but lost its audience with its DRM scheme. I had to help a friend delete the Securom application off of his computer which was a pain in the ***. The piracy number stands close to 2 million last time I checked.I would recommend no one buy this game. Its worth downloading it coz there's no malware or lock.
2,I bought it. It was fun... To a point...,"Ok, I'll start out saying that I didn't know about the DRM until after I'd even played the game. It bugs me, but I'll live with it.The game play itself is fun to a point. The first time through it's really cool learning all the different nuances to the different stages of evolution (my favorite being the creature stage). Play it again and you'll feel like an old hand at a decent game. The next time through... not so much. The lack of options (in a game hyped for unlimited options) is a real replay killer. That's how it goes for me. Every time I try it out, I find that it's lacking a great deal. The tribal and civilization games feel like they were thrown together too fast, or with an expensive expansion in mind.I'd say the game is alright, but it lacks replay-ability and has some horrible software consequences for the buyer.I suggest waiting for the price to drop, a new version, or buying at your own risk/annoyance."
1,Great Game - Stupid DRM,"I almost never post reviews of my purchases, but felt obligated to support the general outcry against the DRM implementation associated with this game.Summary: Great game 4+ Stars - Stupid DRM -3 stars = 1 starI thing the game is terrific and have been having a blast. Moreover, I think it has huge potential. Sadly, the decision to use a form of DRM that limits the number of installations is unacceptable. I am a software developer and hardware junkie. I break, rebuild, and/or modify my machine on a monthly basis. To avoid (hopefully) DRM issues, I decided to install spore on an external drive in hopes of limiting the impact of my system tinkering. Still - stupid that I would need to go to such measures just so I can be sure to still have the game I paid $[...] for 3 rebuilds from now...If I do end up getting locked out and my game deactivated, I will likely grab a hacked copy which are everywhere. Sad since this was a game that I happily paid for and was eager to support."
2,Very disappointed,"This game falls far short of expectations. The best part of the game is the creature creator, which you can download for free. The game is split into 5 stages. The first 4 stages are fun, but don't offer much challenge, don't take very long to complete, and don't offer much replayablility. The final stage (the spage stage) is obnoxious through and through. The final stage is very frustrating, and when its not frustrating, its repetitive and boring.I believed the hype. When the creator of The Sims says that they are coming out with a revolutionary Sim everything game, I believe it, but sadly it is not so. Compared to The Sims, this game doesn't rate well at all. I only wish their was a way to get my money back.I, personally, don't have an issue with the DRM. But I do have an issue with how this game was marketed. I feel duped and I wont be buying any EA titles or Will Wright games."
2,Forget the DRM protests -- I have a real problem to warn you about.,"First of all, let me start by saying this is a great, *great* game. Very fun and highly addictive. The game itself is everything you probably hoped it would be.Here's the warning, though: it better work right out of the box for you. Because if there's any technical problem or you can't connect to the vast online community through the game, you're screwed. EA's Technical Support team -- if you could call them that -- finally got back to me with a request for more information AFTER EIGHT DAYS!!!!!! At this point I may be able to start using online-created characters sometime in 2012.So if you want the game, buy it. If it works 100% for you out of the box, have a ball. If it doesn't, return the game *immediately* and save yourself the grief of having to work with EA to fix any issues. Because they most definitely will not help you."
1,0 Use DRM,"I had wanted to buy this game, but not now. I play some games for years. I still play Age of Empires Rise of Rome. I want to OWN the game if I pay $50. I can understand registering for online content. I will not register on line to play a game at home. I do not expect the online activation to work even 5 years from now. Remember ""Plays for Sure""? Now it plays nothing.So EA gets the ultimate DRM. I don't have the game and need 0 activations. Lost customers are the best DRM, they can't do anything with your product.Perhaps in a few years EA will release a gold edition that does not require me to beg EA to play the game. I'll buy that."
1,DRM kills all,"If it wasn't for the DRM I would give it high scores. However, it is asking to much to have only 3 installs. I would wait until EA gets it through their thick heads to remove the install limits before buying it."
1,DRM? . . .Really?,What the heck? THREE computers? Are you serious? I really really wish I could return this game :(
1,Another lost customer.,I really would've like to play this game but EA decided to add SecuROM and as much as I like to get reamed by big corporations and spend an hour on the phone to reactivate my game every two months I think I'll pass.
1,DRM is a Deal Killer,"EA has recently been attempting to change its image in the gaming community from a project-killing developer sweat shop to something more positive -- but this happening to what it surely expected to be a video game blockbuster is doing it no favors. - The RegisterThat sentence above about sums it up. DRM has been bad in the past (if you scratch a CD you cannot install the game, and you can't backup the CD) but this takes it to new levels. You can only install this game three times. Ever. Have a laptop? A computer for the kids? Plus your own? You've used up your installs. What if you need to reformat your hard drive and reinstall? Can't because you are out of installs."
1,About to buy it,"i was about to buy it when i read all that about the drm glad i didn't. I won't install any game in my computer that contains any DRM, ever!"
1,Consumers should not purchase because of DRM.,"After seeing the advertisement for this game, I was excited to buy it, unaware of the DRM. After reading about the nature of the DRM, I will not buy this game and I will tell all my friends not to buy it. Essentially, this purchase would be a $50 rental, which is consumer exploitation."
1,"DRM Didn't Fix the Piracy ""Problem""","Seriously, EA, give it up. Get rid of the DRM so everyone can enjoy the game they supposedly own. The game was leaked early despite all the precautions so they obviously don't work, they just make nice people who pay for the game really pay for it in headaches."
1,DRM Killed It...,"I purchased the game yesterday, and after moving it to my home computer after work, and putting it on my laptop to take to Taiwan with me next week, I have hit the limit allowed by DRM. Do these people even have a clue?The people who are trying to pirate the game have already done so! It's people like me, who actually pay for the damned games that get screwed. But, I guess I'll get used to it. I just lost 80% of my Freddie Mac stock too, because of all the losers out there that can't play by the rules!In the end, I recommend sending these publishers a message. 1 star reviews for DRM games."
1,Spore,Spore is a great game but DRM really contricts you to one computer. My brother wanted to play it but we couldn't install it on the family pc
1,They'll get get my money when they lose the overdone DRM,"Sorry but the DRM is getting out of hand. It seems publishers will only learn when they see how much it cuts into their bottom line. My kids love the Sim series of games but they won't be playing Spore anytime soon thanks to the DRM. I regularly rebuild our systems from scratch to keep them running well (and clear out the clutter my kids pick up). If 3 activations is all I get then I'm not going to spend the money, no matter how good the game."
1,Not what I expected,I had high expectations for this title until I found the DRM sucked up resources on older systems. Hopefully the next version will correct these problems.
1,The DRM will cost you money,It has messed with my machine and I will soon be forced to buy a new Spore because their 3 install limit and my system wipes and hardware upgrades. Thanks for coming through for us ea...
1,Not Purchasing Because of DRM,"I couldn't wait to buy this game, but now I'm going to. The DRM is reprehensible and I will not purchase until it is gone."
1,Such a Shame,"I'm very disappointed that EA has chosen to treat us all like criminals. I've always enjoyed Will Wrights games, and have been looking forward to Spore for years. I am not a criminal, and I refuse to pirate these games, so there is unfortunately no way I can play this game. Well, atleast the criminals who are willing to pirate it will be able to play unhindered, good thinking EA! I'm angry that I've spent several hundred dollars with EA in the past, and this is how they treat me. I will not do business with them again until these issues are resolved."
1,Spore as fun as watching paint dry,"Wow, I can't believe I bought this, was a pile of trash. Will Wright can save his snarky comments about his game - maybe if he saves them up he can post them on the walls of his new cardboard box to remind him of the epic failure that is Spore.I went from the beginning of the game to the end in like 6 hours...none of it was really interesting - and for something so long in development it makes me wonder if the creators didn't just drink and play hackey sack all day instead of working on this. It's like a 10 year old made the game and then the EA staff put flashy graphics on it. DUMB.Enjoy my $50, the next time you come out with something that 'might' interest me, i'll wait 3+ months to see if it's a steaming pile like this one is.Thanks for nothing."
1,EA and DRM sucks,EA has ruined an otherwise fair title with their DRM. EA will not get any more of my business until they end their use of DRM. They punish honest gamers and customers by trying (and failing) to keep people from pirating their games. As a direct result Spore will be one of the most pirated games ever. Well done EA.
3,Fun until you reach the Space Age,"Putting aside from all the negative reviews of the ""DRM problem"" with Spore, Spore is overall a fun game.The precise problem comes with the Space Age, where you have to actually do work and never be caught cheating or you'll get the Joker Badge. You can still bypass this problem with deleting that save game and start a new one from the beginning."
1,Spore good?,"Spore ROCKS.... DRM sucks....its not worth it.... bust out you game boy and wait this out. EA failed us. don't buy this game, its not ok."
1,DRM has ruined another Interwebbers perspective,These comments are fantastic. I will not only not buy or play the game. I will tell everyone I know that plays games not to get it. It's good to know the game sucks too.
1,EA is great. DRM is not.,EA is great company. No doubt about it. The DRM technology they are using though is a separate matter. And hence the 1 star.
1,The EA DRM is a purchase killer,"Like many others who've posted reviews of Spore, I will not pay good money to effectively rent a game from EA. When I buy something, that means I own it, and EA doesn't seem to get that simple principle. I'll wait until the DRM is removed, and only then will I consider purchasing this game.Also, I've watched friends playing this game, and the playability for the earlier phases of the game seems very weak. My purchase will be waiting on either a significant playability upgrade or a price of less than $20."
1,DRM is a show stopper,"DRM is keeping me from installing this game. My friends have told me how much fun this game is, but I will not buy it because I am unwilling to have the game install its spyware-like DRM system. Like others have said, this game is for rent not sale.I do not and can not support DRM. Do not want."
1,Creature Creator is like Renting a Barbie-Doll,"When I buy something, I expect it to continue working, despite upgrading my computer. Well, sadly this is not the case with SPORE, as it will only allow you to activate the game 3 times (forever) on your computer.Most games I have bought, include a serial number printed on the disk, which will allow me to reinstall the product; however many times I want, withing worrying about it failing to work.Super lame."
1,Spore is all hype save your money,For $50 you only get to install it three times then ownership returns to EA. The game play is very boring. This game is all hype.
1,DRM makes it hard to rent this game,"I would've liked to try this one out, but due to the DRM restrictions, I won't buy it.I refuse to rent a game for $50; that's way more expensive than anything else I'd rent for entertainment.I am a great fan of this genre, I bought copies of all the simcity's, civilization's, * Tycoons, etc. I even have a copy (paid for!) of Populous I and II! But a game that I can't re-install when I want it to, no, thanks, I'll pass.I would buy it if it didn't have the DRM."
4,Good but not Great,The game is engaging but too simple. The controls lack depth and there is a limitation on the way you can do things. Also the game is linear in the way it approaches gameplay. Overall it is very addicting.
3,"Good game, DRM cost it a star...","...but it's still a good game. It comes down to this. If you have room in your entertainment budget for both fun mindless ""fluff"" games AND hardcore strategic mind exercises, then buy Spore. It will satisfy the fluff. Then play Civ or MOO or something else for your strategy itch. Spore is completely light-weight, but it's gorgeous and fun, and if you play it for a couple of weeks you've probably got your money's worth. Hell, you might even love it, some folks do. DRM is a bummer, but there are far worse things in the world to get bent out of shape about.Oh, and to those spamming ""draconian""...a thesaurus is a wonderful thing. I know it's a cool word, and it sounds kinda like ""dragon""...RAWR...but it's starting to sound like a 3rd grade class that just learned a new word here."
1,"Forget the DRM, SPORE is a mash-up of free games","This game has interesting artwork but it really is not very accurate to call this a game...calling it a toybox is about right...overall it provided me of about 5 hours of time-wasting style gameplay that i usually get from free flash game sites....i am VERY disappointed at having to pay 50 bucks for this ""game""."
1,DRM has ruined this game.,The DRM included with this game has ruined it. Avoid at all costs. I do not understand why game companies punish their customers with these awful DRM schemes that do not work. There are pirated copies of this game circulating the internet (minus the DRM). The only people that this DRM is hurting are the ones that actually purchase the game. DRM is useless because it is always cracked by the pirates. This is another DRM laden game to avoid.
1,"Love the game, Hate the Publisher","ONLY 3 INSTALLS?! And forget it if their license server should go down, which it it has already done. Wait for the DRM to be removed, it only hurts honest customers.I'm not even getting into EA's entire approach to user management. If you do anything even a little bit unorthodox you're in for a couple of days of frustration and your product is diminished."
1,SecuROM is a dealbreaker,"I have waited for the release of this game for years, only to discover that Electronic Arts has saddled it with SecuROM and a 3-installation limit. It is a shame that EA could not give this game and its customers a proper treatment."
2,Could've been great...,"This game could have been a great thing. The leaks and tidbits of information given while it was in development made it out to be something that it isn't. It's basically just another simulation clone (Sim, Age of Empires, Tycoon games), though this time in ""bubbly"" 3D and with the genetic ""theme"". Fun for approx. 2 hours... that's it."
1,Won't be buying this after all,"I honestly came here with the intent to purchase this game. Thanks to all the Amazon customers who raised the red flag on the DRM software. I will never purchase another product with DRM software on it. I've dealt with it in the past, and it ruined two new PCs. We had to wipe both of them and reload everything to get them running again.Unless you are very PC savy, and know what you are getting yourself into, I would recommend that you avoid any games with DRM software on them. It just isn't worth it.I did download the trial creature creator, and while I did enjoy playing with it, I got the impression that the final product has been watered down from the original vision. It's probably not a bad game, but even without the DRM and activation issues, I doubt it is the great game everyone expected."
1,Pirates offer a better deal,"Wait until its pirated, they'll offer a better deal to those that choose to pirate the game - no activations, no unusable software after reinstalling your OS."
1,Another lost sale due to DRM.,"I intended to purchase, then learned of the obnoxious DRM. Count me as another lost sale. How's that DRM working out for you there?"
1,Would be fun if I could actually play,"The game played well and was fun for the first two days. I made it through the first 2 out of 5 stages. The graphics were great and the game ran smoothly on my my machine. It was a little too simple (not very replayable), but I've heard the later stages are much better. Unfortunately, I can't play them since the official patch makes the game completely unplayable; EA/MAXIS has known about the issues everyone is having for over a week but haven't bothered to fix them. The game is worthless if it can't be played."
2,Biggest Gaming Letdown in a long time,"Obviously, everybody was looking forward to Spore. For me, at least, it has turned out to be a huge letdown. Although the absolutely rediculous DRM restrictions are appalling, that is not why I'm rating it so low. The Mac Cider of this port is so horrible that I'm unable to play the game for more than 5 minutes on my Mac Pro without an unrecoverable system crash, and even when it does run the performance is unacceptable.Performance aside, the gameplay is not very engrossing and so simplified that I have trouble understanding how the game took so long to complete. The first three stages especially are unbelievably shallow. Each tries to embody a different genre of game, and each represents a very poor example of that genre.Maybe the game was overhyped, and was bound to be disappointing. Even so, I feel that everyone involved in the game's development (especially EA) has missed a huge opportunity."
1,"Not one to ""buy"" this game","If i wanted to get held up and mugged when renting games, I'd go to blockbuster. Also, adding 12 legs to a creature seems inefficient, and more likely to put them on the evolutionary chopping block; but in Spore, adding random apendages makes no real difference."
1,SecuROM. DRM. Fail.,A product you pay for that restricts the number of times you can install it. 1 star.
1,DRM,It installs a program that WILL NEVER UNINSTALL from your computer. It will only install 3 times. Who pays 50 bucks for somthing that installs 3 times. Break your computer thats one lend it to your sis thats two your hard drive randomly fails thats three and yo lose $50
2,DRM aside,"DRM aside, the game still isn't really all that great. The cell phase is the only phase that is actually fun to play. All of the other phases limit what you can do and are extremely repetitive. There's very little to look forward to as you advance through the stages, and the space stage is so bogged down by pirates and enemies that you really spend most of your time defending you and your allies instead of actually exploring. The game just isn't good."
1,DRM says it all,"I was really excited about Spore. I was ready to run out and buy it on the day of release, until I found out about the DRM. Unless removed I will not buy it, and I will not buy any other Game EA puts out until they get rid of this rediculas policy, it has obviously not stoped the piracy of thier game, but rather punishes the folks who want to buy thier game legitimately."
1,Overly simplistic gameplay,"Unfortunately, the gameplay in Spore is a little too basic for us hardcore gamers. Also, what's up with renting the game? As soon as it's no longer profitable for EA to maintain license servers, it's their obligation to shareholders to shut them down. From that time forth, noone will ever be able to reinstall Spore legally. So much for the nostalgic joy of firing up an old game decades later, long after the publisher has gone under!"
1,The DRM is really bad,I really think EA have made a big mistake here. The DRM is far too restrictive and I hope that they will lift the restrictions in a future patch.
2,"Its ok, maybe worthwhile","I had really high hopes for this game after seeing presentation video from TED by Will Wright. Right before it came out, my expectations dropped a little. And that seems fair. The game is interesting, and fun, but it gets somewhat repetitive. The editors are good, but its too bad that only the stats of the creature really matter, and not the aesthetics. Its a fun game overall, but not that deep. I can see how it would be a great introduction to gaming though, for people that aren't gamers.I am worried about the DRM though. It seems more restrictive than it needs to be. Installing it only 3 times reduces its longevity, and means I won't likely be able to pick it up in a few years and install it on whatever computer I have then. I would give it another star if it didn't have this. I very much thought about not buying it. And I probably will only buy non-DRM games for a while."
1,Piracy - the problem and the solution!,"If you've read any of the other reviews you know what the major problem with this game is. My recomendation is to get a pirated copy of the game. The very thing they were trying to stop by ruining their game is the very solution to the problem.Don't pay for this game. Punish them for what they've done to honest paying gamers by witholding the thing they want the most, your money."
1,DRM is an abomination,It's ludicrous that the paying customers are the ones suffering while the pirates got the game before it was released. Publishers like EA need to rethink their schemes.
1,Piece of JUNK,Don't buy this game.Down with EA and their DRM. You will be unable to reinstall it if you have to reformat your pc or buy a new one. Have 2 pcs? You better buy 2 copies.
1,DRM Enough Said!,DRM... EA you guys are dreaming that I would pay $49.99 to load Spore in my system.
1,The DRM treats all customers as criminals,"The game is mildly fun...and doesn't really get started until the Space age.I went through the same DRM with Mass Effect...I'm on my 5th install of that game...I have to call EA every time I want to install the game. That is ridiculous...especially since anyone can download a crack to get around it. The DRM does nothing...NOT A SINGLE THING...to hurt ANY form of piracy (including friends sharing the game, since it's so easy to get a crack for it). The only purpose is to hurt customers who play by the rules...treating them as if they were criminals. I am so glad this kind of anti-DRM push is finally going on. EA needs to get the message that this kind of DRM and any DRM that HURTS THE CUSTOMERS is not the answer."
1,Shove your DRM,If I buy a game I expect to be able to reinstall it as many times as I need to - without being forced to jump through hoops by the publisher to do so. I do not want EA's rootkit DRM trojan installed on my PC as part of that process.
1,Don't buy SW crippled with DRM,"I never buy/use/recommend software that's loaded with crippling DRM. Toss your $50 in the fireplace, it'll save you the shipping charge."
1,Very disappointed!,"Expected this game to be AWESOME, but it was far from it. Creature creation is fun, but the rest of the game is really lame. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,A simple explanation,"Dear EA, and other game publishers using draconian DRM:Consider the matrix of pirates/non-pirates and games with/without DRM.- Pirate, game without DRM: steals game.- Pirate, game with DRM: steals cracked game.- Non-pirate, game without DRM: pays for game.- Non-pirate, game with DRM: frustrated by ridiculous activation limits/failures and SecureRom crippleware, insulted by being treated like a criminal. Does not buy game."
1,AN AWFUL WAIST OF MONEY,"I bought this game about four days after it was released, and excitedley brought it home. I install it and try to play only to have it constantly stutter and freeze during gameplay. I call EA and talk to person after person who really had no idea what they were doing. Finally after a week of frustration I find out that my video card is not compatible with the game. how can that be with my one year old computer I ask? they had no answers. So I had to pay to ship the game and the reciept to texas and after a month they still have it. All this work just to return a game that really wasnt even that interesting to play, pretty basic and pointless. The best part were the graphics and evolution options which i learned had no purpose. This game is an overall failure. Dont waist your money."
2,Good intention but poor execution,"This is an innovative idea that just wasn't finished. To me it seems like they are planning to release this game as a skeleton to flesh out in future releases, but who wants to buy an incomplete game. The space stage is fun, and seems to be where they spent most of their time, but the other stages are short and relatively pointless. My guess is they will release expansions for us to buy to flesh out those other areas.If you are a designer and have good imagination, you will love this game, otherwise, play at a friends house.The game is also filled with bugs. Installations, DRM, random crashes, Spore has them all. If this were released on a console it would have been laughed out of the market, but since its PC they seem to think its ok to release a game that is 80% or less. Look up spore bugs and you will see what I'm talking about.If you are planning on buying this game, wait a few months, till they come out with some updates to make the game actually function."
1,Need to finish the game!,It's like thay where on to something then someone told them to wrap it up realy fast and sell it the entire *game* (if it darded to be called so) Is nothing more then cariter creation. Thay got to the part when thay where ment to do something with what you made then just gave up. It realy could have bin a masterfull game IF thay had made it so you could do something intresting when you where done creating you're alien.:P I give it a 12% outa 100. Great base but nothing els realy.
1,DRM=BAD,"I like the game. It is fun and encourages creativity, however I would never have bought it if I knew it could only be installed 3 times."
1,DRM IS NEVER FUN,"As a gamer I have purchased my last game encumbered with onerous drm. Stop treating customers like criminals. Until the drm is removed, I will not be buying Spore."
1,DRM = BAD.,"I have no internet at home. This kills me slowly, yes, but also it kills ALL CHANCES of having this game...Say it requires me to phone in?F that. No way. I am from the internet...Anonyminity is KEY... except apparently here.Say I want to install this on my home LAN for my GF to play...NOT GOING TO WORK.I buy ONE game for console multi, I should expect the same from PCs to stay competitive."
1,Guilty until proven innocent,"I am sick of this industry shift towards EA continuing to create inferior gaming experiences and then punishing paying customers with obscene DRM. I don't know if the game is any good, but I can guarantee I won't find out as long as this continues. Is it just me or is the DRM more advanced than the experience it is protecting? Spend more time building a decent product and less time trying to figure out how to protect your junk."
1,Not Buying Until Intrusive DRM is Removed,"I downloaded the creature creator but did not install it due to the immense EULA.I was really looking forward to Spore, but I will not support the intrusive DRM. I have been bitten by Sony rootkits before (non-working CD ROM) and by buying software, I do NOT consider myself to be giving consent for that software to own my machine.I'll buy Spore when the DRM is removed."
1,Only one account per game is ridiculous!,"If you have more than one family member or housemate, you must all use the same login. And same save file. And share your creatures. And share your achievements. It's totally ridiculous - there is no way for you to log in with more than one account. The game is tied to one login, and one login only. That's simply not acceptable."
1,"Draconian DRM, NO THANKS!","I'm a video game collector. If I had limited activations on my favorite games I've had for years such as Fallout 1&1, Planescape Torment, or Baldur's Gate just to name a few, my collection would be useless 5 times over by now. Over the years I've installed and re-installed games in my collection on various laptops and computers. Limited activations are a complete ripoff. This is like piracy of legitimate consumers and collectors."
1,boring,"its basically a very boring game. add/change/lengthen/shorten/widen the legs,feet,face,eyes etc and then off u go and hunt and procreate and build a village and enlarge it and bring war/diplomacy to other villages/cities and then conquer the entire world and then the whole universe --- equals boring"
1,Why SecuROM?,"I like the game, but the 3 activation limit is really a pain as I have more than 3 computers I could play on at any given time. Hopefully a patch will be made available to remove this activation limit or increase it. I do like the fact that the CD isn't required to play, but Stardock also has this feature without using any copy protection whatsoever. My Sins of a Solar Empire requires a simple one-time activation with the provided CD-Key to receive updates and patches, otherwise it's still playable. This is the way companies should release their games. Stardock FTW!"
3,"Well, Hmm.","Well, after the long wait, countless web videos, and a huge build up, I would have to say I am slightly disappointed. The concept could have been worked out much better, the graphics are to a standard that even I could manage to spit out, and I have already made it crash a few times tinkering in build mode. I found the transition from the Creature Creator, which was previously released, to the actual game annoying. I was forced to uninstall the creator prior game installation. Once in game I discovered the ability levels were different from that of the Creator. It has potential, but I am seriously hoping they come up with some serious updates. Over all it is ""cute."" Cute enough I think my 10 year old nephew would enjoy this far more then me."
1,At least 2 person account would be great,This is ridiculous I would not mind if the game had one user online account. After buying the game I thought I would be able to share this game w/ my brother since we pitch in to buy it and there you go on f**** user nice.
1,"DRM: Thanks, but no thanks.","I *really* want to play this game, but the DRM implementation is just not something I can support. This also applies to games like Mass Effect and BioShock. It pains me not to buy and play these games and support the developers, but the draconian copy protection is beyond reasonable."
1,SecureROM is not user-friendly!,"Were this advertised as a game-rental for some number of years, I would be ok with that. I was ready to *buy* a brand new computer capaible of playing spore. But with the DRM as-advertised? Nope. I'm not willing to do it.I suppose my rating has less value because I haven't yet played the game. But frankly, EA's draconian measures are keeping me from doing so.EA: I love your games! I *want* to pay you money to play them. I am willing to pay *more* to play games like Spore, that are so amazingly open ended. But I'm not ok with the privacy and ownership issues implied by your DRM. Please re-consider your business practices. I'm not willing to play a pirated version of this game to avoid the DRM. I'm sorry."
5,Great game - ignore the pirates who are rating it down.,"Many of the reviews are written by pirates who are rating the game down because it's hard for them to steal. Many of them are being written by people who never bought the game, nor will buy it, because they don't like DRM.It's hard, but try to ignore the idiots. Spore is a lot of fun - it's a modern take on an old classic. It keeps you coming back for more! I too don't like the DRM and would rather it was gone. But the game itself is really good."
4,Spore is a very fun game!,"Ok, Not sure what all the whinning is about concerning DRM, I installed the game and play the game....you all are freaking out about nothing!!The game itself is alot of fun, I agree the gameplay is very simplistic but the game is indeed addicting. I've very much enjoyed playing this and do recommend it to others."
5,Calm down and stop complaining,"Basically, I think this game is a 4-4.5 rating, I gave it a 5 because of all the incessant complaining that's going on here. It is a load of crap that you can only install the game 3 times before having to call in, but come on. The overall rating for this game is 1 star, and if anyone sits and asks themselves seriously, it's much better than that. This game is incredible on many levels and everyone on here is complaining and stomping their feet because they don't want to have to deal with the DRM. I personally HATE DRM but give the game some credit..."
1,Will infect your computer with a VIRUS. DO NOT BUY!,"DO NOT BUY this product under any circumstances. It will infect your computer with the SecuROM virus. SecuROM is a form of copy protection that sits in the background of your computer and will interfere with EVERYTHING - speed, surfing, working, games, etc. The only way to remove SecuROM is to reformat your computer.DO NOT BUY!"
1,Won't buy it because of DRM,"Thanks to everyone who warned us about the DRM in this game. I'm interested in the game, but not interested enough to break my computer to play it."
1,Buyer beware,"After installing spore, I was surprised to find that I can only install the application three times. I am a software developer so I quite often have windows issues that require I reinstall the operating system. Further, I like to swap between my desktop and my laptop to play games. This really sucks EA! If they would allow me a refund I would use it!!! Oh, the game play is a little dissapointing and a little to easy to beat. To much empahasis on design and not enough on actual gameplay..."
1,This won't stop the pirates,"Don't punish people who payed for the game with this BS, it will not stop the pirates, it will just punish the honest people."
1,"Great Idea, DRM killed it for me","I really would have loved to buy this game, but I don't rent. Sorry EA. You lost a sale because I don't rent my video games."
1,I Can't Even Get It To Install,"I've just spent the last 45 minutes using LogMeIn remote Control of my home computer from my office computer because my kids couldn't get the install of Spore to work. (And they are usually pretty tech savvy !!!) I figured I'd just pop on the computer remotely and figure it out.But, no matter how much I try, I just can't figure it out. Something is just leading to the install just disappearing, even after I entered the silly registration code. It just hangs. I can only believe it is due to this crazy DRM scheme.I am returning the game to Amazon tomorrow."
1,You might not even get to play it!,"I purchased Spore directly from EA on Sunday night when it was released, and have yet to even install it because EA forces you to install their ""EA Download Manager"" first, which won't install on my machine (Vista Home Premium). So I am here, 2 days later, no response from EA support to my open tickets, not able to even install the game that I paid for. I've opened a paypal dispute against EA/DigitalRiver but I doubt I am going to get my money back. Looks like EA made an easy $50 off me, but I promise you EA, it will be your last."
1,So glad I checked the reviews first...,"Wow, I just want to thank all the people who bothered to post reviews here. I was very interested in this game until I read the truth about the ridiculously restrictive DRM scheme that is included. I personally don't want a process that I can't remove to run on my system constantly just so I can install Spore. 3 activations is a joke, too. Thanks again all. I won't be trying Spore until a version without this DRM is released."
1,I feel sorry for the developers,"I have to say that I feel really sorry for the developers to have put years of great work into this game only to have EA ruin it with such awful DRM.To the Developers: Great work on developing such an original game!To the publishers: What makes you think that hurting paying customers is a good business practice?5 stars to the developers, 0 stars to the publishers."
1,Hmmmm....,"Not a good game for the amount of time it took to come out. I also regret purchasing it b/c of the DRM they included to combat ""piracy"". As a result, I think I will not be purchasing anything from Amazon or EA again until changes are made. EA, lay off the DRM crap, you guys are killing PC gaming. Amazon, don't censor or delete reviews, if the game is not enjoyable due to ANY reason, it is the consumer's right to know."
1,How can they not realize?,"When are these companies going to realize that things like this only hurts the paying customers? I truly don't understand what their reasoning is. The game is already cracked and DRM free for those who don't want to pay while we, the ones who actually want to pay for our software, are left with this kind of crapNo, I won't buy this. The only way I will ever play this is if I download it. That way I won't have to worry about intrusive copy ""protections""."
1,DRM!,"The ability of EA to arbitrarily decide how a user can use software on her own computer, and to make a part of her own computer off-limits so that it can spy on her in order to make sure that she abides by their restrictions is ludicrous."
1,NO DRM,"This game is amazing in concept... but EA had to go and screw everything up. I will not purchase this game. I will not support this game, and I will definitely not support EA, or anything EA produces.DRM is unacceptable. EA, I really hope you learn your lesson from all of this."
1,Don't rent this game.,"What they don't advertise on the box is that you can only install this game 3 times. Ever. Unless you grovel to their support line and get treated like a criminal.The idea is very original, but the gameplay is mediocre. If you really want to play it, download a torrent or something. Don't support EA putting this kind of draconian DRM on their products."
1,Treats me like a criminal,"I would LOVE this game if it didn't mess with my system. Tried to run it on my PC, but it disabled my DVD burner and now I must mess with the registry to get Nero to work. Tried to run it on my Macbook, but it doesn't work with the onboard video card. I can't sell it because it has a limited number of installs. Don't blow your money on broken garbage!"
1,SPOREntal,Games like this make me want to give up on the pc platform. I am a system builder and am constantly changing motherboards. Their is no way I am paying for this more than once. Shame on you EA!
1,EA punishing lawful purchasers,"I should have just downloaded this illegally, the DRM is so bad. If I purchase a game, I expect to OWN it in perpetuity. I'm sorry, but three installs is not a reasonable limit. My household has three computers, so EA feels that at this point I'll need special permission for a re-install on any one machine?Thanks but no thanks, EA. You can keep your Spore."
1,Cancelled pre-order,"I canceled my pre-order when I found out about the 3 install limit. I wipe my system every six months; I refuse to be forced to call EA and beg for another install for a product I PAID FOR. Yeah, that's not going to get old. At least give an install back when the program is uninstalled by a user. This DRM is onerous and I will not support it by buying this game."
1,I was going to buy this title,"But I don't like being punished for honestly purchasing games. First NWN2 installs what is basically a root kit and now I'm limited on installs. Someday they will learn to stop discouraging people from actually paying for games, music, DVDs etc."
1,DRM Disaster,"Game looks fun but I won't be getting it since I don't rent games. I buy games and well, after looking at the DRM disaster (3 installs total) that is following this game is shameful. I understand that companies want to protect their product but this method makes me wonder if I will ever by a game from EA again. Already, I know I won't be getting Red Alert 3, a series I have purchased every single game in. That game's DRM is almost as bad as Spore's.It is a shame since I have been looking forward to this game for years. Now because I'm going to be renting the game instead of owning, I will pass."
2,OK game but not great (ignoring DRM issues),"I've been waiting for this game for a long time, and am quite disappointed by it. The first four stages are fast and have very little replay value, unlike SimCity, Civilization, and related games that I could play many times, exploring different strategies. It's quirky, cute, and the audio and visuals are beautiful, but the underlying game dynamics aren't all that interesting.The final stage seems fun until you realize that all the missions are the same type of thing (fly to a planet, zap yellow glowing creatures, find some artifact, abduct some lifeforms, kill some pirates, and that's about it). I understand that there's supposed to be a grand finale at the end, but I'm not going to do the same thing over and over again for days to get there."
1,DRM spoils what could be a great game,"The title says it all: EA's draconian DRM spoils the game. I want the ability to reinstall Windows without buying another copy. I want to play without feeding in the CD. In short, I want games without SecuROM activation or CD checks. If you absolutely must use DRM, take a hint from Valve and their Steam content delivery system. Yes, it locks content to one account and requires Internet access, but you can download their games anywhere and it doesn't require further activation or CD checks. This system is actually useful, not restrictive to the user, and accomplishes the same end result.EA, take note: locking down users without a trade-off benefit will only end in failure."
1,Trash,"Over hyped and under delivered.It was a major underwhelming to play the game. Each stage is dumbed down, and space stage is boring.Use your money somewhere else.Not to mention, it is riddled with drm, and you have limited installs.I'd recommend you download it from a bittorrent site."
1,needs moar DRM,"I love the drm on this game!!! If I could have bought just the drm on its own, I would have given it a 5 star review. The ""game"" just gets in the way of my drm-induced happiness. Long live DRM!! Viva DRM !!!"
1,Virus/Spyware laden software,"This game installed virus/spyware ""DRM"" software on my computer WITHOUT MY PERMISSION that has slowed down my entire system significantly. The same thing happened to three other people I know who purchased this game. My recommendation: Avoid Spore at all costs, unless you want your computer's speed and performance severely slowed, even when the game isn't playing."
1,DRM = NO SALE!,"I've never been so happy an item was on backorder. I originally purchased the galactic edition from Best Buy but because I got an email saying it was on backorder I came here to buy the same thing. I'm glad I did. 3 installs is rediculous. I have a Diablo II CD that I've installed on probably 10 different computers. This could be the best game ever made but because of the DRM issues there is no chance I'm ever going to buy this game. Diablo II got a couple sales out of me just because I lost the CD over the years, but EA and Spore can be assured I'll never buy a product made by them or Will Wright again. Good job EA, keep up the hard work."
1,Dead,"As other reviewers have kindly pointed out, this game isn't the greatest in the world -- but the assumption by EA that you, in your entire life, will apparently only install this game to your computer (or any of your current computers or future computers) 3 times is just ridiculous. The game has already been pirated and they've gotten past the protection -- instead of ""protecting"" their investment, EA has just frustrated people to the point where they'll HAVE TO download it in order to play it. Mindbogglingly stupid."
1,Ruined my Windows XP installation,"I was excited when I heard about this game. It was my first purchase of a computer game in several years. It was fun to begin with, although it became monotonous after a while. The worst part is the copy protection. I did know it had SecuROM, but SecuROM wasn't as bad last time I encountered it. My Windows partition exists to run Acrobat professional and 3D CAD programs. I formatted just before I installed this game, so I made the mistake of installing it first. Afterwards, none of my expensive and necessary professional software would install. I have since installed the game on Linux in wine, but it lacks online play now and I have to format my Windows partition again and scrub the remnants of SecuROM from the boot sectors. (FYI it doesn't even completely remove when you format. If I remember correctly, it leaves information in the boot sector which is not erased when a computer is formatted.)"
1,Weak in evry aspect,"Spore has many problems.Boring: Play through the game on carnivore can be fun right up until the space stage. In space, you are assigned pointless ""get X many of Y creature"" quests and courier quests. Playing through on herbivore takes a significantly long time to accomplish the same tasks.Too Easy: There is no challenge to Spore at all. First, there is no death penalty. Second, each stage could be passed in as little as an hour. Third, there are no surprises.DRM: DRM bad. This kind of DRM is inexcusable."
1,Returned to Amazon Refund Requested,"Returned it my purchase to Amazon unopened and requested refund for EA's draconian Digital Rights management which only allows 3 installs of game. EA's misprint in manual that allows multiple user accounts per game is WRONG per EA Customer Service.Too bad, for I was so looking forward to this game.SporeSpore Galactic Edition"
1,Absurdly restrictive,"The DRM renders this game almost totally unplayable. Assuming you can get it to work at all (and you don't mind that the DRM sticks around to gnaw on your system like a parasite), you only get a certain number of total installs before you have a 50 dollar coaster.I'll rent games elsewhere, Electronic Arts."
4,"Great fun, though sometimes a no-brainer","I've read quite a few of the reviews here about Spore. I was one of those people eagerly anticipating the game release. Yes, the complaints about the DRM system are valid. I hate them as well. But, on the flipside, I've found the game to be great fun!Moving up through all the stages (Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civ, Space) is pretty amazing. I liked the fact that nothing was set in stone. The way your creature developed was entirely dependent on how you had that creature behave. The smallest things could completely change the track it was going on.As another review pointed out, the building engine is amazing. I too spent hours just playing with the creature creator and the buildings.The strategy part of things is pretty straightforward, and so probably not a good option for someone who considers themselves a ""serious"" gamer - BUT - the playing, now that's where the fun is!!"
5,To the limits of Creativity!,Please ignore the 1 star reviews this game is amazing! I loved every minute of it! Now in response to the 1 star reviews about the DRM this is a fine game and I don't think it should be slammed 1000+ times just because people want to install it more than 3 times and most of the crashing problems are because of Vista I have XP and I have NEVER had it crash on me. Now for the actual gameplay. It was very entertaining it has various editors that let you turn your imagination into a game! You have various paint styles to select layer by layer or pre-made. There are 5 phases in-case you didn't know. 1.Cell 2.Creature 3.Tribe 4.Civilization 5.Space... Throughout the entire game there is one ultimate goal... To get to the center of the galaxy I'm not going to spoil it though and one last thing there is some humor in the game that I enjoyed greatly :)
1,Worth the DRM?,"After waiting 3 years to play it, I can honestly say that Spore is fantastic. It is almost all that I could have hoped for. I have been following websites dedicated to bringing the masses information regarding its release, previews, et cetera for a while. I bought the Creature Creator when it was first released and have a small bestiary of my own. I had high hopes.That said, DRM is the reason why I have yet to legitimately purchase this game. I was lucky enough to get the leaked version which neither requires a disk in the drive nor has limited online activations. I've enjoyed the experience, though the lack of User generated content, that which one gets when registered and goes online, is disappointing.I cannot give this game the review or score that it deserves while it still has the crippling flaws inherent in DRM."
1,Fear the Acronym: DRM,"This game has harsh/strict DRM that is invasive to your computer. It's a serious turn off to deal with it just to try to play a dang video game. Especially the fact that you can only install the game a few times!? What the hell is that? Like someone else said, you don't buy this game, you rent it - and it leaves software on your machine that you can't uninstall through conventional means.Wait to buy this for when/if they release a version without all the hassle to own."
1,DRM won't stop piracy--but it sure stops sales.,"I came here today because I was seriously thinking of buying this innovative game. It took me about 30 seconds--the time required to read a couple of explanations of the DRM nonsense--to change my mind. Good bye, Spore."
1,A DRM revolt,"Merely adding fuel to the fire, so read past reviews to see why DRM is NOT the way of the future and why everyone should think seriously before adding this game to thier cart. Here's a hint, EA: I might actually want to upgrade my computer sometime in the next five years. Of course, this wont stop it from selling out the wazoo like all Sims games, and it wont stop EA from trumpeting all of the extra copies that people are going to be inevitably buying just so they can play the game they already bought.Either way, this game will be joining Mass Effect and Bioshock on my ""do not purchase"" list."
1,the worst DRM ever,"Thanks to a horrendous activation policy, I can't install this on my gaming machine. And since I opened the package, I can't even return it. A $50 coaster! I have been shanked."
1,DRM = pre-order cancelled,"Huge shame, I had such high anticipation for this game. I was screwed with Mass Effect having been given no notice about this 3 activation limit, I had hoped there would be some common sense from EA. Glad I kept a careful eye on the forums in time to cancel my pre-order. Sorry Maxis, your a good company stuck with a lousy publisher."
1,"Was going to purchase, but no...","Like all the others posting here, I will not buy this game due to the DRM. I refuse to support these sorts of antics with my wallet and will go find another creative way to spend my $60.Also... thanks to EA for saving me the hassle of begging my wife to buy a new computer to play Spore on. You saved me some heartache."
1,secuROM ruins games,While I have been enjoying spore since I purchased it yesterday I have to say the DRM really irks me. Hopefully EA will take notice of this review bomb and maybe in the future they will do something.
1,DRM kills this dead,Hopefully the darwins law will prevail and this porrly adapted game goes the way of the dodo.
1,Stay AWAY!!!! SecureROM=Manure Experience!!!,"One of the most highly anticipated games of the year is a DRM NIGHTMARE!!! EA's use of secureROM limits you, THE RIGHTFUL OWNER, to three installs. If you are like most tweaking reformatting gamers, you'll hit that limit in no time. Heck, with Windows Vista, I'm reformatting once a quarter. STAY AWAY, STAY AWAY, STAY AWAY!!! I'd give this game NEGATIVE five stars if I could!!!"
1,what it could have been,"this game had the potential, it really did. then the douches at ea totally turned everyone off with this bs. its really sad that people spent years developing a great game with a great idea only to have their years of hard work spoiled by they greedy f**ks up top. good work EA!!"
1,DRM? No thank you.,Since its got DRM I will not buy it. It is a showstopper and the games simply gets the lowest rating from me.
1,"DRM-infested game, not recommended","If you buy this DRM-infested game, you can only install it three times - after that, you have to call a hotline to activate it again. You don't buy but rent it, but only for the full buying price. No thanks, this is ripping of the customer. We don't need this, instead buy another game that lets you do what you want with it."
1,The game breaks itself. Stay away.,"The game stops working after trying to install it 3 times. The DRM makes it useless if you have problems with it, or if you like to upgrade your machine. Consider the disk worthless in a few years when you want to install it again and play it, you will likely be out of luck because you have installed it too many times or EA no longer feels like paying to run the activation server for a game they stopped selling years before.Thumbs down."
1,No more DRM,"Until I can safely install and uninstall Spore without using up my activations, I will not be purchasing this. When will they get that enough is enough. They have crossed a line and they need to step back."
1,EA epic fails again,"EA consistantly screws up games to the point of making them unplayable. It's ironic that when I spent money buying command and conquer 3 that it didn't work for months until SIX patches had been released, the final one finally letting me play.As a result I swore never to purchase another EA title, and it looks like I made the right choice. If anything, such crappy DRM is going to stop people buying future EA games and just pirating them, since hey, they have to pirate them anyway for them to even work.This game is a waste of money because it won't even install properly."
1,Sick and tired of DRM hurting paying public,"Why would EA think limiting me to only three installs on a game that I bought and own is a good idea? I'm glad I waited for consumer ratings before buying the game. Like always DRM is hurting the people who have bought the game legally. The pirates will have a perfectly working game and we will not. Wake up EA, learn from the music industry. I want to pay you for a fully functioning product that works for as long as I want it to work. You can't pretend to sell me something that you are really renting to me and hope I don't notice. I am not stupid!If you want to rent to game to me set it's price at $9.99 and call it a rental. It's a shame that DRM will kill such a promising game."
1,"Nice game, shame about the DRM","I didn't really consider the DRM issue when I bought Spore, but after reading about it yesterday decided to add my vote against it. Why should I get a worse deal than people pirating the game?Bit of a shame really, since it's actually good fun to play. Come on EA, you can fix this with a patch and get your reputation back."
1,"Installs VIRUS in background, BEWARE!","The DRM for the game utilizes securom which is essentially a virus that installs itself without warning when you install the game. There is no way to completely remove it without reformatting and it is constantly running in the background if not removed. Sucking up computer resources.It also is overpriced. This is actually a RENTAL, not a bought game because it only lets you install 3 times. If you install over 3 times then you must call EA customer support and beg them to let you play the game you bought. Did I mention the call is not free? If you live outside the U.S. it will be a very expensive call.DO NOT BUY THIS, and if you do buy it keep in mind that you are renting it. Not buying it. Whats really ironic about this is the DRM hasn't even stopped the pirates as it was pirated a few weeks ago. And the pirated version doesn't have Securom or install limits which makes it a better version. EA shouldn't treat its consumers like trash."
1,Guilty Until Proven Innocent,"It's a great game, it really is. Kudos to Will Wright.However, EA has assumed that all of their customers are criminals. And you have to prove to them that you're not with this horrendous DRM. Nice way to treat your customers, EA.I bought the game before I knew about this. Until you stop treating me like a criminal, EA, you won't be getting any more of my money."
1,Not Interested Anymore,"Based on the hype this game has received in the media, I thought I would give this game a chance and came here to Amazon to purchase. Fortunately, after reading the reviews here I will NOT be purchasing the game. Any game that imposes such draconian DRM will never be installed on my system. I do not appreciate being treated like a thief."
1,no effing way,"I got this as a gift from some well-meaning friends, but there's no way I'm putting anything with Sony DRM anywhere near my system. If I want spyware on my system, I'll let my nieces play on it. And that's NOT gonna happen! My copy is going to stay inside its shrinkwrap until doomsday, I guess."
1,This game is terrible,"Supporting this game is like supporting the idea that EA thinks you're stupid. I have heard that Will Wright and EA said they did not want a ""97 "" rated quality game like half life but a ""90"" rated game like ""the sims"". So basically they assume you want dumbed down content. They're saying you're stupid."
1,DRM Kills Spore,"With over 2,000 1 star reviews of the time of this writing, it's not too hard to see why hardcore and even casual gamers are rallying against EA and other producers to stop DRM. Rather than punish the average user for legally buying the game, EA needs to study why people pirate games as opposed to encouraging more to pirate.The game as a whole is mediocre at best since the game play is so dumbed down that it's no longer fun."
1,Just in time!,"I was just getting ready to purchase the much anticipated new game Spore when I decided to read the reviews on Amazon. Glad I did. After learning about the DRM 3 install limit, I decided not to purchase this game. Shame on EA."
1,Disappointing,"Awful end product. The game itself allows for quite a bit of customization, but in a very limited way. The creature creator and first two stages are great, but from that point on the customization grows very dull. Incredible programming and great concept, but poorly pulled off. The gameplay is very shallow (basic, 2 dimensional) and quickly grows boring. I couldn't even play through the entire game once before sticking it on a shelf and forgetting it existed, I doubt I'll ever play it again either. My disappointment may be due to the large amount of hype before it's release, but the game truly did seem very dull."
1,DRM ruins it.,"You aren't buying a game. You're buying a license. One that they can pretty much revoke at any time for any reason. I have games that are 14+ years old that I still play fairly often. Unless someone hacks it, this game won't be playable in 12 years. I'd be surprised if they keep the registration servers running for 5 even. You _must_ register it online (so without an internet connection the game won't run at all), and you can only register it three times. If your computer crashes, if you get a new computer, if you simply get bored with it and uninstall - there goes a registration. So, because you just have bad luck with computers or don't have enough hard drive space to have just sitting there, EA assumes you're trying to 'steal' their game.I was thinking about checking this game out, because it seems like an interesting concept. But from what I hear, it's not that great anyways, and there's no way I'm giving my money to a company that assumes I'm a thief."
1,No Purchase Until DRM Is Removed,"I've been looking forward to this since the first GDC video, but I'm afraid that the DRM is a show stopper for me.I don't have a problem with some online activation, but not if it creates any form of impediment for me. That includes limited install numbers (even if un-installing incremented the number, I can't be certain I'll remember to do that).I want to play it, and then my wife will want to play it, and I plan to reinstall my PC in the next month or so. There's my 3 installs right there.I'm not calling EA to beg to play a game I paid for. It takes me less than 3 fingers to tell you what I think of that."
2,After a while boring :(,Well DRM is an issue. But the games playability is a lot more important. I HAVE the game. I didn't have any DRM issues (yet).I have played the game for about 30 hours this week. And i agree with most of the other reviews. Its fun at first but gets boring very fast.Is it a fun game? Sometimes but mostly boring after a while.Could the DRM become a problem in the future? Maybe.Would I buy the game today after playing it? Nope
1,Sporely Disappointed in the DRM,$50 is a lot to only get to rent a video game... And I really wanted to buy this!
1,EA patch this thing now,"Even without the DRM issue, it's probably the most broken retail game I have ever played.Don't bother buying it until EA release a patch, you will be wasting your money."
1,DRM Is No Fun!,"Guess what happens if you try to install this game more than 3 times? You can't!That's right if you get a new hardrive, new computer, or anything like that you're out of luck!"
1,Tech specs too high with too much DRM,"I'm disappointed that at game in development for ten years won't run on my one year old laptop. The graphics seem cartoonish enough to be viewable on less than cutting edge graphics cards. I'd like to play it, but I'm not about to replace computers than can play all my other games (like WoW and AoC) in order to run Spore. I can't stand EA's DRM. Maybe if they patch it out, I'd try it..."
1,Draconian DRM kills this game.,"Do not purchase this game as an act of protest against draconian DRM. When I buy a game, I expect to be able to play with it on as many PCs as I'd like. I understand why you may wish to limit the number of concurrent users to 1 but to prevent me from installing it on my home computers and my laptop or by limiting my ability to install the game in the future is simply unacceptable."
1,This Purchase Was a Mistake,I made the mistake of purchasing this game without researching the DRM. I am very disappointed. There are plenty of games to play. Buy one that won't create extra hassle for you and treat you like a common software pirate.
1,The DRM is more complex than the game play,"If you go over your limit of 3 installs, you will probably spend more time on the phone with EA than you will actually playing the game. Why do they still insist on punishing legitimate, paying customers?The last game I purchased was Sins of a Solar Empire because it was DRM Free! Support the publishers who sell games for gamers!"
1,Fun game just had to reconfigure my hole computer to play it (DRM) issues.,"I've been waiting for this game for a long time, When it came out I could not run it due to the DRM (Digital Rights Management). I had to re-image my machine and by that point it was my third and finial install. So If my computer crashes and want to play it again, I'll have to by it again. Thanks EA, Take a game with great creativity, easily playable and all around. The game is the brain child of Will Wright a incredible games designer who made a incredible game, to bad EA wrapped the game in a DRM package.Too bad"
1,Won't be treated like a criminal,"Like many others here, Spore is a title of interest to me but I will not spend good money on a game that infects my system with SecuROM or any other DRM technology.While customers paying for this game legally have to deal with SecuROM and installation limits those pirating the game don't have any such concerns and a simple Google search shows that there are thousands upon thousands currently pirating the game.Paying customers get the raw deal."
1,Avoiding Because of DRM,I never write a review without extensive first hand knowledge and use of a product but I'm making a special exemption for Spore. This game went from one of the titles I anticipated most on PC to a title that I'm avoiding altogether. Why? Digital Rights Management aka DRM. Specifically the type of DRM that Electronic Arts has decided to include with this game.The DRM known as SecuROM will only punish actual customers by enforcing a totalitarian online verification. Why? Because this so called anti-piracy DRM was already 'cracked' days before the game even hit store shelves. Proof positive that enforcing this type of rigid DRM only affects legitimate customers.In addition to verifying your copy of the game every time you take it online you'll also be limited to 3 installs. That's 3 installations over the entire life of the game. Anything over that and you'll be on the phone calling EA begging for a new code. Thanks but no thanks.
1,That's too bad.,"Well, you've all convinced me. It's a real shame. I was looking forward to this one. Who doesn't love SimCity and the Sims? But to bundle it with a virus-like DRM suite... ouch. Feels like I'm persecuted for doing nothing wrong. I'd rather wait and see if this little Amazon revolution helps convince the distributors that DRM's not the answer. I honestly was *THIS CLOSE* to buying this from the EA online store Sunday night... Glad I haven't yet. The problem is, your average joe consumer probably doesn't know what DRM is until it screws up their computer, so this game, thanks to its gratuitous marketing, will make a mint. And EA will congratulate themselves that SecuROM was worth adding."
1,3 strikes and I'm out?,I have been eagerly awaiting this game since it was first mooted but now I find that I am limited to three activations under the draconian DRM that EA has seen fit to include with the game. I was hoping that I would be able to play this game for many years to come but with only three activations I am effectively renting it. I don't rent games.
1,my money will be spent elsewhere,"I logged on Amazon with the intent to buy Spore. I always read reviews before my final decision. My main concern is bugs. Too many software titles are released before they are finished. If they need a years worth of patches, I will just wait until they drop in price and have their problems solved. In the case of DRM, i will not buy the game. So wave good bye to my $50 EA."
1,DRM is useless,"DRM is a useless annoyance for legitimate users of games. To be frank, it's like gun control. All gun control does is make it harder for people who want to buy and register guns legally. A criminal will buy a gun on the street from another criminal, completely bypassing the legal routes. DRM is same exact way. I don't pirate software, but I refuse to buy a game that installs spyware and other trojan-like software on my computer. Additionally, limiting the amount of times a game can be installed is stupid. Does anyone really think this will prevent piracy? The game was released yesterday. I guarantee that in less than a week, there will be a cracked version of the game on the net that people will be playing. I'm not buying this game until EA recognizes this and removes their DRM scheme. And it really, really bites because I've been a Maxis fan since the first Sim City, and I've really been looking forward to this game."
1,Not worth it,I bought (pre-ordered) Spore before I found out about the DRM scheme that EA was using. Thanks to the reviews on Amazon I could return it before I had to open it. It was worth paying the return shipping to get rid of the thing. I'm not paying then 50 bucks to rent their game for 3 installs. I wanted to thank everyone who got the word out about the DRM so that people like me could be warned.
1,To Those who don't understand the DRM issue,"The DRM is bad because it violates your right to resell something that you purchase.It is ENTIRELY different than the DRM for a console game because i can turn around and sell my copy of HALO and someone else can play it without any hassle. The DRM on a console game prevents you from making an illegal copy of the disk itself. That is not the case with Spore. It prevents you from installing a legal copy more than 3 times.Also, those who suggest that you buy the game and then crack it so that they can install it multiple times are naive as well. First of all, the DMCA makes circumventing copy protection illegal in the US. Second of all, you're suggesting that people download a crack from an unknown entity on the internet that could be opening them up to a virus or other security issue."
1,"DRM is the the Man's Hand up your ""@#%#""","DRM.If it wasn't bad enough paying for replicated intangible data, now with DRM you get to spend your little ""Pleb"" (Bertrand Russel reference) dollars on something you won't even own anymore.At $50, this would be the most expensive rental of my life... that is, if I were to dumb enough to actually pay to have my computer performance downgraded, which, thankfully I'm not.Too bad.I was looking forward to this game.Oh, well, maybe if they up the fluoride in the water system then after a few more years I'll be dumbed down enough to purchase this game."
1,This game is broken!,The DRM for this game is ridiculous. Do not even waste your time or your money!
1,"Decent game, ruined by DRM malware","The excitement over Spore's revolutionary gameplay may have been worth it---for EA employees with a fasttrack through the DRM nightmare. The Securom DRM software/hardware used on the game can damage your computer, cause other programs to fail, and is only successful in preventing legitimate users from installing the game multiple times on their own machines---a dedicated piracy attempt can still break through it.Preventing users from playing the game they paid for, while still allowing piracy. Please don't support EA games until they fix this pattern."
1,My last Maxis game,"As someone interested in games development and an owner of a complete set of Maxis products (I even kept the boxes), I was prepared to like Spore alot. Some of the parts of the game that I get to play from time to timeare amazing (I love the cut-scenes using the changing characteristics of my unique characters/tribesmen)However, the enjoyment of the early levels of the game is completely offset by the boring money management of the space exploration phase, the incompatibility of the game with my computer and OS, and the pain of the three strikes and you are out DRM. After several days of attempting to fix several of my XP machines to not crash on 3 of 4 Spore startups, I have decided that Maxis and EA can do without my gaming dollars from now on."
1,More trouble than it's worth,"Despite my reservations about the DRM and online authentication, I attempted to give this game a fair shot. For the two days I was able to actually play it, I was woefully unimpressed. Then, my account was deactivated for not being validated, despite me having gone through the validation procedures. After going back and for with EA customer service all week to no avail, I returned my copy and picked up Sins of a Solar Empire instead."
1,DRM = No Purchase,"I've been looking forward to Spore for years, I would purchase it regardless of the mediocre reviews except for that fact that I won't touch anything with DRM. There's plenty of other games to buy and I will vote with my dollars. I pay to buy games, not rent them."
1,DRM Sucks!,Don't buy this game!!! EA has gone to far with DRM and users need to show them they have done wrong.
2,Spore,"I heard that Amazon took down the reviews warning people about the unreasonably restrictive DRM on this game and did not believe it. Well, seeing is believing. I can no longer trust Amazon to have an impartial rating of products so will I will definitely not be using their rating in future purchase decisions. There have been thousands of negative reviews of this product and by taking down the reviews Amazon is confirming that their only interest is in your money."
1,"Decent Game, Terrible DRM","I enjoyed the cell, land animal, and space sections of the game, but the tribal and civilization phases are terrible. This could have been a modern Sim Earth but they decided to dumb it down for the masses.The DRM that comes with this game is absolutely unacceptable. Spend your money elsewhere."
1,No DRM!!!!!!!,"My Wife and I each have a desktop and a laptop. After installing it on each desktop and my laptop we discovered we couldn't load it on my wife's my laptop. I'm sorry I didn't realize I was renting a game I paid for! EA, maybe I'll just wait on the next few games you bring out.Maybe they are intending to sell this to the lonely guy in his basement, because it's certainly not to the American family. And obviously the DRM is working SOOOO well. Hey Maybe TPB could come out with a Pirate Collectors Edition that's the more featured Edition. Wish I could buy that!!"
1,Real review not just a DRM complaint,"I love games like Civilization and the sims. This is a bastardized version of both. It is insulting how little thought has gone into the complexity of the game.Also, I know this is due to the DRM, but I bought the game so I could play and when I am not on my computer my daughter could play too. She is not allowed to have her own account on my computer. So, if you have fmaily members without their own computer they are SOL.Worst purchase I ever made."
4,"Simple, Creative & Fun","To be honest, I could care less about DRM & online logging. This game will be played through maybe one motherboard or hardrive upgrade. I will never have to install this more than three times. Plain & simple the game delivers exactly what the developers had in mind..... FUN. The game is fun to play. The creatures are fun to upgrade and you do get a nice mix of mix of gaming genre. Any clear thinking gamer wants the gaming industry to be free of pirates. Buy the game and enjoy it for what it is... FUN."
1,Stop punishing your customers,A good game spoiled by the absurd restrictions on its use by paying customers. I wouldn't have bought this if I'd known you can only install it 3 times. This is the last straw - all this DRM nonsense has gone too far. Why should I be penalised for buying a game that other people rip off? I've had enough of this now and this is the last crippled game I will buy.
1,DRM? No thanks.,"What an awful, awful product. No way, no how, no Spore, no EA. Thanks for punishing people who actually give you money EA. What a joke EA is."
1,Disappointed,"If the DRM didn't exist (particularly the 3 install limit portion), then I would probably be adding this game to my cart instead of writing this comment. It is really a shame too because it sounds like a lot of fun. I don't mind efforts to reduce piracy, but when those efforts start impacting legit customer decisions when it comes to purchasing then you know you are doing something wrong.If I am not mistaken, most pirates expect to not be able to play their illegal copies online anyways so I really do not see how the DRM helps the situation other than give some people a false sense of it's positive effect on their business.I guess stranger things have happened in the business world, but I just don't get this one."
1,What a disappointment,I've been looking forward to this game for a year and a half. Gameplay is not nearly as sophisticated as I had anticipated from early discussion. I'll eventually learn to quit getting bitten by disappointment from EA.
2,"Love the game, hate the protection","I love this game. I could spend hours and hours facing my monitor creating and exploring. The game play is fascinating at the space level and fun prior to that.I can't stand the DRM and copy protection scheme though. Despite myself, I purchased a copy directly from EA because I've been looking forward to this game very much. It's a catch 22. Buy the game and enjoy it and EA thinks we're fine with the DRM, or don't buy the game and EA blames pirates for lost profits. Either way, they won't see that the DRM is effecting their bottom line."
1,"In sadness, I join the majority.","I have been looking forward to writing a five-star review of Spore since 2006. I have always admired Will Wright, and Spore seemed to promise the pinnacle of his creative dreams.Sadly, the heavy-handed Digital Rights Management decisions that Maxis seem to have made have ruined the experience, and entitle this release only to one star.Spore is already available on line at no charge to thieves, and they will not have to deal with the draconian DRM.We, the faithful and honest who have paid for our version are being punished. It is my intention to return this software to Amazon, and wait for a release that honors the faithful with a manageable DRM system.It's really just too bad. What a disappointment."
1,Average game severely hurt by DRM.,"The games somewhat fun to play in spite of the fact that the gameplay is very simplistic and there is no real challenge. Unless you really enjoy the design elements you probably won't be playing it very long. If that is your cup of tea than you need to first look at whether you can deal with the DRM or not. The good news is there are plenty of reviews here to fill you in on it. Personally, I can't really recommend an average game with over the top DRM. Research before you buy."
1,too bad,"I was very excited about this game. I could not wait to buy it, almost a no brainer. DRM has changed all of that. Until they change the piracy system to one that will not invade my computer this way, i am no customer of EA's."
1,More DRM nonsense,"I was really excited about this game, but when I found out about the copy protection limitations, I decided to skip out on it.When they clean out the copy protection, I'll buy it, but there's no way I'm paying $50 to EA so they can treat me like a criminal.And a crack has already been released. In other words, the pirates are offering a better version for free than EA is asking money for. When will they learn?"
1,"Boring Gameplay, Enraging DRM","The gameplay was really boring. After about 6 hours, you've seen all you want to see. I don't understand why this game took more years than usual and yet is worse than most other releases out there.Perfect example: the game is supposed to be about evolution, but you spend more time customizing how your creature looks than how it performs. Why? Because while there are 100 different things you could put on your creature, and you COULD put 3 mouths and 5 legs, you get NO benefit over having 1 mouth and 1 leg. How lame is that?!Also, as countless others have said... the DRM is insane.Save yourself the money... if you want to play a casual game, there are plenty of free (or really really cheap) ones out there."
1,Can't even install it,"I was very excited to play this, but my dvd drive can't even read the disk! After searching online, I understand that this is due to some insane DRM controls. Now what am I supposed to do with a $50 piece of plastic that I can't even return?! Unbelievable."
1,Bugs and DRM Make Spore a No-Buy,"Paid $50 for the game without realizing I don't actually own it, I'm just renting it from EA. Had I known you can only install 3 times, I wouldn't have purchased it. It also has a couple of major bugs that I wouldn't expect to see in a polished release. On top of that, the game is not much more than a simplified clone of Warcraft I, Civilization, and Escape Velocity thrown together. If I had it to do over again, I would stay away from Spore."
1,DRM is a deal-killer,"i was looking forward to this game, but since I constantly upgrade and change my PC with new parts, I usually don't go 1 year without a clean OS install. I won't spend money on a game that I may not be able to play."
1,Return,"Well I never got to play Spore, and it doesnt look like I will, now that I'm seeing all this DRM, I'm going to be returning the game right away. I dont pirate game, never have and never will, but I refuse to install a malicious DRM program onto my computer that has a high chance of doing nothing but harm, sucks up RAM, and can pretty much only be removed by wiping the HD."
1,Won't buy it because of Securom,"I was really interested in this game, but after reading about all of the problems with the nasty Securom DRM, I am going to give this game a miss. Too bad, it looks like it could have been a lot of fun."
1,DRM ruines it,"Not even worth thinking about until the DRM is fixed. What a show stopper! You'd think after so much time, effort, hype and anticipation they would have released something playable.But no, EA forgot what it means to market a product. Customers purchase goods and services, they don't like spending their money on products they are completely restricted from using.Better luck next time."
1,Loyal customer lost because of DRM,"I'm sure EA are aware of these reviews given that the news of them has now gone global with news networks around the world picking up the story, so this review is to EA.I'm a loyal customer and had been waiting for months to buy Spore. But now with all this stuff about the DRM and limited to 3 installs of the game... No way!! I appreciate you want to protect the game from piracy but not at the expense of your loyal paying customers. I'm actually thorn by this as I was so eager to play Spore but I'd rather save my money instead of risking complete computer damage, data loss, and the eventual loss of Spore itself after 3 installs. If you ever cop on and release this game DRM free with unlimited installation counts, you'll get my custom back. Shame on you, EA!!"
1,DRM is terrible,"The DRM on this game is terrible. You can only install it three times, after which you have to call EA and beg them to be nice enough to let you install the game you paid for again. I have a separate copy of Windows that I use just for gaming, and I erase it several times a year to keep it clean and virus/malware free. So I'll get to play my $50 game for 9 months or so before I am forced to BEG for the PRIVILEGE of playing it some more."
1,DRM infected.,"This product does not work without internet access, and is filled with awful DRM that probably makes it less than a wise investment. Also the game play seems less than put-together -- almost just an expansion of the creator creator."
1,DRM is a total show-stopper,"I usually change machines a couple of times per year (or more!) and this draconian DRM scheme will fail me miserably. I will not be purchasing this game.Don't buy this game. Don't support DRM. They should be forced to call it a ""rental"", since that is closer to the truth."
1,Don't hate can't open on computer,Haven't been able to open it on computer and haven't been to contact anyone for help very disappointingMy grandson really wants to play this game
1,Didn't load to our Mac and therefore was unusible,I would have gave it 0 stars but that wasn't an option. If the items say PC MAC on then they should stop selling them if they require unattainable updates.
1,DRM + SecuRom,"The game is an amazingly fun and innovative scheme. What I can not-> and will not do -> is support EA's draconian idiocy. By increasing DRM and faulty coding related to piracy the game will not run on my PC. I went too the pirates looking for a way to get it to work.So I bought the game, but I am likely returning it and will not go forward with this until it is put in a state ready for consumption and for our rights."
1,DRM Eh... ORDER CANCELLED,"I had enough trouble with the last DRM I HAD to deal with, seeing as there is no choice, and no real uninstall choice, besides a healthy format.What a joke. If this is the future from EA, then I guess Sims 2 will be something I'm not going to play either..*sigh*"
1,DRM = No way!,"The DRM restrictions on this game are not only ridiculously heavy-handed, but it would appear that EA thinks its customers are stupid. EA, can you honestly expect me to contact you after I've installed or reinstalled the game I purchased for 50 bucks- and then beg you to give me additional installations? I won't drop a dime on this game until you remove the DRM. Sorry."
1,DRM and 3 Install Feature,"Among the most brutal I have seen. I was pretty hyped over this game, ive been looking for something like this for years, only to have it thrown in my face with a 3 install limit (EA is as belligerent as Microsoft). Im more fired up with an install limit then over the DRM. DRM only provokes pirating, the more secure you try to make it, the harder and faster they work to exploit it. EA lost all credibility with me and I will no longer purchase a product that has an EA flag anywhere on it.Good Job EA! keep up the good work of ruining good games!"
1,"Just bought it, wish I would have read this first.","I have to say I concur with the thousands of others who do not agree with the DRM. I just bought the game and had I known when I bought it I could only install it three times I would have said forget it. Sorry guys, I like to buy stuff not rent it....."
1,Would Have Bought Until Read About DRM,I loved the original spore creator but would never buy a game like this with the packaged DRM. It obviously did not stop pirates and as a consumer that WANTS to purchase this game I cannot because this DRM makes it unplayable. EA really ruined this product with this.
1,Very disappointed.,"I have purchased quite a few great games over the last 10 years and I continue to keep playing them every time I get a new computer or have to reinstall Windows or, now, OSX.The problem with this game is that you can't reinstall it more than three times.Let's say you install it on your current computer, and then get a new computer in a year. That's two. If you also have a laptop to play on the go, you're at three. If you get a new computer or have to reinstall the OS on any of them, you're out another $50 to buy this game again.That's unacceptable and you too should make it clear to EA by just saying NO to buying this game."
1,DRM -- CAN NOT INSTALL MORE THAN 3 TIMES,"I like this game... It's fun... It's kinda cool.. BUT I GAVE it 1 STAR.. WHY? because you cant actually buy the game.. you can only rent it.. You get a DVD that lets you install it 3 times... Only 1 Account can be linked to the game.. so if you have a sibling or father / son etc who might buy a copy, understand you'll need TWO copies...Once you've installed it 3 times you have to call EA to get it reactivated.. Perhaps I can give you some advice.. If you buy this game protest by learning how to crack or otherwise bypass the DRM (start by googling gamecopyworld )... Maybe if enough people turn to cracking to stop the protection they'll change.. So far they have yet to do so...Dont get me wrong.. spore is kinda fun... But do what ever you can to help cause trouble for EA.. They need to know this is not acceptable..."
1,DRM? No thanks....,"Like others here I have had issue in the past with DRM - Thank you Adobe and Apple. DRM is fine for an average user - but think about it - this is a game. Many people who play games build new systems to have the latest and greatest, or have multiple machines. I know I do. Two regularly used ones in my office, a laptop for work and a personal Laptop - My wife also has a computer. So if we install it and reach our limit because we retire a machine that had it and replace it with a new one - We have to call EA? Screw that. I have returned the game and bought some BR movies instead. I will either wait until EA releases a version that isn't limited like this or download the version that doesn't have DRM - Thats right - pirate it - then I wont be limited anyway. DRM is a failed attempt at control and has become an annoyance for anyone over an average user (especially in this case when there are much better ways to ensure someone paid for your game)."
1,drm killed another ea game,the drm and draconian limited install liscense ruined what potentially could have been a fun game.
1,Sad,I have the Creature Creator. I bought it at EBGames. I will not buy a copy of the full game so long as it has programs on it other then the game. DRM.. not much of a selling point.
1,Dirtbag Customers!,I feel like EA is calling me a dirtbag for buying something from them. What exactly am I spending $50 for? Apparently not a opy of the game as EA is making it clear we do not have any rights to it. I don't get it. I am PAYING THEM! The priates are downloading it for free and they don't have any limits? Am I supposed to be happy that I am being punished for someone elses crime? Am I still in grade school and someone forgot to tell me? ANY limit on installs is punishment the customer has to take. It is no deterent to the pirate AT ALL! Do you guys understand that by now?
1,DRM - Really??,"You make a game, you sell a game. Some people steal, that's life. You knew all of these things when you made the game, if you didn't like them, you didn't have to make the game. DRM cripples the longevity of this game."
1,DRM just brings down the whole experience,"The DRM implementation contained with the game, just bring down the whole experience for the game. Its not worth buying, let alone installing on ones computer. Stay way!"
1,DRM is unacceptable,"A three install limit is identical to a game rental. For anyone who ever changes computers or reinstalls their operating system for any reason (i.e. when windows devolves into a super slow swamp of an operating system, or upgrading your mac os to the newest version), you lose a license. It's just not right. Really shameful of EA."
1,No way in hell,This is a perfect example of how to ruin a great game. There is no chance that I will purchase this game now.
1,Another Notch in EA's EVIL belt,"Wow. I'm so glad I read these reviews before buying this. Freaking EA man, they don't care about the customer, and it seems they delight in tormenting the player. Draconian? Their system sounds downright Satanic! Poor Will Wright. What could have been a legacy and legend in gaming is destroyed by Corperate stupidity. Heed the warnings of the victims of EA's evil. BOYCOTT THIS CRAP. I've been waiting forever for a game like this and EA killed it before it's time.BOYCOTT EA! SHUT THEM DOWN NOW BEFORE THEY DESTROY GAMING FOREVER!"
1,"Lackluster game, crippling DRM","The game has an interesting premise: You are God.While the graphics are unique, gameplay is frustrating and linear.Controls are maddening to use, theres no real depth, no story, just you, and your creatures.You can ""share"" your creatures, and other people's can show up in your game, but really, they're just terrible variations of the same ""Club Tail predator"" and other lame creations.My recommendation: save your money, purchase something with more replay value. The crippling DRM is also a major annoyance."
1,I really wanted to buy this game but...,"I have been looking forward to buying this game, but all the negative reviews have given me pause. When will companies start listening to what their customers want? Only when they vote with the most important tool in their possession. The almighty dollar. That seems to be the only verbiage they understand."
1,poor gameplay+ DRM,"DRM sucks, game kind of sucks. stick with the creature creator demo.. is drm-free!. dont buy!"
1,DRM this draconian will get you eventually,"I hope this game gets buried in a deep pile of manure.DRM like this is insulting to paying customers.Take your $50 and spend it on something that won't interfere with how you'll use it in real life.If you need more explanations as to why DRM is bad, go look up about MLB, Yahoo, Microsoft, and other large companies which have, or threatened to, turn off their DRM servers.What's to stop EA from doing the same?Will I get my $50 back when that happens?I'm not taking the chance, thanks for the warning to everyone who posted about this."
2,Not as good as I would have hoped,"I'm sure there were plenty of people like me who have been following this game to it's release for a long time, and I'm sure you will be just as disappointed as I was. The game play is average at best. The creation is really dumbed down and everything is based off stats, not how many arms/legs your creature has so essentially there is no point in having more than one arm/leg/claw/horn. The paint schemes are utterly lacking and your stuck with pre-made designs for your creatures. On top of that the 3 install limit (DRM) is a sad, sad joke.EA fails."
1,Waiting for a non DRM version,"I was really excited about this game and planned to make it my only game purchase until StarCraft2, but with all the DRM issues I guess I will never get a chance to buy it..DRM has ruined to many experiences in the past making music I 'bought' unplayable. Online rented movies never play, because of supposed DRM. The inability to play movies off my computer on a projector because they might be copied... Stupid problems all for LEGAL purchases... I can't buy anything with DRM, just look what happened to YAHOO music.Sorry Spore, fix it and re release!"
2,"Wow, this is not what I was waiting for.","Spore is a major, MAJOR disappointment. The gameplay is lackluster at best. Creating your creature is fairly pedestrian. The various options have little real effect on the ultimate gameplay and the difference between the options is rather sadly minor.The game is also short. By short I mean REALLY short. I finished the game in less than 5 hours. 5 hours?? That's including the tutorials! Ridiculous! Yes I can replay the game, and I have.Fact is that there is very little difference between playing through as a friendly herbivore or as mean old nasty carnivore. There's just no payoff.The creature creator was the best part of the game.And did I mention the DRM? WOW! I can install the game 3 times! I have installed it twice just to try and get it to work.Bottom line: This game needs about 5 times more content than it has right now to justify its cost. It is a shock that it took 10 years to develop this."
1,Can't install...?,"UGH, for some reason you have to activate this over the internet! I live out of reach of the internet, and can only get on at my cousin's house. Unfortunately, this means I can't play the game."
1,No sale,"I sure would like to play Spore. I'm a big fan of Will Wright's Sim-games so this is right in my wheelhouse.Unfortunately, Spore comes encumbered with Securom DRM, so I won't be picking it up.I skipped Bioshock because it came with Securom. I'll be skipping Spore for that reason too.Sorry, Will. No sale."
1,What's the Point?,"I bought this game because I've been a SIMS addict/Will Wright fan and a review in ""Time"" made Spore sound like the most wonderful game to ever be created. It was okay the first go-round creating my character and I successfully navigated the evolutionary time-line to space travel. But doing all that once was enough. No point it bothering to replay. Really NOT worth the price of admission."
1,"Yay ""Evolution: the game"" Boo DRM!",I went out and bought this game the day it came out because I trusted Will Wright and his high-concept creativity and upon playing for a few hours I am very satisfied. The game is very creative and actually somewhat educational. It is one of the few games out there that can also be considered Art.Now for the extremely sad news. I wish I would have waited a few days and read these reviews on Amazon about the DRM. The game may stop working after a few years? Are you kidding me?! EA just bought its ticket to bankruptcy. It's very sad that a great work of art is going to be harmed by the corporate world's fear of piracy. And its pretty ironic that such an innovative game about evolution is going to be stifled by an obsolete way of thinking.I hope Will Wright has the balls to speak out about this.
1,Another disappointed by DRM,"I am yet another fan who anticipated this game. I got to see an actual game demonstration at Comic-Con and it was brilliant. So I guess if you don't care about your ability to replay and revisit this game in a couple years, go ahead and buy the game.Otherwise, stay away.I was also looking forward to Mass Effect, but the same Securrom is on both games. I won't be buying either until they fix this. As others have pointed out, this doesn't prevent piracy; it only hurts legitimate customers. As sad as it makes me, they've lost yet another customer. They still haven't fixed Mass Effect, but I hope losses over both games will get them to change. We'll see, I guess."
1,SecuROM is not ok.,"Put simply, the more negative press earned from secuROM (a totally consumer-abusing DRM system), the more publishers will be forced to remove it from their games. This is quite a fun game (not quite as amazing as I expected) and I've enjoyed playing it at my friend's house - except when it doesn't start up because it thinks he doesn't own the game that he paid full price for.These restrictions are not ok at all and need to be changed immediately. I will not be purchasing this game until they are."
1,I never pirate.,I never pirated a game in my life. I own... but no way could I have a comfortable gaming experience knowing I have spore loaded on my Vista machine with only two reloads left. I already had Vista go south on me once.No thanks EA. I hope more people refuse to buy.
1,Message to EA: think twice about DRM,"Pre-ordered the game in July, got it 2 days ago.The is kind of dumb (I kind of expected more, after all the hype), but still fun (I wonder if it will be as fun 2 months from now).But the one star is not about that.It is a message to EA, and others like them: think twice before pushing DRM measures on your paying users. Enough is enough!Unfortunately I have pre-ordered the game before knowing about DRM.So now giving one star is the only way to give a message.I will probably never pre-order a game again. And I will think twice (and do the homework) before buying!"
1,EA treating legit customers as criminals,"This whole DRM / secureROM ordeal is pretty rediculous. Honostly, its almost as EA thinks that everyone that buys this game is pirating it. 3 install limits and online activation for a game mostly played OFFLINE! I update my computer quite a bit, and I reformat it every few months. That 3 limit activation screws over alot of people, and it practically encourages piracy. Why should somoene go through the hastle of activating the game when they can just download a version that has all the BS removed?I loved the sims and im enjoying spore, but after this ordeal and major headache, I regret giving EA my money, and it will be the last time I ever buy one of their games."
1,i just paid 50$ to rent a game my gf cant even play,"""so my gf and i can play this game at home without overlapping our games/save?""yes said EA...Lo and Behold! Noooo. not only did EA just rent me a crappy game, they also decided to change their minds (lie?) about the ability to have parallel accounts in the game.what a bunch of BS. i hate EA."
1,No Thanks until the DRM is gone or modified,"I love the concept, and l love the scant few minutes I got to play this game on my friends computer, but I researched the DRM and I can't buy it myself."
1,Spore - Great Game - Bad EA,"I purchased this game without any knowledge of the DRM softwre used in the game. There was NO notification of it anywhere during the installation, or on the external box. I am dissapointed.-N."
1,Was Going To,"I didn't really follow this game closely, but I saw a few screenshots here and there that made it look really cool. I thought I'd be able to find it on steam. Of course, I couldn't. Now I hear all this stuff about their DRM. I just wanna play the game :( I want to pay for it :( But I want to own it, I don't want to rent it for full price!"
1,"If you buy this game, you're apparently a criminal","EA treats the consumer as an everyday criminal and requires unnecessary software to be installed with this game to make sure you're using the copy to their standards. To play the game you must enjoy this extra software, you have no option to opt out - why should I pay to be treated like a criminal?"
1,Bad bad bad,"Purchased and will be returning. Not only is the DRM a problem, after installation it bogged my internet connection down. After uninstall (and manual removal of SecuRom) the connection was back to normal. Reinstalled and had same thing. Tried another installation on 2nd machine and got nailed with more than three installations.I won't be calling EA for reactivation, the retailer will be returning the box.The gameplay I did see was just a cutdown RTS. Some innovation but really isn't all that good overall."
1,Bad DRM,"I can't support a game that amounts to a rental. Your purchase of this game will eventually expire as you ""evolve"" to using different computers (or even upgrading your own!).If they re-release this game without the DRM shackles than you should take another look.The central tenant of this game, evolution, is the only interactive feature they got right. Strategy and quest value is nonexistent. Good graphics though. :) They should talk to their co-workers who make Red Alert to find out how to make good quests. ;)"
1,Lackluster gameplay and EVIL DRM,"Through the first two stages of Spore I've been very disappointed and so far the game has not even come close to the hype. It's cute, for sure but overall I'm left with that same feeling I had after drinking the kool-aid prior to the release of Black & White and Fable.Add to this, EAs customer-hating 3 install DRM and you've got a real stinker of a product. If I could play the game, uninstall it and pass it on to a friend or sell it the oeverall value proposition would be much greater.As it is now......MEH."
1,It's really just too bad.,"This game appeared to have GREAT potential, and EA ruined it with the DRM.I can't recommend this game to anyone at all until SecuROM and install limits are no longer included.I will not pay $50 to RENT a game. I will not allow something to be installed without my consent that can harm my computer.I will not be treated like a criminal."
1,Great game but spoilt totally by DRM,"Bought Spore to play on my Macbook ProOnly found out about the DRM after I opened the box and did the 1st install.Now that I opened it, I can't return itThere was no mention about the DRM or 3x install imposed outside the box.Had I known about the blasted DRM was in place, I wouldn't have bought the game in the first place"
1,"I don't ""rent"" PC games for $50",I will not be purchasing spore until they remove the install limit. There is no reason to punish the people who are willing to support the games while the people who pirate get a better version of the software and can install as many times as they want. Wake up EA. Gamers can unite and send a clear message to you in the language you understand; lost revenue.
1,A Honest Review with little DRM,"I picked up Spore for my Mac, and the game is marginally fun, though I do feel that it is dumbed down from the original hype. The graphics are a bit slow on a Macbook Pro. That is disappointing. I am a big fan of the Civ line and Sim line, and like building new worlds, and I have mixed feelings about the challenges of Spore.But if you like dumbed down games with lots of fun carnivorous activity for wasted hours of simple-minded rapture, then Spore is for you.That being said, I am opposed to the DRM in the game as DRM has gotten restrictive to the point where it is very inconvenient to the user. I am a firm believer in consumer rights and oppose DRM. There that is said."
3,"Not bad, but gets boring after a few times.","Delivery was generally fast, not as fast as I would've liked but it didn't take 2 weeks. The game itself tends to freeze at some parts & my computer exceeds all the requirements but I'm hoping that they will have some patches to fix it soon."
1,"DRM aside, the game is riddled with bugs",The DRM is obviously evil and need not be further talked about. The game is broken. There are so many bugs that make my computer crash that it is almost unplayable. I have a top of the line computer and for a game to continually crash on me is not acceptable. One wonders whether or not EA has a quality control department.
1,Serious compatibility issues for Mac and Vista PC,"One of my sons plays the iPod version of Spore and so we bought the Mac/PC version. Our Mac is less than a year old, but if you read the fine print the full feature set will only run on very new Macs. We then installed it on my Vista PC, which is brand new, with lots of memory and a fast graphics card. It installed OK but kept shutting down. The EA help forum contained a complex set of instructions for running this in Vista Compatibility Mode, but I doubt we'll bother. I strongly suggest not buying this game until the bugs are worked out."
1,DRM kills resale market,"Played this game at a friends house, not only is it over hyped but it has crazy DRM restrictions on it designed to kill the resale market. I will not buy this game."
4,Get over yourself,"I purchased this game and my son bought a copy of the DS version for himself. So far it is a fun game on both platforms. It is cool that the creatures we created in Creature Creator show up in our worlds.About DRM... Three installs may seem ""draconian"" to some, but it is because of YOU that they must resort to this. I purchase what amuses me with real money I earn by working for a living. Quite frankly, I resent that I have to deal with DRM because of dumba** trash who would rather steal than buy. It is the same inconvenience I experience when a cashier has to pull a magnetic guard off a game disk, leather coat, or SD card.I am not angry at EA for their DRM. I am angry at YOU! YOU ARE THE PROBLEM!"
2,"Spore, the most anticipated game ever to bore me.","I wanted to love this game, really, I did. But I can't. It is so repetitive... stupid games of Simon Says over and over again to impress creatures, oh look these guys want me to play a flute... again, dumb. Then you get to the massive space phase with the WORST gaming controls I have ever seen. Flying the space craft is the most bass ackwards thing I have ever seen in a video game. This game was not worth my money. I am sad I bought it."
2,Not so hot,I think it's unfortunate that the DRM issues with the game are somewhat obscuring the fact that it's just not a very good game overall.The game is basically 5 mediocre games in one.You talk about the new procedural animation / creature generation but that only comes into play really in one phase (the creature phase) which was over for me in about 1.5 hours.The mechanics are very easy to exploit and there's not really a challenge anywhere in the game. The space stage is tedious as hell.
1,3 installs and then a call? no thanks,there is simply no reason to punish honest gamers who wish to support a product.
2,Oh snap!,I think this game is a blast... I wish i would've known about the DRM before I installed it on my laptop as well for the heck of it. There goes 2/3 installs :(
1,"Yeah, Right, 10 years in development, more like 10 Minutes.","This game is so simplistic I went from Cell to Space in 3 and 1/2 hours, another hour in and I was ready to take over the galaxy. Not only does it have a sort play time, but the graphics are not even that good, I think they make the screen shots look better then they really are. The game crashes, the DRM is so restrictive that you can only install it 3 times before you have to call the support staff and be talked down to like a pirate. Yeah, EA, go have fun with your little spore DRM world."
1,Sale of 2 copies on hold,"I bought the creature maker and was really looking forward to playing the game. I had read that they removed securerom from the final product. It's disappointing that they didn't, because I was here to buy two copies, one for meSpore Galactic Editionand one for my SOSpore.Please remove the DRM. I really want to give you $100. Please?"
1,Most over-hyped game of the year?,Maybe I was excited because of the all the hype surrounding this game. I expected more and was severely let down. This game does not have enough to keep me interested beyond a few minutes. This is an example of over doing the marketing.I also had to restore my PC from a ghost image to get rid of the SecureRom DRM virus that this game installs. I will never trust them again.
2,"DRM aside, the game's just not very good.","This review will get lost in the sea of negative reviews based on the DRM, but it's not going to change the average negative review of this game.DRM aside, the game is just not very good. It's like a mish-mash of several poorly designed minigames. The best feature about this game is the creativity of the creature creation, which is completely ruined by the fact that certain features and body parts are unbalanced.This game isn't very fun. After about 2 days, I'm done with it and want to sell it off...unfortunately, I think I used up 2 licenses when I installed it, so I'm stuck ith it."
1,EA has to listen to the customers.,I will not purchase Spore until EA changes the Digital Rights Management software.
1,DRM...more like DRFAIL,"this game is one of which you might actually want to read the installation agreement, because who knows what the heck EA is putting on your computer with all this DRM garbage."
1,DRM IS EVIL (I hope a DRM patch is out soon),"Well, I hate games that treat you like a criminal with DRM.Install limits are stupid and annoying, especially if you are a power user who rebuilds or reinstalls the OS a few times a year! Or if you want to play on you notebook and let the kids plays on their PC and play it on your PC. Sure, that sounds like hey, thats only 3 installs...right? Well until like I said before, you need to wipe a machine and start over. Anyway, I love the game concept and its potential, but I hope sales fall waaaay short if they keep the DRM the way it is."
2,gamer,This is a great game if you have the right computer. We couldn't install it on the laptop we had downloaded the game on. It's unfortunate it needs so much video memory. We exchanged it for the ds game instead.
3,It's o.k.,"but doesn't really live up to my expectations due to all the hype. It runs great on XP e6400 2G 7900gsThe play is smooth and -very- easy to follow. Creature, vehicle, structure, etc. creation is lots of fun. Have spent literally hours fiddling around with those. Space is favorite section for the -gaming-ness of it. I guess I was looking to be as enthralled as I was with Black & White. I really cared about my creature in that one. Sorry, TMI.Oh yeah, that drm scheme sounds like it will suck someday. I reformat or swap OS frequently. Won't be able to sell it off when I get done with it either. Oh well, it's only $50 bucks."
1,Plan before buying,"This game's limit of 3 installs means that even though I bought the game now, I'm holding off on installing it until after I upgrade my computer. If I'd known about the limit, I would have waited before purchasing it."
1,save your money,"terrible DRM and pretty basic game play have ruined what could have been an amazing and groundbreaking title. In an era where the console games are taking the lions share of the market, the dyed in the wool PC gamer can really only expect 3-4 great titles per year. Despite the hype though this isn't one of them."
1,Don't buy this game until they treat their customers right!,"I was really excited about this game, until I heard that it came with a DRM system that means that you can only try to install it three times, and then you're locked out.I just had to deal with a motherboard swap that broke some of my applications and requires a reinstall, so I'm all too aware of how easy it is to find yourself needing to reinstall things. It isn't even ""three installs a year"", it's three total, forever.When companies treat their customers with contempt, they don't deserve customers. They only way to stop this kind of nonsense is for customers to say ""No"" to games laden with obnoxious DRM."
1,DRMed to death,"Thanks to EA and its horribly thought out DRM scheme, I have not been able to play SPORE since my first 10 minute test this weekend. I have not been able to reinstall the game after deleting it per the EA support team's suggestion as I cant get past the DRM test on the fresh install. Thanks EA, but I will no longer rent/buy your games if you insist on this system. I am sure some pirate is happily playing this game while I am typing and staring at my retail box."
1,Shouldve called it Shat,"This game sucks. EA sucks. DRM sucks. Seaman for Dreamcast was better than this pile. What a waste of money this game is. Avoid at all costs. People call the Designer of this game (Will Wright) a genius, I call him a moron for making this game. Dont buy this game, if you do just know you will only be renting it. This game isnt for hardcore gamers, hence the reason they make it for the PC and the frikkin DS. Stupid game, stupid idea, stupid gameplay, stupid Spore."
1,"Won't be buying this one, sadly","I've been anxiously waiting about 3 years for spore to come out, and I am so sadly disappointed with this DRM riddled nonsense that EA has released. It makes no sense to me that a company can create a situation where pirated copies of their game are unbelievably more convenient than the original. Looks like I'll be heading over to bittorrent for this one."
1,"The game looks great, but EA kept me away","Like everyone else it seems I'll also not be buying this one. The terms of the install are simply too much to overlook. It's not uncommon for me to reinstall my operating system several times in a given year, which means I'd burn through my 3 install limit in no time.Very sad that the crippling protection was included in the final version. I had planned to build a new machine just to play this game. Now I have no intention of ever paying for it. EA, you really messed up."
1,DRM = FAIL,"If software companies want to battle piracy they need to find a way to do it without affecting their customers, or they will find they have no customers."
1,Spam DRM,"We've all heard it, DRM is the dumbest thing ever to be in a game. I don't know what EA was thinking but they just lost a customer/thousands of customers."
1,It's a shame...,"I bought and installed this game before knowing they had this blasted DRM software in it. Nowhere during the install did they let you know they were installing the SecuRom DRM that's always running and that's near impossible to remove w/o reformatting your drive. BAD EA. That's just plain underhanded.Now where's the respect for your customer's computer EA? I'm hearing that even if you uninstall Spore, you can't remove the DRM software. So until I reformat my hard drive I have to live with this malware running on my pc? There's enough security holes in Windows as is! BAD EA again!I'm giving the game 3 stars for fun. Would've been more, but knowing in the back of my mind all the luggage that came with the game, it drags the overall experience down. What happened to the good ol' days of buying a game and enjoying it for what it is, and not having to worry about big brother watching you while playing it?"
1,DRM = no go,"This game looked awesome, me and my fiancee were so excited to play it when it came out. Then I found out about the DRM. What can I say? My heart is broken - I love the look of this game but I refuse to bow to the man. Thanks for ruining what could have been the game of the year."
1,DRM = No way,What a shame.. I was really looking forward to this game... Will never buy a DRM'ed product as long as I can help it.
1,Opted to pirate,"I played the game some on a friend's computer, its not that bad; character customization is somewhat fun in the early stages; and its an easy waste of a few hours. i hear the later stages is where the real gameplay starts anyway.bad news is, i am not interested in purchasing the game with a limit of 3 installs; and thankfully the crack has been released already. Maxis; don't let EA publish your games..."
1,Not interested in DRM rent-ware.,"My son and I have been waiting for Spore for a long time! Now, we cannot play this on the same machine using our individual accounts without using up our activations. I regularly rebuild and upgrade my machines, at least annually, and I am simply not interested in dealing with DRM and activations. Windows activations between Boot Camp and VMWare are bad enough, I am not going to put up with ""renting"" a game that will install SecuROM."
1,DRM What???,"EA: Stop treating your customer like CRIMINALS. The ""digital rights management"" software included with this game makes it so that you can only install the game 3 times...then it stops working. So don't change operating systems, format your hard drive or upgrade your PC if you still want to play this game once it's been installed.On a separate note...Will Wright can take his ""genius"" elsewhere, this game's about as deep as a street puddle with about as much quality game-play as second rate Vegas casino."
1,DRM? I'll wait to purchase.,"A friend of mine from abroad had a long discussion on the game and it's rather outdated DRM tactics. I would gladly purchase this game in full including any future expansions, if they were to remove the pointless DRM service.Somehow I doubt this will ever prevent pirated versions from reaching the greater internet, but it will surely frustrate a valuable customer base and further spur anger in the more tech. savvy community.DRM is just a failed concept, I believe the term is ""defective by design"", it certainly fitting."
1,DRM = No Sale,I had been looking forward to this game all year. But I will not purchase until the DRM is removed. No Sale Here
1,another lost buyer,"I've been really looking forward to this game for a while, but after these helpful reviews and the DRM situation with EA, I'll definitely not be buying this game. This punishes the people the bought the game rather than 'piracy'."
1,Don't buy this game!!!,"Please tell EA their DRM is unacceptable!Don't buy this game.I made the mistake of pre-ordering the game before it was released.I won't ever do that again with another EA PC game!The game runs very slow because it installs spyware that activates on start-up.EA added a limit of three PC account limit similar to iTunes, but you have to have internet access to install and start the game each time.I installed the game on a laptop and tried to play the game where there wasn't any WiFi and wasn't even allowed to play the game I purchased!Beyond all of that, the game only has 5 levels which feel like 5 different arcade games thrown together. After 4 years in development, this game should have better quality. It looks very unpolished.Its a complete dissapointment!"
3,"A good ride, if a little incomplete","Let me begin by saying I'm a little surprised Amazon actually invited me to review Spore, all things considered. Yes, I am not at all a fan of the DRM placed on this game, and I feel that by forcing it on us, EA is going to make many gamers miss some pretty good titles.As for the game itself, its an enjoyable compilation of a number of concepts, and the replay value is very high. However, I feel like there was so much more that Spore could have done (and likely will, through paid expansions). The Space phase at the end is what the game is really about, with its sandbox elements and vast scope. The other phases in the game could have gone a lot farther, instead of being effectively tutorials for Space. That said, I recommend this game highly, and expect it will continue to improve."
1,How Sad,"I was really looking forward to this game -- enough so that I was going to purchase a new system just to play it. However, after hearing about the severe DRM that Electronic Arts decided to saddle the game with I can't, in good faith, purchase this product. Rather than treat me like a cherished customer I'm being treated like a potential criminal. This is really offensive! I'll be more than happy to purchase EA games when they decide to treat me with respect and un-DRM their software. Until then, no thanks."
1,"Just say ""No"" to DRM.","As others have stated, this game features a 3 install limit. I refuse to support any publisher that treats me like a thief after they've taken my $50.DRM only hurts paying customers. And I'll be happy to take my money and give it to StarDock, who doesn't pull these kinds of scams."
4,do not install,Great game but do not install from disk or serious malware will be installed. Buy your license from amazon then download a clean version from pirate bay. You'll be very sorry if you install from the EA disks. Love the game but hate the fact that you have to use only the pirate version.
1,Beware of Digital Restrictions Management,"While paying full price you only get limited activations and a forced installation of Securom.Another example of legitimate users getting the short end of the stick (and experience, since after 3 installations the easiest way to continue playing is to crack the game!)."
1,Please do not buy this game.,"This is a great game, don't get me wrong; Will Wright is a genius and Spore is the culmination of his greatest vision yet. But I don't want you to buy it. The reason is that EA and other companies like them must be sent a message, and refusing to buy their games, especially the high-profile ones, is the best way to get it across. Digital Restrictions Management schemes that could very easily remove the ability of the customer to play a game they have legitimately purchased while posing almost no difficulty whatsoever to pirates must stop. I'm not going to ask you to pirate this game or any other, but please, please do not buy it."
4,A True World of Wonders,This game is as good as it was predicted. You can do so much and your experience changes with each event you take place in. The world is at your fingertips and all you need to do is take control.
2,"The game is worthless, but the design tools are fun","I am extremely disappointed with this game. All five mini games are boring and extremely repetitive.However, the design tools are very fun to use. It is easy to waste hours designing creatures or vehicles.The game itself is a complete failure, but hopefully someone will license their engine and actually make a game worth playing."
2,All those years in development and still has serious bugs???,"I've been looking forward to this game for many years now, ever since hearing about it at GDC. I've played it now for 2 days and have run into three bugs, one is serious enough that I would have classified it as severity A. Upon starting the creature phase my nest spawned underwater. Every attempt to get onto land resulted in a big critter appearing out of nowhere and eating my creature. Had to restart to get around that. In addition to that I had an unhandled exception error when I closed it after playing the first session (this is on OS X). Finally, I've heard audio stuttering glitches. For a game that EA is touting as a franchise that will be a key part of their lineup for years to come you would have thought that they'd shaken all these out before shipping. Considering how long it was delayed, you'd really think that they'd have the time."
1,Played it once and uninstalled it.,"I played this game once through and experienced all their was to see. I thought this game would be like civilization but it was more like and overnight game. The games focus is all about custom user content and unique, yet simple, game play. It was interesting but I have buyers remorse. This game should have been $20 max. Also it has DRM protection with LIMITED installs. [....]"
1,DRM Crap,"Thanks to EA, to run this game I have to install virus DRM that won't let me reinstall it should I ever need to format my drive or upgrade my computer. It's useless and treats paying customers like a common criminal. It doesn't matter how fun the game is if you can't actually use it.Bad form."
1,DRM Sucks,I was fully intended to purchase this game and did until the dam DRM just ruined everything good about the game. DRM sucks EA needs to get their head on straight.
1,Disappointed,"I have been waiting a long time to buy this game and play it...It looks like a blast! Buuuuuut, because of the DRM I will not be purchasing it until EA removes it. DRM is ridiculous and I am not willing to pay $50 for a game that will be rendered useless after 3 activations. Ridiculous."
1,DRM sucks!!,"I bought this game and put it on my laptop but it did not play smooth so I installed it on my computer. I then had bought a new hard drive and OS for my computer so i formatted and reinstalled vista then SPORE was fine until I found out I hated Vista so back to XP I went, and wait now I can not play my game that I paid for.I have had it with DRM and refuse to buy any DRM games in the future.Stay away from DRM and Vote with your wallet!"
1,blah game,"this game doesn't deliver on the many promises made to gamers during its development. it is just a knockoff of five games in one. the first phase is just like the game flow. the second phase is a dumbed-down MMO. the third phase is a very simplistic RTS. the fourth phase is a real-time version of Civilization. the last phase is a lot like star control ii.evolution in this game is not driven by the engine at all; a player can just change his creature however he wants, with no repercussions. i was hoping for more realism.the game only lets you install it three times before ceasing to work. this is terrible DRM and i won't stand for it."
1,80$ coaster,"after buying the 79$ ""galatic version, I dioscover that EA thinks im a thief. How could I possible have the temerity to want to intall the game on my computer..btw: the drm broke my cd burner. I can no longer burn discs due to a ""system protection error:thanks, I needed that.. great game, fun and all that but DRM sucks and blows at the same time"
1,not with DRM,"I was just about to buy this game. I was very excited and had long awaited for its release. However, I will not install invasive software on my computer and I will not agree to abusive terms of service. What a disappointment."
1,No DRM,"I've been looking forward to this game for months, and had the money put aside for it. Seriously, I've been ready with cash literally in hand. Now that I read about the DRM, I will not buy it. Period."
1,"Great game, bad DRM","For those of you whining about how it's unfair for those of us who have not purchased the game and reviewing it for DRM, have you never heard of peaceful protest? Customers refused to tolerate DRM on music and it is slowly going away (in thanks to sites like Amazon who offer DRM free downloads for reasonable prices). If customers refuse to purchase a product due to DRM then so be it, it is our right to do so. I pre-ordered the expanded version of Spore and was looking forward to it but cancelled due to the DRM flack (for the record, I read about the DRM saga elsewhere about a month ago and cancelled my pre-order). I wonder how many sales EA is missing out on due to this problem? From the looks of it, I would say they are losing out on a significant amount of money now and every time they release an expansion pack for the game. Hope it hits the bottom line, hard. Maybe they will re-think the DRM next time out."
1,Good to see,"It is good to see people giving there honest reviews and saying what they feel. Although the game looks great I am one person who believes in protesting. If more and more people said ""NO"" and refused to buy games from EA and their counter productive measures Companies would realize they need to change their tactics. The fact is these companies know that no matter what they do people will continue to take it in the shorts and buy their games instead of protest it and say No we will not tolerate this.It's like anything keep feeding the virus and it will continue to grow bigger and stronger. Unfortunately EA has a bunch of great games under their name but I REFUSE to buy them and will buy from other game vendors ONLY. Anyone ever try to get ahold of EA by phone? I rest my case.Please review previous reviews in the same time frame to understand what my review is about with EA."
3,SecuRom DRM Can Be Uninstalled,"I think EA Spore is an OK game but like many others here, I dont like the instrusive DRM. I have read here in the comments that the ""SecuROM _cannot_ ever be uninstalled"" and that is NOT true. It can be uninstalled at any time though do understand that any application (like Spore) that uses SecuROM will rebuild these files and folders with future game launches/installs.SecuRom Official Uninstallhttp://www.securom.com/support/SecuROM_Uninstaller.zipPlease start the SecuROM Uninstaller tool with the parameter /fulluninstall, afterwards everything should be removed.Do It Yourself SecuRom Removal:http://isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=85806"
1,"Would not recommend for any audience - Spore is simplistic, shallow, unchallenging","Spore is simplistic, shallow, unchallenging (even on hard), and a massive disappointment.Easily the most disappointing game I have ever played. I have followed Maxis since SimCity for Nintendo and the PC. I've played almost every Maxis game ever released, and have personally purchased 5 copies of The Sims for myself and friends, not including the various expansion packs. This game simply doesn't compare.Other than the creature creator which is incredible, Spore is like playing the Sims with a prebuilt house you cant enter. Or SimCity with only residential zoning. It's simply incomplete and shallow."
1,"I got it! Yay... Opps, no Internet, no Play","As I'm sure many, many people have lamented, I too am a victim of EA's punishing the legitimate buyer while the hackers thumb their collective nose at them.I waited to install Spore on my laptop while I was at work. We're a little slow right now, so it was a perfect opportunity to bring in the laptop and play some Spore today. The installation went fine... Only one problem: I'm in a Wi-fi dead zone. Can I play Spore? NOPE. Nadda. Ain't going to happen.So, Thanks ever so much EA/Maxis: so nice to know that we can no longer use our $50 purchase when we really want to!!! Time to give up on Maxis and the Sim franchises? Sure seems like it to me."
1,EA sucks,I was going to buy this game today but I can't justify doing it because of the oppressive DRM system. I don't know if your listening EA but this kind of over reaction to piracy really puts a damper on my sympathy for game developers who are having games pirated. I think I'll just go buy a Stardock game instead because they show some respect for the average gamer.
1,"Interesting game, but not worth the $50 ""rental fee""","EA appears to have gone the way of Microsoft, however, unlike Microsoft (who will give you a fresh CD-Key once you use up your allotted Vista installs), EA only permits each CD-Key to be used for 3 installs. Reformat or buy a new computer 3 times and you will have to buy another copy of Spore.I don't understand what is so bad about the old system that remains in use by most, if not all online FPS games, where only one instance of each unique CD-Key can be run at a single time...I truly hope that EA loses more revenue from the bad Amazon reviews than they gained through their new ""anti-piracy initiative."" Keep it up and you can count on remaining in the red until bankruptcy is the only option, EA..."
1,A rather shabby experience,"It hangs my Windows XP installation, requiring a hard reboot. It hangs my Windows Vista installation, requiring a hard reboot. It won't run on my Macbook, which is less than a year old. It won't run under Parallels on my Macbook either. I can't install it anywhere else to see if I have a machine that will run it without hanging because of their DRM. Requests for support result in canned responses. If it was a better game I might work harder at it, but it is mediocre at best. A game that crashes is one thing. A game that takes your whole machine with it is another. It just isn't worth the trouble. I wish I had not spent the money."
3,Fun but with annoying limitations,"The game itself is great fun, but it's annoying that you can only get one account and only use it on one login per computer. My wife and I share a MacBook, and we'd much have preferred to be able to have each our own account and not have to switch to another login to be able to play."
1,DRM and alleged rootkit.,"It has frequently been said that people who don't like DRM don't like it because it prevents them from making illegal copies of a game or music. I don't like it because I don't like being treated like a thief. For the same reason that I won't buy gasoline from a gas station that makes you pre-pay, I won't be buying this game. I know I am not a pirate; I have scores of games that I've bought, over the years, including 4 full-copies of Diablo 2 (expansion and all) that I bought so that I could multiplayer a full party with my friends and family. As it is, DRM is killing video games. Frankly, there are other things I could do with my time.It really is sad too, because, as a biology student, I was really looking forward to playing it."
1,Do not believe the hype,"Here's a simple review without spoilers""Not as advertised""- Gameplay is limited. It's hard to change gameplay style (economic, military, religious) once the game picks it for you.- Evolving creature (multiple legs, etc) doesn't change the creature aside from the cool/cute value.- The space stage is repetitive. In-game automated preventative devices did not act without your intervention.- End game reward becomes useless after a point.- DRM is draconian. You are renting the game, not buying it.- Expansion packs will provide needed upgrades (more parts, enhanced gameplay) to improve playability.Despite same of the amusing aspects of the game, I returned it. It is not the game that was hyped over the last 2 years. It's a dumbed-down version of the hyped one. I believe some of the glitz was pushed to expansion packs."
1,Too Bad...,"I really, really wanted this game, but I'm not infecting my rig with Securom. EA only cares about money. Guess what? You won't be getting any of mine. Vote with your dollars people."
1,Did not work on my machine,"This game does not work properly on my Windows XP computer. I contacted tech support and was given the run around. One person even made vague accusations that I was pirating the game to friends (I was not, and would never do that). The game won't let me ""activate"" and also something the game installed messed up my ability to burn CDs. My main computer is now in for repair. I will not be risking another PC by installing this game. Buyer beware."
1,DRM will never work,"As a programmer myself, I feel it makes total sense that a company would want their assets protected and DRM provides this.I also strongly feel that deploying DRM is just wasted effort and time. It will only cause headache to only those who legitimately purchase software.Like the rest of the reviews, I will not be purchasing this product."
1,Do NOT buy this game you are only allowed 3 INSTALLS!,"It is a big shame that all of the time and effort of people and Will Wright is ruined because they only allow you to install the game literally 3 times. In today's world hard drives crash, and we have to reformat and reinstall all the time. Well this is a game that won't come with you because after 3 times, you're done, no more spore unless you buy another copy of the game. It is not smart to force people to only be able to install the game 3 times. This is a betrayal of the customer in every way. I am very very angry and will NEVER buy another EA product again until I can install my copy of my game that I legitimately buy. EA should follow stardock's example. hey make money and have no drm and they believe that if you buy something you can make as many copies of the game that you want for your personal use."
1,Securom makes it a waste to even bother with this game,"I'll admit, it's a fun game, and the content creator is one step shy of awesome. That said, due to the horrible DRM (Securom) and terrible activation system, it's not worth your while to even buy this game.I was having problems with my internet connection yesterday, and was sitting there with a box in my hand, and no game to play until later that evening when my service was restored. Due to the fact that the game was up on torrents almost a week before release, the devs should have some idea that their horrible DRM only hurts honest users. The pirates have been playing for a week, and I bet they didn't have to wait around with a box and no game as I did. I promise from here on out, that I will pass on ANY GAME from ANY MANUFACTURER that uses Securom... I don't care how cool the game is."
1,I sum my voice: No to DRM,"Thank you guys, I was going to buy this game, but instead I learned so much about DRM, after doing 2 days research, I decided to skip buying this game, at least until they patch out the DRM.So I sum my voice to the protest.By the way, I own 'SimCity 3000' and the original 'The Sims', I love both games, and still play them from time to time, that's why I thought that I would enjoy 'Spore', but I will not support DRM, sorry."
1,Drm = no purchase,"This kind of drm is the worst. I often format my computer and will have to reinstall this program, and with only 3 installs it makes this impossible to work with. The only kind of drm that I can tolerate is having to put cd in the drive and having to enter a serial number. No wonder so many people decide to 'obtain' games."
2,Too easy; no real depth,"I was looking forward to this game. I really, really was. It's been in development for what, like 10 years? I thought it'd be epic. Like, super-scale. But since it tries to juggle 5 different types of gameplay, they all end up being too easy. Instead of going in-depth into something, it's more like a bunch of tutorials. The most fun you'll have is the creature creator, which can be bought separately for 10 bucks. I don't really recommend this game to anyone that wants to really create a universe, because it's just not a ton of fun."
1,Sigh....DRM ruins this game's value,"So basically after putting this game on my laptop and my PC, I can only upgrade to a new computer one time before I will no longer be able to play this game.No thanks EA. When does Starcraft 2 come out? I'm sure Blizzard won't screw me. I'll save my $50 for them."
1,Please no more DRM!!,I am an avid gamer but I've been burned one time too many by DRM laden games that introduce low level system device drivers that later go on and cause system instabilities. These often linger despite the game being removed from the PC.I'd rather play games with my limited time than keep re-installing Windows.Nobody wants DRM.DRM = No sale for me.
1,Someone tell EA that paying customers are not criminals,"The hassles with install, DRM, and setup (download manager, etc...) make this game useless. I will never give EA money again for any product on any platform. These companies should not treat their customers with contempt."
1,"Too much hype, too much DRM","For almost 10 years, we've been told that Spore was going to be an ""evolution in gaming"". Sadly, it is no more than a revolution in dressing up magnetic dolls.Creatures do not adapt to their environment or situation. ""Changes"" are managed by snapping new pieces onto a creature. The user interface changes for each level. The game itself is a carpal tunnel inducing nightmare of clicking and trying to see around objects.Gameplay is simplistic and repetitive, and ultimately pointless, as the stats are all but meaningless at the last two ""stages"" of the game.The creation tools are fabulous, and are probably the best part of the entire game...which, ya know...kinda sad.The SecuROM DRM is absolutely unacceptable. There was no EULA or warning that I was installing this malicious and insanely difficult bit of stealth code into my registry. EA has decided to treat their customers like criminals, and as a result, I will boycott EA from this point forward."
2,Very simplistic gameplay ruins the fun -- boring after one play through,"I was expecting some level of strategy but virtually all aspects of the game are wholly simplified. A great disappointment once you realise the look of the creatures is the only amusing part of the game. I'm pretty sure a patch or add-ons would _not_ make the game better.On the issue of DRM, others say it better than I can. If the game was already cracked _before_ the game was released, DRM solely penalizes the folks who actually bought the game."
1,Great game that EA killed with DRM,"This game is great if you can overlook the fact that it puts the whole safety of your computer at risk, the fact that your renting it and that the pirates had it cracked before the rest of us got it. \I can't and i don't think anyone can. What really gets me is that it did nothing to slow piracy. With security its not if you should be asking but when. I payed EA 50 dollars to be treated like a pirate? No thanks.Great game ruined by EA yet again.Get the picture EA."
4,This game gets fun when you hit space,I will admit that when I hit the phase where I was running around with a tribe that I got a little bored. Thankfully I was able to get past that phase fairly quickly and get back to the business of evolving.I don't want to ruin it too much but the game takes off when you hit the space phase. Exploration is where it's at. I hope they add more to the other phases in upcoming patches.
4,Review of the game,Ok so I pre-ordered the game. I have alot of fun with this game. I enjoyed it so much I had my husband go get his own copy. The different levels are really fun it helps to have goals but you don't need to play in space one with goals. My only complaint and why it's 4 not 5 stars is the game keeps locking up while I play. I have to shut down my whole computer and reboot. Sucks this is a recent thing I played the first day for almost 6 hours straight. I play even night after I get off work for atleast 4-5 hours a night and it blows by supper fast. I love this game and hope to be playing it for years to come.
1,Absurd DRM - got to play it finally after 4 days!!!,Great game... when you're finally able to play it. EA has finally gone to far with their copy protection. Very disappointed...
1,DRM with activations? Never.,"I had a chance to play this game on a friend's PC. It's not worth the price of the rental. That's right, rental. You only get to install it 3 times."
1,Install problems,"My son is awfully disappointed, but this game is going back for a refund. Can't even get the thing loaded. Our PC, though not new, plays all our other games fine. Tried uninstalling and then reinstalling, tried calling Tech support and emailing questions, both a waste of time.No Thanks!!!"
1,No answers from EA on multiple accounts/DRM issue,"Contrary to the manual, you cannot have more than one account per game key code, so forget about sharing your game with anyone in your family. That is ridiculous enough, but there is no option to even create a second account on the same machine even if you have another code. People with more than one PC are no better off, they will need to buy two copies unless only one person plays on both. Oh, and you can only install it 3 times. Ever. If I were Will Wright I would quit EA/Maxis and start a new, privately owned company. I smell class action on this one, epsecially with the manual providing false information."
1,"Decent buy.. whoops nevermind, you don't really own it.","Spore is a decent game by itself. I like the concept, and gameplay is pretty good. That's about where this review will stop singing its praises (if you can call it that). EA Games implemented a tyrranical DRM scheme in Spore, which severely limits the ability to play the game. So when I bought this, I don't own it? I'm only ""renting"" it? This is absurd. I reformat my computer often, so 3 installs is pretty easy to blow through. EA punishes honest buyers by never letting customer's actually have control over the game they bought.So much for progress."
1,Boycott,"I was looking forward to playing this game, but after hearing about the DRM I am boycotting this game and will do the same on new EA titles. EA is only hurting and punishing the people who actually paid for the game and did the honest thing. I will not buy or play this game."
1,Came Here to Buy --- DRM Means No Buy,Came here to buy online. Read about DRM. Bad previous experience. No buy.PS. Heard the interview on NPR Science Friday and got excited. Would have bought even though some complaints about gameplay. Software companies need to hear the voice of the customer. Back to WOW or wait for Warcraft Online for me.
1,It probably won't work,"I had a somewhat advanced graphics card and it seemed like it was good enough from the back of the box. I install it and then it tells me that all of the sudden that it simply won't work and just lets me read a notepad instead. If you have a Gateway, and you've done nothing to it, it will not work, even though it probably could if they let it. Don't try to register on EA either because every sort of screen you make, no matter what it is, they say it's been taken and won't let you in."
1,How about a DRM scheme that's not totally awful?,"This is just more proof that EA doesn't have much creativity - they try to buy out other companies that have it, then run them into the ground (westwood, anybody?). So much for their new initiative to make their company more innovative... by including the most ridiculous and draconian DRM schemes? No thanks."
1,DRM mess advoid,Be very aware that this item had DRM and you are only renting the used of the game not buying it.
1,In no uncertain terms,"In no uncertain terms will I accept this kind of license from any company claiming to ""sell"" a game. You are basically paying money for an extremely flawed and one sided license. This game isn't for sale, it's not even for rent, it's basically up to EA's discretion for how long they want to keep it alive.When EA was done with several games they just shut down the activation servers and screw all the people that PURCHASED the game forever. These conditions are reprehensible. EA will never have the option of my business EVER again."
1,The turning point towards the downfall of PC Gaming,"Played the game at a friend's house, really cool stuff, but I refuse to pay for it until the rootkits and malware invasions of privacy that is Securom is removed for good."
1,"Bought the game, can't even play it. Bad DRM!","After waiting over a year to finally play this game, I am very disappointed. EA decided to put a strict DRM on the game and it basically locked my computer from playing this game. After being on hold with EA for nearly an hour, they determined that it was because of my video card drivers. I'm using video card drivers from Nvidia's website and apparently it wasn't good enough?I do not recommend this product."
1,Crashenator,"This game, even after the patches which came out right after its release, crashes at every opportunity. It is not a reliable game. It is not fun to play because when progress is achieved, it crashes (somehow it knows exactly when you plan to save and intervenes). Of course, it doesn't help that I can't play the game behind a firewall due to the connectivity required for DRM. The game has no additional value when connected to the internet, anyway."
1,The game is mediocre and the DRM is ridiculous,"Silly me, I didn't know about the DRM before I bought the game. So, now I'm stuck with a game that I can only install two more times before I have a $50 coaster. And, I'm planning on upgrading in the next couple of months, then it will be one more install. I sure do hope I don't have to wipe my system for any reason... Hooray for DRM. Thanks EA, and good luck getting me to buy another one of your games."
1,Okey But why this type of monkey thing.,That;s the toughest. Trying to see the monkey defacing the tribal wall.
5,The game is not about the DRM and the Limited activations,"Everyone is complaining about the DRM and the limited activation when the game is about spore. I thought the game was very well made and creative. Unlike most games this game can be played for endless amounts of hours with diffent things to do, create, and explore. I have over 100 creations and have played 20+ hours altogher on the game and I am still amazed at what there is to create and see in the game. Also even though there is limited activations why would you need to download it to multiple computer in one house. Finally itunes has a limited amount of activations for one account as well and there isn't nearly as much complaining about that as spore even though it is the same problem. I also can wait for Spore Galatic Adventures to come out, it will add even more possibilities to the game"
4,I dream about Spore,"I really love this game. I can't say much more than that. The depth in this game is phenomenal, and you can apply all the creativity you can muster to make your very own creation.Fantastic levels, all operating differently, essentially bringing 5 games into the one. Each game is able to be played by themself, or concurrently - and I swear I am so addicted to this game that when I wake up in the mornings I can see Spore creations dancing in front of my eyes.There are some downfalls - there appear to be problems with operating on a Mac - and many people are upset over this. I understand where they're coming from, Spore is touted to be Mac friendly - however I am way to much in love to have this ruin our relationship. I'll be installing Windows on my Mac just so I can play, whilst I wait for EA to come up with a fix for the Mac.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves their life sims, or their creation sims."
1,A real shame,"This could have been a great game, but was really hurt by an absolutely ridiculous DRM scheme, not to mention it doesn't come close to living up to the hype that surrounded it.The most important thing to look at here is I have no intention of shelling out $50 for what is basically a rental. If the activation servers have a problem or if I upgrade my computer to much or reformat it, I'm in trouble.I am glad we are sending a message to EA and letting them know we're not going to take this. We gamers deserve a company that doesn't treat us like thieves. Hopefully the awareness we are raising about this DRM issue will let them know how serious we are about this.I looked forward to this game for a long, long time. Lots of my friends did as well. We're not going to support EA however by buying it while they continue to treat us like this."
1,Thanks but no thanks,"I was about to buy this but I saw the all reviews about the game's DRM. I don't really need any rootkits on my PC, so no thanks."
1,"As per usual, less delivered than promised","Not to mention the DRM...Besides the DRM, this game was designed to not work with laptops, so it's a hard time controlling the Tribe stage."
1,bloated game with little fun,"it would be one thing if the long wait for this game was because of revolutinary gameplay but everything about this is so average, from the graphics to the management. I literally fell asleep at the computer.I also would not recomend this game for anyone that is a computer hobbyist, with the drm it makes it impossibl to do fresh installs.btw, those that say you don't actually own games according to the license, well that is bs, with games on consoles you can buy, sell , and trade the games you buy on ebay or ebworld, not this one. infuriating."
1,Genereic RTS,"Skipping the horrible DRM issues (which are enough to warrant the game a score of zero) what we have here is a generic RTS game.Forget any ideas of evolution or discovery. Nothing you do in the cell and amazingly dull creature stages as ANY effect on the game, since you can totally redesign your creature at any point during these stages, and right before the Tribal stage.As soon as you get to the tribal stage, the first thing you are told is to drag the mouse to select multiple units, click on resources to star gathering them, then click on your town hall to start building things.... ah, so original... all hype, no substance.I was amazed seeing the review here on Amazon, I don't think any product has ever earned such a massively negative backlash. It is well deserved, on so many levels."
1,Doesn't run on multi-GPU computers,"I was so excited to play this, but apparently it's not designed to run on the newer multi-GPU machines. My nVidia 9800 GX2 video card brought up an error message asking me to update my drivers. I updated my drivers as it requested, but it didn't help. If you have a multi-GPU machine, don't buy this. I even tried it on my older multi-GPU machine with the same results."
1,"Great game, not so great DRM","I was really looking forward to purchasing Spore, but EA's decision to use securom DRM convinced me to save my money."
1,DRM Ruined it,"I had been looking forward to this game for years, but the SecuROM DRM totally ruined it for me. Not only are the limited activations annoying, but the game won't even run if you run the standard Microsoft utility Process Explorer, which I use all the time.It is only worth installing if you plan on installing it on a dedicated machine that will never need to be reinstalled or reactivated. In other words, don't mess with it.Hopefully this is the last SecuROM train-wreck that gets released. I really miss playing games on my PC. Maybe I can find a cracked version somewhere so I can get my money's worth. SecuROM makes pirates. It is almost malware."
1,"Lose the DRM, or lose your paying customers","Looking forward to playing this game. However, I won't pay for a product that is so crippled by DRM. I feel bad for the developers being so very punished for EA's poor decisions, as I'm sure this game is quite fun."
1,DRM != Ownership,"I won't buy it.DRM makes otherwise innocent people criminals before the law (at least while the DMCA is still on the books).Because the DRM scheme has been shown to be ineffective (read: already cracked) the only thing it is good for now is upsetting paying customers.Good job EA. To your stockholders: sell. The RIAA is starting to learn, as will EA that making criminals of your customers is not an effective long term business strategy."
1,DRM is ineffective,"This new DRM EA has started using on it's products (including Spore) only allows a maximum of 3 installs.If you pay $50 for a game, you deserve to actually OWN the game. DRM does not work. While honest people are paying for gimped games, pirates just download them for free. If anything, this has made more people illegally download Spore because they're tired of the horrible DRM."
1,DRM is horrable,I went through the same hassle with mass effects I will NOT do it again. I work on computers for a living and end up switching hard drives and other components as well as reformatting my PC very often. Calling EA is a huge hassle I WILL not pay 60$ for a video game just to be treated like a pirate because I choose to replace my computer components or reload my OS.
3,Overhyped,"I picked it up in the bargain bin having heard much hype.Like everyone else I don't like the DRM, but this is not why I am rating the game low.This game has nice graphics and doesn't crash, and it works on both Mac and PC.However, I found it extremely boring. It is oversimplified and extremely repetitive.The amoeba stage lacks any challenge. The creature stage lacks any purpose. The RTS stage is so simple that it does not come anywhere close to real RTSs like Starcraft.Civilization stage is so bad that this is where I gave up (go buy Civ 3 for $5 if you want to do some civilization building).I want to think that maybe the last stage is the really good one, but I got bored before I reached it..."
1,Completely dumbed down and cartoony,"Far far far from the original concept and vision of the game. Completely dumbed down and linear, creature creator is only good for asthetics and doesnt effect anything else other then body part attributes (shape doesnt matter).BAD!"
3,Starts fun but later looses momentum,"As soon as i started playing Spore i found the innovative game design very unique, also it was fun to have a part in changing the evolution of a species. However I soon found the game to become unappealing, for all the parts of the evolution are somewhat there unique game, they are all just sort of shallow. For example later on in the game, the gameplay will be like that of an RTS, but there will not be much to do."
1,Fun game but functionality sucks,"This game is a lot of fun. However, there are two major problems:1. DRM- I'm not a fan of this. I paid for the game, I should own the game. Stop treating paying customers like they're stealing.2. There is no auto save function. I hate it when I've been playing for an hour and the game crashes. There went an hour of work.If EA would fix these issues I'd give it a 5 star rating. Till then One star it is. As much fun as it is to play, I wouldn't buy this again or I would return it if I could."
1,Epic DRM Fail.,"I have yet to see a DRM worse than the one included with this game. I mean, it is incredibly awesome for EA, because it makes people who buy it have to buy it again if they reinstall Window$ a few times or have any hardware failures.. Perhaps everyone should buy this game just to help EA out?"
1,Another lost sale.,"I was planning to buy this one, it looks fun. I refuse to pay for something that attacks my OS though. Typically, as with most DRM and all those anti piracy warnings on DVDs (etc), it only affects actual paying customers negatively.Maybe they should go back to hardware dongles for games - I didn't really have an issue with those."
1,Spore could have been so good....,"People listen, you do not want this DRM spyware/malware on your machine. just read all these reviews, people wouldnt take the time to make accounts and post this stuff unless there was a good reason for it.So will it crash your operating system? YES it could.Will it stop working after you payed 50$, YES it will.Will they use your internet connection without you knowing it to track your habits? YES they will.SO seriously Do Not Buy This Game."
1,EA Games Digital Rights Management,"The DRM on this game is absolutely ridiculous, limiting it to three installs has to be one of the worst ideas that I have ever heard. I was very excited about this game, but I will not purchase it because of sheer the principle of it, I refuse to support Electronic Arts and their ridiculous anti-piracy limits."
1,Count out another...,"When the pirated version of a game is less detrimental to your system health than the officially sanctioned version, something is wrong.Consider this a signed note of protest for all companies who are considering the same DRM-scheme."
1,Can't use it--viral DRM,I use my computer for business as well (banking) and can't install the game due to the DRM system employed. Not quite as bad as a rootkit but a risk I can't accept
1,DRM Has no place in a modern title,"Having had to keep a CD or DVD on hand for other titles when the game requires it, hunting on your desk for the box or case or slip tends to take alot of fun out of the entire game process.Whilst the concept and the look of Spore is fantastic the DRM/Copy protection scheme belongs on a title 10 years ago, and even then the process of swapping discs really wore thin, not to mention the damage to drives and the discs with constantly swapping discs in and out (who has a optical drive thats dedicated to every title they own? Not me!)I cannot recommend this game for this reason, best to hold off until they release a more sensible version thats more in favor of the users sanity."
1,DRM is just as stupid in games as it is in music,I wonder if companies like EA will ever get the message that they are treating their paying customers like criminals while doing NOTHING to stop the piracy they pretend to be so concerned about. Ideas like SecureROM belong in the deepest darkest pits of hell.
1,"Oh please, keep telling me what I can't do with my game...","Yes, you've heard, but I'll reiterate... the DRM is way overboard. Three installs, which is perfectly normal WITHOUT any sort of piracy happening, from a game I'd hope to play for years...Painful. I'm not happy."
1,DRM? Not buying,I had been waiting for this game for well over a year. Not going to buy it until they fix the DRM and spyware.
1,This game has everything that made me leave Windows,"I was so excited about this upcoming game, having loved pretty much every piece of software from this programmer. And now, it's here with a major disappointment: DRM.The reason I went for a Mac is because there, you are generally not treated like a criminal with activation hassles and DRM (I reward this by buying family licenses when available even though I'm a single household). But this game does have activation and DRM. Aside from not being able to play it while travelling (no CD drive in my MBA), I wonder why pirates can get a hassle free version for no pay where as I have to pay for the 'privilege' of coping with DRM.The company is sending the wrong signal...a very sad way of ruining a perfectly good game."
1,DRM = BAD,Putting in a draconian drm system to punish the gamers who want to legally purchase your game is a very bad plan.
1,Contact information for EA,"I am returning my product, unopened, as defective since it is loaded with the SecureROM DRM and activation limit. For those of you who want to email someone that your complaints matter to, here are the emails of the PR for EA.EA Partners, EALA & Blueprint (Spore, LMNO, Red Alert 3, Mercenaries 2, Rock Band, Crysis, Left 4 Dead, RAGE)* Bryce Baer, Director (bbaer@ea.com)* Amanda Taggart, Manager (ataggart@ea.com)* Nikki Flynn, Publicist (nflynn@ea.com)* Andrew Wong, Manager (anwong@ea.com)* Devin Bennett, Senior Publicist (devinb@ea.com)"
1,Install from H*ll,"I had better luck installing Vista than this game. I should have known that it would be a pain since EA was in charge. Okay I didn't really have better luck installing Vista, it was about the same."
1,DRM madness,"Game is great... that aside this is strickly to comment that EAs fascist, capitalist crap needs to stop! The piratees aren't even fazed by their feeble attempts, this hurts the casual gamer who is trying to enjoy a game-- oopps system crash, wait a minute already installed 3 times!... I got hosed!"
1,I only buy games that I own afterwards,"Both me and my son were looking forward to Spore, since the idea sounded interesting. Once I've heard about the DRM we decided to keep our money. Here is our message to EA:We will not give you a single cent for any product that limits the number of times we can install it."
1,a new definition for crap,so bought spore. i tried to install it on one of my computers offline. it says it cant start because it isn't connected to the internet. couldn't you register it with a phone or something? and whats with this only three installs? well its more like renting it than buying it. dont buy
1,DRM shackles,"This game is alright, I was expecting alot more. Still a fun game to play. But this DRM is rediculous. I wish EA would understand that the more they try to control an intangible product the more people are going to take control themselves. I wouldn't be surprised if we could keep a record of how many people recorded pirated this game and find that it is the most pirated game yet.Sorry Will, but if you work for the devil I'm pretty sure that makes you evil (at least a little bit)."
1,BOORRIINNNGGG!!,"Ok so I played spore for a grand total of about 10 hours. I got to the (I think) final stage which was trying to conquer the galaxy. I just couldn't handle it anymore I wanted to keep going and conquer all but I was so bored of it by that point I just wanted to quit and never come back to it again. It has a great idea, just really lame gameplay. I just got so annoyed.There I said it.Oh and I can't uninstall it and try again in the future for fear I might not be able to use it again. What a waste of money. EA has definitely gone downhill. They just don't care about their customer or listen to them at all. I am avoiding EA like the plague"
2,DRM aside - Spore stinks,"This game is tedious. Forget about the DRM, there is no way you'd ever feel a need to install this junk more than once. The creature creator is fantastic but the game play is just derivative and dull. Great idea just very badly implemented. Will Wright should stick to classic sim games."
1,Made for expansion packs,This game could have been awesome....but ea wants to sell expansion packs so in its current state its a broken game. If Will Wright wants to make the games that he wants to make then he should leave the strangle hold of EA and start his own company. After about 100 dollars of expansions this may turn out to be a good game. Also the DRM is excessive and untra restrictive. I make some kind of upgrade every once in a while so I am wondering how long I can actually play this game untill I am locked out. I gues EA thinks that your not purchasing the game but renting it for an extended period of time. If you want to support publishers releasing unfinished games and slapping a huge drm on you then pleas buy this game like this moron here.
4,Very good game.,"While it lacks some detail and depth in a few of the stages, the overall polish of the game makes up for it. The creature designer is fun and easy to use, but I suggest studying someone else's design to get the placing of legs and spine right.I have only played to the beginning of the Tribal stage, so I can't base my review on anything else. I don't see why so many others are giving it low stars, I adjusted my view of the game years ago when they took out the highly detailed sure to be Mature gameplay. If they ever add that to a sequel or expansion it could go down as one of the best of all time.This game should run on your computer, so give it a shot and play a great game."
1,WTF!? - When will you people get it?,"When will you people get it? You are LOOSING money with DRM! If I can't download something because of DRM it doesn't mean I'm going to buy it - I'll just do without or get it from somewhere else! - I think in general people don't have a problem with paying for something, be it music, movies or games, they just prefer downloading it rather than having to drive to a store to get it, why not just provide a PAYED digital download service (with no DRM!) that even has a discount as you don't have to pay for shipment, packaging, store markup etc - incentives certainly aren't BAD for marketing! Certainly in the case of SPORE, DRM was a HUGE mistake - this is a fantastic product which I'm sure alot of people would have happily handed over their $$$ for - I WAS one of them till I found out about the DRM - I'm no market analyst but this is just common sense - who the hell is making these decisions!!??"
1,Please watch out,"Be careful. This game will not work if you have computer trouble.If you need to repair or replace your computer 3 times after buying this program, it will NOT allow you to play it.Wait till they fix this before you buy. Or buy another game for now."
1,What a terrible shame,"I have been looking forward to this game for years, and I would have bought it even with the mediocre gameplay simply because I understand how people can be disappointed in a game after hearing so much hype. However, like so many others, I will not submit to these asinine DRM schemes anymore. I'm done. I was done after trying to help a friend get Bioshock installed and running last year.I'm not going to go pirate Spore, but I can certainly understand why some people would - it's just less hassle. EA, and all other publishers that insist on these insane DRM schemes need to wake up and smell the coffee. People are just getting tired of dealing with it, and it is really starting to hurt the PC gaming scene. I don't mind having to have an original disc in the drive to play - that is the accepted standard in my mind. Why go any further than that?"
1,DRM is a no go,"This game was just too lacking, I was expecting a lot of content in this game. Going a single cell, to being on land was just very awkward in terms of game play. Knowing EA they well be releasing tons of expansions of content that should have been in the game to begin with. I got to the last stage with in a day of play. So not worth the money.Plus I will not install any programs that have a DRM in it."
5,Play the game and quit whinning about DRM,"I have only played for a couple of hours but I am finding the game enjoyable. If you problem with game is DRM, stop being disingenuous about your rating and contact EA."
5,Spore is Great!,"Spore is a really fun game, and you shouldnt judge it unless you've played it. It's really creative and actually pretty deep once you get further in the game."
1,"EA, Stop punishing honest customers","After reading about this game for a couple years and following its progression I have to say that I am horribly disappointed in EAs decision to implement what amounts to a $50 game rental. I was excited and ready to buy it. Thanks to the reviews here, I'm going to pass it over.While people who illegally pirate the game are enjoying fully unrestricted gameplay, EA decides to punish their honest customers with a 3 installation limit."
1,Down with DRM,"I would have purchased if it weren't for two things:1.) It does support macbooks that are more than seven or eight months old - it depends which graphics chipset model you have. GMA 950? Sorry, you're screwed.2.) I'd run it on my windows machine, but DRM! To hell with DRM. This is completely unacceptable."
1,Crippled by DRM,"This product would be great, if it wasnt for the fact it has the possibility of ruining your PC!"
1,"Mediocre gameplay, hate the DRM","I've played Spore for 30 hours now and I'm already looking to move on. Unfortunately this game doesn't have very much depth in it's game play. It's far too simplistic for the average gamer.It's a sad sad day when you have to consider the DRM used in a game before purchasing it. To be blunt the DRM in Spore sucks and only limits you to 3 installs. This wouldn't be so bad if I could uninstall the game and get a install back but I resent having to call EA support and prove to them I bought the game legally at sometime in the future when I purchase new hardware.With this disappointment I'm done pre-ordering games from EA. In the future I'll wait until the game is released and then see if it warrants purchase. One thing is for certain, if it has a ridiculous DRM scheme that basically only lets you to lease your purchase then I'll keep my money. Maybe if EA's revenues start slipping they might come to their senses."
1,game got wasted with DRM,If DRM was bad on music and movies. They are far worst on PC games. I was playing Commandos yesterday on my laptop I purchase that game over 7 years ago and have played it in more than 10 pc but with EA DRM on Spores that will never happen because when I upgrade or even update my system I won't be able to use it anymore. DRM SUCKS
1,DRM not compatible with Microsoft File Monitor,"Just so you all know, the DRM in the game prevents it from running if you've run Microsoft File Monitor on your system previously. It doesn't matter if you've closed the program... Even if File Monitor is not running at the time you want to play the game, even if you uninstall file monitor.The only solution is to restart your computer every time you want to play Spore, and because of this EA refuses to give a refund because the ""restart every time you want to play"" is what they consider an adequate workaround.Brilliant.I'm giving away my copy to a friend so that they won't buy the game. If EA won't give me a refund, I'm definitely going to try to cut into their profits as much as I can. For everybody else who is as frustrated as I am, instead of stabbing knives through your Spore DVD, I'd recommend giving it to a friend who might be at risk of paying for it."
1,Creature creation doesn't really matter,"Creature creation and variation only seems to matter to a point. Adding on an extra set of legs doesn't seem to add speed. More feet/hands doesn't seem to stack their effects. More eyes, doesn't allow you to see farther. etc etc etc...Only seems to matter on appearance. No gameplay difference. Nothing stacks.I haven't seen the point to adding ears to my creature. Does it do anything?Doesn't seem to be much point to replaying, either. Once you do a stage, there are only 2 other paths you can take and it basically boils down to whether you made the other tribes/civs your allies, destroyed them, or did a combination of both. Not much replay value.Avoid this game. Why can't games live up to the original vision?"
1,they got me,"I bought this game the day it came out not knowing about the DRM issue, I regret my purchase now so much. I should have just torrented it."
1,DRM is bad for you,"You can only install this game 3 times. I have 2 computers and have had to reformat one of them in the past year. This means I would have to live in constant fear of one of my computers dying again (or go through the rigamarole of trying to convince the all-holy EA that I do in fact need to install their game again).I don't want to rent this game until I happen to hit an arbitrary number of installs.And for all you ""cheap"" shoppers out there. Do NOT buy this game used. Who knows if it even has any installs left?"
1,DRM no way!,I was ready and set to purchase this game till i found out about the DRM. I build computers and am constantly upgrading my system. There is no way i am going to be begging EA for a new activation code every time i put more RAM in or upgrade my graphics card. I was really excited for this game too but now i'm just a little depressed i'll never get to play it. There is no way i'll ever put that DRM on my computer! I hope everyone else i know will join me in banning EA till the DRMs are lifted. Till then i guess i'll be buying games from other gaming companies sorry EA but other companies don't treat their customers like this.
1,DRM denies me ownership,"Because of the copy protection scheme Electronic Arts has placed on this game, which requires online activation before the purchased product will begin to work, there is no guarantee that a piece of software I have honestly purchased will ever work for me. EA does not have to maintain the activation servers for any particular length of time. Should they ever go out of business or simply decide it is no longer profitable for them to maintain said servers, ever single purchased copy of the game will become instantly and irrevocably broken.I cannot support a company which will not recognize that my purchase of their product should transfer ownership. I want to own games I purchase, and I do not want the publisher to intentionally install ways for the games to break."
1,Disappointment,I was going to buy until I found out about DRM.Another $50.00 bites the dust EA.Enjoy your game
1,DRM ruined it.,"I am SO glad I haven't bought this game yet! Thank you everyone for the heads-up about this DRM mess. I feel like I dodged a bullet.I might still buy it if they fix the DRM. But as a customer of many EA products, I'm offended that I'm being treated like a criminal.I don't want more DRM junk in my computer."
1,The DRM is more challenging than the game itself,"In fact, while the game itself is a bit frustrating, if you want a real challenge, deal with the DRM!Even if there was a DRM-free version, I'd say it's still worth a pass. This is one spore that should die."
1,DRM go away,"I never played this game, and I was very eager to buy it. But I'm not gonna spend any of my hard earned money to this product until the moment EA removes their STUPID DRM practices. Very good way to lose. Oh I was thinking about buying the new soccer game from EA, but I guess it's not a right time to do it either. EA is going from bad to worse everyday.Buy != Rent..."
1,Big Brother Strike Again,"I was really looking forward to 'Spore'. I had been reading about this for over a year now. I had seen the preview videos and thought that this looked like a fun, engaging game to play. And once again....corporate greed and mismanagement have ruined the day! I refuse to buy a a game that I do not have the right to install or uninstall as many times as I feel is necessary on MY OWN PC!!! I understand copy protection....I do not understand this 1984-esque interference in my product ownership. Using SecuRom beyond that was one of the worst ideas EA ever thought up. This is like buying a car and being told I can only make three modifications to it before contacting the manufacturer and asking permission to add new rims or something. Total garbage. Anyway....thats my two cents. EA....you wont recieve my $50 until you change your copyrighting schema."
1,Failure,"The DRM alone is reason enough to not buy this game. It's reasonably fun, but people should own what they purchase."
1,DRM.....,EA killed this game with really bad DRM. Really? 3 Installs? EA has to realize that people who PAY for their games shouldn't be punished. Because people who just GET IT from elsewhere does not have to deal with any kind of DRM. Don't buy this game until they fix the DRM issues.
1,The customer service for EA is nonexistent,"We lost our registration code for this game. The game would not work on our first computer. Needless to say when we got a new computer and needed to reinstall it, we couldn't find the number and you can't install it without. It was a [...] game that my son never got to play. YOu can't email the company and there is no 800 number. Do not waste your money on this!!!"
1,DRM killed Spore!,"I'd give this game a minus three stars if I could. The Digital Rights Management on this game (ie: DRM or copy protection) is outrageous! Its one thing to protect your copyright, its something else again to punish the consumer for buying your product! Save your money."
1,DRM? Only one problem with this game,"I'm sure by now you've read a few of the other reviews and heard about how terrible the DRM on this game is.But there are other reasons to avoid this game. Most importantly, after two years of hype and anticipation, this game is not as revolutionary as it could have been.There are issues with bugs, hassles built into the gameplay experience, and the main focus of the game, the space section, is just one repetitive grind fest.Take my advice.Don't buy this game."
1,DRM is a cancer,And there can be no question that the DRM ridden Spore has a terminal case.What was EA thinking? Obviously nothing. If this is the future of PC gaming - PC gaming is dead.
1,DRM - Kind of like gun control laws,"So if you really want to play spore, pay the $50, throw the cd you get in your drawer and download the version where you can get around the DRM, then slap Will Wright.All the DRM does is make it harder on the legit users. There are already cracked copies out there for people who were never going to pay for it anyways.When are media companies going to learn that they need to pick a new direction with media piracy protection. For once try to work WITH your consumers in creating a protection that both sides can work with. Or ignore us and lose our support.(Glad to be 1 of thousands sounding off against DRM here)"
1,Seriously?,"DRM, are you effing kidding me? Oops, I hope Amazon doesn't mysteriously wipe out all the comments on here like they did on amazon.co.uk. There is no packaged US release in which this particular turd is disabled, so it is a compulsory part of the game. In other words: the DRM is part of the software as it is sold, so it is perfectly valid to give this game an abysmal review based on it's inclusion.After being screwed out of ten bucks for an extra copy of the creature creator that I didn't want, I thought I couldn't be any more angry with this company. I was apparently wrong. What a way to ruin the most anticipated game of the decade EA. You guys are seriously a gaggle of clueless suits and your pathetic schemes are going to fail miserably.In the interest of keeping the rest of us happy, can you go ahead and fail a little faster so that a fitter company can take your market share? This game is terrible. Your ethics are terrible. Your company is terrible.Thanks for nothing,--Joe"
4,"Incredible game, the first time through.","OVERALL, this game is indeed a classic. I had an amazing time playing through the first time, got my moneys worth for sure.Car, plane, boat, creature, and building creation options are not infinite, but no way near restricted. A little imagination takes you a long way with this game. Most of the fun comes from watching your creation in the ""real world"" as game play elements are a little repetitive the second time through.If you take your time and milk the game for all its worth, rather than rushing to the end, it is well worth the money and a gaming experience you will not forget.After a short break, its always fun playing a new creation through.If your into creative imagination oriented gaming, I recommend this game as well as Garry's Mod for Half Life 2, and every ""sim"" and ""sims"" game ever."
1,"Was planning on buying, not anymore.","I was planning on buying this game until I saw these reviews. Wow, way to screw up, EA! By having this RIDICULOUS DRM system, you're not preventing pirating, you're only pissing off all the people that are completely WILLING to buy the game LEGALLY!When are the big corporations going to get the hint? I will not pay a penny for a game with DRM as ridiculous as that on Spore. I'm glad everyone is taking a stand. Hopefully EA will have a big loss this quarter and they'll get the message."
1,Spore - would buy if the makers didn't think I was a criminal,"I would love to buy spore, however a) I have no guarantee I will be able to play my game if their servers go offline (look at Microsoft's playsforsure, or yahoo music, where people were ripped off by DRM schemes), and b) their terms of service and EULA essentially call me a criminal simply by installing. I hope the DRM included kills this game out of the gate to be honest, then eventually you publishing houses will realize that treating your customers like criminals will only alienate them. I will never purchase it. Period."
1,"Stupid enough to order it, but now im returning it","3 installs? I'll be returning this product. I'm out shipping on the return, but it beats a $50 coaster. EA is idiotic, the game is being pirated already. All they're doing is punishing the people who actually buy their game, which hasn't lived up to the hype anyway."
1,Not worth the time - DRM is part of the problem,"The DRM by itself is enough to make it a no buy, as there is no reason for a game to REQUIRE you to verify so often. Not everyone wants their games to phone home and give them any information (and do you know what it is sending?). Other than that, too much hype, not enough fun. Perfect example of spending more on marketing than on development."
1,DRM + Bugs = A terrible experience,"For the most part, the game is an interesting concept. However, like so many awesome concepts before it, Spore fails for several reasons. First, the aforementioned DRM which limits your machine to a rental and leaves you at the mercy of EA (fantastic...). Secondly, the one facet that really ended it for me was this: During the tribal stage, I told my primates to attack an enemy tribe, and they all stopped at an invisible wall on the hill between myself and them, except one who went into the enemy camp and was slaughtered. What is wrong with developers that they think that this is acceptable? This product is not worth $20, let alone $45."
1,Mediocre At Best--But Ruined by DRM,"I agree with most previous posts citing DRM drawbacks. Because of its DRM, this makes the game an expensive rental. I was so hyped up for this game too. Mind you, I'm not panning only based on the stupid DRM--but also on the ""meh"" playability.EA used to be such a good company too (talking 80's here!)."
4,"Yes, the DRM sucks, but it's a cool game","The DRM sucks. Ok, all the trolls out there should be satisfied.As far as a game goes? It's pretty cool. Like most of Will Wright's games, it's more about tinkering and creating a creature than about compelling gameplay. The graphics are beautiful, and the entire Spore universe is charming.For those of you hoping that it follows the laws of natural selection and evolution (as I did), prepare to be somewhat disappointed. There are large jumps in the evolutionary process, there is relatively little penalty for dying, and changes occur due to ""hey! you discovered a new trait!"" rather than a random accumulation of mutations (though it could be argued that the whole discovery thing is just a metaphor for this).It's beautiful. It's charming. I felt it was worth it, especially since I've been waiting three damn years for this game to be released.But yes, the DRM sucks."
1,I'm not a pirate,I won't be treated like a pirate. I won't have it assumed I'm gonna cheat. I won't support a company that doesn't actually sell me what I'm buying.DRM means no purchase. Ever.
1,Disappointed to see all these comments,"I have many EA games (I am still playing NBA Live 2K4 daily) and i am disappointed to see that they have stooped to this level. Activation was a main hate of people when XP came out and for some unknown reason it looks like EA has followed suit.Dont these company realised that DRM annoys legitimate users?All it does is make people want to rage against the machine and use an illegal copy. I am sure that some trusty hacker out there is already coming up with a solution to fool the program. I do hope so, because i dont know if i would ever buy another EA game if this isnt stopped."
1,DRM = Take THAT legitimate customers,Review title pretty much says it all. Want to be punished for legally buying a game while the pirates play without any of this DRM? Then buy this game!
1,supporting the Cause.,Supporting the cause of the DRM crowd. EA has no right to run this kind of program on our computers. I will not be buying it until its removed from the game entirely.
3,"Good game, Bad DRM","This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. It has intuitive controls and a wide variety of ways to play it.One really negative aspect was that, because of the DRM, my 3 year old DVD drive wouldn't read the disk properly causing the install to fail."
1,"Great game, terrible that it's ruined by security precautions","This looks like a fantastic game, but unfortunately there's some extra security precaution software that installs itself alongside the game. There is no way to completely remove it without reformatting.It also only lets you install 3 times. If need to install over 3 times (like if you discovered the precaution software in the background, uninstalled, then reinstalled noticing the precaution software won't go away, then reformatted to get rid of it, then reinstalled trying to avoid the precaution software) then you find you must contact EA to let you play the game you bought.No company should treat its customers like thieves, it saddens me that it has to be this way."
1,"Problems, i had a lot of issues, do not buy this game.","I have a very good computer, but i had a lot of trouble installing the game and making it work, because of the DRM and all the bad malicious software it installs !I have returned the game to the shop.Do not buy it. It causes problem !!i am really disapointed!"
1,"Last-second change of mind, not buying this game.","Wow,just wow! This game looks like so much fun, but DRM sure doesn't. I came here to buy the game, but I upgrade various parts of my computer all the time, so this is an easy decision for me...NO WAY. I've already had the headache of reactivating Windows because of changes to my computer, I'm not about to go through that for a game!And to think DRM is supposed to be ANTI-piracy. Seems more like PRO-piracy to me."
1,got nailed by EA's DRM,"well, what not to love. the game itself, sure, it's fun, but securom's an infection that the game itself does not need.99% of people won't notice the little DRM blighter, but the 1% of people that get hit, won't like the dramatic authoritarian rigmarole needed to go through in order to play the game if DRM locks up. I'm starting to hate EA like i hate Steam because of the draconian DRM policies that i'm forced to adopt just to play a game, and it sucks."
1,DRM is out of control,I really was looking forward to buying this game. But the DRM that the publisher has decided to use is just too much. I keep games forever so the three install limit and online authentication is a real problem for me. I buy a lot of games but I won't be buying this one.I recently purchased a low spec ultra portable and dipped in to my extensive game archive to load it up with low spec older games like Starcraft and Diablo. This would not be possible probably with this type of DRM on Spore as they will likely have shut down the authentication servers 10 years from now. This is more like a rental.And the really shameful thing is that if I wanted to pirate it it would be simple to do as it is widely available as are all games people want to pirate. They have only succeeded in punishing the paying customer for NOT pirating the game.
1,Won't buy because of DRM,"I was excited about this game. I actually bought the creature creator and spent quite a bit of time honing my design skills with it.I was concerned that the creature design would have little effect on game play, and several reviews here confirm this. But I would have bought the game anyway, just for the joy of cruising around a user-designed galaxy, collecting specimens.But the oppressive DRM is the nail in the coffin. I've purchased every game I've ever played. I have lost money to DRM, and I don't need Spore, so I'm not going to buy it. DRM is for games that won't be successful in the long term - the kind of games that need to sell out in the first week to maximize profits, because no one will buy them after the reviews get wide exposure."
1,DRM is a dealbreaker,"I've been looking forward to Spore since I first heard the concept. Sadly, the intrusive DRM means that I won't be buying it. It's a sad result both for me and for Spore's development team.Just to be clear, I won't be pirating it either. If the game is ever released without DRM, you can count on my business. Until then, not so much."
1,Another voice in the anti-DRM choir,"I think I would have loved this game. My daughter loved the Creature Creator, and I was looking forward to buying her the full version. But I dont do DRM, ever. I wont even use iTunes; its all Amazon Music Store for me. Here's hoping EA gets the word and drops the DRM!"
1,Dee Are Em blows,I was so tempted to buy this until I learned of the DRM nightmare. I'll be holding off for a while in hopes that they fix it. EA is proficient at ruining a good thing. Blow.
1,Won't buy it because of the Securom DRM,I contacted EA 2 weeks ago to ask for details about Securom. The reply I got said the concerns about DRM were overblown and that a lot of the things that have been written are not true. He then directed me to the wikipedia page about Securom which verified that there are serious consumer issues. I will not buy this product until EA addresses this.
1,DRM ruined the game.,"This might have been a cool game but thanks to the DRM it won't play on my PC. Last game I'll ever buy from EA, I can't believe they ruined their products with DRM."
1,DRM? No thanks!,"Unfortunately I purchased 2 copies of this game here on Amazon, then I read about the draconian DRM included in Spore.EA is doing very bad things to its customers. I'll not install it on my system until EA removes the DRM.EA is cheating us, honest people who just want to play their games. On this way, I'll ban EA games from my purchases list. Next time I'll wait until the title comes out to read customer's comments before wasting my money.Convinced 6 friends to stay away from this game thanks to the DRM. Shame on you EA! Shame on you!"
2,"Good but not perfect, plus DRM","I just bought this game from the store and was playing it, so far the game seems rather creative, despite some people complaining about it's parts that are not true to real evolution. I would have no real qualms about this, but the DRM made it bad. This is probably the worst DRM I've seen in awhile. If it wasn't that I didn't know about the DRM till install, I would not have bought the game. I had enough trouble getting it to work I eventually searched the web for a patch to take out the DRM. The fact I did that should make you realize how bad the DRM is, that I had to find a patch. The game itself deserves some praise, though. I wish more games had this much thought put into them."
1,Terrible DRM = Don't Buy,"This game ships with DRM that punishes honest computer users, robs them of the resale value, and does nothing to curb piracy. Even with all of these restrictions, this game was already hacked on put on the torrents on Friday. Do not buy this game, it inevitably will stop working."
1,"Yes, another complaint about the DRM...","I wanted to voice my concern over the DRM. Electronic Arts, if you are reading this, take notes.No one wants DRM in their video games.I have long awaited the release of Spore; I was going to run out and purchase a ""copy"" until I heard about the 3 time install limit. This is worse then Microsoft Window's activation scheme. Until the DRM is removed, I will not purchase this game."
1,"Was going to buy it, until I saw the DRM","The game looks great and I was pretty excited about getting my hands on it for our PC and Mac; however, seeing as how it employs some pretty heavy-handed DRM on top of an expensive price for what's essentially a rental title (based on the limited installs they ""graciously"" give you), I'll wait for it to hit the bargain bin when it might be more palatable. I suffered through a DRM nightmare with some other titles and it's something I'm loathe to repeat. Someday the corporate bigwigs might realize DRM is a misguided proposition that only harms innocent customers...I'm sure the pirates are already enjoying the game regardless."
1,"Great game, DRM sucks!","This is a great game, it's just a shame that EA has decided to include SecuROM with it, and in doing so, treats its customers as criminals and limits their ability to play the game.I mean, if I decide to swap three hardware components in my computer, each on will count as a different computer and I will not be able to install Spore anymore.WTF?!?If I pay for the damn thing, I can install it as many times as I want!When will people understand that DRM is just a stupid idea, born from retarded brains that only see dollar signs and can't think two seconds ahead?Beisdes, it seems that the game was available for download on a lot of places a few days before it was officially launched, so what people should do was to download the game for free, send $50 to Will Wright and a letter to EA letting them know how stupid they are and how many potential clients they're losing because of it."
1,DRM? Fugget it!,"While I was anxiously awaiting this game to be release, I have since changed my mind. DRM, as currently implemented, is simply too restrictive, too invasive."
1,Spore,"SporeCame here to buy the game, read about the DRM hassle and decided not to buy. Pity for the designers, hope EA learns from the protests and missed sales."
1,You can't buy this game,"I'd love to buy this game. Unfortunately, that's not possible. You can only rent it and install it three times. When it installs, what is essentially a virus automatically installs. The only way to remove that is by completely reformatting my hard disk. This will use up one of my installs, but it will of course also use up any other installs for any other games I may have rented. If every game had crappy DRM like this one, the mess would be terrible.Pass on this one, unfortunately. A non-DRM-version? Sure, that would be worth five stars."
1,"Say ""NO!"" to SecuROM DRM","It's well within a publishers rights to attempt to protect their intellectual property from piracy, but you have to look at the method being used.SecuROM potentially opens a paying customers computer to being damaged. There is no reason for a game publisher to put their paying audience at risk simply because they want to protect their rights.There's an old saying - ""The right to swing your fist ends at the tip of my nose."" By engaging SecuROM EA is extending their right into space where they have no business being (i.e. telling me how many times I can install a game that I bought.)Tell EA and SecuROM that you aren't going to play their game and go buy something else. You might want to look at Galactic Civilizations II, a game with absolutely no DRM at all and yet it sells hundreds of thousands of copies."
1,DRM = A Lost Sale,"I've been looking forward to Spore for years, but due to the restrictive DRM I will not be purchasing the game."
1,SecuROM ? you have to be kidding.,I seriously had this game in my cart and was about to buy it when I found out that it comes with SecuROM. Oh well.
1,Thumbs down. DRM ruins it.,"I like how they treat the people that will actually pay for this like criminals. So if I wanted to pirate it I can get a version that I can install as many times as I want, does not put virus like software on my computer with out telling me AND a get it before release. Tell me why the people who steal this are getting a better game than me? And why am I not stealing it also....."
1,"SecuROM DRM, 'nuff said","It has DRM, no chance I will ever support it, so no chance I will ever buy this, too bad too, looked fun. Sadly I'd be willing to bet this actually INCREASES piracy of games, oh well, have fun promoting piracy, EA!"
1,Kudos to Amazon US for not deleting,I was actually looking forward to getting this game. These reviews have changed my mind. Kudos to Amazon US for not deleting all the one star reviews like Amazon UK. EA may have lost a customer but Amazon has not.
1,Waste of money.,This game is so short and and so shallow that it is directed for little kids. On top of that you truly don't even buy the game you get 3 activations then you have to go through EA to renew it. You do not want to go through EA customer service as they are known for having the worst possible customer service. All you'll get out of it is a big headache for an over hyped game. STAY AWAY FROM SPORE!
1,Turn off Virus protection to play the game? No thanks,"This game makes my virus protection software go crazy, it thinks the game is a security threat. There is no way I will turn off my computer's security to play a silly game. What were the developers of this game thinking? Amazon is getting a return on this one."
1,Draconian DRM destroys a delight,"Spore. This game has such promise. Such potential. And Electronic Arts blows it with ultra-restrictive DRM.You can only install the game three times. THREE. This is a game that has YEARS of replay value, and EA expects us to have only three installs before we go begging to them for just one more install. You better have a good reason too. How long before we start hearing about EA denying people licensing due to a bad string of hardware, natural disasters, and the like?Avoid this game like the plague. I wish I had. I'm planning to upgrade my PC in 3-6 months, heaven help me if my hard drive dies before then..."
1,Was going to buy until I heard about the DRM,"Wow... I was shopping around because I was stoked to buy this game. I like to upgrade my computer and hate to see I may be screwed by the DRM in the future.And turning off loyal customers for what EA? The game is already cracked, what good does this do but frustrate your paying customers?"
1,"DRM makes this a rented game, not a purchased one.","The DRM in this game is horrible, and in 5 years, you will likely not be able to install it again. This game is for RENT not for SALE."
1,"""Save game failed - spore will now exit""","bought it on sell on a whim biggest waste of money in my life. Can not believe this trash was ever released. I have played my share of games with bugs but this one i cant not just over look. A bug that basically got rid of all my progress and completely stop me from just saving a game after i was done is insane. ""F"" this game and the people who made is. save your money for a game that is worth it"
2,Spore PC,"Spore is a simple fun game that engages the creative side of the player. The humor is cute, game play is charming. The game is graphic intensive and don't expect much assistance from EA Tech Support who follow a flow chart but can't think outside the box. The game gets boring quickly and is limited."
1,Seemed Pretty Good At First,"This game, while not quite living up to the hype ( let's be honest, how could it?) can be rather fun, but 2 things have contributed to the fact that it is now collecting dust on my shelf. The first is the DRM....I don't really have anything to say about this that hasen't been said...suffice to say I beleive DRM has a decent shot at running PC gaming into the ground if this goes on. The other thing is, for whatever reason, this game just did not have the replay value i expected. I can't even quite put a finger on why, but i never play it anymore."
2,"Years of hype, just to be let down.","The Good: Beautiful colors and graphics. Unique game that is fun to play for a while.The Bad: EA put too much hype out there about it for way too long. They had everyone drooling over this games possibilities for YEARS. Talking like if gamers played this game every day, all day, it would take almost 80 years for them to explore all the games possible stars in the galaxy. And of course when the makers of Sims say something like that, it's very believable and appealing. But the game just didn't live up to the hype.The main goals in this game are eating, growing and evolving. There's not much more to do then that, except picking fights and making friends.Summary: It's a fun game, but I think they made it out to be more then it is."
1,18 months is not that old,Sigh. I was looking forward to playing this game. I like at least three of the four modes it plays it.But it won't run on *either* of my Macs. They're both to old. Unless I buy a copy of Windows (either Vista or XP) and install that on them. All because I bought them before Apple switched from the GMA 950 to the GMA 3100.So it makes at best a miserable frisbee for me.
1,Poorly executed,"With all the DRM incidents in the last couple of years, you'd think publishing companies would learn. Avoid this like the plague unless you want un-removable software on your PC and constant headaches."
1,Would never buy this game,"Came to Amazon to purchase it, but would NEVER buy it after reading the DRM reviews."
1,Spore review,In protest of unfair and draconian DRM scheme. EA should know consumers won't stand for this!
1,"Game ok, but DRM kills it","Having bought the game, it was a good amount of fun until I ran up against the DRM wall. Playing a game that is constantly assuming I'm a criminal until proven otherwise is just flat out demeaning to the customers and should be stamped out wherever it occurs.If I get much more annoyed with it, I'll be returning it."
1,DRM = No Sale,"I've been wanting Spore for a long time. But not so much that I'm willing to tolerate invasive malware ...errr... DRM. The worst thing that could have happened to this game, bar none.I refuse to rent my games, EA. Sorry, no sale."
1,DRM Protected,Spore looked like it could be one of the most exciting titles in years but comes with DRM disc protection so I will return it and never ever put it on my computer. Because this type of protection limits how often it can be installed it means you are basically paying full retail price to rent the game. EA should know better and they need to be boycotted til they stop these practices.
2,Way Overhyped,"I have been looking forward to this game forever. The game play is a bit oversimplified. Add in the free virus (DRM) that EA installs underhandly and it leaves me convinced to never buy or play another EA game on the PC.Had I not pre-ordered the game, I would never have bought it after reading about all the troubles people have had with the DRM virus."
2,"Fun, but not without its problems (SLI users beware!)","Why is it that every EA game is garbage out of the box. It takes them 3 patches before things are even feasible to play. SPORE is a very fun game...when it's working. First, the obvious. The DRM issues are ridiculous. I had to wait hours for the server to become available before I could activate. Second, graphical issues are rampant. I have two 8800 GT cards in an SLI configuration, and the game wouldn't even load because I was using an ""out-of'date"" video driver. Just happens that my ""out-of-date"" driver was the latest WHQL released nVidia driver. I had to install a beta driver just to run the game in SLI. Once I FINALLY got the game running I was plagued by random crashes, shader corruption, and numerous other graphical problems.Technical issues aside, this game is fun. The fun, however, wears thin as things become very repetitive. I guess all-in-all I would have to say this game really isn't worth $50, but then again, is any EA game?...ever?"
1,Waiting for EA to roll over - help us Amazon!,"Spore will remain on my Amazon ""wish list"" until I see that EA has fixed the DRM issue to the community's satisfaction. Maybe Amazon can apply some pressure, since they're losing so many potential sales of what could have been a blockbuster. Amazon also has a ""get-it"" factor - witness their recent move to DRM-free MP3 sales."
1,No way,"I was really looking forward to Spore, it would probably have been one of the best releases of the year. I'm a firm beliver that if a game is worth having, it's worth paying for. But there's no way I would pay for a game that can only be installed 3 times. After some of the other Securom fiascos, you'd think EA would learn something. No money for you."
1,"If you value freedom and decency, then do not buy this game, or any other game with this nasty DRM virus","Game looks incredibly fun. I was very excited to purchase it. Unfortunately, this is the latest in a series of games that EA is ruining with an insidious piece of DRM software that limits you to three installations and screws up your computer.Pirates will steal, EA. You cannot prevent it. What you can, prevent, however, is alienating potential customers by treating them like crooks and shackling your games with tyrannical programs. And I will not buy this game until this game is re-released without the DRM-lunacy."
1,Won't touch it,"Sorry but the install of invasive DRM and limit of three installs is not acceptable. Might be a good game, but I'll save my money for a different one without DRM. Have had too many hassles with DRM from legitimately purchased software."
1,DRM are you serious?,I was going to buy it this weekend but when I found that it was DRM'd I'm saying no. I don't buy DRM'd music why would I buy a DRM'd game.
1,DRM - no thanks,"Simply put, I wanted to buy it but then I heard about the DRM issues and now won't buy out of principles."
1,DRM Couldn't get any worse,"No, seriously, who was the one that decided limiting it 3 installs was a good idea? Punish the pirates, not the consumers."
1,Burn in the fiery pits of hell DRM,"The game is great, the DRM sucks. Fight back! Don't let them do this to games! This is not fair!"
1,"DRM, etc.","Everybody else has pretty much had the same complaint. The game's digital rights management system sucks. I saw EA, I knew better, I still fell into the trap. Never again.Put this game back into the development cycle for another ten years. Wash, rinse, repeat."
1,DRM kills this game for me,I really looked forward to this game only to find out about the 3 install limit. I upgrade and rebuild my computer at least once a year. I try to reinstall my OS at least as often to keep things running smoothly. I have little faith that their help line will always be available and most games I own I tend to go back and play years later just for kicks. This DRM will stop this game from ever being a classic.
1,Awful DRM policy,"I was very excited over this game and pre-ordered well before release. The DRM policy and limit of 3 activations kills it though. At this price I don't deserve to be treated like a software pirate. I understand EA wants to limit piracy, which can take away a major amount of their profit margin, but the DRM on this game is just ridiculous."
1,I will never buy this,How can EA legally get away with putting spyware on your computer.I will never buy another EA product for my PC. Be warned that this software can crash your system.
1,Tired of DRM and being treated like a criminal,"DRM is like gun control: if you outlaw guns, then only the outlaws will have the guns. DRM does nothing but make life difficult for honest customers and makes us feel like criminals, while the genuinely dishonest people will always find ways to circumvent the DRM and get a pirated copy of the game anyhow. I don't like any of it one bit."
1,DRM gets in the way of fun,I want to continue being a big fan of EA. But their DRM on this game causes it to go from an obvious purchase to an avoid-at-all-costs product. A pariah. Hopefully the massive turn out against this and other DRM policies will kill future efforts to add it onto games.
1,"Meh game, horrible DRM","Game definitely falls short of expectations, and DRM scheme is overly aggressive.I agree with others: DRM only hurts the legitimate user. It does not hinder piracy at all."
1,OK- haven't even tried it yet but...,"I was looking forward to this game for a year, but based on all the negative DRM reviews I'm going to have to pass after all. DRM is a deal breaker. I'm not giving any vendor a license to charge me over and over again for the same product. That's ludicrous. What ever happened to paying a fair price for a fair service?"
1,"Was expecting good things, was let down.","Ok, I know this game had over a year of hype behind it, and as such needed to take my experience with some disinterest.But even so, the game play has been too dumbed down. 90% of the creature/machine editing is for cosmetic purposes only, and the gameplay itself is much too simple.I purchased this from Best-Buy before I heard about the Draconian DRM issues, and that annoys me even more.2 stars for game play, reduced to 1 star for DRM."
1,Boring. Instant Shelfware.,"The possibilities offered by the advertising was not borne out by the product. After playing this game for less than 10 hours, I removed it from my computer and put it on the shelf, never to be touched again. I WISH I could have returned it and gotten my money back."
1,EA hates paying customers,"Simple. EA hates its paying customers. They are nothing but criminals. In turn, we hate EA. Passionately.*insert DRM comment here*"
1,Like so many others have said... the DRM is a show stopper,"Unfortunately, the decision to include a DRM method that has been proven to be flawed and cumbersome destroys what might otherwise be a spectacular game. Save your money, and save the frustration."
1,3 Installs is an insult!,Not interested in buying this game now that I've heard about the install limits and forced internet registration.Go sit on a stick EA!
1,To much DRM for me,"Put this game on Steam and I will purchase it, until then EA you can keep your DRM and I will keep my cash."
1,DRM ruins the experience,"Game is ok, but the DRM just makes it to much hazzle. Ive spent three hours trying to get support from EA when the game wouldnt install after I spent almost a week from I purchased the game online untill I could install it.Pity to ruin a game this way."
1,Want to buy,"I badly want to buy this product but am holding out.EA remove SecureROM and let me create a account for each person who uses the computer this is installed in, and I will buy it.Shockingly, my daughter would love to be able to create her own creatures share share them in her own gallery, but no she would be stuck having to use my account. Or what if I don't want her to use my account and potentially mess up my saved games and creatures? Too bad, I'd have to buy a copy per family member, even having just one computer in the house."
1,I have been deceived!!!!,"I have a dedicated PC for games: no internet, no connection at all, so that my kid can play safely, no predators, no virus...Now I offered him this crap for Xmas, and he cannot play because internet is mandatory. what should I do: abandon the dedicated PC? Then why did I purchase it? Or put the game on my professional PC, which is connected ot internet? Ridiculous! I am really furious, and I whish Electronic Arts company a bankrupcy for 2010, and all managers there to get H1N1, 2, 3, 4 and 5!!!I can tell you that seing the disappointment on the face of my kid for XMas is something I *cannot* forgive."
1,DRM'ed,"I have been excited about this game since I first heard about it a few years ago. This is exactly that type game that needs to be made. Unfortunately, after I purchased the game at Wal-Mart I saw that it had DRM installed on it. I ended up returning the game unopened. I have had too many titles with DRM not run on my computer I am not going to take that chance again. Hopefully game manufactures will eventually figure out a way to make money on the game without having to have access to my computer."
1,Potential fun negated by DRM,"Until these forms of DRM that treat legitimate, paying customers as criminals are removed there's no chance of getting a positive experience out of games like Spore. There is a lot to like here, but the experience is more shallow and broad than deep. It is worth playing when the DRM is removed."
1,Bad decision EA,"The game is fun, for what it is. The actual gameplay is somewhat limited, but the creator engines are very fun if you're into that. I've been having a blast making different creatures. I know that my mom and others in my family would probably love this game.Unfortunately, I would not recommend this game to any friend or family. The game is limited to just 3 lifetime activations, and uses a draconian DRM policy to enforce EA's ""rights"". I probably would have bought several copies as christmas presents, but not with the current price/policy. Eventually the price will come down- and maybe $10 for 3 activations is worth it. However, unless EA changes their policy or the price, I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,When you bite the hand that feeds...,"When are companies such as EA going to get a clue??? Don't they realize that all DRM (especially totalitarian DRM such as SecuROM *should be SecuR4PE*) does is punish the people who actually paid for the game... Jeez, I could just get on ***Torrent and download a copy that I wouldn't ever have to activate, and I wouldn't have to pay for it! Maybe we should all just do that... Then maybe someone sitting in a comfy leather chair in front of a luxurious mahogany desk will get a clue... *end rant*"
1,Amazing Game,"I already beat The last stage on one of the planets, and this game is amazing, except, some parts in the creature stage are repetitious, In all The game gets 4 stars and im going to have to refer to the flash mob here,and say DRM is the reason for 1 star."
2,Meh,"The first part of the game was a blast: Swimming around in the ocean, eating other little bugs, then moving on land. But the tribal and later phases were just... stupid. The interface is impossible, the story arc is non-existent."
2,Fun...If there was not DRM,"As soon as it starts to install, you are attacked by DRM. Ruins the game. Sure you can refuse to create an account with EA, so not 100% terrible, and the game is pretty fun, but DRM makes any game worse than it is."
1,Misconceptions and truth,"The DRM in Spore lets you install the game AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT on the same system, up to a MAX OF 3 SYSTEMS. The DRM is still buckwaas (look it up, its Punjabi) because it's yet another legal virus that run in the background without ever asking for your approval. On a closing note, let your lil bro/sis work through the first 3 worlds. Then in space age, conquer other cities by depriving hem of economic resources, only to throw religious propaganda (not propa-ganja) at a later time. Does it sound familiar to anyone out there in the middle east?"
1,Defective By Design,"Man I bought this game and was so ready to go to town and take off of work. Only to find out it is ruined by DRM. Well EA, now i am selling this on craig's list and looking to get a nice clean pirated broken copy. You guys make me sick. Cutting edge turns corporate. You think you're Sony or something."
1,defectivebydesign and drm infected,"New video game restrictions on install limit.Often I upgrade my computer and every year or so I like to either reformat or get a new hard drive. Does this mean that if events go bad and I have to reformat or upgrade more often than usual (which happens, freak viruses bugs ect) I'll have to rebuy the game? ... why? I payed for it I should be able to play it whenever I want for the rest of my life.Not only that I've seen on the newer videocards Spore crashes about every 30 minutes(in space age) with no auto save or quick save options. DRM has ruined the potential reuse lifetime of my electronic products."
1,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,"Many people here posted 1-star reviews due to the DRM in Spore. Now, many people are posting positive reviews because they seem to enjoy the game. Guess what? The positive review people DO NOT UNDERSTAND what they're saying. People are posting positive reviews because they do not understand the nature of DRM. They don't notice the problems now, but they will - because DRM can shut down your ability to play the game you bought. Anyone who gives Spore a positive review simply doesn't understand the horrible problems that come with any game which contains DRM.The 5-star reviews are all written by people who do not understand how computers work, or what DRM does deep-down within your computer. In short, these people are ignorant. Don't be ignorant. Don't buy this game. You WILL regret buying Spore."
4,My kids love it,"I was worried when I read the reviews here that Spore would be dull. My son was very excited about it, though, so I bought it for him for Xmas. He and his sister (11 and 9), and some neighbors still play with it. I am not sure it will last a whole lot longer, but I think 3 months of pretty consistent interest is something!The thing is, there are several different parts, and many different things to focus on. My son has been really enjoying designing vehicles, lately. My daughter is trying to win while being completely peaceful. (They are not *always* stereotypes!) The gameplay doesn't seem to be as intricate as, say, Civilization or Sim City, but is more suited to a shorter attention span (and it is easier to get them away from it for dinner). They like the unpredictability of the opponents and how easy it is to make their own creatures, and the wide variety of creatures they can make. The DRM hasn't bothered us."
4,Addicting Game,"First, a lot of people seem to have downrated the product due to the DRM, which says little on the playability.I've only played the game a few days, but it has been quite enjoyable.You start out as a cell, on your first time through, and you help your creature evolve through several stages, eventually getting into space. Once there, you can explore around and find other galactic species. Some are friendly, others are extremely hostile. You'll end up setting up trade routes, creating a fleet of ships, and conquering your neighbors in a large scale. There are a LOT of stars, and planets, that you can visit to setup your colonies.For the moment, this game has been more interesting than World of Warcraft."
1,Can't Install,"This game can't be installed unless you let it install a rootkit which phones home to EA periodically. This information probably includes private data from your harddrive.Once you buy the game, no stores will take it back either. Even though you can't install it."
1,DRM is a failure,"I wanted to play catch.This wasn't just going to be a normal game of catch.This was going to be an incredibly innovative game of catch, where I crafted the ball myself, and when I finally was able to throw the ball, it would changed based on how I crafted it. Then, catch would adapt to how I threw the ball in the first place. Then it would share my ball with everyone else who was playing their own version of catch.Then I found out that I could only play catch in my back yard, and if I wanted to play with anyone else, they would have to sit on my shoulders.DRM doesn't work. DRM promotes piracy."
1,I want it!,"EA! I want to buy this game, i've played it and it looks cool, but I can't buy it with the DRM, sorry."
1,Don't buy this game,"I was interested in this game but since it has DRM I will not buy this game ever, and I recommend others not do buy it."
1,YIKES!,"When I preordered this game months ago, I was aware that game publishers used really annoying DRM schemes, but upon receiving the game, I was shocked at the effort EA made to render Spore unplayable. Had I known, I wouldn't have bought it to begin with. I'll chalk this one up to a hard lesson learned. What happened to Maxis? Remember the good old days when they just made fun toys with great extras? A Maxis game was worth buying just for the user manual and the box."
1,DRM order cancellation,"Unfortunately, Amazon will not allow me to cancel this order so it will need to be a return later. Aggressive DRM should not be tolerated and the best way to make an active stance is to cancel existing orders and let the community know why."
1,Call EA to complain about DRM,"I came to Amazon today to buy this game, but after reading about the DRM issues I've decided not to give EA any money. I do not support companies with such anti-consumer policies (e.g. Sony), and I boycott them.Warning other people [here] about EA's DRM is good, but complaining directly to EA's management is better. I called them and said, ""I was going to buy Spore today, but instead I've decided to boycott your company's products for the foreseeable future because of your aggressive DRM practices"".I recommend that you do the same. To find their phone number: Go to EA's website and click ""corporate info"" at the bottom of the page. In the new window, click ""investor relations"", then ""more information"", and ""contact information"". This will display the main phone number for the headquarters in Redwood City, CA.Good luck."
1,BioShock all over again...,"A short while ago I purchased BioShock, a program that uses the same DRM software as this product. When I first got BioShock I was super excited because it was the first PC game I could afford in quite a while. I installed the game and quickly found out that my graphics card was not up to par. SO, being the guy I am, I went out and got a new graphics card. Not much, I think it was on sale for $50.Well, I got the new graphics card installed and updated all my drivers just so I could be sure the game would be good to go. When I launched the game for a second time BioShock decided that I needed to reactivate the game. So, in just getting the game installed and running for the first time I used 2 of the 3 activations.I was so paranoid that my computer would crash or that the game would be reactivated I didn't turn my computer off or restart for a week. The game sounds great but sadly I will just have to wait until this game goes to the discount rack."
