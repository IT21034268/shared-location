4,You'll Never Step On An Ant Again...,"This French novel is borderline science-fiction marketed as straight fiction. It's a very captivating story as the narrative alternates between a family who, one-by-one, mysteriously vanish into the basement of home they've just inherited, and the struggle of a few ants to discover what lies behind some mysterious forces threatening their city. Of course the two are related, but its not clear how until the end. The genius of the book is its incredibly evocative portrait of ant life, including the politics of a federation of ant cities, the threats of other species, and just their whole life cycle. It's a quite remarkable achievement to be able to make this stuff so fascinating. You will never think about ants the same way, and of course, this is meant to make us think about ourselves as well."
3,"Great Ants, Cardboard People","Ants were developed quite well. I actually enjoyed their story. The people on the other hand, were boring and quite predictable."
2,"Mildly diverting, but disappointing overall.","Perhaps it was the big build up, or the comparisons to ""Watership Down"" that set up impossible expectations for me, but this book was a let-down. I found the translation (from the French) to be rigid, and I found the ants, and perhaps I am missing the big point here, to be largely unsympathetic characters."
3,"Decent, light reading, but nothing to go crazy over.","EMPIRE is a fine tale from the ant's perspective. That is what makes the story fun and engaging. I enjoyed this part very much. However, the human characters and plot are not believable at all. The human plot makes little if any sense as no human would react this way. A few might but not very many. The ending was disappointing and weak. The book's strength is in the description of the ant society. That is very well done."
2,"Interesting concept and story, poor English reading","This book has a very interesting concept that will appeal to those who like thinking of nature as a singular whole. Moreover, it is an interesting quasi-scientific introduction to one of entomology's most interesting members. However as other reviewers have mentioned, this English translation is lacking.I rented a copy from my local library and could not finish it, unable to get beyond the stilted translation of what could have possibly been a more elegant French text. If you are prepared to navigate a bungled use of English idioms, unbelievable character dialogue, and completely earnest sentences like: ""[the ants] fired, propelling jets of hyper-concentrated formic acid with all the might of their sphincters"" then you might enjoy this fanciful book. Otherwise, I would encourage you to spend your time with other literature."
2,Maybe a decent early teen book,"If one had no knowledge of ants, this book might be interesting. I did not find it in anyway comparable to ""Watership Down"". Even ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH"" was far superior. The lack of character development and the methodical way that the Facts About Ants! was presented caused me to give this one to the used book store when I'd made it 4/5 through...sorry, couldn't finish it."
1,This book hurt me.,"This is quite possible one of the 5 worst books I've ever read. If the autor new anything about ants he apparently wanted to hide this fact by not useing any correct iformation. The best thing I can say about the ant's in the book is they had the right number of legs. As for the people in the book...i can't even tell you how badly portrayed they are. The only bright side to the book is that he inserts little ""clips"" from a fictional book called The Encylopida of Relivite and Absolute Knowladge. The good thing about these exerpts are they make you glad you don't have to read that book as well. In my opinon don't buy this book, don't even look at the cover."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book mainly because of the great reviews that I read on the amazon.com page. After reading it, I must say I was disappointed. While the premise is intriguing, the author fails to engage the reader in that great thrall of adventure where one roots for characters one has grown to admire. Instead I found myself wishing that I were nearing the last page simply to get the read over with. As for comparing the book to Watership Down, I don't see the comparison, unless this book has lost something in the translation."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND USE THE LIBRARY!!!,"I feel that the reviews are correct about the ants and people.The book was good and interesting,but I really hated the abrupt death of one of the ant charaters and the rushed ending to the book was a BIG turn off.I hope that the other books are better written."
1,This book stinks!,"I bought this book on the recommendation of the myrmecology (study of ants) mailing list. They loved it, I hate it. The ants are not at all believable. I really wanted to see what a hive mind might be like, but that's not here. The only thing that makes the ants look good is how poorly he portrays the people! And the surprise ending is the stupidest thing I have read in a long, long time."
4,Werber's Ants trilogy,"The Empire of the Ants is really a translation of the French book ""Les Fourmis"", which is the first part of what I would call the Ants trilogy. The two other books are titled ""Le Jour des fourmis"" (""The Day of the Ants""), and ""La RÃ©volution des fourmis"" (The Revolution of the Ants""). It is still unknown to me if these books have ever been translated to English."
2,great but enragingly disappointing ending,"Empire of the Ants is quite captivating and well written - and seems to be leading up to a mind-blowing final act. I found myself completely caught up in the story - the intrigue appearing to point toward some sort of a revelation that ants and humans are the same - not metaphorically, but metaphysically. I believe that the ideas I had for where I thought the story was going to lead me were immensely more interesting than the way the book ultimately finished. That is certainly not to say I am a storytelling genius - it is to say that the ending of this book really, really sucks. I mean, I was so let down I wanted to throw this book into a magma pool. However, there are no magma pools around here so I sold it to Half Price Books instead."
2,Overrated and Unsatisfying,"I was completely disapointed with this highly praised (and marketed) book. Although the insight into the world of Ants was interesting, the human tie-in was boring and incredibly unrealistic to the point of being just stupid. (Like the police giving up their search because some of their men disappeared...ya, that happens). If you liked Watership Down, which this book is constantly being compared to, don't bother, because you will be hugely disappointed."
4,Defending Westerns!,"Just finished Law For Hire: Defending Masterson and liked in on a few levels; literary and as entertainment . First of all, Brooks is very good writer, the prose flows as does the storyline. The skill that goes into producing a good book shines through. In short, he knows his craft, knows his subject matter and can convey it with talent.Second; it's an entertaining story with Pinkerton agent Teddy Blue back protecting another historical western figure or figures actually, since this time around it's Bat Masterson and his two brothers. This is really a western thriller, an action book where you, the reader has to try to figure out who wants Masterson dead and why.Next, there are enough interesting characters and twists to keep the storyline from dragging and as I said, the story flows making the train or bus commute, at least for me, a better small journey.Finally, there's this. I just ordered another in the series so I'm putting my money where my mouth is."
3,Back Cover Description,"His Holiness Pope John XXIII has graciously imparted to the authors and publishers of Vision Books His Apostolic Blessing. ""In view of his ardent zeal for the spiritual welfare of all His children, the Sovreign Pontiff... cherishes the prayerful hope that these volumes may stimulate their readers to a greater desire for virtue and for that exemplary holiness of life which should characterize Catholic youth."" Domenico Cardinal Tardini, Secretary of State to His Holiness, July 4, 1959"
1,Item never recieved,if i could give this item 0 stars i would because i never got it. I tried contacting the seller and they just sent me back an email that didn't answer any of my questions.
3,Terrific episode... BUT,"I love this series with all my heart. I mean every Tuesday night at 10 PM I am right there in front of the TV waiting for the show to come on. And I've seen this episode many, many times. The acting is amazing, and the writing in this episode is superb. But, come on y'all. Why buy just one episode when you can get the entire first season, filled with a lot more classic 1st season episodes such as ""Stalked"", ""Closure"", ""Bad Blood"", and so many other wonderful episodes that started this fantastic show. So while I'm not telling anyone to not buy this product, I am saying however, wouldn't it be a smarter idea to save up a few more bucks to buy the entire season?"
1,Not Worth Getting,"Don't get me wrong. This episode was great but not worth getting all by itself. If you pay twice as much, you get 22 episodes instead of just the one. This episode is included in the set. I just wish there was an episode introducing all the characters to each other instead of introducing the audience to the characters all at once. I was disappointed that there wasn't a 2-hour beginning like most series. Oh well. Don't bother with this dvd. GET THE SET!!!!!!"
2,Real fans should boycott these piecemeal relaease,"Another bad DVD release. It looks like a crude attempt to extract as much revenue as possible from large base of loyal fans. Some reviewers who wax lyrical over the 'special' interview features and ""insight into the show"" in this single episode DVD either work for the publisher or miss the point that any of these items could have been included in a 'full season' release. This piecemeal approach is frustrating for real fans of the series who, to date, have seen only one complete season released. I for one will protest with my wallet. It stays shut until the complete seasons are released."
1,Why buy one episode?,"Law and Order is on television most nights of the week. Why buy one episode on DVD. I did not buy this one, and would like to add to the previous comments stating a season box set release is necessary and in demand! Come on executives of Universal, we're waiting!"
2,Wake up Universal,"Having watched a friend's copy, I'm relieved that I followed my instincts and did not buy it. It's ok but I'll wait for the box set. Series one was excellent and I'm sure that are many fans of this excellent programme waiting , as I am, to order the complete set. Wake up Universal."
4,Warm and moving characters. Well written.,"I loved this book. The characters were warm,sensuous and completely engulfing."
2,Reads like a TV movie.,"There's not much to this book; unrealistic, the plot wanders and goes in circles, ultimately boring. The vampire series was much better."
3,Disappointing,"I did actually enjoy reading this book for the most part. I found the characters likable and entertaining, but was waiting for some sort of revelation at the end of this book. Nothing. I found the character of Old Woman the most interesting, and she had a pretty important roll in the story.....then her whole character was just sort of abandoned. We never found out her magical name, and it didn't really seem necessary for Phoebe to use it to return to Duncan's time. Afterall, he got there without it. I also thought the character of Alex played too important of a part in the book to have his story wrapped up as an afterthought. Also, *who* was this woman who bought the book about Duncan in the Epilogue?! She should have had some sort of connection rather than just being a stranger. I guess I'm tired of the idea of time travel being used only to get a modern day person into a unique setting. The stories could be so much more interesting and memorable."
3,Why is this author so popular?,"This is the second book I have read by her and I just don't understand the fuss. I love historical, timetravel, sci-fi and otherwise offbeat romances and have read many of them. This book is so-so. Her characters are well defined and likeable and the dialogue is entertaining. But the romance has no development - they go from first meeting - to bed - to in love forever in the space of a few brief scenes and there is not much of a plot. Her main character is a ""History buff"" who worked for several years as a research assistant to an American History professor yet her level of knowledge about the period she is thrown into is right at about the level of your average 4th grader. Better that she had been a Psych. major since she given to offering advice that could have come-out of any pop-self-help book.The author doesn't know much more about the period then the heroine and none of it rang true. All in all it is readable if you don't expect much from it or the author."
5,Wonderful time-travel adventure,"If you like time-travel, romance, adventure and history then this is the book for you. The heroine is sent back in time to the home of the pirate Duncan and there the adventure begins. I loved this book so much that I've just ordered her other two time travels - Knights and Outlaw - from Amazon off course. Libby Withnall"
2,star trek log sigh,"First. I haven't seen any episodes of the animated series, so I treated this book as a short-story collection. The stories were predictable and weren't that intelligent either. Might have worked better as a cartoon."
2,Star Trekkin',"Another set of three adventures from the animated series. As in Star Trek: Log One, the episodes are of pretty poor quality, but the author makes the best of the material (this time without the many typographical errors that plagued the first installment). Still manages to be somewhat enjoyable and if you're a fan of the original series and haven't seen the cartoon.The episodes included herein are:""The Survivor""""The Lorelei Signal""""The Infinite Vulcan"""
4,Pretty good for the money...,"First of all, there are two seat covers and two head rest covers in one box. That's awesome but it says that there is only one of each on the product description so I'm sure lots of people will end up buying a total of 4 on accident. These seat covers are pretty easy to put on and I haven't had an issue with them slipping. I have a 2009 Nissan Xterra and they look really nice. I would definitely recommend them."
2,VERY CHEAP!!!!!!!,"I bought these for a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3. They fit decently enough. My main complaint about these is that the straps used to tie the headrest cover and the tops of the seat covers to the seat snapped off immediately. The ties pulled off like they were held on by one single tiny thread. I assure people i did not use extreme force but merely tried tying it as if tying ones shoe. I thought it was a fluke when the first one pulled off so quickly, but the rest followed. Its not even worth my time to send them back. Other than the straps, the seat covers seem nice enough, though i haven't really put them through any serious wear yet."
4,seat cover,"we just bought a new Subaru Forester which is wonderful!!. The only problem with it is that the standard upholstery ( and we couldn't upgrade) is very light gray. We bought these seat covers for the front seat and they're wonderful. I was sure they would twist and move, but they don't they stay in place and seem to be doing a great job. And the price was very reasonable."
3,O.K. for the price,"I'm using these on a 2005 MINI. I was looking for inexpensive covers and they fit the bill. However, if you have side bolsters on your seats the covers do not fit the seats snugly. Also,the covers will cover any pockets you have on the back of your seats and any back rake adjustment levers and quick release levers that slide the seat forward.The covers have a thin foam lining so I doubt that they will stand up to a washing once they have gotten dirty.One more thing, the illustration makes the covers look like they are a solid grey, they are not. The panels on the sides of the front of the seat are solid grey, the center panel is a multi-hued grey lozenge pattern. (The back and sides are a grey stretch material.)"
2,not what was expected,Ok product but the desription makes it sound like it is more. Price is better at Kmart for the same thing too.
2,Shiny,"These seat covers fit in my Ford Focus quite perfectly, however the material is very shiny and slick. Not really what I wanted. The grey color appears silver in real life and has a wet look it is so shiny."
1,The item in the picture is not what I received!,The product that arrived is NOT what is in this picture! What a pain! What a waste of time and energy having to return something.
4,fairfield seat covers,Seat covers are easy to install and are good looking. you can tell they are 1 size fits all because the fit is loose but considering the price and ease of installation I guess you can't complain.
4,Changing,"With this album you see that Vai is ""growing"" up. His music is not anymore just speed and howling guitars, which you can hear on, for example, sex and religion and passion and warfare, becomes more sophisticated. I can't say it's only an improvement, this music is different, but still great. He shows ha can create more than only metal. Great album!"
4,Bad first review,"Mk, my first review was stupid.The Ultra Zone is not my favorite Vai album, but then again, I don't have many Vai albums... yet. Someone said that the pleasure comes from the individual listener, and I agree. That's all it really comes down to. This album is less... predictable (?) than, say, Passion and Warfare, even though that CD is hardly predictable. Steve Vai can't make bad music (at least, I haven't heard any), so this CD is definitely recommended."
4,mixed feeling tending towards positive,"The first time that listened to this cd my first thought was to exchange it for another cd.With repeated listens I have grown more accustomed to it.The album has elements of steve previous albums.You certainly cannot discount his compositional and orchestrational skills that are present here.There are a few less memorable songs here but it is the fore mentioned skills that saves them somewhat.My favourite tracks on the album would be The Blood and Tears, OOOO, and Windows to the Soul.I think that Fire garden was a better overall album than this but his vocals have definaetly improved.I think that you need to be in a certain mood to be able to listen to this all the way through.Overall I would give this album 3.5 - 4.I must admit that you will take notice when steve solos.Can't wait for the day when he does a real kick ass rock album......."
5,In an evil world.. ..Heavenly genius,"Repetitive DJ loop brain rot 'dance' 'music' is dead. Long live Steve Vai. Everybody thinks they know what they like and what they don't like when it comes to music. Vai forces you think different, he allows you to re-invent your ear and tastes by making the sounds of your own heart into accessable melody for all to hear, not just the few who are ""journo. insider"" enough to understand 'the scene'. No pill can give a high that replaces real emotion; Just as no DJ spinning loops can evoke genuine earth grooves quite like the track 'Ooo' for example. Look what music has become to those who exploit it - nothing, an empty experience there lost souls burn in agony. If you buy this record your life WILL be better.Don't just buy it - BE IT! Music is the best - I love ya Steve."
3,A shred above,"3 1/2Although this still falls into the plastically-produced, chauvinistic sonics which dominated metal and rock guitar virtuosos throughout the decades, Vai is better at tweaking the formula into something a little more special then fanatical runs on top of musty riffs (and better at recording it as well). Granted, this particular brand of experimentation can yield almost as much corniness as it can joy, but at least you stay somewhat engaged with anticipation."
2,Heard It before !,"Steve's new effort has no emotion. His tribute to Frank Zappa is favorable, yet his now infamous #7 track (You know, the one that is supposed to be his most passionate and beautifully played?) reflected a talented man going through the motions. Sorry Steve, this album is full of licks I've heard from you many times before. Oh, by the way, you need to ditch the vocals. Jeff Beck can't sing either, but at least he was smart enough to ""shut up and play his guitar"". You have the talent to become the greatest guitarist ever, now get to work and take your music forward. If someone wants to hear quality Steve Vai, they should try Passion and Warfare, the first half and last song on the second half of Fire Garden, and Alien Love Secrets."
2,Baffling...with few gems.,"First, I'm a big fan of Steve's music. But this recording makes very little sense. The first five songs range from good to great. Then the last eight songs range from bad to confusing to dreadful. I can't understand how such a fantastic musician, with such great feeling, and depth of emotion can create such a mess. He has the skills!! I have most of Steve's recordings, and this stands out as a near disaster. Mostly disapointing."
2,Not the Vai I remember - more electronic beeps than electric guitar,"I loved Vai's work twenty years ago, so I decided to pick up a newer album of his to see how it was. Vai had a way of making a guitar really sing in some melody but he could also rip out the metal type jams when he had to. This album seems not like any guitar album I have heard. It is a strange, ambient and oriental type of sound that again, does not sound like a guitar, or Vai himself was even around. Maybe it is just an experimental kind of album, but goodness what happened to some structure? This is not even noodling, some of this is like someone left the answering machine on and then let their five-year-old pound on multiple levels of xylophones with sticks. Some may think this is a masterpiece but my opinion is that it is an experimental album that tries to hard to come up with innovative sounds. In the meantime, where is the guitar?"
2,Steve can play but not the blues,Steve plays great but the tribute to Stevie Ray is awful. There is a mentality among shredders that blues is just a I-IV-V progression. It is way beyond that. I love Vai but the one type of music he cannot play well at all is the blues. Just buy Passion and Warefare
2,NOT SO GOOD,"He needs to come up with music that is able to communicate different fans age. Since I strated listening to him after he broke up with white snake, I realized that his music is devoted to very narrow range of listenrs (mostly very young people). Whenevr he tries to come up with new idea for his music, it turns out to be immature. Yes, there are some very beautiful piesces of art in each album but not before you have to listen to some junk.I think I need to stop listening to his music for some years."
4,Completely Vai-esque. A new Kaleydoscope of guitar sounds!,"Well, one would usually think that a former spandex-rockstar-guitarrist turned soloist in his late thirties would stick to the mainstream... Yes and no. Yes, you can find Vai's inspiration Zappa on some of the tunes (his voice even sounds similar). Yes, you can find the typical Vai ""let play ALL notes at the same time on a guitar. So what's new? Welcome, Steve, on the World music wagon! But instead of straying to far away of his terrain he actually enhances the typical rock song with slight touches of percussion and, obviously on the first track, indian chant. He got lucky this time, because trying to please all fans hanging to just one of his former CDs should find enough good material here to make it worth the buy."
4,Don't pass this one by!!!,"Many people compare Vai & Satriani. While they're both amazing in their own right, Vai has long been off in a completely different direction than Satch. While Satch is the king of the straight-ahead guitar jam, and writes beautiful ballads, Vai has turned into this heavy-duty, mad, multi-instrumental genius. There are 13 tunes, 5 with vocals, on ""Ultra Zone."" The best part is that Vai now does his own singing. Technically-speaking, his voice isn't as good as the guy he had singing on the last two discs, but listening to Steve sing makes you cringe a lot less. In fact, on the disc's best track ""Voodoo Acid,"" the vocals are really great. Sort of whacked-out, goofy Zappa'ish delivery. Voodoo Acid may very well be the most inventive and original rock/fusion composition I've heard in 10 years. You should seriously consider checking this out."
5,Steve Vai The Ultra Zone,"Steve Vai did a excellent job with this album. Most instrumental albums are just showcases for the musician to show his chops, but in this case Vai wrote the music wonderfully. This is an enjoyable album for non-guitar fans too. All the notes are played with feeling and emotion. There is also a two great tribute songs, FRANK which is a tribute to the late Frank Zappa is a beutiful ballad. Then JIBBOOM which is a song inspire from SCUTTLE BUTTIN by STEVIE RAY VAUGHN. Windows to the soul is a masterpiece which I thought was the best song of 1999. Steve Vai is a combination of technique, emotion, and creativity."
4,Steve Vai Ultra Zone,"I liked this album a lot. I am a Big Vai fan. I think he is one of the best guitar players to tread this earth! And in my mind he again deserves that spot by this album. It is very uniqe from his other albums, but it is definitly worth listening to. The musicals are great! Im not crazy about the vocals, but im a guitar fan at heart!I think you will like it!!!Give it a try!!!"
4,"Easy does it, now...","I know what you're gonna say: some tracks sound like Satriani, some tracks sound like Queen, and the English lyrics are like outtakes from a high-school production of ""Hair."" BUT: at least it sounds like Satriani, Queen, and high-school ""Hair"" FROM OUTER SPACE. Simply put: if you can get through that dirty little ditty (you know the one) without smiling, you've never been to the Ultra Zone. Can you blame a guy for downplaying the pyrotechnics in favor of a stronger groove, and a more personal presence? I can't. Four picks up for using the word ""scum"" in a great song. So says Sphex."
4,"Intense, emotionally gripping and above all, honest.","Once again the frequently labeled ""zen master"" of guitar has produced something that overwhelms me beyond words. The production is absolutely amazing. His use of sequenced percussion and such is truly unique. The compositions are brilliant. It is an absolute gem in every respect."
2,Not Vai's best by far,"I've liked Steve Vai, since he became a part of David Lee Roth's band, back in the mid-80's (Eat 'Em And Smile is such a good album, minus That's Life). Loved Passion And Warfare and really liked Fire Garden, but this one is not in the same league. I listened to it last week, after having not listened to it for many moons, and I found myself skipping to the next track, over and over. It dawned on me that I didn't find it very interesting at all. Vai is an incredible guitarist, but can be out in left field. That's part of what makes him interesting to listen to. In the case of Ultra Zone, not so much. The album cover is the best part of the package, IMO. Another great guitarist to check out, if you haven't already, is Paul Gilbert."
2,What a disappointment :(,"I'll start by saying I'm a Steve Vai fan and have been that since Sex & Religion and especially since Fire Garden. After the excellent FG I really expected a lot from this album, but I was more or less disappointed. I must question the same thing that was already brought up in an earlier review: Has Steve ran out of ideas? In my opinion The Ultra Zone is mostly a bland and a dull album. Most of the songs on Fire Garden (as well as on Sex & Religion) were strong, emotional and beautiful. I really can't say the same about this one even though I'd really love to. I really hope Steve does better with his next attempt."
4,Back from the wilderness,"Vai spent a few years finding his muse again after the complete success of Passion and Warfare. It's not as if the subsequent albums were bad, but there was a lot of experimentation and not all of it successful. P&W was a such an complete picture of his early playing that perhaps there was nowhere else to go within that style. In any event, by the time Ultra Zone was released, Vai had found his footing as a live solo act courtesy of the G3 tours, and that confidence is clearly heard in the music. This album has a return to some of the idiosyncracies of is early, Flex-Able material but also shows a more mature edge with greatly improved singing and songwriting on the vocal tunes. Steve is one of the only survivors of the ""athletic 80's"" school of guitar playing, and he's one of the few who does it well enough to hold up musically in and of itself."
2,Not so good,"This album was a big disappointment for me. Vai is at his best in the instrumental mode. There is something wrong with any song he write containing lyrics. He can't sing (although he's a better singer than Satch), and he can't write lyrics (they come out silly, sappy, and sounding like a teenager wrote them). This all leads me to wonder where he gets the encouragement to keep singing, or worse, have someone else sing his stupid songs. The opening track of this album almost made not listen to the rest of the album. It's terrible, and there are a few others later on that just plain stink. Now, I love Vai's instrumental songs. They're beautiful. I will definitely make sure to hear each new album before I buy it. I wish I hadn't bought this one. If you want a Vai album, get Passion and Warfare, or maybe Fire Garden (though he sings a few tracks on this one too)."
3,little bits of ultra on this album,"Ok, he is a technical player, he is fast, he is funny and he is original. I've always liked Vais soft tapping techniques. I think he is the greatest guitarist when it comes to tapping. But there should be something more than technical abitilies when a guitarplayer puts an album out. Vais playing still has too little heart in it. He has developed ""from the dark ages"" (Roth band) but still he sounds too mechanical. Some of the songs are too long and his guitar sound doesn't fit into every song. Still one of thebetter guitar albums out there"
2,Plug it in steve!,"Why does ""the Vaister"" use smurffs as backing vocals on ""lucky charms"", i think it shows that Vai wants to be ever so creative - and he is, but on a guitar. So Steve ""shut up and play your guitar"" coz' Passion and Warfare has to be your greatest album."
3,Wow! Is this thing expensive!!,"Boy, is this thing expensive! A friend gave me his after he completed his remodeling project and I find that it is a nice jig. It makes cutting crown molding easier. I can image that it would really help a novice.The real advantage to this jig is the ability to re-set it for different molding. But if you are just cutting just one or two different sizes of molding, I suggest that you make a box out of some scrap plywood. It shouldn't take much more than 10-15 minutes if you have a table saw. You'll save $40 and can then take your significant other out for dinner.As another reviewer suggested, attach this jig to the saw so it doesn't move. I used heavy duty double-stick tape with great results."
3,Good but not great!,"It's one of a few of the good DIY'ers remedies to cutting crown moulding. I only wish that it would be able to hold the moulding tighter once it is in the device. Perhaps if the bench Dog's 10-010's ""fence risers"" and ""crown stop"" had some softer rubber attached to them or were made of softer rubber in general it would hold the moulding much better in place than what it does."
5,Crown Cuts Made Easy,"I tried a few crown molding jigs before buying this one, and this is the best I've used so far. Once set for the crown size you're working with, the cuts are quick and accurate because you're working with standard right/left miter cuts and not bevel cuts."
1,very bad design really frustrated,"I am returning that junk. Tried to do left cut inside corner, could not cut all the way (my saw is 10 inches) don't see how it can be cut all the way (5 inch wide molding). I wasted my money and time. ""OK"" if you want to cut not too wide crown molding. Seems they just rush the prouduct without testing all variations of crown moldings and 10 inch mitter saws. Dont waste your money get something else."
5,bought too late,"I just finished 30 door crowns using cove molding. I really didn't know these jigs existed. So, after finishing all these cuts manually, I bought this jig. Wish I had it a month ago. Much more consistant cutting - the wood stays in place."
5,Great dark thriller,"Read this on a long flight. Loved it. Dark story, great writing, plenty of twists. Highly recommended."
2,Not so good for $30,"I purchased this case for my new IPod 60 gig Photo and it fits like a glove and has relatively good protection properties. The good thing is it protects it from falls, I have dropped mine three times. The bad thing is that it fell because of the ridiculously flimsy belt clip. The belt clip is both cheap and not very strong and the last time it fell the clip assembly exploded. As I would not trust a $500 gadget hanging on the thing after it repeatedly failed, I didn't really care at that point and just removed it. The case is fine in that it protects the IPod and has an easily removable / swing open door for the disc control. It does get very dirty, however, as the material is extremely tacky and picks up everything from lint to good ole' dirt so that you need to clean it regularly. Other than that I would not have any complaints, I just cannot recommend the case as for $30 I expected the clip to actually be functional."
2,Great Idea - Bad Design,"I was delighted with my ToughSkin for all of two hours. That's how long it took for the belt clip to break, rendering my new purchase worthless to me.The ToughSkin itself is rugged; I loved it. I should have waited before buying it, though ... on my last visit to an Apple dealership, they had a bin full of *just the ToughSkins,* for sale at a discount. When I asked about these, I was told, ""The belt clips break, and customers bring the ToughSkins back.""I should note I'm very careful with my IPod and accessories. I'm not rough on them. The clip just fell apart while I was walking down the street. Given other comments about the flimsy clips, this is clearly a design issue that Speck Products needs to address."
2,Not so hot,Of the various iPod cases I've tried I found this one to be the worst. The click wheel cover is impractical and annoying and the screen cover falls out all too easily. Using plastic in rubber hinges was a bad idea which simply does not work well.
4,Like a Glove,"The case itself fits very snug around the IPOD, and even gives it a better look. The only complaint that I have is that the plastic window that covers the dial pops open, and even falls off at times. I still give the case a 4 star rating, because I am a soldier in Iraq, and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my IPOD clean. If a product can keep something clean in Iraq, then I am guessing that it can keep things clean anywhere."
3,Oh My!,"This video is well done however I am really looking to review Keli's kickbutt combat which I am in the middle of watching and had to take a break from. I'm having difficulty watching the female to Keli's left. I cannot believe how awful her form is. Is she there to demonstrate the incorrect way to kick, punch, etc.? I expect to see correct demonstration on a video. Kelly is awesome as usual but as 16 year group fitness instructor I found it so distracting to watch the young woman, I wanted to jump in and correct her or have the person filming stop and inform Kelly."
3,Keli Roberts Step/Circuit Workout,"Keli Roberts puts together a tough, complete aerobic and toning workout with this tape. While the moves themselves are not too complex, the cues leave something to be desired. She tends to repeat the same moves ad nauseum, but the step segments only last 8 minutes at a clip, so it's not too tough to endure. The toning with resistance is super-effective and tough; you will feel muscles you forgot you had. The warm-up and cool down are okay, but there is a serious lack of leg stretching at the end. You will need to work on your hip flexors, rotators, hamstrings and quads on your own and give a little more time to your shoulders. Otherwise, very effective."
3,A CD for a ventriloquist?,"The act itself is great, but as he talks about in one of the acts, this just don't make sense. Why would you buy a CD of a ventriloquist act? Buy the dvd instead."
5,Howard is the funniest,"He is a rare artist that brings a rare act to comedy. We may not see another one like this for another 50 years, but Dunham was worth the wait."
4,Jeff Dunham is funny,I purchased these for my husband for Christmas. We've liked Jeff Dunham since we first saw him years ago. There is a bleeped out version to view - I really appreciated that.
3,not as good as the dvd,"the cd is really good but not as good as the dvd. i bought the cd thinking it would be just like the dvd, unedited and all. however to my surprise and somewhat disappointment, the cd is edited and chopped together at some times.there are moments where the cd just doesn't make sense unless you've seen the dvd or show on comedy central and they take out some really funny moments from all the puppets. my recommendation is stick with the dvd"
4,Hilarious,"I was a little skeptical about listing to a ventriloquist with no visual effects, but the way he changes his voice it is very distenctive and takes nothing away from the act. It is one the funniest shows ever."
4,Used Just As Good As New,I received my DVD as a used product and it came looking and working just like new for considerably less!! Have used these services before and will use them FOREVER! Great Job!
1,arguing with myself,"sorry to say I bought a CD instead of aDVD. Just by mistake, "" so "" not good ,you need to watch Jeff Dunham to enjoy. I have seen the DVD and it's great."
1,This is a CD not a DVD,I bought this thinking it was a DVD when it arrived I was dissapointed because it was a CD. I had already opened the CD so I can not return it! There is no where on the discription that say that it is a CD.
1,Not really Karaoke!,This does not work in a dvd player and no words are included to follow. I do not consider this product karaoke. Don't waste your money.
5,Learn about telemedicine and telehealth,"Conceptually, the answer to many of health care's challenges lie in the use of new information technologies. Knowing this is the case and making it happen are two very different entities. This book ably bridges these two entities. The devil, as always, is in the details and the authors deftly elaborate the problems and provide solutions. I recommend this book to practitioners, administrators, managers and policy makers who are energetic and enthusiastic about the future direction of health care. Errol L. Biggs, Ph.D., Director - Programs in Health Administration, University of Colorado"
5,Donna,"These lights are wonderful. No more worrying about someone coming to my door at night without being seen. No more worrying about getting home and not being able to find my keys because it's dark and we forgot to turn on the porch light. They were not hard to install at all.Heath Zenith SL-4305-BK Motion-Activated Five-Sided Porch Light, Black Brass with Frosted Glass"
1,Quit working after 3 mo.,"I bought this item at a big box retailer and installed it on my front porch. It worked great for about 3 months and I felt so smart becuase it was inexpensive. Then it quit working altogether. It senses me approaching, flashes on for half a second, blinding me, and then goes out. Very frustrating. I don't recommed this product or brand."
2,Light does not work as permoted.,"This light looks good, but will only come on when you are directly under. If you change the Sensitivity It will come on and stay on the second time it is tripped.Had two electricians try to figure out what is wrong and they could not.Not worth the money."
1,small bulbs,"This lamp takes 4 candelabra bulbs (not supplied) that are difficult to find!find another model, this is not for practical applications!"
5,Let there be light - just right,"Installed this product at my mom's. It went in easily in about 15 minutes. Works just great. Has several settings to control length of time light is on and a sensitivity trigger. Sensor trigger does provide 360 degree coverage, it comes on when she leaves the house or when she arrives back at the house. She has no complaints about this unit"
4,Easy way to stop outlet drafts,"These will stop most of the draft coming from outlets. They don't stop it fully, but they can be installed very easily, as opposed to try and seal the electric box, or to replace it with an airtight one once the wall is finished."
1,A boring novel,"As a freshman in university, I thought this would be a funny novel, but I was completely wrong. This is one of the most horrible books I have ever read; so bad in fact, that I was tempted to use it as toilet paper after 20 pages in to it. But I read it all, and was bored and regretful that I had bought it by the time I finished."
1,Getting In - Aargh!,"I was in the library today, and the attractive cover of this book interested me. I picked it up, started reading it in Physics and was finished by Government. A quick read -- simplistic characters and an aimless plot tend to save time. Think Princeton Review's College Guide with some gratuitous sex thrown in. Then again, anyone who can write, ""His wiener was giant in there, like some burrowing gopher trying to dig its way out of his underwear"" with any seriousness whatsoever deserves accolades. A pity Boylan didn't begin the book with that sentence. He'd have won the Bulwer-Lytton contest easily."
2,Not Great - Read She's Not There,I read the bio She's Not There (by the same author) and it's fantasic! I loved the writing style and the way the story was told so I decided to see what else had been writen. Getting In looked cute so I gave it a chance. It's not a terrible book but it's not the kind of thing I made all my friends read either. If your looking for a great well written book I hightly recomment She's Not There instead.
5,"Fresh and funny, a romp in the college hay","Not quite believable, but very recognizable characters struggling with life stretching within and beyond their families, on the college tour circuit."
1,Dont waste your money,I bought this drive because of its high speed and good look. As one of the reviewer pointed out the the joints are made of poor quality material and it came off within a month and soon it will be unusable. I am returning it.
2,Very bad purchase,"I was expecting a little more smooth control to this flash drive but it is so frustrating. Some of the features did not even work with my jumpdrive such as hiding the ""secure"" drive. I can never safely remove my drive from my computer because it always says it cannot. The instructions say that the ""secure"" drive needs to be hidden in order for to safely remove it but it doesn't work. It always takes so long just to get the thing safely out of my computer. I could just pull it out but I'm afraid it could lead to data loss.The encryption seems to be the only real feature that works properly but everything else seems too clunky. I regret ever buying this device. Go with sandisk."
3,"OK Album, Weird Singer","Although the Album sounds ok, please avoid video clips, photos or any other contact with the singer.If this is just for listening, it is not a bad choice. Has 2-3 hits!"
2,You have to be a die hard fan to appreciate this DVD ....,"The DVD sports surround sound ... dolby digital ... etc etc but those fans that are aficionados of music DVD's and true surround sound will be in for a severe disappointment. Not on is the video questionble quality, I've seen better video equipment used by undergarduates of film studies, but the sound .. the sound .. is bad bad bad ....I mean give me a break I had to take the DVD and check out id this was cut in two channel stereo. The producerc should be ashamed of themselves ... maybe becaus their office is near the Miami airport they really never listened to this DVD!So unless,as I said, you are a die hard fan that would even love to hear Luis Miguel sing with his mouth taped shut .... don't waste your hard earned cash !"
5,Luis Miguel is Love,"Although I don't speak or understand much Spanish, it isn't necessary to love Luis' music. His heart and soul cries out through each song and every note. I could listen to and watch Luis forever!!"
2,"An Okay Dvd, Luis Miguel is the Frank Sinatra of Mexico!","I really like Luis Miguel and I have bought all of his Music Cds, I love to hear (Dvd movie) Concerts on my Home Theater system, I have spend thousands of dollars to trying to get the best sound, and sincerely this DVD falls short on my spectations and doesn't take advantage of it. You can barely hear different sounds coming from up to 6 different speakers but the sound it's not really DTS sound, it sounds more like dolby surround coming out from 6 (or 7) speakers. the quality of sound is in my ipinion very poor. I think Luis Miguel deserves better, tow tumbs down to the company that makes this Dvd. Luis Miguel's Music is Great, the sound is...... that's way I am giving this Dvd a low score."
5,The Best Live Performer Ever!!!,"I thought Luis Miguel's El Concierto DVD was good. Vivo is even better. His performance here is just astounding. He is the only performer who can make a studio recording sound better live! I love the uptempo medley of songs consisting of Un Hombre Busca Una Mujer, Cuestion De Piel and Oro De Ley. His live version of Tu Solo Tu is way better than the CD version. Everyone who loves Luis Miguel should have this DVD and for those who haven't discovered this amazing singer. Do yourselves a favor and order it now!!!"
2,BEWARE OF REGION CODE!!!!,The Amazon Ad states Region 1. What I received was a Region 4 and does not work inthe USA. My advice is to contact the seller first to be sure it is the correctregion for wherever you reside. I complained and Amazon gave me am immediate full refund as well as paying for the return shipping.
5,Great concert,"Luis Miguel is the latin Sinatra. This concert contains all of his famous songs and more. The sound is great and the camera angles and public shots are very good. If you like Luismi, this concert is a must have."
4,"Great product, shipping was high","Great product, these bulbs burn much brighter than the ones I replaced. However, the shipping was more expensive than the bulbs themselves, that's the only down side."
4,Great product for the most part,I bought this for my ipod photo 40 gb. So far it seems to be a good product. Protects the ipod well and fits well. My only complaint is that there is nothing to protect the screen. While that might not be that important for some for others who carry it around it just means you'll have to be careful. Also its a little expense for what it is. 30 bucks for this when 15 to 20 would be more reasonable.
2,Good but not good enough,"If you're looking for a case to provide protection and keep your iPod free of scratches, this one can serve the purpose. The optional/removable hard plastic screen and wheel covers are a nice feature. The case fits well over a 40 gig 4G iPod.Contrary to the product's web site, iTrip will NOT work with the case. I was so excited with the claim on www.speckproducts.com that iTrip will function normally with this case. However, it clearly does not fit.Overall, a great case if you don't plan to use iTrip. I've returned mine and the search continues..."
3,Isn't Exactly What I Wanted,"This was made for the first generation ipod. It doesn't exactly fit my 5th generation 30gb ipod. I put another slip cover on it first then put it in this cover, it works well now."
5,AWESOME K-LO!,"Kimberley has such a pure voice on this song! It is not oversung like most of the other former contestants- she stays the same, just stronger. The video to this song is great- visit launch@yahoo. K-Lo had my votes back in 2003 and still has them now!"
4,the girl has a voice,"The songs touch so many emotions,every song has a insperational message. My alltime favorite song on this CD is her version of ""I cant make you love me"" its a more up beat than Bonnie Raitt version , I really think if they would release her version as her next single I think it could be a # 1 hit for her. Im looking forward to her next cd release."
5,Kimberley locke is amazing!,"Kimberley Locke has one of the best voices in music to come around in a long time.. these remixes are really excellent also! Kim has had numerous appearances on television and her career is going strong. Can't wait for her next cd where she can showcase her talent. I am so glad Kimberley is recording, also check out her single on the Disneymania 3 cd, it is breathtaking!"
1,"Overrated non-talent, like The Duck!","The girl is tone-deaf and off-key and she can't sustain notes; in short: she can't sing. She's untalented and fat, and as someone has pointed out, is better off in law school where she can practice her being obnoxious. She's no different from that other overrated non-singer Donald Duck Barrino."
1,"Overrated non-talent, like The Duck","Ugly voice, can't hold notes, doesn't have range. Arrogant, too. Behaves as if she's already made it when she's no better than a trying-hard starlet. Overrated non-talent, like The Duck."
3,Show your love,"This set will show everyone at the track who you are rooting for right away. The scanner itself is pretty cool, the front shell slides down to reveal the numbers to punch in for frequencies. It is not preprogrammed. You can store frequencies (I did mine by driver number), but if you change the batteries, they have to be redone (minus one star). I have a hard time keeping the earbuds in my ear, they fall out everytime I try to put the headphones on over top (minus the second star)."
1,Easy to cut through,"Somebody cut through this lock last night, looks like one snip with a bolt cutter. Do not buy this lock if you expect it to keep your bike from being stolen."
3,Lock works fine but bracket broke,The lock works great but the bracket that holds the lock on my bike broke in less than 12 hours. I am not able to use the bracket anymore
2,You get what you pay for,"I think I paid like $7 for this thing, with $3-4 of it coming from shipping costs. The cables thin, the lock seems week, and my password is essentially 1234, but nobody knows that and my bike hasn't been stolen yet."
3,"Unique, Keep Your Eyes on the Dialogue",LOOKIN' IN THE MIRROR is an interesting tale about two different people looking for their place in life. Ms. Hatter penned this tale in a very unique way. It is written in a drama/soap opera style. Victoria is a young lady who knows what she wants and is willing to go after it. Gerald is a man looking for love in all the wrong places. The dialect will leave you laughing and holding your side.
5,Made a great gift !,"I gave this CD to my cousin(a teenage composer)on the advice of his mother. He and his Dad were over the top crazy about it and listened to it over and over. Of all the Happy Fella CD's I could have chosen, I'm glad this is the one I picked !"
1,this is not a good recording as it doesn't have all the songs,Don't spend the money for this inferior recording which misses some of the best songs.
4,A well written gothic romance,"If you are a fan of Daphne DuMaurier or the Bronte sisters, you will enjoy this new book by Rebecca Brandewyne. Upon a Moon Dark Moor is the story of Margaret Chandler, a young girl living with her widowed father, Sir Nigel Chandler, on an estate on the moors of Cornwall, England. When Sir Nigel remarries, several new people enter Margaret's life and change it dramatically. Ms. Brandewyne spins a captivating story that includes human drama, romance, and a little mystery. Although main characters' romance didn't really ring true with me the labryinthe story and the well-written characters compensated for that. A good read for a rainy fall day!"
1,i couldn't get past the first 100 pages,"actually i think i stopped at page 98, right about when the heroine met draco.this book is boring, it has no action. i usually finish every book i read; i have never met a book i didn't like. i didn't like this one.if you want a book like this read 'wuthering heights'. heathcliff and catherine are so wonderful. i feel the author was trying to remake 'wuthering heights' and perhaps that's why i didn't like it. too many similarities. almost exactly.it was just dull and drab, i'm sad to say. i'm taking this one back to the used bookstore and trading it in for a kathleen woodiwiss book. i'm sad too because so many people seem to like rebecca brandywine. maybe i'll give her another try with another book.this one was just ... drab."
3,The Sequel is Better,"This book wasn't Brandewyne at her best (""Love, Cherish Me"")or near best (""Across a Starlit Sea"", ""Forever, My Love,"" ""Desire in Disguise""). But it wasn't her worst either... better than some of her recent ones.The second book in this series, ""Across a Starlit Sea,"" was much, much, better. And it was leading up to a third book which looked like there would be a big payoff, but the 3rd book never came out! Does anyone know why?I would really like to know what happened to the third book in this trilogy and also to the third book in Brandewynes fantasy romance ""Passion Moon Rising"" trilogy. If anyone has information please post it on this site."
2,A Disappointment,"Having read a couple of Rebecca Brandewyne's books before, I opened this one with great anticipation. From the beginning, I felt the characters and plot had considerable potential, but it didn't take long to begin feeling let down. I wanted to experience Maggie's life with her, to understand her thoughts, feelings, and motivations. It seemed impossible, however, to connect her thoughts and feelings with her behavior. Everything just seemed... off. I couldn't believe in her romance with Draco because it didn't seem natural. It seemed forced. Misunderstandings and conflicts were not cleared up to my satisfaction. The thoughts and feelings of the characters changed conveniently, but not believably. I would not read this book again and would not recommend it."
5,Flabbergasted in Atlanta,"I agree with the fan from London. I have the tape cassette of ""As I Watch U Dance"", but would very much like to get this on disc. I was appalled to realize it's not available!"
4,A personal journey of connecting the present with the past,"This book is one of the only sources I could find that describes the impact of colonization on the individual psyche. Written by a Native (Canadian) woman who is a recovering alcoholic, this book chronicles the journey of connecting the present to the past. Hill examines the role that colonization of native people plays in the individual lives of modern indigenous people. By examining the destruction of kinship systems, spirituality, and tribal affiliation, the author finds the sources of much of the abuse, alcoholism, and suicide among native people today."
4,atomic clock,It shows accurate time and temp. But its frame size is not large enough.it's cool..I like it!!
5,atomic clock,"I loved this clock so much I plan to purchase at least 2 more, and this is my 2nd identical clock. Offers much information....."
4,Excellent Clock,"This clock works very well and the temperature functions are quite handy. It took a day or so for the time to sync with the radio signal, but since then it has been maintenance free and has functioned nicely. Very satisfied."
5,Works great,Great clock with temperature. The person who received this really enjoys it and it was just what they wanted.
4,Quick and Accurate,"Great for a home office. It does have difficulty receiving the signal from the atomic clock center if it is placed too close to a computer or other electrical device such as tv, monitor, printers, etc. But if you shut these devices off at night there should be no problem."
5,happy shopper,We enjoy having all that info readily available and accurately especially for a detailed guy. I also ordered LaCrosse Atomic clock for my daughter.
4,Great Clock,"Requires a little manual intervention (setting the time zone, date, and the year). Remember to install batteries in the remote first before installing (replacing) batteries in the clock."
5,Atomic Wall Clock,Nice piece of equipment and very easy to set up and came with good instructions. Nice big numbers too. I use it out on the lanai.
2,La Crosse Technology WS8117U-it-al,"can not get then outside temp,maybe someone can help me find out what the problem is. also I thought it would set to day light saving time"
5,big,"I didn't look at the dimensions for this clock--it is huge! Would have preferred something a little smaller, but it works great. The remote sensor is in our third garage bay, through the garage and a couple of walls away, and the main clock monitors its reading just fine. Haven't used the moon phase at all."
4,So far so good,Everything seems to work as advertised. I took off 1 star only because the thermometer tends to always show 2 or 3 degrees warmer than the rest of my thermometers around the house. My other thermometers are all different brands but all read the same so I beleive it is this one that's off.Other than that I am very happy with the clock.
2,thermometer is waaay off,the thermo for the outside is about 20 deg. off higher than the true temp. The clock is great as is the moon phase
4,Very good clock,I purchased the La Crosse Technlogy atomic wall clock because about two years ago I bought a clock by La Crosse and really liked its dependablility. So far the clock has been great the only complaint is that it takes a few tries to get all of the functions set.
3,Works fine for now,"I expected another cheap Chinese made product, which it is but it seem to work just fine. The the low battery indicator came on in both the sending and receiving units within days of installing new batteries. But it is still working fine. Since I've only had it a few weeks I'm holding judgement because as I have experienced before with cheap Chinese made electronic they do not stand the test of time and usually fail. What I really bought it for was the atomic clock as my wrist watch one failed and I like having the correct time."
2,"Can""t get a signal",I live in NY and I can't get an atomic clock signal. Where doyou put the remote if it's not water proof?
4,Digital Wall Clock,"A great clock with large type that can be seen across the room. Since it has a wireless connection for outside temps, the clock can be placed anywhere. Radio reset means hands-off when day-light saving ends. A real value!"
1,"nice appearence, doesn't really work","They have been around for some time. My first one seemed fine until DST when I found out it did not adjust ""atomically"" as advertised, but just used the calendar. I could have set that manually if it had allowed me to choose a time zone east of Boston. After extensive email activity, LaCrosse sent me another one. It truly noticed something changed on the correct DST date - it turned wildly for more than 24 hours. Eventually I pulled the battery to stop that. After letting any residual charge leak out for a week, I hoped it would reset, but it never did. I've given up on it."
3,Doesn't work in San Antonio??? - Great in CLT!!,I have one in Clt N.C and it is WONDERFULI shipped one to San Antonio and they cannot get it to get a signal.What's up and how do I get help for them?
1,Review of Shipping Deal not Item,I purchased this item in early December for Christmas. It qualified for the Super Free Shipping deal they were running at the time. It took over three weeks for this item to be shipped. I didn't receive it until Christmas Eve. I will NEVER use Amazon again unless they improve their so called FREE SHIPPING Offers. It was not worth the headache or anxiety that it caused.
1,Atomic clock NOT!,The clock arrived almost a week ago. Just for grins I did not set the time so I could see when it updated itself to the correct time. It still hasn't. So much for checking every night. I suspect the problem is that we are in Boston and Colorado is a long ways away. It probably works fine for most of the country. I put it in a West facing window just in case. Otherwise this looks like a good clock and the wireless outdoor thermometer is cool but I bought it for the automatic update feature.
3,Dim,This digital indoor outdoor clock/thermometer is somewhat dim. It is almost useless in a darkened TV room. I have bought from this manufacturer before and never encountered this problem. Just not enough contrast. Other than that it is functional.
2,Wont pick up exterior temp,"Gave as a gift and was recently told it wont pick up the exterior temperature. I have tried new batteries and resetting it, but nothing. Nice look, but not working."
5,Bought it only for its outdoor temperature feature and LOVE IT!,"I've had this for a few weeks now and LOVE the temperature monitoring. Very nice if you are running errands and need to quickly see what the outside temperature. However, I like to know a days high and low temperature to see what kind of coat I will need for me and my 2 year old so sometime I end up opening the weather app on my phone. Add the high and low feature to this clock and I will become customer for life.Also the silver clock isnt the best looking in a bedroom, I think it suits more in the kitchen area. The wooden one looks good for the bedroom."
4,Good but short lived,"This atomic clock is my third for this brand and the second for this model. I love this clock model but the clocks just don't last very long. Each has lasted about a year, the length of the warranty. Another brand I bought has lasted longer, but is not as easy to find. Since I got the LaCrosse on sale both times that I have bought this model, then the cost hasn't been too bad. The display is easy to read and batteries last as long as the clock. The sensors work well."
5,Easy set up,"I wanted an indoor - outdoor temperature reading. The range on the remote is better than a previous model that I had. I just hung it on a wall, placed the remote on our front porch and in a day it had adjusted itself. Looks good, easy to set up, appears accurate, what more could you want."
4,"Works great, but small.","I bought this clock to replace another LaCrosse clock that I had purchased years ago. I like how this one looks. It's just a good bit smaller than the last one and it's harder to read the numbers up on the wall (I have it placed over the patio door). It works well, though. Very easy to set up. I also miss the humidity level that I had on the last one. Overall I would buy it again, but would look for one that is a bit bigger next time."
1,Atomic Clock,"Clock has very good appearance, but external temperature function did not work. Manual, which arrived with clock, instructs users to call La Crosse Technology if there are problems. Not very helpful. When a user calls them, they take your information and tell you someone shall call you back in a few business days. Waited a few days and no call. I returned the clock to Amazon. Amazon promptly credited my credit card account for the purchase price. It's been over a month now and still no call from La Crosse. My clock was probably an isolated defect, but I would not buy another La Crosse product because of the non-existent product support."
5,Exactly what I needed,"All I needed was a wall clock for the master bath that didn't tick so I could hear it in the bedroom. What a got was a cool clock that is easily readable from the shower, doesn't keep me awake with noise or glow at night, and has the added bonus of inside/outside temp. The moon thing is kind of cool too; I've noticed the moon at night a little more, even though I'm not really paying attention to the phases. Great clock for telling you how late you are for work and not keeping you up at night."
4,Size of display,"I like this clock very much. It was easy to set up. Instead of the moon phases, I would have preferred larger indoor/outdoor temp and date, like the older version had."
4,works like a clock,"It works like a clock, because it is intended to: it is a clock.Sometimes it looses the satelite signal, but I guess that is a feature and when Sun is out - it is a little difficult to filter the real signal from Sun's noise. Considering that even without a satelite signal for few hours a day it works perfectly - this is not an issue. The display's contrast ratio is good, clock is very visible even under sunlight."
5,Works as designed,Just make sure you read instruction on how to set it up before you try to do it on your own - will save you some time.
1,La Crosse Technology WS-8117U-IT-AL,The Remote Temperature sensor doesn't work on either of them more than 3 feet away. All around a piece of junk.La Crosse #WS-8117U-IT-AL Digital Clock/TemperatureLa Crosse #WS-8117U-IT-AL Digital Clock/Temperature
3,not entirely happy,"LOVE the clock, the way it looks, large display, temperature and moon phases etc.Problems are: the DST will not turn off. Even though the DST is set to off every night at 12 the clock searches for the signal and resets to an hour behind. Very annoying so I put the clock next to my computer so that it prevents the clock from picking up the signal!The outdoor temperature sensor only worked for the first 3 days - this is not really a big deal to me.I wrote La Crosse for help and they never wrote me back.I still love the clock, just wish everything worked as it should."
2,Didn't work as promised.,"This atomic clock has a nice clear display and it's very attractive. I have not been able to get the outdoor sensor to transmit to the clock. I called LaCrosse Technology it was busy, I left a message, they never called back. I called another time and finally got through, the lady that answered the call, asked me what the expiration date on the AA batteries that I was using was. I told her 2011, she told me they are too old and that I needed to buy batteries with a date of 2013 or later. I bought a set of 2013 batteries and still the sensor does not work. I just sent them an e-mail about the problem on 02/12/09, I hope they will respond and send me a replacement outdoor sensor. If this does not work, I will return the whole thing back to Amazon."
4,Pretty Close to perfect,This thing works great except for the temperature gauge requires you to set up an outside device. So if you use the clock in an office build like I do the feature has to be abandoned.
4,The Lacrosse Weather station 8117u-C,This is a great product but set up can be challenging. I would advise anyone to change out the batteries promptly after a year of use. I have two of these and it has been really useful to have a nice looking clock with the inside and outside temp displays as well as indicator showing which way the weather is going.
1,Clock,"Purchased from Amazon.The product is set for EST, but can't get it to reset for Pacific Time zone, so is not usable.Have been a customer of Amazon for several years under this email address & bankjpc1@att.net, mostly DVD's & a few other items, all at this mailing address."
1,Outside temp does not work,I had trouble for years with the reliability of the outside temperature. I purchased a new clock from Amazon recently hoping that the new outside temp sensor would work for both clocks. It did work for a couple days. I see lots of other reviewers are experiencing the same problem and the support from La Crosse Technology is poor. I am returning the clock to Amazon for a full refund. Thank you Amazon for your return policy.
3,Eats batteries but it does work,Have it on the wall in my office and have gone through 4 sets of batteries in a year. Works well and looks nice on the wall. I can read it easily from across the room.
5,Great clock,Look good and very visible. Exterior Temp works great.Note: Interior temp sensor is built in the clock so temp differs from where you stand by 5 deg as it reads the air around the clock.
3,La Crosse clock died after 3 1/2 years,"Purchased this in March of 2009 and was used in my son's bedroom. A couple of weeks ago, after replacing the batteries, the clock was observed to be stucked at 6:00 and can't seem to fix it. I have 6 of La Crosse atomic clocks still working around the house (2 digital and 4 analog) and have probably retired 2 others after they died. I am giving 3 stars for great use but not for long life.Can't wait for Daylight Savings to end as I love the convenience of not having to change my clocks. Just wished it lasted a lot longer."
2,Outside Temp Reaing Failed,The clock has a sleek design and works fine except for the outside temp reading. It worked great for two weeks then failed. Changed batteries twice but never got it working again. Had to return product.
1,Have to change batteries every month,I may have got a defective piece. I had the problem of having to change the batteries every month.Unfortunately it happens after the return window hence you are stuck with it.
1,temperature remote doesn't work,The temperature remote reports outrageous temperatures and only for 5 minutes every few days.....What a piece of junk.The remote now has a huge melted bubble on it where something shorted out ?
3,atomic clock with indoor/outdoor temp,"I have had many La Crosse items before and have been very satisfied. We cannot set up the correct time on this one. We live in MO., and in order to get the correct time, I had to set it up as EST with no DST. So, twice a year, when the time changes, I will have to manually change it. Very disappointed in La Crosse!"
4,La Cross Technology Atomic Wall Clock,This clock has alot of features. It is alot larger than I thought it would be. I should have looked at the specs much closer. I can see it clearly from across the kitchen.
1,Shabby Quality,"If La Crosse made this clock with any care it would be a really nice product. For several years, I've had a slightly different model with wood accent panels instead of brushed aluminum and when the remote temperature sensor is working, it's quite useful. I've gone through several remote sensors, however, at $16 plus shipping apiece, and the clock seems to be unable to pick up the signal from the sensors in many cases even when the sensor is less than 10' away in line of sight through a window. Then the sensors stop working altogether for no good reason. Not optimal performance. The unit is well designed, lovely to look at it, but its remote temperature sensor and the corresponding receiver in the main unit are shabbily manufactured and unreliable. Anyone interested in a remote temperature sensor would be well advised to look for a different manufacturer."
1,Clock does not work.,The clock keeps changing to a different time zone and the purchase disappeared from my record so I could not return it on Amazon. I am stuck with a clock that does not work properly. Failing grades for both La Crosse and Amazon. I am very dissapointed.
5,I and my wife love this clock/thermometer,"I was hesitate in choosing La Crosse clocks with outdoor thermometer due to some negative comments out there. But decided to give it a try due to their good looking/design. I bought a WS-8117U-IT-C and a WS-8418AL-IT. It turns out that setup was so easy, and it worked instantly. I gave the second one to my son as a gift. It was nice product and really works great! Now the first thing my wife does in the morning is to look this La Crosse for outdoor temperature and dress up our daughter accordingly."
2,mixed bag,"The time and the indoor thermometer work well. But the outdoor thermometer has not worked. I have called the company several times, but received only one response and that not helpful. Disappointing product."
4,Wall Clock,"This is a pretty good clock. The display is smaller than I expected but it's good enough. It comes with a temperature monitor which I haven't used yet. The build quality of the clock is nice. However, the temperature monitor feels cheap to me. The whole package was priced pretty good though so I'm happy with the purchase."
3,Nice Clock,"I just wish it would light up a bit in the dark so I can tell what time it is. Oh well. I should have realized this, but it would make a better clock if it was somewhat illuminated at night"
4,"Large display, elegant design","Have this hanging in my bathroom to replace an old analog clock who's ""tick tock"" noise drove me batty(er). Love the large scale numbers and the easy to read display - perfect when I haven't put my contacts in yet! The outdoor temperature guage is a great feature. The moon cycles are cool, but the display is counter intuitive - full BLACK circle is supposed to indicate full boom, while a full white (grey) circle is meant to indicate New Moon. Huh?"
5,"Great for Wall, Simple and Easy to Read","I bought one of these a long, long time ago. It recently failed. I thought it was the transmitter since it is outdoors in the elements. New batteries in both (following the propoer sequence) didn't help either.I really like this device. It's greatest asset is that it simple, and legible from a reasonable distance. I don't need a lot of extraneous ""stuff"" in a clock, the time and temp would be fine, thank you. This unit fits the bill perfectly (yes, I don't care for the phases of the moon, but alas it comes with it). So much so, that I am ordering a replacement.If I get 6-7 years out of the new, I'll likely order another, maybe with bigger letters and numerals needed by then !!!!Fits its intended purpose well - highly recommend it, even after the failure."
1,Do not buy this clock,This is a useless POS. The outdoor temp function worked for 5 days. Sometimes the clock won't set correctly. Customer service has produced a series of boilerplate emails. The only good thing is that I don't have much invested in it. I intend to get my money's worth out of it with a large hammer.
2,Not Pleased!!,"As some other customers in their reviews already mentioned, the ouside temp. transmiter does not work properly. Will go for another brand!"
1,Outside temp will not work.,The outside temperature transmitter does not work. I followed the instructions numerous times and this thing just isn't any good. Its a waste of money. Buy another brand.
5,Atomic Wall Clock,"Great! Looks great and is easy to program and install. Had one before, but this one looks better on the wall. The black is a nice accent and the numbers are big enough that I can read them from bed without my glasses."
3,Atomic Clock,The clock was very nice. It just did not sit up straight enough. I could not read the numbers from where I wanted to put it. It should be hung on the wall or placed somewhere lower.
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!,"I bought it and used it for 3 months. First of all, for over $30, this is a very cheap clock. It's extremely light and feels as if it's going to break with the slightest movements. The display is terrible, with some of the parts cutting out, and in general, it is just not a good clock."
1,HORRIBLE clock.,"I was so excited when I ordered this clock, but after the first month the outdoor sensor stopped working so we had no more outdoor Temp. Also this thing burns through batteries like nothing. After about a month on a fresh pair the clock start displaying totally wrong times because it's already killed the batteries and wants to eat another pair. Into the trash with this thing!!!"
5,"Great buy, one of two in my home. Guess I have to add more words here?",Well worth the money spent; an on/off backlight would make this a bullseye buy.Took my wife awhile to appreciate the functionality of the unit.
3,Nice to have it!,"Nice atomic clock! However, it came first time indoor temperature couldn't be read so we returned and got another one. The design fit my nicely renovated room."
2,Terrible Service from La Crosse,"I have had this product before and it worked great so I ordered a second one for a different location. On the second one the remote sensor would not display the outdoor temp. I went on line and tried everything that was recommended on the web site. Nothing worked so I contacted La Crosse customer support. I could not find a phone number so I sent an e-mail. It took two weeks to get a canned e-mail response telling me to try all the things that I had already tried. I was convinced the sensor was defective so I ordered a second one. The second one didn't work either so I am convinced something is wrong in the Clock. After another 10 days went by with no response from La Crosse so I returned everything to Amazon. Amazon is fantastic on returns.These devices are great when they work but if it doesn't, don't waste time with La Crosse customer support."
1,poor customer service-- don't buy it,The outdoor temperature sensor stopped working within 6 months. Customer service response has been slow and unsatisfactory. Basically I am stuck with a non-working temperature guage.
3,decent,this is ok. i just want to have a big wall clock with no ticking sound.this one is not big as i thought. cant glow in the dark. instead of black numbers they should make it with a bit glowing silver color. so at least you can tell what time when you only little light on in your bedroom. plus the outside temp sensor is not weather proof. where are you gonna put it then? so..i say forget it....just happy with the clock.
4,"Great features. month and day too small, Nice wood Finish","Before I had a digital clock from Radio Shack and the month and day were very large. I'm not old, but I was just used to the larger display, hence the 4 stars. Cause I really don't care about the moon, since I'm not a vampire, but it's a good product, so far.The wood casing makes it look more expensive and warm also."
2,clock,"This clock is okay. The size is great. It takes quite some time for the clock to ""download"" (about 24 hours for the moon phase) and the outdoor temperature gauge didn't work."
3,Attractive looking accurate digital wall clock,"This clock has worked very good for 2 years. It is still working after 3 years and the time is still atomically synced, but the outdoor temperature sensor stopped working after about 2 years and it is not displayed on the clock. I changed the battery in the sensor and tried all suggestions in the manual and tried to sync it again, but could not get temperature back. I even called the manufacturer, but they were no help. Originally I mainly purchased it for the clock, but grew to like the outside temp feature. I would give it five stars if the temp still functioned."
4,Outdoor temp reader not working.,"I had recieved one as a gift a few years ago. About a year after having it, the outdoor temp reader went bizerk. Most of the time there are only 2 dashes where the temp should show. Sometimes, the number display counts from 0 to 59 continuously. Overall, if the outdoor temp continued to work, I would purchase it again. I love how large the numbers are-very easy to read across the room."
4,"Very affordable, weather fanatic friend",this product is great for people who like to keep up with the weather. It shows the moon phase and date and indoor/outdoor temp. And you'll never be late again with the atomic clock. Be sure to follow instructions specifically when first setting up or the outdoor temp won't be recognized.
1,Pain in the neck,I've now had this for about three months. I have to reset it weekly as the temperature sensor quits working and temperature reverts to indoor temp. Now it has quit altogether. I've tried replacing batteries and moving the unit and sensor and nothing helps. It is going to be returned!
5,Awesome product,The product is everythig I thought it would be. I especially love the fact that it shows the stages of the moon!
4,Weather station,This is an awesome indoor/outdoor weather station the clock is very large and the stages of the moon are great!
4,Better Than Expected,I have had the atomic clocks for a number of years now but none have been able to pick-up the WWVB signal. Within 10 minutes after placement of the batteries the clock had correctly set itself to the time signals. I have also verified this with the WWV time signals on the HF bands. It is exact.This was better than I had expected. I needed a large readout clock for my radio station and this one works great.
5,Works well,"I've had this clock/thermometer for about four months. It has worked perfectly. The clock display is a little larger than I was expecting, but I've grown to like it. I love knowing the outside temp. before heading out the door. I'm getting ready to order another to give as a gift."
4,compact system for time and temp,This replaced a wall clock and an indoor outdoor (with wire) thermometer with a compact unit and no wires. Love it!
4,Great product...flawed instructions,The gadget worksTwo issues --Don't place the sensor on a sunny outside wallThe instructions for setting the time zone are a little wonky. I'm pretty techy and had to call the help line (who were great).
2,Didn't last,"Well, when it worked it was great. The outdoor temperature sensor stopped working after about a year. The clock stopped working after about 2 years. Now I'm looking for a new clock."
2,Disappointed,"Worked well for about two years, then it would not display outdoor temperature and finally failed completely. Would not recommend."
2,Display much too dark,The display on the clock was way too difficult to see unless you were very close to it. My other atomic clocks have a much more visible display. I sent the clock back.
4,Indoor-Outdoor Thermometer,Works fairly well. Display seems to have some problems as part of numbers are faded or faint.
4,nice,"this is a nice looking clock--matches our decor, sits nicely on the counter. And nice to have an accurate one in the house"
1,Will this CD damage my computer?,I was told that this CD will damage my computer and it is not clear from the Amazon description if this is so.
1,One of the Worst,Wish I could return this CD - I sure won't be listening to it a second time! Although the melodies are nice - the robotic recitation of the lyrics leaves a lot to be desired. I prefer the old classics!
4,very good album,for a gift it was a good choice as long as the person likes the material of Neil Diamond
5,"thanks again, rick rubin!","neil diamond has always had a great voice. what he hasn't always had is a producer who can take that incredible voice and craft it into a great album. well, rick rubin is as good a producer as can be found. his work with johnny cash was astonshing. now mr diamond gets the same treatment. the resulting album is a stunning piece of work, showcasing a stark, uncluttered sound that is pristine and gorgeous. a great set of songs from beginning to end, sung with breathtaking sensitivity and skill. Q magazine selected this as the 19th best album of 2006. great stuff, indeed."
5,Best in 20 years,"I have always been a Neil Diamond fan; a love I inherited from my mother. I saw him in concert 3 times when I lived in Minnesota, once in '72, twice in the 80's. An amazing performer.This CD absolutely totally completely BLEW ME AWAY! I can't think of an album since You Don't Bring Me Flowers that comes close to this. In fact, I would put this right up there with Stones. Buy this and listen to it, again and again, and be stunned by the sheer genius that we all knew he had, showing in all its glory for the whole world to see."
1,My 2 year found this lame.,"My son recieved this for his birthday. It is a great idea but... the toys is pretty lame. The bubbles don't really float out they just kind of bubble up at the blower like kitchen sink suds. I think that my son walks too fast with it, if you walk very slowly like a new walker then the bubbles have a chance to blow out, but I don't think the push apparatus is sturdy enough for new walkers. My son can easily pull the handle bar out too. bvg"
4,Good Expansion Cage,"This is good as an add-on to another cage because of its smaller size. I removed one of the openings by switching it with a closed one because I wanted an opening for another one of my cages but didn't want to buy one of those metal add-a-door things. I also removed the metal wire bottom, it really isn't necessary anyway. My hamsters like this excersize wheel the most because it's a large size and 3 of them usually run on it at a time."
4,I will buy more books by Derek Prince,Derek Prince is so scholarly that you know if he said it then you can believe it won't be due to sensationalism or over-zealousness. Well written with scripture references throughout which is extremely important.
4,Warfare Tools,Has very good information that is hard to find elsewhere. Insightful on the deliverance ministry. Need to read twice to digest the info.
5,Primer on confrontational spiritual warfare,"A ""must-have"" for the library of every pastor, missionary or biblical counselor, this book very carefully explains the existence and work of demons, the power Christ demonstrated over them and the authority all believers have to command them to leave their victims. Unlike many televangelists and charismatic preachers, Derek Prince speaks with humility about the subject, asserting that whatever Jesus did is meant as an example for His followers.You'll see none of the shouting and flamboyant showmanship of the typical ""power encounter"" or exorcist endorsed in this book. All of his instruction comes from the Bible and is illustrated with examples from decades of personal experience in the ministry.Don't be afraid of this subject! Here is an author you can trust to make it understandable and accessible to you and others."
5,Essential for Deliverance Workers and All Christians,"This book is very Spiritually informative about how to be delivered and how to deliver others. Derek Prince tells much about how to be set free from Demons our spiritual enemies and how to stay free. How demons enter humans, Doorways, why some are not delivered, How to Break Curses and so on. It answers many common questions such as whether the Holy Spirit can indwell an unclean vessel.I found this book to be very rich in knowledge for those who aim to become deliverance ministers or those who want to set themselves free from demonic bondage."
2,From the Demon's Point of View,"As a third-level, Chronogistic Impaler subservient to the Dog-Lord Belial, I was skeptical that a book written by a mere human could capture the full Demon experience in all of its technicolor frenzy. But it does. In spades. What's more, it also serves the Master well by imparting sufficient false information to make it far more likely that a large number of silly persons will fall into His clutches.Eight spiked tails UP UP UP for this beauty of a read. Highly recommended, especially roasted. I like the book, too."
5,Deliverance Book,"If you are interested in the Deliverance Ministry , I highly recommend this book. Derek Prince is a very intelligent man and well educated. Great Book !!"
5,A Biblical Balanced Approach to Deliverance,"This book is essential reading for believers dedicated to carrying out The Great Commission of Mark 16. One of Jesus' instructions to His followers was to castout/expel demons in His name. Deliverance is part of the Gospel. This book addresses issues such as characteristics of demons, activities of demons and the big ""Hot potato"" of whether or not a Christian can have a demon. There are also accounts of the author's experience of ministering deliverance. Derek Prince draws on over 30 years experience in this ministry.The book concludes with practical steps one can take should they feel the need of deliverance.I recommend this book for lay-men and individuals alike."
5,This is all very inspirational!,"""Calvin and Hobbes"" is one of the very few comic classics to ever be published in newpapers nationwide. And with this second installment in the series, we have more of the duo's adventures and philosophies. From Calvin as an onion to Hobbes trying to be ""cool"", it's always good to be back in childhood once we're through with this book. Also, we get to see a bit more philosophical discussions between the six-year old and his stuffed tiger. An example would have to be when they discover that a huge chunk of forest has been destroyed by human tools.This is Bill Watteron's greatest achievement. It's sad that he ended the comic in 1995, but I respect his decision."
5,Hilarious Book!!!!,As a child I loved to read this book! And now I am buying it for my children to cherish one day. The Calvin and hobbes series is so incredibly funny you'll laugh out loud every time you pick it up. Take my word and buy this and other calvin and hobbes books. You won't regret it. PROMISE!
5,The best laughs for people who want to rekindle their youth.,"Watterson combines the reality of the adult-world, through Calvin's parents, and the imagination of Calvin, a kid, to put the truth into perspective. Susie, also realistic, tries to be friendly to Calvin, who rejects her attempt. However, Hobbes gets Susie's attention by being ""fuzzy and sweet""(p.25). a great book for anyone!!"
4,Incredible Crisp/Raw Sound,"I have been playing acoustic guitar for nineteen years, and these were recommended to me by a folk/bluegrass guitarist a little over a year ago. I gave them a shot, and now every time I try a different brand or gauge I keep coming back to these.I use the John Pearse 700M on my Gibson J200. They capture the bluesy tones just right if I'm playing technically, the crisp/warm tones if I'm fingerpicking, and they provide a great rhythmic backdrop for a backup folk guitar. Dynamically, they allow for my guitar to be big and beefy or soft and tender.The only drawback that I have is that these strings tend to go dead quickly. Since that is in large part my fault for having oily skin that corrodes and deadens any string, I should really give this string 4 and a half stars; but they don't give that as an option.I have been very satisfied, and changing the strings frequently has just become a part of my routine."
2,Disappointing!,He sounds like Justin Timberlake in this CD rather than his personal style. I agree with much that has been written here and I tend to think that this CD was catered for US charts. I'm not impressed with it and I also think his voice sounds much better in his native tongue of Turkish. This english CD sounds like it's going to be his only one. It's not bad but it's NOT Tarkan. If you're expecting a CD like Karma or Dudu this is nothing like them.
1,Tarkan is SO much better than this...,"OK, this is horrible. As a Turkish-American, I have been listening to Tarkan since I was about 16 (I am 30 now) and I absolutely adore his music. I was SO looking forward to this album- we have been saying that Americans would LOVE his style. This album, however, does not show his style and that ""je ne sais quoi"" that makes him a Euro-mega star. It sounds like a poor imitation of Britany Spears, N'Sync or Spice Girls circa 1999. Actually, I believe that some of his stuff resembles Wham from the early 80s, and again, not a flattering, fun Wham but a sad, poor imitation Wham. This album is the pits- American Customers, PLEASE oh PLEASE don't buy this, but please do buy ""Kuzu Kuzu"" or ""Sikidim"" or one of his other, older Turkish albums. Those are fantastic."
3,CD review,"This English version was quite disappointing at first, til I got used to it. I love his Turkish CD's, even though I can't understand them, On this CD, his music and songs sounded like a Michael Jackson wanna-be. I hate saying that since he is my favorite singer. I missed the Middle-Eastern background music, like those on his Turkish CD's. I'd rather he stick to his Turkish music----much better, instead of trying to be another American singer."
3,Ricky Rip Off,"Not the best Tarkan album of all time. Sounds like an pseudo version of his past albums. Why the terrible Wycliffe Jean addition, is it contractual or does Wycliffe feel that he has to appear on every ablum on the planet , take up painting if you are bored and stop ""singing"" on other people's aibums. Tarkan get back to your roots and sing in Turkish learn from Rickey's mistake and produce a good album."
3,Tarkan lost in hiphop,"This CD will not be loved by Turkish fans and Tarkan devotees. This CD is strictly for the US listeners. They've managed to kill Tarkan's voice and trademark style in hiphop and urban beats. He doesn't sing, he whispers on most tracks! Where is the voice Tarkan????"
5,Best Album of the Summer,"This album is one of the best I've ever heard.Why?Because Tarkan's albums have a seductive habit of growing on you. So what you buy today, you won't get tired of tomorrow (as in Britney Spears and other pop trash) - you'll grow to love it even more as time goes by.This album is an investment for the future.And once you're hooked - you just won't be able to stop listening to it.[...]"
2,A bit of disappointment...,"I have all of Tarkan's CD'S and I love them. But I must agree with the other review, what happened to his voice??? The beats of the songs hid his voice.... He lost his uniqueness; now he sounds like any other singer. :("
3,Virtuoso instrumentalist - mediocre album,"No one plays dobro like Jerry Douglas, but this album's all over the place and offers no coherent artistic statement. I can jam!I can play jazz! I can noodle on space music! There's Kenny G style saxophone for the new age set! There are some lovely moments here, but this is not an album for the ages."
2,A little dobro goes a long way,"Don't get me wrong, I love the dobro and JD is one of if not the best, but as far as this album is concerned my wife put it best. ""That music is really annoying."""
4,it's all here!,"this has all the classic ingredients for a gothic paperback.a pretty,orphan girl,three loony,older female cousins,dead father worship,creepy male characters,a real or imagined ghost and best of all-a skeleton buried secretly in a wall! this book lives up to it's provocative cover art. i hope someday someone will show it."
1,Had to be a j..,"LAREINE: A Bunch of japanese people trying to look Aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition..It's not gonna happen,guys.I know better."
2,This movie is a rental,"I did not understand the movie, there was no plot, nothing that made sence. If possible rent this movie."
4,Fun!,"I bought this for my nephew that is 18 months. He always wants to play with dads tools so I thought this would be fun. He loves it! The pieces aren't flat, they are raised up about an inch too. They are a little easier for little hands to get to."
5,Good Quality Toys,"I bought this puzzle for my 18 mnth old son. We have lotsa fun putting it together.We like the Melissa and Doug toys. They make brightly colored, durable toys that are easy for little figures to manipulate."
5,What a cute puzzle!,"We own several of these Melissa and Doug puzzles and they are all great! My son especially loves this puzzle, but he loves it more to play with the tools than to actually work the puzzle! The tools are cartoons, yet pretty realistic, so my son is able to identify the different tools. He often takes the hammer and starts hitting things with it, but I think that's okay because that's what hammers are for! I'd recommend this puzzle for any kid who loves tools!"
3,Not like the other ones...,"My son has six or seven of the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles and we love them. However, the tool puzzle that we received is NOT hand painted as described, and like all of the other ones that we have. Instead, the pieces have sticker pictures on them and several of them are already peeling off at the edges. (We got this today.) Durability aside this is a good product and I recommend it."
3,Chunky Puzzle,Very easy to use and put together. Was not that challenging for my son as he wanted to do something else after finishing it in 1 minute. Good puzzle though.
2,colorful and attractive but wont last very long,"I got this for my son who is just starting to enjoy puzzles. Initially he loved the fact that they were chunky and he could just do his ""tool work"" around the house. however, i was very disappointed by the fact there is not a paint but paper on wood for these parts. after a few days of use, the paper came from edges and they look unattractive.also the colored part if just on one side of the pieces. I understand that they are puzzles and not toy tools, but I think it would be a perfect if they can paint all sides to make it look like real tools.Overall, i think i would have been better getting the jumbo peg puzzles."
3,Poor quality paint!,"I have always been a fan of Melissa and Doug products, but I was dissappointed in this one. As other reviews mentioned, this product definitely had poor paint quality. As I took the plastic wrap off, the pain started to fall off. So, even before my 2 year old had a chance to get his hands on it, it was already chipping. If you are concerned about this, I would not suggest this product. I'm pretty dissappointed, but he seems to love it."
2,Klunky and limited.,"This software, while very affordable, is klunky and limited in what it provides. It will probably increase your reading speed, but only if you are pretty slow to begin with.Any slight deviation from the planned progression throws the program for a loop.To sum up: bad programming limites the utility of what might have been a valuable program."
2,Not a great buy,"I purchased this item in the hopes that I would be able to retain what I was reading at a faster pace. What bothers me the most is that the ""Training Tools"" appear in what is best described as a poorly designed website. Of the ""Training Tools"", only 3 (of 6) actually work - the rest are not ""clickable"" as the words over-ride the area to set the training parameters. I'm still in the middle of the actual course, but I'm second-guessing their ability to really assist me when they can't get simple procedures done . . . not a confidence builder. Could I return it and get a new one, yeah, maybe, but since my first order was screwed up by Amazon, I'm hesitant to repackage and do the whole thing again."
3,needs fixing,"so i try to use the practice sessions. i can load one file, as long as its not to long, and then after reading thru it i have to close the program and open it again to go on to the nextfile. the practice sessions also don't go all the way to the end of the file i'm reading. this is a simple simple and might i add simple software program. the programmer couldn't fix the pointer to start again or go on from where one file leaves off and another one starts. so simple that if i knew the language he uses i would get a dissembler and fix it myself. i'm thinking of just writing one myself."
2,WOW this is lousy software,"I can't imagine why this has gotten decent reviews -- I have a ton of issues with it.You can't upload new texts -- the 17,000 ebooks that it comes with CAN'T BE READ through the speed reading interface. And they load into a hideous ebook interface.You can't control the column width outside of changing the window size from small to large.You can't pause a quiz. That means if I get interrupted, I either have to ignore the interruption, or give up on the quiz. The latter might make sense IF YOU COULD DELETE A QUIZ SCORE. But the best you can do is delete ALL your scores, which is ridiculous.You can't tell a practice text where to start. If I get a quarter of the way through a book, then want to start again later, I have to start from the beginning.All in all, I would definitely choose something else."
5,"great for work, way better than the tea balls","I bought this because I was sick and tired of my tea balls opening and making tea soup. Sure you can buy a lot of tea balls for the price, but I hate waste so I figured I'd give this a try. I bought this for work and so far I've been very pleased. After you brew your tea, the infuser sits nicely in the lid keeping my desk nice and neat. If you're like me, you make a couple of cups from the same leaves (this is one of the many reasons loose tea is so nice). The design makes leaf reuse very neat and easy."
3,"Nice design, indifferently executed","I nearly didn't recogize this when it came out the shipping box.First, it is really small. That's ok, teacup size is well, appropriate. But the fit and finish was disappointing. It is stainless steel but probably not 18/10. The seam where the mesh was welded was rough and sloppy looking.Not a good value for $15 dollars and certainly not the $24 list. Not what I expected from Bodum."
3,I used to love this tea infuser...,"... but today it broke. I'd had it for just over a year. As the most expensive in-mug infuser on Amazon, it should be better constructed than that!It did fit in all my mugs, narrow and wide, and made tea brewing really easy. BUT-- I always cleaned it by holding the lip and banging it upside down against the side of the sink or compost bin till the wet tea leaves fell out. Today the basket separated from the rim, and I could see how very cheaply it was made. So, maybe I abused it. It's probably my fault. But I'm replacing it with the FORLIFE Extra-fine Tea Infuser and Porcelain Dish. It's impossible to tell from the photo if the lip is made from a separate piece, but at least it's cheaper and it's a different brand.If you buy this, don't clean it the way I did. Or at least don't expect it to last."
4,"I like it, but it's hard to clean.","It works very well, and I like using it.It is very shiny, and because of that it is hard to keep clean.Also, it is tough to rinse the leaves out from inside it.I do recommend it."
2,If you use big tea leaves...,I bought this for my husband based on the ratings and we were very disappointed. The tea baller we bought him till this one came was much better. He uses a tea that has smaller leaves which this infuser can't hold. If you use a tea with big leaves then this is for you.
1,Holes are TOO BIG,"Beautiful design and extended lip is easy to grip and cool to the touch. The holes are too big!! What were they thinking?!? I keep using it because I spent (what I consider) a relatively significant amount of money for this item, but I am continually disappointed each time I do use it...."
2,"Good design, bad impl","The strainer holes are too large with this infuser, the tea leaves remain in the cup. This is a serious problem with teas such as Assam, and some greens.I like the design, all stainless, but the holes need to be smaller."
3,Good for Certain Teas but Not Rooibos,"This is a great strainer which stays cool and is easy to use. However, the picture is somewhat misleading. The mesh is not as tight as the picture makes it seem. That's fine for a lot of teas out there, but with Rooibos you end up with lots of tiny pieces in your cup. Otherwise it does a good job."
2,ugly price sticker spoils experience,"Great idea - but before I used it for the first time, I had to use all sorts of scrapers and chemicals to remove the thick and heavy price sticker on the bottom. Not sure if I even got all glue off. Bad packaging - good product."
2,CONFUSING DESCRIPTION,"From the write up, I thought this product was 4"" deep. It is not. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me."
2,Yo Yo Tea Infuser,Thin and flimsy material. Product was dented and does not come with a lid as advertised in the picture. Would not buy this brand again.
4,"EXCELLENT TEA INFUSER, BUT...","I bought this one as a replacement, after the previous one (a slightly different design, also by BODUM) simply fall apart in 2 pieces, meaning the basket detached itself from the handle. Soldering does not solved the problem, so I hope that this one will last longer. Two months after purchase and using it on a daily basis, I am still happy."
3,best for whole leaf teas,"I wanted an infuser that would allow me to make a single mug of loose leaf tea at home. This item pretty much works as expected. But the holes in the side of the infuser are rather large--about 1mm. For whole leaf loose teas, that is not a problem. But for many other teas, it allows quite a bit of tea through.For example, when I make sencha or bancha green tea, I end up with a lot of sediment at the bottom of my mug. Also, rooibos tea is small enough to slip through the holes. And a few of the rooibos tea particles will actually get stuck in the holes, which becomes a slight hassle when cleaning the unit.I use this unit at home but at work I have a different tea maker which works better. It has a finer mesh screen so very little tea gets through. On Amazon, it is ASIN # B0000VLMQK, but is not currently available. However, the same item can be found at Teavana as ""2 cup perfect teamaker"" or at Adagio Teas as ""ingenuiTEA"", and sells for less than $20."
1,This item is only good for Large Leafed tea,"I bought some loose teas online and needed a infuser. I bought this one and the holes are too large for tea that is loose and cut up. When you add the water, the tea goes through the little holes and you are left with a cup full of tea pieces. I recommend any of the kind that looks like a coffee-mesh type filter. Kind of gold in color. I don't remember the name, but that is the kind I now use as thye work the best. Steel/aluminium, whatever it is, cannot work without a disposable filter."
3,OK as an anthology...,The sound mix is terrible and videos were never Moz's strong suit. Better to just rent it. The Boxers video is the only decent on there.
3,missing a couple vids,"It leaves out ""Our Frank"", ""Ouija Board"", ""Certain people I know"", ""Alma matters"" and the never-released (but known to exist) ""Hold Onto Your Friends"" video. The only new thing, is the never-before-shown 'Seasick' video. It also features ""Will Never Marry"" put over top of the stage-invasion montage from ""Introducing Morrissey""."
4,Not bad Sunny!,"A well thought out collection, although a few extras would not have harmed anyone. Includes much un-seen video 'Seasick...', which acompanys the song particularly well. Could only think of a couple of videos missing from this collection, though generally, a dvd worth owning."
4,"Works great, but could be a couple bucks cheaper.","Perfect amount of light for a bathroom. Doesn't protrude much from wall, and supplies an outlet. Good product."
4,"decent light, not perfect","The amount of light is adequate for stumbling to the toilet in the middle of the night. However, it isn't very bright unless your eyes are adjusted to the darkness. It is a bit pricey, particularly considering it doesn't perform too well as an outlet. It tends to fall out of the socket. The sensor seems to behave properly."
2,"Pretty dark and wide, may block outlets.","I bought this for our bathroom. The outlet is the non-traditional horizontal layout, so this nightlight was too wide. It ended up blocking the second outlet, which made it useless. It gave off a VERY dim yellow light. I thought the light was completely yellow and disgusting. I would prefer a white LED that doesn't look like it's 30 years old when lit up. I am returning this."
5,"Saves outlet, provides great little low-wattage night light",This is a great little device. Exactly what I was looking for as I wanted a night light but didn't want to lose the outlet's usage and this accomplishes that goal.
3,Not as bright as I thought,"We needed a night light that was bright enough to dimly light the living/dining area (only about 800 sq ft). Considering this was not a cheap light I thought it would do the job. Unfortunately, this is a rather weak light."
3,Wish it were Brighter,"I chose this nightlight because it didn't take up an extra plug in my bathroom, but I wish it were brighter. I still have a hard time seeing during the night. I do like that I can plug things in and don't have to mess with it. I would choose a brighter one next time and deal with taking it in and out."
3,My only gripe...,The light is not bright enough. It would be great if it was just a little brighter. I would compare it to a lit candle in terms of how bright it is or maybe dimmer. It lights up the immediate surrounding area just enough to make things out. Mine is in my bedroom and I have to put it in the outlet closest to my bed to be of any benefit. It does produce a nice amber glow which to me is more soothing. It's nice that it doesn't take up an outlet when plugged in. Also like the fact that it is an LED and hardly uses energy at all. It automatically comes on when it is dark and goes off when there is light. I think this light would be best suited for a smaller area such as a bathroom or maybe a narrow hallway but not in a bigger area such as the bedroom. Despite it not being bright enough I suppose it makes up for it with its other features. But in the end I think I will need to purchase a brighter night light.
1,What a mess,"First the sound quality is poor - I had my stereo turned almost up to max and it was just loud enuf to hear.Then there are the uncredited/unlisted ""bonus tracks"" - they are comercials/radio ads for Ike & Tina.The version of ""River Deep, Mountain High"" is not the Phil Spector version."
5,Ike and Tina rock!,"I was so pleasantly surprised to learn there was alot more to Tina Turner than ""whats love got to do with it"". This music really grabs you. Tina's vocal range is phenominal and no matter what problems Ike had in his personal life, he's a musical genius. I highly recommend this CD."
3,"not a bad twist, some inconsistencies","When i think of drow, i think of salvatore. Some inconsistencies in character development in this. However a good read.Hopefully more later ? :)"
3,Good deal,"The books you buy would cost much more by themselves,unless you catch them on sale somewhere local.So money wise if you like these books,this is a deal.Now I'll say this,the first two books are real page turners.Great reads and enjoyed every second.The last book however was just an epic failure.I will not spoil it for you,as some might like the last book.It was just not the kind of thing I enjoy whatsoever."
5,Fantastic journey from our unpleasant modern reality,"Trial Tribulations, plots in Plots, surprise this has them all and the writing style of Elain Cunningham once again tied me to this trilogy until I had finished it, which then prompted me to hunt for more of the same from this author, especially having read all of her earlier works. I hope there is more to come"
5,Love these pencils!,Purchased these large pencils initially for my 4 years old. I quickly fall in love with these pencils. The large size and shape of the pencil makes it very easy to hold and write especially for a person with carpal tunnel like myself. The product packaging and shipping were excellent and fast. Better and faster than I expected. Very happy with the purchase!
3,poor packaging...,"I didn't like the fact that the box was all ripped up and re-taped as if was sent back and re-sent back out...the pencil were coming all out the box. This is suppose to be a gift for someone and I don't feel comfortable given them this box like this.Dixon Ticonderoga ""My First Tri-Write"" Beginner Size 36-Count Pencils with Eraser (Wood-Cased Black Writing Pencils) (13082)"
5,Wonderful product,This pencil is a great product for kids that are starting to learn how to write. It fits in their hands perfectly and provides proper finger placement on the pencil.
5,ticonderoga -my first pencils,"These pencils are wonderful for children who are moving to a triangulated grip, the triangular sides make it easy for little fingers to position themselves in an efficient and comfortable position to make printing and drawing a more successful experience. It beats the triangle grips because whichever pencil you pick, you're set for a proper grip."
1,Too bulky for little hands,"I had hoped to find a pencil built more like the triangle grippers. This pencil is bulky and the ""edges"" are too rounded to really force the proper grip and provide the ergo comfort for my 6-year-old's hand to keep it relaxed enough for a worksheet's worth of writing. They came unsharpened, so I had to sharpen one to test it on her. I'll see if Amazon will accept it as a return because I don't want to be stuck with 36 of these. My advice is to start with a smaller quantity before you leap."
1,Not what I ordered,This is not what I got in the mail. I will be sending them back. I was expecting and wanting tri-write triangle pencils and I got regular round pencils. :(
1,Class action law suit due to defective light engines,"Hitachi has been aware for years of the defective light engine on this TV.Buying this tv will cost another $600 for Hitachi to send the improved light engine to a repair facility.Buy the Mitsubishi TV instead, they have great customer service.I got a brand new 60"" 3d for $200.00 after my 57"" went out, even though the warranty was expired by two years."
1,Look out,"Another Amazon description problem, this is not what you think it is! I realized when I received it that the description was not accurate and had spelling problems."
5,Go Ducks!,"Bought this for our Supervisor who is Major Ducks fan. Shipping took lnger than promised, but it is a quality shirt and very roomy. Fit perfect!"
3,Just ok,"Althought the price is decent, the plastic covering face does not fit snuggly over the mini and therefore it makes using your wheel on the ipod difficult sometimes esp. if you are in the gym"
1,whining from a dissapointed fan,"I have been a huge PSB fan my whole life. I have just about every CD, single, and video they have put out. I want to convince myself that this album is good, but its not. I am so dissapointed; this has to be the worst album they have released.Neil is trying to be some opera star on top of the pop. I just can't stand to listen to how bad his whining has gotten.I will be seeing them in concert next month and I am hoping that they don't sing too many songs from this CD. In fact, the only song worth listening to is the one with Elton John voiceovers: ""In Private"" which is on disc 2."
3,It's another (slightly different) PSB album,"It seems unreasonable to expect pop artists to continually innovate and ""improve"" their sound, let alone remain contemporary, but that's what fans want from acts like Pet Shop Boys. Their ""Imperial Phase"", as Neil Tennant called it, was nearly 20 years ago, and since then they've tried hard to at least remain consistently good. ""Fundamental"" benefits from Trevor Horn's production, but I don't find the album as interesting or affecting as ""Release"" - the newie has too many slow, undistinguished songs, and nothing that really pushes the boundaries of the PSB universe (like ""I Get Along"" or ""Boy Strange""); it's the first album of theirs I've heard only a couple of times before shelving. I've found PSB albums usually improve over time (even the tired ""Nightlife""), so here's hoping..."
4,PSB Do It Again.,A good album but not the best. This CD has it's songs. I just don't think this one will be in too many people's players a year from now like past PSB CD's. Still A must have It has it's momments.
2,"Like ""Release"", too many slow songs","I must confess I only sampled this album in a store; I listened to every track for at least a few minutes. My main question is: Neil, where are the melodies? The great choruses? It sounds as if they're trying to go in a Depeche Mode mode, mostly dreary, slow, and somber. I'm afraid nothing on it really grabbed me other than ""I'm With Stupid"", and even that more for the lyrics that the tune itself. I instantly loved past albums such as ""Behavior"", ""Very"", and ""Nightlife"", but my first impression of ""Fundamental""?; I'm underwhelmed. Disc two, with the remixes and such, is OK for your next rave party, but is the new version of Dusty Springfield's PSB production ""In Private"" really necessary? Even with its high-energy bounce, neither Neil Tennant nor Elton John makes one forget Dusty's incredible vocal on the original. It's still hers, boys."
3,fundamental: pet shop boys.,"there were some good songs and there were some not great songs.if you are a fan of the pet shop boys , then you will enjoy the cd.the bonus disk of remixes is the icing on the cake. enjoy the remix of ""i'm with stupid."""
3,The death of Synth-Pop,"I just got thru with listening to the new Pet Shop Boys CD and I am very disappointed by it. The cover art, as with all of their previous packaging is superb, but the overall execution of the music falls really short. Talk about a death knell. It's an uneven mess and downright dreary in some places. This is their first misstep in a long and illustrious career. The second disc of remixes and bonus tracks IS much better, however. What makes all of this even more sad is the fact that this album could very well be the last nail in Euro synth-pop`s coffin. I just wish there was a new genre of music that is fit to take its place, but there's not. Oh well, we still have Madonna...and maybe The Killers.Best tracks - Psychological, Integral, Fugitive and In Private."
1,Probably the worst PSB album.,"Sorry, but it is so. And i just thought ""Home and Dry"" was bad....Since the early 80âs PSB had a tradition: not more then 2 bad tracks on the CD.Unfortunately, there are only 2 mediocre tracks on the new album: âI'm With Stupidâ, and âLuna Parkâ. Everything else is just pathetic.Y."
4,best cd they've done in years...,"After the disappointing ""Release"" and the uneven ""Disco 3"", it is an absolute pleasure to see the Pet ShopBoys back in top form. I would have given five stars except for the 2 maudlin slow songs. When will the Boys learn that their ennui is best served with a good back beat? (""Rent"" anyone?) The import 2 cd set is well worth the money simply for the inclusion of the duet with Elton John on ""In Private""."
1,I want my money back!!!,The boys are finished. It is quite easily the worst album they have ever produced and I have not even heard the full CD at that. I just pulled it out of my CD player after the first few songs. In fact just one thing comes to my mind. What were they thinking when they put out this album??? There is not one track worth writing about. The remixes - well I will not waste any time on that. If the boys are clever then they will avoid a 'Fundamental' world tour otherwise they will lose whatever goodwill they have with their fans.YUCK!!! The party is officially over.
4,Pet Shop boys- Fundamental,"When I bought the newest PSB CD, Yes, I got the bonus CD version and was glad I did. The bonus track and remixes are excellent, but I wouldn't recommend paying the extra money to get the bonus CD version of Fundamental. The bonus tracks just arent that great. But the CD itself is very good and would defintely recommend it. Best track- Luna Park."
3,Fundamental,"I thought this c.d. was going to be similar to they're Very album.It didn't come close,but it's like they did a backwards flip to a early 70/80's.Now,needless to say the song that stood out to me was The Sodom and Gemorrah Show and I'm With Stupid.???Humm.What we're they thinking?I feel that this c.d. doesn't have the staying power to be on the charts and has any strong points.It was a nice try,but i feel Pet Shop Boys could have done alot better.If your a hard core P.S.B. fan you might like it."
4,The second pressing (release Oct 2002),"This new edition have fixed the sound problem, and the movie now have excellent sound through the whole movie. The picture quality is excellent the first hour, but the rest is still kinda blurry videoquality. The opening and end credits are still hard to read and the subtitles are still impossible to remove.This DVD still recives 4 stars because it may be the most personal war story I've ever seen. German and Norwegian troops are treated equally and followed closely in their struggle."
4,GOOD PIC OF UNUSUAL SUBJECT,1940 GERMAN INVASION OF NORWAY. RETIRED SEAMAN AND OVERAGE EX CAVALRY SECOND LIEUTENANT VOLUNTEERS FOR SERVICE. EXCELLENT STUDY OF COMMAND.GOOD ACTING. GOOD PLOT.
1,file corruptions frequently,"I'm using this with a 400gb Western Digital harddrive on Windows XP system. First, I had hard time formatting and partitioning the drive with this case using native Windows XP tools. I finally used some commercial software. I transferred a lot of files into the harddrive via this case but there are too many file corruptions. I almost lost my important data, fortunately I had backup in DVD. Between the famous and reliable harddrive and this made-in-china case, naturally I think it's this drive that responsible for the file corruptions."
1,utter crap,"Thing worked great for the first few days, then it kept dropping off of the bus.After looking at it the USB port on the back is just too big and loose. It wouldn't securely hold any cable (and I have lots of USB cables) I put in it.Along with that, after opening the case to put the SATA drive into another enclosure I could smell something had been burnt.I would say stay away as this thing will toast your drive, one way or the other. Kudos to Tiger Direct for being fast on the return and refund."
1,Not worth,"Though it has many features like, FM, Voice recorder, Video...etc. But doesn't have good battery backup. Battery charge comes down very quickly within 3-4 hrs."
1,I would NOT purchase this movie again,"I thought this movie was the worst in my collection.... I got through it but it will either be pitched or on the shelf. Bad for me, I thought the whole movie was sad, and not as i thought. I definately would not purchase it again."
3,Couldn't follow it,I too had a hard time following the dialogue. I have no idea what they were talking about half the time. This would be better to have subtitle option for those of us not living in England.
2,Wouldnt watch it again,"Lillies itself was we'll done and well cast. However, if you are a Jane Austin fan and lean more towards the beautiful period movies and series, you will be disappointed as this is very true of the harsher side of life in these times and is not an uplifting or beautiful series to watch. I wouldn't watch it again."
5,Irish not British,The Irish (which I am one of) see things differently from the English. This is a relatable drama about 3 sisters and the directions they take after the first world war. A lot to discover.
3,Not Closed-caption as shown in Amazon's Product Details,"I'm sure this is a great series, as reviewed by the majority, and we were eagerly looking forward to the same experience. However, the ""closed-captioned"" reference, as shown in Amazon's Product Details, is not available on the disks. Many of us are dependent on closed-captions, particularly in BBC series' where the dialog includes cockney and a host of other London dialects appropriate to that period. (Under these circumstances, it was difficult to assign a rating--I apologize for what may be a misleading 3-star rating.)"
4,Excellent acting- character driven,"The only thing I didn't like is the fact that there is no season 2. There were things left unfinished. Whatever happened to the scarred magician? Or Mr B's wife? Does Iris and you know who ever get together? We are left wondering. However you don't feel like you are left hanging much at the end as much is also resolved. A couple of episodes are a little slow, but for the most part you can't stop watching."
3,There is no ending,"Most of the reviews posted for this series are written either 2008 or 2007 so I'm sure many of the posters had expectations that the series would continue. Since it was not and there is little mention of that, it needs to be made known - the story doesn't end. The conclusion on the last disc leaves a lot of unanswered questions, essentially one for each member of the family. FYI, ****spoilers, sort of****, they are ALL still single at the end. They each have potential love interests, but none of them are resolved. We never know what happens, this isn't based on a book, its a series that wasn't brought back for a second season. Like Berkeley Square all you can do is wonder about those lost hours enjoying a story with no ending. I wish I had known this or I wouldn't have bothered watching something unfinished."
2,A near miss...,"Wouldn't you think that the manufacturers of a wine rack would measure the bottles of wine before designing the rack ?Apparently not, in this case. After purchasing 3 of these racks, I discovered that about 10% of my 200 bottle collection doesn't fit in the grid holes. It was understood that magnums weren't going to fit, which was no big deal. But when over 20 bottles end up sitting on the floor because they are about 1/8"" to 1/4"" too large in diameter I get a little irritated, especially after paying over $300 including shipping.The overall quality of the product is average. The racks were not straight along their length and had to be tie-wired together to keep them in alignment."
1,Cheaply made - not worth it,"Bought this from Wine Enthusiast for $99. I see someone else got it for $65 and even at that price it's no deal.The squares in the metal wire frames did not line up. So the ""back"" was off and caused the whole unit to be out of alignment.Also there are cheap brackets that bolt it to the wall, but they cause the unit to be so close to the wall the straighter bottles just lay flat with no tilt toward neck.Also, as someone else mentioned, there are many bottles that just dont fit.AND to add insult to injury - I emailed customer service at Wine Enthusiast... and no reply at all.!!It's tempting to buy this because of price as compared to other large capacity wine racks.. but dont do it .. waste of money.And be cautious with ""Wine Enthusiast"".Apparently they are not that ""Enthusiastic"" about helping out customers who they ripped off."
1,"overpriced, underperforming","I've had plenty of ear buds in my life, from $10 Sony's, to $100 dollar, well, Sony's, and they all sounded better than these. I got them for free, and I'm still disappointed. I can't believe they cost almost $150 dollars! Their sound is EXTREMELY dull, they have a base setting, that doesn't produce base. It doesn't matter what kind of music I listened to, it ruined it all. I gave them to my dog as a new play toy. They have ruined my life (that's not true, but they are terrible)."
2,Not Compatable with Iphone,Not a great productThe only reason I bought this cuz it said that it works with iphone thats not true.Clarity wise I will not suggest.Earbuds are weird.
5,Alphabet soup deliciousness,"I will start off by saying I have yet to purchase this on amazon but I have purchased this at health food stores. So I can not say how it will arrive to you but i cant tell you about the taste.Amy's organic has consistently done a great job of creating delicious vegan/vegetarian organic food. This soup has a very similar taste to certain canned pasta product. It totally brought me back to my childhood. It is extremely delicious, low in fat and calories. It is a quick and healthy alternative to the old stand-bys we are used to. Whether to give your child a better lunch or a trip down memory lane for yourself please give this soup a chance."
3,Amy's Alphabet Soup,"Although I loved the ease and price of making this purchase online, when it arrived over half of the cans were very severely dented. A few so much so that it was almost impossible to order them.I definitely have to reconsider where I purchase this in the future."
3,It's perfect if you want just a very small aspect of Steve Vai.,"However, my review has to be negative in that I think that there are so many other sides to Steve Vai that should be given a look. I actually put together my own copy of the album from downloading a few tracks off of iTunes, and adding the other tunes as well from their original albums, including the hidden track.When looking at this album, it does have enchanting guitar melodies, but some of his best track number sevens were done after this album was made (""Whispering a Prayer,"" ""Brandos Costumes (Gentle Ways),"" and ""Lotus Feet""). I would recommend Alien Love Secrets to start out, but my personal favorite is Alive in an Ultra World, which I wrote an extremely long and detailed review on."
3,"a reviewer from canton,ma.","they should have called this cd the flavor of vai.this cd is a good sampler of first time listeners to steve vai of his various styles of music,but for long time listeners it's still a bit much,to pay for a whole cd to hear 2 new songs."
4,Okay Compilation CD...Plus 3 new Tracks!,"Now I've got a handy-dandy CD of all Vai's most sentimental and spiritual songs! For those unfamiliar with the guitar wizardry of Vai, I suggest this one to start.Hearing the songs again is definitely refreshing.""Melissa's Garden"" demonstrates Vai's maturing compositions. Not so shred-heavy to satisfy shred-heads, but very sentimental indeed.Overall a good buy."
5,The 7th Song: a Review,"Who else but Vai would think up such a concept, a collection of the 7th song off each of his albums. More interesting is the fact that it just so happens that every 7th song is a soft, melodic song. Talk about great planning or great coincidence. Either way it works.Also we are treated to 3 new songs and we are also treated to Vai's rendition of Christmas Time is Here, which is incidentally the 7th song on ""A Merry Axe-mas"" a collection of guitar greats playing Christmas Carols."
4,Good book with captivating story line.,"The book was easy to read and held my attention from beginning to end. I didn't want to put it down!! It also has helpful questions at the end of each chapter to test your understanding of the content. The illustrations are quite a bit out-dated, considering the book was written in the 70's, but the story line is still good. It's written for people at an intermediate level of Spanish, so don't expect a Dean Koontz or Michael Crichton type thriller, but it is definitely interesting and also teaches a lot about the Mexican culture along the way."
4,Well worth it,"I have been using the Hair, Skin, & Nail Support for some time now and have nothing but good things to say about it. My hair grows fast and thick, my nails have gotten thicker and my complexion has cleared up. I really recommend this product."
1,This DVD is a piece of junk,"I bought this DVD in November and used it for about 4 months. In March, it started giving problems. It freezes while trying to play any DVD or VCD while the same DVD/VCD works fine in another player. I plan to throw this player and DON'T RECOMMEND this to anyone who wants to buy it. You will only get about 3-4 months to get you out of the warranty period. Warranty is valid for 3 months labor and upto 1 year with a $20 service fee (I bought this for $20)!!"
1,Worst Electronic Purchase Ever,"These have got to be the worst electronics I've ever purchased. I bought two of these and they both have the same problems - really really flaky menu support. If you hit the menu button, sometimes it goes to the menu, and sometimes it just sits there grinding the disc and stops.Get into a menu and hit enter to choose an item, sometimes it just comes right back to the same place. Hit again and it may or may not work. Hit a third time and it may finally work if it feels like it.The menuing support is clearly extremely problematic and flaky."
4,Multi Region DVD Player,Bought Family Guy seasons from Australia and couldn't find a DVD player that would play them. This one did the trick! Couldn't be happier. It's simple and easy to use.
3,"Good, but not Region Free","I like it. It's small, easy to use, and works well. I bought it to watch my region 2 DVD's from the UK. However, it wasn't able to read them. It displayed, ""Wrong Region"" on the screen, when I placed them into the player. All in all, I'm keeping it to use it as a standard DVD player."
3,OK,"I bought my first one last December and it was great for 6 or 7 months. Then it stopped working suddenly and couldn't be fixed, so I ordered another one since they're cheap. That one didn't work at all and the company I ordered it from was fairly unhelpful. So now I'll try another one (from a different seller!) and hopefully this one will work for a while. For the money, my first one worked very well.... until it didn't. I had no problems with it reading any disk I put in and it was very user friendly. We'll see!"
2,cheap player that won't last,"I have one of these players. It worked for a few months then started crapping out. CyberHome is out of business, having been busted for the FBI in mid-2006 for making DVD players without paying royalties to the patent owners.It did work and accepted the region-free hack. But it is not a long-term solution for your region-free DVD needs."
1,Not ALL REGIONS,"I bought this DVD player so I could play DVDs that we get from family overseas. When we tried to play them, they would not work. I contacted the seller to see what was wrong and they sent an email saying they would help me but they never came through on their promise. I still have not heard back from them."
1,Little Pile Of Junk,"I purchased this player as a gift for my elderly parents because it was small, inexpensive and looked easy to use. Unfortunately, it has never played a DVD all the way to the end without some sort of problem. It either stops tracking about halfway through playback, or it won't get past the main menu. You can hear it spinning and spinning as it tries to track, but ultimately it simply stops and has to be unplugged to get the disc out. It's the same with any type of disc. I've seen this particular model under different brand names as well, so I believe it's some sort of generic item that any company can buy and slap their name on. This little player is one big disappointment."
1,What a rip off.,"This product region free zone free all region, but it read a PAL as wrong region. It behaves as a normal region 1 DVD player"
2,You can skip this one,You get what you pay for. I was upset that my player did not work with component cables. Works decently with the regular cable and does play multi region DVD's. You are better off investing in a nicer player.
2,CyberHomes DVD,"Buyers should note that CyberHomes DVD was raided by the FBI in June of this year where they confiscated over 20,000 units. CyberHomes is not a licensed manufacturer and had used technical patented data of Phillips to produce inexpensive units. They were charged with violating patent laws. Their units have been sold in most electronic stores across the United States."
1,NOT RELIABLE AND NOT A PROPER MULTI-REGION!!,"Sometimes it plays region 2 DVD's, sometimes it doesn't. Its so unreliable, a lot of the times we watch DVD's on it, it locks up or jumps ahead a scene or two. Its terrible. I would have sent it back, but the shipping to ship a small but heavy DVD player would cost as much as the unit itself. It's not actually a proper region free or multi-region DVD player as advertised, it states region 1 clearly on the back of the unit and it just came with typed instructions on how to enter a code to make it play other region players. Even if your looking for a bargain, take time to look around, Circuit City, Walmart, Target and even OSH regularly have DVD players for 20-40 dollars too so just go there, and that way if you have any problems it costs you nothing but your time to return it!!"
1,Cyberhome = Garbage,Anything Cyberhome manufactures is garbage. The products are lucky to last six months. Don't bother emailing Support as they don't respond.
4,Universal DVD Player,Compact and simple. Worked perfectly with a borrowed German DVD with European Region Code.
3,multi-region and cheap,"I bought one of these 3 years ago at the supermarket for less than $50. It was my first DVD player. I later learned that with a simple code entered into the remote, you could make it region free. (most of them come that way now. Mine didn't) I'm not going to tell you this is the greatest player in the world, it isn't by far. I will say that if you are looking for a cost effective way to play DVDs from out of your region, or you just want a cheap player for the kids room, this is fine. If it dies, or the kids screw it up, you are out $30. It's a no-brainer."
1,Horrible Product,"I ordered one of these machines and it didn't work properly. It would skip and reject disks. I ordered a replacement and it didn't work at all. I would not recommend buying this brand at all. Not only has the company gone bankrupt, but the warranty information is several years old. It is not worth your trouble. I recommend spending more money for a product that works."
3,Works fine for less than a year,"As with some other reviewers, mine worked great playing region-free for less than a year, then stopped recognizing any discs -- DVDs or CDs. If you can find it for $25, it's a buy. But in any case, plan that it's disposable."
1,Poor machine,"Very choppy video playing - sort of a freeze frame effect, especially on panned shots. Also background sound cuts in and out. Freezes the video frequently. I plan to return it."
4,Great little item for the price you pay,"We got two of these little DVD players for over 3 Yrs nowand they do a pretty fine job. They played approx. 98% ofthe DVD's that we tried to play on them, so far no complaint,works fine for us. We play US and European DVD's on these players."
1,False Advertising!,"This DVD Player is NOT Region Free. I tried everything that the other reviewer had said that should supposedly unlock the thing but it didn't work. I tried at least 20 times. I wonder if he got paid to leave that review?! Then when I tried calling the 800 number (actually 888) I was connected to a hoax Bahama's cruise line. When I called again the next day I got transferred to a 411 phone line which cost me $$ !!!! Unbelievable! Last but not least, the dvd player arrived in patched, beat up box. Off to return it now. I just hope I get my money back."
5,Great pencil!,A great pencil like this Cross pencil is worth a thousand words or a thousand crossword puzzles. This is the 3rd one I've purchased and given as gifts over the years. Keep making this classic!
1,Cross doublecrosses,"The A. T. Cross company has pulled a switcheroo. Without telling anyone, they have dropped the .5mm lead pencil and are substituting the .7mm pencil under the same model number. That's why I returned my pencil for credit. Amazon should remove the item from sale."
1,cross pens from s,"although the seller willer will refund the sale price, purchase of cross pens from a seller can be a wild ride. jg"
5,Simple luxury,"I gave this as a Christmas gift but before I wrapped it, I just had to try it on. I had to force myself to take it off and wrap it. Beautiful black soft cashmere goes with anything from a suit to a sweater. I hope to purchase one for myself when the weather turns colder."
4,a review,"it was a great book about a little girl and her old friend captin bill. Who says there there arent good mermaids? in this exiting tale trot (the little girl) and captin bill see what a mermaids life is about and run into a ""little"" trouble alog the way. this book is a great tale for all ages and should be read by you!!!!"
5,A WONDERFUL book!,"This was a great book! I love the Oz books, and this was just as good, if not better than some. It is about a girl named Trot and her wise old friend Cap'n Bill, a sailor who lost his leg and has lived with Trot's family ever since. They go deep into the ocean to see a beautiful mermaids palace, meet the sweet and lovely mermaids, and explore the ocean. One of Baum's best books, the descriptions are fabulous and humorous. Then the mermaids and their comrades ghet captured by the evil wizard, Zog, and they have to fight to stay alive, outwitting Zog's clever plans. I have always been fascinated with mermaids, and I have never been able to find a great book that really got into the lives of mermaids until now. GET THIS BOOK! END"
3,Borderland of Oz book introduces Trot and Cap'n Bill,"The Sea Fairies is an important book in the works of L. Frank Baum. It marks his first major fantasy after he tried to give up writing the more famous Oz books. In style and tone it is much like the Oz books, and introduces the characters Trot and Cap'n Bill who Baum later brought into his series of Oz books. The villain, Zog, in The Sea Fairies is one of Baum's most fascinatingly evil characters, and the suspense as Zog tries to Destroy Trot, Cap'n Bill, and their mermaid friends is high. The first half of the book is loaded with an exploration of the fantastic undersea world as only Baum could tell it, full of his wonderful flights of fancy and loaded with puns, as readers of his Oz books are familiar with."
5,What a delight that this treasure is being published again!,"I too was thrilled to discover that the Magical Land of Noom has been republished. I was searching rare book sites hoping to find a copy, and lo and behold discovered the listing at Amazon.com. I've ordered three copies, two as surprise gifts for siblings. I cannot wait to see the illustrations of the Soft-Voiced Cow and other characters again. I will probably purchase another to donate to our public library, as today's children should have the chance to discover this gem."
3,Unlocking Census With GIS,A useful books for demographers who desire to understand how GIS can be applied to census data. A suitable student reference since it combines demographic know-how with GIS technology in an attempt to give the user exposure to both worlds.
5,GREAT WORKOUT,I LOVE RICHARD HE IS SOO FUN TO WORKOUT WITH.I HATE WORKING OUT SO SINCE I AM FAT I HAVE 80PDS TO LOSE.SO IF I HAVE TO WORK OUT IT IS GUNA BE WITH RICHARD AT LEAST I CAN LAUGH WITH HIM WHILE IM SUFFERING LOL.GREAT DVD LOOKS OLD BUT IT IS GOOD FOR ALL YOU NEED TO SWEAT.AND EVEN BETTER YOUR SWEATING WITH RICHARD SIMMONS.SO GO SWEAT AND LAUGH YOUR FAT OFF.LOL
5,Sweatin' & Lovin' it!,"Richard has done it again! I purchased Sweatin to the Oldies about 20 years ago to help shed the weight I gained from having 5 children. Now that I'm a little older, I'm finding I need to lose a few pounds. I've tried all the new fancy products, gadgets, and diets, and couldn't even lose a pound. After 1 week of diet and Sweatin' to the Oldie's 5 I have already lost 3 pounds! What I love most is the fun. I actually enjoy going home and dancing to the music. There is just something about it that makes getting fit fun!"
2,Not the same,"Doesn't have the same fun ""atmosphere"" as previous Sweatin' to the Oldies workouts. You can definitely tell that it was made after the other ones became so popular."
3,Disappointing,"It's hard to watch, with his leg problem. Didn't like the songs as well as Oldies 2. I shouldn't be effected by his leg, but it is right there in front to elicit empathy."
1,Disco Beat Overwhelming,"Although I found Richard's first two workouts to be fun and enjoyed the music, I got a migraine from the booming, disco beat that overwhelmed Richards voice on this dvd. If I turned my dvd player down, I couldn't hear directions."
2,disappointed,"I was looking forward to this dvd but was so disappointed when it came. I'm thinking the rave reviews are from people familiar with Simmons' routines. There is no preparation for a change in step and each step is done for such a short period of time that I'm 3 behind before the program has run a full minute! The music is grand - makes you want to move & dance - but if you get lost before things are really started, there's no point. In this program, the split second Simmons starts to say what we are going to do, he and everyone is doing it. By the time he stops explaining, he's right into another move!!! What tha . . .I'll stick to Leslie Sansone. Each new move lasts long enough for even a newbie to get it down before it changes. And before she starts a new move/step, she has explained what we'll do in the next step."
5,A MUST FOR ANY DRUMMERS LIBRARY!,"This is a must DVD for any serious drummer. The best drummers in the world, playig with one of the best Big Bands in the world! It does not get any bettr then this folks, this is it right here!"
3,"Good book, but needs to be updated with most current info","Very useful guide to wading through all the personal, medical and social issues one encounters when faced with this disease."
1,Misleading Western Medicine Biased View,"This book has overlooked the role of alternative therapies such as acupuncture and herbology in the treatment of Hepatitis C. Additionally, they do not even mention the wonder herb, milk thistle. They only put negative connotations to anything that isn't good-old-US approved. The chapters on emotional and nutritional care are far from complete as they lack depth and advocate only a small fraction of what is available to those who suffer. Don't waste your money on this one!"
5,A must read for anyone suffering from this disease.,"This book more then anything else has helped me to accept and deal with the disease of Hepatitis C. It helps explain the tests that the doctors use, and to understand their terminology to better understand what the different levels that they measure are and what they mean. Also it has helped me to live with this diseas rather than feel that I am dieing of this malady. A great help to all people who are affected by this disease or who know someone who is."
1,Not Good,I love Neil Diamond but this album left me very unhappy. I think I found one song that I enjoyed. I don't recommend it at all.
1,Not the Neil we love,"I bought this as soon as it was out. We have been fans a long time. We were very dissapointed with this CD. He sounds old and tired. No punch. Very little orchestra background. More like a singer in a coffee house at 2 AM than a performer in a concert. My wife said list it on ebay and say ""Played only once""."
1,Disappointing,"As I am listening to this CD, I keep waiting for Neil to break out into a rockin' song, but that just doesn't happen. And, heaven forbid, he should have to vocally sustain a note longer than 2 seconds. The lyrics are a huge disappointment and it is hard to believe someone with this much life experience couldn't come up with lyrics with more substance and depth."
5,I love this CD!,"The first time I listened to ""12 Songs"", I liked several of the selections but wasn't sure the others were that great. It took me just one more time to listen to the lyrics and the music before I realized how much I enjoy this CD. I find myself singing these songs during the day and I haven't gotten to the point of getting tired of them. This is a wonderful group of songs Neil Diamond has written. I recommend ""12 Songs"" highly! Oh Mary is my favorite selection."
4,Neil Diamond Redux,It is a pleasure for me to hear Neil Diamond's voice again after so many years. 12 Songs is a fine album.
4,Another hit for diamond,Neil Diamond is back without Sweet Caroline or any of the songs we have heard forever. This album is fresh and rich and wonderful. Highly recommended
5,Neil's Acoustical...and Great!,"I think this is one of his best! Just him, his guitar, and his newly penned songs. Beautifully produced! I got it for my wife, whose a big Neil Diamond fan, and she just listens to it over and over again. I even put two of my favorite songs from the album on my very selective MP3 Player (Tapwave Zodiac2), ""Delirious Love"" and ""What's it Gonna be."" This is a definite buy for any Neil Diamond fan."
2,Not for me,"I purchased this CD after seeing Neil Diamond in concert at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles in August this year. I was looking forward to listening to it while driving, but was sooooo disappointed!!It's not that Neil Diamond doesn't SING the songs well...as all of you know, he always has been and always will be a great singer! But with this CD, I didn't like ANY of the songs and found them too slow....too depressing. At least that's the way it felt to me (unfortunately)."
3,admirable but not breathtaking,A lot that's great and a lot to admire but too much is the same and at times really ponderous. But the voice continues to be one of a kind and the sentiments seem truly heartfelt and sincere.
4,What a fun time,"This is a really fun video - the Sharpe genre is very entertaining and gives an intersting insight into a soldier's life during the Napoleonic era and beyond. This adventure, set in India at the time of the East India company, is like an old fashioned romp. The bad guys are really bad (lucious Toby Stephens!) and the good guys are great (salt of the earth Sean Bean). The main story is wonderfully set in a fortress in India; the scenery in majestic. The short about the making of the movie and the outtakes complement the movie wonderfully. Highly recommended for a cozy evening in front of the television!"
3,A challenge,"I obtained the USA release of this Sharpe film in the hope that it did not contain the same annoying feature as the UK release. Namely without warning ""next time"" appears on screen, giving a brief rundown on what we are about to watch in the second half, something that has never happened in the previous Sharpe adventures on DVD. I ordered from the US thinking that the BBC & American distributors would not have allowed this to happen with this release. Incidentally I had written to the UK producers of this DVD twice without getting any reply.Having said all this, this is another great adventure with Sean and Daragh giving their usual superb performances as the two leads. The villians are great, the only regret is that this is condensed from three of Bernard Cornwall's books, which reduces the chance of seeing Sharpe on screen. I can only hope that Sean & co. will make other appearances in Sharpe's adventures."
4,Is that all there is...,"An interesting add-on to the original 14 Sharpes. Bernard Cornwell's books go on and on but the series seemed wrapped-up at ""Sharpe's Waterloo"". This is a nicely-done (more-or-less) costume drama in the Sharpe's milieu. Either Britain's Channel 4 was hoping for a new series or Sean Bean needed some fast cash. Either way, it was a decent hour plus."
5,Return to the adventures of Richard Sharpe,"I highly reccommend this for any fan of the original 14 episode series, this was an eagerly awaited and long overdue return of Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean). While this movie is taken out of timeline context with the original series of books by Bernard Cornwell, it is a worthy addition to the original BBC series. Sean Bean reprises his role as Richard Sharpe, ten years later, and is as wonderful as ever. Because lets face it, no one could do it better. If you are a fan, you'll be left wanting more and more. But I fear this is the final chapter in the episodic enterprise for the BBC. But take heart, Bernard Cornwell continues to churn out ever more adventures of our beloved Richard Sharpe, and I for one will continue to enjoy Sharpe for as long as he cares to write about him."
3,Sharpe's Challenge,"It is okay. It lacked a sense of adventure. Perhaps the actors are tired of the parts but somehow it just wasn't all that good. The fight scenes just didn't seem convincing.As a fan of the Sharpe books and past videos (I have them all), I wish I had seen it on TV because I probably would not have purchased it.The added features are interesting. The making of the video in particular. But, if you are a fan, you should purchase it for your collection. It is not all that bad just not that good."
2,Sharpe's Challenge,"It was good to see Sean Bean revive his role as Richard Sharpe, but I am not sure if it was aging, or him not fighting in Europe or visualizing him in ""Lord of the Rings"" but it seems as those he has lost his charisma as a British soldier in the Napoleonic era."
1,Incomplete production,"Only first half or less of a story, ending in a cliff hanger and trailers for additional episodes not produced, not even listed in IMDB much less included on the dvd -- or any other dvd. Looks like a BBC mix up. Not useful without the rest of the revived series, which doesn't seem to have been made."
3,too many unnesessary violent scenes do not make a film realistic !,"The actors are excellent ,I like the story,the locations but did not like the too violent scenes:people beheaded,tortures...unnecessary ,it does not add anything to the story it only makes me NOT wanting to watch it again !!!I wish I could return it ! Keep it only because of TOBY STEPHENS !"
2,Sharpe's Challenge Disappointing,I enjoyed the Sharpe series on Masterpiece Theatre years ago and was looking forward to watching Sharpe's Challenge on PBS but quickly I was painfully aware of the gratuitous violence in this latest episode. The earlier Sharpe episodes had plenty of violence but not nearly as graphic as this one. I think it is much too sad that we are fed this type of over-the-top violence in what could be thrilling mysteries and adventure stories. There were such horrid scenes that came up so fast that I didn't have time to look away. I wouldn't want my children to see something like this. I felt strongly enough about it that I had to write my review.
5,More Sharpe's aventures,"What do you expect, wel it is in here again. Sharpe's at it again and lots of action."
3,The Fugitive at Greyledge,"This book has alot of promise and I think that Jack Schultz may do much better in the future. The story line was very good and the characters were very believable, but most of the obscenities were totally unnecessary and very unbelievable that southern women talked like that in the 1950s. Women didn't talk like that in Newark NJ in the 1950s! Take out the raw sex and add a little romance and you would have a pretty good book."
2,I didn't really like it,"This book wasn't so great for me. It's about this over-weight woman living in great britain. she struggles with her ""condition"", which always has her going from diet to binge, diet to binge. until one day,this scientist is testing over weight women on diet pills on a one-year trial. she goes for it, un aware that she isn't acutally taking the real pills. you might like it. but i didn't."
4,Start your writing Career.,"As a novice scriptwriter 'the art of plotting' gave me hope. It made me understand that there are time tested techniques and formulas to follow to make your script stand out. It also made me realize that script writing is no easy task however with a couple of tips and tricks from Cowgill, one can easily add emotion, suspense and depth to our work.I recommend reading a screenplay writing book before reading this as there are several references to screenplay writing techniques that you should already be familiar with. A good one to pickup is Secrets of Screenplay Structure and Writing Short Films, Cowgill's other book, which is used in writing programs across the country.The art of plotting is well written and concise. Ofcourse the author is a leader in her field. She teaches at the Los Angeles Film School and Loyola Marymount University. Cowgill gives us a good glimpse into what it takes to write something that a lot of people can appreciate. I definitely recommend it."
5,One of the best cartoons I've ever seen,"I have wanted to have Louie on DVD for some time. My kids and I watched this show every week before it was cancelled. We even taped a number of the episodes and the kids still love watching them. One thing I would suggest is that more than one episode per DVD. I have seen Lake Winnibigoshish and it's a riot. I loved every episode and can't wait till they come out, I will buy them all, and please Louie, do extra stuff, I would love to hear from you on more of this, and go back on TV I really miss this show!"
5,God's Minutes,"This devotional book challenges the reader to become a better person. The stories are interesting, concise, and full of practical lessons. My family uses these devotionals for worship time, especially when we have guests in our home. Almost every time, our guests ask where they can obtain this book. The devotional thoughts only take about three to five minutes to read, yet our guests end up talking about the subject matter for much longer, so it is a great conversational starter tool. I would recommend the book to anyone, especially to people who want to learn about God, to be a better person, and to witness to others. It would be a great book to put in a waiting room at a place of business such as a doctor's office or on the coffee table in your living room for sharing."
2,"Sorry, just didn't do it for me","The subject matter of this film intrigued me along with it being an independent movie. However, there wasn't much about it that I liked. The acting was atrocious, the constant use of flashbacks and apparitions were annoying, and the ""plot"" bordered on the ridiculous. This is what happens I guess when young film students who think that Kevin Smith is a genius start making their own movies. Blecch!"
3,"NICE, BUT!",TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS W/UNIT ONE DOES A POOR JOB OF REFLECTING ACTUAL OUTSIDE WEATHER CONDITIONS.ANNOYING ALARM THAT GOES OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.ALARM DESIGNED TO WARN YOU WHEN OUT SIDE TEMPERTURES REACH OWNERS INPUTED HIGH/LOW TEMPURTURE.OURS NEVER REACHED THE INPUTED LEVELS TO TRIGGER ALARM! NONE THE LESS THE ALARM WOULD GO OFF! NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DIS-ABLE ALARM SETTING. TOOK BATTERIES OUT UNTIL I HAVE TIME TO CONTACT MANUFACTURER.
4,Looks good,"The frame is decently made and well finished. My wife thinks it's a bit ornate, but I'm happy with it."
3,MORE DESCRIPTION INFO NEEDED,"THE FRAME IS OK, BUT ONLY A SEPERATE STAPLE IS INCLUDED, (TO BE ATTACHED BY PURCHASER), FOR HANGING. NO STRUT IS ATTACHED OR INCLUDED FOR STANDING THE FRAME ON A FLAT SURFACE. I FEEL THE DESCRIPTION SHOULD SAY WHAT HANGING, OR STANDING, HARDWARE IS INCLUDED,JED"
5,11x14 picture frame,"Outstanding quality frame at a great price. Everything is included. In 5 minutes my picture was ready for hanging.The seller was great, they had the frames packed extremely well.The frames came faster than I expected. I will order from them again.Highly recommended!"
4,Slam Dunk,"Got these as gifts for the grand-in-laws, and they loved them. I shipped them to my mother-in-law's, so I did not ever see the frame myself; which is why I rated this a 4 star and not a 5 star."
3,THE MAN THAT STARED AT A GOAT,This is one of the books the men who stare at goats is based off of. If you liked that movie or have any interest in remote veiwing this is a good book.
4,Random pickup at the library,Run through the library and pick up a random book from a section you are at all even remotely interested in. You might choose this book - I did.Lyn shares his experiences with the military and with CRV. Most parts of this book were fun to read. CRV is presented in a romantic light and I can see people being turned on to mental powers by the stories. My favorite was Buchanan putting his head into a particle beam weapon ray. How exciting!
1,What a Crock,"Lyn Buchanan was a ""psychic spy"" for the US Government in a program called ""Star Gate"". The government blew 20M dollars on these New Age b.s. artists with such great results that eventually the program was shut down. Buchanan attacks the magician and debunker, James Randi, but offers no hard proof that CVR works. It's absolute garbage."
3,too narrow toe area,"The shoe is a beautiful shoe, true to sizing. However, the toe was too narrow. I tried to pass it on to others who wear the same size. They too, had difficulty with the toe area. I have returned the shoe and am waiting for my refund."
4,Great story that left me wondering,"""The Walking"" was my first introduction into Bently Little's work. I have been searching for a good horror novel for some time and was seeking a new author who can spook me. ""The Walking"" provided a great story about dead people who continued walking. As a sort of shadow story we travel back in time to the wild west and are introduced to a town of witches. The story was fast paced, gripping and a good read. Unfortunatly, the story just ended. I was disapointed with the last 50 pages. It reminded me a too many modern horror movies that were pretty good until the had to end it and did so without much though. If Mr. Little could have reworked the ending a little, I believe this would have made a fantastic story and thus it gets only 4 stars as it went a full 80% but left the final 20% somwhere else."
2,Hardly the horror event of the year -- very average,"This is the first book I have read by this author and was sorely disappointed. After reading all the other reviews, however, it appears that this was probably not the author's best effort. Usually, I can easily lose myself in a good, creepy read, but I found that I just could not suspend disbelief enough to get into it. I didn't think the characters were developed that well, there were a couple red herring plot lines (what was the purpose of introducing the 'X-files type' FBI agent?) and everything came together too neatly and conveniently in the end. This would be a good story to relay over a campfire, but I couldn't recommend this book to the serious, critical reader."
2,Walking Away Dissapointed,"I had great hopes for this book, although i knew the dead would start ""walking"" i realized that they were not the Romero Zombies, or the Living dead of the zombie genre of today. Still i thought the idea of Dead people just pacing around doing nothing was still very creepy. The plot started out strong, the story within the story was pretty good, but when it came down to it the great evil running the show was pretty cheesy and quite frankly the way they deal with it was anticlimatic and elementary. I was more afraid of grandpa walking at the bottom of the lake then what made grandpa start walking in the first place."
4,Couldn't put it down .....,"From the very first chapter you're hooked. I couldn't put this book down! This is the first of Bentley Little's writing's i've ever read and I intend to treat his books as I do my collection of Stephen King novels, priceless pieces to read over and over again . His writing style keeps you riveted from cover to cover. I will definately continue to read more of everything from this author."
3,"""The Walking"" goes nowhere.","This is the first Bentley Little book that I've purchased, and while it's intrigued me enough to chance another one, The Walking in and of itself was a bit disappointing.It begins with a unique spin on an old 'walking dead' premise, and it's first half does a good job of building up the characterization and plot threads. Then, beginning in the early second half, the book begins to fall in upon itself. What was genuinely chilling in the opening half becomes rather silly by the second. The finale of the book is perhaps one of the worst, and least compelling conclusions I've read in this genre since Stephen King's ""Bag of Bones"".Overall, a passable read, but probably not the best introduction to Little's works."
2,P.S.--,"One more thing (sorry to have left this out), I would like to resoundingly agree with an earlier reviewer, for their remarks about the book's muddled anti-Christian sentiment. It was shallow at best, ignorant at worst. And yet he has his lead character joyfully celebrating Christmas... bizarre. Heck, in the first seventy pages, the author manages to demonstrate an astounding lack of research and understanding on the issues of Christianity, Halloween, and even witchcraft. The book was an offensive mess, philosophically.Thank you, and good night. :)"
3,I've Read Better,"I've read several of Bentley Little's books, and this one definitely wasn't one of his best. The dead get back up, walk around their (former) homes for a while, then head out on a journey. Everyone's trying to figure out why this is going on, and where the dead are going. When you finally find out why it's happening, the story does get a bit more interesting. Unfortunately, until you get there, it's kind of slow-going."
3,Not very compelling,"I picked up 'The Walking' based on the reviews on the cover, and it seems I'm in the minority. I just didn't find this book compelling. Its a great premise, and I kept waiting hopefully to get sucked in by it, but it never happened.I think that the primary job of any author of horror or fantasy fiction is to make you really care about their characters, to make their characters three dimensional and real. If the characters seem real, then the scary or fantastic elements seem real as well. Unfortunately Mr. Little never quite made me care about his characters like Stephen King, Peter Straub or Dean Koontz can. So I ended up doing a lot of skimming just to see where the plot went.The plot was unlike anything I have ever read, so I will probably give Mr. Little another chance. He just never brought me fully into the world he created, and since he couldn't do that he couldn't scare me. And isn't that what we all read horror for?"
1,Total Garbage,"One of Bentley's best ideas...and sadly it comes out in the worst possible fashion. The idea for the story is great and it promised to be an outstanding read, but unfortunately, Bentley wastes all of it's potential by supplying it with bland, uninspiring characters that seem as if they were conceived by a 8 year old. The characters thusly come across as completely unbelievable and ridiculous, and as a result you won't care whether they live or die - all you hope for is that they die in an extremely graphic way, and of course Bentley supplies that better than almost anybody else in the business.The conclusion is so utterly laughable you'll find yourself wondering why you even bothered reading the last 50 pages or so, and the ""supernatural terror"" controlling the whole situationc comes across as more of a ""supernatural joke"". Anti-climatic, boring and poorly thought out. Unless you're reading specifically for the gore element, you'll be sadly disappointed."
4,Three-and-a-half stars for this witchcraft novel,"The back of this book is irritatingly misleading-- this is *not* a zombie book-- the walking dead are a small aspect of the novel which has more to do with witchcraft and revenge than with zombies of any stripe.Think Eric Nylund crossed with Steven King and you'll get Bentley Little. Definitely more readable than the rest of the horror scribes.What's my beef with the book? Too slight-- the story should either be more dislocated (a la Tim Powers) or more epic (a la King). It achieves neither and ends up a little too forgettable.Still, better than most of what you'll find."
3,Not one of his best,"""The Summoning"" knocked my socks off, but this one is a bit of a letdown and not one of his best. For pure zombie fun I'm looking forward the Brian Keene's ""The Rising"" and loved ""Night of the Beast"" by Harry Shannon (althoug the danged zoms dont show until the last 100 pages, everything else does!) so although this is worth a read it is not one of BL's best. To give him his due he is very cool at showing modern america through a horror lense, so if you haven';t read him you should. I would just start with ""The Summoning"" or ""The Store"" instead.."
3,I agree with Mr. Harjo,"I picked this book up because of so many glowing recommendations. The writing is genereally pretty good compared to others in the field, but I thought the ending seemed like the author either reached his page quota or just didn't feel like writing anymore - The ultimate evil villan is defeated in a shockingly dumb-luck kind of way by an unprepared and confused foe... Odd. The covers of his books are really cool though..."
4,90% good,"I really enjoyed ""The Walking"" until the last 30 pages or so. The story got bland. I'd say the part where everyone meets up at the lake was when the story went downhill. Maybe Bentley Little wasn't sure how to end the book.Most of the book had me glued to the pages. I loved the ""Then"" chapters better than the ""Now"" ones. Very well written."
4,The Walking Has A Good Pair of Legs,"Blending pop-horror and mystery with what can only be described as satirical humor, The Walking tries to be several novels at once and almost pulls it off, until the end.There are several genuinely haunting moments in the book and the flashbacks - once you realize what they are - are really well-done. Bentley Little even manages a few laughs without pandering for them, and the main character elicits pathos in his almost gumshoe pursuit to find out what is causing the strange events surrounding him and his father's erratic behavior.Given the solid foundation on which the book is built, the follow-through doesn't quite pull off what Little probably intended. It is, however, extremely entertaining and easily readable - I read the book in a single afternoon - and should definitely be given a shot for those looking to expand one's horror horizons."
4,the walking,"I think that this book is great. It is kinda hard to understand. I am enjoying reading it. Anyone that likes Bentley Little's writing, This book is the one. ..."
4,pretty chilling,"I have to admit, sometimes I think ol' Bently gets a little too far out into left field. However, I really enjoyed this book. It starts out strong, and although the ending was a little too wild, the rest of the book makes up for it. I would definitely reccomend this book for people who enjoy supernatural suspense."
5,Bentley's Best,"Wow! This was a sursprise. My friend Pam kept telling me to read this & I kept putting it off. I didn't think it was going to be very good. I thought it might be lame. I was wrong. I loved this book. It keeps the reader wanting to find out why these people are still walking. This is a true page turner. Loved the story as well as the characters. If you like King & Koontz,then you're going to LOVE Bentley!!!! I went out & bought 3 more books by him. Happy Haunting."
1,Borrrriiinnnggg!,"This has to be a first in my experience--a new and novel idea so totally ruined by cardboard characters and muddy plotting that I had to force myself to finish the book.The idea of a community of witches that is ruined by the prescence of an evil character sounds different and promising enough that I was looking forward to the book. However, the characters were so washed out, so thin and self absorbed, that I barely finished. By the end, I could care less what actually happened to any of the protagonists, I just wanted to see the culmination of the original idea.The plot was plodding and distracted. Even the ending, while not necessarily predictable, was totally unoriginal and seemed slapped together just to finish the book. This guy is a hack--don't buy the book, unless you love King at his worst (ala ""It"")."
2,The Walking Stopped Dead In It's Tracks,"I loved the begginning.. it was great, but the ending was rather lame. I think the author ran out of gas. I had many questions, and was trying to piece together loose ends. I was rather dissapointed. I have read other works by Mr. Little and have liked those... so I was surprised by the lack of an ending."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"While sporadically exciting this book proved to be a disappointment. It started well but went progressively downhill. The plot became less believable and the characters more cardboard as the story went on. There were a few plot branches which went nowhere and there was a definite contrived feeling to the latter half of the book. Having said that, there was a kernel of a good story here and the book worked best for me when the action took place in the village. The story was far too disjointed, however, to engender any sympathy for the characters and the paper-thin characterisation led to little sympathy for those 'taken out'. Also, the ending was a real disappointment. It was hard to believe that it took more than 300 pages to reach such a feeble finale."
2,fair,i like bentley little but this was one of his worst. it got worse as the story went along. a real letdown.
5,Cool and realistic,"it is cool and realistic, if dragon can be realistic at all. It looks like real small creature. Very good design and execution."
5,Great toy dragon,"Review by 10-year old w/ parental supervision:I love this dragon! It is very realistic, and has a great size. The only thing I'm disappointed in is that it has two heads. I do not care for the flame-shooting head. But, it is a great toy, and I recommend this to anyone who loves dragons as much as I do. This is definitely a must-buy!Review by 6-year old w/parental supervision:The eyes on the dragon are very realistic. This dragon has excellent wings. I do not care for the orange spots. I like the tongue. I like how the left arm is out. This is a must-buy!"
3,Fire broke off first day,My dragon-loving kiddoes of the family (our 5 and 9 year-old) really like this dragon but the fire broke off the first day. Not as durable as I would have liked but still fun.
2,Dragon,Tail broke off in fifteen minutes. I tried to super glue but no go. A bit disappointing from my view.
2,"beautiful clock, terrible quality","it surely looked pretty and when it worked it sounded great. The tone would wake you without being jarring. And then one day it just quit working. So we jiggled it and looked around to see what was loose.It worked again for a while then one day no more chimes. Something fell off. When I contacted the company to replace this $90 alarm clock we'd had less than a year or repair it the answer wasn't great. They'd give me a small credit but they couldn't repair it. I could apply the credit to a new clock.It really was pretty and it was great to wake up to, I just wish it had lasted a year."
1,"Lovely clock, miserable quality","Like other buyers, my first digital clock died at 6 months. It was replaced with little hassle, and the second suffered a failed display after three months. Great product when it works, but reliability is terrible for a clock of this price."
2,Just OK,"I won't go into a full synopsis of the movie. Suffice it to say, the ""suprise"" ending could be seen 20 minutes into the film. I thought it was so obvious, I just KNEW that there was going to be a ""double reverse"" with Adam coming out on top. No such luck.The ""play as a film"" approach didn't work for me, as I felt the acting was somewhat stiff in places, especially the Phillip character.Overall, just OK. LaBute's done better."
1,Wretchedly dull...,& flat & woodenly acted & pretentious & boring as hell. An imitation of an imitation of a derivative of something...but lord knows what.
3,Almost unique. Interesting and horrifying at once,"Watching this is defiantly an experience you can only have once like the car wreck that finally kills you. To sum it up, yep, Evelyn's definitely just a sociopath using art as an excuse to manipulate the subject for fun. She's just your typical example of a narcissistic ""artist"" who believes that they are the only ones who ""get it"" and their level of comprehension is above and beyond what others know. Watching movies like this makes me long for a movie like Funny Games the difference at least in Funny Games the deranged individuals have the good manners to kill you after they have had their fun and they don't expect the victims to thank them for attempting to improve their lives.Overall-Even if you just watch the last 10 minutes it will be a memorable experience."
3,not as great as the play,"I loved this play when it was done at my university's theatre. I thought I could enjoy the greatness again with the film, but it wasn't even close to as good.Especially for people not familiar with the play, it just drags with all the dialog.In theatre, there is motion in even the straight dialog that would look silly on film.Regardless, it is a true rendition. But if you can, watch the play in a theatre and not on a screen."
5,Wundebar!,This is an amazingly made movie based off of a wonderful play. I would highly recomend this movie to anybody who enjoys Neil LaBute or Paul Rudd.
4,Gets where it was going,"Weisz holds this together. It gets too talky at times but is nicely shot and paced pretty well. The ending is a nice nasty surprise. A little too bitchy for my taste but it does what it sets out to do, with a fair bit of aplomb and style.Solid comedy of modern manners full of acerbic edginess, brought from stage to screen pretty decently."
3,Six Degrees of Paul Rudd's Bacon,"Neil LaBute turns into the M. Night Shyamalan of the art house. This has pretty much the same twist ending as ""In the Company of Men,"" only this time around the actors trade parts, and the girl gets to be the jerk. If you want to see LaBute try something different, maybe check out ""Possession"" or ""Nurse Betty,"" two well made films I enjoy much more then his misanthropic ventures."
4,The amazing performance of Rachel Weisz will floor you.,"Dark and comic look into relationships may be mean spirited in places but does get the point across with a real poignancy that is valid in more ways than one. All the actors are great here, but its Rachel Weisz who not only steals the show in more ways than one but also gives you a depth not seen in a performance in quite some time. Her performance is not only spectacular but haunting as well, and will stay with you after its done. The ending will knock you right out of your chair, and leave you cold.That what good movies should do."
1,Terrible!,I want to give it negative stars but it won't let me. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Movies like this make me go back to the video store and rent another movie hoping that it will cure this illness I feel from watching it. How did this movie get made? I would have gone into detail about what I didnt like about this movie but then I wouldnt have been able to say how much it sucked!
1,"Wow, really awful","While the ending of this film is a surprise and a little interesting, it is in no way worth sitting through the rest of the movie. Truly stilted, awkward dialouge and some really unaturally bad acting makes this film painful to watch."
4,Rachel Weisz is only reason to see this film.,"Stagy but well done adaptation of the play lacks the electricity of the live play but it still has it dark heart intact. Rachel Weisz is becoming one of the most brilliant actresses around, and she is the reason this movie works so well. Her character is evil but in a strange way, you will end up liking her anyway, and Weisz does it so great that you would not mind if she did the same thing to you as she did with Paul Rudd. Her character will leave you speechless right after the credits leave the screen.Bless you Rachel Weisz for such a great performance."
1,Spoiler Alert,"Warning don't read further if you don't want to know the big reveal.So we find out the main twist is that a semi attractive girl can manipulate an unattractive man over the course of a fake relationship. Is anyone shocked by this? Woman can manipulate men with sex, what was I supposed learn by sitting through all this?The scenes drag out way too long. The acting is timid at best. I'm never rooting for any character through the whole film so you don't get sucked into to any of this. You just watch distantly as the movie ticks toward a sucky end.The DVD extras are sub par. The tour of campus is a total joke. I started listening to the commentary and its basically the crew talking about the music selections and patting themselves on the back about how awesome they are. I don't want to listen to these guys smelling each others farts. Ugh please stay away."
1,super snoozefest,"This is beyond slow and boring. It takes relationship flicks to a whole other level of stupid. Honestly, I started to fast forward and just stopped on Grechen Mol's scenes. Paul Rudd dials it in. Rachel Weisz is just plain annoying and whomever Mol's fiance was he just takes up screen space.If you honetsly think this is some brilliant pastiche of modern relationships...uh, maybe you need to get out a bit more. Bor and ing."
3,Rachel Weisz's performance is great but the movie is not.,"The Shape of Things is a decent movie but it feels awkward in a lot of places, and most of the dialog is a bit stiff. Rachel Weisz is probably one of the best actresses we have in our generation and she does carry this film on her back and for her performance alone, this movie gets three stars from me. The movie as a whole does not cut it in the reality department, and the whole process of Paul Rudd becoming a man was a bit ridiculous, and a bit hard to swallow because it was obvious from the get go on what she was trying to do and if he did not see what was coming, then he is much more at fault than she was because he let happen.Like I said before, Rachel Weisz is the only reason I give this film 3 stars but the movie really needed to pull itself together in order for me to take it seriously."
4,Get the American Roots: Blues CD instead,"There may be a couple songs on this CD that are not on the American Blues one, but I think one can give those a miss and not lose much."
2,Doesn't work if you're trying to upgrade from FTM 9,"I've been using Family Tree Maker for years and have come to depend on it for storing thousands of records of ancestors. The only thing I haven't liked about it is that it doesn't have enough flexibility for publishing a book, so I have to retype everything if I want to publish something. I've used Family Tree Maker 9 for a while and bought the upgrade to Family Tree Maker 2005. When I installed this new version I kept getting errors using my file from the old version. The support center couldn't or wouldn't help; I called repeatedly and they just said my file had been corrupted. So my review is not for Family Tree Maker in general, just for this new version."
5,Excellent program,"I finally upgraded from the old Ultimate Family Tree and I love the flexibility and the search cabability of this program. I have been able to find so much more information and document sources on the fly. It is a bit clunky at first so i suggest getting the User Manual, however, once you figure out everything you can do with this program, it's awesome!!"
3,1980s flashback,The episode story lines are a little scarier than I remembered from my childhood. Not so sure I want my kids watching a TV show about a kidnapping case. But it was a good trip down memory lane.
4,FINALLY!,"The Get Along Gang was one of my all time favorite childhood cartoons. I still have my original Get Along Gang plushies. The minute I found out this really *was* out on DVD, I had to get it. Okay, so it doesn't have all 13 episodes, or the Nelvana pilot, but at this point in time, beggars can't be choosers. It does, however, have all of my personal favorites on it, so I can't complain. Hopefully someday, we will get the complete series, but until then, enjoy what they will give us. It's better than nothing."
3,meditation,This dvd was informative from Jon kabat zinn and he explains why we go through the stresses of everyday life.The only disdvantage of this cassette is that you are expecting a full meditation class. It shows you a few brief techniques but is more focused on the interview with him and a meditation class he runs at the institute he runs.However it is interesting to listen to the points he makes.
2,"Not for Everybody, perhaps for Nobody","I found the first third of the book fairly good, but then in speaking about God the author switches from the third person to the first person, i.e. he begins to assume the voice of God himself. Even though I have attended charismatic churches where ""prophesies"" are not uncommon, I felt disturbed by the author's presumption. I must remind myself of the fact that the one common element in every Christian cult throughout the centuries has been the introduction, in addition to the Bible, of other authoritative literature presuming to speak on behalf of God. Another troubling aspect of the book is the anti-intellectual stance it takes with references not to rely upon reason. A warning flag should go up in everyone's head when this type of appeal is made. There are other devotionals that are better and safer reading than this one."
5,I want more by Dr. Creasy!,"I've always wanted to read Imitation of Christ but was a little intimidated. I heard parts of Dr. Creasy's Bible study and when I found out that he had translated IoC, I knew it would be wonderful...and it is! Very readable but clearly with the important and difficult message left intact."
5,Great piece of work!,"I remembered this from seeing the original on PBS many years ago. I was prompted to buy it after seeing a youtube video of a 12 year old South American boy sing ""Amazing Grace"""
4,Very good.. .old fans should be happy,"Ok for all of you older :W: fans who were complaining about Wreath of Barbs, Evoke, etc.... here you go. I had no problem with those albums, in fact I _really_ liked about half of the songs on Evoke. But for all you critics, Rudy has gone back to his older sound with this one. This is probably the best release since Eeevil Young Flesh, and I highly recommend it. Only one track on here has the female vocalist, and it's actually bearable. Lots of very dark heavy vocals on this album, I liked it the first time I heard it and now it's only getting better every time I put it on. It still has a bit more modern ""electronic"" sound to it on the drum machine/keyboards, rather than the ""dark industrial"" sound of the older albums (Embryodead, Bunkertor 7), but all in all I give this CD 4 stars and would almost give it 5 if it wasn't for two or three tracks that are just average.Overall, worth your money."
5,Tiny and cute,"These earrings are very tiny and very cute, the enlarged picture does not do them any justice, in reality the silver is much brighter. Very comfortable fit, I bought these for use in a helix piercing (upper ear cartilage) because these are so tiny I would not recommend them for normal ear lobe piercings as the post is on the shorter side."
5,perfect for multiple piercings,"These earrings are the perfect size for multi pierced ears. I use them for my cartilage piercings on the top of my ear. They are very pretty...once you get them on. Any earring this size will be difficult to get on. These are not earrings that you will be changing frequently. However, if you're looking for small earrings that are a little more interesting than just plain hoops, these are for you. I just wish they had them in silver with gold. It would be better to wear with both my silver and gold jewelry."
1,I suppose it looks nice,"Kohler product quality is #1. Product description is a Zero. Clearly states this is a slip-fit connection. I bought it and 'ASSUMED' 1/2"" copper, otherwise 3/4"" copper. Its labeled 5/8. What in the world is a 5/8"" slip fit connection. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Brilliant!!!!!!,Fantastic mix I love it his best ever you have to buy it words can not describe better then all his other installments
1,"Too small, cheaply made","The bracelet actually measures about 7-7.5"" closed. The clasp bends very easily, and the ""bar"" it clicks onto is actually an extremely thin strand of metal. I suspect it'll break within a week or so.Unfortunately, I bought this for my husband a couple days more than a month before Valentine's Day - it can't be returned.Ah well. At least it wasn't outrageously expensive. But save yourself the angst - don't buy it."
4,byzantine bracelet,"i can where an 8"" bracelet. but this one measures a 1/2"" longer. i have to get it resized smaller."
2,Tiny,"I was disappointed in the size of the bag. Perhaps the price should have indicated what I was getting. I can only get two-three items in it without it being ""crammed"". So everyday bag would not be the term I would use. It certainly can be used for an ""out-on-the-town"" occasion."
3,small handbag,"The purse is PRADA. It comes w/ authentic card & #. I have to say I was very dissapointed at first. I was sending it back IMMEDIATELY! It looked very cheap, nylon, it was small, nothing stood out for me. I put some stuff in it, & wow to my surprise it wasnt that bad. So maybe I got used to it, or maybe w/ the stuff in it, it looked different. So it is a little expensive for what you are getting. Looks like $10 purse, BUT its Prada! So if you want the name, or need a small bag this maybe ok for you. It has grown on me, & I use it often now."
3,Small bag,This bag came nicely packaged with an authenticity card. It's a little too small but I think it's fine for petite people.
3,Kids will enjoy...however..,"Read the fine print- these are not performed by the original artists, but rather by the Countdown Kids, who are really not kids at all. The collection is good, kids will likely enjoy it, however adults may be rather annoyed to hear second rate singers attempt to sing, for example, like Elton John in ""The Circle of Life."" Others songs are performed very well, though I had hoped these would be the Disney classics sung by kids like the cover leads you to believe. My daughter likes it fine and that's all that matters. Fine for the money, but not an awesome collection."
3,The pop formula continues to work....to an extent,"Human Nature are extremely huge in Australia but they have been unable to repeat their success in the States and England. The main reason is probably beacuse the album, in parts, sounds vividly reminscent of N'Sync and Britney (hard-edged pop). Indeed, BSB and Britney producer Max Martin has worked his magic on many of the tracks on this CD. Whilst that certainly is not a bad thing, there is a lack of material to separate Human Nature from their peers. Having said that, there are some gems here, including the brilliant Angel of Your Heart and current hit 'When we were young'. Overall, if your a fan of the aformentioned artists you won't be dissappointed, but if your looking for groundbreaking music you won't find it here."
2,Not very bright,"I was hoping these would be a bit brighter. Even for LEDs, these don't emit very much light. To give you a comparison point, think of one of those crackable light up light sticks from Halloween. Got that picture in your head? Now think about something that only emits about 1/10th the amount of light as that light stick. That's this night light."
2,Not bright at all!,If you are purchasing this to use as a night light then continue searching. It is not bright enough to provide adequate lighting. I bought it to use as a bathroom night light for my sons. I plugged two of them in and they still did not provide enough lighting to use.
2,Meh... Pretty low light output and doesn't have a light sensor,"They don't have a light sensor, so know that they will glow 24/7 and that the level of light that they output is quite low - barely enough to bump around in the dark but not bright enough to do much more than that. I'll be replacing them with some LED night lights that have ambient light sensors in the future. All in all, I'm sure these would be suitable for some things like bathrooms and narrow hallways - they just don't work well in larger areas like an open kitchen or areas where the power sockets are not in the ideal location (since they really need to be in the perfect spot to make use of their low light output)."
4,"Tiny, great if you don't need a lot of light","It's is best for younger people, don't buy it for the older person with balance problems. Outstanding energy savings if it fits your needs."
5,Great night light,"This is a great night-light, no bulbs or batteries. You'll need another light if the electricity goes out though. it is a green light, so be sure you're ok with that."
5,Sleepful Nights,"I found these glow night lights years ago and since they last so very long; I couldn't remember where the lights were purchased. You can't imagine how happy I was to find these night lights again. They produce a greenish glow that is enough light to see things, but not the incandescent lights that keep me awake at night. No more restless night for me. I even travel with them."
2,Not reliable,"I liked the glow from these when I first received them. I live alone in a small apartment and don't really NEED nightlights to get around or avoid waking other people, so this was more of a comfort purchase. I put one in my hall and one in my bathroom. Unfortunately, one of them stopped working after only a few days, so I returned both."
3,Very Dim but Does its Job,"I would have preferred the light to be slightly brighter but for the price and nice small size, I won't complain. I have this plugged in our bathroom . I can't see well enough to brush my teeth but it gives enough light that I can make sure not to stub my toes on anything when walking in the middle of the night."
1,Useless!!!,"I agree with one of the review that says all the 5 star reviews are from friends and relatives! This light is pretty useless as a night light. There is just a patch of green where this is plugged in and nothing else! You can't see anything in the room with just this light. I wanted to return this item. Amazon refunded my money and wanted me to keep this item! Even though it's free now, I don't know for what purpose these could be used."
3,Good flat nightlight,"This item does not illuminate the room. It is just bright enough to let you know where the wall is. Being just a few milimeters thick, it does not stick out from the wall outlet, and would be good for hallways and other dark areas with a lot of traffic."
4,Not bad,I like the low power consumption and compact size I just wish they were a little bit brighter. There best in bathrooms and bed rooms.
3,"ok, but not a light","this simply places a light glow. It does not provide much light, more like and iridescent glow that's good for letting you know where the wall is."
5,Not too bright,This works well. Our old night light was too bright. This one is just right. We leave it plugged in all the time. There is now a gentle green glow that can be seen at night.
4,An easy start to appreciate Hopper's work.,"This book is quite easy to read while sometimes it's not easy to enjoy the pleasure of an art work. Edward Hopper, an icon of the realistic painter of the U.S.. Solitude, isolation and alienation are common emergence in many Hopper's work. It's like reading a novel of metaphor leaving ""readers"" a huge space to imagine the context of the painting. The book provides a lot of clues for us to step into the ""Literatural world"" of Hopper."
2,Fragile,Handstands Morf Stress Relief BallsI bought these for my middle school counselees to use. The first one broke on the first day. These may be great for adults but are too fragile for active adolescents.
2,adds stress...,"Having read the other reviews for this, I am now concerned that the ball will fail in short order.The surface rapidly gets blemishes, and has a slightly sticky feel to it. My feeling is that the outer covering is weak and can easily break. Now that I know the contents are a gooey ink (in my case, red ink) I am afraid that it will fail and create a disgusting mess.Even with that aside, the product has some problems. The cheap rubber exterior leaves a smell on your hands, and since it's slightly sticky its surface gets dirty and is hard to wipe clean.The only upside I see is that the low cost means that I won't feel too bad about throwing it away.What a bad design for a stress-reduction product."
1,Beware of Morf Explosion,"My husband and I enjoyed destressing with this product for a few weeks until --as described by a previous reviewer--the product exploded, with its contents oozing, creating a mess that took an hour to clean."
1,Junk,"It wasn't great even while working, and like others described, popped after a few weeks of normal use. The liquid inside is absolutely disgusting. You would think the manufacturers would have an ounce of sense and put a non-stainable dye inside, but nope. It exploded all over an expensive Persian rug and I have not been able to get it out yet. The rug may now be worthless. DO NOT BUY."
5,My coworkers love these!,"I am an IT Director and bought these for exercisers for my users. The outside is like a balloon, only much stronger rubber, and the inside is gel. When you squeeze them, the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color - it's cool! The resistance is very good and my users love them! Good product - great value and excellent quality!"
2,cheesier than the hulk doing a comedy routine.,"If your a stlouisan and have some nastolgia, might be the only reason consider this purchase. They were a nuno short of extreme or a horn player shy of the fishbone or the urge. How can you take an album seriously, when the opening song is about playing with yourself and the drum fills use the cowbell."
4,Friends Galore,"there are two important reasons to read this book. It was Dickens last complete novel beore his death in 1870. You will find many characters coming and going, but have no fear, there are three themes to follow; the golden dustman and his wife, and two love stories. The other characters are interesting because Dickens made them so. Call the second reason ""a make good."" Dickens was criticized by the Jewish community for his depiction of Fagin in Oliver Twist. He did't realize that the characterization would hurt a community. In order to balance the scale, he created the appealing character of Judah Riah, one of the first appealing Jewish characters in english literature.Our Mutual Friend is a long book, but that just makes it more Dickens to love."
4,Lazytown,"I'm not sure where my toddlers first learned about Lazytown, but it's a nice swith from the normal pre-school cartoons they normally watch. I wasn't sure they'd really follow the story, but now they totally do push-ups like ""Sportacus"" and sing and dance like Stephanie. Lazytown has 3 real people on an animated sets with puppets. I honestly didn't think the DVDs would motivate kids to exercise like other people say they will, but apparently they really do and they're entertaining to watch!"
1,Big Disappointment,"I was excited to find these tapes at my library and kept waiting for the ""magical"" love to reveal itself as it did in Waller's novel. Instead, I was told all sorts of ""filler"", such as what Jana St. James was wearing and what she ate each day. An unbelievable amount of extraneous material to blow smoke over her THIN story about an average affair initiated by a married man. One can only feel sorry for Waller's wife Georgia, learning what her husband was doing the night they gave birth to their daughter. Much wishful thinking on the part of St. James: I didn't see ANY parallels with Madison County, the novel, except that the characters had sex."
2,How one girl's affair in college haunted her,"I was looking forward to reading about the woman the book ""Bridges of Madison County"" was possibly based on. When Robert Waller was a young, married graduate student, he had an affair with whom I feel was a naive underage college student. Jana St. James wants us to believe her love affair with Mr. Waller was like no love ever before. Sorry, Jana. You had an affair with a married man, and it ended because he had obligations to his WIFE. What did you expect? For him to leave his pregnant wife and start a new life with a young, naive college girl? I don't think so. Also, the affair -- the ""earthshattering"" love she experienced is exactly the same as any other ""first love"", no more special or different, except that it was with a married man, and Robert Waller is just a man who has talents such as writing and signing. He is no more special than you or me."
3,Jana & Bob - a simple love story,"Certainly there are parallels to the love story in Bridges of Madison County, however this is a story of two young people who under different circumstances would likely have ended up together. There love seemed genuine but impossible. This is an easy read - and unlike the other reviewer, I do not judge Jana or Bob. As unfortunate as it sounds - affairs do happen."
5,A seminal reference for new social critic,"This book is curiously completely unknown in France, where the other titles of Ruskin (on Gothic, or Venice) raised a long tradition of interest. Published in 1860, this text is a reference to the Gospel (the parable of the workers of the 11th hour). It is a Christian answer to the theories of Adam Smith, Ricardo, Stuart Mill and the same,who launched the disastrous economic conceptions which led the world where it is now. A theory of mankind only based on its supposedly fundamental selfishness, with no consideration for creativity, generosity, disinterestedness, and any other form of concern for the general interest. It is worthwhile reading especially now after the collapse of the marxist theories."
3,This movie is BEE-UTIFUL!,Most killer-bee movies are real stingers(sic)but this modestand well produced film is a exception. The ever-reliable Johnsonis a Louisiana sheriff investigating a child's bizarre deaththat turns out to be the work of a swarm of African killer beesthat eventually attack the New Orleans Mardi Gras. The attackscenes are surprisingly potent and includes some GRISLY makeup.This movie manages to build suspense quite well and providesa clever off-beat ending. Worth a look if you have the honeyI-I mean money.
4,"The Lion, the Witch, and...","Honestly, I loved this book, and I've read it time and again. The characters are well formed and the progression of their love-hate relationship is magnificently told. I did think that Brenna's stubborness was a little over-the-top in the beginning, but I loved the book once she started thinking with her heart instead of that fiery mouth of hers."
4,A VERY ENJOYABLE BOOK,"SAXON LADY BRENNA HATES THE NORMANS AND NOW THAT KING WILLIAM DECREES THAT SHE MARRY ONE OF HIS MEN, SHE IS LIVID AND VOWS TO KILL ANY MAN FOOLISH TO TRY AND WED HER. BUT THE FEARED RYE DE LYON, WHO IS KNOWN AS ""BLACK LYON"" DOES NOT HEED HER THREATS AND TAKES HER FOR HIS WIFE. EVEN WHILE SHE DENIES HER PASSION FOR HIM, SHE IS SLOWLY FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER ENEMY, ONLY A HIDDEN BETRAYAL AND A DEEP ROOTED FEAR THREATEN THEIR HAPPINESS!! THIS IS A VERY WELL WRITTEN STORY THAT TAKES ITS TIME WITH THE CHARACTERS. YOU REALLY GET TO FEEL THE PAIN AND PASSION."
3,Downhill,"This not-quite-sequel to Moorcock's brilliant award-winning Behold the Man is actually a collection of tales told as remembrances of past lives, held together by a framework of identity-destroying depravity. In all, this book's literary quality is not quite worth the dreary mood it creates in the reader, as it drags you into the heart of hopelessness and insignificance. An effectively disturbing work, much like its loose predecessor, yet it does not have the thought-provoking plot nor the social message of Behold the Man to make the trip worthwhile. Unless you enjoy being depressed, avoid this one."
2,Not a good introduction to Moorcock,"Strange but true: I got this book as a birthday present from my AUNT when I was 12. Had she read it, I'm sure her heart would have skipped a beat and she would have headed for a confessional fast. This is a dark, disjointed novel which should supposedly please fans of time travel but it doesn't. The main character ages year by year in each chapter, traveling from one depressing historical setting to another. Particularly unsettling is the chapter where he slaughters a whole Vietnamese village. Interspersed are passages on his growing sexual awakening--growing homosexual awakening, I might add: here I was reading this stuff at 12! By the way, doesn't the guy on the paperback cover look like Sting?"
1,Handle with Care......,"Neat packaging, and pretty pictures, but don't invest in this unless you enjoy hunting for substitute yarns and experimenting. MANY of the ""called-for"" yarns are already discontinued by the manufacturers (in early 2005 - book published in 2004). Of course, you can use substitutes, but unless you're familiar with the original yarn, deciding what will be a good substitute won't be easy, and these are largely ""novelty"" yarns, not easily matched."
3,Not very impressed....,"I have to say I wasn't very impressed with this item. The laminated cards are nice, but I personally didn't understand the instructions too well - a few illustrations to explain the required stitches would have been nice. As far as the scarf designs, again, not that impressive. Yes, several of them were pretty, but I don't think anything was overly creative - once a specific stitch or two is learned, I'd think one would be able to come up with a similar design without having to spend the money on a box of designs. I'm new to knitting, so a more experienced knitter would probably have no problem understanding the instructions. But I would assume an experienced knitter probably doesn't need these cards to come up with the designs? But you might, so if you're looking for some nice scarf ideas and you don't need illustrations to figure out the stitches, then you will probably be happy with this item. As for me, I sent it back."
2,Agree with cathy,"It's very disappointing that many of the nicest scarves are nice because of a yarn, most likely discontinued by now, and not because of the reason you buy this box: the pattern."
4,Worth the money,"I know people will look at the price of this post and think this is expensive, but it is worth it. It is tall enough for my adult cat to stretch and scratch at the same time and my 7 month old kitten loves it because she can climb it. I agree with the previous reviewer that I wish the top was wider, so I deducted it one star too. Two of my three cats began scrating it the same day it arrived! A well built and sturdy product, I have no ""buyer's regret""."
5,The ultimatet scratching post,"My cats love it. It is tall, strong and sturdy. My cats use it constantly and love to claw their way right to the top."
4,Underrated,"Everyone seems to hate this release, but I like it a lot. It's nice to listen to while drifting off to sleep, and I disagree with anyone who says that it is, ""a waste of money"". Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do may not be perfect, but most followers of the band will not be disappointed."
3,A medicre CD by a great band,"I agree with the other reviewer.This is a great band, but this CD is mediocre - well beneath their level of ability. There might be something to this CD I'm missing - was it a soundtrack? Was it intended as background music for another project?It's not *bad*, and I don't dislike it. But the album is thin, and it's not near as complex as their other stuff. It makes nice ambient background music, but it's not much to listen to on its own.I very much like this band, so I would suggest buying one of their other CDs. My favorites are Recycle Bin, (), and Takk."
2,"Not very good - not bad, but not very good.","I bought this EP on the iTunes store a few weeks ago. Not bad, but like I said not very good. I wish I hadn't bought it, waste of money. I love Sigur Ros, don't get me wrong but this is a waste."
2,BA-BA BA BORING!,"Where is the Sigur Ros that I know? This cd is very chaotic and fizzy in it's production and the songs all remind me of MUM, whose songs mainly consist of blips, chimes and annoying beats that take a listener no where special. The songs on this EP are boring. I hope the bands new upcoming full length album is a lot better than this. I am giving this 3 stars mainly because I love this band so much and just HOPE that they get better and come out with something not as dry and uninspired as this release."
1,"ok, not quite","so, i love everything about this band. the amazing scenic sounds. the beautiful and slow to develop sound that eventually envelopes you into complete and utter bliss. but sorry, this album sucks. maybe if i was icelandic and didn't realize that all this album is is baby talk played against my alarm clock. so, i still love these guys and appreciate their attempt at using daily noises to create music, but it also has to sounds good! but i'll be waiting and hoping the next cd has a bit more to offer. cheers"
1,Ros Fan,"I would like to first say that #1, I have never written a review on Amazon before. #2, I consider Sigur RÃ³s to be one of my all time favorite bands. That beign said, this CD/SIngle is horrible. This isn't Sigur RÃ³s, this is very bad electronica. Jonsi's voice is nowhere to be heard, the ambiant guitars and drums aren't prevalent either. In fact, they aren't even there. This CD took out everything that amkes Sigur RÃ³s Sigur RÃ³s. The beauty of the voice is not there. Instead, there is an electronic voice, making very annoying statements of ""Baba Ti Ki DI DO."" over and over again.Also, there is not instrumentals here. It is 20 minutes of the same sound. The same keyboard line is played over and over again and becomes very monotonous. I lvoe Sigur RÃ³s, but this CD is just a horrible waste of money. As soon as I popped it in, I knew I had made a mistake. Don't buy this, and pray to God that Sigur RÃ³s goes back to what makes them unique and amazing."
4,In preparation for their next album...,"Far from being a bad album, but definitely not their best work so far, Sigur Ros warm up for their next full length album coming later in 2004 with the work in this 3-single-long EP. Minimalist chimes, spacey loops and overall, a more atmospheric sound than their preceeding productions 'Ba Ba / Ti Ki / Di Do' (so named after the three songs that make it up) is a highly enjoyable work, and one that constitutes both, a natural next step after the brilliant '()', and a move by the Icelandic crew in perfect sync with the post-rock musical times.At over 20 minutes of duration, with a solid opening and closing track, this EP can either be a perfect opener or wrap-up for the experience of listening to the soundtrack of 'Lost in Translation', with which it shares many common traits. I give it four stars only for the second song, that I found a bit weaker than the other two."
3,Overindulgent but not without merit,Mildly successful mini experiment feels a little to weirdly strained or self-absorbed at times to truly bring out what they were striving for but still contains enough splintered beauty to pick and choose your moments.
2,Oh for goodness sakes...,"Okay don't get me wrong, I appreciate highly artistic music, but this is just ridiculously over the top in how artsy it is.. to the point where it ISN'T art. It's just silly. This is like the famous pun of ucovering a completely blank canvas and everyone gasping and being in awe over how amazing it is. This is just stupid, it's not even music, nor does this take creativity or talent. This is just pure pretentiousness. It is a great thing to be creative and take risks..but this, really, is a joke. I read the song titles and nearly choked on my coffee."
1,what was that?,"I bought this ep and admittedly expected something like ( ), or Agaetis Byrjun. After listening to it, I found myself sorrowly disappointed and happy that the ep was so short. I compare it to what I imagine it would sound like inside the head of someone being classified as ""insane"" and locked up in an institution. Otherwise, it was dull."
1,Crap,The punch part isn't very sharp. you have to have a certain type of paper that's not too thick or too thin for it to cut.
1,poor performance,"Doesn't work as expected. Cuts thin paper, but its hard to slip the paper out of the cutter with out tearing it. Doesn't work with thicker papers, which is what I actually needed it for, to make tags."
3,Fiskars Squeeze Punch,"These work well, but not for what I wanted to do. Don't work well for doorhangers because hole is punched too close to the edge."
1,"No, thank you.","This is the second Fiskar's Squeeze Punch I've bought. I returned the first one because it ripped the paper around the edges of the circle.Thinking it may have been a fluke, I bought another size.Better but the punched out circle still has tiny rips along the edges. Returning it tomorrow."
1,Flimsy and cheap materials,"I used my punch for the third time -- and the moving handle literally broke in my hands. I was not using a death grip; indeed, I have rather small hands without a strong grip. The handle broke off and is irreparable. Oy."
3,Decent but not the best!,"Hi there. So i bought the Fiskars squeeze punch ( i have the large circle) it's a decent quality and cuts an acceptable edge, but i would not say its the best for the finish. Squeezes very easily (which is great if you have problems using regular punches). works best on light to medium weight card. Although it cuts a perfectly shaped circle it tends to give the card a wavy edge that you need to flatten out afterwards. When buying from Amazon check in the ""Product features"" section to ensure you have the correct numerical size eg. 1.5"" as Fiskars has just labeled this Large. Once removed from the packaging the tool does not have a label anywhere on it showing you the size of the circle I found this inconvenient when choosing from several circle punches.Have a nice day"
3,Do you want the circle or to get rid of it?,"Same deal as my review for the 1-inch puncher: it can only push in about 3mm (less than 1/8 inch) from the edge of the sheet of paper - fine if it's the circle that you want, but terrible if you want to get rid of the circle and keep the sheet."
2,Limited use,"If you are punching items ""stand alone"" these are probably okay, although the spread on the handles is almost too wide for my hand to grasp comfortably. However, for me as a card maker, they are pretty much a loss because the depth is about 1/8"" which is no good at all for positioning. I'll figure out a way to make my circle dies from Spellbinders work. If you are looking at being able to position a circle cut on the interior of a page, don't get this."
3,It was OK.,"This book was OK. The author had a good blend of well-known stories with lesser-known ones. But I grew tired of the undocumented ""this happened to a relative of mine"" and ""I'm the only one who knows this"" stories that read like campfire tales. Many of the sections are literally only 3 or 4 sentences and state only the location and that ""some say it is haunted"". I was interested as to why but no reasons are stated or incidents/evidence are given. Try'Chicago Haunts' by Ursula Bielski and 'Haunted Illinois' by Troy Taylor for better local haunted tales. I gave this book 3 stars because the author is a good story-teller."
3,A succint compilation of Chicago-area supernatural stories,"In this compact volume, Mr. Clearfield has collected a variety of brief but engaging explanations of the Chicago area's most popular ghost-related tales, along with a large number of lesser-known stories from nearby Joliet, Illinois. If you collect books of regional ghostlore, you'll want this for your collection."
2,Not too bad,"Though far from brilliant, this book seemed to have been written by someone with a sincere interest in the haunts of South Chicago--mainly Joliet, stories of which were heavy in this volume. I'd like to see them fleshed out a bit."
2,Rapping Rocky,"This Rocky 5 soundtrack pales in comparison to its other Rocky predeccessors. The whole album every track is mediocre rap, even tracks by MC Hammer and Elton John. Lacks the appeal of Gonna Fly Now, Eye of the Tiger or Hearts on Fire. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but diehard Rocky fans."
2,This soundtrack is no comparison to the other Rocky soundtracks.,"This CD doesn't have as good of songs as the other Rocky soundtracks do. I enjoy listening to the instrumental songs from the other soundtracks way more than listening to the Rocky V CD. Rocky V is the worst of the Rocky movies. The song ""Measure of a Man"" is fair; I bought the CD because I liked that song. Some of the other songs aren't in the movie; they're just inspired by the movie, which stinks. The inspired songs are junk and some of the songs from the movie are also junk."
2,Emptiness,"This album leaves one with an overwhelming sense of emptiness. It's not that the individual tracks are uniformly bad, but the lack of variation and the 'manufactured' feel make for rather too much of a muchness. Neither MC Hammer nor Snap nor Elton John can redeem this soundtrack to the ultimate in lethally boring modern sagas. Should have been called ""Rapping To A Dead Horse."""
1,A bad ending for a great saga . . .,"Back in 1991, my father bought me this album as a birtday's present; I listened to it and I didn't like it. And you know why? Because I spected that this album had the excellent songs of the Rocky movies. In those days I used to listen to rap stuff because I was a kid, but now after refining my musical appreciation I think that this album (compared to the other four CD's) is a bad ending for the Rocky movies; it has many bad songs (the only good one is ""The Measure of a Man"" performed by Elton John)."
2,"Too much soundtrack, not enough (any) score.","The heart of any Rocky movie lies with the amazing music. For the first film, we had ""Gonna Fly Now"" and Rocky's theme. For Rocky II, the thoughtful ""Redemption"" theme. For Rocky III, it was a ""Mickey"" and the unforgettable ""Eye of The Tiger"". Even Rocky IV managed to impress with Vince DiCola's ""War"" and John Cafferty's ""Hearts On Fire"".Rocky V has...MC Hammer.That by itself wouldn't be too terrible, except for the fact that Bill Conti's music for this Rocky film is overlooked completely by the producers of this soundtrack. The one redeeming musical moment in the film was when a rearranged Rocky's theme blares during the final moments of the streetfight with Tommy Gunn.The CD does not have that track on here, eschewing it to make room for another MC Hammer song. I wouldn't spend more than $5 on a used copy of this and certainly not $46."
5,Inspirational,This is among some of the best music to listen to if you're into physical fitness. Highly recommend it.
4,Perfect Match,"The Polyphonic Spree and my all-time favorite, Elliott Smith, are perfect together on the soundtrack to such a great film. Worth picking up just for the cover of ""Trouble."" ""Move Away and Shine"" is another highlight."
2,Smith Die Hards Only,"Having not seen the film and how the music is woven into the narrative, I shall only say, that as an album, free of images and cinematic context, the music here is banal, dry, and expunged of interesting melody. There is melody here and there, but it is constituted around an array of endlessly boring arrangements and mediocre singing.I certainly understand the difference between an actualized song per se and music composed as filler, accenting the images or plot. But this is too much filler and not enough song. For a great album with both songs and cinema-based compositions, see The Graduate soundtrack or Harold and Maude. The Polyphonic Spree continue their role as a poor man's Wayne Coyne. Two stars for the album and Five for Elliott, Cat, and Big Star. Smith die-hards need only purchase."
5,Glad to find old faithful,My dad bought one of these plugs years ago for our old tub. Recently I needed a plug and I even remembered that old floppy plug and hoped I'd just stumble upon it. I DID! It's the best!
3,handy stopper for travel,"I used this on a recent trip to Italy. It worked pretty well, as long as I was careful to verify I had a good seal and didn't get to aggressive in squeezing the laundry against the sink while washing and rinsing. (If the sink is small, you can occasionally bump against the stopper and dislodge it.) All in all, I'm happy with the purchase."
2,Short of the mark!,"Wanted it as a sink stopper, hopefully to be used in bathtubs, kitchen sink, etc. Tried it in the kitchen sink and for a short time it seem it was doing the job, only to watch the water drain a little later. Not at all what I was expecting for such a simple looking device. I thought somehow it would stick until pulled out, making it an efficient sink stopper. Does perform for a brief interval but nothing like I was led to believe by the positive reviews. Still, it can be used if you are fast enough but nothing to praise its performance. 2 Stars."
2,WAAAAY OVER PRICED,i got this exact same product from dollar general for a dollar and a quarter. it came with four other stoppers for the kitchen sink bathroom sink laundry sink and tub. for a dollar
5,"Excellent, for the purpose it was intended for...","Let's be clear, you won't really learn esperanto using only this book. It is too limited as to it's scope. However as a simple phrasebook and dictionary for the occasional esperanto user, it does quite well. It's a great little book to carry around (unless you have room to carry a full dictionary or a complete language workbook) in your purse or briefcase.As a small travel book for travelers who ""may"" use esperanto in their tavels, this does the job quite nicely."
2,"Great phrasebook, poor dictionary","The phrasebook is decent. It's got some decent sections, that would work well as a vocabulary builder.But, for a dictionary it's not good at all. The words are poorly chosen, and the definitions are limited. I'd recommend it for a beginner, but a serious student will want a more complete dictionary."
2,You can do better,"As a teacher of Esperanto, I found this book to be more the work of the author's imaginatin rather than an accurate portayal of how Esperanto is used. I can spot people who speak Esperanto after learning this book and they generally need some remediation, and as far as authoritativeness, this book has little credibility. To get a better picture you have to go out and use Esperanto in chat rooms and at meetings."
3,Praising with faint damns ...,"This is a convenient little book for the individual who may occasionally use Esperanto but doesn't want to learn it in depth. The grammatical overview seems to be quite good, though the section on affixes could use some examples. I can also recommend the phrasebook section. The dictionary, however, should not be used without having at hand a more authoritative dictionary against which to check it. I particularly enjoyed the author's comment about the need to determine the transitivity or intransitivity of Esperanto verbs (p. 7), coupled with the fact that the dictionary does not provide this information either implicitly or explicitly; see e.g. ""komenci"" on p. 36 or its equivalent ""to begin"" on p. 66."
1,Not much of a dictionary,I bought this several years ago from a bookstore which ordered it for me. Had I known that the dictionary is sparse in content I would have passed it by. If you are looking for an excellent Esperanto-English dictionary search for Concise Esperanto Dictionary.The phrase book portion of the book is hardly worth reading. There are a few gems but nothing that one couldn't learn elsewhere.Esperanto is a fun language to learn and this book does it no justice.
3,You can do better.,"Do you want good dictionaries? I started out with John Wells and Butler and was pleased with both. Butler is a gem, a classic, as is his grammar. Benson's English-Esperanto for Americans is a breakthrough of sorts and is appropriate to the locutions of English speakers, but still needs a little work to make a really good second edition. Errors have crept in here and there, and the Esperanto translation given is not always the most popular or the most elegant. You may want to contact the Esperanto League for North America... Bonshancon!"
3,"Nice features, bad range","The basic unit is very nice. I have a previous Oregon Scientific unit, and wanted to upgrade to get the barometer trend, humidity, and moon phase. Besides the LCD contrast not being as good, this LaCrosse unit is great.BUT, the range from the transmitter is TERRIBLE. Even with all brand new batteries, they can't be more than 20-25 feet apart, which is about HALF of how I've had my other OR Sci unit running for years.For this alone, I would hesitate to recommend to anyone. Tech support did not have good response/suggestions."
3,Weather Station,"The weather ststion works fine except for one problem. The area that is supposed to display the date displays 12:00. I have made a phone call and sent 3 e-mails to LaCrosse regarding this and have yet to receive a reply. The product itself is OK, but their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Unless I am contacted shortly, I will not buy anything from them again."
3,A boon for string players,"As a pianist, I bought this book thinking that it would give me a deep insight into prodigies and was a bit dissapointed. It's well written as an overview/survey but is not very deep. Other than Bejun Mehta's personal essay, this book doesn't delve very deeply into the psyche/emotions/life and long term psychological journeys of prodigies. As a classical pianist, I was dissapointed with the chapter on Cliburn which was basically a collection from quotes from published sources but very little, if any, personal thoughts and real honest to goodness information about Cliburn as a person and a pianist. The author is a cellist and there's a certain bias towards string players in this book. Overall, this is a good introduction to the world of prodigies but those seeking a deeper/more detailed analysis/insight into prodigies should look elsewhere."
4,Strong and Secure_(BUT),"This HD Hasp is strong and securely built, however I have one issue with it.Mine has been installed on an outdoor yard shed for 4 months. I live is a High Salt environment and the hasp is begining to rust."
1,"""Party"" Impersonation","Despite the listing of ""Various Artists"", leading you to believe that this collection of favorites is by the original artists, the CD set states on the cover that the songs are performed by some no-name imitator. If you want the original artists, don't buy this. If you don't mind having the imitators, then by all means by this."
1,"California Drifting, ho hum....",This is a very poor drifting movie made by amatuers. It is actually about a drifting event for entry level people. The interviews contain no valuable information and the drifting action is meager at best. Your money would be better spent elsewhere.
2,an appaling copy,"This is a thoroughly old-fashioned film derived from the Anthony Price novel of the same title, which was, goodness knows, complicated enough to sort out. The film does not entirely succeed in clarifying the plot, even with a good cast working hard at it. It would be an enjoyable experience nonetheless, were it not that the Osiris Entertainment copy is quite appalling. The visuals are garish, badly reproduced, the color sometimes going a liverish dark brown or pink and completely blotting out expressions on faces. As for the soundtrack, it is practically inaudible so that an already complex plot is made virtually incomprehensible by the low level audio. Swathes of low-key conversation are impossible to decipher. Avoid buying this product at all costs. The production is a disgrace."
1,Extremely disappointed and I regret buying this.,"The charm I ordered is ridiculously small and the name ""Julie"" isn't even centered properly on it and is written extremely small and seems prone to fading away. I am totally unsatisfied with this and the title of the item itself is DECEPTIVE by including ""Italian Bracelet"" when its really just a charm about 1/5 of an inch in diameter. This is a complete waste of time and money. 1/10."
3,disappointed,"I have to say, the four laser links purchased were really nice and arrived promptly. However, the laser links are wearing off and fading within weeks."
1,No heavy duty here,"The price is right but you get what you pay for. I was hoping for something more than just a thin, flimsy glove that fell apart in one day.Much prefer the True Blue household gloves, they live up to their name, ""ultimate household gloves."""
2,Panasonic PV-GS19 quality is poor!,"I just reviewed so many cameras and thought this was the one!After my second one (did a exchange) I have to find a new camera. In low light and even average light situations there is these ghost like artifacts that follow the image! Very noisey and bad! If you move the camera up and down or left & right you can see this ""double"" image lagging and following! It almost looks like an ""effect""! You only see it on a TV screen, not the EVF screen. My Sony hi8 looks 100x better! Out door light is pretty good though. I also own a Canon XL1 3 chip so I have higher standards I guess but I thought this was a lens defect (it can be seen ""live"") but after an exchange I can see that they're all the same and other people just don't notice or care.I wanted a good quality small camera for home use but I may just have to lug around my XL1!"
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get the camera. I had a lot of work I needed to do with it. I got all my equipment set up, then was so disappointed that the sound in the camera didn't work. I sent it back and got a refund. I would hope the vendors would make sure their products worked before they sent them."
5,muy buena,"Yo uso esta camara para montarla en motocicletas deportivas expuesta a mucha vibracion, somplemente nunca ha fallado, segue trabajando como nueva a pesar de ya tener mas de 20 horas grabadas bajo estas duras condiciones."
2,No software or cable to transfer to PC,"beware of the low price, panasonic has managed to make the price so low ($350) because they don't give you any software for the computer (to transfer or to edit), and no cables for the computer. I can't believe they would neglet to put them in the box. Your better of with PVGS 15 as it comes with the software and a USB cable, the price is $500, but the software, cable, and still picture on sd make up the $150 price difference."
1,don't buy it,this product does not include the usb cable and its driver for connecting to a computer. cannot understand why those important accessories are not included. panasonic is either an idiot or does not care about its customers' needs at all. you will need to order it separately from the custom service. and their service sucks!
4,Good cam.,"I bought this camcorder, like everybody else, because i need small, digital, and low-cost. this camera does all that, and the outdoors video quality is excellent.It's not fair to compare this model with 3CCD or other much more costly models, but i will say that the EIS is not very good, and particularly poor when used in low light-lots of image smear. Of course, i think EIS stinks, period...Overall, buy it. Best at price point."
4,Nicely done,"If you liked or found this book useful, you might also like ""The Healing Journey Through Retirement"" by Phil Rich and Dorothy Sampson. It's a book about the transition from work to retirement, and talks about how to make retirement a meaningful and satisying experience. The book provides lots of good ideas and information and uses a journal writing format."
1,Incorrect Part Number does not fit Civic EX/SI,"Be aware this does not fit the Civic EX or SI even though Amazon says it does. This is for the LX, DX with the smaller dics"
3,The Party's Over,"I personally thought this book was extremely dramic and it dragged on.But someonelse might like it. This book was about a girl who had everything she could of ever wanted in high school until the summer of senoir year when the conversation changed from clothes or movies to college. She wasn't planning on going to college and found it annoying when everyone talk about it. Well, I thought she was the most annoying person in the book. You will have to read the book to find out how her life changes when her friends go college and sne is stuck at home trying to get a job."
5,"It's not five stars, It's 10!","This book you have to read. It's so like me& all of my frineds, it's increddible. Haley & Jaz really set the book straight. You have to read this book if any. It's not too long, so don't worry. I finish it in 3 hours. I've read it 19 times, and I can't think of anything better to cul up in front of a fireplace& read. It's thrilling..........get it. You won't regret it. I promise."
4,Heartwarming,"Inner-city youth discovering their strengths, pushing limits and getting a chance to see the world is heartwarming. The actual double dutch jumping is pretty exciting.The best part of the film is that the you the viewer, can vicariously become a part of the team."
4,good enough,"Looks right, and appears to be the same kind of plastic that the one I am replacing is made from. I just wish I could find one made of metal, so I would not have to keep replacing them."
3,Color doesn't match Danco sprayer,"Does the job, but the color is not an exact match to the Danco sprayer. It not that they are so different - it's like one is nickel and the other is brushed nickel.[...]"
4,Facts that entertain,The illustrations of sharks and their relatives are rich and engaging. Extinct animals are given a symbol so that kids know which ones are alive now and which ones aren't. My son has favorite pages and names most of the creatures after only a few readings.
3,"What, no Great White?","This was a good book and my kids enjoyed it, but were disappointed that there was no Great White under the letter G. Nor was there a Hammerhead under the letter H. The hammerhead was in there under the letter K, something I have never heard the hammerhead referred to as. Other than that, a good book."
1,trivet,Didn't like the color or the size.Just wasn't what I had expected. I returned it.It did arrive quickly and no problem with the return.
1,This is not China,"Please read Mr Ross's review, which I agree with wholeheartedly. I would add to him that this book does not refect China in the least. For example, the author refers to the ""best hotel in Shanghai"" as being Jing Jiang, whatever that is (the best is the Portman Ritz Carlton and has been for years). Despite what the author says, one would never find ""100 cigarette butts and 3 used condoms"" under the bed of the finest hotel in Shanghai, nor would a ""Room Boy"" enter without knocking every 5 minutes.This entire book says nothing about China today, so with a weak plot, silly characters, British words in the mouths of Americans, there is really no reason to waste time on it, like I unfortunately did."
5,Joe Gunther,I am hooked on Joe Gunther. Up to #13. Can't wait for evening to come and spend it with Joe.
2,Too Many Characters,There were too many characters to keep track of. I could not keep track of who was who. Archer Mayor is a good author but this one disappointed me.
5,Outstanding story and outstanding writing,"This is at least the 10th Joe Gunther mystery I have read, and all of them are outstanding. Not only is Archer Mayor an excellent writer, he is an excellent creator or plots. His knowledge and research of federal and local law enforcement in Vermont and Canada adds immeasurably the the reality of his stories, and somehow he keeps creating another great Joe Gunther mystery or two each year. I hope to read them all, and I hope he never runs out of ideas or energy."
2,Frustrating writing style,"Disappointing, Long winded, disjointed script. Reduce the excessively long description of the geographical areas visited by Gunther and the book would be about a quarter of its size.In book # 5 of the Gunther series ""The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree"" it seemed that Archer Mayor was running out of ideas and this book reinforces my view. In previous books I liked the simplicity and uncomplicated style of the writing that, while there was plenty of embellishment, still allowed the plot to come through. This is not a book that can be read every night before retiring without losing the story line but rather it has to be read in one or two sessions. Unfortunately the general story line is not gripping enough for that.I cannot award even one star to this book.With so many books in the series I may try one more in the hope that Mayor's style improves."
2,Not the Archer Mayor as usual,I have read any number of the Joe Gunther series and have enjoyed them all. Not this one. It was putting me to sleep. To many odd sounding names that were too much alike. I lost the story and it wasn't worth trying to figure it out.
5,"buffy, Buffy, Buffy","This is easily the greatest show to never be watched in the history of television. The first season sets the enter Buffyverse into motion and anyone fortunate enough to get thrown into its orbit will be forever faithful to this tale of a girl. Just a girl with extraordinary powers.The picture quality is great and all of them are shown in the original form. No commercials, no edits, no adjustments just pure beautiful Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
3,ETERNALLY HAUNTED BY Sarah Michelle Gellar,"TV series beginnings can be classified into 2: first season could be the very best of the entire series or it could be a little naive until the producers matured all the ideas, plots, characters and everything involved. With Buffy I lean on the fact that it was the beginning of one of the best 90's series, however, the series is still naive and innocent. Who would not love Sarah Michelle anyway? I do, passionately! The dark/doomy lights sorround them everywhere, haunting and heartless vampires can come from anywhere. The Watcher's British accent gives style to it and the different villains: possessed hienas, cyber demons, ''chuky'' vendetta toys and a gang of vampire soldiers give 100% entertainment to you. Overall you must get the rest of the series so you can plenty enjoy it. but this was the beginning which launched Joss Whedon to Stardom and the res...is history! Did I just mention that I would love Sarah Michelle forever?"
3,"The show is good, this DVD set a bit of a beat","This season DVD set has half the number of episodes the other seasons do. The drama and the humor and the excellent acting are all here; the video quality is very good, the extras are not lavish, but not bad. The quantity is a bit skimpy. A better value than some movie DVD's, truly. Later seasons with a full 22 episodes are the same cost. I blame Fox."
2,great show.. bbaaaaaad dvd,"There are 100s of other reviews saying the same thing but I just had to add to the dissent. The video itself is muddy. The menus are extremely sub par (no 'Play All' and so on), many skips and break ups and so on... For the price you would think it would on a technical level be as good as the tapes but it barely is. It is sad that companies KNOW people are going to buy it anyway, so they half-ass it anyway (farscape series dvds comes to mind)."
2,"It's Buffy, but video quality is poor.","I'll let everyone else point out how great this series (and DVD) is, and then I'll agree with them. But there's one thing you should know before you buy the U.S. release: the quality of the video is not what you've come to expect from DVD. There are a lot of DVD video artifacts: grainy picture, slightly posterized color, ghosted and haloed objects, indistinct dark scenes, and jittery image detail.And as if poor encoding wasn't enough, one of the discs was physically defective! It locked up in two different players, and upon visual inspection, it looked as though the layers of the disc were improperly bonded.I'm exchanging this set, in the hopes that this its replacement won't have this problem."
5,The best TV show ever!,"Proud to say I started watching Buffy with Welcome to the Hellmouth, and have been hooked ever since. The characters were much better looking than my friends :) but they talked just like them...I wish there were more extra goodies on the DVD, but there's the commentary by Joss Whedon on the pilot that is totally worth the purchase price. I can't wait for Season 2!"
3,Excellent season,"Buffy the vampire slayer is one of my favorite shows. This season is one of my favorite seasons. My favorite episodes from this season that I like alot are: 'the witch','the puppet show','nightmares'. I love 'nightmares', it was very cool to see Sarah Michele Gellar as a vampire."
4,The season that started it all!,"Buffy is a great show, which may not appeal to many different age groups, but does appeal to fans of many different genres, horror, comedy, action, fantasy, romance, and drama (the last two being far more abundant on season 2). Season 2 and 3 are considerably better than season 1, but season one is still a must to own, particularly if you are new to the show. If you're pretty new to it, or have only caught a few random episodes on TV it'll get you started, and you'll enjoy the other seasons much more. And even if you've seen every episode it's still nice to have around to watch every now and then. Some episodes are rather dull to see over and over, but some such as the pack, and teachers pet are a joy to watch countless times! The show really has it all. Oh, and the special features on the disc are pretty nice, but too few."
4,Classic Buffy!,"I loved to watch Buffy in high school and I recently purchased this and found it just as enjoyable! Season one is a great introduction into this high energy series. Buffy comes complete with her quirky friends, quick wit, and her awesome jump kicks. All in all this is a great season. The only thing is that there are only 12 episodes! So beware, but it's a great purchase! I'm halfway through season two and it only gets better!"
5,Great Seller!,Took a while to get the DVD but was not the fault of the seller. He worked with me to send another copy out. Got it the other day and it was brand new. Would do work with this seller again! thanks!
4,An excellent collection for fans,"I didn't start watching Buffy regularly until the second season, so I hadn't even seen some of these episodes. Watching them now, though, makes it easy to see that all the elements which make Buffy so good were in fact present from Day 1.And the commentary from Joss Whedon is a wonderful insight into the series (thematically and practically).I would have given it five stars, except that the disks were a bit hard to navigate. It was tough to figure out how to access the commentary and other extras. And there should have been more commentary.I guess they have to save something for ""The Complete Second Season"". I can't wait for Spike to once again get rid of ""The Annoying One""."
2,"The show is great, but a pain to download and it takes forever","Buffy is as Buffy does. It's a fun show, the review is not about it, but about the way the Kindle takes FOREVER to download. Don't think you're going to grab a series on the run. You're not.Still love Buffy, and I enjoy watching it on the Kindle when it's down loaded, but it probaboy takes 30-45 minutes to download."
3,Do NOT install PCFriendly,"My copy of BtVS Season 1, requested installing an application, PCFriendly. After attempting to view the DVD through this software, the video would freeze a few minutes into playing the first episode! I was able to watch the DVD with my existing computer DVD software. (Run your DVD software first, then open your DVD through its interface.)With a few web searches, I found out the PCFriendly is *spyware*, shipped on various DVDs between 1996 and 2000. The software otherwise allows you to access web-like ""interactive"" content on the disk.Pretty obviously, I don't recommend installing this software. As for Buffy web sites... I think you can find a good number of them, spyware-free, on the net."
5,Have a Marathon!,It was just as wonderful as I expected it to be. All I can say...is invite your friends over for a Buffy marathon and enjoy!Second season was also great....both are limited on the extras but it's great to be able to see them all without adds and complete (without the extra cuts put in the reruns to add even more commercials)
5,Buffy Slays Me!,"I had never seen the first season of Buffy so I jumped at the chance to get this collection. I WAS NOT DISAPOINTED! The humor is great and is more than worth the price of the DVDs! Sure the whole Vampires/Hellmouth/Demons thing is a bit far fetched, but for pure NO-THINKING entertainment it can't be beat. The characters are funny and the story lines are good. After watching season one I had only one question....when are they releasing season 2?"
3,"Excellent Episodes, Bad Wuality DVD","I absolutely love Buffy. It's the coolest show ever. I was so excited when I heard that the complete first season was coming to DVD. When I purchased it though, I was extremely disappointed. First of all, the picture on the three DVD's suck! This is due to the ep. being shot in 16mm. Second is the packaging. When I opened the DVD package, the second DVD kept fall out of the package slot. Not to mention how scratched up they get. I recommend that you put the DVD's in a cd holder and not use the package. Third is the features which I won't even bother with. They are horrible. Finally, how come in the UK, four seasons are already out on DVD for Buffy, and 2 for Angel? In America, things are sure running slow!! Anyway, besides all this, the episodes are fantastic, just no the DVD or the quality."
4,Great content. No Extras.,"Phenomenal. Joss Whedon's Buffy is the most creative thing on television right now (The West What?), and here's how it all started.Like a televised comic-book, Buffy brings in elements of action, romance, comedy and good old fashioned teen angst together in one great package.Its too bad, though, that the DVDs are light on extras. I mean, we waited forever to get them while Europe already has season four on DVD. You'd think in all that time we could've gotten some screen tests or bloopers or cut scenes?Oh well. I still love it and am awaiting season two!"
3,Good show - horrible picture quality,"The first season of any show is a little different. The actors are still 'finding' their characters, and relationships are not yet developed. So watching the first few episodes is a little awkward, but the show grows on you. It is good.My main complaint is the quality. The DVD transfer was done horribly, or maybe they just used VHS tapes to make the DVD or something. It's very grainy, the worst in dark scenes. Hopefully the later seasons will be done better.Update: I've since found out that for budget reasons, Season 1 & 2 of Buffy were shot on 16mm film. This is what causes the extreme grainyness of any scene that doesn't have a lot of light. Despite this, the show is amazing, probably one of the best ever put on television."
3,Buffy kicks @ss!!,"To anyone who wonders why the meager 3 stars, it's in comparison to the following seasons which were amazing. After the cancelation of the WBs fantastic SAVANNAH i swore i'd never watch another WB show ever again. Fortunately i broke my promise. The episode that won me over was ""The Pack"", after watching this episode i became a loyal fan. Buffys first season had its share of problems, some cheap looking special effects here and there, a cheesy script here and there (willow falls for a killer robot, praying mantis lady) but overall the show had a lot of heart and charm. One thing i LOVE a bout Buffy is each season is a self contained story there were never any lame season finale cliffhangers. The main villian in this season was The Master very one dimensional, menacing but not really interesting. It was a solid start for what turned out to be a brilliant series. EP"
5,Buffy,"I loved this show when it was on television. Then I had to go in for surgery and my cable was all screwed up, so being able to purchase this and watch the entire season was awesome."
4,I'll admit that I had only seen one episode -the musical one-of Buffy before getting my hands on this box set.,"It's a great set that should please the uninitiated and well make long-time fans happy enough. The low price and the quality of the presentation help make it an easy decision to buy, here's further sets will continue this trend."
4,okay,i bought the first season because i'm in love with the show the dvd's are great they have no scratches but the case is a little messed up but all in all its worth what i payed
4,More commentary!!!,"Obviously, the episodes are wonderful. I wouldn't have ordered this DVD set if they weren't. But after being ""spoiled"" by Joss Whedon's commentary on the first 2 episodes, I could barely watch the rest. His behind-the-scenes stories were wonderful! Hopefully the next set will feature even more of these commentaries.Now, if we can just get to seasons 3 & 4, where the series really shone. I can't wait!!"
4,A good starting season...,"I started watching Buffy at the end of season one, so watching these for the first time was cool. I was great learning all of the background on the story. So, it was more educational for me. The story telling wasn't too great though. Buy season 3 for the complete package. Buy this one only if you're a fan--like me."
3,Off To A Weak Start But It Gets Better,Buffy's a great show. I never really got into it until the DVDs came out. This first season release may contain all the shows but it certainly lacks in extras. Even the menus are bland and it doesn't seem like they tried all that hard. It's not like this set was rushed. The X-Files sets were great from the start but Buffy Season 1 will be the odd ball of the series.
4,Welcome to Sunnydale,"This season isn't the best. But it must be part of any Buffy fans collection. It did, by the way, introduce us the the butt-kicking blonde(not to mention the loveable Willow and Xander).Buffy Summers is the new girl at Sunnydale High. Shes pretty clueless(if I remember correctly) why she is actually at Sunnydale. And that, of course, is to fight vamps. Sunnydale is actually located on the Hellmouth, which is basically a place where alot of demons reside. She meets her watcher, Giles, the school librarian along with the quiet Willow, the comical Xander, and the snobby, yet likeable Cordelia. This is when the fun starts and Buffy begins to fight vamps and other demons.Some of the episodes are a little too much ill admit. For example Teachers Pet(c'mon, it a praying mantis?). But that isn't anyones fault. The series had just started, and was allowed to make some mistakes.I seriously doubt the writers knew what would become of Buffy, Willow, and Xander by the end of the show."
3,Great Show,I gave it a 3 due to the picture quality isnt that good on some scenes.My wife even walked in and said is that a dvd.I sorrily had to say yes.Season 2 is the same way.But season 3 is totally different.Great picture quality and good depth.Whats up with the other 2 seasons.
4,A must See,It's been awhile since i've watched the first season..I love watching it AGAIN..and AGAIN!
1,"Episodes Are Great, Extras Aren't","I love this show, and was thrilled when they began putting the seasons on DVD, but there is a HUGE problem. I can't get to any of the extras on the DVD, like photos and scripts. I have the correct button on my DVD remote, but when I push it, I get a black circle with a line through it on the screen. It doesn't work. Same goes for Season 2 DVDs, and the same thing happened with ""Angel,"" Season 1. This is a HUGE technical problem, one which I wrote to the company about, but got no response. For shame!"
2,"Great show, DVD a huge disappointment","This review is not about the show itself which, on its own merits, deserves five stars. However, the reason I purchased the DVD was because I expected the picture and sound quality to be excellent, or at least an improvement on the TV broadcast.Imagine my disappointment when I found the picture to be grainy and pixellated - like a poorly ripped, low bitrate MPEG - and the sound, muffled and flat. To add insult to injury, the picture and sound quality of the (non-Buffy-related) Fox advert at the beginning of disc three was, in stark contrast, outstanding.It is disrespectful, and a disservice to the loyal fans of such a first-rate show, for Fox to release such an embarrassingly mediocre product (and, frankly, a shameless cash-in).I don't know if the original, more expensive, DVD release is any better, but I would advise anyone thinking of buying the new release to look elsewhere, including VHS."
5,Buffy - Coming of Age,"The story of Buffy is basically teenage girl coming of age and having to deal with her divorced parents, a new high school, making friends and oh yeah vampires. In all the shows you have that sci-fi element but if you look closer you see there is an underlining story that you need to pay attention to. In one of the shows you see the importance of a good mother daughter relationship and long before high school violence became broadcast news Buffy was trying to show us how important it is to not treat people like they are invisible. Buffy is a great show that just can't be defined. One minute you fear for Buffy's life and the next you are laughing. If you haven't gotten into Buffy yet then there is nothing better than starting at the beginning! I'm sure that the quality of the show will make you a die hard Buffy fan."
5,Great start to a wonderful series,"season one of buffy isn't the best season but it is a really great start to a great series with plenty of laughs and enjoyment, the season that made you love everything that was buffy. and angel, who could resist him. I will always be a buffy fan. this series is a must have for any buffy fan."
3,"Good cast, half decent writing NO CONSISTENCY.","The headline says it all. There are some good cast members. The writing was pretty decent, just not great. BUT there are several instances of back and forth between Buffy and Angel from show to show and in some cases if you don't watch BOTH series you miss things."
3,I don't understand this season.,"I enjoyed several other seasons of this show but this one was just missing something. Plus, I never understood who Angel was exactly and why he liked Buffy, but maybe I just missed something later on. Plus why does she like him and Spike anyway? They're both vampires, but oh well. I'm just slow. Still, this is a pretty good season, I'm not complaining."
2,Horrible season,"Worst season of the series, followed by season 4. Horrible dialog, horrible acting, horrible plot. Everything is so generic, and cliche, it's unreal. Cordelia's character cannot be popilar in real world, she is just too abnoxious and superficial. Xander is plane annoying from start to finish at the end of season 7. However Willow is adorable and Giles is hot. Buffy's character is not a hero type at all. Sarah Michelle Gellar was obviously very wrong for this role, Faith's character later in the series is much more believable than hers. All of her fighting moves are awkward, and her lines are cliche, she just doesn't stike you as a vampire slayer. She is too little and too cheerleader type for this role. But of course she has to defeat the main villain with superhuman strength and magic who's been planning the apocalypse throughout the entire season in 3 minutes and still be on time for a high school dance."
4,my least favorite season,ok i love this season but compared to all the others it was terrible not to mensoin buffys hair
2,worst season ever,"I am a HUGE Buffy fan, but I hated this season. I am a Spuffy fan, and there was no Spike. Even if I wasn't a Spike or Spuffy fan, though, I still would have hated this season. There was hardly any continuing plot, except for the short scenes with Angel, leading up to their two kisses. It was very boring, with another random theme each episode, and I would have to say the only episode I liked was ""Prophecy Girl"". If you want to watch this season, order it from the library or buy it used, but don't waste good money on it."
4,The beginning of one of the best TV shows ever.,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer sounds like your mediorce teenage cheesy tv show, doesn't it? Well guess what, It's not. I started watching BtVS since its debut and I must say it's one of my favourite shows ever.Let's talk about the First season, It is my least favourite season of the whole seven, But that doesn't mean it's not good. It's the perfect introduction, with fun, campy episodes such as ""The Pack"" and ""Teacher's Pet"".So do yourself a favor and introduce yourself to one of the best tv show ever and rent/buy this set and trust me you'll be running to the video store to get the other seasons."
5,BtVS Season One A Must Have For All Buffy Fans,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer was one of the best TV shows ever on television.Buffy Season 1 is a great DVD for ALL Buffy fans. I started watching Buffy of March 2005. Now, I've saved up all my money to buy seasons 1-7! I only have season 1, but it's a start.Also, Joss Whedon is a wonderful writer. His show is so well written that it still suprises me of all the plot twists."
5,Awesome,"Only recently discovered Buffy, but am hooked. I just loved this DVD and can't wait til Season 2 to come out."
4,great,"This product is great. I have been a buffy lover for a long time and it's great to be able to get the season at reasonable price. The dvd is great, i just wish it made it clearer on the order the episodes come in. The quality of the dvd is good though."
4,A must-have for all vampire fans,"Joss Whedon, the writer, really shined in this, his best television series, with a great deal of talent and effort. Though not the best season of Buffy, it has many endearing qualities that evolved to perfection in future seasons to a culmination in season three. However, if you want to know the background of the characters, as well as see how this widely praised series has its roots, check this out. The dialog alone is worth the price. You won't get enough of the trendy phrases that, believe it or not, were invented by the writers and were not gathered by hanging out at local high schools. And finally, get a look at Willow in those freaking leggings."
4,It's about time...,"...that they release Buffy on DVD! I was hooked from the day it premiered until the day they graduated high school, and then picked it up again with the infamous Musical episode (Once more, With Feeling). And it still gets me, 6 years and running.Sure, some of the jokes are pretty corny. A lot of the jokes are pretty corny, I mean. And sure, some of the ""actors"" need a bit more training. But the trick is to see that stuff, and still love it for its quirkiness and its truth. And I'm not talking about vampires or demons, I'm talking about the characters and they way they face day to day life. That's what makes it incredible, because admit it or not, most of us can find that bit of ourselves in each of the characters.As for Joss Whedon, it's hard to put into words exactly how I feel about him. He's a geek (a term of endearment coming from me) in the best sense of the word, he's a geek who made it, and I cheer for him on behalf of geeks everywhere. It's our show."
3,Nice Start... Shame about the quality?,"Ok, i have the Region 2 version of this DVD set. The series itself is great, and has a strong plot, although some episodes are not as good, they still develope the characters we know and love.Unfortunately, I had to give this set a low rating because of the transfer quality. Any movement on screen results in horizontal lines breaking the image and making some fast scenes very unclear.I hope the region 1 version has solved this problem, if it has, I'll change this later!!!!"
1,"Five star show, one star DVD","I too was unlucky enough to receive a defective set. The third disk is completely unwatchable--it will not run for more than five minutes without skipping or freezing. I've asked around and found that several people have had similar problems and that it is a manufacturing error. Fox needs to fix this NOW. I have taped the entire series run and still, I would gladly buy every DVD set they release for the higher quality and durability. If I'm going to keep getting poor quality products, however, I'm not going to bother.Also, there are typos in the cast/character bios. It doesn't feel like a lot of effort went into creating this product. Which is a shame, since to show is so fantastic."
4,Reminisce and Revel in the Beginnings of Buffy,"For fans of the show, especially those like me who became enamoured at once but have been unable to follow since (due to location, not preference...) this was a delightful walk down memory lane. Although this does not contain my favourites (unknown season), I finally had the chance to view one that I had originally missed. I just love the interplay between characters!"
4,The Slayer...INTRO,"To the first season of Buffy. It's the perfect place to begin, to start in your quest to join the....Oh, who am I kidding? It's A Hot Chick Defeats Supernatural Menace With Subplots. And it happens every week. Not to say that it's not good. It's incredible. Like watching a horror-comedy with teen angst elements every week. I hate to be pushy, but Dawson's Creek could have benefited from a demon here or there--it would have kept things lively. That's one of the many reasons Buffy rocks. It's also consistently well written, and well acted to boot. Gellar, Hannigan, and Brendan are fantastic, and Stewart-Head exercises a keen and careful eye over them as Watcher.It's all good..villains, subplots, everything. Mark Metcalf is a standout as the Big Bad Vamp of Season 1. Buy it, rent it, watch it...first rate."
4,"Great content, below average picture quality","The Buffy content of this DVD collection is great, but the picture quality is below average. I have a few broadcast episodes on VHS that have better picture quality that what's on this DVD. Even so, hearing Joss W's commentary on a few of the episodes makes this collection worth the price for Buffy fans. It's worth having, even if it's not up to the video quality you would expect from a DVD."
5,It doesn't suck.,"Ok, that's an understatement. But first season is only the bait for the rest of the show. It's not any individual episode that gets ya (yeah, right, just ""Hush"" and ""The Wish"" and... um...you get the picture)What I was saying though. First season special effects were bad. The fight scenes were bad. But the show itself is pure magic, special. It's hysterical. It is perfect for what it is; absolutely a gem, never seen before and never to be repeated. Each character is an archtype, more vivid and clear than life. They're the distilled essence of parts of ourselves, brought out of our hearts and minds.Thank you, Joss."
4,A Must Have For Buffy Fans,I haven't seen the first season of Buffy untill I got it on DVD but this is a great thing to add to your Buffy collection if you have one. This season is important because it shows the begining of the show and it introduces you to the charaters. It has great episodes.
5,A truly great show,"'Buffy' is one of those shows that I like and would watch casually, but knew that I wouldn't really get into it until they started showing reruns. Although it isn't as good as later seasons, I was able to get a friend interested in the show with these episodes."
3,editing problems,"maybe this is unrealistic, but I had hoped that all the breaks would have been edited out. Also, the beginning of the show, showing the characters and the actors-- I wish that had been edited out too. All in all, it wasn't all that much different from being quick on the vcr trigger with pause.However, I bought this DVD mostly because I watch them a lot and for some reason when taping them, I seem to always miss one or two of the episodes. At least here, they are in order."
5,Great,"What can I say? Buffy is probably my all time favorite show and these DVDs are great! By the way, the season 2 DVDs feature a cooler menu system and more extras."
4,"Yea, the show is old. Get over it.","It looks like an old grainy vhs tape, but I think that's what they had to work with back then. Great show, and this is the founding season which picks up after the old movie. If you are a true fan, you won't pay any mind. It's kinda like watching an old black and white movie. After a wile, you don't even realize that it is not in color."
4,amazing...,This season was very well done and very well anticipated! It layes the foundations for all the future funness that is Buffy which comes after. :)
5,Huh!!,"Okay I love this DVD but this question is for Buffy Freaks like me. In episode 7 Angel- the master tries to kill Buffy with the ""three"" and then Darla. Why would he try to kill Buffy when he knows about the prophecy in ""Prophecy Girl"". Dosn't he clearly say if she didn't come he couldn't leave. Why try to kill her. This is the only episode where he delibritly attempts to kill her, but why. Wouldn't he have screwed himself by doing this.Or was he just trying to injure her..."
1,Far too corny for me to ignore,"I find this show to be fairly good in total, but I find the first season to be absolutely awful. I only find a couple of the episodes to be not so bad, but the rest are simply horrendous. Not only do they have poor stories and directing, but they also can't even make a descent fight scene. Season 1 has almost nothing going for it. I just find it miraculous that after this the program was given a second season, which is a good thing since they managed to pull it together."
4,great buy!,"ok season one isn't the best season(very close but season two wins)but in order to get the other seasons you gotta have season 1. Some very very good episodes actually they all were spectacular except for ""i robot you jane"" (bad writing) but still watchable. The best episode in the season is ""prophecy Girl"" really great.( these are all my opinions people) this season introduces us to angel a very dark character he is dark but really hot! buy this season and start your collection! please take my advice!"
3,An entertaining slightly off-beat modern novel.,"This one sort of defies categorization. Is it a ""ghost story"" or a ""mystery""? Maybe a bit of both, but a macabre novel without being a horror story is my best description. Almost like Kafka, but without the edge. Anyway, an entertaining novel set in modern Venice. A love story, in love with the intrigue of this historic city, or at least infatuated with its oddities. You will keep reading and you might even learn some interesting bits of Venetian history and culture along with your entertainment."
5,"Pretty shnifty, but what's with the ending?","I've never read anything else by the author before, but I was very impressed by his language and his knack for storytelling. He tells a haunting tale of old cities and ghosts and stories and all that other great stuff. The ending was a little awkward and seemed a bit rushed, but don't let that deter you--on the whole this a great novel. Short and sweet, and an ideal way to spend a few hours."
1,Madrid: Agreed! One star is one too many.,"Message from Tokyo to Madrid on Gerardi's attempt at a novel: you're dead-on solid, mate! Bloody bollocks, who is this chappie trying to fool? Shifts a ghost story from one continent to another, tosses in Venice for exotic local color--guess Brooklyn only works once, eh, Gerardi--and follows the plot of Madeline's Ghost like a cat in Venice follows rats. Now there's a novel idea: a cat's ghost, female cat of course, reappears after eight centuries and reintroduces the bubonic plague, ah the Dread Black Death, to all of Italy! Back to dead writers for me, whose work is far more alive than that of too many contemporary novelists, including Gerardi. Madrileno, whoever you are, God bless you and keep your head to the sky. Viva Espana! Viva Hemingway! Viva Madrid y Tokyo!"
2,Where's the ending?,"I picked up several interesting tidbits about my beloved Venice from Robert Girardi, but was left with no satisfaction as the ending is somewhat...nonexistent? Thanks for the atmosphere, but the story never really went anywhere."
3,If you love books set in Venice...,"I read this quite some time ago when I was searching for mysteries set in Venice. It was a nice enough read but not remarkable. If you are hungering for the atmosphere of Venice, I would recommend this book."
2,Would be great except for...,"I thought I would love this book - but it spoils its beautiful descriptions of Venice and its culture with graphic, unnecessary sexual references. Written by a man for men."
2,Vaporetto 13 - What Happened?,I was so disappointed in this novel. After having enjoyed Girardi's previous two books - both haunting and insightful - I can't figure out what happened here. Mr. Girardi must have been sick lately.
2,Fair,"As a brand new bag I have purchased, the packing is not as nice as I expected. I was expecting a good packing, ie. plastic film covered over the bag handles, but it has not.One of the bag is a gift for mom; and she was wondering if it is a second hand purchase. =(Plus, I have bought two bags (same model, but one is Rosso and one is Capri) and the size has came different! =Y though prices are the same. Which I am very confused."
3,It's ok.,Cute sporty bag. The nylon fabric is a bit flimsy and the bag has no shape. It would have been nice if the bag had been more structured.
1,total garbage. avoid!,"as a shaw brothers fan and a fan of japanese monster movies i was intrigued by this title and thought my sons would like it. they were begging me to turn it off. it's bad on every level. horrible acting, mind numbing plot, putrid effects and costumes...i read some of the favorable reviews here and imo, i think people liked the idea of thismovie more than anything else. Fans of B rate movies can find things to love in thisgenre. don't be fooled by this trash. you'll be sorry, trust me. it's that bad."
5,Super inframan!!!!!,great movie awesome dvd/video quality. took me back to when i saw this movie the first time in 1985!!! great chop suey action and story line. Good movie by the shaw brothers. wish there was a follow up sequal to this film. Funny this movie came out before the six million dollar man aired on t.v.
4,"A GOOFBALL, LOVEABLE HOOT!","I first saw a wonderfully badly dubbed ""Inframan"" on TV some years ago and fell in love with its laughable dialoge, remarkably bad special effects and rubber suit monsters. This movie must be seen and appreciated for all its wonderful awfulness! Lines like: ""This disaster is so bad .... it's the worst in the history of the world!"" That bad, eh? A five-year-old could have dubbed this movie better. Anyway, I love this movie for its crazy and bizarre monsters and villans (and sometimes grusome action). Watch this one with friends and have a party. Just, please, don't take it serious. The Shaw Brothers apparently didn't."
3,Still in my brain 20 years later...,"I saw this movie back when it first came out on video. People always talk about cult movies but this is one they don't talk about. It is such a ""B Flick"" that you're embarrassed to admit you've seen it but at the same time it sticks with you. If you see this as I did (an impressionable 14-year-old) it will definitely shake you up a bit. Watch it a few times and you'll never forget it. You have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it."
3,it came from above....,"As far as these types of alien films go, this is one of the better ones. Considering when it was made and the budget the filmakers had to work with, they have done a pretty decent job. Yes, there are scenes where it crosses into foolishness (the army doll hunting down the old hag in the downstairs apartment comes to mind) but there are also some pretty gruesome and intense scenes as well.The story beings as ""Sam"" is abducted by aliens. His son is the only witness. Some years later he returns and goes right to work savaging a local lass. She gives birth to his human form (this scene is not for the squesmish..)and he goes on to disrupt the lives of his old family. The end of this film has some real nice scenes of bodily deterioration as Sams body breaks down exposing his alien form within. This is an entertaining, albeit average entry in the field of alien terror."
1,E.T. meets Chucky!,"Man gets kidnapped by aliens. Then he returns as one and gets a woman pregnant. Then the woman gives birth to the same full grown man, and dies while doing it (obviously!). Then the man rejoins his family, but he looks weird and they smell something fishy. Then he brainwashes his son and turns him into an alien too. Then the son turns into a lifesize G.I.Joe doll and kills people. Then he turns into a clown and kills more people. Then... oh well, you get the idea!Then Maryam D'Abo takes her clothes off and frolics around with some guy in her birthday suit. Then you don't feel like a total jerk for watching (or buying) this picture!Then again, you are!"
3,Xtro,"The quality of the DVD is clear & very good. But I love to watch this movie when I was young, but right now, I dont feel it so scary anymore like last time when I watched this movie"
2,"a fun watch, but don't buy it","I saw this movie roughly 15 years ago. It has a weird place in my mind... I've never forgotten it. It's interesting to watch, in the same way a car wreck is. I would recommend seeing it for the strangeness but, for the love of God, don't buy it... wait until it comes on cable and tape it (so you can watch it again)."
1,Suitable only for the Brain Dead,"Below average re-telling of the ""alien lands on earth"" cliche found in most American horrors of the 50's except this time its done terribly. The actors are all monotonous grade z-horror fodder, namely the woman who was in one of Lamberto Bava's early works, equally as bad as this. The story goes haywire when there is a midget clown attacking people with an absurd hand saw and the end doesn't really tell much about the intentions of the alien. Terrible film......"
2,Pretty bad movie... even if you love randomness.,"First of all the special effects are bad, but this is to be expected in the early 80's. It's almost bad enough to look like it was made in the early 70's though. I wasn't expecting too much here though, so no surprise.What's disappointing was the story. I enjoy random events in movies (The Lost Highway for example), but this movie was random half the time, and the other half it tried to tell a story. This conflict made it impossible to enjoy the movie. It had 2 or 3 enjoyable scenes, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. But they weren't enough to make this movie bearable.I watched the commentary by the director Bromley-Davenport after the movie. Can you be any more ridiculous? He trashed his own movie for like 10 minutes - ""This film is just trash."" And you know what? He's right, this movie sucks. I wouldn't even call this a decent B movie."
4,this freaky british alien movie gets a pretty good DVD release!,"Super gory, nudity, bizarre surreal script, this movie really feels like a drug trip. Although it was made in 1983, it feels more like one of those weird 70s horror flix. Definitely a must see for fans of schlock. But beware the third movie, which is also on DVD. It's awful.The film gets a 1:85:1 transfer, enhanced for widescreen TVs. The image is pretty sharp and clear. The print wasn't cleaned up at all, and there is a lot of specks, dust and hairs visible. The audio seems to be mono, but it is sharp and clear.The 2 alternate endings are very short, one is nearly identical to the original, the other is a good alternate take, and the one deleted scene is only 35 seconds long. You also get an interview with the director and still shots of behind the scenes.Now let's just hope xtro 2 makes it to DVD."
1,"Hammermill Tidal MP 20lb 3 hole paper 5,000 sheets (16203-2)",This was a box of paper. It was delivered on my doorstep on a rainy day and was soaking wet when I found it. I was home at the time with the door open. All the carrier had to do was knock on the door. I suspect it was already wet and he didn't want refusal of shipment. Every ream of Paper was soaked as was box it was packaged in.TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE - DON'T ORDER PAPER FROM AMAZONHAM162032 - Tidal MP 3-Hole Paper
1,very superficial and redundant info,"this book is a repeat of the basic tenets of investing. It is very shallow and repetitive. The experts' (Davis,Bramwell,Papp,Yacktman,Stovall) views have been known for years and have been expressed by them in the mediaThe biographies of each of the experts, which absorbs more than 30 pages is unnecessary and boringOverall, I was extremely disappointed with the content,all old hat and redundant."
5,Insightful Approach to Investing,"I bought this book after seeing Kazanjian on TV. It's really an excellent guidebook for investing. The book is also very interesting and easy to read. No complicated formulas, just good common sense that every investor should follow. It's also interesting to read about the gurus Kazanjian interviewed. It's like getting a great biography and investment advice in one book!"
2,"Warren Can Do Much, Much Better","I'm disappointed with the material Warren has presented here. While he has some good tips on Bible study, they are too varied and could leave the average reader confused. I can only give two stars for the lack of simplicity. Each chapter could be a booklet by itself. I also don't favor his implication that all modern translations are equally useful in doing serious Bible study. Nothing could be further from the truth.Simply put, Warren can do much, much better. For anyone looking for a book on studying the Bible, pass on this one. Look instead to Kay Arthur's ""How to Study Your Bible."""
2,booklover,"Love Rick Warren but didn't love this book. Tedious and remedial. Sorry. Spend your money on ""The Purpose Filled Life"" instead."
2,booklover,I love Rick Warren but I don't love this book. Its tedious and remedial. I'm sorry I bought it.
1,You could do much better!,"This book covers the gist of the subject matter and in a conservative way, yet there guide will leave you wanting, so I would recommend one that covers so much more. The book I recommend educated and moved meYOUR GUIDE FOR DEFENDING THE BIBLE Self-Education of the Bible Made EasyYOUR GUIDE FOR DEFENDING THE BIBLE HAS IT ALL:* A Preface and Introduction* A section on Biblical Hermeneutics, with 11 chapters* A section on Inductive Bible Study, with 7 chapters* A section on a Book Study Program, with 4 chapters* A Section on Bible Difficulties, with 6 chapters* A section on Basics of Textual Criticism, with 4 chapters* A section on Basics of Bible Translation, with 4 chapters* A Section on Understanding Our Imperfections, with 6 chapters"
1,Its not Max Lucado,"New christian, bought everything everyone told me to buy..until the day I ran across Max Lucado....thats I will read now. Thats all I buy"
3,DON'T USE IF IN A STUDY GROUP WITH PAPERBACK USERS,"So, just started going through the book...seems good so far, BUT, I bought it for a women's study group at my church, thinking it would be easier to go back and forth with to church...I could highlight, etc. In any event, WHAT I DIDN'T consider was the fact that, while the group is going through their paper copies, flipping to page 10 or 18, or whatever, I'm struggling to figure out where they are SINCE KINDLE DOES NOT INLCLUDE THE PAGE NUMBERS that correspond with the book, thus making it almost impossible to follow along. I guess I may end up paying for both :("
3,"Bible study for the ""driven""!","I purchased this book with the hope of using it in an adult Bible study group. It may certainly be used for that purpose, but I immediately found it too intense and tedious for the average layperson, so I abandoned my original plan. In fact, even as a clergyman, I find most of the outlines Warren describes to be more than I have time for. There is nothing wrong with the (conservative) theological content of this book, but I would recommend it only to the voracious Bible student!"
5,Really great,Loveeeee this book. Rick Warren is a really good author also. I love how he goes into detail on the different ways to study the bible. It really helped me alot since I wanted to study the bible but wasn't quite sure how. Definately a great investment
5,Great tool for everyone,I had been searching for a way to teach others how to study the Bible. This book is such an incredible tool. Basic and straight forward with ample opportunity to practice each method. I can't recommend it highly enough. We are using it in our church and have a group of 25 working through it this summer and fall.
5,Every one can study the Bible,"Fantastic book by Rick Warren that will help you discover the life changing power of the Bible. You do not need a theology degree or deep knowledge of Greek and Hebrew to understand God's truth for you. The author guides you through simple steps how to read, understand, and apply the eternal principles to your current situation. Practical and fun to do."
5,Learning to study the Bible with my heart and seek His face.,This is better than my expectations. I have loved how to learn to seek God and study His Word Breathed. Great tool for praying and questions to seek answers too.
4,Loved it,Great price for what you get. The hat stood up the whole night even though it wasn't sewn completely straight. Definitely recommend it
4,Great hold,"I'd recommend these for those of you who need a really strong elastic, one that does not slip at all. I love these for the gym and running. I never have to adjust my ponytail during workouts. I wouldn't call them ""snag-free"" but they are not damaging. If you just need casual elastics to pull your back for around the house, no need to splurge on these. They are rather pricy, but you can re-use so not a bad bang for your buck."
5,"Addictive, smooth, groovy, soulful and funky but subtle","From the 2001 TIME interview, He Likes It Like That By SHEELA SARVANANDA""... an album that is part basement-funk, part hip-hop?and all slammin'grooves. ""You can smell the soul,"" he says, ""and you can feel thetemperature like hip-hop. But at the same time you can taste something like sushi.""After a few listens to the song ""Breaking Through"" from the Time to Share album which I found by accident on the net - I researched this singer and bought up as many CDs from his long and productive career as I could find. I am hooked on him. This is one of my absolute favorite cds. I particularly like ""As One"", ""Always Remain"", ""His Sugar"" but I can listen to the whole thing straight through. He feels the music with his whole body and soul - and you should check out You Tube to see him dance!"
2,"Too much message, too little Charmaine","Charmaine Clamor is a very talented singer. I first heard her on a recent NPR interview. Based on the short cuts I hear there I immediately ordered her lastest album, Flippin' Out. I love her voice and I love her styling, but I got grew tired of the heavy ""poor Philipino girl"" messages of her lyrics after just one play. It's already at the bottom of my personal play list, The CD is presently in my returns queue for my next trip to the used CD store."
2,Hope you aren't relying on this to get around...,"My husband and I used this during our trip to Maui and found that some of the information was not only inaccurate, but a lot of information about activities were left out. I don't know if Frommer's gets paid by the restaurants and businesses they listed, but some of them were horrible. After we tried a couple restaurants listed in the book and were disappointed, we stopped relying on Frommer's and just trusted our instincts and Hawaii's own local magazine guides. We also used Frommer's guidebook to San Diego last year and had forgotten how BAD it was until we got the Maui one this year. TRUST ME--this is NOT the guidebook you want to rely on for a very expensive (and worthwhile) vacation."
2,Disappointed,Dry and textbook like. I also own the 2001 edition and didn't notice any significant changes or improvements.
5,Great guidebook,This guidebook was the best investment a traveler could make. I saved so much money and found the best accommodations from a company advertised in this book. I can't recommend it enough.
3,Maui,"This book was very informative. Most information very exact.But Maui was a large disappointment. Lahaina is the city of excesses, too many wandering panhandlers who appear lost in time."
1,I would give it a -10 if i had the option,"I was very angry that this piece of garbage could be allowed to be sold under the obvious false pretenses that it is. Eminem nor his label have anything to do with this piece of crap. It was made (very poorly I might add) By some limey company from England. You can tell because all the jerks that are waiting in line are all enlgish. They even have them freestyle rap. my god English rappers? give me a break. This is a warning to any Em fan-DONT BUY THIS, DONT LOOK AT IT, JUST WALK AWAY. If em had anything to do with this it wouldnt be so crappy. YUCK!"
1,Spare yourself from this waist of time and money!!!,"This is by-far THE WORST dvd about Eminem that I've ever seen!! When I saw it in the store I tripped out because I just simply HAD to have it, I watched it the second I got home to find that all it is, is a bunch of British people talkin' about what's so good or bad about Eminem. Like who the...cares!! Sure people are intitled to their own oppinion but if you don't like him then simply just don't listen to his music or buy his stuff. Eminem even said ""My fans get me, and that's all that matters."" So who honestly cares about what someone thinks about him on the other side of the world?? All I'm sayin' is that it should be called ""Hits and Disses-What People Think Of Eminem In England"" Lets just say that it really sucks and I'm sorry I waisted my time and money on such a usless product.Signed*Eminem's #1 Fan*"
1,A WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"THIS DVD IS A WASTE OF MONEY! IT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF EMINEM ON IT, IT HAS PEOPLE WHO SAY EMINEM IS GOOD OR BAD (BORING). MY WORDS ARE: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,"Bad, Horrible, crap, eminem deserves better!!!!","eminem is hardly even in this, and most people interviewed have are not even well known people...they are his ""supposed"" friends....guys might like it though there is a random gurl taht strips in it....Its GARBAge!!! (and I LOVE EMINEM) save your money!!"
3,Grotesquely overpriced,Sam's Club sells the 24 bottle case for between $24 and $25. Even that is kind of steep for what is basically chocolate milk with some extra soy and a vitamin pill thrown in. But the online prices for this stuff are just nuts.
5,Best toy of the year!,This toy is cool! I really like it because it's more moveable than any other super-poseable toy! All of it's fingers can move and the colors are nice and the torso is more stretchy! This is the best toy ever! The best part of it is because it's more poseable than my other super-poseable toys! You already know why I rate the fun 5 stars and I rate the educational value 5 stars because it's more poseable and the durability value 5 stars because it dosen't brake easily and the overall value 5 stars because it's colors are very nice!
5,"""Doc Ock""","Hello! For those of you who look on Amazon for Lord of the Rings toys, I am the one whose name is 'Aragorn and Brego are the best'. But, this toy is cool!! It is very poseable. His fingers can fold into a fist, his two middle fingers fold back so it looks like he's shooting his web. He is the best Spiderman action figure!"
5,This toy is THE best,This is THE best spiderman toy which I own. Every single finger on his hands move except for his thumbs. I gave this toy 5 stars because when I saw how many points of articulation it had i couldn`t wait to buy it. When I got home and opened it I was amazed. Its fingers moved. You could put his hands in a Spidey-Position or any other. THIS TOY IS THE BEST FOR A TOY COLLECTOR LIKE ME.
3,It was All the Goat's Fault,Unfortunately it wasn't until the sequel that we finally discover that it was the Goat that ate all the WMDs before we could find them.
1,horrible sound when pulling out baskets,"Sturdy design. Good size for snacks or smaller items. There is no buffer or gliding mechanism. It is just metal on metal when you slide the baskets creating a HORRIBLE ""nails on chalkboard"" sound."
4,Sliding Organizer,Perfect organizer for my needs and was the exact size that I needed. I put this in my dishwasher and I did find a trace of what looks like rust afterwards. Perhaps it should not have been placed in the dishwasher...
2,Bad colors,"The colors aren't really that good so I returned these. There is no white color, the orange is almost the same as the red, and the blue is closer to the green. I think this is just a product of using cheap LEDs that are bright but not pure colors. Otherwise, the brightness and hardware quality seemed fine."
1,"Doesn't give off much light, looks flourescent","I bought these lights to place on our outdoor porch to provide ambient light during evening hours and I was very displeased. They give off very faint light and it's a strange, cold flourescent-looking light. It's not warm at all. I likely didn't realize what I was ordering, and LED light is probably supposed to be this way, but I can't imagine this making anything, including a tree, look good."
1,"A mixed bag: some interest, some goofs","Some interesting background on van Gogh's family and their religious preferences is mixed with a series of goofs in this book. The author is confused about van Gogh paintings and hasn't kept up with the better van Gogh books over the years. Better to read a more creative work, such as Meyer Shapiro's van Gogh or Jan Hulsker's The Complete van Gogh, or the two volumes of exciting insights in Walther and Metzger's van Gogh, the Complete Paintings."
5,Great book!!!!!,"It is very hard to do biographies at all. Many other authors who write about Vincent Van Gogh are usually vauge, and you can't follow through. This book is the exact opposite."
2,Bumbling repeated Ã  la Scott,"I found this book interesting, in that it sought to vindicate Scott's use of manhauling to get to the South Pole (as if the technological improvements in clothing and skis made in the 75 years since Scott's expedition wouldn't make a difference!). But what really makes the book entertaining is that, true to form, Mear and Swan bumbled their way through THEIR expedition, just like Scott did. In fact, if the US Air Force hadn't had a base at the South Pole, and hadn't been willing to fly Mear and Swan back to the coast, the authors would've DIED trying to make it back, just like Scott did, thereby proving just exactly what Mear and Snow wanted to disprove: that manhauling is an IDIOTIC venture at best!"
1,extremely disappointed,"I bought this in good faith thinking that the $30 CD was a complete package with instructions as part of the CD. I open the CD and find out that I have to spend another $23 to buy the book to understand the lessons on the CD. And since the CD is opened, I cannot return it. The description of the product is incomplete and misleading. I had no intentions of spending upwards of $60 and would have chosen a complete package for less money."
3,Separate buys- not a good way to market a book on Phonetics,"The book ' Phonetics and Phonology' by Peter Roach is a good buy for people who are serious about learning and teaching phonology. Unfortunately, the book is not sold with the CD. This firstly has a cost implication and secondly, the book is of no use without the CD and vice versa.The CD is not available on the Amazon.co.uk website. so one has to order the CD from the Amazon.com website, and is dispatched from the USA. This tends to keep customers in Europe waiting till eternity.I just hope the book and the CD are sold together at a competitive price in the future."
5,A well acted biography on the character's around the volcano,"This was an excellent movie! Some people may fall asleep to it because different things are happening at once and it's also dated, but for people who like true stories and the great outdoors will be sure to enjoy it! David Huffman's best peformance as he plays the scientist David Jackson, who explores the volcano(He was really murdered in 1985, bless his soul!). The late Art Carney does an excellent job as Harry Truman, the old man who refused to leave his home during the explosion. The ending is very sad. I love the country music score on this movie, which got me into really liking country music in the first place. Too bad they don't really make movies these days as nice as this."
1,Rubbish!,"This movie completely disrespects the people living in and among the areas of Mt St Helens. The only thing that's good about it is that you get to see the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Art Carney does a fair job of portraying the salty Harry Truman, but if this is based on a true story, why didn't they use David Johnston's real name? This film does not do justice to being there -- watching my friends' houses float down the river, having two inches of ash spread like snow all over the landscape, having to wear masks for weeks to prevent inhaling it, listening to the radio wondering if they found my sister's teacher, which they never did. We Pacific Northwesterners were all deeply affected by this experience. The least the film makers could have done was an accurate presentation of the facts ... names included."
3,Strong Language,"Purchased this DVD because of my family vaction to Mt. St. Helens. I liked the movie, but it seemed that every other word out of Art Carney was ""g** d***""."
1,awful,"I have to say that I had to throw this out!! The language in the first 5 minutes was so offensive that I just dumped it. I have no idea how the rest of the film went,but if you want a really good Mt. St. Helen's film get ""Dantes Peak"". There is not the terrible language in that one. It is also well acted."
2,Save your Money - But buy her cards!,"I really liked Doreen Virtues Card decks. I find them inspiring and helpful. I got one of her books, and found it a little dry, but also helpful. So, how could I not benefit from her CD. It is Dry. Boring. Stagnant. Slow. I found the cadance and the monotone of the reading voice so distracting that I couldn't care less what was being said.I will continue to get her cards. If there is a book I'm interested in, I would feel fine buying it. But I'm completely finished with ever attempting another CD."
4,Three Romance Angels Come to Rescue,"The meditation session is fairly short, approximately 10 minutes. Doreen will tell you to invite the romance angels to your side and communicate with them directly, telling them the status of your love life. Then you will allow the three angels to give you the gifts of three lights. The accompanying etheric music is very soothing and dreamy. I didn't feel anything special during the meditation except letting myself be wrapped in a lovely pink color and fell into a dreamy romantic fantasy while the music was playing."
1,broke,I found this tool difficult to use as it did not fit well over the trailing arm of my 97 civic ex. I got the bushing out and then while I was pressing in the new bushing the tool broke. So take care while using this tool..
4,Value,"This ring is value priced for being real silver, however it does get bent out of shape. I must be hard on rings of this nature, as it keeps getting rebent out of shape frequently. It was a good value though on a hard to find product in my ring size (10)."
5,Lovely and Sensitive,"After listening to these lovely songs, I realize all these years I have underestimated Mac Davis's songwriting and singing abilities. Both the lyrics and melodies are quite beautiful. And the nice part is that the album is not ""over-produced"" so you get to clearly hear the lyrics and acoustic guitar."
4,The Ultimate Protection but Doesn't Play Well with Others,"Part of having an iPod is having the best iPod ""toys"". ToughSkin is the Ultimate Protection against dirt and light rain(not water-proof). The skin includes clear plastic covers for the screen and wheel (flip down). The cons are you have to remove it from the skin in order to use it with other toys like iTrip, iVoice and the Bose speakers. If you are rough on your Pod, this is a must!"
4,"Good, simple protection","This skin is thick, and protects well with its extra thick bumpers. The silicone-like material feels high quality. I use it on my Ipod Photo 60GB without the spacers and it's a perfect fit. The openings on top and bottom are properly placed and centered for form and fit. It's also very easy to grip, and controls and inputs are easily accessible. It does make the Ipod a lot bigger in size, but it's the ultimate protection for a soft shell. My only gripe is that it is on the pricey side for what I'm using it for."
3,Good cover but not the best fitting.,"I bought it for the 4G iPod and found that it was still loose fitting after using the plastic spacer. It may work better for the photo. This also made it about twice as thick. It also gets stretched out around the screen from putting it on. Otherwise, it is made of a good material and looks very cool. The removeable screen and wheel protectors are also nice to have."
4,Pretty good for Ipod Photo,screen and dial protectors are great! Cute design and looks nice in clear white. Worth it
3,protects the ipod but doesn't allow me to use an iTrip,I was planning on using this in the car with an iTrip but because it is so think it doesn't allow the iTrip to plug in. If you have an iTrip I wouldn't buy it but otherwise its a good protector.
5,I learned to ask and it works!!!,"I purchased Andrew Sanderbeck's book at a book signing, not knowing how it could possibly impact my life. Wow! I found out how simple it truly is to get what you want - and if I had not read this book, I would not have realized that so quickly and easily. I have put the lessons I learned so effortlessly to work for me and have been stunned by the results. The Power of Asking is such an easy read, I completed it in a few hours. It has been added to my much read, much borrowed library for friends, who have enjoyed it as well. From reading the book, I've also learned more about Andrew Sanderbeck, and have attended speaking engagements to hear him speak. He is an extremely knowledgeable man, who spreads joy and love all around him. Read his book, hear him speak, and get to know him. I highly recommend it!"
1,Waste of time and paper,"I read less than 10 pages but concluded that at least for me, it is a complete wate of ink and time."
2,Questionalble quality,Water cooling rate difficult to control. Either too much water on blade or too little. Do not forget your ear plugs with this tool because it is loud even before the saw starts cutting the material.
2,Title Lies,"This is not the Sennheiser CX300, but rather the OEM Creative Labs EP-630 earbuds. They are inferior to the CX300 (great distortion at high frequencies and inferior bass). However, for the price these are decent ear buds that give better performance than stock earbuds that normally come with mp3 players."
5,THE BEST QUALLITY BUY NOW,"this set brings 3 different type of ear adapters and includes the ear plug type like the esure, these block out sounds perfect buy these for quality"
5,Great Seat!,I have 2 boys that are 3 and 6. I purchased 2 seats and they work well for both children. My oldest can adjust the backs to change seating all by himself. Really cool! They love them. The only thing that I would change is the backs of the seats need a lock or something because they fall apart easily if you have to move them car to car. A bit frustrating at times. Overall I am pleased with my purchase.
2,A rather tawdry and incorrect biography,"I bought this book because I'm a big fan of Betty Grable. Unfortunately, this book has many inaccurate facts and gives a tawdry view of one of most well liked and respected stars of early Hollywood. Perhaps some day someone will write an accurate biography with interviews from her family, friends and co-workers."
1,Poor guide for option trading,"This was such a disappointment. Quite clearly jumping on the wagon of self promotion in a desperate attempt to plug their web site. Every man and his dog seems to believe that by publishing a financial web site that the masses will flock to them to trade or learn their secrets.The Brock family have little credentials to join the option gurus that we all have been following for years. Stick with McMillan, Natenburg and Fontanills for guidance.These dot.com five minute wonders will soon be a thing of the past."
2,Beginners Guide to becoming a Complete Trader trading option,"This is a very, very, basic document on Options. If one wants athorough understanding of options, the CBOE has a large selection ofdocuments at no cost. They also offer seminars throughout the country also for free.The best characterization of the Book is an ""InfoMercial"" for a product they sell. Infact when you go to their Web Page, ... and subscribe using the special offer, you will receive a copy for Free."
5,Excellent guide to a complex subject,"This book is an excellent beginners guide to the complex subject of options trading. Not only is it a good introduction but it is also useful to the seasoned trader. It is very readable and the subject treatment is very ""user friendly."" I have read many books on options trading and technical indicators and, for the beginner, this book is, by far, one of the best. It combines methods of stock selecting, trading philosophy, and some of the do's and don't's of trading into a thorough package. Coupled with their website with its daily updates and links, CompleteTrader has a very comprehensive and ""complete"" package."
1,Disappointment,"Disappointed: I found the book ""The Beginner's Guide to Becoming a Complete Trader Trading Stock Options"" to be a big disappointment. Why? While the first part of the book provides a very basic definition to the most basic types of options trading, the remainder of the book was dedicated to a brief overview of some ""proprietary"" trading indicators. To utilize these ""proprietary"" indicators developed by the authors, you have to pay to become a member of the author's web site. The useful information provided by this book is available free of charge from many brokers and other sources. If you are serious about learning trading of options, this is not the guide."
3,Great product...POOR shipping,"I'm sure this would have been a great toy for the intended boy but I had to send it back because it was delivered to me completely smashed. The rest of the items in the box were fine, including the big box all the items came in...Which of course means they were placed in there ALREADY smashed. Very annoying!!!!!!! I had to take a trip to the post office to send it back!!! Next time I will go to a toy store."
2,Disappointed,This is basically a play book with very little about teaching methods and techniques. The book talks about the center pass without explaining much about it. I have read the books by Dave Cisar on single wing and this book is no comparison Cisars system is much simpler to understand and teach. Don't waste your money here like I did.
5,"A MUST-HAVE for all women, Christian or not...","I got my first copy of this book from my sister when my husband was in the hospital after being diagnosed with cancer, with the 'Treasures in the Darkness {Troubles}' section marked for me. I just bought the Kindle edition & just in time, for my slick-back copy is in tatters from being used so much. It has helped me set effective goals for my life, maintain my sanity thru my husband's cancer & my fibromyalgia, helped me help my children with tough issues, & lots, lots more!In the 5 years since I got my 1st copy, I haven't come across a problem that this book hasn't helped me with. I have also given copies to every female relative I have."
4,Another entry for the welcome reissue of compositions of Robert Saxton originally published by the now defunct Collins Classics,"This is another entry forRobert Saxton: Music to Celebrate the Resurrection; I Will Awake the Dawn; etc., and it reissues compositions of Robert Saxton originally spread out on three (even four considering the original label's reissues) published by the now defunct Collins Classics label. See my review under the other entry for more details, and links to the original Collins CDs. As I write, those original Collins discs are sold for a total price that is less than this NMC reissue (and you get Britten's Piano Concerto to boot)."
2,"Great streamers, but not so good on attaching","I bought these for my cruiser and I love them, but the plastic clips that are used to insert them into the handlebar holes don't spread well at all when you insert them. One slight tug on the streamer and they pop right out. I've removed them until I can come up with a peacemeal solution to secure them into the handlebars well so I don't lose them."
4,Not quite red,"The quality of these is nice - they are a bit of a faded, terracotta red though, not the cherry red I had hoped for. I have a couple of different reds on my bike though so they look good."
5,Wonderful Addition for Christmas Reading,"When I was growing up, beside the Biblical account of Jesus' birth, two books were read in our house every Christmas Eve: The Night Before Christmas and Santa Mouse. I think Michael Garland grew up with the same two stories.The Mouse Before Christmas feels like a loving homage to both Christmas classics. It also feels like a fresh, new tale (pun slightly intended). It is charming and sweet, lyrically perfect, and just the right length for Christmas Eve reading.Michael Garland's illustrations are also charming and sweet. His Santa Claus has the kindest eyes I've ever seen in illustration. And the world tour is stunningly beautiful.My little boy just turned four last month. This Christmas Eve, beside the Biblical account of Jesus' birth, we will be reading The Night Before Christmas, Santa Mouse AND The Mouse Before Christmas. It is good to have traditions. It is even better to make them your own."
2,Good Price but Not the Original Recordings,"This collection comes on 3 CDs and has 30 selections including a couple that I don't usually see like ""The All American Boy"". I was disappointed to find that these are not the original recordings. They are ""New Studio Recordings By The Original Artists"". I tend to prefer originality."
3,Good Data - Annoying Reminder that I'm Not Stupid,"This is a good book for reference and summary. Issues are organized with simple narrative of the rhetoric and conflicting actions taken Bush Administration.I didn't read the whole book because every section ends with, ""You're not stupid! Get the truth!"" making me feel a bit battered after only a few sections.I'll keep the book to refer to issues when I would like background."
3,So-so - confusing at times,"I had high hopes for this book after a recommendation from a friend, but I found it a difficult and confusing read. It was hard to keep some of the characters straight, and the book was really longer than it needed to be."
4,"Good read, unlikeable characters","Like all of Friedman's books, this is a wonderful piece of fiction, but I couldn't care for a single character. Actually, it seemed to me that every character either commited murder, rape, or some other atrocity, and what bothered me most was the author's flippant attitude towards such things. I thoroughly enjoy books with violent subject matter, but only when it's dealt with in some moral context--this had none. However, that one complaint aside, this is a masterful work with a supremely intricate plot, and well-written(if despicable) characters."
2,Plot too long and poorly timed,"Contrary to other ""low-score"" reviewers here, I actually did like the main characters. And the writing style is picturesque and enjoyable. My problem is with the too-long and poorly-timed plot. That and I didn't like the way the author abandoned the first main character soon after the book gets going.I must say, the first several chapters are WONDERFULLY written. I LOVED the Kindle sample, but the whole book? No, I didn't like it at all."
4,Echoes of Dune,"First off I am almost hesitant to write a review of this novel because I belive Byron 72 ""lost child""'s review is a very accurate summation of this excellent science-fiction novel. The best I can probably do is elaborate a bit more on the similarities of these two novels-(In Conquest Born & Dune). One of the most powerful similarities is the sense of history that both authors create in their novels. This sense of history and tradition is what directs the events and shapes the destiny of the two races involved-the Braxi and the Azea. The two main characters are also shaped by their histories, and Ms. Friedman uses their history to add depth and complexity to their actions. If complex, atmospheric, epoch-spanning Science-Fiction is your thing and you are a fan of the Dune novels than you definately need to give this book a try."
5,Favorite,"This is the best facial cleanser I ever bought, this is great for all ages of skin and acne prones skin."
5,A tour de force,"I loved An Uncommon Man. Adroitly written, Steve Holmes tells a story about one of the towering African-American figures of the late twentieth century. Through this biography, one remembers that the civil rights movement still has a way to go - and that some of the struggles are not that old. Moreover, one learns about - and appreciates - the human side of a gifted person who, through his great talent and hard work, rose to the apex of the American political system and had an impact on politics that continues today. Brown refused to let the color of his skin stop his progress albeit acknowledging the reality that race played. Significant detail about the history and background of Brown and his family and colleagues make this a particular joy to read. Anyone who enjoys contemporary political biographies will love this tour-de-force."
2,The Best of Naked Eyes?,"This CD is less than wonderful. I wanted ""Always Something There to Remind Me"" and ""In the Name of Love."" That's all I got because the rest of the CD does nothing for me. It isn't bad, but they aren't songs I knew already."
1,Why Pete Byrne is not Madonna,"Rob Fisher (now, sadly, deceased) wrote most of the music for Naked Eyes. The two were a real team. Fisher later went on to collaborate with other top groups and write songs. Byrne is a competent singer and now is touring with a back-up band doing the old Naked Eyes tunes.Madonna has a great album out, ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" and has been consistently recording new material for years. Naked Eyes has just been re-issuing stuff from 1983-84 for 20 years, fair enough. Byrne has a ""solo"" album called ""The Real Illusion"" with a disco cover of Paint it Black and some mediocre stuff that sounds like Barry Manilow . Why she is Madonna and people are ""just re-discovering"" Pete Byrne has to do with marketing, yes, but also effort and creativity."
1,"Did you know Promises ripped off its guitar part from David Bowie's ""Let's Dance""?","Listen to the introduction to both songs and you will see.But I guess all the 80s bands used each other's stuff. Lot's of dated, cheesy synthesizer sounds. These are good to study if you want to do a lounge act that includes the sounds of the 80s. Why people like us born in the 1980s and later want to hear this stuff when they could at least hear real rock is strange to me. It's weird how people can keep repackaging these albums to make money."
4,Excellent CD to add to Your Collection,"First of all, the intro to David Bowie's ""Lets Dance"" doesn't sound very similar to the intro in ""Promises, Promises."" Second, both songs were released in 1983, so the chance of ""Promises, Promises"" copying ""Let's Dance"" is small. Naked Eyes is the most unique and underrated musical group of the 1980's. This cd starts out with their most popular hit ""Always Something There To Remind Me,"" with it's stong synth. Other notable hits on the album are ""Promises, Promises,"" and ""No Flowers Please."" This CD keeps it coming all the way through from the beginning to the end. All in all a great cd to add to your collection."
4,Why wasn't this group any bigger! Good pop songs!,"Naked Eyes is a common case of some '80s artists that broke up or lasted one or two albums, yet put out some quality stuff. Most people know the catchy Promises Promises and Always Something There To Remind Me. I also remember What In The Name Of Love. The group gave us Simon Climie and Rob Fisher who went on to write some more pop hits for artists in the '90s and even now. Climie and Fisher's songwriting are their strongest on this one. And the other songs are just as good. I wish this group/duo was bigger than it was in 1983/1984 when they were a breakthrough act. I hope they consider a reunion tour of sorts, maybe at some small nightclubs or venues, because they were that good. Maybe go on the popular VH1 show Bands Reunited too to get more press and attention."
1,Glade Orchid Oasis Scented Oil Candle Refill 3ct,"I was terribly disappointed with the items I received. The ""Glade Orchid Oasis Scented Oil Candles"" (3 x Boxes) all arrived in terrible condition. They must have been stored in a very warm storage area for a long time, because they had no scent left in them and some of the candles had melted down and then solidified into odd shapes. On Amazon they were advertised as ""new""! Needless to say that I will never order anything from ""Empire Invest"" ever again!"
2,its ok,this season was good. I just have a question on what cds did they burn them to. I can't play this dvd on some of my dvd players.
5,"Worth it just for ""Oscar Gold""!","Another great season from another great series. American Dad just gets better with age. I think the show's creators really enjoy these characters and its shows in such episodes as ""Oscar Gold"" and ""Pulling Double Booty."" In these episodes, great personas like Jeff and Roger really get to come forward and take the show to the next level. But really, Oscar Gold is by far the number one reason to buy this latest season. Any episode with Roger as the focus is always gravy. ""Seriously Barry, you are the worst architect ever!"""
4,American Dad Vol. 4 Rocks !,"I am a American Dad fan and Vol. 4 won't let you down. One of my favorites are Oedipal Panties, it about Stan's Mom is dumped by yet another boyfriend, Francine and Roger investigate to find out why on the third date everything goes wrong. You have to see this for yourself I recommend this purchase for all American Dad fans and you can't beat the price."
1,Going Anti-Christian very fast,"Why is it that no comedy show can go a half an hour with out making fun of Jesus or Christians? American Dad started out great but now it seems they will take the road most traveled. All jokes revolve around Christians. This episode was no different. It started out really funny and I almost said ""see you do not need to bash Christians, but I interrupted by the show bashing on Christians. I have quit watching Family Guy and The Simpsons because of this. The only shows that I really like to watch any more on FOX was Futurama and it was canceled and then there was King of the Hill and it is being canceled. Oh well, after I stop watching American Dad I will stop watching FOX altogether. Which is not such a bad thing? Almost all shows on FOX are garbage anyways."
4,Oldie but goodie,Members of my family Love quirky slapstick type comedies. This is one that will probably go into the holiday collection for watching when the whole group get together/
5,A Creepy Flesheating Extravangaza!!,"In this film starring Donna Dixon and her family of flesheaters.Definitely not for vegetarians,it's a creepy flesheating extravaganza if you like horror Movies!!"
5,A Thrilling Cliff Hanger,"These days I have very little time to read. It was nice to read a book that is creatively entertaining. I found myself pleasantly transported to a new world, taking a break from this reality. Thank heavens there are new and skilled writers coming from up from the ranks. It's about time! Nice to have someone new to read."
2,Solar Mate Centurion is hit and miss,"I bought 3 of these units. The motion detection sensor is not very effective and I would classify this unit as a utility light and certainly not a security light. Of the three I bought, 1 failed within one month.Update: It would be almost impossible to NOT correctly to set up this light. This light is junk, the battery needs a good 10 hour , strong sunlit area to work. If you live in the desert, this might work for you. I even sacrificed one light to bind two of ther solar panels together trying to get enough power for the battery to be operational. Very limited improvement.Do your self a favor and pass on this product."
1,Blind as a bat - horrible product,"I bought this product a few days ago to put up in my back yard. Setup was easy and the unit appeared to work in 'test' mode by waving my hand in front of it. Left it for a couple days and tried another motion test. NOTHING!!! This unit appeared to be dead. I set the sensitivity to 'Max' and still NOTHING!! It couldn't have detected a Mac truck in my back yard. I recharged it and still nothing. I took it down in frustration and sent it back. In my experience with this product, its not worth the money and aggreviation."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I bought two of these lights. Charged them as instructed. Easy to install. After two days one unit was completely dead. I tried charging it again. It held the charge for about 1 day and then it was dead again. Contacted the company's customer service and had to buy a new battery. It still wouldn't hold a charge. Threw it in the trash. Horrible product and would not recommend. The second unit still works, but just barely and it buzzes real loud. Buy the Zenith solar unit instead!"
1,Product is not waterproof & Solar Masters does not care,"I bought two of these outdoor lights, took them by plane to my place in Chile, and put them outdoors to charge for three days before testing, as per the directions. One of them was fried before I started to use it and the other stays on constantly unless you manually turn it off due to water entering the electronics. I called the manufacturer and told them what had happened, even offering to pay for new sealed electronics units, since the light and battery and sensor portions were still fine. They refused to help me, saying that the parts were made in Malaysia and they couldn't get just the electronics module and that my warranty was expired. So, I am out $200 plus shipping charges to Chile, and now I need to buy and install another product. Everyone should know not to buy Solar Masters' products."
1,Don't last a year.,I bought six Solar Centurians to place around my garden in an attempt to keep deer from eating everything.They one by one started failing after two months. Some partially some fully.Do not but this item. It will end up in the garbage as did mine.
2,Solar Motion Sensor Security Light,"This light has not worked since the day we installed it. I have fooled around with it too many times to see if I could get it to sense an approaching auto/person. It is on my garage and should work whenever a car approachs....it worked one time when I was walking up the drive, but has not responded to anything else since. If it wasn't so much trouble I would take it down, but I cannot climb ladders and my grandson is much too busy to keep coming here to adjust it. Sorry I spent so much money on it.Shirley Dilsworth"
5,An Amazing Must Have,"This book powerfully depicts the African American's struggle to become citizens in a country that had no original intention of allowing them to do so. The photograph's in the book are captivating and show the joy, sadness fears and pain of a race of people during the most visable times of the struggle. This a great book for reference, coffee tables as well as pleasure reading."
4,Great Book Purchase,"I have been looking for this book in an affordable price range. I found it. Even though the book was described as new, it was not, however, it was in excellent condition. I could not ask for anything more.The pictures in this book represet the struggles past and present that black people have endured through history. This is a great book for both young and old."
3,A young boy travels back in time to the dawn of man.,"I read this book when I was 10 years old. As a young girl I not aquainted with Science Fiction writing but I loved the book. I brought it to class and the teacher read it everyday. The entire class truly enjoyed it. It has never appeared again on any bookshelves but now that I have a 10 year old I would like to give her the book for her birthday June 8th, 1998."
4,Great Video,"After returning to the martial arts after 20 years off, I have found that the use of videos are a great source of inspiration. Nothing can replace dojo training, however, the videos can add value to your training. This video is good for people who are looking for that extra edge. I have bought a lot of videos over the past several months and many are horrible! This one is worth the money.Word of Caution: be carful with the videos that you buy. I strongly believe that some of the reviewers are the producers of the videos they are recommending. They know that they have produced a bad video, but they will write a good review to get your money. Fortnately, this is not the case with the current video. Good look!"
5,Wow,"For something that started off as me listening to it from a game this album is beyond excellent. Many portions of it have been used in the wildly popular Grand Theft Auto III or GTA 3 for short. This album is so good that I would just turn on my Playstation 2 to listen to it and I wouldn't even be trying to play the game. The bottom line is this: even though this album is hard to find, it has soon-to-be legendary tracks and the melodies and words are enough to make you wanna move your body without even realizing why you're doing it. If you like dub, the real type of the music, then you'll LOVE this album, if you don't then click the back buttom and go buy the fake reggae that you hear on cruise ships to satisfy your listening pleasures."
4,One of the best dubs ever,"Dub is created by mixing down a multi-track recording for a second time, dropping out most of the vocal line and playing with the drums, bass and other instrumental tracks. Scientist favored the use of echo and other distortion techniques. The result strips most of the soul and integrity of an original reggae song, but leaves in its place music of ghostly, other wordly power, which can grip on a whole new emotional level. The analogy of the X-Ray has been used as a descriptor. And the idea of dub as musical caricature is cleverly portrayed in the frequent use of comics as cover art. This record, along with Black Uhuru's Dub Factor, Raiders of the Lost Dub, Augustus Pablo's ...Rockers Uptown and a handful of others, is an exemplar of the style. If you like it, you can collect enough dub to fill your record or CD shelves. It is an example of a largely lost minor-musical art form that peaked in the mid 1980s."
5,awesome,"I bought this for my husband this year for Christmas and he loves it. It fits perfect. It comes down over the ears just enough without being bulky. The logo is nice quality, he says that it is nice and warm. I think this beanie was his favorite gift to be honest and he says that he can't wait to wear it on the job site come Monday."
3,It does not fit a grown man,"Although the Chicago Bears Classic Knit Beanie was not designated for children's wear, but was with clothing for adults, it is too small from my 28-year old son who is a slender man."
5,If all protocol books were this easy to read....,"I've stated before that I appreciate the style of Radia Perlman. She tells a story, giving rich insight as to why things do what they do.This book comes close to doing the same thing, in a spirit crossed between Stevens' TCP/IP Illustrated and Perlman's writings.AppleTalk is an elegant protocol many too quickly dismiss as ""outdated."" Within it exist many working paradigms regarding utilitarian ""ease of use"" connectivity that would be of great benefit to those brainstorming where to grow TCP/IP.This book is well worth the money, and even though we've stopped developing AppleTalk stacks its constantly referenced for creative examples.The technical writers responsible for this book should be proud of themselves. Its top notch."
3,Behind the Wheel Chinese is Far Better,"Learn in Your Car Chinese is a good basic course but it has several major defects.What bothers me about the course is the obvious lack of sentence building techniques.It is not bad with vocabulary and 'canned sentence' learning.I must recommend you try Behind the Wheel Chinese in addition to or in lieu of Learn in Your Car Chinese.The presentation is far better, you learn to speak your own sentences and you get a lot more vocabulary for the money."
4,Very Effective Series,"I have used Level one for a year and Level two for six months and have found them to be excellent. The language is clear and sequential, often recycled, with ample pauses for repetition, and the compact guide book is well done, too. (I have been an ESL teacher for 28 years and speak fluent Japanese, so I know a little about language learning.) I don't know how this series would be in isolation since I study Chinese twice a week with a native speaker and focus only on conversation, as do the CDs obviously. Also, I have not tried other ""In your car"" Cds. One thing for sure, when I am going from point A to point B in my car, it is not time wasted; these CDs help me greatly to learn a difficult but important language. I am more than satisfied with my purchase and look forward to Level three."
2,"Should be subtitled ""for travel"" ...","I drive a lot, so learning or listening to things while I'm driving is very good use of my time. This series is primarily for travelers. If you want conversation, this is NOT for you! It barely covers ""hi"", ""thank you"", etc.) before it jumps into how to ask where the train station is, or which hotel, etc.The booklet may be helpful, but you are listening to this CD in your car, the booklet is useless, as it's dangerous to read and drive at the same time. So, what is the point (of it in a ""Learn In Your Car"" series)?!"
2,So-So for beginners,"I bought this CD to learn some Mandarin in hopes to be able to understand some conversation. However, it is very difficult to retain any of the vocabulary without understanding the basic of the different tones used in Mandarin. This CD is good to try and learn and memorize a set of vocabularies, but it wasn't useful for real understanding in conversation."
2,Language learning in a car...,"I was quite excited to begin learning Mandarin in my car, however, I quickly realized this technique was not one for me. If you cannot learn without some sort of visuals, then this method is also not for you. While the words were clearly stated, I had a horrible time trying to retain anything. Also, as I did not intend on traveling to China any time soon, asking for directions to the bathroom or how to change over my money seemed irrelevant."
5,Delightful,"Ted Kooser is the poet for the rest of us. Mr. Kooser shuns intellectual poetry, the kind that makes you feel you need an interpreter to understand it. His poems are down-to-earth, rooted in an intense love for the simple pleasures of life. He lives on a farm in Nebraska and his work resonates with images from this rural lifestyle. This was the first book of poetry I willfully sought out and bought since college; reading it has been pure delight."
2,I love Wonder Woman but these are not the best fit,"I really wanted Wonder woman underoos, but I was a little disappointed in the fitting and the material of this product. The Super girl set is much better in quality and true to size. The Cami top on this is HUGE and not fitted (I need to get mine taken in or return it) while the bottoms fit but feel snug because the material is not very soft. Also note the bottoms are a low-rise granny panty cut"
3,"Cute, but weird fit","It's a cute set, but the fit was all wrong. The top was too big, especially around the waist. It should either be cut differently or have more spandex. The bottoms are a little too small. Like another reviewer said, the stitching on the bottoms can be irritating on your bottom.For the price it's very cute. If your husband is a comic book geek you won't be able to keep the set on very long anyway."
1,cheaply made and horrible customer service,"Don't buy it! these undies are so cheaply, poorly cut and just bad. you can find something better at walmart! and then to make matters worse, the company wouldnt take the item back. thats the last time i do business with webundies. after receiving the product i started to think that maybe all the other feedback was left by the company itself because they are anything but sexy, cute or flattering..."
5,Great product and company,The company was great to work with. The sizing chart was very accurate and the underwear set looked as advertised. The quality of the product seems to be very good also - NOT the low quality that you usually see with the novelty underwear. The shipping was great and it came in much quicker than I thought it would during the busy holiday shipping period. I would definitely recommend this product and company to anyone.
3,"Very fun, but too big.","I think this is very fun, and was super excited to get it. It runs a little big and I thought about returning it, but decided to keep it. I wish the cami was a little longer and a little more true to size. I usually where a 8-10."
4,Love it!,"I bought a set for a friend's bachelorette party cause I thought her super nerdy fiance would love them. Then I got jealous and bought a pair for myself too.I dont wear the cami much, but the underwear is actually my favorite pair in my whole drawer. The stars are so fun and the fit is absolutely perfect. I can wear these with absolutely anything and I never have underwear lines. I am actually debating buying more sets just so I can have more of the underwear!!"
3,Meh,"First of all I expected the bottoms to be boy shorts but instead they were more of a brief cut which is fine really, it worked and looked very cute. The fit was accurate but I expected the fabric to be a bit softer."
5,OH-LA-LA,"I love this coat. Fits well, looks good and it is the most comfortable coat I have owned in a long time. Well worth the money."
1,I disagree with Simone Minichino's review,"I don't like this product at all as it is uncomfortable and unstylish, and if Simone is going to buy one for herself, it should be a straitjacket!"
1,Would never sell for $100,"Unfortunately, I bought two very similar jackets here on Amazon.To be honest, I was enticed by the thought of owning a $100 jacket for $19.95. Unfortunately, jackets of this quality are available at Wal-Mart for less than $20.00 and I passed on them.I don't find this jacket to be very well designed. To protect against rain, you had better be sure and keep the hood on tight. Otherwise, the fuzzy fabric lining the hood gets drenched. But put the hood on and your hair is going to stand on end for the rest of the day because of the static the lining creates. Leave the hood off and it looks pretty unflattering as it doesn't hang neatly against your back. Wish I had passed on this one.Also, both jackets run a bit small. On this one, I didn't realize the the cuff rolled up to expose the fuzzy lining - not a look I'm fond of and it exposes the lining to moisture. No flap behind the zipper to protect against wind."
4,A good basic source,"This is an excellent book for those newly interested in Pablo Picasso. It has a thorough history of his life, and a solid sampling of his artwork, not just the most famous examples. The writing style is somewhat informal, which can be good or bad, depending on your tastes. Also, it is a very compact size (about the size and shape of a CD) so it's wonderfully portable, but also pretty short."
2,Useful only for basic level learners,"During my first military exercise with the Thai army in 1993 I made the mistake of bringing this book to the jungle as my sole Eng-Thai resource. It was issued by my unit and it was compact enough. However, mere hours into the job it became painfully obvious that the amount of vocabulary listed was so limited as to not be of much use as a reliable resource for advanced-level translating/interpreting. I do recall, however, that the people who spoke Thai at the basic/beginner level seemed quite happy with the dictionary's content. Therefore, I would only recommend this dictionary for someone who intends to visit Thailand briefly and does not intend to pursue Thai language study beyond the beginner level. I would even submit that if one can wait until one arrives in-country, there are many similarly priced pocket dictionaries in bookstores all over Thailand that are much more comprehensive in content."
3,mixed feelings,"The dictionary is more comprehensive than some of the beginning dictionaries I've seen, but there are a lot of tone mistakes. That's my biggest gripe."
3,A good idea but out of date,"This was the first dictionary I used when I moved to Thailand in 1997. It has one very big plus - Thai words are spelled (and alphabeticzed) using Roman letters, which makes it far more useful in conversation. So if I need to say ""where"", when I look it up it says ""tee-nai"", not a bunch of Thai characters. It's even better when hearing a Thai word and having no idea how to spell it in Thai. In this case, ""tee-nai"" is under ""T"". This feature makes it worth buying.However, it has far too few words, and is badly out of date. The last (only?) edition was in 1969, and includes now-irrelevat words like ""Communist terrorist"".The binding is also poor; you can expect to be holding it together with a rubber band within a few months."
1,The weakest book in this category,"This is a disorganized collection of common sense suggestions that you would figure out on your first camping trip. I would think it might be of value to reduce the anxiety of someone who had never gone out in an RV before, but its treatment of the subject matter is about as deep as a Reader's Digest vignette. I have nearly every title in this category (except the Dummies book) and this one is my only disappointment."
5,A most helpful and entertaining book to read,This book will be has been most helpful to us. We are keeping this book near us while we prepare to take our first trip as part time rvers. Some of the shopping tips have already saved space both in our trailer and in our small apartment. People who live in small places would be well to buy this book. Thank you
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this book 3 years ago right after we bought a motorhome. Now that I have become a seasoned RV'er, I can tell you that this book is extremely outdated (published in 1999) and simply one woman's personal opinions. Almost everything in this book is common sense and recollections of what she and her husband did traveling in their 5th wheel and truck. Save your money and put it toward a subscription to Motorhome Magazine or Trailer Life. You will get up-to-date and accurate information there."
1,Save your money,This Book is horrible. The only point of the Unknowable is to prove that Chaitin is as smart as Godel and Turing. The entire book can also be retrived off his homepage. If you want to have a good overview of this topic buy Limits of Mathematics by Chaitin.
4,Excelent product,"The blu-ray complete first season of Game of Thrones brings what the fan expected. Great video and sound quality and a good variety of extras.If a complain must be done, it is only on the organization of the information. There is a single menu for all the blu-rays, which is a great idea, but you don't know what exactly is in each of the blu-rays. So, if you put the blu-ray n. 1 and asks to see the 4th episode, you will have to change the discs, which means the menu will have to load all again. Better would be if the content of each disc was highlighted in the menu, so that the user could identify all he/she could see without needing to change discs.Except for that, recommend the product and keep waiting for the second season!"
5,Fabulous adaptation to the books.,"This was the best show I have watched that was taken from an excellent series of books I was not expecting it to be this good, the casting was great and it followed the books marvelously I love these type of films and books so needless to say I was very impressed."
2,Its the Menu silly...,"The whole series and content is fabulous, no complaints there its a 9.5 star show. But who ever created the Menu for this boxset should be FIRED immediately. Worse navigating menu I have ever come across. Viewer should be able to see whats available on the disc not be told after selection load a different disc.....and the loading times, especially the first disc. Look I dont write this review to put you off, you must get the series as I wrote content is fantastic. Am just writing to make you aware as many others have done to be prepared for difficult navigation through the discs. Being aware is forearmed.PS. Boxset is Region Free."
5,atp,"gripping storyline and beautifully executed with sunning intriguing visuals,loved the first 5episodes cant wait to see the whole season and more!"
4,Intriguing fantasy,"A few people mentioned this series to my wife and I. When we finally watched the first episode we were hooked. It's artistic, sexy and full of adventure as well as mystery. I would compare it with Lord of the Rings crossed with True Blood."
5,It's Game of Thrones,I don't even know why anyone would have to write a review for this. Game of Thrones is by far one of the best shows out there right now.
3,Mesmerizing - Most of the Time,"A captivating story. Spectacular scenary. Superb casting. First rate actors and acting. I was immersed in Westeros in minutes and could have watched for hours. But about the time I was convinced this was a new epic adventure, HBO reminds me with a regular gratuitous sex scene that never mind, it is just a made for TV movie after all. A waste of good actors flopping, slurping, and moaning through one more round of soft porn about once every 40 minutes. About like if George R. R. Martin inserted such a diversion every 10 pages. C'mon HBO, that is a stale, old, formula. Do Better."
2,Probable 1st & last digital series purchase,I love the show and easily give it four stars. My problem is that the digital version does not appear to have the same special features as the DVD version. This is something I care very much about so I cannot recommend this version of a fine television series.
4,"Great, but happened so fast","THis show was amazing and held true to the book. The only thing that I kept asking myself was....""this seems to be happening to fast"" I guess thats bound to happen when the try to fit 1000+ page book into 10 one hour long episodes...The show was amazing...just wish it broke down the book into more episodes"
2,Doesn't work on OPPO BDP-83,"Does not work at all on OPPO BDP-83 with the latest firmware version installed. CAREFUL!!!! IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE IN AN OPPO BDP-83, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT INSTALL THE LATEST FIRMWARE!!! Second part: after some tests, I could manage to make it work. Not perfect, but at least the disc loads. I added a USB stick to the back of the OPPO and it did the magic. Seems the internal persistant memory of the OPPO is not enough to load the menues of Games of Thrones. However, I think that HBO did a very bad work here with these Bluray discs. The time it takes to load, the flaws in the menues, the freezings it produces in the player, makes me believe that the programmers who coded the Java portions of the BD were either drunk or trying to reinvent the wheel getting out of codings standards completely. HBO should test a little bit best their products before putting them in the market... I am downgrading the rate to 2 stars due to this HBO lack of professionalism."
3,Amazon needs to get app so streaming can be watched on tablets!,"I love the show...just disappointed that Amazon hasn't yet made it so their streaming items can be watched on Tablets. Netflix does it! Just much more convenient to watch on tablet, than lug my PC around on the train or to bed to watch my shows..."
5,As Good as the Book,"Let me tell you that this first adaptation to the A Song of Ice And Fire series is a really good one. Somethings may have been changed, or may be they are not as you picture them when you read it, but that's what happens with any adaptation."
3,Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season,"I am now reading book 5. I do not subscribe to HBO. The best thing I can say about the series is that I can picture the characters; although, as a long time reader, my mind has always been good at visualization. The sound was not all that great - background sounds over-powered the dialogue."
3,"it's HBO, it must be soft porn for the brain","Typical HBO, take a good story and throw in as much sex and naked bodies as you can without getting thrown to a regular porn channel. My co-worker kept telling me what a good show it was and I read the reviews on amazon which were much more frank in nature with the Tudor series.I can live with the gory battle scenes but I found the naked bodies and various sexual positions/genders distracting for what is otherwise a visually stunning and well written series.I will not be buying this series because there is no point if I can't share a show with my children. Pity, good shows are hard to come by. Network television is over run by reality shows featuring people I have no desire to know anything about."
5,Excellent show!,"My wife and I greatly enjoyed this show, such great stories, such great actors! There is such a depth of story, tha the world comes alive, now I can't wait to read the books!"
5,Great representation of the books,HBO did a great job of representing the raw emotion and excitement that I got out of reading the books.Read the books first because it can be hard to follow otherwise.Only minor changes from the books.
3,Well done but....,The first season is good and look forward to the second. The acting is good and special effects are good. The reason for the 3 stars is that the sex scene and the abundance of blood were totally unnecesary. Many of the scenes can be classified as porn. So be aware this is not for children which is to bad.
5,GAME OF THRONES,Very impressed with the delivery time. Ten days from order to arrival in South Australia. The quality of the boxed set is fantastic and everything arrived intact. The actual production is extraordinary. The opening scenes blew me away and I had no choice but to set aside a couple of days so that I was swept away and transported into another realm.This is an amazing series and I can hardly wait for the next season to come out on Bluray. There's no doubt I will be ordering it when it is released.Thanks once again Amazon for providing a great service.
5,Game of Thrones BRD,The series is awesome and illicits a wide range of emotional responses. The package arrived safely and complete with no damage.
5,Nice box-set,"Not much to say in a review! As a box set goes, it is just that! What more could you want?The series itself is impressive. I did not see it originally aired, and I zipped through the episodes. I plan on getting season 2 which it is released, and will probably re-watch season 1 before I start 2, to catch up and see ""what I missed"" not that I see the full story. I also got the books (on CD) to learn more of the story and see how close the show is to the books (I am told they did well, all things considered)."
5,very good intro,"The great beginning. Even my husband, who hasn't read the books, enjoyed the hbo episode. I can't wait to purchase the blue rays."
5,Awesome,"I've got nothing to complain about. The cover is gorgeous, the commentary is great. I suppose some more features like deleted scenes would have been nice."
4,Worth having in your collection,"After reading the books, was happy to see the HBO series available on DVD. Ordered the set and was not disappointed. The producers kept the tone of the books and I think improved the tempo. The first episode had lots of blood and bare bottoms, but that may have been a ""hook"". They seemed to glorify it less as the series matured. Very enjoyable for the mature viewer."
4,The Godfather of Medievil Fantasy,"If the Mafia was around at during the 12th century, this is what it might have been. This is as entertaining as the Corleone family dealings, but will anyone survive to become the Don of this kingdome? I really enjoyed this series, but I could have done without seeing someone cut off their horse's head. Go ahead, you'll get hooked - don't lose your head."
4,Richie M,"I bought this item as a gift, so I really don't know much about it. But the person who received it was certainly thrilled!"
4,In Den's opinion,"I've read the first several books and enjoyed them immensely. When I started watching the series on my computer to catch up on HBO's version, I was astonished at how true to the books it was.Keep it up HBO an Amazon."
3,Defective,"Although I love this series and have gone on to watch season 2, one of the DVDs I bought through Amazon was defective. It skipped a huge part of both episodes that were on it from the first time I watched it. Unfortunate and annoying, but I figured I'd just return it and get a nondefective one, right? Except for the fact that it's now discontinued. So what I'm assuming is usually a great product, I guess I got a bad batch and now can't do anything about it =("
5,Fantastic!,"This was a great buy. It is in perfect condition with all the extra leaflets in the box. Very good quality and worth every cent,"
5,doesn't get any better,great price on an amazing format of an incredible show. I bought a copy for myself and gifted one to my sister.
1,Loved it UNTIL...,"...stupid HBO had to go and pull some politically correct, liberal Hollywood B.S. and add some made-up gay romance scene between Renly and Loras Tyrell. It's one thing if it is ACTUALLY a scene from the book, but when you just throw it in there to push your gay agenda then you've lost all your credibility. Yeah, there are rumors about those characters being gay, but that's all they are, rumors. That scene wasn't in the book and it shouldn't have been in the show. I was considering buying this blu-ray, but not anymore. You lost business today HBO. Pathetic."
4,Excited for more,"The very first episode is what caught my attention. We get a glimpse of some scary creatures and dead that come back to life, so i was really excited to see what happened next. After episode 1 however, we never see the creatures again. Oh their talked about, a lot, but that's it, just talk. Don't get me wrong i really liked the show, it kept my attention. 2 of my favorite characters die so I'm bummed that i won't be seeing them in season 2. I'm interested in finding out more about Kalhesi and the dragons though. Overall it's a great show"
1,"So much potential, but bitterly disappointing","I'm a huge fan of fantasy and scifi, and I've heard so much hype about the Game of Thrones series, that I was ecstatic to see it available on-demand from Amazon Prime. I ponied up the extra buck to watch it in HD, sat back, and prepared to be amazed. Well, I guess I was amazed, but not in the way I expected. This episode falls amazingly short of its potential. There are plenty of elements to grab and hold attention: characters facing tough choices, boys coming of age, a young girl more suited for combat than cross-stitching, mysterious and outrageously evil enemies, etc... I mean, sure those are old stand-bys, and maybe a bit trite, but they work. Production and casting are also quite good. But things quickly go from promising to pathetic. Gratuitous nudity, coarse sexual content, scenes demeaning to women, and foul language, all of which turn my first (and last) episode into a real dirt sandwich. Wish I had my money and time back. Not recommended."
2,Way Overrated,"I'm not much into this fantasy lord of the rings crap , but when I saw the first episode I was pleasantly surprised especially when they show the creatures in the forest , but after that it just mainly became a snoozefest , who are these fanboys who get caught up with these storylines if they want to make a lord of the rings then go all the way and make it fantastical with creatures and monsters and magic and stuff like that , not just a bunch of people yapping about make believe , some episodes were just boring as hell , they say war is coming for the second season , I sure hope so"
2,"Great story, terrible adaptation","I've read the books, and mostly like the story as it unfolds with great depth and detail. I couldn't wait to watch it brought to visual life, and was hoping it would be adapted as well as Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. But I've watched a couple of episodes, and I just don't like it. Confusing direction, uninspiring acting, with only tiny glimmers of the strength of GRRM's writing coming through. I suspect it would be difficult for an intelligent viewer to understand (or care about) the paper-thin characters portrayed in these videos without having read the books. There's a really good story in the books, buy those instead."
1,hate the instant video,"The show is great- some of the best TV I have ever seen- but I have had nothing but trouble with streaming the video. It works on one laptop, but not the other- why not? It is a mystery. I spent a long time chatting with a super helpful Amazon employee, but we still couldn't figure out what was wrong. and if my internet is down- too bad, no video. Buy the dvds instead."
2,"Excessively violent and gory, story goes nowhere","I was excited to watch this program after so much critical acclaim for it. I found it to be exceedingly violent and gory, which adds absolutely nothing to the plot. The acting seems quite good, but the plot really goes nowhere in the first five episodes, which is all I could stomach. Really do you want to spend 10 hours of your free time absorbing all this negativity and violence into your soul?"
5,"Love it, I'm hooked!","This is an incredible story and an amazing production. If you like the genre and can take some violence, you will appreciate a great series for adults and enjoy the ride. I can't wait for season 2 to be available!"
5,Game of Thrones Season One DVD set,"Great series! Can not wait for Season Two! And, Season Three....Hopefully there will be a Season for all the books......."
5,Love this series- when's Season 2 coming out???!!!,"Read all the books and love them all. Season 1 reflects it very closely. Keep having marathon Game of Throne nights, so not getting much sleep!"
5,Incredible!,This series was just amazing. I went into it unsure of what to expect but after being told to watch it by so many people I decided to buy it. This is one my new favorite shows.
3,Good story but very graphic,"I love these books and Sean Bean so I couldn't wait to watch this show. I like the whole story but it is a bit too graphic for me, and certainly not appropriate for kids."
5,game of thrones,"absolutely genius.......sean bean carries the weight as the patriarch of the stark family....every episode is beautiful and spell binding..thank you hbo...great epic movies rome, tudors, games of thrones. Just brilliant!!!well done guys"
4,Good.,"This is a good show. It has a good story, good characters, a good beginning, a good middle, and a good ending. The producers did a good job. The actors are good. So if you're a good person with good tastes, then this is the show for you. But you don't have to take my word for it.Good day!=)"
3,Loved it until the end,"I really enjoyed the story line. The characters are awesome and it's as delicious as you'd expect from HBO. But I'll be honest...the finale was a real disappointment. I really wanted to see Ned return in the second season to destroy the Lanister empire. To loose the most central character of the entire season (and symbol of hope) was disappointing. And I loved Khal.Perhaps HBO did too great of a job in the writing, because I got so enthralled. And of course I'm writing from the female perspective. And had the season ended the way I'd hope, maybe it would've come off a little cliched. But I have a feeling I'm speaking for many other female audience members here. I would've eagerly purchased the second season to watch Ned and Khal kick butt."
3,Great... once you get it working,"The shows were wonderful, and the viewing quailty is fantastic - but we had several issues with the DVDs working correctly. They would take forever to load up, and occasionally not load. Sometimes they said there was a copyright issue. Also you can sometimes ""choose"" the next episode, but you'd have to switch discs. Because they take so long to load, that was a 10 minutes process. So glad we got to watch the 1st season, but getting it to run was a hassel."
5,Game of Thrones,If you haven't watched this series. I seriously recommend just buying this one. Season two just came out. I'm getting it asap.
3,Not so Collectible,"The blu ray packaging was niceThe episodes should be goodI would have given this 5 Stars if it was worth it to pay more for this edition and its not worth it.The collectible dragon egg paperweight was half finished junk and looked like a preschooler made itYou do get episode one of next seasonI probably won't pay any extra money for next season to get a ""collectible"" edition"
1,"game of thrones, season 1",total shit! what a complete waste of money. whoever wrote the script is a complete moron. I put the whole F-ing thing in my grill and burnt it. total crap!!! I'd give it a -10 but it won't let me.
1,unfair review or my opinion,"since season 2 just debuted on hbo recently me and girlfriend decided to start watching season 1.we both have varying opinions on movie selections she leans more to romantic comedies and I tend to watch asian crime drama.we both did not like this show. we thought it was slow, all of the characters are not interesting I don't care for their personal stories or the main plot/story.to be fair, i must say we decided to stop watching after episode 5 in a 10 episode season."
1,Porn and lots of it,"I read these books and they are definitely not for children. I however was disappointed that in the way that HBO took every opportunity to show nudity, sex, and more nudity and sex. I never considered myself prudish, but this was just too much for me.Needless to say I'm disappointed that HBO took the series and chose to cross the lines of decency, but that is to be expected I suppose.Just my opinion."
1,instant streaming videos,"My initial experience was reasonable. It worked with my older flash drive version.This most recent experience sucks. I own the video, I uninstalled the older version andinstalled the most recent.The video will not stream. It keeps telling me to update my flash drive. Geesh!!What the heck!!! I want to buy another episode, but I am reluctant for obvious reasons.goguddy"
1,Rip off,$28 for 13 episodes which come instant? This is a complete rip off! It's sad that you have to pay that or $2.99 per episode and not even own the hardcopy of a DVD.
4,Brings the book to life,"Seems to be following the book reasonably well at least enough to make watching the shows enjoyable. Some of the actors do not match my vision of them especially Daenerys and Tyrion (although the actor is very good) but I am adjusting...Jon Snow, not sure what my expectation was but he is growing on me. The books are so huge & complex, it is amazing that they can put them into a TV format. Over all, I am glad to have the CD's since I don't have HBO."
5,the game of thrones,i bought this television series episode by episode. i wish i bought the hard copy so i could sell it after watching it a few times. i enjoyed this series a lot and highly recommend it.
4,"Great set, DVD navigation is HORRIBLE!","I loved watching the Game of Thrones on HBO. I think it is a great series, excellent production values, and great acting. Definitely worth a watch, especially on a format where you can instantly re-watch an episode. A lot of the inner plot points (and character names) are hard to figure out on first watch. The menu navigation is HORRIBLE. First, why would you need 5 discs for 10 hours of show? Even with another 10 hours of extra features (which there isn't) you wouldn't need 5 discs..the startup time takes forever. No wonder people find alternative ways to watch things."
5,You need to watch this series,"I had been looking for a new series to get into, and boy have I found one. One of my co-workers suggested Game of Thrones. I watched Season 1 on HBO and went out and bought books 1-4....still waiting on book 5 in paperback. I just had to have this on Blue-Ray. Please help support this series, you won't regret it."
5,Good Stuff,Great story and the players are divine. My husband and I both enjoy the theme and the story development...can't wait until next season is released. Highly recommended.
4,Game of thrones,Ordered this for my mom for mothers day as she loved the hob series. She and my brother said it was awesome and they cannot wait for season 2 to be released.
5,Buy this!!!,"I loved the books and was prepared to be disappointed in the tv series, but OMG!!! Peter Dinklage totally blew me away with his preformance as Tyrion Lannister. He may be small in stature, but he is an absolute giant as as actor. He carried this series for me. I cannot wait to get the next season. Whatever else you may think of the way this was brought to the screen, it is completely worth it just to see this man act. I haven't been this impressed with anyone since I saw Al Pacino's Merchant of Venice. Peter Dinklage is magnificent."
2,Disappointing,"I was so looking forward to seeing this, I've read all the books and loved them. The director of this series has thrown way too many naked boobs in this and no real passion to any of the sex. The acting is good though as are the costumes and sets. I will probably watch one more installment to see if makes a difference, but all and all, I think HBO could have found someone else to direct this."
4,Too Racey,"I enjoyed the story line, but was not prepared for the ""X"" rated scenes (seriously, I'm not just being a prude). Should have done a little more research before purchasing. It is definitely not for children! Parents use caution. Sadly, the story would have been just as good without all the nudity and sex. It's a good enough mid evil flick if you like the genre, but be prepared, many of you will be offended and shocked by the adult scenes."
3,has a problem with disc 1,"Unfortunately I did not catch this until after the warranty was complete. The rest of the discs are just fine, but would be nice to have a replacement for Disc 1"
4,WARNING,"The game of thrones is great series. Loved the books, the HBO series is well done, but a warning to viewers. The content of the series is very adult. I do not recommend that you watch this with children. The sexual content is very graphic and total body nudity ( predominantly of women) is frequent and repetitive. Sometimes pretty overdone. Other than that, a captivating story."
4,L0ve the political intrigue,Thought the series was good because of political Intrigue and action. A bit too much cursing and nudity for my taste.
4,One of the best TV series of 2011,A King Arthur style TV series with great a cast and complimentary acting. Season 1 ending only encouraged waiting to see the next season to come.
3,"Good show obviously, but some bad handling","I think the information sleeve was missing inside, and there were some bends in the DVD set. Somebody definitely tampered with it. Come on amazon!"
2,Missing parts,"This edition was missing the family tree insert, which my daughter really wanted. The holder was there, but empty. This is a rating on the packaging, only."
3,Great packaging. but $100? Really?,"This is basically the first-season set in a fancy box with a 4"" plastic dragon-egg paperweight for $100 list price.The only other bonus is a DVD with the first episode of Season 2. That doesn't even make any sense. What is the point in that?I think the correct price point for this set would be about $60. This sad ""collectors edition"" is just another attempt by the studios to make money off the fans."
4,well Done,A fantastic adventure that follows the story well. The casting is fantastic.This show helps me get over my longing forDeadwood.
5,Awesome Show,"I had been contemplating reading the books...I typically like this genre anyways...when I saw that Game of Thrones was out on DVD...I had a feeling this was going to be good especially with Sean Bean as the major character in Season One. I rented the first two espisodes and then I bought the DVD. It was pretty easy to pick up what was going on even though I did not read the book. I usually like to read the books first...I do think I am going to buy the book. I have to say...this show is not for children or as someone else said ""not for the faint of heart"" as it is extremely violent. However, having said that...the storyline and the characters are great...I love the show...watched it twice and I am looking forward to Seaason Two."
5,WOW - WELL DONE - A RARE TREAT,"I have read four of the novels so far and enjoyed them. I was curious as to how this epic could be converted to a film considering the wealth of characters and numerous subplots. As I do not get HBO I invested in the DVD set and was not disappointed one iota. The casting was marvelous - the cinematography is superb - and it is actually easier to follow than the book. I am usually disappointed when books are made into video presentations, be it in theaters or on TV. I can honestly say it is marvelous in it's scope and delivery. Yes, it is gory and there is frequent nudity and sexuality but it is not done tastelessly. To me it was excellent start to finish and I can not wait to see the second season. The set is well worth the price and I hope to be able to continue purchasing the series. It will be interesting to see how many books they end up doing. Hopefully, there will not be a six year wait as there was between several of the books."
4,very medieval,"this series is very true to the books, and incredibly well done. the acting is superb as well as the set and costume design. it feels more like a full length film then just tv. the only thing i dislike about the series is the gratuitous nudity and sex. i'm all for a love scene but watching 2 girls finger each other is a bit more like porn to me than a movie. if the sex can be overlooked i would recommend this to anyone interested in the medieval."
5,Awesome,Can't wait for season 2 to come out! Probably going to watch the season again before next season comes out.
4,great adaptation,"This was a great adaptation of the books, and a fantastic show in its own right. I got completely lost in the story and the characters, EXCEPT in a couple of spots. Don't get me wrong, I like boobs as much as the next guy, but eventually the nudity in this show started seeming perfunctory. It's like you could hear the producer in the background saying to the writer ""Yes, yes, good show, but our fans need to see a little bit of tit in every episode. Where can you squeeze it in here?""Especially the scenes where Littlefinger is training whores in how to fake an orgasm. Yeah, I get that it reveals some attributes of his character, but it was still felt somehow fake, and broke the immersion. Ironically, that's exactly what Littlefinger was telling the whores about their sex technique."
1,Pointless violence,They are trying to create this world where the value of human life is very low and they revel debasing it and ending it in depraved ways. I think the creators of this show being socially irresponsible. Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
3,Naked!,"Excellent acting. Excellent plot/s also. Why so much nudity? The story can still be well-told without the people with their clothes off! Surprises, always good, and great scenery. It's a shame that Sean Bean left so quickly. His acting was superb. The whole seven kingdom scenario works very well and makes for lots of competition/honor upheld/intermarriage. There could be more decent TV shows, well-written and well-acted, on regular channels, sans the nudity. Most of regular TV is garbage. Thanks to HBO for producing this series and doing it so beautifully.Laura Watson"
2,Lost,"Great ideas, great characters, wonderful setting, excellentacting all leading to amazing disappointment at storyline.I have no problem losing a main character if, IF it is worthit. Losing a main character gratuitously feels like I'm beingcheated by the author. In this case the character you aremost invested in is so purblind as to be an outright idiotin the end. How he became the head of one of the sevenkingdoms is beyond the storytelling abilities presented here.Unless you are willing to suspend belief at the level of ananimated Disney movie, I would beware of starting this one."
5,anxiously awaiting more,I enjoyed watching the series tremendously and cannot wait to see season 2. I anxiously await to be able video stream Season 2 on Amazon
5,Must have for your action collection,"Very excited to get the Game of Thrones, First Season on DVD. We love the show and would recommend this series to anyone who loves action and adventure! Great purchase!"
5,Awesome BluRay experience,This is a great example of adapting a book for TV. The quality of the series is a 10 of 10. The extras on the DVDs are interesting and fun to watch.
5,Obsessed,"I have not read the series of books, however, the gnome series is nothing short of amazing. I love the story line, and I love how well each character is developed, albeit there are a ton of them! Bought the first season last wk and finished it within two days, and I like it so much that I ordered hbo so that I could tune in to watch the season 2. I can't wait to pick up where first season left off!!! If you are an adult who likes a complex but powerful storyline this is for you. But I will say, I was not prepared for all the sexuality in the series, so that may be something to look out for."
5,Great series!,"What a great show! Well done, really brings the books to life. Looking forward to season 2! Just don't get attached to any characters ..."
4,GOT,"I was excited to have the opportunity to view the 1st season series of a novel I had just completed, having accidentallystumbled upon the novel itself. The TV program was as advertised and provided a unique perspective of the story I had spent a great deal of effort trying to understand with the varied characters of peculiar name and commonly revised story lines. Dollar for dollar, I found the DVD series to be of good value."
5,Love It! Love It! Love It!,Can't wait until Season 2 comes out! The characters (especially Lord Eddard Stark) sweep you up into the story from the opening scene. Brilliant writing...cinematography perfection.
5,Worked Great,No problems with streaming at all! I would definately use this service again. Picture Quality was very good and love that I can purchase individual episodes.
3,"good series, not so good streaming","Though I have enjoyed the series, I am not impressed with the video quality of standard streaming. I know it's not HD, but I didn't expect some of the graininess and blur."
3,Some Good Some Bad,"I almost didn't watch this because of the over-the-top violence and sex. I don't know why HBO thinks that entertainment MUST include graphic sex and blood. Once I got past that, I started to enjoy the story. It's not the most compelling thing I've watched, but the cast is good. The scenery and settings are visually stunning. The blend of fantasy with something that looks like history is also interesting. The people, places and cultures look like they could exist, so the believability factor was pretty good too. Most of the players are despicable, so it's hard to like anybody, but the dwarf was definitely the most colorful character. If you have nothing else to watch, I'd give it a go.P.S. I haven't read the book."
5,The Discs Hesitate a Little,I LOVE this show and am a little disappointed that some of the blu ray disks hesitate a little bit. Is there any way to remedy this?
4,Good But Was Expecting More,I hear what all the critics were saying about this being a good series. The cinematography alone is insane for an HBO series. The casting is excellent and the acting is good too. The are 2-3 to good story lines in the first season but the other story lines are marginal and left me wanting/expecting more. I heard so many good things about this series that maybe my expectations were too high. You need to really pay attention to the plots as there are 7 different thrones and too many different and confusing character names to remember. If it were not for the nudity/ sexual scenes in the first few episodes I would of given this a 3 star rating. Gotta love those brothels in the medieval times!
5,The next Lord of the Rings,"Amazing. I bought this first season completely blind. Having only seen the trailer and the (very!) low new release price decided to buy it. This is by far the best $30 I've ever spent. Not only does it look incredible on blu ray but the Box set is the highest quality I have ever seen put out by HBO. Not to mention the Story. I dont want to include any spoilers so i wont say much but ""Winter is coming"" and I am very anxiously waiting the start of season 2 premiering April 1st."
5,Great,Follows the books really well! One of the few tv/movies that I have seen that has done so! The bonus on that is it is much easier to follow than the books and has made them easier for me to understand.
1,"Loud, grotty and nasty","After many, many comments on my last review which had to be deleted because of the inane, rude and downright filthy comments made by people who can't tolerate opposing views, I have seen 6 of the episodes, suffering through all just in case somebody told me I didn't know what I was talking about. I still think that it is an overblown and waffling series. How anybody can say that this story is a masterpiece is beyond me. So to all GOT addicts who disagree with me have at it with the comments, it will not change what I think is a nasty, seedy and altogether ordinary series."
5,An Intense Medieval Drama,"From the first time I watched the opening cinematic I was enraptured. When going into this I was expecting something that involved more sword fights and bravado than thought with some intense action. While it is intense, the action involves words, not swords. I honestly never thought that I could enjoy watching people talk to each other so much.It was about halfway through that I realized I was watching a dreaded 'soap opera', and I loved it.If you like compelling characters with complex relations between one another, political intrigue, medieval fantasy, legitimately (but easily spoiled) twists all rolled into a single masterpiece...Then what is there more to say. Watch it You dolt."
1,So disappointed!,"l bought this for my parents as a Xmas present. I was so disappointed to find that the could not watch past the first 10 minutes of the first episode even though it was brand new because it was so badly scratched. Needless to say, this is the first and last blu-ray I am ever purchasing from Amazon, ever."
1,Does it even work?,I've been fighting the blu-rays for over two hours... I won't even load a title screen. Updated by blu-ray driver just before inserting the discs and nothing happens. Takes about 20 minutes to get to a black screen with a menu at the top. Drop to the Episodes and they won't load. What a piece of junk.
1,Unhappy with your movie delivery system!!!!!!,"Your movies are still coming unstable, randomly blurry, with many stops. I am happy with Amazon but very unhappy with your movie delivery system. I think you guys have a way to go in compare to Netflix."
5,This is a very entertainig show,I have really enjoyed this show. It is very entertaining. The characters are very good at acting out their part. There are many twist and turns and that make it a very exciting show. I think it is not suitable for young children due to the sexual language and nudity. Otherwise I would recommend it very much.
4,Worth the watch.,Fantasy plot line that blends medieval setting with politics and good versus evil. Good acting. It has an interesting story line with no major twists (as yet). If you like intrigue you will like this. Would be 'R' or âXâ rated if it were a movie. Contains sex and violence. Series is not done yet. Season three is now being created. Books were good too.
5,Amazing series,Game of thrones amazing series bought this set for an awesome price 40 dollars can't get any better recommend to all!
3,"Fantastic show, but...","While I absolutely LOVE the show itself, the way this is packaged leaves a LOT to be desired. It seems HBO now does the combo packs in such a way that it's nearly impossible to get a completely pristine DVD. The blu-ray discs are fine, but the DVDs are basically shoved into a cardboard envelope that makes them entirely too easy to be scratched. I went through two of these, and still haven't gotten one with scratch-free DVDs yet. Amazon has been doing their best to help, but HBO really needs to do this better. My wife bought season 1 of ""Girls"" and had the exact same issue."
5,A new and wonderful addiction,I was a little shocked about how addictive this show is. I have recommended it to at least everyone at work and my family and they all love it. Ages ranging from 20 to 70.
4,Great Show,"This is an excellent show. Rather a lot of violence and nudity, but for all that the plot is thick, the drama exciting, and the characters convincing. The quality of this video is relatively high."
5,Great,"Love this series, every episode is great to watch. Great series from HBO. Can't wait for season two to come out."
5,LOVE...and I'm so not a sci-fi/fantasy geek...,"I overheard a woman at my beauty salon talking about it nearly a year ago. After I interjected myself into her conversation, I discovered that we had some similar tastes, so my curiosity piqued. When I told my boyfriend I was interested in checking out the series, he was ecstatic b/c he thought I wouldn't be willing to watch a serial of this genre. Despite the auspicious anticipation and high expectations of it (which usually lead to disappointment, at least for me), I was enamored from the first episode. It's just edgy, sexy, silly and epic enough that you might like it too! Prob too spicy for anyone under 16 though--and even then..."
5,Best Show Currently On TV,"This is the best show currently on television in my opinion. The books are fantastic and the show does a pretty good job of keeping true to them. The acting is top notch by everyone in the cast and the adult nature keeps it grounded in originality. Every episode leaves you dying to know what's going to happen next (unless you read the books before) which I can't say about every show. I'm so tired of seeing tv shows based around hospitals, doctors, police work, or crime scenes. I hope George RR Martin keeps writing books so the show never ends!"
5,Great!,It was a Christmas present plus it's a great show! So ya it worked out just fine! Loved it! Ya
2,Difficult to understand,"I watched the first episode and found it too confusing. I know lots of people love it, but I felt that they threw too many characters at the viewer too quickly and they didn't provide enough explanation of the action to understand what was going on."
2,I just didn't get it,"I had read reviews of Thrones before I rented it. I thought it would be more my cup o' tea but....as the Hispanic housekeeper in Family Guy says: ""no.......no........ees not good...noooooo"""
2,Love fantasy; hated this,"I've always loved fantasy, and I thought I'd love this, but I hated it. It's all politics and no adventure. Every character says exactly what they're thinking except when lying to set up a power play. And virtually every conversation involves one character insulting another by referencing the fact that he or she is a dwarf, eunuch, whore, bastard, or foreigner."
2,Violence,The show itself is of the highest quality but its so violent it just lacks all humanity and since everyone dies there is nothing to follow
2,Not what I expected,"Previews on tv led me to beleive this was a midevil story of intrigue with lots of sword play. I paid too much for the one episode I watched. Sorry, but since I didn't enjoy the first viewing experience I will not be watching any more of it."
5,Ah-mazing!,Love GOT!! It is an addiction for me. I love this show. I watched every episode and plan to watch all the rest.
5,Game of Thrones Season One,"This is one of the best shows I have watched for a long time. Great story line...characters that keep your attention. I will probably purchase all of the seasons, even though I watch on TV."
2,ORDERED IN HD,"HAD PURCHASED THE SERIES IN HD, BUT UPON VIEWING IT WAS DEFINATELY WAS NOT HIGH DEFINITION. PLEASE CORRECT OR REFUND.WILL ACCEPT IN BLU-RAY DVDI VIEWED EPISODE 1 IN HD AND THEN PURCHASED THE SERIES. YOU HAVE CHARGED ME FOR EPISODE 1 AND THE ENTIRE SERIES AS WELL. PLEASE CORRECT."
2,8 beheadings in first episode!?,"Come with a story and not with the gory!! Can this be what people are craving? Ridiculous .Over the top gore, if you like that thing get it."
5,Everything I expected,I just got this today and I'm currently in the process of viewing it. The packaging was okay and so far I have nothing to complain. I'm waiting for the second season special edition to come out and get it.
3,Enjoyable,No movie is ever as good as the book but they have done a good job with the characters. Cool opening sequence.
4,Great show but occasional streaming problems,"I really liked the show, but sometimes all the nudity was a but much. Also the streaming from Amazon was sometimes horribly slow. It would stop and back up every 2 or 3 minutes...VERY FRUSTRATING!"
5,Did I just watch through GoT in one sitting? Yes! Thats how good it is!,"The first season was uh-ma-zing. It is definitely rated R though, if you know what i mean. Sometimes the R rated scenes get a little pointless and explicit but they do not take up a majority of screen time so its easy to ignore or skip if your not into that kind of thing. The beginning of the first episode started really slow but once you get to the end you CANT stop watching. Probably after every episode I was like ""WHAT? no, I have to watch the next one now!"" until I got to ten and was sorely disappointed that season 1 was finished, I cant wait for Season 2!"
5,Game of Thrones,I don't have HBO but am a HUGE fan of A Song of Ice and Fire book series so I've been watching a Game of Thrones through amazon and its GREAT. Its the closest adaptation of a book I've seen so far. I am so glad the creators decided to go with an in depth series instead of a movie that would have left out too much of the story. Now people that haven't read George R.R. Martin's amazing tale can get a quality story extremely close to the books :)
5,I love this show!,"The Game of Thrones is an amazing show. The writers are doing a fantastic job of juggling so many characters and fitting them into a TV series. I bought this Blu-ray to watch with my roommates to get caught up before the second season started. Everyone in the house was hooked on this show. Once the second season started, every Sunday became The Game of Thrones night. I highly recommend this series and the best way to watch it is on Blu-ray."
5,Excellent collection of an excellent series,"If you're thinking of buying this, you're probably already familiar with GoT so I won't say anything about the series itself (which is awesome). The collection itself is great. It is well packaged, compact, but everything is preeettty easy to get to. You will need a little space to fold it out. I have mixed feelings on the foldout multi dvd packs, as they are much prettier, but you can't just open to your dvd.The extras are stupendous."
5,LOVE THIS SHOW!!!,"This is a fantastic show that HBO has produced. I love it. I am completely hooked on it. It is so good, that even watching the reruns is exciting. The costumes are superb and the characters are great. HBO isn't afraid to kill of major characters either, refreshing for a series. So who will win the Game of Thrones? I don't know, but can't wait to find out. And by the way, I am not normally someone who is interested in Fantasy media, but this really is a great series.Winter Is ComingMaking Game of Thrones [HD]"
5,Game Of Thrones,"This series will go down as a "" CLASSIC""--Season One was spellbinding,intriguing and captivating !I could not wait to watch one episode to the next...sometimes 3 in one night...I could not walk away from viewing it !HBO GOT SEASON ONE ---SO RIGHT !The acting....ENCORE- ENCORE to the Cast !!!!!!!The filming , scenes and sound are THE BEST YET !!!!!Just purchased Season 2....getting ready to be mesmerized again....captivated by all the characters once again.....Much THANKS to HBO....WELL DONE !I purchased both season 1 and 2 in DVD format......MY question is it worth it to buy in BLURAY...?"
2,Game of Thrones - New - not used first season,The 2nd CD was almost impossible to watch - it skipped and was totally mangled!! The rest were fine but that second one was a bummer!
1,blu-nonray,"These discs are crap. They take ages to load. The menus are worthless, either misleading or nonexistent. The show is great, but this iteration tries my patience. I swear this oath under a heart tree."
4,fantastic so far,"I've only seen a couple of episodes, but so far it's enthralling...plan to buy or rent as soon as whole series is avail"
4,Game of Thrones episodes 1 thru 5,Excellently crafted visual version of the original book. Violence and sex scenes could have been a bit less graphic than shown.
5,Excellent Adaption of Book,"This series is an excellent adaptation of the book. The scenes, background, costumes and especially the actors represent the book very well. I really enjoyed watching what I had read. There were a few scenes not in the book, but you could still see it fitting with what was in the book. Highly recommended."
4,"great quaility, but poor episode organzation","why would they do it this way?disc 1: episodes 1 & 2disc 2: episodes 3, 4, & 5disc 3: episode 6disc 4: episodes 7, 8, & 9disc 5: episode 10"
5,HBO does it again!!,"I happened upon this show by ""accident"", not being a fantasy fiction lover. There was nothing else worthwhile to watch, so I gave it a try - and I was hooked. One of the best series HBO ever created, and they did some great ones. In the meantime I got the books and was super impressed how excellent the HBO adaption of book 1 was. Can't wait for the next installments and for the next book (hopefully not another 4-5 years!). Everybody else already outlined the characters, action, etc., so I will skip this, just one more thing - the ending just blew me away - WOW!! Must have watched it over and over - so dramatic and powerful. Way to go - HBO!"
4,Follows the book very well.,"I really liked this first episode. I've read the book and I feel they really captured each characters look, and personality. Some things were left out, but I think that's the case with any book that becomes a film or tv show. I would recommend reading the books as well as watching the show. Then you won't miss anything. Sometimes there were detail that were so tiny in the show, you wouldn't understand their meaning unless you read the book. All in all, great first episode. I'm so glad they turned this into a show."
1,Missing disk,"Received DVD with five DVD's included, unfortunately instead of disk number four I received two disks labeled number five. Now I must try to obtain disk number four."
3,Some Episodes are Missing,"My copy only has 10 episodes but they don't match up with the book. I feel ripped off. Many scenes from the book are completely removed from the TV series. I know that there are roughly 16 episodes planned for season 1 but I just don't see them here. I've searched high and low. I tried my DVD player, my Xbox, my computer but they all come up with ten episodes.I bought a second copy ($60 a pop) to unlock the other six episodes but that still didn't work. I'm looking at HBO's site right now: sixteen episodes. Why on Earth can't I get to them? This is so frustrating. I expected better of you George RR Martin."
1,"If I wanted porn, I'd buy porn","It is unfortunate that we have come to demand explicit sexual content to say a show is good. This and Boradwalk Empire would be so much better without the sex trade 'actors/actresses' involved.Is HBO getting its funding from the porn industry, like STARZ for Spartacus?Sad that we Americans are taking the low moral ground with our television production. It is especially sad that the entertainment industry gives these folks awards, etc. to hype them up."
3,Game of Thrones: The Compete First Season,"If you want to see and hear the practice of: Idolatry,Blaspemy,Adultery,Incest,Male and Female homo-sexual acts,Rape,Murder,Theft and Fornication you will like this program. The main thing that the featured actors could not have,was a conscience. So most of the featured charaters were conscienceless and were required to be.If you want to see most of the Ten Commandents broken over and over you'll like this body of work. Now don't get me wrong this needed to be done so as to fit into the scheme of this historical story.Charli O"
1,Gratuitous and gore at it's core,"We sat down to watch together and hated it so much we shut it off and went to bed. So many good series out there, there's nothing here of any redeeming value at all."
4,"Great blu-ray set, BUT BE WARNED of future disappointment","I'd like to start out by saying the blu-ray set was absolute perfection, both in the video quality and HBO's treatment of the story. But for those of you expecting to eventually get a fulfilling ending, you might be disappointed. I say that because of books 4 and 5 of the Ice and Fire series. Almost nothing important happens to move the story along in those two books and the plot stops cold. And take into account it took Mr. Martin 11 years to right about nothing happening and you understand why i'm worried about the future of this show and how it's dependent on the book series."
1,Does not play on certain Bluray players,I only found this out after purchasing the product. It does not play on my JVC Blu-ray player. Apparently there is plenty of feedback online with the same issues of failure to play. Some workarounds suggested like leaving a formatted USB flashdrive did not work. Too bad for such an acclaimed series.
4,Series is a good attempt but not exceptional.,"I like fantasy and have read the series. There is a bit of departure from the books, but the differences are minimal. The bad guys are done well, but the ""heroes"" lack some character."
1,Must just be me...,"My wife and I enjoy this kind of story, but we found ""Game of Thrones"" to be dull and vulgar."
1,Porn dressed up as respectable?,We were amazed to see so much bare female skin. Sent this one back. Not at all enjoyable or inticing.
3,average,"There will be no sugar coating in this review. After the first episode, I had to take my rose colored glasses off. Judging the series on its own merits. It deserves the criticism of being politically correct. Spoiler alert: I found it extremely distasteful to turn Renly gay. Obviously, HBO injected a truckload of money into the production and it shows. That money could not overshadow some of the horrid acting in this series. Compared to the novels, the story is pretty accurate except for the lack of wolves. I have no doubt that this series will be lauded not by its own merits, but by the strength of the novels."
3,Interesting...,"Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.The pilot episode of this series is said to be based on a series of books, which I've honestly never read and probably won't have time to read ever. What I find interesting is that it looks like its set in the Middle Ages, which has always intrigued me. And what's that made-up language? Dothraaki? Just what kind of a name is that? So, being as I've never read the source material, the characters and overall plot is somewhat hard to follow."
5,Incredibly good series,Typically violent and sex laden HBO stuff but this is like watching 10 motion pictures in a row. Sadly season 2 and 3 are not out yet or else I would snap them up in a heartbeat.
5,Love the series,An adult program with a fantasy feel. It is based on books that I have not read but I may try reading them now.
5,Game of Thrones on Amazon Instant Video,"Great to be able to locate what I was looking for and immediately after the purchase was able to watch on any device on which I installed the amazon instant video app. Great quality, no issues."
1,0 star,"I read this book when in 1997 when I had to let go of a love affair myself. I was seeking some comfort in this book, but instead I was disgusted by it. The writing is ugly. The story is more than plain. It says ""to everyone who has ever to let go of love"", but I don't feel that there was any love between the writer and Waller. Probably some infatuation. True love will not make one to write such a book. True love should be beautiful and moving and lasting............................... That's all I have to say about this book."
1,I am disturbed that a person would want to destroy lives,I guess MS. St. James doesn't realize that even that unborn baby that was the cause of her supposed love affair ending...has the internet. No one should try to destroy lives. There wasn't an option for 0 stars.
1,Worst movie ever,"I normally would not write a review, but I am ashamed to say that I lost two hours of my life to this obscenely horrible movie. I would have had a better time if I had stabbed myself in the eye five times and tried to bandage it with a soldering iron. If you are looking for a reason to kill yourself, Sonic Impact is the movie for you. Not only was there no Sonic Impact, there was no impact at all. Terrible plot and horrible character development, add to a low budget thriller that I would use to punish my children if they were to pee on the kitchen floor. Ice T was by far the best actor in this movie. If that doesn't give you an impression of its quality, then you probably can't read or write. If you enjoyed Chill Factor, Dante's Peak, or Canadian suspense movies... this movie is for you. I am dumber from seeing this movie. May god have mercy on my soul."
3,"Works great, but only if you use it","... Bought for aging father who I've witnessed having difficulty turning and getting to the edge of his seat to get out of the car.... The cushion is on a lazy susan sort of bearing and moves smoothly, and is more comfortable than where they sit for dinner, but it feels out of place between you and the car seat, plus it shifts with your weight, so it doesn't have the stability and comfort of a car seat.... Since it doesn't feel natural, and possibly makes him self-conscious, this item goes unused, even though it is a genius invention. He'd rather struggle, so it was a pointless purchase, for me."
4,Great resource book.,This is a great resource book for beginning and intermediate costume jewelry collecters. Excellent synopses of many of the great jewelry designers and manufacturers. Lists some of the identifying characteristics and values of some of the 1940's and 1950's designer jewelry that will help to classify unsigned pieces from this era. Beautiful photographs of a multitude of jewelry pieces from various designers. The only fault I found with this book is one that Mrs. Carroll states herself; there are few photos of very early costume jewelry pieces. She advises the readers to review older books on costume jewelry to get more complete information on early jewelry.
5,Fantastic Book,This is the best jewelry book for the beginner to learn all about costume jewelry. Very easy to read and learn. The pictures are visually stimulating and clear.
4,awesome for work,"when they forced us to pay a quarter per cup for the crap work coffee, i decided to bring in a french press. the best thing about this model is you can microwave it, which is handy for me, because the hot water that comes out of our filtered hot water spigot is not as hot as i like it. i haven't had it for long, but it works well and is holding up fine. it's awesome to have good coffee at my desk now. highly recommended."
2,Cracked after less than a year,"My girlfriend gave me one of these as a Christmas gift. After eleven months of being used pretty much only on weekends, it's developed two cracks in the plastic beaker, one about an inch and a half long and the other about 3/4 of an inch long. The beaker itself is also heavily scratched and discolored. I've hand-washed the press; it has never gone in a dishwasher.On the plus side, the coffee from it tasted great. I'm going to buy another French press, but this time, it'll be a glass one."
4,"No problems, 8 cupper","Must have fixed flimsy filter foible, it looks to be well reinforced and has given no trouble. Easy to operate, filter and lid slide straight down with no hassle. Yes it allows for 4oz cups but all the recommendations seem to call for at least twice the coffee I've used in the past so now get half the coffee with twice the flavor. Seems like a fair deal to me."
5,EXCELLENT!,We bought this after first trying a glass french press. The glass one's beak broke almost immediately so we bought this plastic one to try to avoid that. Has been a great purchase and makes excellent coffee.
4,No problems here,"Full coffee flavor without the hassle of filters!We have been using our Bodum coffee press daily for about 6 months & haven't experienced any cracking, melting, gasket breakage, etc. We generally use boiling water from a teakettle right off the flame, too. I hand-wash it daily & put it in the diswasher about once a week to get it really clean.Perhaps Bodum has had some quality-control problems by the look of some of the other reviews; if that's the case, we got lucky & got a good one."
1,Stupid lid design.,"The design of the lid is such that you have to tilt the filter to get it into the carafe. As a result, it is quite easy to get floating grounds on top of the filter.A fatal flaw, as far as I'm concerned. I'll probably go with the Chambord instead."
1,Incredibly Cheap -- And Only Two Cups!,"I was incredibly disappointed when I pulled this thing out of the box. It is cheaply made, and the only 8 cups you might get out of this thing would be demitasse. It is probably good for only two American-sized cups of coffee. I am returning it forthwith."
3,Kind of a waste...,"The strainer on this thing is too big or something. The rubber ran along the sides too hard and it actually tore after about 10 uses. This means ""floaters"". Bad form. I'm crazy about coffe made with a press, just not this one. Its cheap for a reason. May be good for camping, like they said. Not for everyday, though."
3,The Base Cracked,"Like another reviewer, my base cracked allowing coffee to seep out. I used this almost daily for 6 months and washed it in the dishwasher each time."
3,Paul McClan,"Brews very good coffee. However, don't be deluded by their false advertising that it will actually make eight cups. When you receive it you find that the manufacturer has unilaterally redefined a cup as four onces. Then it won't even make that much. Expect less than three and a half honest cups. Still, would I buy another one? Probably."
1,Useless,"I have had great luck with other Bodun french press coffee makers, but this press lasted less than a month. Very poorly made!"
1,Invest in a better model,"My husband and I purchased this press at Target for $10. We didn't want to spend a lot on our first press because we weren't sure how often we would use it or if we would use it at all. We did end up loving having our coffee made this way, but the press broke after only 1 week. We followed the directions very carefully and made sure not to use fine ground coffee. The plastic screw cap for the press pieces wasn't well made and the threads stripped. Now the press pieces (the filters) come apart and it's useless."
4,Very Nice Coffee Press,"Hello after two broken IKEA glass coffee presses, I decided it would be desirable to get an unbreakable one. I found it very difficult to find a new press anywhere but the local starbucks, and since i didnt want glass I went online. This Bodum 8 Cup press seems to have an unbreakable carafe alright, the way the handle is attached seems to be abit off though. It seems to be pretty loosley or haphhazardly attached at the top end of the press. If anything breaks eventually it will be this. This one has been making a press a day, 5 days a week for about 2-3 months. Priced around $20 it seems to be good bang for the buck $$$.MarkRichmond Virginia USA"
1,"Faulty Product, Emailed Company, No Satisfaction","Beaker cracked, presumably due to heat, within weeks of purchase. I emailed the company and about a week later received a reply in which I was told the beaker isn't covered under warranty. The Bodum representative was kind enough to tell me how to order a replacement. Thanks so much.During this time I purchased a nice Thermos Nissan stainless-steel press that shouldn't break anytime soon."
3,COFFEE PRESS,I DONT THINK I AM READY FOR THIS PRODUCT YET. I HAVE TRIED A COUPLE OF TIMES AND NOT SURE IF IT IS ME OR IT???
4,I look forward to another in the series but,"I hope the author does a better job managing the characters. The ending felt tacked-on; yes, we learned the killer's identity, but in a rather abrupt manner. Felt as though a timer had gone off, sort of the end of an exam: ""Fingers off the keyboard, pass your work forward to your publisher."""
5,Live on Broadway,"This album is recommended by me! Listen to it, if you haven't already!*****5 stars, this album will get."
2,Don't expect too much from this book.,"As with most books written by athletes, this book reeks of self-obsession. I had to put it down multiple times because I got so tired of reading about how good, smart, deserving, etc., he was. Contrary to many of the reviews on this site, it doesn't reveal anything particularly hilarious, stunning, or even that insightful. I'm not sure what I was expecting to get out of this book, but on the whole it was quite a disappointment. Buy it used or make sure you can sell it to someone else for a few bucks."
2,Check the Facts,"Bought this tape to use in my class room. It basically provides a chronological review of the presidents giving a little bit of a biography of each man and a brief overview of what was going on in the country at the time--just what I wanted. Make sure you watch and listen closely because it is factually incorrect in places--Lincoln was NOT elected to the U.S. Senate and McKinley was not assassinated one month into his second term--to name a couple. Ironic for something touted as ""Just the Facts."""
1,Too Much History Goes Missing,"Book 13 of a series on colonies for children's education, Rhode Island: The History of Rhode Island Colony... misses too many of the facts that make Rhode Island the foundation of American freedoms of speech and separation of church and state.Dr. John Clarke, one of America's foremost statesmen and author of Rhode Island's King Charles Charter of 1663 is missing! When Wiener runs short of material, she reverts over to MA history.If this is how America teaches its children, it is unfortunate."
5,They LOVE these things!!!,"My step-daughters are 12 and 14, and they love these things so much it's almost a problem! I've had to make rules about homework and chores! They really teach them about the responsibility of owning a pet, and they are always very dissapointed if the pet dies.The only drawback is the little ball on the antennae breaks pretty easily. Also, check with your childs school to make sure they are allowed. My step-daughters ""forgot"" that electronic devices weren't allowed at their school and got in troulbe for brining them! Now they reset the clocks so that the pets sleep during the school day."
2,Tamagotchi broken,"I bought a tamagotchi from amazon, and it won't link up to other tamagotchi's, I bought 2 1 works 1 don't, can't see spending more money on this piece of trash to get it fixed."
4,Great hardware - dodgy software,"Update:They just sent a free update to Destinator mapping software and maps.This changes my review to 5* and I now recomend this to everyone.Great features and great software.Can't be beaten for the price.Pros:Half the price of comparable sized and featured units (except software)5"" screenGreat soundClear screenSolid constructionSupports DivX and other movie formatsFM transmitterBluetooth connection with phoneWall and car chargerCons:Bulky (but it IS a 5"" unit)Software is cheap, poor quality, and not intuitive (support is working on a solution)"
1,"Specifications look great for the price, but.....",I purchased one and it arrived DOA. I think I'll go with a Garmin instead.
3,sure could've used a red pen,"A Sunday Horse suffers from a lack of editing. The first chapter is terrible and the second is boring. Vicky Moon is a charming writer but somebody should've convinced her to either cut these two chapters or combine them into one. The book doesn't get fun until chapter three when she tells the story of a bizarre horse kidnapping. After that the book takes off with stories of grooms, writers, vets, carrot sellers, braiders, riders, and all the people who make the grand prix circuit run. One thing I really liked about the book is how Moon makes it clear that a person may not be a great rider and may never win the big shows but with talent, detrmination and flexibility they can still have a career that keeps them ""in"" horses.I almost gave up during the first chapter but decided to keep reading because hey, I'd already spent my money, and I'm glad I kept going. Hopefully Vicky Moon will come out with a new edition that is packaged better.."
1,An absolute mess,"In the hands of a talented writer backed by good content and copy editors, this book really could have been something. Instead, it's a disjointed mishmash of name-dropping (an earlier reviewer's assessment of Moon's style as breathless is right on the money) and rambling attempts at folksy storytelling, riddled with grammar problems, non sequiturs, and typos. Let's just say I'm glad I bought it used."
1,Just a bunch of name dropping and celebrity worship :(,"I am a horsey person and was hoping this would have more content related to the actual horses and the actual show jumping!Instead, it was a breathless, and not particularly well written, run through a long list of celebrities and tedious accounts of how much various things cost. Yawn.Did you know that Bruce Springsteen and Glenn Close go to horse shows because their kids ride? Big deal. Having spent plenty of time traveling the East Coast horse show circuit as a junior rider, I know that most horse people are singularly unimpressed with celebrities and name dropping...who IS the target audience for this book? Not horse people."
3,The final straw,"As Talk Talk fans know, this album was prepared without the band's consent, who sued EMI and won. By court order, the album's officially out of print, but it's cheap here used anyway.As for the tracks, ""Happiness is Easy"" was already done by Paul Webb and Lee Harris as a 12"" B-side. The rest are done by various people outside the band. It's guilding the lily. Most of them are just regurgitations, but at least it's not a long repetitive 200 bpm acid house rave or a mash-up like there is now. By this time, Talk Talk had moved into post-rock, released their last album on another label, and then split up. Like other '80s relics, they were on the way out anyhow, with grunge entering the charts.Originally released on EMI (USA) in the US and Canada, and Parlophone for the rest of the world."
3,More action than adventure.,"My husband liked this more than my 7 year old son (who I purchased it for). I should have realized that it would be more action than adventure since it was titled ""The War years"". It was still good, I just prefer the more creative and unique adventures of the other Indi titles."
3,"The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Vol. Two - The War Years","I must agree with others who have written reviews; while the scenery is excellent some of the story lines are extremely weak...definitely priced much too high and desuades most of us from buying good entertainment although it is up and down in depth.I will wait a very long time or just never buy unless the price goes down considerably.Also, each series should mention the number of episodes in a given series."
2,Exhausting after a point,"I really enjoyed this show, especially the end of season 1 / beginning of season 2 when they had Indy grow up. Then he went to WW 1 and he stayed there, and stayed there and worked for different armies, and traveled to different continents. Then I decided this show did in fact properly suck. Didn't finish it, won't even attempt season 3."
2,This is not new!,"Found an old copy (1999) of Young Indy (Treasure of the Peacock's eye) and watched it. There I discovered all the episodes in this DVD collection are actually re-cut and edited back then, not now. Old Indy was gone on that tape. All that was left of him was his hand closing the notebook at the end of the show. It also has a promo clip on most of the tapes available and they are all ""Chapters"" like the DVD we have now. So I guess they are just putting out the tape on DVD plus the documentaries as extras in this ""new"" collection."
4,Great Gift for Dad,Bought this box-set for my Dad's birthday. I purchased the first volume as well (he loves this series) and they both arrived quickly and in good condition.
1,Young Indiana Jones Volume Two,"I got caught up in the hype for Indy 4, so I brought these dvds when they were on special. I put on disc 1 and pretty much turned it off after 10 - 15 mins. I didnt like it. I had never seen the series before and it just wasnt what I was expecting."
4,Indiana Jones Par 2,It was cool getting the Young Indiana Jones in the mail and redisover the adventures he had when was younger. This taking me bak to my younger days.
1,Lily Pons,"This book is nothing but a complilation of magazine articles. I was so disappointed. Nothing about her personal life that a fan doesnt already know basically she was married to Kostelantz and recorded for RCA & Columbia and that she was nervous before a performance, It was just an attempt to make a buck off her 100th birthday. Shame on the writer of this so call biography!!!!!"
4,For Turcophiles only,This is an excellent documentary but you have to know Turkey's recent history quite well to appreciate it. As a piece of political science it is an insufficient document.
5,great starter puzzle,"This is a great starter puzzle for little hands. We bought it for my 1 year old's birthday because my 2 year old had 2 similar puzzles and its a great first step for hand-eye coordination. The picture of the puzzle piece is behind the piece itself which makes it easier to match and put it in accurately. Because of this important step which assures early success, she is much better at puzzles in general."
2,Too bad they changed it....,"My daughter loves this puzzle when we're at the library. I wanted to get one for home, but was so disappointed to see that they're no longer solid paint, but stickers. Children chew on puzzle pieces. It's going to happen, and when it does, the sticker comes off. Such a shame..."
2,Pieces are not painted,"I love the concept behind Melissa and Doug toys. Non-toxic paints. Wood products. A little more natural and a little better for the environment. We have the fish bowl that my 16 month old son absolutely loves. The fish bowl has been great and holds up well to his 16 month actions. This puzzle was a real disappointment. The pieces are covered in stickers,not painted and I keep pulling wet sticker paper from his mouth. It's really colorful and I love the concept behind teaching him about sea creatures but this puzzle is just too poor of quality."
5,Great puzzle,"Always love Melissa and Doug Chunky puzzles, and this is no exception. The pieces are high quality and have lived through a beating from a toddler. Still look new."
3,You gut what you pay for,"We have several M&D puzzles. This is the poorest quality. The paper glued on was already pealed off a huge section of the corner when we got it. I didnt want to deal with the return process, but it was a bummer. I have seen some other brands that have nicer quality, but they tend to be twice the price, so I just accept that you get what you pay for."
5,Put the pleasure back in mealtime,"If you've been grappling with the Food Pyramid for the past 20 years, this book will put the pleasure back in mealtime, eliminate guilt, and get you back in touch with your own feelings of hunger, satiety, and fullness. Have you ever noticed how people who are worried about their own health are no fun, and often less healthy than those with a more relaxed attitude? Read this book, relax, and enjoy your food!"
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I wanted to like this book. Satter has been recommended by people who share my beliefs about child development and child rearing--ie. honoring autonomy, encouraging self regulation, authoritative not authoritarian parent-child relationship. However, the info on nutrition and food is so disappointingly poor and inaccurate. The menus, recipes, cooking info, nutrition advice come out of the 70s-- canned mushroom soup? bread and butter with every dinner? meal patterns based on fats, carbs and proteins? Margerine? Sugar is not harmful to the body? Instant Ramen? A hamburger, bun and fries are a decent meal?I kept looking at the publish date to make sure this book wasn't written in 1977. It was actually in 2008."
4,Pretty good camera,The camera works very well. Setting up the computer connection is easy. Uploading is easy as well. I carried this camera around in my purse for days and did not have a problem with it. I would suggest getting a Memory Card to record pictures on if you want to take a lot of pictures. Between the memory on the camera and a 64mg I was able to take about 55 pictures in high resolution.
3,"""Join up"" instruction excellent, text of book far fetched","For the serious horseman (or woman), the Appendix is the only portion of Mr. Robert's book that is of any value. Mr. Robert's explicit step by step narration on ""join up"" is an excellent tool for understanding the horse's non verbal communications with you and other horses. However, the entire text would appear to be a very poor attemt at self permotion. If the equine trade publications are correct in their accusations, Mr. Robert's will loose all credibility which is a shame in that his message will be met with skepticism and may for all intents and purposes be lost."
3,Ok,I thought this book was an instructional book not a history of the writer. While it was not what I was looking for I would reccomend it.
4,People that berate these methods are stupid...,"I've never seen monty roberts in person, never watched another person try his methods, nor do I have anything to say about the people who don't like his methods, but take it from someone who trains, it works. I'ver been using this method of training for 2 years now, and let me tell you, it's a godsend. My horses trust me, are more responsive, handle new situations easily, and work well with all people, not just their trainer. If you have a problem with his methods, you're doing somthing wrong. I've trained over 40 horses in this manor and never have I once had a problem. Maybe the book in itself is a lie, who knows, I personally don't care. If someone is so obsessed with wether it's true or not, you need to get a life. If you get anything out of reading it, it should be that gentlness and trust are what make an equine relationship. As for buying it, rent a copy and save yourself some money."
3,interesting story but not well written,Introduction is way too long and repeates all that the author writes in the story. Several unexplained incongruities. Man who rides in horse shows from age 4 on. Yet says he wants to work for free for some horse trainer when he is 40 years old.
3,At least one mystery of the universe is revealed,"This book is one that needed to be written in order for new insight into the nature of animals (of which human beings are a subset, after all) to be shared with the world. The style of the book did not strike me as being compelling - Marty Roberts is a horseman, and not a writer - but what he has to say is well worth paying careful attention to.I'm thinking of trying some of his methods on my child, actually: send them to their room without argument until they come back contrite.Any sensitive, searching soul who wants to learn more about the world around them, the language of natural animals, free from the influence of human social conditioning would enjoy this book."
5,Monty Roberts: This man is the Real Deal,"Having seen Mr. Roberts on television demonstrating his ""Join-Up"" technique with unruly horses, I'm a little bit shocked at the number of accusatory & negative reviews I'm reading on this page. Especially from people who seem to have never actually read his book.For those of us who believe that horses are naturally social creatures, and that a little gentleness & patience towards any animal is a far better training technique than trying to force a creature against its will, this is a terrific book."
5,This is a life changer!,This book will change the way you view animals and humans. It will change your whole outlook on life. The world would be much more peacefull if everyone would take the time and read this book..
4,Good book,"I really liked this book, because it's not like many other books about horses. An interesting man, with an interesting story. I almost liked it as much as Nicholas Evans' Horse Whisperer!"
4,Monty Roberts is a child psychologist as much as a horse psy,"When Roberts' humane methods are used in classrooms all over America, education will advance by light years. Drill and Kill will be no more. Producing students who come to us wanting to learn will parallel the horse who chooses to ""join up,"" as it is termed in Roberts' methodology. What colleges of education really need is a Roberts method department head who will spread his sane approach to new teachers everywhere."
5,Simply revealing. A lesson to all of us insensitive.,All the principles taught by MR apply in avery path of life. It seems like if we practice MR's approach not only with horses but with other animals (and people)we are out to gain and enrich our lives.... make ourselves better beings
5,Encouraging to those who think cruelty must be used.,"I have seen Monte Roberts. His ability to take the most obstinate and nervous horses and make docile pets of them is awesome. They respect him and more importantly, he respects them.No spoken language can achieve what Monte does with silence kindness.."
5,The most useful horse training book I've ever seen!,"Mr. Roberts captures a side of horse training described by Xenophon and a few others, but practiced by few owners and trainers. It is a must-read for anyone who ever comes into contact with that marvelous animal - the horse. He teaches, in a way humans can understand, the language of the horse. His methods are learned from years of observation of wild horses combined with compassion, thought, and common sense. Highly recommended, read this one and throw the rest away"
1,This only got 1 star because they didn't have 0.,Research this man before spending. I think you'll find it eye opening.
1,LIMITED VALUE,If you must read this check it out from the public library.Too much self-promotion for my cup of java.
1,moneybags monty - a shameful charlatan,a braindamaged baboon couldnt believe a word of this dross - and neither should you. the only reason hes gotten away with it for so long is because the people buying his crap wouldnt know one end of a horse from the other - morons attract morons after all.ask the woman whos horse monty virtually destroyed running it into the ground chasing 'wild' mustangs. ask the woman who was nearly killed by her horse after monty 'trained' it. check the history records and see if you can find a skerrick of truth in any of montys books.anyone who knows anything about horses finds monty laughable - buy his offensive rubbish and well all be laughing at you too.
2,The only thing he loves more than horses is himself.,"When Monty Roberts describes the horses that he has met in his life, it is truly beautiful prose. His descriptions of their personalities and courage make great reading for a person who loves horses and riding. Unfortunately, those descriptions are few and far between. Most of the book is blatant self-aggrandizing from a man who claims everything from inventing the slant-load trailer to establishing the quarter horse breed. Where he isn't tooting his own horn, he is villifying his past enemies, all of whom are conveniently dead and can't contest his wild claims. The equine press has blasted this man and his book, and rightfully so."
4,Great Gift for Horse Lovers and Riders,Monty Roberts has done the horse world a great service by sharing his non-violent training methods with us. His love of horses leaps off of every page as he describes the old training ways of his father and the conflicts and punishment he endured to continue with his training methods using horse language and body language. This is a pleasure to read and a learning tool to teach all of us who work with horses how to understand their fears and gain their trust.
2,"Good, but overhyped","Monty Roberts writes a good book, but he claims to have originated too much. Competent trainers have been quietly training horses for the last century. John Rarey, author of ""The Rarey Method of Horse Training"", was doing this sort of thing around the turn of the century. Patti Hughes, in California, does it today. Admittedly Roberts' techniques are in contrast to what Vicky Hearne (""Animal Happiness"") once called ""what passes for training on California racetracks"", but they are not at all unique to him."
1,More story than training!,"This book does read more like fiction than fact, and the only training in the book is a small chapter in the back. I agree it is just a money making ploy. I watched Monty Roberts live, he does the exact same thing as John Lyons, but with out the sense of humor, and alot more ego."
4,"Good reading, but not a how-to book","This book is about the man's life and experiences with horses. It is insightful and easy to read. Unfortunately, I was looking for a book to help me train horses the way he does. Mr. Roberts doesn't give away many of his secrets. After stating that he had learned almost 200 hand and body movements which are understood by horses, he never told the reader how to do them. After reading the entire book, I found 7 pages in an appendix in which he explains the ""join up"" procedure. However, if you are looking for a book about an interesting man who has led a very eventful life with horses, this is it."
3,A must read for all horse lovers!!!,This book is great! Will touch your heart in a profound way. I can't believe how detailed this book is. There's no way someone could make this up!!
1,Horse Whisperer and Strory Teller,"If you like Monty's fictional book, be sure to read ""Horse Whispers & Lies"" by Joyce Renebome and Debra Ann Ristau. For more information on horse-human communication and relationships, read ""Natural Horse-Man-Ship"" by Pat Parelli and anything by John Lyons. Mark Rashid has written entertaining, thoughtful, and true horse tales in ""A Good Horse is Never a Bad Color"" and ""Considering the Horse."""
1,the man who listens to horses,"very egocentric, claiming such fantastic things, that i had to google him. his book is full of outright lies. why not just be a fiction writer?"
1,Over Rated,"I was in my teens when I first read ""the man who listens to horses"" even at that time I thought that he was arrogant, he was far from humble.Before I read Monty's book I had read books from Ray Hunt,Tom and Bill Dorrance the true masters of Natural Horsemanship (horse whispering if you want to call it)"" I felt in my bones that I'd descovered something new that would significantly change the way humans relate to horses"" was a quote from monty's book but these ways have been around for hundreds of years. really it's nothing new... He was just the first to Advertise it and call it his own. Don't get me wrong though, he is a good horsemen I grant him that."
1,Just a load of...,"This book really belongs in the fiction section! While the methods do work, it's mostly because they've worked for hundreds of years before Roberts came around. He just happens to be taking all of the credit for it. He admitted years ago in an article to Horse & Rider that most of the story part of his book was falsified -- he never studied wild horses as a 13-year-old, he never lived off of cheap diet drinks just so that he could afford to work with horses. It's a cute story, but it's not true! He used it simple to help his wallet. The only difference between Monty Roberts, and John Lyons, Pat Parelli, and all of the other trainers is that Roberts goes out of his way to dream up ideas to make himself more marketable. Of all of the pages in this book, the only ones that are worth the paper they're printed on would be the ones that explain the methods, and even those are not necessarily his own. Don't waste your money!"
1,"Liar, Liar!!","This book should only be sold as fiction and come with ""Horse Whispers and Lies"" attached. Monty, shame on you...trying to take credit for inventing the slant load horse trailer, making claims to have been a Champion Calf Roper, and going to horse shows in a railroad box car?His family says that it's all a bunch of lies. The content of the book on horse handling is good, but Monty Roberts did not invent the methods used. They have been around for years.Monte, is a good horseman, he should not have made the preposterous, boastful statements that are included throughout the book."
5,"Amazing book, should be required reading for everyone","I saw Monty on Dateline and had to get the book. I must say, it is great reading. Unfortunately, I see too many of the reviews taking it literally, horse starting. This is a must read for anyone who works with horses in any capacity. I fell into horse starting by accident - had a foal we didn't know was coming (don't ask, I was 9 years old) and later bought a starved horse I couldn't ride. Because I was abused, I had no one to confide in and my horses, dogs and cats became my confidants. As I result, those that I did this with were connected to me, very deeply and the other animals around were more like pets. I heartedly recommend this book, if you love to read, want to read an inspirational book, or would love to be connected to your horse, rather than feared or misunderstood, here it is in a wonderful read."
3,Many lessons we all need to learn!,"While I did enjoy reading this book, I was somewhat disappointed at the scarcity of real, in-depth information on Mr. Roberts' techniques. While catharsis is healing for the soul, the lengthly discourse on his troubles with his father were somewhat distracting. There were, however, many lessons in gentle teaching to be found in Mr. Roberts life, and as a teacher myself, I can relate to them all. As a horse person, I was especially intrigued by the stories of ""joining up"". Chronologically, the book makes several jumps within the past, and this leads to much confusion for the reader. Many times I found myself looking back to a former chapter or page to see what year I was reading in. I finished it in 2 days (a little under 8 hours), and that says something for it...I couldn't leave it alone for long."
5,A MUST have!,"I bought this while visiting relatives in Hawaii, and I immediately fell in love! Her voice just takes you back in time when Hawaii was ruled by royalty. I love listening to her and her husband Iolani sing. And not because they are ohana. Even if they weren't, I would still tell everyone, if they already have not bought it, to go out and buy it. It's a MUST have!!!"
4,An broad perspective on ecological ethics,"Sterba has compiled a comprehensive list of readings on topics relating to ecological ethics. That is, issues important to conciencious citizens of earth and how they should act to best preserve their global environment and treat their fellow inhabitants. Many of the separate readings put into perspective the moral and ethical teachings of past and present, and apply them to an increasingly earth-responsible perspective. Furthoremore, an obvious effort by the authors to draw similarities amoung themselves into a cohesive statement of ecological responsibility succeeds without compromising differences in each perspective. My only critisism is the inconsistency in citation style that leads to insufficient detailing of sources for certain facts used to support important positions. This is especially true of the two political writers. Citing the sources for data quoted would lend heavier credence to the positions they expound."
4,Old Fashioned CLASSIC,"You're crazy if you don't have a soft spot for Chuckles. You know darn well that they were one of your favorites as a kid, and you can't resist a package (or two) even today. I love the Cherry flavored, and wish that they would introduce a Red-only package of Chuckles (if only for a limited edition, and boy would I hold on to a few of those for posterity). A tip for you Chuckles-lovers-- freeze 'em! They last a lot longer that way and are well complimented by your favorite non-caloric beverage (we ladies need to watch our expanding figures, unless the stork is on the way). God Bless Chuckles."
