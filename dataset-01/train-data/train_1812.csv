1,This item is junk!,"This is a very low quality buffing wheel, spend a few extra dollars and get a different one. I have used several different buffing wheels, this one is the worst of them all. This thing is like the Hitler of Buffing wheels! Beware!"
2,Yawn.,"""Tussles in Brussels"" is the new DVD by garage rock outfit The Hives. It's made up of a documentary that totals 30 minutes, an hour long live concert, and bonus videos that add up to half an hour. Two full hours and not a single moment of brilliance. Yawn, next ""the"" band please."
2,The problem with Margot Leverett...,"Clarinet is a beautiful and adaptable instrument that has been pigeon-holed into classical, klezmer and trad jazz music for way too long. Eddie Daniels showed the way for modern jazz clarinet, and I hoped Leverett was going to do the same for bluegrass so I bought her 'bluegrass' album (and no, I'm not a die-hard bluegrass fan). After listening to it, I am not surprised at all that the majority of bluegrass players want nothing to do with her, and in fact I'm fully supportive of them not doing so. It seems that while she is a very capable klezmer clarinetist, she is a god-awful musician, by which I mean that she has zero respect for any musical tradition other than her own, and is always seeking the spotlight. There are only a few tens of seconds across the entire album where she attempts to play anything even remotely like bluegrass. This album contains almost no musical innovation whatsoever."
2,Lacking the Fire,"I too was very disapointed with the DVD version of Spirit. I have the VHS original and have watched the performance, spellbound, each and every time since I first saw the performance on PBS. The DVD version is a ghost of the original. It lacks power, and cohesion. Gone are the brilliant dance segments. The performance has lost the rhythm and fluidity which made the original so powerful and deeply profound. I found the visuals to be distracting at best. The feather dancers are wonderful and, thankfully, Chief Pope Hawk remains compelling. With all due respect to the performers and creators there is just no comparison. I'll be looking into someone to copy my VHS to DVD."
4,A complete guide to braiding horse tack.,"Woolery has included a wide variety of braiding techniques and their application with regard to making horse tack. Although all of the examples are western-type tack, the pieces of tack described are useful to any horseman. Learning how to make your own tack can be very handy out on a trail when something breaks, and Woolery's book has enough information to become an expert or a competant amateur."
2,Buy a different book.,"After reading ""Leather Braiding"" by B. GrantLeather Braidingthis one pales by comparison. Illustrations and cryptic instructions are not very user friendly. If you are serious about horse tack then maybe it's for you. But if you want to make some pretty and useful everyday items go for Grant's book."
3,Can't use with security...,"I agree that it was easy to install and seems to be working correctly but when I put security on it, I can't access it at all. I tried to find a tech support line but none of the info that came with it is still active. The email address for eHome isn't there anymore, I tried going onto Dlink since eHome is a division and they don't have this model anywhere under their line of products. I just need to know why even I can't access it once it's secure. I'm sure it's something that I didn't do (I'm not an IT person by any means)but I need someone to tell me what that may be. Good product...bad support."
2,NOT FOR XBOX360,"THIS ROUTER WORKED OK WITH MY WIRELESS LAPTOP CONNECTION, BUT COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK FOR MY XBOX 360. I OPENED ALL THE PORTS NEEDED AND STILL COULDNT GET IT TO WORK. SO IT WORKS OK JUST NOT GOOD TO CONNECT YOUR XBOX 360 WIRELESS WITH APT."
5,Great works from Timbooktu,"Journey to Timbooktu is an excellent array of works found on one of my favorite websites .... I have been inspired by so many of the poems featured on the timbooktu website and now this anthology has brought the talent of so many together. These authors so eloquently address all issues of the African American culture and Mr. Vaughan has divided their works up into chapters that uniquely describe their subject matter. If you are a poet, writer or just have a love for literary talent this collection of poem, essays and short stories will certainly captivate your mind.I highly recommend this book to all with an appreciation for writing and the expression of our African American Culture. Great job Mr. Vaughan and I knew with your insight and vision you could see this through."
3,Made during WWII,"This movie is typical of many made during the war. What is so interesting about all of them, is that they didn't know how the war was going to end, therefore they all ended on an inspiring note. This one is no exception, although I wish it had more action in it. Almost all have the ending trailer ""Buy War Bonds in the Theater""."
4,POWERFUL VOICES,"Young tenors at their individual and collective best. Powerful, dynamic, and emotionally charged performance.Good selection of vocal works for the newcomer, some light, some heavy."
3,Nice watch,"Watch is nice....more designer than durability based on weight and feel. Will be interesting to see how it holds up. It does look good, and fits well. Easy to use."
3,Good but could use improvement,"It is serving it's purpose and a decent product overall. Great for a pickup truck.Why I rated it a 3 out of 5 is that it comes with a bolt that needs to be tightened in the vehicle hitch.One can't just use the usual clip that we all use for connecting trailers, etc to our trailer hitch.That means that if you wish to use this hitch mount T on a van or suv it's a pain and time consuming to get into the back of your van or suv."
3,"Good fit, but they're not soft!","The cut of these boxer-briefs is the major redeeming factor. They're perfectly situated and look great. However, I had been expecting silk boxer-briefs to be...well...soft. These are scratchy and rough. Not what I was hoping for at all."
1,Not Wide,"This product is made of flexible plastic. When you put a standard sock (mens 1 size fits all) on it, it closes up enough that if you have a wide foot, your foot will not go through. I have a 10EEE foot and in rehab I had a wide sock aid that was rigid plastic and I had no trouble at all. Also, there are sharp corners on this item and you will have to file them or you will scratch your foot and ankle."
1,Not sure,"Maybe good, just haven't read, not bible KJV based so I am not interested personally I think this is for jewish people as that's why I bought it to find out more about Jewish people using this book"
2,"Musically sublime, audio quality disappointing","I have waited years for this album to be released on CD, but listening to it this week has been a big disappointment. Rather than digitalizing this from the master tapes, this CD was quite obviously made straight from vinyl - complete with hisses, pops, etc. Especially poor toward the end (ruining one of the finest recordings of Icarus with McCandless at his best). I really expected more and suspect the members of Oregon had very little to do with this release. C'mon folks, yank this off the shelf and give us the real recording. I still have my vinyl version of this and it is easier to listen to."
5,Really as advertised,"The order was for an exceedingly rare early album of Oregon; it appeared on my doorstep exactly on time and as perfect as its promotion said it would be. Each cut of this double album was perfect, no skips, pops or scratches. Even the cover is a virgin! The best!"
5,Loved it!,"This was one of the best historical romances I've ever read. The plot was completely different. I read a lot of historical romances and always appreciate an original plot. The characters were developed so well, and both the main characters were very likeable, but the reader is left suspicious about their motives until the very end. I had no idea how the story would end. Also, the writing itself is wonderful. I will read more by this writer!"
3,"Intriguing at the start, drags until the end","It has been years since I've read anything by Judith Ivory. Although I have nothing by her in my keeper library, this one sounded clever and unique enough for me to give it a go.Well, it all started off okay. Stuart is interesting and Emma is hardly the rich virgin. I liked that she felt guilt about doing devious things. At first the dark and brooding Stuart was sexy to me. Then he got a little creepy. Although, I did like that he actually liked Emma. Judith Ivory's writing style isn't my favorite, but had the plot been more riviting, I might have liked it better.At some point about mid-way, it all begins slow. There is so much side detail that I started skimming. It took forever for the plot they were cooking to even get started that it took all I had to stick with it. The ending was so dull and predicable that I was disappointed. Others may like, for me it was a low okay."
5,Almost perfect book,"I'm only writing this because someone gave this three stars and it would be a shame to miss this book because it didn't get universal rave reviews. It is one of Judith Ivory's finest books, and all of them (including the ones she wrote under Judy Cuervas) are exceptional in the writing, the characters, the desciptions and details. She is a master story-teller and this book is hard to put down and hard to forget. Go with it. Go with the Chair Incident. Enjoy it. The characters are charming, interesting, complex and delightful."
4,The Sting during the Regency!,What a pleasant improvement on some of the other books by this author. Her writing style seems to have improved tremendously and in some scenes you practically feel like you are there. Well done detailing. The elements of the Sting operation were new and unusual in a Regency. Nice touch. I have to agree with the other reviewers though that Stuart was a bit of an anomaly. Initally the dark mysterious hero battling a stutter (I loved the scene where we first see him) he suddenly turns into a blase brash young man who is not too appealing. All in all a fine read if you like romances.
2,Slow and slightly disturbing.,"I really struggled to get through this one. It seemed to drag to me. I wasn't crazy about either protagonist, and their treatemtn of each other -- especially Stuart's actions -- were often borderline creepy. Too often his manipulation of her strayed from seduction to putting a toe over the line of rape -- only a toe, but enough to be uncomfortable for this reader. Plus, I never really bought their relationship are true love. Although the last scene is lovely, the sholw is slow and surperficial, with a very mediocre sting plot. I'll pass, and I recommend you do as well."
2,Unsettling romance,"Having read other books by Ivory, I was expecting a better book. The two main characters in Untie... were lacking in dimension, chemistry, and I found it very hard to like them. The plot was dull, the ""sting"" tame, the villian dumb, and the romance ....missing.I have a feeling that this author will now go on my ""get at the library"" list instead of buying her books."
2,Not on my keeper's list...,"Based on some fabulous reviews about this book I was very excited to give it a try. Although I enjoyed the writer's style, I didn't like the two main characters and felt that it lacked romance. If I don't feel a ""love connection"" between the characters I can't enjoy the more sensual scenes and this is the case with this particular story. I will have to try more of the author's works because I did enjoy her sophisticated prose."
1,"Depressing, sorry protagonists, childish tale","This was my first Judith Ivory book, which I read based upon the rave reviews from other authors on the cover. Shame on them.Not only was the entire story childish, but it was ridiculously adolescent. I did not care for our gallant viscount having sex with the sheep farmer tied to a chair, nor blackmailing her. Disgusting. I hope I never have a daughter who reads this kind of trash.Both characters were written like 14 year olds, boorish, silly and unlikeable. A very sad flim-flam scam story gone bad."
3,Not Her Best,"I have greatly enjoyed Judith Ivory's previous works, and was surprised that I did not really enjoy this one. Perhaps its just me, but I am jarred when a character or characters seem to think and behave in ways that jump from modern back to consistant with the times in which the story is set. Or peripheral situations do not ring authentic, or seem glossed over.Anyway, both the hero and heroine are almost very engaging. I almost liked them, unfortunately, they came off more as character veneers that couldn't quite grab my sympathy.Ms. Ivory is an excellent writer, has given readers tremendous reading pleasure, and for that I am grateful. I hope her next novel returns to the 5 star level of all her other books."
3,Just okay - no thrill seeker here!,"I agreed with some of the other reviews on this book. It started off so slow and boring - I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time just to get to the main point of the story. By the middle, it eventually got a little better. It had some ridiculous sex parts in it - that just didn't seem like it fit the ""time"" it was written in, and had no type of chemistry between the two characters that lead up to it. The ending could have been better too. It was an okay book. Not one I would recommend with so many other good ones out there."
2,Didn't last and skipped badly,"Used this cd player for about 3 months and it just died - shows ER(rror) and no way of making it play. I use portables for listening to audio books while walking and this player was simply terrible - it skipped all the time even snug and safe in my tunebelt and I mostly ended up gingerly carrying it in my hand for an hour.If you sit still it probably would be just fine but that is not what I was looking for. But in any case, the fact it only lasted 3 months makes it a waste of money."
4,bad,THis is an amazing ep that jsut makes you crave what will soon be coming with the full lenght. These guys have the credit and streanght to be an amazing band. Chekc them out.
5,a great Milwaukee nailer,"found no flaws with this fine tooldid find some suberb positives ---- quiet, powerful, lightweight, and easy to useone of the best nailers I have used AND, due to the wide array of usable lengths of 16ga finish nails it has allowed me to replace two guns with this single one"
1,Problems setting nails!!!!!!,I bought this nailer for everyday work. I liked the feel of this nail gun but it would not fully drive the nails. I spent more time setting the nails with a nail set. I would not reccomend this gun to anyone for this reason alone. I'll stick with pasloder and hitatchi.
1,not happy,I bought 3-tools only used one did not work very well would not set the nails 1 3/4'' but the gun can shoot larger nails did not even try
3,Amazing what comparments this thing contains... but lacking in leather quality,"If this wallet had a better quality of leather, it would be HOT! I would be willing to pay 50-100... I can see the current quality ripping easily though."
1,Almost worthless...,"This is a very cheaply made film, and the plot is silly and unbelievable. The only thing that makes this movie even viewable is that the long lost Lamont Sanford ""Demond Wilson"" from the classic ""Sanford and Son"" has a small part in this film. It was neat to see him after all of these years. If you are looking for a film that is even remotely interesting however, do not waste your money on this one!"
5,Wilton Excelle Elite 6-Cup Mini Fluted Pan,"Wilton Excelle Elite 6-Cup Mini Fluted Pan, great pan makes perfect size small cake for two people. They are lovely filled with fruit and whip cream. The pans did not stick with a bit of oil and flour."
5,Forget cupcakes! Get shareable drunken bundt cakes with this pan,This size pan creates a drunken bundt cakery Personal Size treat that is about 4 inches around and 2.5 inches tall. Perfect for sharing. You will need to use a net shower pouf to clean it though. The little ridges that make it so cute after glazing and drizzles also make it hard to clean.
5,Love this!,"Makes beautiful mini cakes, perfect size! Have used this over and over again. I bought two so I could fill one up and put in the oven as the other was coming out. Saves so much time"
5,Wilton Excelle Elite 6 cup holder.,"Brand new and arrived in good shape. Have used it yet, but indiviual Rum Cake will be good, a little extra rum."
1,Too much suds!!,"This product probably cleaned the floor, but it made so much suds that I found it unacceptable. Every time I squeezed the mop, it made MORE suds."
4,You've Got Mail Soundtrack,"If you loved the movie you will love the soundtrack! Just listening to it takes you right back to the movie but now you can listen to each entire song, not just the snippet."
1,you've got mail:music from the motion picture,I never got the cd. But they took my money out of my account. I guess it my lost. Will not be ordering from this person again.
3,Oldies Connection...,"If you like the fun-first oldies on this disc as much as I do (Darin, Armstrong, Day, Durante) you'll like the box set ""Rock & Roll Legends,"" in which Darin has his own disc (also featuring ""Splish Splash""). Also includes live performances by Jerry Lee Lewis & Gene Vicent."
4,A mix as charming as the movie,"Call me cheesy (many people have) but this is a really cool CD. Here's a rundown of the highlights: ""The Puppy Song"", a song not so much about puppies as it is about feeling lonely (with a mighty catchy refrain), two essential tracks for any music fan, Louis Armstrong's ""Dummy Song"" and Stevie Wonder's ""Signed Sealed Delivered I'm Yours"" are here, and 2 songs that (for me) were as yet undiscovered -- Sinead O'Connor's ""I Guess The Lord Must Be In New York City"" which is quite sweet and ""I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter"" by Billy Williams (this is another song, which at it's heart, is about loneliness). The mood of the music pretty much reflects the movie, so if you found the movie charming, chances are you will enjoy the CD as well.This is a great mix of songs for weekend afternoons -- it's a cheerful mix that just kinda makes you smile. Recommended."
5,Great!!,"I really love this CD! I have listened to the ""Sleepless"" soundtrack so many times it's worn out and this is just as good. The same sweet musice mix that is timeless. It's really good and I recommend it highly"
5,Great old music for a great new movie,"I bought this soundtrack immeadiately after seeing the film. I love ""The Puppy Song"" and find myself listening to that track over and over before going on to the rest of the cd. There are updated versions of classics (Over the Rainbow), and really fun silly songs (Splish Splash and Rockin Robin). I can't listen to this soundtrack without a big smile on my face."
5,Great!,"I love this thing! It boosts power so I can use the itunes equalizer with much better effect. The volume boost is very noticable. Somebody said that the batteries only last 2 hours, I've used it 3 hours a night for the past week and still going strong. I can hear the sound spectrum a lot better in my headphones. Highly recommended."
4,Worked Great,"Bought this item to use on the family vacation. The children were able to listen to the audio through headphones while my wife and I listened to the car stereo. The audio output from the portable video player was sent to the Boostaroo via a very long extension cable and it worked flawlessly. Signal was strong all the way through the trip on the initially installed batteries. The only feature that I could suggest would be a automatic power off, if no signal is detected for a certain amount of time. There were times when we just forgot to shut off the unit when we left the car, especially after the late night child extractions."
2,Boostaroo-far from perfect,"Big and clunky. Short cable makes attachment difficult. No volume control, which is absurd. Off switch does not just turn off the amp- it disconnects you entirely. Fixed 2X amplification. On light difficult to see.Other than that, it does work.This is a market begging for a superior product."
3,"Amplifies very little, AUDIO cuts off COMPLETELY when off","Can't believe the unit does NOT have a Bypass. When amplification is NOT needed, you MUST unplug the unit, and replug your MP3 device directly to your headphones. Very annoying when traveling. I was hoping to be able to turn the unit on and off when needed, but the audio cuts off completely when you turn the Boostaroo off.Radio Shack had a demostration set up for a boombox. They ""rigged"" the Boostaroo so that a boombox was playing music, and then they were able to switch the boostaroo on (without unplugging or plugging anything else in) and the audio was much louder. I just can't wait to go back with my return and proclaim Witchery at their store! hee hee"
2,Boost-a-what?,"I can't believe the number of disappointments on my last order and the Boostaroo was certainly one of them. I bought it as it was featured with the helmet speakers I bought and some of the reviewers of that product commented that the speakers were on the quiet side. First of all, it's about twice as big as I had expected (about the size of a ""Magic Marker"", but thicker) and it did little to help the pathetic speakers. Secondly, the cords jut out perpendicular to the unit, which is not the best design. I would like to see a product that's just an amplifier with the output cord on one end and the input on the other (which is where that is with the current design.) Also, who in the heck needs to split an audio device three ways? Not why I bought it, but made me curious. Maybe if it was just an amplifier, it could be smaller."
4,Looking forward to it.,"I played one of these at a local music chain and I love the dynamic range, responsiveness, and the edgy sound of the metal body and resonator. I play with an acoustic band making improvisational music for tribal style bellydancers and the volume this baby puts out without even plugging in is essential for competing with the drum line. I love the homage to the National guitar which was one of the most dynamic instruments ever created, the non-electric solution to the problem of jazz guitar (as in - how to compete with the horn section)."
5,Zion Exultant!,"The most powerful music you will ever hear. I can't believe it's unavailable. Such a work of art. I only have it on cassette, so it will wear out soon. The Kol Nidre is so well done it deserves a place in music history. A person doesn't have to know anything about the language or culture to appreciate the whole thing."
1,Unclear labeling,"On the original display of Pamelas cookies, Lemon and Pecan Shortbread there was no mention of gluten free. In the order page in was in very small print that I missed. They were definitely unsatisfactory. I opened the package to taste so felt that I could not return them. So I am stuck with 12 boxes."
2,Gluten Free cookies,"I am not a fan of these lemon cookies. I love other Pams' cookies, but these have a too strong lemon flavor and that's all I taste. I still have most of the case and I may just throw them out."
5,lemon cookie delight,"If you have ever enjoyed a good wheat flour lemon cookie and are gluten free, this is the cookie for you. We keep this cookie on hand to have when we need that little special treat."
5,best tasting Gluten Free cookie,The Lemon Shortbread Pamela's cookie was the best I have ever eaten. The lemon flavor is so robust and you can feel the lemon pieces on you tongue when chewing. A great find!!!!!!!!!
1,"Don't buy them, this is not shortbread",I never write a review but I thought I should to lower the number of stars this product has. We bought the subscribe and save package of 6 and after eating 1 cookie I am thinking on throwing out the rest. The cookies are chewy and you don't feel the crumbles you usually have in a good short bread. They leave a very unpleasant after taste in your mouth. I am extremely disappointed with these cookies. Please buy something else!
4,how i gained five pounds in five days,i wish these cookies weren't so calorie dense cause they are so delicious...so delicious that i gained five pounds in five days.
3,Cookies have a lemon finish,"The taste starts flat, but has a tart lemon flavor on its finish. I wish there was another subtle flavor with the lemon finish. If there was no lemon finish, there would not be much of a taste.I like more crunch to my cookies. Pamela's sugar cookies are EXCELLENT and they are crunchy. I wish the seller would let me know other cookies that have some crunch to them."
1,Just another overpriced text book,"It's a book filled with short stories and magazine articles. Most of the book seemed to center around romance and feminism (the crazy man-hater kind), so i wasn't very compelled by it. Do books like this really need to exist with all the media we have easy access to today?"
1,Not Enough Detail,"I ordered this book for an online class I was taking over the summer. Not only did the book take 3 1/2 weeks to arrive, but it was not the right book I needed for the class! The description read first edition and I recieved the second edition. Don't order from them unless you want to be surprised by your purchase and get it late too."
4,Great Book,"More than one year ago, I met Ruben Palma. It was at the BEA, Chicago, 2004, where he gave me his book: The Trail We Leave. Wonderful and surprising stories. Charming and original characters. Personal, but without narcissism. Spoke to me on a visceral level. Thanks very much! (5 or maybe 6 stars are for Isabel Allende, still my favourite Latin-American writer)."
2,Kinda Lame,Not the movie I thought it was so I was automatically disappointed. Its an ok 80's killer flick but definitely not a classic slasher film.
5,good deal,"Ordered and received product as described in 2 days, even with regular delivery. I didn't order the product for myself, so I don't know about it's effectiveness, but I hear it's a good product."
3,"Good heater, retro a joke","As a heater this does a pretty good job. It's your typical small ceramic heater. On high it seems to heat up my room decently, and the thermostat seems to work pretty well also. The whole retro looking thing kind of falls short. It ends up looking like a mini r2d2, or a little mailbox. Plus most of it is done in plastic. Basically it ends up trying too hard.It's a good heater, but unless you completely love the style, I'd probably look for a cheaper alternative."
3,Just OK quality,"This is an OK heater . . . designed for looks not functionality. The all silver exterior looks like stainless, but is actually just cheap plastic. The heater sounds like a jet engine when starting up, but quickly quiets down and heats reasonably well. It does have a thermostat which is a major plus over many units on the market - but so do many of the old fashion metal exterior cube units that you can buy on e-bay for $15.00. If form over function is your goal - this unit will do fine."
5,Fantastic tart pan,"Last night I made my first-ever tart using the Simplest Apple Tart recipe found on smittenkitchen.com. It baked so beautifully, and the sides released wonderfully. The bottom release was a littler trickier because of the juicy Cameo apples. Next time I'll put a parchment round in the bottom. Cleanup was a breeze. Nine inches is the perfect size."
5,Great Item!,I've only used this one so far but it was easy to use. The bottom piece removed easily for a perfect tarte! Easy to clean too! Hope it holds up for a long time.
5,Great Pan!,"I have never made a tart, so getting this pan was the beginning for a new kitchen adventure. The pan is definitely nonstick, bakes evenly, and washes well in the dishwasher. The tarts I made over Christmas were wonderful, but be forewarned - although the tarts were fabulous, the extra 6 pounds were not!"
5,Wilton nonstick round tart quiche pan,quick service. I have a new recipe and can't wait to use my new quiche pan. Looks like a great pan.
5,Just what I wanted,"What can I say? It's just what I wanted!Graet buy, great pan, great size. The chocolate ganache tart came out like a dream.Other places were charging a lot more for similarly priced pans. This was a bargain, and it performs beautifully."
4,Whatever happened to Pippin?,Well I just read this book and all I want to know is WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?And will there be another book ever?I hope so.
2,"""NO WAY""","I wanted to hear this score because i really liked the ""Iron Mask"" but, I guess the reviews were right. To say that I didn't like this is an understatment by listening to this recording I was glad that I didn't spend momey to see this. Yes, there will be people out there who may not like what I said but, no way, i think that this show got the reviews it got because it deserved them."
5,Don' listen to the other guys,I don't know what those other guys were thinking when they wrote those reviews but Eon:Eon is probably the best written Industrial album of 1998. If you love industrial music this is the best choice for an album of 1998. It's just a shame the judges for the grammys have no sense of taste.
2,Say it isn't so,"This album doesn't even come close to PP standards. After years of great, creative, melodic work this album can be permanently shelved and easily forgiven. PP are to good and this can put down to tour and label deadline demands. I hope. Don't let this be your first PP album."
1,Why did they make this record?,"These guys must have nothing better to do than just release record after record of sub-par generic german-industrial background music. It's one of those cd's that you try to like by listening to it again and again, until you realize that it just isn't getting any easier to listen to."
1,Silly,"This book is silly nonsense. Honestly, I approached it with some skepticism because of the jargony title. I wasn't disappppointed. It's even worse. The best items are those by italian writers. All are substandard, most are junk. This is the opposite of a must-read. A must-pass."
3,card holder,This card holder is to small for some card games. I ordered it for my mother to hold cards while playing Pinochlebut it won't hold that many cards. Would be great for fewer cards or to hold one display card.
3,BING N JOLSON,"THIS CD IS MUSIC THAT ONE WOULD NOT BUY FOR A GOOD LOOK AT CROSBY. i APPRECIATE JOLSON BUT HE WAS NOT MY CUP OF TEA. WHEN HE WAS DOWN ON HIS LUCK BING REVITALIZED HIS CAREER BY LETTING HIM APPEAR ON HIS RADIO SHOW MANY TIMES EACH YEAR.HE EVEN FIXED IT SO JOLSON GOT HIS OWN RADIO SHOW , HE DID THIS BECAUSE BING LOVED JOLSON AND JOLSON WAS HIS IDOL WHEN BING WAS A BOY IN SPOKANE. BING REVITALIZED JOLSONS CAREER, PEGGY LEES CAREER, JUDY GARLANDS CAREER AND SO MANY OTHERS BECAUSE HE LOVED TALENT AND GREAT MUSIC AND WASNT AFRAID OF ANY COMPETION ON OR ANYONES SUCCESS LIKE SINATRA WAS.ANYONE WHO WOULD EVER THINK JOLSON OR LESSER SINATRA WAS BEST AND CROSBY WAS SECOND NEEDS A LOBTOMY.CROSBY SAVED THE RECORDING INDUSTRY AND HE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR SINATRA , MARTIN AND COMO AND ALL THE REST TO SUCCEED BY COPYING HIM.AND THEY ALL ADMITTED THAT.THIS ALBUM IS OK AND ONLY RATED 3 STARS."
1,Non-stick pans always burn around the edges!,"I don't know why no one ever says it because it's always been my experience. Yes, non-stick pans tend to burn around the edges, even if you decrease cooking time. Still, the edges burn while you wait for the middle to cook. The design of this pan is great: it's easy to use and a snap to clean. But the loaves are a little smaller than I prefer and I've tried my two favorite loaf recipes (many times each) so far, and the surfaces ALWAYS overcook, giving a crispy texture I'd rather not have in my breads. It'd been quite a while since I'd tried the newer non-stick pans, so I thought I'd give them a chance, but they're just as always. I'm sticking with the aluminum-type baking pans. They give much better completed results and aren't that bad to clean."
5,Wonderful invention,"When baking for two people I like to make smaller loaves and freeze them. This pan is sturdy enough to handle one handed, when filled and a breeze to cleanup when finished. The cost was easily justified against the cost of small foil disposable pans, and much easier to handle."
4,Great pan!,"It's a great pan, when you cook bread in it instead of as one big one, everything cooks more evenly and you have no soggy middles."
2,disappointed,"I loved this ring when I received it, however, after wearing it one time for a short period of time, the stones split and the top portion fell off. The ring now appears to be missing stones and has lost its sparkle. Needless to say I am very disappointed with the quality of my purchase. Looks nice, but you can't wear it!!!"
3,a difficult album to listen to,"A daring first album by SPK. Everything sounds manipulated and the instruments are not readily identifiable. I think the first four tracks are excellent (1. Emanation Machine R. Gie 2. Suture Obsession 3. Macht Schrecken 4. Beruftverbot), but the sixth through ninth tracks are a bit dull. The latter tracks do not work as well and sound unfinished. Perhaps the two best tracks are ""Emanation Machine R. Gie"" and ""Beruftverbot."" In short, a good Industrial album for those who like Throbbing Gristle and early Test Depatment."
1,Awwww.....,This is really cute they have been doing this before i was born and they have really cute music...keep up the good work fellas just give it time it will come you might only need 30 more years...Your Biggest Fan in the World Lil Trevor...Ps...Those Other guys from Stamford Restricted Records have been rapping for about a year if you need tips call them it might split the 30 years in half...Lil T
4,Strangers In Paradise- A Worthwhile Read,"I don't differ that much from many other teens my age, but in some ways I do. One of those ways is what and how much I read. While many of my friends struggle with eighty-page children's chapter-books, there's almost nothing I enjoy more then sticking my nose in the latest 400+ page novel. I don't usually read comics, but when I stumbled upon Strangers in Paradise, I was intrigued by the brief synopsis on the flap and decided to give it a try.SiP turned out to be one of the greatest reading experiences I've ever had. The plot, and characters, are complex but not imcomprehensible, and the art is fabulous. It's not for people like some of my rather illiterate friends, but I recommend the entire collection of Strangers In Paradise to anyone- comic book reader or no, age doesn't matter- who enjoys a good read."
2,good action premise underwhelming execution,"Insufferably slow start concerning the WWI affair of the naval officer and the lady. Middle section picks up during WWII with the same officer now captain and introduces the Jeffrey Hunter signalman character. Finally we get to the action with the signalman aboard the German vessel where he heroically decides to slow up repairs. Although the cool premise carries the WWII portions, making them watchable, the whole movie botches the potential of that premise. The backstory is simply filler, not in any way motivating the choices of the poorly developed characters. Someone could remake this far better, first by eliminating the whole affair angle."
2,Sailor of the King,"This is an old fashioned, predictable love story. It includes heroism to the corp.This has two of my favorite male actors, Jeffry Hunter and Michael Rennie.What more can you ask for?"
4,good old war flik,no blood or gore but good old action flik.if you like the older war movies this is a good one
5,Good Movie,I purchased this movie solely on the reviews and I am very glad that I did. Jeffery Hunter is very good as is the rest of the cast. The story line is very different for a WW2 movie. The war movies of this era are very well made and I hope we shall see more of them.
3,English Navy story,Enjoyed this movie 20 + years ago and was delighted to finally find it in DVD. It is dated and a little corny but still a nice story and well done in that dry British style.
4,Carry on lads.,"Fox's homage to England's Royal Navy is a decent WW II film. Jeffrey Hunter is appropriately brave, and Michael Rennie is stoic and very British. The surprise is a very interesting Wendy Hiller in the first 20 minutes of the story and then again at the end. Included on the DVD is the alternate ending, which is also quite interesting for an early 1950's movie. The surface battle scenes are very fine."
5,Sailor of the King blu ray,I like War Movie Jeffrey Hunter is a very great actor. I wish the people who make Blu Ray Movie Wood Put On Blu Ray the Movie No Man is an Island
5,nice,"good movie saw it a long time ago a bit far out but fun fast service,great price,hope to watch it a few more times"
2,Didn't get much out of this one...,"This reasonably priced video, is professionally produced and well executed -- but I didn't learn anything from it. It seemed to cover too much ground too quickly for me -- and became ... well, tedious. Some of the items covered seemed ""fringe"" - I would have liked more coverage of core essentials. This video teaching format seems a bit too formula and sterile for my tastes - lots of gloss and not much substance."
2,Somewhat dissappointing,"I eagerly awaited the conclusion to this series. The first book completely snared me: The story of half breed twins whose lives are changed for ever by a mysterious stranger. The second,though not as strong as the first, still held my attention. This third however was a disappointment, heavily bogged down in mysticism and self absorbed characters. The story could have been told in 150 pages rather than 400. Not only that, but loose ends are not satisfyingly tied up. The conclusion feels rushed but at the same time overly long. I know I was really hoping that the story would come back to some of the principals in the first book but it doesn't. They are little more then an after thought and the charas that the novel does focus on simply don't engage the reader's sympathy at all. Read the novel to complete the series but don't expect it to have the same verve as the first two books."
3,An unnecessary sequel,"Storm's writing is great, but this repeated ordeal of Shemyaza feels like Frodo being told that there is another Ring to melt in another volcano. The Grigori story could well have ended whit the previous novel. We would have been spared the executive manager who suddenly speaks like a taliban would and the Iraqi dictator that renegades Islam for an antediluvian deity.If you can't get real, get plausible,at least!"
1,Response to the above review,"It took me 2 hours to find the web site for 10 years. I had finally found the single ""wasteland"" on eBay then went to the record label's website which led me to 10 years' site. The whole thing was a pain in the butt. And the good thing is they sell the CD unlike tower, FYE, Best buy, or any other damn place. Enough wining here's the website ""ww.10yearsmusic.com"". Oh one last thing WTF."
1,Just laughing my *bleep* off!,"I was looking for 10 years with the song Wasteland. Stumbled across this. Im just laughing at this garbage. I hope these guys have back up jobs, like roadies for real bands."
1,Dont waste your money,I thought because it was a Brunswick it would be realistic. I was sadly mistaken. I bought the game used so at least I didnt waste a bunch of money on it. I would be interested to see if the wii version is any better.
1,Absolute Sh..!,Do not buy this game it becomes so aggrivating watching while you play with the unskippable in between frame videos and the play is even worse it gets so unspeakably annoying when your ball goes to the complete opposite side of the lane as you told it to so folks dont buy this trash and save your money.
5,Best Bowling Game Available,This bowling game has everything and the pin action and accuracy of this game comes as close to reality as i've seen. I've played a few bowling games adnthey just don't compare to this one.
4,The real truth,"This is a good game for those times when you just want to relax. The game interface is simple and has a very short learning curve. It does not require a manual! I've bowled in mens leagues for 20 years. If your looking for a lot of depth buy a different type of game. bowling is a relatively simple game and this title delivers with great play. good graphics, sound and animation (although a little dated.) my only beef is some unusal leaves for spare on occasion. Great pin action! I have strung 11 strike in a row in a single game with 2/3 spin and a down and in line. Ifyou really want a challenge try one of the balls that hooks out the door. You will be humbled."
2,"Good for a bowling game, but frustrating","Yes, this is the best bowling game out there. However, that's pretty sad considering that it still is quite unrealistic. Yes, it has the best pin action, but throwing the same shot does not produce the same results each time. I've found that I get splits in the game about 10 times as much as in real life, and I have found I bowl better in the game using no spin rather than some spinn - not realistic. The pro bowlers always throw perfect balls, get 5+ in a row, etc, while the player is stuck with split after split. VERY FRUSTRATING.The worst part? No women. You can't be a woman bowler in this game, which I find disgusting."
1,BEWARE OF USED COPIES,"My used copy proved absolutely useless. As other reviewers have noted, apparently many copies of this ""facsimile"" of a famous book on colors were printed (very poorly at that) in black and white! I just received a ""very good"" used copy from Amazon's inventory that was one of these -- so of course I am returning it. The cover of my copy was different from those shown on this page; it displayed a color image of a seashore with sailing ships in the upper right hand corner. It said on the copyright page that it was a ""NABU Public Domain Reprint"". BEWARE!"
1,don't buy this book,"The editor describes the reprint as a facsimile. He/she might also point out that it's in black and white, and therefore is utterly useless with regard to the intended purpose of the original.Note that the prime definition of facsimile is ""an exact copy, as of a book, painting, manuscript, etc."""
1,Totally worthless,"When I first saw this book, I almost fell out of my chair from laughing so hard. But it would not have been funny if I had spent my money on the book. This must be someone's idea of a sick joke (by someone who knows they can make a quick buck by suckering someone into buying this). A COLOR GUIDE IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS REPRINTED IN GREYSCALE!!!"
1,This book is a joke,"As others noted, this is a book about color that is printed in black and white. One review says that this book is now available with the color, but I just got this and didn't get any color. The copying is so bad that you can't even read some of the color names."
1,2009 edition-not worth the glue in the binding,"hundreds of pages, 35 of which have text, most pages are useless b&w representations of color samples, many pages are even blank. $30 is a bit steep for a photocopy of 10% of a public domain book."
1,Disapproven,"The product is disapproven because not correctly operating. A book that analize conventions about color use in ornithological studies doesn't owe in grey-scale published text. Also the grey-scale copy is low quality level, with too not legibles pages. Is a fraud."
3,Do the job but...,"These things do the job but they are so tiny! They only fit one of the burners on my stove (the smallest one). So unless you have a stove where all four of your burners are the tiniest size available, then I would try to find a multi-pack with different sizes."
5,Excellent Maps.,"Excellent history and types of maps. If you are interested in the history of Arizona, get this book. Detailed maps help with the reading of its past."
2,Disappointment,This volume was a total disappointment. It contained few historic maps of Arizona and fewer details of its history. A large part of the book were boring maps of various demographic details hardly relating to what you would want in a supposed historical atlas. You can find better data free on the web...
3,Not Quite What I Expected ???,If you want information on advanced delegation then this isnt it. However if you are seeking information that will take you through the basics of delegation then this might be a good place to start. This tape set introduces you to the very basics of delegation in a step by step process allowing you to gain an understanding of what delegation means. I wouldnt recommend this to a Fortune 500 Compant Director but in general it makes a great start up compliment for the newly appointed manager...
5,Weightless by Doll Factory,"You need to hear this CD over and over because it will mean more to you each time you listen to the music of Chris and Garrick. Ergo, a purchase must be involved if you care to have this belong to you instead of the greedy Gordon Geckos in the ""music"" industry. (I hope you're too young to remember the quote from ""Wall Street"" : ""Greed is good"".) Chris Roy and Garrick Antikajian would be pretty pleased if you should happen to be intrigued enough by their musical interpretations to purchase it and make it your very own. Believe me, you will never be sorry.XOXO"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book after not being able to find any other images online except the cover. I was really looking forward to owning it; I'm one of those people who collect things like tiny bird bodies, egg shells, nests....It's a beautiful concept, but the format of the book was extemely disappointing; too much white space framed the images, keeping the viewer at a distance instead of inviting intimacy, empathy. The creatures in the photographs often looked posed.The images also would have been more touching if they hadn't seemed so manipulated in color. It was like the photographer hadn't truly been recording the beauty of the ""insignificant"" deaths but seeking and exploiting them by forcing unnatural aspects on them.I also expected this book to be filled with the record of the deaths of bird, rodents, lizards.... not the many images of dying flora that looked like pop culture greeting cards."
5,Excellently achieves its purpose.,"If you want to learn how to write Arabic so that your handwriting would even fool an Arab, there is absolutely no better book available. Most other Arabic language books teach only naskh script, which is the Arabic equivalent of block printing and looks juvenile in handwriting. The few books that actually do deal with ruqah script don't really teach the student how to develop good penmanship. Anbody seriously interested in learning to write Arabic as it is written in the modern world cannot ignore this book."
4,Workbook Keeps Students' Math Skills Sharp!,"""Mixed Skills"" keeps students' math skills sharp by continually reviewing key third and fourth grade objectives and using a spiral approach to education. This workbook is ideal for educators who want a varied daily mathematics practice without the hassle of having to create one themselves. I have used this workbook in my own classroom and have found it to be both convenient and effective. I highly recommend it!"
4,Not your grandparent's Oldsmobile,"This album isn't your standard fare-- music ranging from minimalist techno to jazz-inflected trip hop to orchestral industrial rock laid down as a backdrop to Anna Wildsmith's interesting multilingual spoken word/sung bits. Musical contributors include Euphonic, Raymond Watts of Pig (who recycles one of his instrumental tracks off Pig's ""Wrecked"" as accompaniment to Wildsmith's voice), sundry members of KMFDM, and more. The musical quality isn't consistent-- it goes from really interesting to not that interesting; and alas Wildsmith's voice (the missing link between Elastica's Justine Frischman and PJ Harvey) can grate at times. However, this album is unlike anything you've heard (unless you have the first Sow album, a more consistent but less gripping effort) and that's probably recommendation enough."
1,rubbish,"simply rubbish, lost loose plot un convincing...all wrong, boring scenes, and probly from an ex-xxxx DPO"
5,W. C. Fields is a great comedian!,"This set is good. Most of the movies are masterpieces. I love THE BANK DICK and IT'S A GIFT the most. They should release all five of these movies separtly. Next they should release IF I HAD A MILLION, MILLION DOLLAR LEGS, NEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK, POPPY, and YOU'RE TELLING ME! separtly. And if they can, release some of his silent movies, too. Those would be interesting to see, because a lot of his talking movies were based on his silent movies. Then they should release all the rest of his movies separtly. He was great."
5,Agreed,I agree with the other comments too. It is well worthwhile getting but where oh where is 'Never Give a Sucker'?
3,One for five,"Yes, _It's a Gift_ is a great film. But everything else in this package is Fields at his second- or third-best. Of course Fields isn't as easy to package as the Marx Brothers, about whom you really can say that all their Paramount films are good and most of their MGM films are bad. Still: how about _The Man on the Flying Trapeze_? And if you're going to package _It's a Gift_, why not include _It's the Old Army Game_? That's an early silent version of _It's a Gift_, remarkable for co-starring Louise Brooks."
5,W.C. Fields Comedy Collection,"W.C, Fields is a comedy legend and this collection is the primer for first-timers looking for an introduction to his wit and wisdom as well as a 'must have' for ardent fans. From ""It' A Gift"" to ""The Bank Dick"" to ""My Little Chickadee"" with equally legendary Mae West, Fields brings us into his world of bumbling husbands, overbearing wives, children bent on destruction and all-out chicanery and highjinx. For comedy fans, there's slapstick, double-entendre jokes and plenty of classic vaudeville humor as well as a study of life in simpler (and arguably funnier) times as seen through a truly unique comedian and filmmaker."
4,"Great stuff, but where are the Paramounts??","These are fine movies, and worth owning (well, maybe not ""International House""), but where, oh where are ""Tillie and Gus"", ""Million Dollar Legs"", and the quintessential Fields movie, ""The Old Fashioned Way""?? Now that ""The High and The Mighty"" is out on DVD, The Old Fashioned Way and Porgy and Bess top my list of ""Films They Won't Reissue""."
5,W. C. Fields DVD Comedy Collection,Excellent reproduction of movies dating from the 1930's and 1940's by one of the greatest comic genius of all time.
4,W.C. Fields box set,"Yes its way past time for Fields films to be on DVD (i do have Big broadcast of 1938 on DVD) the content of this set should have started with his older films from 1932-1936 but im glad to see any on DVD, in responce to another review ""International House"" is a fime movie even when Fields is not on screen i think the worst film on this set is ""My Little Chickadee"" it is one of his weakest films. i have ALL of his films on VHS (most recorded off air years ago) i hope soon i can replace them all with DVDs! (but im not holding my breath) i'd love to see on DVD the films he has cameos/small parts ect in too like Alice In Wonderland-1933, If I Had a Mllion-1932, Six of a Kind-1934, Mississippi-1935!!!!!!!. I gave this set 4 stars insted of 5 because of ""My Little Chickadee"" there are many other Fields films more worthy, most would have been a better choice."
5,Perfect!!!,"I've always enjoyed my first mouse pad from Func Industries. The clip idea was such a simple but essential addition. When I wore out my first pad, I went looking for a replacement and I'm very happy with the new 1030 mouse pad."
3,Need to Format,The content is excellent. I like how they present chinese idioms. This workbook contains many disturbing technical errors. The simplified and traditional versions of the passages do not always contain the same characters (certain characters are deleted for no apparent reason). Some of the simplified characters were not simplified properly. There is not enough room to complete answers. The text is too small. It is hard for people learning chinese to learn a particular character when it so small.
2,needs revision,This book is not a credible source for learning. There are many technical errors (simplified characters are not properly simplified) and the translations are often inaccurate. I have been forced to use a dictionary to retranslate some of the vocabulary. The grammar section is not helpful; the language and terms used are difficult to follow. The text is so small that I am unable to discern new characters and learn them.The content covered is fairly good. It is helpful that both forms of writing are included.
2,There's a lot better out there,"Many of the other reviews have covered things well, so I won't add much beyond saying that this book seems to have been made entirely without the student's needs in mind. The grammar introduced is poorly explained, very technical, and often things you'll only use in very specific situations. Much of the vocabulary is obscure and useless in every day conversation. The layout is awful and the illustrations laughable. The only way this might be useful to you is if you are dead-set on learning traditional/simplified characters at the same time. The accompanying workbook, however, is pretty good as it incorporates interesting reading activities.I would recommend the New Practical Chinese Reader over this series combined with a good grammar book like Routledge's Modern Mandarin Chinese Grammar. Don't waste your time on this one; I spent a full academic year working through this book in a fourth-year undergraduate class and feel like I hardly learned anything!"
4,"in-depth, Simplified and Traditional characters","I have used many Chinese language books over the past 10 years of study and this one rates as very good. The chapters are long, so there's a lot of new vocab in each one and many new grammar points with lots of examples. The best feature is that it has both simplified and traditional characters for most dialogues and paragraphs."
2,Not what I expected,"The description states that this has both traditional and simplified characters, but this is only true for the reading passages, not for the workbook exercises. I also expected the 2nd edition which is about twice as long as this edition and easier to read."
4,Integrated Chinese level 2 textbook,I like the book because it has the two different versions of character. It gives one the benefit to learn both and can compare the difference. The content is quite practical and good for those who plan to study abroad in an Asian country.
1,Outdated editions,"I ordered this book as one of my course texts. After receiving it I learned that it had been superseded by the 2nd edition (ISBN:0887274811). I asked Amazon to exchange it for the new edition, but they sent me another copy of the 1st edition! Now they tell me they can't supply the 2nd edition, although you can find it on their site by searching with the ISBN. So I have had to order a copy direct from the publisher (Cheng & Tsui). There is also a 2nd edition of the Level 2 textbook."
1,Not the best deal,"I do not own this product, but I do own Artur Rubinsteins Chopin Collection. It is currently 22 dollars NEW on Amazon and you could probably buy it used for the same price as this set.The Chopin Collection is ELEVEN discs and not only includes ALL of the pieces in this set but 7 polonaises and over 50 Mazurkas: both are forms of Polish national dances that defined who Chopin was. It also includes the 3 Scherzos (2 of which are incredible, to my opinion), 2 Piano Sonatas, and 6 or so Miscellaneous pieces including the famous ""Fantasie in F minor""My point is that for a few extra dollars you can get at least twice the music. Not to mention that The Chopin Collection is all played by Artur Rubinstein: a world class pianist famous specifically for his interpretations of Chopin.The link to his set is located below.The Chopin Collection"
5,Great Album,"I bought this Album without any knowledge of the artist or the musicians in it. After listening to the first songs I noticed this was not the usual debut album from a newcomer so I read who the musicians involved in the recording were and I was completely impressed of all the talent in it. Some of this musicians are Latin Jazz greats like Gonzalez, Carrillo. The best feature of this cd is the variety of music styles, it goes from Carlos Vives style, to Manu Chao, and then from Tony Bennet to Robi Draco and some Ismael Rivera. I guess this mix of styles will be Nava's style. Hopefully he will keep it that way and will not go mainstream. I believe that this cd is somehow experimental, a style that is in need of more developmenti in the spanish music(rock) scene."
4,Read this!,"I first heard Rodolpho Barrera on a music magazine format called ""College Music Journal"" and really enjoyed the one song featured. It was ""Amores Los Tres"" and it really grabbed my attention. I ordered the album online,not being able to find it locally in Florida and absolutely loved it. Lots of fun, all the way from the ballads to the hot ""Hey You"" at the end. I thoroughly recomend it to all my friends, Latins or not!!"
3,Skyscraper ball track,"This is part of a great set of blocks, but the marbles tended to get stuck and not move through the skyscraper. I don't know if it is slightly off kilter, or what, but we often have to jog it a bit, or drop another marble to keep it moving."
5,Temple Edition of the Gatering of the Saints in Alaska,"The book was perfect, more of it was in color, some of the new photos actually had pix of my father and grandpa and grandma. This is one of the gifts you find on Amazon, when I am thinking I can't find anything written about my wonderful grandfather and there is this book. It si a lovely book, in lovely condition /thank you Amazon!!@!!"
2,This is a bad dvd.,Please can somebody tell me what happen in this serial. The transfer is so bad I want my money back.
1,I agree it is a almost unwatchable print,"Just to add my comment that the copy is so poor that in some scenes I didn't notice people until they spoke. It's made worse by all the night scene where you can't tell who is who, just black shapes. The music is the same as they used in the ""Clutching Hand"". It's so bad, it's fun."
5,Sometimes you can judge a book (Album) by it's cover!,"One fine day I was looking though the ""just in bin"" of used compact disks at my local music store (Twist & Shout)and came across a compact disk that looked like some sort of ethnic album. The cover was interesting so I decided to listen to the first few seconds of each song on the album just to get a feel for the overall sound of the album. Fascinated by the originality of each individual track I decided to buy the album. I proceed to listen to the entire album when I got home! Wow, this album is trance-like sedative cultural music!!!! Macha- limited edition is the best album I have heard this year!"
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this CD mainly because I thought it would be the most thorough of the available Ciscopress offerings and would help me get used to taking the exams on a PC. In my opinion, this CD is not worth the cost. I found the practice exams had several errors and were not much better than those that ship with the CD included free in the ""CCNA Exam Certification Guide"" by Wendell Odom. At times I had a difficult time distinguishing the practice exams that came free with the book and those that shipped with the CD.I also have issues with having sections on X.21 and Appletalk (as well as EGP routing protocols, etc) when the CCNA exam objectives do not state any need to know them? It's great to know this stuff, but unnecessary for this exam.I took, and passed, the CCNA and hardly used this CD. I ended up buying and using the Odom book as my primary prep tool.Just my opinion."
2,Weak Bottom,"I bought this thinking it'd be sleek and decently useful. And, I bought this for my 15"" MacBook Pro.But I regret my decision, to have bought this, without checking out at the local store.Problem is while the inner sides of the bag has small-baloon like cushion, the bottom of the bag just doesn't have anything. Its just one thin layer of neoprene.When the laptop is placed hard, it takes full beating."
3,Definitely Lightweight,"I was looking for a lightweight case to lug my laptop back & forth to work everyday and this definitely fits the bill...it's very light and fits my laptop perfectly. My laptop requires a battery pack for use when I'm out of the office and there's enough room to squeeze that in there as well. The only feature I wish it had was a removable shoulder strap. It's a great case for the money!Sturdy, attractive, protective and lightweight. It was everything I was looking for!"
4,Replaces my homemade sleeve...,"This case replaces my homemade case that I used for well over a year. I've shied away from most cases since I'm uncertain they really offer the amount of padding I want, and although this one still doesn't offer a lot of padding along the edges and corners it will work for me. This case is also large enough to fit accessories -- charger, laptop mouse, plus some other small items -- in addition to offering a comfortable fit for my over-sized battery (I think it is a 9-cell).* Simple case.* Well priced.* Fits accessories.* Insufficient padding on edges/corners.Overall happy with the product but I will eventually add some additional padding in on my own."
4,Second time buying this product!,"This is the second Microsoft case I purchased. The construction is like no other, I have not seen a sleeve that is as strong or durable as this one. Flying with a computer in the case is easy and your computer is always secure. My only problem was that the case was a little big for my 15.4 inch computer, but that is not the sleeve's fault."
4,"Nice sleeve, protects very well.","Perfect fit for my 14"" Thinkpad. I like how it is padded and the protection it offers. Only change I would make would be to have a pouch or pocket for the charger. All in all though, the best I found available, and I'm happy with it."
5,Work in Progress,Fits my Mac PowerBook great and it fits easily inside my newly purchased Targus laptop case or I can easily use it alone. Just what I wanted!
4,Well padded,"The only reason this gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because is does not have a pocket to carry the cord. It is well padded & a great size for the 14"" laptop I purchased."
2,Warning! Weak Bottom!,"I bought this about six months ago. Loved it. Used it just about every day. But now it is about to be junked, as the bottom is just a layer of thin neoprene with no support, and my computer is starting to fall through. There are strong webbing straps down from the handle -- but they stop just before the bottom, where the weight of the computer rests! There is strong orange piping around the sides -- but NOT under the bottom. It would have been so easy for the webbing to extend one more inch, and carry the weight of the computer. I can't understand why they built it this way. Very sad. But six months is not good enough for me, durability wise. I will be replacing it with another brand."
5,Exactly what I needed!,"I was at Best Buy and happened to see comparable products, but with no handle selling for $30 bucks. I decided to check out Amazon and order this one with handles. I wanted the ability to put it in my backpack or carry my laptop on its own. It's perfect! The handles are flexible, so I fold them to the side before slipping it into my backpack."
5,Great carrying case,"This slim computer sleeve is great for when you don't need a full laptop carrying case. It fits my HP laptop just fine, and can easily be placed inside a larger tote bag."
4,Good Read,"Needed this book for a class but we didn't use it as often as we could've. All in all, the essays we did read out of it were very interesting, and organized well."
1,A Muslim Commentary,A Muslim has taken some of her words and then used a few of them to support his religion. I do not recommend this book to anyone! Read the complete book by Rose Wilder Lane elsewhere! This is NOT her book.
3,Islam & the discovery of Freedomf,"A brief and concise eye opener of the history of Islamic expansion, influence and its relationship to the recent times. A very good book for policy makers, televangelists, ordinary people with extraordinary hatred for Islam and Moslems. The book also helps the new and young generation of Americans who have been under the influences of the biassed media."
4,INDUSTRIAL POP !!!!,"Another nice album by this master of the genre.Similar to Berserker in style only Berserker is a better listen.This is a weird mix of industrial machine drums and bass and funky elements,with female backing vocals and a certain Prince air to some of the songs.Heavily and very personal and processed vocals add the final touch.What I found the most appealing,though,were the incredible bonus tracks (last 5 songs).Incredibly dark,obscure,sombre,moody industrial songs taken from singles released the same year as the album,which could have marked the direction he was to follow from his Sacrifice album on.Instead,he continued with a string of good albums in this and similar veins.Advice: tthe bonus tracks alone are worth the price of the abum"
1,the fury -gary numan,"without a shadow of doubt his weakest album , the previous 3 being superb, it all went a bit pear shaped here. only extended versions of ""creatures"" and ""tricks"" delivering the goods. an album to miss."
2,"Interesting, but flawed","A so-so introduction to design principles, marred by a misleading typography chapter. Simply put, Ms. Goodman's use of terminology is often wrong: for example, she uses the term Modern as a label for all sans-serifs, then classifies Bodoni as a Transitional; she calls Optima and Gill Sans Grotesques "" they're not "", and, most galling, she manages to get the definitions of ""font"" and ""typeface"" exactly backwards. Mere details? Perhaps, but one can easily make the argument that typography is about details. As far as the rest of the book is concerned, though it has some nice examples, the layout makes it difficult to use as a reference, and the text fails to provide much of a historical context. It is also almost exclusively American."
1,Terrible Book! Layout was horrible!,"I'll start off with the only compliment I can muster up: the content is 'alright.' Besides mediocre content, this book is terrible!The layout is horrible and the typography is a perfect textbook example of how NOT to write a design book. This book is on the essentials of Graphic Design and its obvious, by the author's lack of understanding of typography, that she does NOT have a firm grasp on them.Please please please find a better book on graphic design essentials, but if you must read this one, check it out from a library first."
1,if you are over 40 don't buy this book,"I've had this book since close to the time it was originally published in 2001, but had never read it. Now I'm embarking on a project for which I need this type of information, so I dug the book out of its box and attempted to read it. Then I realized why I'd never gotten past the first few pages. The type of the main text throughout the book is extremely small, maybe 7 point! What is the purpose of that? It's not that the book was so crammed full of information that she couldn't fit in larger type; she must have thought it was really cute to use the tiny type with three blank lines between each typed line to achieve that all that all-important white space!Ms. Goodman could stand to learn an 8th design element: i.e., make the design user friendly. I forced myself to read through the book, skipping over a lot because of eyestrain, but now that I've finished, it's going directly to a used book store."
5,Huntsville Heritage Cookbook,This cookbook has a great recipe for sweet potatoes! My mom has had a copy for quite some time. Before getting married I purchased my own copy. It is a great cookbook to have.
4,Kolinsky Sable 1 Flat Watercolor Brush,"I wasn't sure what a #14 brush was as mentioned in the Product Description.So, I went to the FineArtStore Web site & found this item advertised there as a 1"" brush. What I received was a 3/4"".But I am pleased to say they corrected the mistake immediately and with no hassle at all.I am slightly less pleased that the 1"" brush I received was only 15/16"" long. There is no mention in the Product Description about length so I guess I have nothing to complain about. I had expected something closer to 1"" x 1-1/4"" though."
4,don't pay attention to the picture--read the text,"The picture of this product is NOT accurate--it is a flat brush, not a round as shown so don't get confused about what you are buying. Brush holds a lot of paint. Bristles tend to separate as paint is discharged, which may be something you want, or not."
3,I want to use this!,"This looks like a great product. I ordered it twice now and had to return it both times because when I opened the shipping box the stone was completely broken, and had dust all over. It wasn't even a clean break. Can we put a ""Fragile"" sticker on this little guy please? Hoping the third time is the charm..."
3,Arrived chipped,"Arrived broken into two main pieces. Works very well, but it would work better if there wasn't a one-inch chunk missing from the waterstone."
1,"poorly packaged, cracked on arrival","I just received this item and it was so poorly padded, that it was cracked all the way through on both ends where they failed to pad it. I can hardly see being able to use it in its condition. i gave this a low rating purely for the reason that it was poorly protected and broken on arrival."
5,Good Product Great Service,"This is just what my husband wanted. It works well, and is very durable.The company is really great too, we had to re-route the package and without there help and patience with me it would have never happened. Thank you for the great service."
3,I expected the stones to be larger in size,"The value on this product is satisfactory, however I expected the stones to be larger. I have not used them yet, so it is somewhat difficult to review the quality of the stones."
2,Sent me a chipped stone,The stone arrives with a big chunk broken. It works fine to sharpen but I wasnt very happy about receiving a broken product.
2,36% less stone than you paid for,"The stone is significantly smaller than advertised. A smaller stone is harder to sharpen on, and because waterstones wear out, the volume of the stone determines how long it will last.Amazon description claimed size: 2.5"" x 8.4"" x 1.2"" = 25.2 cubic inchesActual size: 2"" x 8.125"" x 1"" = 16.25 cubic inchesSo, you're getting screwed to the tune of ((25.2 - 16.25) / 25.2) * 100 = 35.51%I'm not amused. It's going back to Amazon at their expense."
3,The 1000 (red stone) crumbles,"I got this for $58 on amazon. The main problem is the 1000 grit. It breaks off in small chunks and pits the surface. Instead of slurry it's like sand and water. The 6000 works great. So, all-in-all I got a more expensive 6000 grit than I wanted. The dimensions are wrong as well it's 2"" wide (across). The best and most inexpensive synthetic water stone I've used is the King combination 800x 4000 sold on amazon. The poor 1000 grit makes this a no go. I wouldn't recommend this for that reason. Maybe it's just the one that I received and has been sitting on a shelf for years."
4,Good starter stone,"If you're looking for the ultimate sharpening system, this isn't it. If you're looking for an inexpensive but serviceable water stone set to learn hand sharpening, then it doesn't get much better. The bang for your buck is hard to beat.1000/6000 is a good combination for knives that need a basic tune-up (I have used this to put a wicked edge on everything from a 2.5"" Swiss army knife to my 8"" Wusthof). The grit selection is a compromise when it comes to other tasks, though - 1000 is perhaps a little too fine (slow) for re-tipping or re-beveling, and 6000 is too rough to get a surgical sharp edge like you might need on a straight razor."
4,Pretty good waterstone for the price.,"This waterstone works great for getting a mirror polish on any plane irons, chisels, or even just pocket knives or cutlery I would bet (only used it on plane iron myself). The only downside to these waterstone is that it can be worn down slightly in areas of the surface that are worked more. You generally don't want this because it gets in the way of keeping that true and flat surface that is the whole concept of the waterstone or sharpening stone. However on the upside to that, re-trueing the waterstones surface is possible by sanding a high grit (but not too high) sanding block. Make sure that sanding block is true itself though!"
4,Pretty good and great instructions,"It was effective and note that the stone will wear down as you grind on it, but it is normal and to keep adding water as you sharpen your blade on first the 1000 side and then finish off on the 6000 side. I noticed it helps to work on each side of the blade for over 5 minutes. Much cheaper than taking it done professional. A few practices make perfect! This is my first sharpening stone and I pretty happy with it. Ooh, it does make a skin crawling noise, to be expected, I had to put my iPod on!"
3,"Good book, but some complicated concepts and vocabulary","This is a nice book that I am currently half-way through. While I really enjoy the book, I think the vocabulary used might be challenging for some readers. Sometimes the vocabulary makes simple concepts seem more complex than they really are. Otherwise, it is an interesting read."
2,Boring,"Did I read the wrong book. Other reviewers called this book, Sensual, Erotic and a great love story. No No No - It was Boring I tell you. Mrs. Ranney what were you thinking. I could'nt wait for it to be over. The characters had no chemistry, no cute sparring back and forth no witty comebacks, no passion. The only scene they had was the ribbon scene, and that left me a little confused. In the books I read I like Passion, Good Sex but not always and above all a great love story. She just fell flat on all accounts."
5,SLOW BURN...,"This was my first novel by Karen Ranney. Her writing syle ""savors"" every word. She doesn't waste time telling the reader things you can figure out on your own. She saves the detail for when the reader wants it the most...for the sex. The story starts out with a fire that changes Margaret's life. Yet the flames keep erupting from the pages as her relationship with Michael simmers, sizzles, and boils...even to the last word. I love Margaret's ""comfortable with myself"" attitude. I love Michael's fascination with Margaret. I especially love how their relationship continually moves forward despite outside conflict. Sensuality = 10. Sexuality = 10. Burn, baby, burn..."
5,This writter is tomorrows superstar in the romance genre,AFTER THE KISS is a powerful Regency romantic mystery filled with more twists and turns than found in a private investigator novel. The technique of realistic surprises will please fans of historical mysteries as well as those who enjoy an ardent romance. The lead couple is charming and the villain is despicable even as he stays just outside the sight of the reader. Karen Ranney provides the sub-genre audience and a wider audience with a superb tale of suspense that will bring the author a new cadre of fans.Harriet Klausner
2,Don't drive yourself mad.,"I got this book to find ways to support my body during chemotherapy. I came away feeling like I was going to die unless I ate blended salads and goat's milk every day and chased down a bunch a of random supplements. And I'm a very ""natural food""-type of person who usually doesn't think much of going the extra mile to seek out complementary or alternative care. I'm not saying there aren't some good tips in the book, but it is really hard to weed through all the advice to find what you need. The author does quote many studies, but many of them only used animals as subjects, not people, so he's not always presenting conclusive evidence. The best thing you can do is rest, eat a well-balanced diet and find ways to support your spirit during this tough time. Stay away from anything that makes you feel fear."
2,This book is to extreme,"Some of the advice does make since. But, this book goes way over the top. You might as well live in a bubble and only eat kale and supplements. The main thing for cancer victims is to eat healthy and eat things in moderation. Kind of like you should anyway. Eat the good fats (omega 3), eat less sugar, eat more vegetables, and stay away from red meat. If that is what you got out of the book then great. But all the rambling of all the supplements is confusing, and not well organized. And maybe a recipe to give an example of proper nutrition would help."
1,the guy is a quack,"Really??? People think that this guy helps tremendously with cancer? If that were true, then it would be all over the news and a HUGE deal. And, just FYI, it is not all over the news. Look at his credentials--nothing reputable. I'm shocked at how many people will be led by someone like this."
5,added information,I am always looking for more info. on this topic. This was more fuel to stop the growth in certain types of cancers.
3,Lighter duty than I expected,The backboard is pretty flimsy and flexes a lot when you bank a ball off it. Our backboard is warped from new but hasn't gotten any worse since we started to use it. I would recommend spending the extra money to get one with a solid backboard.
3,Love and frustration,"This recording has some wonderful Scottish songs by a super Scottish tenor. The difficult part for me is that I need the sheet music to go with one of the songs, but I had no luck locating it anywhere. There are other versions of the song (""My heart's in the highlands"") available but none like this one. Is there any chance you could help me find it??Sincerely,Lyndall"
5,PVD's best album,This album is by far the best album of PVD's entire collection. Its amazing sound is great if you just want to throw a cd in and play it at a party. If you have any House or Trance album in your collection this should be it.
3,Best song isn't even his........,"FYI, for all the little ravers. The song ""Alive"" is NOT, I repeat, NOT a PVD original. It's by Jennifer Brown. What happened to Paul?"
3,Trance...more like unconscious...,"Well I am a huge Nicholas Bennison fan (who is also a phat Trance DJ) so I was told to check out this new album by Paul Van Dyk but I was sadly dissapointed. At least compared to the trance that I usually listen to, it was just not what i was expecting. However, if you are truly a big trance fan, then you'll prolly find a couple of songs you can dig on this album..."
2,"Nice, but old hat","I bought this the other day and I enjoy it, especially in the car. However, if someone had played it for me without my having heard it before, and then asked me to guess who made the album and when, I would say it was a Jean-Michel Jarre album from the 1970's. There is nothing new, revolutionary, or cutting-edge about Van Dyk's music; I have been listening to the same thing on vinyl by Jarre for 25 years. (Try Oxygene).Although this CD is pleasant, it reminds me of a cover album."
2,Disappointing,"This album is the most disappointing CD I have ever gotten. PVD sets the drum machine to thump thump thump ... and doesn't touch it until it's time to shut it off. One song of this is monotonous, after 2 hours it's quite annoying. On top of that monotonous thump is a narrow stream of notes that in itself is well done but there is no composition."
4,Van Dyk has done it again,"In this, his latest release, Paul Van Dyk has once again redefined electronic music. This collection of mixes will go down someday as classics"
5,Typical Van Dyk perfection,"I really enjoyed this CD after purchasing the Another Way/Avenue and Tell Me Why singles in anticipation of this album and to cure my PVD fix. He's just as good as ever. The album is created in typical PVD fashion as far as Seven Ways is concerned. The first CD is mixed all the way through and the second is the remix CD. This time the second CD is also enhanced and comes with the videos for Tell Me Why and Another Way. Aside from the two hyped up aforementioned singles, two other tracks stood out to me as being very HQ, high quality. Pikes, which just seems to be an Oakenfold-esque song and the Christopher Lawrence/Sandra Collins-esque song in Avenue. After reading this don't think on it, just go buy, you won't regret it. It's two CDs for the actual price of 1 CD. It's the PVD value that you also have to consider! Later."
2,too commercialized???,"the first few songs on this album get it going but then it drops off dramatically. The songs seem too similar and don't flow like pauls previous albums.As a fan of PVD, this seems like he is going more commercial instead of sticking with the basics. I think that Vorsprung Dyk Technik is still his best album, too bad it is out of print, if it ever becomes available again, grab it."
4,A Full Sound...which is saying a lot,"I think Paul Van Dyk has accomplished with this album what other trance artists only attempt, a full sound. Each song on the album has what I look for in electronic dance music, a solid beat with ample bass to back it up, and a light, but not cheesy, melody to give the song its character.Most of the stuff I've heard recently just hasn't had the sound i've been looking for. I prefer to see all the levels on the equalizer peaking when the song is at its climax, not just the treble, and unfortunately that's what a lot of producers have been recently...producing. There just hasn't been anything serious enough for me to listen to on a regular basis. But ""Out There and Back"" has definitely brought me back to trance after a long vacation. I highly recommend it for the raver who's looking for a little more weight in their electronica."
3,"Nice try, but not close at all","Paul Van Dyk is probably one of the most talented people in the world of trance. ""Seven Ways"" had great moments on the dance floor and in your head phones at home.For me, he became the most likely candidate to make the perfect conceptual trance record that contained depth, character and stood up to repeated listens at home. I felt that PVD could blow Union Jack's pretentious but great ""There Will Be No Armageddon"" out to the water.Well Paul. Nice try but you fell way short of the mark. Kudos for teaming up with Saint Etienne but shame on you for leaving the collaborative version of the record.Out There And Back has some great ideas. However, PVD has some generally weak songs and things become very monotonous after a while.Still I am more than sure that PVD will make the before mentioned pivotal trance recording. He just might have to collaborate with a few people to pull it off.end kdc"
4,AMAZING!,This album is as described above. AMAZING! Paul van dyke has done it again with a wicked blend of trance ane house that will keep you moving in to the wee hours.
3,Awesome individual tracks...somewhat average album,"It absolutely pains me to give PvD a 3 star rating, but to be completely honest this effort doesn't match ""Seven Ways"" or ""45 rpm"" in terms of continuity throughout the album. The first CD is for the most part an assembly of individual tracks, and although some of them are quite good, especially ""Another Way"" and ""Tell me why"", most of the rest isn't as gripping as some of his previous efforts were.There are other tracks on the album that may grow on you as you listen to them more and more, but the real main events are the singles I just mentioned, both on the first disc and on the b-side, second disc.""Tell me why"", among a couple other singles, definitely add to PvD's reputation as a fantastic songwriter, and ""Tell me why"" has made its way to numerous remix tables and compilation albums. Although I gave this album 3 stars, it definitely does not mean PvD has passed his prime or has the ""Real McCoy"" syndrome."
5,Splendid listening,"This album from Paul Van Dyk is so much better than 45 RPM. It is full, complex, and just wonderous. 45 RPM, in my opinion, was rough and lacking of an overall feeling, but listening to Out There And Back is so much better and so much more enjoyable. The best thing about it is it is a continuous sequence, but there are noticeable song breaks which allow for nice mixing. Great melody, beats, and sound progression whole-heartedly earn this CD 5 stars."
3,"Old songs, cheesy sound...","With all due respect to PVD (I have not missed a single performance since he has become a resident at Twilo), I must say that ""Out there and back"" is a rather disappointing CD. If you are a hard-core, trance-loving clubhead, this compilation is not for you. ""Out there and back"" targets people not so familiar with the REAL trance sound. Even though most songs on the CD have already become anthems, they are mixed in a very ""commercial"" way. If you want to enjoy the true PVD sound, try downloading his actual sets or, better yet, go see him live. He is, by far, the best DJ out there."
2,Not exactly ground-breaking...,"OK, so yeah it's PvD commercial trance and it's good - for about the first few times you hear it (after that most of the tracks loose their charm, the one's that HAD some...)I'll admit that I only bought the album for Pikes and Namistai (Namistai being a nightmare to get hold of on vinyl) as they truly are great tracks, but I was well dissapointed with the rest - the words Cliched, Laboured and Un-original come to mind.Basically if you like PvD then you'll love this album and give it 5 stars, if on the other hand you're sick of things like 'your granny singing trance tunes she's heard on the radio' and you realise how EASY it is to produce commercial trance then don't bother."
5,Van Dyk Is God!!!,"Trance's best DJ!! Paul Unlike most other djs, he can compose his own tracks and bring a level of energy unmatched by all. A must have for any Trance fan. If you love music that flows throughout the soul and moves you to the point of pure bliss, buy this cd!!!!"
5,Even for ordinary people....,"Hi ! I do not consider myself a ""raver"", and I'm also not a club addict, but I really enjoy electronic music and , of cource TRANCE music. If you were to buy only one TRANCE album in your life, search no more... New style along with retro 90's trance style all come together... It's some kind of a tribute album to trance ! Buy it,close your eyes (unless your in the car !) and enjoy ! Eric a.k.a ""Your everyday ordinary guy !"""
4,"Great CD, but knowing Van Dyk, it is not his best","I bought this CD just 4 days ago and I've listened to it continuously for hours on end. You will not be bored of this CD...EVER. Another great CD from an absolutely amazing artist. For the money I paid I was given a LOT, which is normal with any 2 disc Van Dyk set. Although I am very pleased with my purchase, I know Paul van Dyk and I know this is not his best. Compared to Politics of Dancing or even Seven Ways this CD lags a bit with a few slow tracks to start you off. If you buy this be sure to buy his CD Politics of Dancing."
5,The master of trance shows,"Paul van dyk here shows us why he's been hailed as one of the greatest DJ's ever with this LP. From the wonderful opening bars of Vega to the true anthem that is Avenue. This album shows us what true clubbing is about. Unlike the editors view, of falling behind ATB this album kicks atb's [rear]... Paul van dyk's tunes on the other hand rocked clubbs when it was released and still can today. A classic."
5,wow...,"About a year ago, I discovered the amazing music of Chicane. I thought I would never find anything as unique, relaxing and enjoyable to listen to again. I was wrong. A friend introduced me to the music of Paul van Dyk - suggested this new CD ""Out there and Back"". I wish I had bought it sooner. While the music of Paul van Dyk is not as ambient and 'make you peacefully fall asleep' as Chicane, his music has that same surreal and euphoric quality to it. I have seen other people in these reviews raving about track 7 on the second CD - ""Face to Face"". I gonna have to back them up. I have never heard piano mixed with techno before, but somehow van Dyk did... and it is a beautiful track. Buy this CD."
5,An awesome album,"I just bought this a few days ago and it is really great. One of the reasons that I picked this double cd up is, because of Avenue, which, I have from the PSX game cd Wipeout 3. It is a great song and I knew if the others were as good as this one it would be awesome. Well I wasn't disappointed. Most of the songs are excellent, especially Another Way, both versions. As a bonus on disc 2 there are 2 PvD videos, Tell Me Why and Another Way, which, I thought was a great bonus. If you like any of PvD's earlier stuff you should definately pick this great double cd up."
5,Two CDs of drop-dead gorgeous tracks,"Not only is PVD an excellent DJ to hear live, but he has also recreated that experience perfectly on Out there and Back. Every song has purpose and meaning, and follows his style, yet each is inherently different. If you want to read why he wrote the songs or what influenced him, see the June issue of DJ magazine. The song ""Together we will conquer"" was written by him and his wife, and is one of the most beautiful songs of the set. (a remix on the second cd is equally as beautiful). The second disc also contains two videos...one for The Riddle, and the other for Another Way. Oakenfold fans beware, PVD is more subtle with his mixing and you should not expect two CDs full of anthems. It is amazing that this man could create music of the same caliber that he plays. This is perhaps his most emotionally moving work to date."
5,Should be titled Progression...,"WOW! That's what can be used to describe this album...it will make you believe in ""trance"" again...even though it's not really a ""trance"" album, because it's by PvD, many people will label it that...PvD mixes in drum 'n' bass, house, and some plain euro-trance (different from the LA trance I'm used to) to compile the best album of the year so far...it has not left my CD player since I bought it...PvD has done his best to lose the ""trance"" label that has been applied to him, and this album will help his case...it's much more versatile then ""Seven Ways"", and much more enjoyable personally...so basically, ya, go buy it now, whether you like ""trance"" or not, if you like electronic music, you will like this cd..."
5,Is this even possible?,"How can this cd be so damn good? Wait, no, I take that back. How can Paul van Dyk be so good at what he does? This is one of the most moving cd's I have ever been able to listen to in my life. This cd is definitely not something I can just pop into my stereo for a little background music. As a matter of fact, there are ONLY 2 things that I can do while this is playing: 1) turn off the lights, crank up the volume, close my eyes and be carried away by the wave of music, or 2) get up and dance to the beat! If you won't do either with this album, then you are wasting your time. Every song is a gem that requires special attention. The mixing is excellent, as to be expected, and adds a nice touch to the album. If cd's could wear out like records can, my copy would definitely be ruined by now. This is not trance as most people have come to know it. It is unique, it is unbelievable, it is mind blowing, it is the unmistakable genius of PvD."
4,"out there, not back yet","Fans of Paul Van Dyk would not be disappointed with this release. Here is the master at what he is best known for- melodic Eurotrance, that he has perfected throughout the 90's. As Vega moves on to the superb Pikes, one begins to reckon the start of something real big, with the pumped-up melody and energetic syncopation. Another Way and Travelling continue the momentum and then comes the superb track with St. Etienne- Tell Me Why, which alone is worthy of praise. Unfortunately, the tracks that follow don't sustain the surge of the initial lift-off. As one track flows into the next, still with the same hypnotic fervor, one is left with a feeling of being just one step shy of the ultimate high. A definitive must-have for fans of Van Dyk, expect to be taken out there, coming back may be a problem.."
5,"Seamless, Sensational Mixes By The God of Trance","I think that Paul van Dyk Has produced some very Cool tunes. I think that the biggest tunes on the cd are Out there and back, We are Alive, Tell Me Why, And Another way. Personally I have bought the cd myself And I think every track is superb but I'm thinking more along the lines of the publics choice. Out There and Back has a very melodic melody, it's an uplifting, light and bouncy tune, same applies to We Are Alive. But The other tunes I mentioned have gone very commercial. I also have bought it On vinyl as I am a DJ. Whoever Buys this album has definately spent there Money wisely Well done Paul Van Dyk"
3,I must be too old...,"This CD set would be perfect in only one of two situations. 1) You want to throw a party and you need a premixed CD with the loops built in, or 2)you listen to the first CD (since the second is remixes and a video) two songs at a time, leaving at least a day in between sittings. Sure, the melodies are nice, gentle and listenable - but they only last a few bars apiece, and are repeated ad nauseum over the same four-on-the-floor beat. No subtlety, no variance, just establish beat, cue in effects, and bliss out to the melody of the minute. That makes a song here. I must be getting old. I guess too much past 30, and the ""ten songs looped together as one"" concept just looses its appeal. Not that there aren't moments, mind you - but after five straight songs, they all just blend together and kinda get to sounding the same. Maybe that's the point?"
2,Nothing special,"I bought this CD based on reviews. I loved his album ""Reflections"" so I thought I'd give PvD another try. However, I was disappointed. Half of the songs are the same...just remixes. There's nothing that grabs you into the music. It's just constant beats with little effects. Theres no ENERGY!!! Just mellow beats.""Another Way"" is the only song I really enjoyed."
5,our man flint,this is and has been a favorite since i first saw it as a teenager it was great then and is still great now.as a blueray definately worth the money.
1,I expected something better,"Alejandro Fernadez has a nice powerfull voice. I love his mariachi albums. His ealier pop cds were not too bad, but this one is very disappointing. He does not sing to his potential, the material selected is boring, the duet with that female pop singer is horrible. It looks that Alejandro tries too hard to conquer the crowd of teenagers."
3,ok,Alejandro's new cd is just another cd. Just a few songs are good enough. He can do better than this.
2,Not Alejandro's style,"Love the hit song ""Te voy a perder"" and the song with Beyonce', but the rest of the songs are okay. Kinda boring. They are not Alejandro's style of music. I love Alejandro soooooo much I dream of him. I listen to his concert in Spain CD three to four times a week and watch his DVD very often. He's my idol. I love his other cd's also ""Corazon Abierto"" and his Mariachi CD's. He's awesome! This new cd of his, just isn't his style. I believe he's trying to get into the pop scene, but he's better with his balads and Mariachi music. If you want to listen to it, I suggest buying a used one instead and save your money.Ale, you can come to my home anytime for dinner and ??!Ale's big FAN!"
1,Ridiculous indeed,"I too feel this is a majorly flawed performance of the works represented. The playing is rushed, has no sense of musical line or style, is outside the bounds of good musical taste, and is loaded with mistakes galore. If you are interested in hearing an accurate, musically aware performance, do not purchase this recording."
5,A must have resource,This book is a must have for all TBI caregivers. It is a great reference and written in such away that anyone can understand what to expect after a child or adult has a TBI.
5,The Beautiful Singing of Ms. McGovern should never end,"This CD is one of the most beautiful CDs I have ever heard in my life. Ms. McGovern has a voice that would make most hearts melt! It is an unparalleled joy listening to her, especially on such soundtracks as The Summer Knows and Make Me Rainbows which is heartbreakingly beautiful. Any fans of Ms. McGoverns work and movies in general will wan to pick up this beautiful CD released by Fynsworth Alley. And here is the most moving all of reasons to buy this CD- Miss McGovern will be donating 50% of her royalties on this CD to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. A classy CD for an extremely classy lady."
5,A Delight to my Historical Senses,"I have just finished reading Gale's book, and I say that with much sadness, because I have enjoyed it so much I didn't want it to finish. I work in the field of climate change, so I make to my business to keep up-to-date. Gale is certainly accurate. His historical approach is also quite delightful - if only other historians had such an easy touch. His story of how we came to use fossil fuels and how we came to understand their impact on our atmosphere is fascinating, rich, full of intriguing detail, and from my viewpoint, very well researched. There is nothing hysterical about this book - just honest, insightful, delightful reporting. I might just read it all over again !"
3,Bias?,"If Jack from Pittburgh realized that Gale was a he, not a she, would he still call the book 'hysterical'?"
2,Fragile conclusions,"The authors clearly care a great deal about how children are educated and evaluated. However, the conclusions that are drawn go too far. While these are steeped in much current literary theory, that theory itself is still very speculative with little firm research to support it. Furthermore, although the book roundly condems most current types of reading tests, no promising alternatives are put forth. The main mission of Fragile Evidence is not to reform standardized reading tests or tackle the difficult task of improving them, but rather to just get rid of them altogether. Still, there are a number of good points raised about test validity, reliability, and perhaps most importantly the poor uses to which tests are put."
5,Great book!,"Niamh and the Hermit--great literary quality, excellent morals, well-drawn characters, and a gripping plot. I'm not normally a big fan of romance, but this is a book where it's done right. Get out there (or stay in here) and buy a copy--you won't disappointed. (Maybe I'll write something longer later...)Sean T. M. Stiennon"
5,dazzling book,I couldn't stop reading. The characters were very easy to understand and the plot was exciting with many twists. Particularly interesting were the maps and drawings throughout and even on both covers. Oh oh and sheet music too. But the story itself carries you into a wonderful world that is mysterious and dazzling all at the same time.QUALITY READ!!
1,Not so easy W's,"This mold is the worst for making letters. The imprint of the letter isn't raised so there is no way to fill in the letter with an accent color then pour the main color. We tried using edible markers and other colorings but there is no way to fill in the letter so our candies will just be plain white, with the W impression. Also, it didn't come with any tips or hints on how to accent the letter, that would have been helpful and probably would've avoided this review."
2,"Ehh, ok, not the best thats for sure",This album was definitly not Zao's best album. Wait till it goes on sale.

2,This the third reanimation of this album,but I am sorry this on is not the best they done. Dan vocals just dont compare to Shawns I am sorry. I love you Dan but shawn rules in the highs.
3,Marie Claire Maison-French Edition,"These magazines are published in different countries such as Italy and France. I did not know that. I wanted to purchase the Italian version and until I received it, did not know that it was also published in French-a bit of a surprise. I did enjoy the magazine though-the pictures were nice. Wish I knew how to get my hands on the Italian version though. Also wish the information was clearly marked when ordering. The writing was too small for me to determine that it was a French, not Italian, magazine I ordered."
3,Thin,"My two year old likes this book much more than I do. That is not all a bad thing, but not quite what I was expecting when I bought it. Basically this book is picture book of critters, bugs, and plants that grow in and around an oak tree... in England. For an American, some of the information will not pertain. The drawings are nice, but each entry could use more scientific information. What does this eat? Does it harm the tree? Etc. It took me about an hour to get through the book, now it lays in my living room where my son grabs it, takes it to me and shows me the bugs and squirrels."
2,mauro bagestero,The CD THAT HERE in BRAZIL HAS the shocking blue???????And more COMPLETE / DOES NOT the same NW JAPAN COME WITH MUSICIANS OF the SHOCKING BLUE??? WILL IT BE WHAT WAS PROHIBITED?? I HUG MAURO
4,Music to nourish the soul with,"I recently purchased this cd after having seen the video for ""Heartbeat"" on MTV-2. At a time when several of my favorite bands have new releases, I have shelved Fuel & Collective Soul and am unable to stop listening to Tahiti 80. I am very impressed with the unique sound this French quartet has developed. A little bit of 70's mixed in with a refreshing 60's sound, this is a keeper. I doubt this cd will ever be found in a used section at a local music store - it's one of those cd's you'll have to pop in the stereo every once in awhile when you are feeling down, the spirit and sound of this music is uplifting to say the least. Favorite songs on my list would include ISAAC, Mr Davies & the title track, Puzzle. I have found a new ""favorite"" band of mine!"
4,"So good, so good...","This record is great. It's that perfect blend of 80s pop and modern sensibilities. It's layered with just the right balance retro synth sounds, live instrumentation, drum loops, compelling vocals and accessible lyrics that only the French seem to be able to do it. In the tradition of MOON SAFARI, PUZZLE is carefree and mysterious all at the same time. But the hooks - the hooks are sooooo catchy - you'll be singing along in no time. The band also gives an incredible live performance (I saw them at the Bowery Ballroom last month). HEARTBEAT is the radio single, but my favourite is YELLOW BUTTERFLY. I love this record."
1,disappointing,...disappointing. nothing like what the review said. sung through a screen door with wind blowing. not at all what i expected. i'm sure a dead person would enjoy it.
3,"Almost there, but not quite","With all the comparisons to Air, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this CD. Unfortunately, to compare Puzzle to either Moon Safari or Premiers Symptoms is really a travesty. Granted, there are some interesting tracks, but Tahiti seems to get lost somewhere along the way, and songs that start out with promising beats or intros never seem to materialize. It's a shame, because, while you can sense the potential of this group, they just never seem to reach expectations. Stick with Air, Morcheeba, Cassius, etc., or go back and explore late 60's early 70's pop. You'll be much happier."
1,Please.,"I bought the album because 'amazon' compared the group to the mellow sounds of 'AIR'. The album is whiney, empty and the lyrics not nearly as clever as the musicians think they are."
3,Algebra,This video are great for someone refreshing their skills in algebra. I good tool for beginners else well as advance. The quizzes and review were good in regurgitating the information. In regards to the dvd the antics were just used to fill space. this portion would have been probably good for teenagers to comprehend. I could have done without it because I just wanted to get to meat of the program. Overall the information was quite effective for me.
2,Must Have Been Written For Pre-Adolescents,"An easy to read book, it tells one nothing of the mechanics of sex, but more the details that one should give to a child. It would make a great book for parents to use with their children or for children in elementary or middle school, but is not for anybody who has started high-school. If you need to know the material here, then you obviously had to have dropped out of school in second grade or are just plain uninterested in the topic."
3,Sex for Dummies (mini),I meant to purchase the larger sized book but found the book to be helpful anyway. A little disappointed by the size but okay with the content...at least it is travel-sized.
1,This is the miniature version...,"I don't see why this product isn't titled ""Sex for Dummies Miniature Edition"". I see that under the description it mentions miniature a few times >.< But still, I was extremely disappointed to have this little thing show up at my door. The cost of return shipping makes it not worth returning either."
2,Don't Buy This,This book is only helpful if you have never had sex before. If you are looking for a guide to help you build more confidence or experience from your current knowledge - THIS IS NOT THAT BOOK.
5,EXCELLENT,I AM A RETIRED ADULT. THIS SUDUKO IS A REPLACEMENT FOR ONE I HAVE HAD FOR 5 YEARS OR MORE. EXCELLENT FOR KEEPING THE MIND GOING. I USE IT A FEW TIMES A DAY AND WHEN WAITING FOR APPOINTMENTS.
5,Working on the third set,"I found the 2nd book (Shadow of the Swan) of the trilogy first and was immediately hooked. I found the first book (Sword of the Lamb) next in a used book store in Dallas ( this was years before Amazon.com) and searched for the third (House of the Wolf) for 3 years. It is the most engrossing and enthralling set of books I have found since the Lord of the Rings. I've worn out two sets and am now wearing out the 3rd. It has adventure, action, romance, morality (and immorality), philosophy, religion and can still be classified as hard sci-fi. Character development is superb and the historical progression into the time of the trilogy is frightingly believable and, given current events, terrifyingly possible. This is a trilogy that needs to be re-printed in hard cover and is appropriate for all but the youngest of readers, both male and female."
3,Guilty pleasures,"When I first read this trilogy, I found it very deeply flawed. The drama was so over-the-top, the posturing of the characters so ludicrous, the general space-operaish feeling so unashamed. It was laughable.And still. I have come back again and again to the trilogy. It has everything: the appeal of the peek into aristocratic life, dashing princes (and even pirates!), beautiful princesses about to be ravished by depraved cowards, tyranny, slavery, a secret society to overthrow them... wow.If M.K. Wren had had a sense of humor and a sense of the ridicolous, she could easily have become Lois McMaster Bujold. Even as it is, this _is_, despite all, a good, engrossing read. There is no denying it: I shook my head a lot, but I was greatly entertained. The moment when archvillain Ussher dies bravely, owing his heroic resistance much more to madness than to greatness, was really, really great.All in all, I'm a bit disappointed that Wren has not written any more SF."
3,adequate but nothing special,It works and is basic -- what was desired. Don't really need a fancy bathroom fixture. Thought the glass could have been lighter. What purpose does thick glass serve?
4,You had to be there,"Callas was at her peak during her years in Mexico City. My mother knew her. She was also an opera singer at the Palacio de Bellas Artes.I gave these recordings as a gift to my mother recently because she kept on saying during my youth that those operas were so great. After I gave them to her, she said Callas, was not a sweet delicate singer, she was inspriational in the way she acted on stage, and the tones she used to evoke emotion in an opera. Maria was the frist to do that.The recordings are not the greatest, the positive emotion it brought my mother gives it a 4 star rating.I myself prefer the Paris Debut, Tosca portion, where I can see Maria take control of the stage, and Tito raising to her challenge. That's Opera!"
5,Laughing in the Aisles,"I don't think this book was meant to be humorous, or maybe it was, but I nearly messed my pants when I looked at it. It was so funny I had to buy it. The pictures were hilarity at its best, and the accompanying script was even better. Truly a comedic genius that I highly recommend, whether you are a cat lover or not."
5,Whimsical,You know you want this. Very good pictures. Also very spiritual. One of the funniest things I've read in a while.
3,How were some of the pictures made?,"I share the concern of the reader from ""Cat Spring, Texas"" regarding how some of the pictures may have been made. Were some of the ""dancing"" cats in fact being bounced up and down on a trampoline? The people who enjoy books about animals are also concerned about the treatment of animals. I hope the next in this series of books is along the lines of ""Why Cats Meditate"" rather than, ""Why Cats Waterski."""
5,"Cat lovers, laugh and enjoy!","The photographs of these cats are absolutely stunning and at the same time familiar to anyone who has ever been allowed by a cat to share its home. While the photography is the main draw of this book, don't stop by just looking at the pictures. To truly enjoy the genius of the book, one has to read the comments and interviews with the cat-dancers. From spiritual connection to psycho-babble to childish perceptions, the narration is a delight and a hoot to read. The book is an absolutely perfect parody, leaving the reader just enough convinced to scratch her head and think, ""Is this for real?"""
1,"A waste of time, money, and intelligence.","This book is the most pathetic excuse for marketing and is an embarrassment to the cat lover's community. I gave this book to my brother-in-law to use as he is a great cat lover, and this book scarred their relationship to this day; his cat refuses to go near him for fear of him lifting up his hand/leg even a little bit. His cat is now paranoid of any people. The pictures are obviously digitally edited. I have seen better ... than this. Please do not think twice (or once) about buying this book. Please, do it for the cats."
2,Cats and performance art? No thanks....,"As the name implies, this book has pictures of people...uhm, dancing with cats. That's pretty much it. If you are a fan of performance art and/or a cat lover, this book will have some appeal to you. However, if neither of these things appeal to you (or if you are like me, where those topics not only do not appeal to you, but cause nausea upon sight), handle it like nuclear waste: use gloves, and tongs, and have it incinerated - otherwise, you will flip through it in about two seconds and wonder, ""What the **** did I just buy?"""
2,Pretentious,"This has to be one of the stupidest books I've ever read. When I first picked it up, I thought it was a cat/humor type book. Wrong. These people actually dance with cats. Talk about nutcases. The pictures of the cats were cute but the people dancing about in weird costumes was a bit out there. I adore cats just as much as the next cat lover but this book is a bit too much. Now, if I could get my cat to dance..."
2,I found it ok but boring!,"The book had lots of dialogue that to me was boring. It did take me two days to finish the book because I wanted to know how the story ended. I did find myself skipping quite a bit. In all fairness I'm not a western book fan, but some I've found amazing like Johanna lindsey's ""A heart so wild"" and ""All I need is you"".This story was ok, just the dialogue was boring and there was no chemistry between the characters! it was adventurist with a mysterious plot."
2,Ancient History/ Slow Slow read,"This was an extremely slow read. I was lost and I closed the book around the 3rd or 4th chapter. My suggestion, if the cover looks like an old English high school textbook, leave it alone. I never found the romance in this book."
4,Good as far as I can tell,"I'm in the market for an extensive drill bit set. I bought this small set to test the brand. I've used them 4-5 times now, and they seem to work just fine. I'll probably pull the trigger on a larger Steelex set base don my favorable experience with this entry-level set."
1,Disappointing,"After the first chapter, I had a bad feeling that I did not want to spend the season with Verona. The second chapter confirmed that feeling. I struggled through the book hoping for insight into Serie A, Italy, or even Verona. Tim Park was unable to deliver that insight. I can't put my finger on it, but there is something about his writing style that loses me as I read Tim Parks' books.If you are looking for a book on Serie A, Italian soccer, or Italy in general, this is not the book."
2,A Season with Verona,"I purchased this book after reading My Italian Neighbours which I really enjoyed. However I would only recommend this book to an avid Italian soccer fan. I am midway through and will struggle to finish it, a rare experience for me. I quite enjoyed the first couple of chapters setting the scene in relation to supporters and the experience of a couple of games."
1,be careful...,"It seemed like a good deal on a box of 24 so I ordered it. First bar out of the box was a mess. The wrapper was stuck to it. Then there was the issue of air pockets that were over an inch and a half long that should have had that bar rejected for being too light. Out of the 24 bars in the box,20 should have never made it out of the factory. I brought this to the attention of Amazon and they graciously made it right. I've since ordered from a different Amazon vendor and the product has been perfect. If these middleman candy companies want to sell rejects and seconds they need to say so upfront. Thanks Amazon for putting the customer first."
1,This BluRay is in Low Definition Picture Quality,"When you buy a BluRay, you expect HD Quality, and not VHS Quality.Unfortunately, the source material used in this BluRay was probably from VHS and so the quality suffers.The resolution looks worse than DVD quality (appears more blurry than 720x480) even though the technicalspecs on the packaging says 1080p (1920x1080). This makes sense as the source data is low resolution.You can re-master VHS a million times and the resolution won't get any higher. As far as content isconcerned, another reviewer correctly stated that this BluRay has less material than the 3-Disc AnniversaryEdition DVD. The only reason to buy this is if you can no longer find the DVD version."
2,Price Gouge!,"I searched around looking for a good Jordan BD to buy, and I came here. Considering the SD source material I am sure the $39.98 BD is most definitely NOT worth $144.98!! Maybe Amazon should look into it."
1,Low Definition Blu-ray,"The bluray is in low definition. All content is in VHS quality and not even bothered to remaster anything. The content is good, but is in a very poor quality, does not honor to MJ."
4,A must buy for M.J. Fan,"I was thinking to buy the Chicago Bull dynasty series, which is sold out everywhere. This is a good alternative; I didn't give it a five because of the video quality is not HD."
2,I paid only $3 for it,"listened to the whole thing, and probably won't listen to it again for a long time. The sound quality is the most important thing to me. On this CD, the band sound like they are playing under water. Since there are many Hawk CD's with good sound quality for under $10, why bother with this one? I like ""Hawk Eyes"" and ""Hawk in Paris""---especially the 2nd side. I also like Jonah Jones and Bob Scobey."
5,Beautiful and touching,"One of the reviews suggests that this music is somewhat specific to people of color. Although I am not a person of color, I love this music. It touches me deeply. This music is not about the 'Indigo' spirit is about the human spirit. Yes, one of the songs is about slavery - 'to be a slave' and what it means to the spirit but even so, I personally think that we all as people can (and should) imagine and feel what slavery may do to the human spirit. To be in chains, to be denied love, family, human dignity. The pain in the music is almost palpable. This is one of my favorite CDs"
3,Indigo lights your spirit!,"The new Indigo Spirit record is filled with roots and influences from southern music and develops into a well-mixed modern masterpiece. The strings will draw you closer to the different styles of music which include folk, techno and new wave. The album is well mixed but some songs seem to leave you hanging not amounting to much. The music is very relaxing and is great for developing a pleasant atmosphere. Indigo Spirit will touch you without knowing it. Don't let you first impression decide the outcome of the record."
3,Always Thought Subbed Was Better,"Cardcaptors HAD great potential. It still could have appealed to America's hearts (and money) with its uncut Japanese episodes. Still, the American distributor had to butcher Cardcaptor Sakura up and change it to the general Cardcaptors. While Sakura IS the only Cardcaptor (sorry folks, Li isn't really a Cardcaptor). The episodes are fairly entertaining and your kids will definitely enjoy it."
4,"It's OK,but it has some work to do","This vol. is messed up.The capture of the Watery card was one of the first episodes.Then when Meilin leaves Readington AMAZON left out the capture of the Twin card.Plus this episode is one of the last.Then comes Earth which is a Two episode show,plus the second episode of the Earth card brings to the beginning of the Final Jugdement.In the Watery episode Sakura must choose 2 out of 3 cards that she first captures to capture Watery.Quiet a good plan.Next was the Twin card where Meilin leaves.She thinks she wasn't wanted since Li always made it hard for her and never said how prode he was of her.Final the Earth card. In this episode(s) everthing starts to revele it self.All of the episodes are good but they need to be in order and AMAZON should tell you about the Twin card and if the beginning of the Final Jugdement is there as well."
1,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS!,"Ahem. As stated above, don't but it. Even though it hasn't come out yet, it is provived that this tape is crap. How do I know? Simple, all off Cardcaptors is crap, and second we've seen it on TV. (OoOoOh, look at the shiny red button on my VCR labeled REC!) Please just go buy the original, Cardcaptor Sakura. Thank you. *bows and runs off*"
5,An Outstanding Manual,"I've always found Quark to be rather ""clunky"" and hard to use as opposed to Pagemaker, but this manual does an excellent job of simplifying the program for novice users. It's obvious the author has done his homework on what makes a good training manual. There are plenty of bad ones out there, but this book is one of the best I've ever used."
4,Great score...wish it were longer!,"I really liked the score just from hearing a clip of it played at the opening menu on the 'Nicholas Nickleby' DVD. Very pleasant, easy listening. It immediately caught my ear and I knew I had to buy the CD.I am a tad disappointed in the soundtrack though. I don't mind that the main theme repeats itself most of the tracks. My main problem is that the tracks are too short! There are 22 tracks in all, but at about 40 min. worth of total music, quite a few of the tracks hover at the minute mark, which seems rather silly. Only the first and last tracks are of substantial length. Although they seem to follow their appearance in the movie fairly accurately, I would not have minded if perhaps a 'suite' had appeared.I know it's unlikely, but I would dearly love an expanded release. Overall however, it's a good score."
5,Magic--wish it were longer!,"I was greatly moved by this film; Nickleby's story is an inspiration for our times, and I thought it was well produced on screen. But I forgot about how much I liked the music until an Amazon review popped up accidentally in some web search or other. I rushed out to buy the CD, and thanks to the reviewers here, I was prepared for the fact that it's awfully short. Even so, the music is so charming and the main theme so sweetly uplifting, it's all forgivable. Thanks to Ms. Portman for a wonderful score, and yes, I'd love it if she would compose an entire suite."
3,Mellowing with age?,"Proving that Saint Etienne are becoming prolific again after a lengthy hiatus in the mid 90's, this album also suggests that the band is running short of original ideas. The songs here are surprisingly mellow and the percussion and melodies are mostly sparse and uninspired. They almost sound bored on this album. One could think that Sarah and the boys are nestling into an easy listening/adult contemporary vein akin to the Carpenters (whom Sarah Cracknell name drops on this album, BTW). Still, this isn't an entirely unsuccessful album: ""Heart Failed"", ""Don't Back Down"" and ""Boy is Crying"" are memorable and catchy. It's just that, after repeated listenings, this one falls short on inspiration and creativity, unlike their first two albums --""Foxbase Alpha"" and ""So Tough"" -- which were creative dynamos."
2,An OBSCURE-DISK Commentary,"One hardly expects anything but ultra-selfconscious pastiche from these urbane Londoners, but even Julian Cope might have scratched his head at Saint Etienne's recent collaboration with Teutonic electro-minimalists To Rococo Rot and Stereollama Sean O'Hagan. Sound Of Water is, sonically at least, a note-perfect composite of the participants: verdant rushes of harpsichord and strings laid over beds of lightly percolating electronics. Sadly, SE neglected to write compelling songs to match the sonic setting, and most of the album drifts by elegantly on a cloud of sub-Bacharach meandering. The perma-underwhelming Sound of Water will bore newcomers and leave fans wondering about the wisdom of putting Krautrock in their Northern soul."
5,"Pop sweetness, and love by Saint Etienne.","All I can say is Sarah Cracknell of St.Etienne could be singing about the ingredients to a Macaroni salad, and still make that song sound like the sexiest, most beautiful song out there. She is so talented. Her voice is so melodic and sweet. The songs in this album are I think the mellowest I've heard from St.Etienne, but that doesn't mean they aren't being innovative. I love ""Heart Failed"", and ""How We Used To Live"", and basically the whole album. I gave it a 4 though, because I do miss the dance fun they exherted on ""He's On The Phone"" or ""Tell Me Why""(their collaboration with Paul Van Dyke). They are all great people, and indeed they are getting better as time goes by. You won't find pop more pure than Saint Etienne."
3,Skip this one,"First, let me be clear - I think the original Sound of Water release is an excellent, five-star cd; pleasant, relaxing and simply beautiful. The problem with this import (and why I only give it three stars) is that the extra tracks included here are all found on Saint Etienne's Interlude cd, along with a bunch of other great b-sides and and an enhanced video of ""How We Used To Live."" So get Interlude, the original Sound of Water, and don't waste your bucks on this one."
1,dont like it,I extremely disliked this book. It's very confusing and is not good for someone younger than 15 because it is so confusing. It seems like it has no point and the ending is stupid.
1,Ending freaked out my 11 year old.,"If you have a child that is sensitive to unhappy endings, this is NOT the book to give him or her. My 11 year old daughter was very upset with the ending of the book. She couldn't bear the thought of the girls regressing in age even more. I expect her to have nightmares tonight."
1,TERRIBLE,"This book is terrible. The style of writing, the plot, and the worst part of this book was the ending! If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time."
3,Disappointing lack of closure,"Fascinating premise but the reason I kept reading was to find out how they resolved this seemingly unresolvable problem, and what exactly would happen at the end. I don't like it when the writer violates the writer-reader implied contract which says, ""Be patient and all the loose ends will be tied up and it will all make sense at the end."" Haddix blinked. I call foul."
2,Boring,"It was an okay book, good story line but a little boring and hard to follow. If you like science fiction it would be a good book for you."
3,What was the plot?,"This book was ok, but there wasn't much of a plot. I started it but then read a few books in between, which is not the best sign since I usually can't put a book down once I start it."
3,Turnabout,"This book had an incredibly intriguing plot line, that was actually scientifically backed (yay for author research!) and had legitimate explanations, unlike most sci-fi books, which are generally, ""Well, this happened because I'm the author and I said so."" There was a great contrast between Melly and Anny Beth, which made you want to learn about both of them. However, the constant skipping back and forth between the year 2000 and the year 2085 became so distracting that it felt like reading two entirely separate books rather than the same book. I understand why it was necessary to understand everything, but that doesn't mean it was enjoyable.Read the specifics?http://thaliasbooks.tumblr.com/post/14584820800/turnabout-review~Thalia Anderson"
2,Really complicated and confusing plot!,"This book is about two girls, Melly and Anny Beth, who take a shot called PT-1 to make them deage. This book just follows them around and explains what it would be like to ""live twice"". I gave this book two stars because of how confusing and complicated it was to read. The Chapters are set up to rotate from 2001 to 2085 every other chapter. I also didn't like the end of the book, because there wasn't one. The story just stops and your looking for another page. I did enjoy so of this book, like sometimes they would leave you hanging and you can't put it down. This book would be good for people who like strange fanticy books. I really didn't care for this book but others really did."
3,Intriguing,"I was so excited to read this book based on what an awesome subject it has... The two main characters Amelia and Anny Beth are already 100 and 103 in the year 2001 when some doctors come to them and ask if they would like to be younger. Well, of course the answer is yes. This leads them to a scientific experiment that actually reverses the aging process.Trouble is the reversing never stops. So when we join the 2 again in 2085, they have undergone the difficult task of finding a ""parent"" to take care of them when they become too young to do so themselves.My main problem with the book, however, is that it does not really come to a concussion, it just ends. And I think there were also some continuity errors about what Amelia and Anny Beth could remember and when.Overall, it is still well worth the read and a high rating just on the concept alone."
5,A great read for adolescents!,"My 11-year old neice loves this author, so I bought several books for her for Christmas. She read the first book on Christmas Day and immediately started another."
3,Turnabout,"This book was science fiction, but perhaps not for long. The idea of reversing age does seem impossible now, but maybe in the future they could invent something like this. At some points, Turnabout was hard to understand. I did not understand why Melly and Anny Beth were running away from the agency, and the ending didn't really conclude the book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in futuristic ideas."
4,Growing Down,"This is an excellent book. I have read three other of Margaret Peterson Haddix's books including ""Just Ella"",""Among the Hidden"",and ""Running Out of Time"",this is her best book so far. Melly and Anny Beth were part of the experiment Turnabout that took place in the year 2000. It is now the year 2085 and they are in their teens. Ms. Haddix's views of the future sound accurate. I am curious to see if they come true 80 years from now."
5,TURNABOUT,I think everyone should get to read Turnabout because its a really good book with lots of action and excitement. Even though it's fiction and it's of a different time. It's a good education and full of excitement. It's one of the best books she has written.
4,Turnabout,Turn about is a book written by Margaret Peterson Haddix. It is an exciting book that has many twists and turns. The younger readers might not be as interested in it as the older readers but it is still a good book. It is about two girls named Anne Beth and Melly. When they are old and ready to die they take a shot that is supposed to make them younger. When they get too young they are supposed to take another shot that is supposed to make them get older. This is my third book by Margaret and I am looking forward to reading some more.
5,A Freaky Story,"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading science fiction. Though may be confusing for younger kids. It was interesting and freaky to see what was happening in Amelia and Anny Beth's futuristic world. I also thought it was exciting to find out how the book ended. I wondered what decisions Melly and Anny Beth would have to make next, and how they would find purpose in their second life. It was a clever interesting and well written book."
3,Try it out...,"This was an intresting book, if not a well written and exciting one. The story of these 2 women going through their lives again backwards in a new century was amusing, but not very exciting since most of the memories they had of past lifetimes were vanishing and it was all kinda depressing....i was also very disappointed with the ending. I do suggest reading it however becuz it is somewhat thought-prevoking."
1,mail and key cabinet,I was going to send it back - it is huge and ugly. It cost so much to ship and ship back it wasn't worth it to send back but I didn't like it for my house. I should have measured first before purchasing.
1,Not much content,"I am not slamming the book. There are a lot of great thoughts in the book on how to be a better version of yourself. I just feel that the book lacked a ""guide"" of how to become that better you."
5,"Fantastic, Life Changing, Excellent!","Jinger's book turned my life around!! When I read the first chapter I was so impressed I went to the book store where I had bought it and bought every copy they had to give to my friends!! It's a ""must read""!"
4,"Great instrument, but is it safe?","I love the classic metal design, but the red paint on the underside of it is chipping off...whether your child bites the mouthpiece or simply uses normal play, the paint eventually chips off. So, I'm hoping to contact the company to make sure the paint is lead free!"
2,Maybe mine's defective...,"Picked this up at a music store just for fun. This isn't a huge problem, but it only works for me when I use it backwards. I've only used cheap plastic kazoos before, and I've never had this problem.If you haven't checked the replies to the other reviews, someone said that the paint does not contain lead, so that's good. Mine is definitely starting to chip a little."
1,Paint chips within minutes,"The paint on this began to chip within minutes of my toddler daughter playing it, and the toy was made in China. Now I'm worried that it might have been lead-based paint."
3,"Nice device, I guess","Item was ordered because I thought it would be a nice alternative to using a mouse. Unfortunately, while the product was made well and might work well for some, its certainly not a replacement for your standard mouse or touchpad. Very few applications seem to be able to use this, and I had difficulty configuring the one application I tried: google earth. Its a solid device but in need of some applications and a willingness on the user's part to learn how to work it."
4,Great Product,"This is a great device for anyone that does 3D modeling or 3D Cad work. Use in your left hand in concert with your mouse in the right hand makes for a really fast working space. It really speeds things up. The only reason I did not give this the full 5 stars is because this product does not come with any support. Not even email. You can only post a question on their forum and hope someone answers the question. I have been having trouble with the two keys not maitaining their settings. If you buy the SE of this item, it comes with support. The only difference between the Personal Edition (PE) and the Standard Edition (SE) is price and support. The SE version is about $98 and included support while the PE is about $50 and does not include support. The hardware is identical. As such the PE edition is not licensed for commercial use."
1,Mac Artists Beware: Absolutely Worthless,"What an absolute WASTE! This device hardly works with ANYTHINNG on the Macintosh! I'm very irritated with having to have gone through the hassle of ordering and returning this complete piece of junk! I was duped into it after seeing it on Apple's website, touting support for it in the latest version of Motion (v. 4). It didn't do anything in Motion and neither does it do anything in any other application. The Mac drivers are complete garbage. Don't waste your time."
2,Pretty useless,"While this might be a cool toy for navigating Google Earth, etc. I find this device useless for the regular user. All because none of the movements are programmable. With exception of two little buttons you can NOT assign left, right, forward, backward, etc to do what one might want to do, such as browsing internet via browser for example, or navigate through your images in Light Room application. Sadly I had to return this device due to its uselessness in real world applications."
1,not right for me,I bought this to use as a navigation control for my ham radio (Flex 3000). I didn't like it at all - it was way to sensitive and I couldn't adjust it to do what I hoped it would do. I communicated a bit with the software designers who implemented this device for the radio software but just couldn't get things to work smoothly.I'm sure it's probably great for graphics use or whatnot - just not good for me and my PowerSDR software - YMMV.
2,Pet Rock,"Limited application-- I used to to fiddle around with Google Earth (for which it is an interesting HID). I'd have thought that LogiTech would have added some more mundane functionality to it, e.g., as a volume control, scrolling device (like the Griffin PowerMate). If you're using it for autocad and other specifically supported applications, it will probably be more useful for you. Perhaps future software versions will extend its feature set. For now though, it supports what it supports-- and that's what it supports."
3,Too Light,"I own the space pilot and it is wonderful, this is just too light and lifts off the ground when I use it."
4,"Great! With a price this low, why wait?","I love this product, using it for Google Earth, Autocad and Sketchup so far. It really transforms Google Earth - it becomes much more of an idle exploring tool with this added control & sensation of flying. Flew across the Irish Sea and investigated a dam I found in Scotland somewhere - fascinating stuff!Sketchup: again - transformation. Autocad - great in 3D mainly otherwise negligible.Nice build quality - heavy base - therefore not really a portable item though in size it could be.Down side: sometimes glitchy about switching between open programs. Also please note: install anything you are going to use this with BEFORE the drivers - only programs that are installed get driver support from the 3D navigator.Well worth fiddling with though at this price."
4,A must have for 3d work,"I first saw these while taking classes for Inventor. At first I thought they we more a novelty.I bought the least expensive model for home use. Now, while at work, I find myself reaching for the navigator.Am definately going to have to get one for work now.Get one and you'll be amazed how much easier working in the 3d enviroment is."
5,"A ""Must Have"" Addition to Your Sketchup Workstation","I bought this gizmo specifically for use with Sketchup. I am happy to report that the SpaceNavigator's ""six degrees of freedom"" functionality truly augments and extends SU's navigation commands. My favorite feature is *roll*, which enables you to make your SU model pirouette like a ballerina. Try doing that with SU's *orbit* command! However, be forewarned: if you use SU 6 you'll have to download the latest driver. Also, SU elements such as trees that have a high polygon count do tend to create significant lag in the SpaceNav's screen rendering. But, hey - when I turn my trees off, SpaceNav simply flies! Last, but not least, this input device is well crafted, handles well, and will look great on your desk. :)"
4,Small and Heavy and Accurate,"The unit is small, which is good because I'm a student and need to take it to school and back every day.The base is heavy, which is good because it doesn't go sliding around while I'm trying to use it.The accuracy is very good, which helps when I'm trying to find the right angle to continue modeling.Also, it looks really cool.The cons:No support for programs outside of what is listed in the official compatability chart.The sensitivity takes some getting used to and tweaking to get it right.Notes:The control only moves less than a centimeter in any direction. The motion is NOT continuous.I went cheap ant got the little one with only 2 buttons that are hard to press without accidently moving the handle. Any serious modeller will most likely want the ones with 20+ buttons so that you don't have to switch hands to the keyboard as often.Software used to test: Solidworks 2008, Pro/E Wildfire 4.0."
5,Go Buy Four Copies,"First off, I hate giving 5 star reviews. Seems like 99% of the Amazon reviewers give five stars (likely because they bought a book, and as a human being, they need to justify the purchase by giving a glowing review).That being said, I'm giving Vintage Jesus 5 big ones.It's very difficult to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ in 2008. Yet, as a Christian, I am charged with sharing this gospel.""Vintage Jesus"" provides me with the tools to help do so.Author Mark Driscoll provides frank answers to very difficult questions about the deity of Jesus, his humanness, his abilities.Vintage Jesus is not a dry Sunday sermon - but rather a droll biblical account of who Jesus was and is.His book provides a thoughtful, forceful and thoroughly referenced telling of Jesus.It's written so well, I'm buying four copies and giving them as gifts next week for Easter."
4,A simple straightforward history of the Hebrews,"The Story of Israel is one of the textbooks for the Old Testament Survey course I teach at the community college. Because background information is essential to understanding the environment into which these people came (though VERY unpopular to students!), Dr. Tullock writes a brief but informative section on background. It is long enough to set the stage, but short enough to keep the students interested in the course. In an effort to keep the book short, Dr. Tullock does not cover everything, but does a great job overviewing and explaining the important spots. I am pleased with this book and plan to continue using it for the courses I teach."
1,what a waste of money,I know some of us have to buy this for a class but this was ridiculous. The book restates scripture literally old testament section verse by verse (you can read the OT yourself) and then with extremly poor arguments tries to bring all of scripture into question. I never post reviews but this is just that bad.I guess if you are an extreme liberal that did not believe that scripture was true it would be ok. As for me what a waste of my time and money.
4,History of Suburbanization in America,"It's an acknowledged classic in the field of Urban History, but it's twenty years old and the last quarter of Crabgrass reads like it. Delores Hayden has covered the same ground in her more recent ""Building Suburbia"". The approach is hisorical, Jackson takes each period of suburbanization in chronological order. In terms of explanation for why America is so surburban, he focuses on government policy and the unique characteristics of the american middle class mind. Also, the fact that land is cheap is important. Readers may want to check out Building Suburbia for a more recent treatment of the same subject."
5,Crabgrass and suburbs,I used this work for my background research on the post-WWII suburban housing market. Jackson's work is cited many times by a diverse group of scholars in geography and sociology. I find it a good reading book and very helpful to understand the housing market that so recently broke down.
2,Not what I expected,"Although this book is fiction, the details of the way of life that Nahid describes in her book is incorrect."
5,"Was required, but very much enjoyed it","I am a Sophomore college student, and this book was actually assigned for my ethics class. I didn't really have a strong urge to read it, but seeing as it was assigned, I read anyway. I started reading it yesterday, and finished it today. As other reviewers here have said, I didn't want to put it down. The writing style had enough ""hooks"" to keep me wanting to see what would happen next or what I would discover about Feri and her relationships. It is a very easy and quick read, and gives me a much better understanding of a culture that I'm sure few Americans know about."
1,LEAD,"MY son was so happy to recive his scobby doo lunch box and so was I, but when we got the item it did not say lead free so I did a test and it tested positve for lead. I e-mailed the company that sold it and asked why they are selling lead based lunch bags and with all the recalls on lead based toys and lunch bags and the whole brain damage thing to young children why would they still sell them and there response was if I could prove to them that it was on a recall list then they would do a refund. I for sure thought that they would have some concern but I geuss not so buyer be ware when using this company and test for lead.IScooby Doo Lunch Bag / Messenger bagof lead."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this for my 6-year-old grandson's birthday. The zipper broke the first time he used it that day! Unfortunately, there was no packing slip from the seller, so I'm having difficulty even contacting someone about a refund (I don't see any point in replacing it with the same poorly-designed product). Don't waste your money!"
2,Not bad...,"This CD isn't all that bad, but I wouldn't get another of theirs. They have sold out shows and have become quite popular. Their CD was recommended to me by someone who works at concerts and has been to several of their shows and is well-rounded in both Scottish and Irish bands. This is a good band if you like Irish rock, but the band I recommend for Irish music is DEFFINATLY Flogging Molly. They have more Irish based music and have an assortment of songs that any Irish fan is sure to find favor in. For now, it's still Flogging Molly all the way!"
5,rude not to!,"A truly wonderous album,best yet,surely must be time for another.Plse give me another reason to fly across the pond!"
3,Whats not to like,"Squeeze has been around for years and the enduring quality of their music speaks for itself, Annie;Tempted; and the tuneful Nail in the heart are my favorites. The rest are good too but I don't have time to get into detail now. Buy it you won't be disappointed.J.F.M."
1,Poor audio - wish I would've listened to previous reviewer,"A previous review stated that the audio quality was poor - wish I would have taken him/her at his/her word! The songs are great but there is no depth to them at all. Very AM radio sounding. When I play them in a mix with other songs, I have to turn up the volume because they are so thin. Disappointed."
2,Misleading Title!,"While I do believe that this book has merit, it is as a JEWELRY MAKING BOOK, not as a bead making book. I feel that the Title of the book is misleading.....to me, a ""Bead Artist"" is a person who MAKES beads, not a person who makes jewelry with beads. That is a ""JEWELRY ARTIST"". A small point, but significant, since this book is listed under ""Lampwork"". Nice photographs, and as I said, the book has merit if you are looking for some VERY SIMPLE stringing ideas."
5,The Art & Soul of Glass Beads,"If you have ever admired art glass beads and wanted to learn to string them, The Art and Soul of Glass Beads will certainly get you started. Sixteen amazing lampwork artists talk about their own creativity, what got them started and share a few tips and advise on where to go to find proper equipment, glass and get help along the way. Many of these artists pour out their ""souls"" and share their beads as well as their experiences as they struggled to learn methods to this ancient craft as well as how to buy their beads for use in your own work. The book also has lots of projects for art bead jewelry makers. The book has easy to follow jewelry directions, illustrations, glossaries and how-tos. The photography is very high quality. I would say that anyone interested in art glass beads as a craft would find the book helpful. I enjoyed each artist's own narrative. It was a very personal look at glass bead jewelry: art and soul."
2,Very Misleading Title,"I should have read the other reviews first. If you are looking for a book to outline and explain the technique of glass bead making, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK!!!! Only buy this if you want some pictures of beads or are interested in making jewerely."
5,Meeting new Artists,"As a bead collector, not maker, I enjoyed the book tremendously. I saw techniques I'm not familiar with as well as an introduction to new artists. I liked the directions for stringing and simple diagrams. I plan to incorporate some beads into my own art work (I'm a potter) and the variety of work gave me fresh ideas to use in my own medium."
2,Not a very good book........,"I was glad I only paid a few dollars for this book because it's not very good. It has picutes of beads and a bioraphy of the artists that made them but has no instructions or ""techniques"" on how they were made. It had instructions on how to string jewelry with the beads but nothing on how to make them. Very dissapointing."
3,"A book about stringing, NOT about making beads","Some of the other reviews and the editorial info fail to make it clear that this book shows you exactly how to string some (not very inspiring) necklaces with lampwork beads, but it is NOT a book about making lampwork beads. There are exhaustive (and to me anyway, pretty tedious) biographies of a lot of artists, but there is so little about their actual techniques that I was only frustrated. It's not very informative to say, you can make anything out of Moretti glass! Well, sure, but how? So, if you would like to know the stories of some bead artists, and if you want to know exactly how to construct a few necklaces, you will like this book. For me... well, I would have given it 1 star, except that it's hard to blame the book for being not what I expected. I would have preferred to see the artists discuss their techniques in a lot more detail."
3,devonshire melba toast,The melba toast was tasty and fresh. One complaint is that about 20% of the individual cellophane packages had cracked slices!! I realize that store-bought melbas have a worse then 20% breakage.
5,Great Swing with originals and classics,"You don't have to be in a swing dance club to enjoy the music on this CD. These tracks include blues, jazz, latin/salsa, dixieland but stay in the swing groove.There's jitterbugging with ""She's the Most"". Tom Whalens slick guitar in the bluesy ""I'm Here To Tell You"" and ""Mean Old Frisco"". If you want a slow ballad with slow dancin then its ""All of These Things"". Fine, fine vocals by Megan Keith.""He Ain't Got Rhythm"" shows some sax & trombone with dixieland undertones. Do you want to hear some latin & percussion with a Santana like guitar? Then its ""I'm Obsessed"".And, how do you critique "" Mean Streets""..... there's some doo-wop, some blues, cool jazz and great harmonic vocals. The instruments are Bass, guitar and a touch of flute. The flutist is Collin Tilton. The sax and flute musician on Van Morrison's""Moondance"" album..... enough said?Swing demands the right rhythm's, the right vocals/harmony and fine musicians. ""Hey Sailor"" does it all!!!!"
1,Didn't stay nice for long,"Bought this less than 2 years ago; despite not having used it much, it's in bad condition. Not sure if it's discoloration or disappearance of first layer, but anyway the whole pan is mottled brown. I didn't treat it harshly, just normal cooking. I use my mom's Wolfgang Puck Cafe Collection stainless steel pan as well. In comparison, that one is much heavier and surface looks perfectly fine. So that makes me think this particular pan was not made well and it's not somehow my fault. Disappointing."
5,a terrific pan,I have been using this pan since I purchased it-both inside the oven and on top of the stove.I am extremely satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone.
1,cususinart pan,The Pan was a second it turned black as soon as I fried some poek chops. unforunatly I did not save the package for the prouduct. or register it so I am stuck with a pan I can not use. I also sent a message to cusinart to see if there had been a problem with this pan and did not recieve a answer back. very poor business from this company and I wll never buy another product from them. I have had a set of farberware for thirty years and the pans never changed. I needed this particular pan for a baking pan .
1,A ridiculous design pan!!!,"The base is non-sticky, but the inside edge is not! Keep the food away from the edge while cooking is ridiculous."
3,please remove photo of bottom of pan,this photo shows gauge 18-10 stainless on bottom of pan it is not that gauge of steel photo needs to be updated
1,Terrible Cookware!,I have tried everything to cook successfully with this pan. I gave it one star only because the size and shape of the pan is great and I love that it has a lid. But that is the only nice thing that I can say about it. Everything burns and sticks! I have coated the pan with oil and turned the heat down low as they suggest. The only way that things do not burn is if you have it on so low that nothing will cook thoroughly on the pan. Terrible! I bought this pan because of the Cuisinart reputation...guess they should stick to food processors.
2,not 18/10 stainless steel pan,"I am really disappointed because I ordered this pan expecting it to be as described, but unfortunately it did not. I called the customer service and they offered my to give me back 20% or to give full refund, and because I am leaving within one month, I thought I won't have enough time to look for another one, besides, they told me if they are going to mail me another pan it will be the same so no benifit from returning it, anyway, I haven't used it, it look nice and the only reason to give it 2 star only is just becuse I felt so bad as they fooled me with this purchase."
3,Surprisingly thin side walls and lid.,"Giving it a three for thinness.The base of the pan (a separate plate bonded to the bottom of the thin steel pan) is nice and thick, but the side walls and lid are _really_ thin. I guess I shouldn't have expected much for $20, but the picture makes it look a bit better than it really is.I haven't tried cooking with it, but my initial impression is that this is not a good pan for a gas range.I will probably return it unused, and try to find something with thicker side walls."
4,Worth the money,For the cost this is a great pan! Lots of cooking area and it fits into the oven nicely. I like the fact that you can cook at a lower temperature and also that it cleans up easily. C
5,Great Everyday Pan!,We purchased this pan to use on the stovetop and also in the oven. We were looking at pans $200-$300 for this purpose and just happened to find this Cuisinart. We tried it and LIKED IT!!! I highly recommend this pan to others.
3,still a sticky pan for me,"i bought the 14 piece set and added this pan. i still can't fry or saute in these without sticking. i find nonstick pans much better for this purpose still. maybe it's to cook, since everyone else gives these pans a five. i would give the pots a five, just not the frying type pans."
4,Nice and big.,"Our family is growing by leaps and bounds so I need bigger cookware. This pan fit the bill. It's perfect to cook 4 or 5 pork chops in, or fry chicken or make other food without crowding the pan so every thing browns beautifully! I love it! The lid is taller than it looks in the picture, which I think is a little goofy looking, but it works well, and if you have something really big in there like a whole chicken or a roast i guess it's a good thing. Over all, the bottom is very thick and great for heat distribution, the sides are thin to keep the price down and the pan light. I am very happy with the quality and design of this pan. The only reason I took a star away is that this is made in China. I did not see that in the description when I ordered it."
5,Had to replace 1st one but the 2nd was great,"This product sells at Sears for $80 so when I saw this on Amazon for $28, I bought it right away! I own theCuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 14-Inch Stir-Fry Pan with Helper Handle and Glass Coverand I've never had problems with it. I love that oil heats up very quickly and evenly in this pan. However, black spots appeared on the surface of the pan after the first use. I've read about these spots from previous reviews so I was concerned. I did the online return process and Amazon sent a replacement in just 2 days! I've been using this pan at least 3x in a week and so far no problems. The first one, I figured, was a fluke. I'm very happy with this pan and I highly recommend it!UPDATE (12/2011): I love this pan so much that I put the entire set on my wedding registry. I got theCuisinart Contour Stainless 13-Piece Cookware Setlast month and I've been using it everyday since I got it. I love it!"
1,BEWARE-Lining peels on heating pot first time!!!!!,This was a lesson in what not to buy in cookware from Amazon. First time I put water in the pot added salt and put on low heat to boil after five minutes noticed a strage black spot developing in the pot and then several more appeared. The stainless steel peeled away to reveal a lower black layer. Seems I got a fake! It was like watching a gold overlay item peeling. So disappointing because I had already ordered a second cuisinart pot but still have not used it for fear of ingesting strange toxins from this peeling. Single star for prompt amazon delivery. The product however is a sham....
5,Must-have for avid cooks,"Extremely well-made pan. It's useful with a very large surface, great for reductions & dishes with rice. If you are among the few who still cook at home for a family, you will be glad to have this in your collection for dishes that might otherwise need a wok. This is, however, far more versatile than a wok and far smaller, which makes it easier to find storage space if you're not working in a restaurant-sized kitchen."
4,"Great lightweight Pan but not ""stay cool"" handles","This is a great lightweight pan but is not inferior in working. I have the other Cuisinart heavy 12"" pan with long handle and though it was superior in quality, it was heavy to work with. In my apartment with electric range this pan was so comfortable to work with that the other heavy pan was used only for emergency.However, when we moved to our home with gas range, the small handles became the problem. Being so close to the flame, the handles heat up a lot and becomes impossible to hold (so much for their ""stay cool handle"" claim). An oven mitt so close to the fire was dangerous as it once caught fire. So I am back to the heavy long handle pan, and those long handles are really ""stay cool"". Hence I had to reduce one star. Otherwise they are great and I still use it for short frying where I do not need to hold the handles."
4,"Shiny, new kitchen bling","Love this pan. Ordered it Wednesday, was on my porch Thursday. Was very surprised when I took it out of the box. Don't know what others reviewers were looking at because this is a very solid pan. Just heavy enough without being too heavy, you know? If you were to hit someone with it (not saying you should...)it would do some damage to that person and not to the pan. Can't wait to try it out this weekend. Going to break it in in-style with Ossobuco."
4,Great Pan!!!,Great Pan Stainless Steel Pan. It is big enough for all cooking needs and very easy to clean. It is also oven safe !!!
5,Greatest pan! Easy purchase.,"This pan is the greatest. Very easy to clean. IF sticks just let it soak for a few minutes. No need to scrub. I especially like that the metal handles allow you to put this in the oven. In my book, this pan is very versatile. This was an easy purchase thru amazon and it shipped quickly."
5,Luv it!,"great item! Domed lid really works makes it very convenient when cooking over sized items. Easy clean-up too. Not too big, not too small"
1,"Terrible product, very thin and flimsy","The stainless steel material is very thin, and it feels very cheap. The stainless steel coating/exterior was GONE after one use, completely blackened. I was just trying to brown some ribs and the heat was medium high. NOT worth it. Youa are much better off with Calphalon everyday pan."
4,In love.,"My cooking has improved dramatically since buying this pan. Great for everyday use and very high quality. It does take maintenance to keep it looking nice, but that's ok, just buy yourselfBar Keepers Friend Cleanser & Polish: 12 OZbefore purchasing any stainless steel pans. Wish the lid was clear glass, and I know there are heavier duty pans out there, but I don't regret this purchase one bit...and I bet this pan will last the rest of my life."
3,Cusinart Chef's Classic Stainless Pan,We did not realize that the pan could only be used at low to medium heat levels. This limits it usefulness to us. We have only used it one time since we purchased it earlier this year. I probably would not have bought it if I had known it had this limitation.
5,I love this pan,"Cleans up easy, is beautiful & elegant. Love the lid too! Goes from stove top to oven w/ease!"
4,excellent variation on the everyday pan theme,"Have been a happy user of this product line for several years, using this as my primary cooking platform most nights of the week. Purchased this to go along with the addition of a dishwasher to our happy home. Advertised as dishwasher safe, which appears to be true, but you will be happier washing it by hand. Yes, it comes out clean, but it just appears more appealing after air drying in the rack. Either way, a great item for cooking the vast majority of foodstuffs. Buy, enjoy."
3,good...but not as I thought,yeah this product is better than other SS products. but not so good for flat top. size is much bigger..so does not heat evenly.Now I think If I could buy smaller one than that would be better for me.
5,Excellent Value,"Purchased this pan to replace a same-sized non-stick pan because of health considerations and all the favorable reviews here. This pan is solidly and beautifully made. It does make a very nice presentation statement and should last forever. It cooks evenly and has a special lip which makes pouring easy and facilitates the sealing of the lid, which makes chicken and fish turn out wonderfully moist and delicious. However, no matter what method of oiling, preheating, closing the lid, etc., my food still always sticks to some extent - probably this is the downside for healthy stainless steel - but the pan is easy to clean after some hot-water and dish-washing-liquid soaking. Note: the lid is solid stainless steel so not 'see through', but a clear 12"" universal frying pan lid fits just fine... This pan is way worth it: it's beautiful, cooks well, is healthy, and easy enough to clean. The price is unbelievable. Five Stars, Excellent Value!!"
4,Good value.,"A little light weight, but does the job well. Searing on the cook top and then finishing in the oven.Make sure you have oil on the sides of the pan as well, this area can be hard to clean after it has been used in the oven."
5,Value and Quality,"I bought this at the same time I bought the Cuisinart 12"" pan with the long handle - because you couldn't get a lid for it, and I thought the price of this pan with the lid was about what you would pay for a lid alone. Well, the lid fits both pans, and the funny thing is, I'm not so good at using the handle to flip stuff in the pan, and I wind up using this everyday pan (which is identical except for the handle) because it fits in the sink and is easier to wash. The long handled version won't lie down flat in the sink since the handle is so long, and I like to let the pan soak a while so it is easier to clean. The quality of these pans are great, and I love the results. I've been using non-stick pans for years, and I've become concerned about the contaminants in them and switched to these - I wish I had years ago. They really do work better."
1,What Happened to Cuisinart Cookware???,"Recently, I ordered this pan and couldn't wait for it to arrive. BOY, was I disappointed when it did. It is not at all the quality of my other, older Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless cookware. It's not even close! The pan is very thin, lightweight and ""tinny"" sounding. It was so thin, the edges felt sharp to the touch. It seemed it would bend easily and not last long. This pan didn't even look like stainless steel. Guess I should have known, by the low price, something was wrong. I would much rather pay a little more to have a quality, heavyweight, long-lasting pan. What has happened to Cuisinart cookware? Thankfully, Amazon refunded my money promptly! I hope this helps someone avoid disappointment."
2,Not easy to clean,"A few of the reviews have commented that this is very easy to clean but it has not been my experience. The pan is quite shallow so I get oil splatters all over the stove. After a few uses, there is a brownish tarnish on the inside of the pan that I cannot get out."
3,"Pretty, but not 18/10 as described","UPDATEDA very nice, pretty stainless steel everyday pan and (when received a) welcome addition to kitchen. However Amazon needs to change the description because this is not an 18/10 pan. This inaccuracy detracts from the product and should be corrected.Clearly does not compare to other Cuisinart pans owned for years. Food heats unevenly and often burns, sticking to bottom even on simmer. Does not clean easily."
5,Just the best! don't know how I managed without it!,"This is amazingly versatile, Great for almost everything. I've cooked sautes, au gratins, small roasts, ragouts, vegetables and deserts in this pan. Nice sturdy handles make it easy to lift and carry. The pan heats quickly and evenly, I do use hot pads but the hands stay relatively cool for quite a while. the useful domed lid equals a self basting feature and give the pan more room for roast than I expected. It also makes a great serving piece really beautiful and elegant on the table. Its sturdy enough to use outdoors or take to potlucks etc. Definitely an all purpose pan for the stove top, in the oven, in the fridge or freezer and on the table."
5,Great Everyday Pan,"I ordered this pan along with a few other Cuisinart cookware during one of the 4-for-3 Amazon promotions offered. This is an awesome pan for essentially what it is labeled as...an ""everyday"" pan. The ""one-pot"" cookers will really enjoy this pan.Buyers be aware that this is the Chef's Classic series and not MultiClad. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, the pan is very lightweight and the feel is different from the MultiClad line.Nevertheless, the pan performs very well. While it is very large (12 inches), it is great when you may sauté two (or more) different portions of your meal in the same pot. It would be nice to see this in a 10 inch size too!!It would be nice if this pan included a stainless steel and glass cover."
5,Really nice pan,"This is a nice pan, good weight, nice finish, easy to handle. The lid is heavy enough to keep the steam inside.When this arrived at my house yesterday I was just getting ready to prepare lunch so I put it to immediate use. I made a chicken veggie dish with pasta. The pan did a great job! It held everything I could add to it with room to spare. Clean-up was a breeze as well. The recommendation by the manufacturer is to use plastic or wooden utensils but I used a metal spoon and sure enough, a few scratches showed up but booklet that came with the pan says that these scratches won't impair the performance."
5,A Perfect Pan,"I've had it several months now and use it a couple times a week. Its size, depth, and shape make it the perfect choice for curries, chile con carne, and similar dishes. I also enjoy cooking in it because it's so pretty ... it pleases me. I also find it very easy to clean, also a plus! Pay attention to the instructions to avoid high heat, though. I nearly burned my first curry in it. Since then, I cook on medium heat.Some reviews complain that it is too light weight, but it's just right for this 70 year old woman with severe arthritis and confined to a wheel chair. I would not be able to tolerate a heavier pan."
5,Valentin Cake Pan,The cake was easy to remove from the pan and was perfect. I took it to a party and everyone was amazed at the detail of the cake. I only added a drizzle glaze.
5,the birthday men,she will love it when i made it on .feb the 14 i will buy cakepan i love it the pan
3,"Beautiful pan, but it is MADE IN CHINA","I called Wilton to find out where this pan is manufactured. The reply: China. :(I love the design of this pan and it was on my buy list, but the made in China detail tipped the scale towards a Nordic Ware pan that is made in America.The Wilton phone rep said the company is looking into bringing some of their manufacturing back to the USA. So, if manufacturing on this cake pan moves back to the USA and puts American workers back to work, I will buy it.While this review isn't about this pans performance during a cooking trial, some prospective buyers may want to know this specific heart pan is manufactured in China at this time."
1,Cheaply made,"I am very, very, very unhappy with this product. It came in little pieces and with sharp edges once you broke or cut the parts off of a plastic mold. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,"Horrible purchase, wont recommend","Well first, the picture showed green color but it came in blue. Now I ordered this for my gal and she wud have to leave with blue. Next assembly was a real pain. Dont know why they cant ship all items in zipped bags but want you to cut each item. The dishwasher and oven door doesn't open/close smooth and u have to literally apply pressure and that may topple the unit over. All in all, poor purchase and will not recommend. Put few extra bucks and get a better one."
3,It's Okay,"There were a lot of pieces to put together it only took about an hour. There are two things I don't like about this kitchen the oven door. When you open and close it, it seems like its going to break off, but so far it hasn't and the faucet it doesn't snap on it's just there for you to take off and lose."
2,"Nice ""corner"" kitchen for size, bad quality of plastic","I thought I would save some money and buy a cheaper kitchen for my daughter. I would suggest that you spend the extra money and get a higher quality toy. The ""faucet"" immediately broke off, the doors are very thin and feel like they will break at any moment. The kitchen falls over very easily if your toddler gets even a little rowdy. I was not impressed at all with the quality of this item. I liked that it fit in a corner and wasn't so bulky but it is very ""cheap""."
3,Average toy with nightmare assembly,"Once the kitchen was assembled my toddler loved it, but of course she was waiting patiently through 3 features of Kung Fu Panda before I was able to complete assembly. I'm not one to shy away from assembling product, in fact I enjoy it, but this was just a nightmare. When you open up the box, there's just a mess of plastic molded sheets of parts. I'm pretty sure there were at least 100 components you had to cut apart or break off. Once the components were broken off, I had to go back and trim the little sharp plastic pieces sticking out. I was so worried that my daughter would cut herself if she grabbed anything I had forgotten to trim. Putting it all together was better than trimming everything, I had to use a drill so I could finish it quickly. Overall she likes it alot, but I find it unacceptable that a company would place out products that could potentially hurt the children."
2,1000 Peices!!! Hard for children to open doors.,I thought this would come in maybe 15 peices no about 1000 little plastic parts. very annoying. The doors donot open well without almost taking the whole item with it. now whats the fun it it? Cheeply made.
4,Good product for good price,"""Spend Money Save Time, Spend Time Save Money""I bought this for my 2 year old. She LOVES it. It isn't the best quality but that's to be expected at this price point. Assembly does take a while. The plastic ""stumps"" that another reviewer spoke of are easily shaved off with a pocket knife. If you are handy, don't hesitate to buy this."
4,"Nightmare to put together, but my 3 y/o loves it.","This literally took about four hours to put together, and I think I'm fairly handy at putting kids toys together. My three-year-old son loves it, though - so I guess it's all worth it now."
5,Another Great Made in USA toy by American Plastics,Love this MADE IN USA TOY! Purchaed this for our 16 month old daughter and she went straight to it and started cooking. YES it DOES take quite a bit of assembly but with a couple people it is not too bad. Most spots on it you can use a cordless drill to make it go faster.
2,WAY too hard to assemble!!,"This was the WORSE toy I have ever had to put together in my life!! It is very cheap made, and comes in sheets of plastic. You have to cut the parts off of the sheets and then, EVERY single piece has to be screwed together. It is ridiculous!! It took me 3 hours to put it together, and then to top it off, it was so cheaply made that not worked smoothly. The doors don't close smoothly, the phone falls apart, and it is just a horrible mess. I will never buy anything from this company again. TRUST ME, DON""Y BUY THIS!! Oh, yeah, and it wasn't ""American Made"", it was made in China, and you can tell."
1,Assembly nightmare,"I'm really glad I started assembly of this product days in advance of Christmas. It would have been an awful Christmas eve if I'd started it then, after the kids were a'bed.It was a nightmare to assemble. Not hard, really. Just WAY too many pieces, all in their little fabrication ""clusters"", that had to be located, snapped, screwed, etc. I have a Ph.D. in a science field, and it took me THREE HOURS to assemble this $50 toy. There's got to be a better way. And if it all falls apart in three days (which I expect it will), I'll be taking it back to the store.My advice....spend a little extra money and buy something better. Preferably, something made of wood or laminate, with fewer pieces. Open the box and look inside before chosing this product."
3,Do NOT Wait Until Christmas Eve to Assemble!,"We bought this for our four year old granddaughter's birthday. My nephew, who is the family handy man and is above average in put together intelligence, spent four grueling hours assembling the kitchen as a four year old repeatedly asked- ""Is it ready, yet?"" When completed, we were fairly well satisfied, although some pieces seemed a bit warped (but not too bad). We live in a tornado area and we joked that when the sirens go off next time for everyone to crawl in this kitchen as there are enough screws in the thing to hold together during a tornado! I guess we got what we paid for, but had the assembly been left for someone other than my nephew, it would have been a tragedy. I have NEVER seen so many parts. Then when it was assembled, he had to take a razor and clean off all the sharp edges of the utensils and plates. It seems as if at least they could have come in a packet."
1,You get what u pay for.,"Everything about it is not cool. The plastic is not sturdy which is a given. But considered you have to line up everything and then screw, the plastic parts don't align. It's not that hard to put it together. But as I am assembling, I realize how much it would have been better if I had gotten my daughter something that will last a long time. this is soooo thin. The small parts are too tiny for the spots where it's supposed to go. I can go on and on but the bottom line is I bought something cheap and I regret it. If I can give 0 on it's quality I would. Now my daughter gets irritated everytime she tries to open the little doors because it just comes off. Poor thing tries to fix it on her own and when she can't she calls me. The time she's playing should be the time I can do chores. This is the most useless toy ever."
3,Not worth the set- up.,"I expected that there would be some assembly, but this was a nightmare. Even the tiniest of pieces was attached to a sheet of plastic pieces. There are over 1000 tiny pieces that are attached to plastic sheets in no order. So for one tiny part like the oven knob, you have to locate 4 different tiny pieces that are lost in a mess. Every single part was like that. And all of the parts were difficult to break off. 1/2 the time was spent snipping and sanding edges to make it safe. It took me 4 hours and 15 minutes to assemble. And I was furious when it was complete and I realized that the entire thing fits in the box it came in!! Just ridiculous and a dificult item to make safe to use. If I had known this would've happened I would not have purchased it. With that said, my 2 year old son loves to play pretend chef and it's so cute when he brings me a plate of plastic eggs and yells ""mommy, I made you dessert!"""
3,Good for the price,"I bought this kitchen for my 1 year old daughter after reading many other reviews about it. It really does come in TONS of pieces and took almost 2.5 hours to assemble. One of the doors was a bit warped and does not open real easy. I would say to definitely have a wire cutters to get the pieces separated to avoid sharp edges. But, that being said, my daughter loves it! She plays with it all the time. I think it is a good product for the price. Just make sure you have lots of patience and time on hand to put it together."
2,Wasted childhood,Buy the time I was done putting this together my 1 year old son had grown old enough to use the real kitchen to make my wife and I a 7 course thanksgiving dinner. Only buy this product if you are cool with locking your kid up for years so they dont try to swallow any of the thousands of pieces laying around the house during construction.
4,Took forever to put together but worth it.,I'm not going to lie. This kitchen took me forever to put together and I almost killed my fiance in the process. Wear a glove when you cut the pieces out because I got blisters from using the scissors so much.The edges when you cut the pieces out are a bit sharp but if you take the extra time to sand them they are as good as new. When we finally put it together I couldn't complain. For the price it was def. worth it. and my daughter loves it (1st birthday present). Just make sure you give your self plenty of time to put it together!
4,It is ok,"For the price it is ok, but I think it will not hold up long once it is played with. The doors, etc are flimsy. It would take a lot of care to keep it in one piece"
4,Nice little play kitchen,"Bought this for a friend for xmas. I got it for $34 and it is worth that price, I dont think I would pay much more for it though, would then go to the bigger version. Took me 3 hours to assemble and I am good at putting stuff together. The biggest issue is getting all the pieces apart from each other as it comes right from the plastic mold so have some clippers on hand....I didnt and used a kitchen knife. Parts went together good and found it to be pretty sturdy. Could see some things breaking if used inappropriately. Otherwise is a good product. My friend says her daughter loves it and cooks for everyone."
3,It's an OK Kitchen,"I purchased this kitchen for my toddler and he seems to like it. Although, it was a little frustrating putting it together, I did manage to work my magic after a couple of hours. I normally don't mind putting things together, but many of the pieces did not fit properly. Overall, I rate this product average. It does not have any real ""fun effects"" or neat gadgets, so an over excited toddler may find it a little boring. It's one of those toys that's nice to look at, but not all that fun to play with."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I would like to just say that I was really excited to find a kitchen for so cheap! Then it all went downhill from there. It took my husband and I 2 hours on Christmas eve to assemble this thing. It is full of cheap plastic parts that aren't durable at all, and very flimsy for what they are for. Yeah it works. Yeah my daughter enjoyed it, but I would not buy it again. I am currently looking for a much better quality one that is going to last."
1,1000 Piece Plastic Nightmare!,My wife purchased this at Wal Mart for Christmas and it is a miserable experience for parents to assemble. Sheet after sheet of mass stamped plastic pieces that must be cut out with something stronger than scissors. I am serious when I say the pieces are endless! It has taken several hours just to cut them out! I have not even gotten to the point of trying to assemble this mess and I know it is not going to go well or look anything like it does on in the picture. My wife just found the recipe and I am going to pack it all back in the box and try to return it. Avoid this product and the pain it inflicts!
1,Not worth it.,Package arrived all beat up. Missing hardware and stick-on stickers for oven. Will cost me money to ship back which is no fault of my own which really sucks. Package was so beat up I had to make major repairs to ship it back. Looks like package was already returned from a previous purchase and nobody checked the package to make sure all parts were in the package before selling it again. Looks like somebody is making money by having this package shipped back and forth.
1,Took 2 City Engineers 3 hours to put together,"This item is in a million little pieces. Even the door knobs are in at least two pieces. The only thing put together is the flat part of the base, countertop and top of the kitchen. I work for the government and bought this item for a needy child. I heard it might be difficult to put together so decided on the day the presents were due to open it before wrapping and put it together. To my sheer horror everything was little pieces that had to be twisted off of sheets. An engineer happened by and was amazed at the planning required to even make this kitchen so complex. He and a buddy helped while I untwisted individual pieces and handed them to them like a nurse helping a doctor with medical instruments in surgery. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
2,Just put it in the recycle bin,"I bought this product about a year or so ago for my niece, she did get some play out of it, but later walked away from it. The assembly was somewhat of a nightmare when compared to other play kitchens and it was not truly kid friendly. The plastic parts are difficult to assemble as well as move once the whole thing is put together. When you open the doors to the oven or the fridge, they tend to fall off and have to be snapped back into place, something which is not ideal when dealing with 3 year olds. Her mother ended up buying her a new kitchen, and we decided to put it into the recycle bin rather than donate, because so many parts fell off and/or went missing in its short use."
3,For the price...,"We were looking to get a kitchen for my two year old son, but didn't want to spend $70-$200 on something he might get sick of in a few months. Grandpa got him this, and yes, it took an hour and a half to assemble, and it's not top of the line, but my son enjoys it, and when he stops playing with it, I won't feel like it was a waste of money when I pass it on to someone else. So, over all, it's not horrible."
1,TOTTALY DISSATISFIED WITH THE. HM. STYLE KITCHEN,THE KITCHEN IS MADE OFCHEAP PLASTIC AND THE ACCESSARIES HAVE TO BE CUT OFF A MOLDED FORM.iN DOING THIS IT LEAVES SHARP EDGES ON ALL THE ACCESSARIES & DOORS. i BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER ANDSHE SLICED HER PALM ON ONE OF THE JAGGED EDGES. i WOULD LIKE IT REPLACED EVEN IF i HAVE TO PUT OUT MORE MONEY TO UPGRADE TO BETTER QUAilty.
2,not worth the money,"its alot smaller than you would think. its a good size for a 2 or 3 year old but thats it, most play dishes are to big for it and it does have alot of sharp edges. it falls over very easy too"
1,Horrible!,when i received it the box was damaged. besides that there were a million pieces to put together and it was cheaply made.I returned this item
4,Great fun but assembly definitely required!!,"My little girl is about 2 1/2 yrs old and loves bugging mommy and daddy in the kitchen! This was a gift to her and us! :) In that sense, it works well. She Loves it and is always ""making"" us stuff. However, when we first received it, there was a LOT of assembly required. I think it took me and the wife around 3-4 hrs to assemble it! She got it started and lasted about an hour. Fed up, she came and got me. I'm fairly handy and figured (smugly) it would be a piece of cake... It wasn't. Pretty tedious and time consuming. LOTS of parts and the directions are mainly pictographs. All in all it works as intended. Best for the price! But look out for sharp edges where the plastic molds were broken that could easily cut little hands. I used a metal file to file down the sharp tabs and problem solved! Nothing was missing/all parts were there and the quality is what you expect for the price."
4,Great toy for a great price!,"So many say this toy was difficult to put together but we didnt think it was to bad, took us less than 2 hours to completely assemble. I love the price and that it was gender neutral. As a foster parent I have many kids enter my home and some are destructive yet none have destroyed this toy. It seems very durable and was a big hit at our house."
2,Three hours to assemble; not very high quality,I spent 3 hours on Christmas Eve assembling this (didn't read the reviews here). It made for a very grumpy Christmas day. It's not very high quality--jagged edges on many pieces. I highly recommend purchasing something else.
3,toy kitchen,This little kitchen can keep a little girl busy for hours. But for the price we gave for it. It could have been a little more durable. It is a little cheap made and had alot of little pieces to punch out and put together.
3,Looks better on the screen.,"The product looks great online, but the quality was not quite what I had expected. I should have known that I would get what I paid for - the price was great and the product does it's job for my 16 month old. I would spend more next time to get better quality."
4,"Cheap quality, but what you expect for $39.99","It just happen that my 4 year old son likes to help in the kitchen when my wife and I are cooking. I tried to put it together in a morning and it did not happen. It is way complicated to put together. The instructions are not clear enough. Be carefull fitting the pieces, since the quality is not that great i ended up breaking some of the pieces while putting together. I did not put a lot of force into trying to fit the pieces, however they cracked. I ended up going to the store to exchange it, however they just happen to run out of them. Since my son still did not get a kitchen set, I ordered it online at Amazons for the same price. I will write another review when I get it and put it together one more time."
1,Find a better one!,"The previous review describing assembly issues was right on, in our opinion. We did the rookie parent thing and waited until Christmas Eve to assemble it- wow- we won't make that mistake again!!! It was awful, never really looked finished, and was difficult for our daughter and her friends to use (the doors, for example, never opened and closed properly- you had to pull them until it seemed like they were going to break).As far as the molded parts go, the were AWFUL!!! I had to get out an exacto knife and shave off all of the VERY SHARP remnants from the frames- and there are a ton of pieces to this set. Also, the phone won't stay together, not that I'm entirely sure I understand why all kitchen sets now include a phone anyhow.To sum it up, there are lots of other kitchen sets out there that would be a lot better for your family."
4,Not bad for $35,"This kitchen requires TOTAL assembly (I mean cutting all the parts off the plastic molding trees like a plastic model car). You then must screw it all together. Directions are mostly clear and logical. It took me about 90 minutes to put the whole thing together. Once assembled the kitchen is pretty sturdy and it is very well designed. And, it's made in America! How many plastic toys are made in the good ole' USA? For the price, this is well worth it. Just don't expect Step 2 or Little Tykes quality (or price)!"
1,Takes forever to put together,"This play kitchen just takes way too long to put together. You have to pul apart all the parts. And, there are many, many parts.It's not the most durable playset either.I wish I had just forked out more money to buy a wooden set"
5,Odds and Ends.,"I happend to stumble onto this import in my local record store in the ""used"" section believe it or not. If you haven't collected all the Saint Etienne albums this is a good sampler of some of their pre-Good Humor stuff. I have heard a few of these track before (i.e Fox Base Alpha, and So Tough), but a few where new to me and they turned out to be pretty good.Most of the album's content still have the House/hip-hop sound circa F.B.A and S.T. If you feel like listening to their earlier work (which I often do) pop this record on and you will not be disappointed. Although it dose not replace their first three releases, it's a good ""Best Of"" from Saint Etienne's past."
5,Wonderful music,"Hello,I wasn't familier with Larcange's vinyls before nor his music but I do own some albums/collections of music that are neary the same sound and atmosphere like this one.I am a fan of accordion music and looking for such kind of music whenever I can.This album (or should I say 2 albums) is a very realxed, calm, moving music; the orchestra adds a very special, flowing touch to the accordionist.There is also the chorus that gives another level of athmosphere to the music. There is no singing but only changing levels (""hums"") of all singers - a well known background singing in those days. Great !I would recommend anyone who like that kind of music to buy and enjoy this CD. Put it in your cd player, press play, pour yourself a cup of something :) and let the music surround you...Omer."
1,very bad affair,"this mold had problem to be used, it doesn't close easily and you have to try several time till it does , not good affair"
5,Early Americana Feel,"This is an esthetically pleasing, functional work of art. I bought it for my brother and his fiancee. She prepares all food raw."
2,so small and the lid is the bottom of the pan,"When i order it i didn't imagine is so small, it's to make a cookie for 1 person. And the lid is the same thing with the bottom of the pan. So the only time that you can use the lid is after you put the pan ( with the cookie ) on a plate, because you don't have the bottom of the pan anymore."
5,Great R&B project,"I LOOOOOOVE this record. It's great all the way through. I am going to order another one. I played it so much, that my favorite cuts are skipping. I love MS. Doss!"
5,Conya's best,"I bought this CD twice. When I got an IPOD, I downloaded it and gave the CD's to the Salvation Army. Why did I do that??????????? I've lost the songs and I want this CD again. As you can see, Conya isn't releasing anymore copy's, so this CD is extremely hard to find. When you do find it, it's extremely in demand; therefore, very expensive. If you get this CD, do not ever let it go!"
5,Amazing lyrical content,"The best rapper out there right now. Mike Jones deff got wrecked on this album, shouldn't have thought his ""Who? mike jones"" stuff was top of the line. If you've never hard of him then you need to pick up his stuff he'll blow ur mind."
5,the best Chamillionaire,"yeah, this is my personal favorite of Chamillionaire. 3 Cds that are off tha m-fing chayne. my mayne at his best. for those feelin cham check out 50/50 twin. He gonna blow big. Lyrically he dope and i gonna say this.....he even better than Cham."
4,The Christian Home School by Gregg Harris,I was not considering home schooling at all until I read this book. The author is very direct in his own personal opinions and I had to remember that this is one person's opinion yet I was feeling very convicted and challenged as I read. The book is also very encouraging especially to those of us who have never thought we could homeschool. The author gives alot of suggestions for curriculum as well as additional reading on the subject. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic.
3,Not the best..........,"I actually did not care for this book. I have homeschooled my daughter for 2 1/2 years and I needed to read a few books on homeschooling for a course I was going through. If you are new to homeschooling, I think there are alot better books out there. Overall, I agreed with most of the book, but, I felt it was pretty extreme and not for the average Christian. I felt there wasn't enough useful information for the person starting out. Instead, there was too much information on starting a family business, etc. Although starting a family business may be a good thing for some, it isn't the main thing a family starting out in homeschooling desires."
3,"Good story, bad drama!","So, Jack Deth helps his future daughter Josphine continue kill those Tranchers..... Not saying how! But if you like futuristic science fiction with low drama, this movie is for you!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"For a B movie, it's an A...","...but it's still a B movie.It should be noted that I did not hear the movie; I am nearly deaf and this flick does not have subtitles.This is the one where they ""upgrade"" (pr downgrade, or degrade, however you see it) Jack Deth to Jo Deth. I heard that Yvette Sullivan was cute, which does not do her justice, and I kind of like the idea of switching over from one actor to another to play the same role -- kind of like in Dr. Who. Or James Bond. No question that there was only ONE Jack Deth and Jo can't compete on his level, but she had him beat elsewhere.For instance: she's wicked awesome hot.All the usual cliches are here, minus the car chase, which is required by law in most of these films."
3,Fake looking snake,"My husband bought this for some reason. It scared the crap out of me when I first saw it in the box. Then upon closer inspection, you see the goofy face drawn on it and you feel silly for being scared."
4,Halloween prop,"I bought these for Halloween Party props. They are very realistic and well made - painting is neatly done, not sloppy like a lot of these kinds of toys. It will be great for my purpose. Not sure how much fun it would be as a toy, but I guess you could scare someone with it. Might also work in a tree to keep critters away."
1,HORRIBLE unit,"I'm on my 3rd unit, returned to sams club twice, and will return the 3rd unit today - it is absolutely horrible. Skipping is an issue of when, not if. After a few weeks, the slightest of road bump will make your disk go to the beginning. Irritation and rowdy kids ensue...."
1,Not the same unit but a Venturer,"My unit is a double screen unit with the same problem, the tab wouldn't let me open the door to my unit. I could use it but I'd have to put a book ontop of the unit so that it wouldn't open. After a month it was just totally shot, the DVD wouldn't even spin. I'm satisfied to say if I tried to get a hold of the manufacuter they would blow me off. I'm taking back to Radio Shack where I bought it. I would steer clear of this name brand."
1,GREAT PRICE.....LOUSY EVERYTHING ELSE!!,"I purchased this dual dvd player for my twins. At first, all went well, with the exception of faded color in one unit. Within a few months, one player started to skip. Every bump in the road restarted the video...all the way back to the previews!!! Next, the velcro no longer kept the cover shut...this happened to both units. I put my own velcro tabs in, but eventually had to resort to rubber bands. Now, one unit is dead...black screen, and the bottom of the other unit is hanging on by a thread. I NEVER transferred these units. They hung in the same car! What a waste of money! I DO NOT recommend this product. Now in the market for a new one...any suggestions???!!!"
1,Waste of Money,I bought this product at Sams and it worked great for about a month. Then it started to skip every once in a while. Now you can't even breath near it without it skipping. This product is a complete waste of money. I am very upset that I invested in this product. I will never buy Venturer again. Sams should be ashamed of selling this.
1,Don't buy Venturer products!,"I made that mistake; don't waste your money on Venturer junk - worst customer service I can remember (well, if you buy Venturer you are going to need it)."
3,"Decent USB hub, complements a white iMac really well","I was at Microcenter buying a few accessories and impulsively decided to purchase the IOGEAR USB hub. I was in a pinch and knew I was overpaying, but I needed the hub. I definitely wish I would have read the reviews on Amazon first. I completely agree with the other reviewers, the stand is fairly useless and does not match the product at all. The product itself is a great complement to my white iMac, but there was clearly too much focus on the appearance and not enough on the overall design of the hub."
1,IOGEAR GUH227 7 Port High Speed USB 2.0 Hub,"I had one around 2008 and ports 1-4 went bad. They still work just to charge a cell phone or MP3 player but that is about it. There was a storm a few days before but the hub still worked after power came back up. It was less than a week later when the ports stopped working. I contacted IOGear to get a replacement but was denied because I didn't have the receipt. I really liked the hub since it worked well so I decided to go and buy another of the same one. Less than a year later the same ports 1-4 stopped working. Since it doesn't look like I am the only one having this issue and this is the second one with the same issue, I think this device is really flawed. Sucks because it worked really well when it did."
4,Almost perfect,"I don't use the cheap little rubber stand that came with it, it works and installs easily. It is very useful when you have several usb devices."
2,Disappointed,I've had this hub for a year and one-by-one each of the ports stopped working. It is useless. The base is not effective.
2,worked great until it failed,"I needed more USB ports so I bought this device. It worked great for about 6 months. Now four of the seven ports do not work. I have rebooted and unplugged and tried different troubleshooting advice but still the front two ports and top two ports in the back do not work. The base is light and doesn't hold the port up but I can deal with that if the thing worked. I am going to trash this one and buy a different brand 7 port USB hub. Hopefully, I will have better luck next time."
3,Nice but Flawed,"The style of this hub nicely compliments Mac computers and others. What is disappointing is the dark grey base. The base is not integrated with hub at all. The base, made of a rubber material, is very light. This means the 7 USB cables and accessories you have are all tugging on it in various directions. This makes the hub unstable and prone to flopping over."
5,!!! shea butter !!!,"I love this stuff!! It smells fantastic, it moisturizes without even a tiny bit of greasiness, and it can be used for hands, feet, lips, and even hair!!! I scrunch a little into my hair when its wet and sometimes use it to smooth frizz. Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointed,"I've read several books on Astral Travel. This book was a disappointment with less than 100 pages in large print. At one point, the author refuses to discuss separation techniques because those are reserved for the advanced occultist. Then author(s) uses the rest of the book to discuss astral travel after separation. This book is pure occult fantasy. I suggest books authored by Robert Monroe, Robert Bruce, or Robert Peterson"
3,Might be good for you,"Buy this book if you're interested in reading about the astral plane. As far as technique goes, ""Astral Dynamics"" by Robert Bruce is far and away superior."
4,totally satisfied,"this is a very good book, directly they speak about the topic with good tutorials. most books has unwanted stuff, but this is a very small book with so much to learn. i think this is a very good book for the people who new to this subject and for the one who want to start it."
2,I didn't like it,"This book seems to be a reprint of an older one. The writing is that really rhetorical kind that just goes on and on. It also seemed jumbled and unorganized, I had trouble reading this one, I had to let it go. I still give it two stars for the sheer audacity."
1,Never buy used!,"I thought I was buying a new player but received a refurbished set. There was battery corrosion in the terminals and the buttons were so warn they were impossible to read. The unit worked sporadically, for a short time, then not at all. I apparently missed the 30-day return policy so they are being recycled. I have other Panasonic players that I enjoy and have been durable. I suspect that quality is not consistent across company lines due to using multiple manufacturers."
2,Design could be better,"This player works well, especially if you like listening to CDs and don't want to purchase the high priced MP3 players. Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages to the design.The advantages:1. Inexpensive way to listen to CDs and MP3s. A CD can store quite a number of songs (at least 175 MP3s).2. Supports playlists.3. Slim design.The disadvantages:1. Adaptor not included.2. Short headphone cord. Company is assuming you want to use the display adaptor, which is not always the case.3. There is no display directly on the player.4. The headphones that come with it sound much better plugged directly into player instead of through the display module.5. Buttons on player are small and hard to distinguish."
2,Descent product but poor support and availability of accessories,"I have been searching for the rechargeable NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride) battery HHR-4AGA/2B that Panasonic recommends in the user manual for the past 2 weeks. This battery is not available in stores like Best Buy, Circuit City, Walmart, Target, Radioshack...how does Panasonic expect people to get replacements.I called Panasonic today and the person I talked to said they dont understand what the part number was!! What a joke! Finally they were able to give me a price $9.00+ shipping (probably more than the battery)+ tax....I think this is a big rip off.Personally I'm thinking of replacing this product. Doesnt make sense to buy something and have to spend a forture on non-rechargeable batteries. I dont have much of a choice with rechargeables..because other than the HHR-4AGA/2B nothing will charge in this system.Wont recommend people to buy it...unless you are willing to spend extra money on a separate charger + batteries."
3,awkward to use,"This is a middle of the road CD/MP3 player. I purchased this player for my gym workouts, and it's been a little dissapointing. I will start off by saying that the sound is great, cd's don't skip, no problems with performance. My complaint is really with the design. The battery unit, in an exterior case, makes the player awkward to put on a treadmill or epilitical trainer, frequently causing the player to fall. The controls on the player are on the side, and very difficult to read. The player does have a digital read-out along with the MP3, but you really can't read it during a work-out because it's attached to your clothing. The other problem I've had is interchanging headphones. Most are not compatible with the MP3 player, and without that MP3/digital read out plug in, the player doesn't work."
1,Wasn't happy with this item.,"This mp3 player didn't work properly since I received it. I tried getting a return label for it, but couldn't. I would still try to return it."
2,Cost effective so far then the ink disappeared,"Received the ink relatively quickly.Only needed to install the black ink for now,but after some modest use the capacity of the inkis dwindling faster than the stock Epson cartridges.I would still order these again in spite of the lowervolume of ink within them due to the affordable price.Not disappointed at all.I'm using the Epson Stylus c88+ printer.UPDATE: 2-2-2010THESE CARTRIDGES RAN OUT WAY TO FASTWHEN REALIGNING THE PRINT HEADS IT WOULD USE UP 25% OF THE INK TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS. THEY WORK BUT THEY ULTIMATELY BECAME A HASSLE. I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND AND FIND THEM TO BE A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. HAD TO ORDER FROM A DIFFERENT SUPPLIER.THANKS BUT NO THANKS"
2,"Accurate, but preachy","I ordered this book out of concern for my ninth grade students who are considering/experimenting with vegetarianism. As one who declines red meat, and is gradually phasing out fish and fowl, I found the book accurate, but too preachy. Any reference book a student picks up ""for fun"" needs to be hip, interesting, eye-catching, and must, at all costs, avoid talking down to the reader. My students have responded far better to Judy Krizminac's ""A Teen's guide to Going Vegetarian."""
1,Absolutely Apalling!,"I'm a new teen vegetarian who wanted to read this book for more information. I was appalled at the way it treated vegetarianism--like just another diet to help you slim down! It hardly mentioned environmental, ethical, or moral reasons for becoming a vegetarian. According to the book, ""Just follow Dr. Salter's plan and enjoy the healthier, slimmer you that will emerge."" This is sending completely the wrong message to teens. Vegetarianism is not a just a diet--it is a whole new lifestyle. I definetly do not recommend this book. Their are many others that offer information on ALL aspects of vegetarianism, and in a less condescending way. I can just say that I'm glad I got this book at the library instead of wasting any money on it."
2,"Neat sub, but an altogether lacking program...","Sure, if I had 3 million dollars and top engineers at my disposal, I could do some impressive things too. I think his submarine idea has a great deal of merit and potential for the future of scientific study and oceanic understanding, but I question this guy's real motives... To me he just came across as a big-kid toy junkie looking to make a buck. I'm surprised the folks at NOVA didn't do more with oh, I don't know... the SCIENTIFIC angle of this subject, perhaps??? Instead it was much ado about little, and more to do with this guy's ego-based pet project."
2,"Ugh, what a terrible Nova episode.","This was such a dissapointment. While the story does seem to capture the stress and innovation of this creative process, the structure of the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. The biggest narrative hole was leaving the resolution of the hull leak unexplained. And in the end, all we get to see is the bottom of some murky british coastal waters... zzzz.... I could have just sprayed green paint on my reading glasses and gotten the same effect. Hasn't the sub been taken to more interesting waters? Or did the billionaire's goal merely consist in constructing a groundbreaking machine so that he could then shelve it next to his army tank and other world war memorabilia?"
1,Hey! Thats not Fair!,"Oi, yea you, Gilmore Girl. I can't believe you accused ME of calling ""That's So Raven"" gay! I mean, this is my first review EVER on Amazon.com, and I am offended that you said I called the show gay. It was not me, it was Bent Tony. BEN WITH A T AT THE END!!! Jeez. I LOVE this show, because I have nothing better to do with my life. And Bent Tony, I agree that Cory liking Oysters and Eddie liking Snails AND Oysters is just creepy (and, for Gilmore Girl's knowledge, that is CREEP WITH A Y AT THE END.) And really, I love Raven. I own every DVD AND VHS (that's a video, Gilmore Girl) and every stinkin Music CD that SHE HAS DONE. Every movie on DVD and VHS, watching Disney every night watching Raven. Jeez! You tell ME something of Raven and I bet you I own it or it is coming from Best Buy or something. Wow, I need to find another hobby...RAVEN! RAVEN! RAVEN! (For President.)"
2,That`s so stupid!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don`t like this show. Only a few episodes were good and funny. And the episodes is when Raven made a huge pizza, and the episode when Stanley ruined they`re movie marathon and beat Cory in ping-pong. I like the part when Chelsea hit the ball hard and it went through the thing. That was funny. The rest suck.And this show is kind of nasty because on some episodes they be showing some nasty scenes and stuff. I wish i can give this a 1 star product but i`ll give it 2 because i have 2 favorite good episodes. And i`m not a fan of Raven."
5,RAVEN ROCKS!,"I think That's so Raven is the best show in the history of television and anyone who says it's not is totally stupid!Who cares if Ravens dad is a producer or whatever. Raven got that part cos she's the best actress EVER! I don't have the DVD but if Ravens in it then i totally recomend it. Also Chelsea is soooooooooo hilarious. So is Eddie. My favourite episodes are:the one where all the pupils are trying to impress someone they think is from undercover superstar and everyone is singing. I loved Chelseas song the best! ""all alone in the hallways as always, just the stairwell the lockers and me"". Sorry got a bit carried away. Also the episode with little Stanely handcuffs Raven to him and they both sing in the Chill Grill! Stanely is so cute. also the one with......Oh there is no time to say them all, it would take a million years! I think the whole cast and crew are amazin and i thank them for bringing me television joy! THATS SO RAVEN TOTALLY ROCKS!!!!"
5,Excellent quality,"Excellent quality, and brang back so many great memories while watching this show. I watched it with my cousin and we laughed on and on!"
5,Great Deck at a low price - w/stereo audio in back and front,"The front panel controls and remote are great. Computergeektoys' review gave this deck one star because the he/she says stereo audio outputs aren't on the back of the unit. Mine certainly does have stereo audio connections both in back and front. Sylvania makes an almost identical deck (6240, I believe) except its audio is mono. Perhaps computergeektoys confused the two decks?"
4,"Good, Simple, Little Machine","This is a very good VCR for the purchase price. It's elemental and not technically complex which was what I wanted since my goal is simply to view tapes and do some recording. I purchased a Phillips DVD/VCR combo, the VCR part of which started having trouble a little over a year after I got it. Later, I was told by someone knowledgeable that integrated units usually have a short life. My plan for the future is to have seperate units even though I have to switch cables one to another when I use them. I'm not a technophile so I like this machine. The picture quality is no worse and a little better than many VCRs I've used. I have a lot of tapes that I don't want to replace with DVDs so I'm happy I bought this unit before VCRs become extinct."
2,"You get what you pay for, NOT MUCH","This is a cheap Sylvania VCR. You get what you pay for in the VCR. If you get it you HAVE to use RCA cables, because the mono picture and sound is horrible. Then when you use the RCA cables the sound is considerably muted. Consider this, when I watch regular TV without the VCR my remote volume level is 7-8, when I use the VCR to just hear from about 6ft away I have to turn it up to 14-15, big difference in sound quality, and that's with 24k gold cables. I used to have a Sylvania that worked fine for 10 years, then it just crapped out on me, I thought this was going to be a fine replacement, man has VCR quality changed a lot in the last 8 or 9 years since I last bought one. If you use a VCR a lot to tape shows or whatever, I wouldn't recommend this, I found a Sanyo VCR for the same price at an electronics store, that has about 10 features this VCR doesn't have, plus better picture and sound."
4,Excellent for the price,"Excellent performance so far - keeping in mind that this is a ""vanilla"" VCR. Picture and sound quite good. Very small and very light. Product does look and feel very ""plastic"" so it might not be a good choice if it is to be put in an abusive situation. In my opinion, the bottle line is - If you need to be surrounded by bleeding edge gadgetry, this product isn't for you. If you need a utilitarian VHS VCR and you don't plan to throw it around, this is a great product for the price."
4,Spiffy,"For fifty bucks, you can't go wrong. Yes, the EP has been eliminated when it should have been the SLP. Still, SLP provides very good black and white recordings and good color recording --except for movies.Yes, the remote is too small, too much multi-tasking, which requires that I keep the instruction sheet handy.All in all, an excellent bargain."
1,Hi Fi VCR with Mono Output,"It's next to impossible to find a VCR deck only these days. They all come bundled with a DVD player which I already own and don't need another. So I was happy to see Sylvania still has a single VCR deck for sale. But my joy soon faded as I opened the box and began to plug in all the connections. The picture only shows the front of the deck but if it showed the back you would see there are only 2 RCA connections--one for video and one for audio. Yes, ONE for audio! This is advertised as a HiFi and 4 head deck which makes the buyer automatically assume it has stereo output.I went ahead anyway and plugged in everything just to see if I could live with it and was appalled at how horrible the sound really was. Not that it was mono only but it was of really poor quality. I couldn't take even 5 minutes of it so I returned the VCR.Don't waste your money on this deck."
5,"easy to install, easy to use",I give this machine five stars primarily on its easy install and use. Simply plug in the cords and the vhs player starts working. Adjusts tracking easily. I haven't personally used it to record anything so I cannot say how well that option works.
1,What is this thing anyway?,I wouldn't use this if this was the last produt that was left on th planet. Didn't work like I thought it should plus it had a noises in the bakground and lines through the sreen. I hae to buy a different brand beause of this!
1,Lousy VCR,While it worked the playback was fine. Then it went haywire -- refusing to play tapes -- ejecting them at will. Not allowing TV viewing while recording. Playing different channel audios to the wrong channel. Then the picture went fuzzy and it wouldn't allow the disc head tape to play. Lasted less than one year.
3,VCR review,"Although I was a little disappointed with the cheap look and feel of this machine, I have been pleased with the overall performance. The remote is a bit too much like a toy, but it is functional. I would most likely recommend this to a family or friend."
4,good VCR,"I own two of the Sanyo versions of these VCR's. They were manufactured as the SANYO vwm-950, and the Sylvania 6260vd. I have had one of these VCR's for 2 1/2 years now, and one for just over one year. Both are working well, play great, with good picture and sound. I have them fed into my surround sound system, and it is excellent to watch movies with. I highly recommend this vcr for a low cost good output, and reliable way to play your old videos. 4 heads, stereo input and output, easy to set up and use. Check these out, good buy."
3,VCR,"I bought this VCR as a replacement for a more expensive model for our bedroom which had worn out. For the price, the VCR works well. It comes with a remote control and the quality of recorded material is good."
2,Not what I expected,"The chandelier itself is lovely--it's the ""crystals"" that were disappointing. You cannot tell from the photo that the crystals are linked together with cheap looking pliable gold metal pieces. This cheapens the whole look. The shades were nice, but I may have to replace the lengths of crystal beading."
5,Letter writing Bible for every office and desk,"I was in Ms. Rodriques class at a local college and have had her book on every desk I've had since then. It is so tattered and torn from being used by everyone who touches it, that I have already ordered her latest edition before it has even been published! This is the easiest to use English book that I have ever seen. It was a workbook in class, but 8 years later, I still use it and other people call me all the time to look up grammatical questions. A must have for anyone interested in finding quick and easy explanations and answers to any grammatical question."
3,I wish they told you it's artificially sweetened,"I really don't like artificial sweeteners. I'm one of those people who can taste them, and the taste isn't pleasant. Well, this product, both the peach and regular, is artificially sweetened to the hilt. If you like artificial sweeteners, then it's fine, the product seems fine otherwise and my sister has been using for a long time and recommended it to me. But I really can't stand them, and just bought four bottles of this stuff. I'm drinking it, but it's like drinking medicine (to me). Just a heads up, since I've not found any ads really telling you explicitly that these are artificially sweetened. (Also, you can try adding some sugar, but since it's already sweet (fake sweet), if you add too much sugar it just gets gross.)"
5,Another album-on-a-whim gone right.,"The first time through I found ""Destination: Beautiful"" an unremarkable album with catchy pop hooks, but not much more; the second time through, it blew me away. While Mae will never be entered into the annals of innovative pop/rock, their first effort is innocent, earnest and optimistic. From the sincere and wistful ""All Deliberate Speed"" to the sugary but lovable ""Soundtrack for Our Movie,"" Mae provides music that maintains interest and just generally feels good. Easily one of the albums that would make the soundtrack of my life."
3,mae,"i found this on an interview online about the band. citybeat.com i think""We're not a Christian band. Some of the bands on Tooth and Nail tour in churches, but we don't. We don't play Christian-themed songs. If anything, we're on Tooth and Nail because they believe in our music. It doesn't have anything to do with religious beliefs. The long-term plan is to be on a bigger label. I don't know if there's a big Christian label or not, but we're not trying to get on one.""Mae's debut album showcases a moderate helping of catchy,melodic emo-pop tunes, that takes comparisons to Clarity era Jimmy Eat World and various other emo bands as some ambient U2-esque touches. There debut shines nicely in craft but they dont have much in skill and there sound that seems barebones. most of the albums effectiveness comes from production tricks and the harmonized vocals,and to be honest though they dont stand out too much. they would later utilize their skill and become more developed on Dest:B-sides and Everglow."
1,honestly i would've given it 3/4's a star,"JK JK JK JK JK YALL! THIS CD SOOOOO C00L MAN?!<3333 THE SONG EMBER AND ENVELOPES YO! TIZZIGHT SHIZZIE IN DA HIZZIE FASHO. YA SO IN CASE OF WONDERMENT AND PONDERMENT AND SUCH, I REALLY GIVE 93847534687345 STARS KTHNX. HAHA TRICKED U ALL I BET! WTF!?!SILLY GOOBER, TRIX AR3 FOR KIDZZZZZZZ. PAYCE"
4,Great CD,"I love Mae, so I appreciate anything they put out. However, I think I prefer ""The Everglow"" a bit more than this album. But with that said, ""Embers and Envelopes"" makes me smile and sing along each time it pops up in my play list."
1,was not expecting to see it stamped CHINA,"I have a old ""old timer"" that after 30 years is still a great knife. However thought a spare might be nice while they are still available. Or at least I thought still available. With a bit or googling seems the original company closed and the rights to some knives sold. Thus explaing why the blade no longer says USA but CHINA. Just think the CHINA information will be of interest to anyone buying this line because of any previous Schrade knife they may have purchased. It may or may not be as good as the original, just wish I had known this before. I only gave it 1 stars, not because of the quality of the knife which I cant judge because I only opened the package a few hours ago; but because I was not buying what I thought."
3,"WARNING - SAME book as ""Aha! Insight""","The following two books are 100% IDENTICAL:""Aha! Insight by Gardner, Martin"". ISBN: 071671017X&""Aha! Aha! Insight by Gardner, Martin"". ISBN: 0894540017Don't be fooled by the different ISBN's - the covers are identical and flipping through both books, the pages are identical.As for the book itself, I haven't had a chance yet to read it - I'm still trying to straighten out all the duplicates I have."
5,happy,my husband loves to fly and read about others adventures flying.that should be enough of a rating instead i have to have 18 words.
4,Start your day right,"A Morning Without Coffee is a delectable book of poetry designed to tempt and fill you to repletion with its sage, welcome words of faith and promise.It will awaken you to the joys surrounding you and gently encourage you to imbibe, sipping slowly at its overflowing verse and savouring its warming tanginess throughout the day for, once this book is picked up, you will wish to keep it at hand.This book is a warm and wonderful compilation of faith, love and courage.Flo is the poet and flow is what her verse does. Read and heed the wisdom imparted in each poem.We look forward to Flo Given's next book, hoping for some rich offerings to accompany the marvellous blend of verse already served, in A Morning Without Coffee."
5,"As Printed In The Alexandria Gazette Packet, Alexandria,VA.,","She Writes Poems That HealWith six other books already written, Florence Rosie Givens is excited about her first book that has recently been published- a collection of poems titled "" A Morning Without Coffee.""...Not only has writing helped Givens heal, but she writes poems for her friends that are facing difficult situations....Feedback from recipients of these healing poems have been positive....Her advice to single parents is, "" Reach out to the mountain of hope, that awaits their enthusiasm."""
3,"More power, less elevator....","I am a big fan of Daryl's -- especially after his solo on the last tour with Genesis. I was impressed with the power in that solo -- I thought this CD would be more of that but after the first 2 tracks, I couldn't help but think, ""....uh oh, it sounds like elevator music."" It's very relaxing if that's what you're looking for -- it's great for background music."
4,Not only for Genesis fans,"I am a fan of Genesis and to be sincere I expected something with a Genesis-like sound (in the style of Steve Hackett's album on Genesis revisited). However this is completely different. The album sounds like a jazz album (similar to Bob James and Earl Klugh songs and sometimes also to George Benson). And it is very nice to hear these songs with a different (yes, ""another side"") sound. This is a great album and I really liked it....perhaps I would have like other songs (I mean older ones) but it is OK."
1,"""Under God""?","If you're familiar with David Barton and Wallbuilders you'll understand where I'm coming from. I have not purchased this book, but I just looked at the preview pages and I see that they have taken the liberty to remove ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance. If that is a concern for you, as it is for me, you may want to think twice about ordering this book."
2,Please only work on other peoples stuff,"This album is terrible. While there are some very promising beats, Skateboard-P has a terrible flow, and his lyrics are a complete joke. Therefore you have all these songs that would have some potential if only someone else was rapping over them. Much like the cover art, a lot of the tracks here come across as cartoonish, and you just cant take them seriously. Go buy the Clipse album ""Hell Hath no Fury"" to hear what a Neptunes produced album with talented rappers sounds like."
2,Pharrell Is OUT Of His Mind,"Most of this album is unlistenable. I like the first single ""Can I Have It Like That"" with Gwen Stefani and the second single ""Number One"" with Kanye West, but the rest of the album doesn't hit it off. The production and guest apperances are top notch, but the lyrics and the SINGING of Pharrell just don't do it."
5,Pharrell is one of the best producers to ever do it!,He's among the best producers in hiphop and this is his solo debut. I must say his lyrics are clever and he keeps you entertained with his amazing beats. This is a unique album and it was nominated for album of the year and lost to Ludacris Release Therapy which was also a great album.
3,A weak 50/50 album full of R&B or Hip Hop.,"The album is just an effort that ended being re-worked over and over again but still with unsatisfied job basically cuz I considered lyrics are messed up and should have been re-written. Production slams on the door while synth sound goes off every time and the beats don't do well on Pharrell weak vocal skills. Some songs might take a little time for them to grow on you if you're not familiar with his work. If I had to choose the tracks that I think was okay would be:* How Does it Feel?* Best Friend* That Girl* Young Girl* Number OnePharrell said, ""This onez for the fans"", which I believe wasn't done with a lot of effort."
5,The beats are incredible!!!,"I have not yet purchased this cd but one of my friends has it and I listen to it over and over. I did not expect this kind of cd to come from P but like it says in the subject, the beats are incredible!!! I cant get enough of it. My favorite song is ""Show you how to hustle"" the beat is TOO sick. Keep it up!"
5,And Pharrell Williams became a genius...,"I can't stop thinking Pharrell as the new music genius of our time, like Prince was (and maybe still is) in the 80's.It's not surprising to hear some refreshing tunes from a man like Pharrell but, once again, he throws a bomb, and gives a lesson to a lot of crappy rnb/hip/hop producers, famous or not...I think this man took time to learn and practice music, he did not improvise himself a producer...he can play instruments and certainly has a plethoric soul/funk/rock background.Apart 1 or 2 weak tracks, the album is so homogenic, so fresh and melodic that it's hard to drop the headphones...ALBUM OF 2006 without a doubt..."
3,Forgettable...,"This album is nothing new and mostly forgettable. Pharrell should stick to producing and skateboarding and working on his clothing label, which are assuredly more promising and eventful!"
1,stick to producing,"Some people should not go solo, he is one. A few songs are just ok, but the REST is PAIN! to my ears...AKA PAIN STAIN.. he is out of his mind for this junk. I do know why i bught this CD. I am always willing to give a person a chance, but this is worst the the last project he did a few years back. Even some if the other artist stuff he produce is getting tired. Hope he saved up his money, cause guess what his time is up."
1,P Shoulda Kept His Mouth Closed,"Awful! Just awful! This shoulda been released as just an instrumental album, and even then it'd be pretty bad. I liked the NERD stuff, but this thing is a waste of all that aluminum . . . ."
1,Garbage,This album is terrible from start to finish. their literally is not a single good song on this CD. The only alright song on this CD is Number 1 but that's only because of Kanye's presence. Pharrel has proved with this album that he has nothing to say and has an annoying singing voice. This album deserves just 1 star.
2,what in the world...,THIS WAS A WASTE OF MONEY AND I AM TAKING IT BACK TO TARGET...I LET IT PLAY WHILE I DID SOMETHING ELSE..DID NOT LIKE IT...GO BACK TO NERD LIKE ALBUMS PHARRELL
4,A good buy,"I am a huge fan of Pharell's work and this is definately a good buy. There are a few tracks that I skip over because it gets boring after the beat drops... But there are a handful of golden tracks on his album that makes it all worth while. I especially like ""Our Father"", his testimony about his personal relationship with God. Hot tracks throughout, Pharell has definately done it again."
3,"This is a good album, ""In His Mind""?","Sorry Pharell for being honest. Consistency is an issue with Pharell and Chad when it comes to their beats. I've always been a fan because they don't really sample on their songs and that's original. But for such talented producers to put out an entire album with only a few tight beats is beyond my understanding. I can't even say I was expecting anything significant lyrically, like on P.Diddy's first album which I love. Suprisingly the lyrical content was not that bad until it became a constant love song. All in all, I wanted great Neptunes beats and didn't get them. Traded the album in the day after I bought it and got $3.50 for it. That tells you something."
3,"Super Producer, Average Rapper","No doubt one of the best producers in the game next to lil jon, dj paul, juicy j and david banner. But he is an average rapper with average lyrics. had some good guest spots Jay-z, and Snoop Dogg, but just don't like gwen stafani a wanna be black woman should just be left off. get it if you like great beats but not for people who wanna great lyrics."
4,Where is the real????,"I love me up some pharrell back whe he was with NERD and him and chad was makin beats as the Neptunes. This man is cold. the only thinkg i did not like was the way he was no spittin the real stuff that he usally do with NERD. Sure a woman can be beautiful, or rapping about drugs is cool now.. but Pharrell where is the stuff that i know and love when u use to have me thinking weeks later about what u said???? I guess this is the real him all by himself, but i must say that the wait for the CD was worth it..."
4,Pharrell's In My Mind was worth the wait.,"After waiting nearly a year,Pharrell's solo CD finally arrives.The music and lyrics are both inovative.This CD could have easily been put out in the year 2012 and people would still love it.As a producer myself, I appreciate the freshness of the drums and the music. My only disappointment was there is no lyric sheet!"
4,This album grows on you after a while.....,"At first glance, this joint comes off as Michael and Prince kareoke. But with further review, this joint is pretty decent. The best cut is ""I really like you girl"", which should be the next single with MJ on the remix. It sounds like Wham's ""Everything she wants"" but it's actually a slighty screwed version of Chaka Khan's ""I feel for you"". Track 7 is another standout with Snoop,Charlie Wilson and Morris Day. The best description of this album is futuristic beats with a retro 80's r & b feel to it."
1,Not focused on the music,"Pharrel used to be a great producer back with the neptunes. I mean they really made great beats in the late 90s and early 00s.But it seems that since Pharrel has become some type of fashion icon, he's not about the music anymore. This is really bland, overproduced hip hop. He's all about his image now, this whole fashion thing him and kanye have going is just diluting the minds of the youth. I mean he performs with a backpack on...how corny is that?I guess he needs to keep making albums so his BBC line sells...oh well."
5,Great,"I never fully appreciated the intellect of Forrest until I finished this book. It peels away the myths about the man, and tells about what he was really like. I loved it, and often flip around in it from time to time. A must for Civil War buffs!"
4,Lack of Darryl,Over all the book was very good. I was disappointed in the lack of Darryl. I had assumed that he was going to be one of the main characters in the later books. I was interested to see what was going to happen to him. I hope he makes a bigger appearance in A Wizards War.
4,The Wizard's Holiday: The Seventh Book in the Young Wizards Series,Another entertaining book in the series. Good fun with some real life problems. Book eight is enjoyable too.
2,The worst Sakura Taisen addition,Sakura Taisen-Ecole De Paris is a fragments and lacking anime addition to the Sakura Taisen series. The show starts off by introducing the main character but then proceeds to assume that the viewer is already aware of the back ground or the characters. I am aware that the show is based on a game in Japan but as a free standing show it lacks any flow to it. I bought this DVD since I have all of the previous Sakura Taisen anime DVDs but if I were a new viewer I would skip this one.
1,Laughable,"I tend to judge the value of a book on accents by listening to an example of the way I, as an Australian, supposedly speak. From this I tend to gauge the accuracy of the other accents.Robert Blumenfeld has obviously NEVER heard an Australian speak. There may be, in some remote corner of the country, someone who speaks as he describes - a cross between South African and New Zealander- but I have never encounterd them. On this basis, I would avoid this work like the plague for fear of being laughed off the stage, or screen - or out of the audition room"
1,Lopsided,"This book is great, if you want to learn a British accent -- Blumenfeld dedicates more than eight minutes on the CD to it. Unfortunately for me, I picked it up for Asian accents. Blumenfeld wrote a large paragraph, describing how 'The King & I' demonstrated a lousy Thai accent. Who cares? He then dedicated all of 17 seconds to Thailand on the CD. Many other 'chapters,' are similar. A complete waste of my time and money."
5,Foreign Dialects,"Absolutely wonderful book. Used the British dialect part, and it was terrific. Am now more confident about the dialect. Also includes lesser used dialects, (Yiddish, Russian, Bermuda twist on British dialect, etc.)."
2,Not Impressed,"Unfortunatley, most of the book is simply a description of each langauge and its origins. Towards the end of these descriptions are a pitiful few examples of how to pronounce each accent. I had to return this book for it was did not have enough examples to perfect any one accent."
2,Just See an Dialect Coach,"I tried to learn an accent the cheap way by buying this book, but realized the only way to learn accents or dialects effectively is to see a dialect coach."
2,Comedy,"This book should be in the comedy section, while a lot of work have gone into research and the information is useful - the actual accents are terrible!Americans might think it's okay but I've sat around the table with Australian & English friends and all we can do is laugh.Please don't take one of these accents overseas and think you'll be taken seriously!!"
3,Decent Sparring Guide,"I enjoyed this DVD. It contains some fundamental martial arts sparring concepts that can be used by beginners, but which can also be used for more advanced practitioners wishing to really work basic techniques in sparring. I definitely recommend this for martial artists who are just beginning to spar."
4,Kumite,"Not a bad DVD, very informative and explained very well in detail..I actually tried a couple moves from the DVD and was impressed on how the competitor didn't see the punch coming.. The Kumite at the end of the DVD was okay, they could have picked it up a bit more. The key to making any technique in this DVD to work is to practice... :)"
4,"Good Interpretations, but what about the sound???","Just that!! Verdi and Bruckner are presented very well by Karajan, however, the sound...uneven, distorted (very beginning of the Te Deum...) I've heard better!"
4,Great movie,Everyone in the startup business needs to watch this one. It does a great job of presenting the personalities of all the big players.
3,The green was not exactly what we thought it would look like.,This seat is not as deep of green that we were looking for. It is more a minty looking green.
3,Silent On One Major Issue,"While the information presented is informative and interesting, Saxe mentions nothing about the destruction of Arlinton's great old downtown area. ""Forces"" in the city, at some point, determined to demolish most of the classic old downtown, and ruin it with a boxy library building, completely erasing a great deal of the town's history. The results proved to be so unpopular that the perpetrators went into hiding, and there's no clear record as to who was responsible. Saxe should have investigated and reported upon this, because it is a significant travesty in the history of Arlington."
3,Not a keeper,"This is the story of reunion between Angie and Sam of forgotten love. When Angie meet Sam for their divorce, she never expected Sam to have another woman in his life and 2 kids in tow, Lucy and Daisy. The delightul characters of 2 very adorable girls smacked me right on head. I love Angie for her strong characters, but much is left to be desired with the book. The author did not explain how Lucy and Daisy come into the custody of Sam.This book is not a keeper. I prefer I Do, I Do, I Do much better."
3,Very good for large bathrooms and styles tend to be more traditional,"This book doesn't cater for smaller bathrooms. The pictures shown here are mostly for master bathrooms and doesn't give much focus to guests bathrooms. I find that the styles shown here are very traditional and classic in design. Not much coverage on more modern approaches for bathrooms. Very little coverage for Asian type of bathrooms, you'll find lots of emphasis on the bathtubs instead of shower cubicles."
2,Non-uniform,"I don't know if it was a fluke or if their quality control is poor but the material was much thicker on one pad than the other. The ""thin"" one was really too thin though it still served as a skin protector. It also fit more loosely because it was thin. Disappointed!"
2,How the hell did this make the MLA 100?,"This is not a good book. It is incoherent. It is poorly written. It is silly, pretentious, and, at times, melodramatic. How can this be one of the hundred best novels of the 20th century? Bryce Courtenay's The Power of One is ten times the book that this is. The only positive thing I can say about Wide Sargasso Sea is that it doesn't take very long to read."
2,"TO SMALL FOR THE 17"" DELL INSPIRON 1721","This was a attractive, reasonably priced, well constructed laptop sleeve but too small for my 17"" Dell Inspiron 1721 laptop. I was under the impression that if it said 17"" it should fit my 17"" laptop. Not so, what a boomer!"
4,"Doesn't fit 17"" Gateway P-7811 laptop","I admit the construction is good on this sleeve. Just be warned it doesn't fit all 17"" laptops. I have the 17"" Gateway P-7811 FX laptop. It fits into the sleeve, but it cannot be zipped shut with or without the battery. I ended up selling it for $20 to somebody that had a smaller laptop (deployed and too much trouble to mail it back). Still looking for a large sleeve that will completely seal up my Gateway."
3,"O.k. quality, but too small for Gateway P-7805u Notebook","I have a FX series Gateway laptop. Model P-7805u. This laptop sleeve is too small with or without the battery pack (which sticks out the back of the laptop)I actually ordered this particular bag after reading some of the reviews that said it works for the FX series! But maybe the P-7805u is bigger than some of the other FX series?Planning on ordering the CVR217, Targus 17"" Laptop Slip Case which is bigger."
4,Perfect Fit for HP G72 Laptop,"This fits the HP G72 17"" laptop perfectly. The laptop fits snug in the sleeve with enough room at the top to zip without hitting the corners of the laptop. It's easy to carry but I would have liked it better if it had shoulder straps. An outer pocket for laptop accessories would have made this a 5 star purchase. There does seem to be enough room to fit a light folder or pad of paper on the inside & possibly a pen. After researching similar items online, this was definitely worth the price."
3,Enjoyable,"Edmund Purdom and Ann Blyth appeared together once before in The Student Prince - a beautiful love story between a Prince and a bar-maid - with great singing by Ann and the dubbed voice of Mario Lanza; this time out, although not as enchanting a love story, at least this one has a happy ending! Good supporting cast with David Niven as the properly evil villain, and George Sanders as a strangely un-absorbed King Charles 11. Lots of action and sword-play to keep us entertained."
2,Tornado Maker,A really interesting toy. Very hard to always make a tornado without adjusting. Doesn't really do much unless it is on the fastest setting. Four year old for whom it was bought thinks it is super but gets a bit fustrated when it doesn't make the funnel and a grownup has to mess with it to get it to work.
2,"Did not work, asked for replacement","It was my son's 10th birthday this August and I did read the reviews before purchasing, so I guess I get what a deserve..... My son wanted this along with a Dr. Who Sonic Screwdriver - which was great!.. These were the only two things that he asked for and this low speed blender that made noise did not work.... Thank goodness I purchased him a few other things: the Dalek Clock - LOVED IT and the DK book about scientist - great...... I returned item and asked for replacement, still waiting for replacement because my son really wanted item.... MY ADVISE - Do Not Waste Your Money!!!! If you are anything like me and your child really wants it, you will probauly purchase it too and be as disappointed as we were, I warned you...... UPDATE: Received the replacement and it works... My son just loves it... However, the dial seems very flimzy, I do not know how long it will last. Makes a nice funnel but the novelty will wear off fast....."
1,"Get the ""Color Changing Vortex"" instead!!","Did not work out of the box. Sound effects but no spin action. Amazon replaced quickly but the 2nd one leaked badly. Has to be on F4 or F5 to make a funnel. Luckily we had also purchased the ""Color Changing Vortex"" also from Amazon so Christmas wasn't a complete disaster for our tornado loving son. We are just keeping the Slinky Tornado but it has to be used over a towel or sink. Probably won't last long with the insides wet all of the time."
1,waste of money,This was a christmas present and didn't work right out of the box. It is such poor quality that the motor wouldn't even turn the prop against the resistance of the gasket let alone water. Don't waste your money. This machine was never meant to work. The motor is way too small.
2,Not something that lasts long,"I bot this for my son's birthday in November and by Christmas it leaked all over, Don't know what happened. Eventually threw it away. Not very durable."
1,Piece of junk!!!!,"The only reason i gave it one star is because there isn't a choice for zero.....Total piece of junk that literally broke Christmas morning, FIRST USE!!!!! Merry Christmas, Johnny!"
3,Already broken but so much fun,Unfortunately 1 month after Christmas and the toy is broken. Hope they will replace as my son loves this toy. He made lots of tornadoes in one month.
1,Junk,"This is all my son really wanted for X-mas,did not work out of the box X-mas morning,bought him another one and it also did not work out of the box.Both had noise but now tornado.I'm frustated and worst of all my 5 year old is sad,manufacturer needs to think of the kids they are letting down before selling a defective product line."
1,I'll try it one more time.,"Although I had read some negative things about this entire toy line not working very well, I bought it anyway.When we tried to use it on Christmas day, it wouldn't work. What a disappointment for Christmas morning. But, since my Grandson really wants to see the tornado, I asked Amazon to replace it. I have my fingers crossed."
3,Just like the other Sims games.,"You play this game just like the other Sims games. You control the people that you choose to create in your family. You create your pets, but you can't control them. I bought the game thinking that I would be able to play the game as a dog or a cat, but then I discovered that I could only play as people.The game is just as entertaining as the other Sims games. The main difference is that you not only have goals for your people, but for pets too (lean tricks, potty training, etc.)."
3,"If You Like Taking Care Of Pets, Then Buy This!","This Is The Only Sims Game I Have And I Dont Think I'll Buy The Others Now. I've Always Heard Good Things About The Sims But I Just Dont Get It. Games Should Be Hard In a Good Way, This One Is Just Plain Difficult. Its Impossible To Keep Your Poor Person Happy And In Good Health. And Your Poor Dogs And Cats End Up Running Away Because They Were Sad And Negleted. :( Its Hard To Get A Job And Make Friends. And If You Dont Hire A Maid And Gardner You Whole House And Yard Goes To Pot! It Is Such A VERY Busy And Dare I Say, VERY Stressful Game. There Is No Way To Keep Up With Everything. Its A Challenge For Sure. It Is Fun I Guess. Designing Your House And All. But Your Person Gets Tired And Hungry To Fast And The Days Goes By Far To Fast. I Just Dont Like It That Much Overall. I Recomend Animal Crossing And Harvest Moon Over This By Far."
3,Im stuck in a loop,"Same as the sims2 but you dont control the pets freewill. Thats what the petsSIMS is for. YOu just keep a lookout for the floating bubble at the top of the screen to see if your pet wants something. 'fufu wants a bellyrub."" etcAnywho, Their is no dachshund. Thats what I went to look for right away.Well, dachshunds are a handful in reallife, thats probably why they werent included. =SPlus my dog had a baby and it was a 'devil dog.' It was all red with pink bone markings on it..*shudders*Right now Im annoyed b/c its in a loop that I want a stray to join the family and nothing has happened. *yes I removed the 'no stray sign*"
4,Pleased,"We were very pleased about the perchase. The delivery time was sooner than expected, and the product was as promised. We wish all individuals/companies would conduct bussiness in this manner."
4,pretty fun,its a fun game reminds me of the good old days when it first came out but now i mostly play it when i get bored lol
4,Sims Pets for Gamecube,"If you're going to get a Sims game for gamecube, get this one! Was the most fun out of all the ones available for the gamecube."
2,Flawed CD,"The CD was new and most of the game play worked, but I wasn't able to add any wall coverings or the game would freeze, I hope others don't have the same issue."
1,Take it BACK!!!,I had this game for one night.. bought it at a second hand game shop. The price was right.. yet.. I came to find out.. it is only for one player. I have a big family.. and we all like to play. This is only for one player. What a rip off! If I were you.. I'd stick with the Sims 2 game. Even the first Sims game for Gamecube. I found this game very very boring!
2,Alien Language,"This game is ok, to a degree. If you like these kinda games i understand. but...i personallly like games that i can UNDERSTAND. BLLAGUSHAPU....WHAT?!?!?!!?!?!?2 stars...tops"
4,Not a good buy... [kids review],"First of all, the cheats are the crappiest things EVER! I'm only 11 but when I'm buying a game, I know what I'm looking for! The sims is always one of my top choices but the one for the gamecube should NOT be bought! It's so dumb, the only thing you can do is spend money! Don't you want those instant millionaire sims sometimes?? Well, I do. When I have searched up the cheats, they don't work! I have had everyone in my family try them, and I have tried them! DO NOT GET THIS GAME! It's fun to some extent, but you know, how you like to get that certain toy, but you don't have enough money. Just really, don't get this one! Get the others.4 stars MAX!!!!!!!!"
4,Its a awsome game!,"I thought it was hard at first, but after deleting my old game and trying it again, it was so much fun! When you go to the park, you can buy awsome stuff for you and your pet(s), meet new people and become friends, and more! But heres a tip: When you first start the game, only get One or two pets because when I first started, I got five pets and it was a disaster! Now I play for hours, and I just can't stop playing! I would recomend it for anyone who loves animals or just anybody who loves spending hours playing video games! It's a must have game!"
3,IT FREEZES UP,"HAD IT ONLY A FEW WEEKS, AND IT FREEZES UP ALREADY. NO, IT IS NOT THE GAMECUBE BECAUSE THEY PLAY OTHER GAMES ON IT AS WELL. I DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL, AND MY 7 YR OLD IS BEGINNING TO BECOME DISPLEASED WITH IT AS WELL BECAUSE OF IT FREEZING UP. THUMBS DOWN ON SIMS 2 PETS.:("
2,A Let Down,"I loved the original SIMS. I had hoped that SIMS 2 Pets would be only an improvement. It was in that the graphics were better and the pets are wonderful; however, the building options were more limited and unlike SIMS 2 there wasn't a story mode, which I looked forward to playing."
4,Good Moisture,Usually wake up in the morning in radiant skin. Like it with no fragrance. The only downside is it is a bit stingy to put on after washing face with facial wash.
3,"Really Nice Production, but Thats About It!","I'm about through with Bigg Snoop. I keep telling myself I'm going to quit buying this man's music after the way he did the 213 album (which was excellent and long overdue), but I keep going back. The highlight on the album is ""Real Soon"" for obvious reasons (Snoop, Nate, Kurupt & Daz). Couple nice beats from Battlecat & Soopafly. Without production from Daz or Dre (yeah, right), DPGC tracks feel incomplete. The rest of the album is RnB with a couple rap tracks from Tiffany Foxx which is nothing like any of the Welcome to tha Chuuch mixtapes. So, I'll bump it, but it's far from a classic. I like Doggy Style All-Stars better. Hey Snoop, Where the hell is LaToiya Williams?"
5,PREACH!,"THIS ALBUM IS BANGIN FROM BEGINNING TO END. BIG SNOOP DOGG HAS PROVIDE US WITH A ALBUM FULL OF SOUL, AND GANGSTA MUSIC. I LOVE THIS CD, AND WILL BANG IT THROUGH THE NEW YEAR. BIG UPS TO SNOOP DOGG, AND THE WHOLE DPG FAMILY. WESTCOAST THE BEST COAST"
5,Perfect Fit,Lighter was a perfect fit - realized it was the same brand found at many local auto parts shops and could have just picked one up there since price was actually same as local places.
2,sorta working,"I don't mind that it doesn't look exactly like the advertised pic.It does fit into the socket of the car I chose before buying this product.That's a plus.The minus: it can't be called ""pop out"" because it would not stay in.I tried it on the car, I had to push it in and held it there for a whileto light my cigarette.My decision: I will keep this and get used to it.It's now called ""56442-push-and-hold-cigarette-lighter"".I don't want to return because they might ask me to buy a new carto use this product the way it's supposed to be used. :-)"
2,Crapped out after just a few months.,"It did work when I got it, and it did work for three, maybe four months after I got it. Then, one day, it not only quit working, but the heating element started coming uncoiled and caused a blown fuse.I wouldn't have thought that a replacement cigarette lighter for a car would be a science akin to building a space shuttle, as there is no real rocket science involved. However, it might be worth your while to spend a few extra bucks and go to your OEM for a replacement if you need one."
1,Doesn't Fit,This does not fit my BMW 135I Convertible. Very disappointing. Now I will need to buy a BMW lighter that probably costs way too much :(
1,Does'nt even fit!!!,This lighter was so big it got stuck when we tried to put it in and now it wont come out!
4,Good value at a fraction of car dealer's price,I can't believe I used to get replacements at a car dealership. This lighter works great & at such a low price.
1,doesn't work,"It is too small in diameter to work in my car, a 2005 Saturn ION, door.The price is great, delivery time very good but it isn't worth the time andmoney to return it for a refund."
5,Beautiful,"Kaori Yuki's artwork for Angel Sanctuary is just beautiful in a realistic, haunting sort of way. Angel Sanctuary is a wonderful manga that every manga and anime fan should read!"
3,Small Frie-YES!,"I received the item as promised, but the comedians were not funny except Small Frie! She was hilarious! I would buy any comedy that she is a part of."
2,Not All That!!!,"I ordered this because I was looking for comedy I could enjoy with my whole family and based on the reviews already posted I thought this might be a good DVD to try. I have to say, outside of Lester Berry who was somewhat funny the rest was not really funny. I certainly wasn't rolling on the floor and won't rush to watch again and again. If you are looking for clean comedy that will have you laughing out loud and rolling on the floor a much better choice is Steve Harvey's ""Don't trip he aint through with me yet"". This just wasn't all that!!"
5,Very Funny,"This DVD was very funny. All of the comedians were funny. I watched this DVD one time with my mother and another time with my aunt and cousins. I was able to laugh at the same jokes all though I had already seen the DVD. That is how I can tell that a DVD is funny, when I can laugh all over again."
4,MC Stole the Show,All of the comedians were funny (particularly AJ Jamaal) but the whole DVD could have been dedicated to the MC who was absolutely hysterical!
5,Best CD of the year,If you dont have this cd you are not a true reggae lover....Jah Bless you all...
5,Album is HOT,I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. I'm not even that big on the whole reggae scene but when I heard this I knew it was an instant banger PICK IT UP you won't regret it ONE
3,Typical one good song CD...,"After listening to one of his songs on myspace, I decided to order this cd for my bf's birthday. Since he had also heard the one song on myspace, he was excited to hear the rest of the album, but was disappointed with most of the songs. It has a couple good songs, but the rest are sort of bland and sounded the same."
1,Makes good reggae sound even better,"This is one of those albums that makes you realize what the difference between good and bad music is. In this case we're talking about reggae music which in my opinion has some of the best sounding music of all genres. Collie Buddz tries, but just plain fails. For any fan of reggae I can't and won't recommend this cd."
2,"like some songs, unoriginal sound","There are some songs on this album that I really enjoy and would be could for the club. ""Blind to You"" ""Let me Know"" ""Mamacita"" and ""What a Feeling."" However, he sounds exactly like Wayne Wonder from six years ago from his album No Holding Back. I didn't know if Collie Buddz was an individual singer or a group, so I actually thought it was a group of Wayne Wonder's until I looked on his website to find out it was a guy named Colin Harper. Even some of the beats sound exactly like Wayne Wonder beats. I would estimate that I thought it was Wayne Wonder on more than half the songs before I looked. Some pretty good songs unfortunately I thought it was a huge rip off Wayne Wonder and I don't know if thats supposed to be good or bad?!?!"
3,Not very good,"A couple of the songs are pretty good but most are not. Don't be fooled by the sound bites like I was and buy the whole album. ""Tommorows another day"", ""Blind to You"", ""Come Around"", ""Sensimilla"" and ""Let Me Know"" are all pretty decent but certainly not epic. The rest of the songs are not very good and a couple are really terrible. More than anything though, you have to admire the courage of the guy's choosen name, lyrical content and talent. The guy's got guts, and that noone can argue. However courage does not an excellent song make. He would do better to focus his talents and his all too rare courage to stick to true roots style reggae songs like the Dr. Bird style riddim found in his hit song ""Tommorrows Another Day"". If he does that he will go from average to amazing in a very short ammount of time."
4,The Three Stooges - Hapless Half-Wits,"These are Great Timeless Slapstick Comedy Shorts from the 1940s and well worth the 14 dollars for the Colorized versions. The titles are---Beer Barrel Polecats (1945) (with Curly)I'll Never Heil Again (1941) (with Curly)Dopey Dicks (1949) (with Shemp)Brideless Groom (1947) (with Shemp)These are a first for me to see the Shemp verions Colorized and they all look better being colorized. I know some extremists will be upset about the colorization, but they can view them in Black & white if they choose to.I really liked them all except for ""I'll Never Heil Again"" which I thought was a little boring. I'd like it if Columbia Pictures would colorize some more of these shorts in the future."
3,Nice Colorization,"True...At $5 Bucks A Short It Creates A Rent & Rip Mentality But I Like The Colorized Shorts.........However Sony Has Now Done The Right Thing By Releasing: The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. I. 19 Shorts In Original Release Order. 1934-1936 That Works Out To $1:05 Per. Short!.....So Quit Whining, You Can Take It Or Leave It.......As For Me, Im Waiting For Vol. II. & All Future Colorized Versions!"
1,hapless halfwits indeed,"colorizing the stooges borders on like the perverse. i have not bought one of these ""collections"" in quite some time and really why would any true stooge fan waste his/her money on something he/she already has AND is colorized? its as if the knuckle heads in charge of the stooge shorts hold us in contempt. give them less, charge them more, edit with a hacksaw and then DEmaster the whole mess. my recomendation is to boycott this shameful nonsense. hapless and halfwited indeed."
1,"Please, DO NOT BUY THIS !!",I can get past the colorization but I will never get past the fact that there are only 4 shorts on the DVD and theY're the same old re-cycled ones. There are dozens of episodes sitting in the vaults waiting to see the light of day and we're still getting 'Brideless Groom'. Please do not spend your money on this rip-off. Send a message to SONY...WAKE UP SONY !!!!!!
1,boycott these piece-mealed offerings,"I don't know who's in charge of the stooge shorts but it is a scandal what they're doing, piece-mealing them out a few at a time and not even showing the whole show in its entirety. Why there is not a comprehensive, unedited, and remastered box set of these legends is beyond me. Be like me and boycott until they do it right. I actually like the coloring as an option, if it is able to be turned on or off."
2,yawn,"I don't mind the colorization because it looks great BUT how many versions of ""Brideless Groom"" do we need both in color or b&w? which leaves us with three shorts that haven't been colored yet,of curse which leaves us with only two shorts to not have released on dvd before,since two of these shorts have been released, so you're paying for two shorts...I like the idea of some shemp shorts but for pete's sake release some of his shorts that haven't seen the light of day on dvd not ""Brideless Groom"" which has been released over a thousand times since it's public domain (yes even in color a few times)also when will we see some shorts with larry moe and JOE in them ,it's better than getting the same stuff over and over again since there isn't one dvd that has anything to do with Joe..............."
1,Does not work properly,I purchased this brand and model of camera. It worked marginally well for a couple months and then wouldn't go off at all even if you walked right in front of it. I contacted Moultrie and they said it probably needed to be reprogrammed. I paid the shipping and sent it to them. When it came back it worked really well - like it should. That lasted for about a month and then it was back to the way it was before. You could walk directly in front of it and it would not go off. I didn't feel I needed to be sending it in every other month to get reprogrammed. I contacted Moultrie Customer Service again through their web site and told them of the problem. I received NO response what so ever from Moultrie. I believe there is something wrong with these cameras or some kind of bug in the electronics portion to begin with because why should then need to be reprogrammed all the time in order to work.My recommendation - if you want a camera that works properly buy a different brand.
1,Do not purchase,"Recieved product not working. Tried many, many, times to obtain return authorization. When somebody finally answered I was hung up on. I will never purchase from this company again."
4,The Dino Rangers last DVD,"I would have given this a five star but the Disney company hasn't completed a Power Ranger Series EVER! I buy all the time collections of entire series on older TV shows than the Power Rangers, but they only produce a limited bunch of episodes. SPD 3/4, Dino Thunder 3/4, Mystic Force 2/4 (I think), Jungle Fury 1/4 (again I think, they only did two DVDs on this series). And they haven't even done any DVDs of the older series of Power Rangers; MMPR, Turbo, Zeo, Space, Lost Galaxy. Yeah they did some Lightspeed Rescue and Wild Force on VHS but they haven't brought those the DVDs. And until they do I won't be happy with purchasing the Power Rangers episodes."
4,Entertaining,This is Classic Power Ranger stuff-which is exactly what you want for your children-something with a familiar format which they love.
3,informative but stifling,"This book is a good introduction to twentieth century trends in literary criticism -- the New Critics, structuralism, and post-structuralism. It's informative and scientific in its approach and has a good bibliography, but it's written in a stifling academic jargon which could have been dispensed with. Based on its informativeness, I'd have given it four or five stars; based on its style, one or zero stars. (O George Orwell, where are you when we need you?)"
3,Not the original song,this title song is a remix/rap song not the original song from 1973 and of course you dont know that till you open it up.
4,Pure power!,"This is a very rare DVD ,it was right before Chuck Shuldiner past away so it is one of the few dvd's out there of Death, The sound is raw and heavy ,you hear everything fine a must have for the fans of DEATH."
1,garbage,"Yes, the girls are pretty, but the acting, plot, and holes in the plot are laughable and pathetic. James Remar looks embarassed, and Baldwin looks stoned. Why did they even waste the film? Makes Ed Wood look like Orson Welles."
1,Words are Inadequate,"Since I never purchased this item, nor seen the film, I am unable to give this particular a higher rating. It may or may not deserve more stars than I have alloted to it but at this time I feel a rating of one star is sufficient."
1,Joke,This product is a joke. Does not work!!! I totally trashed it after trying everything to get it to work. Please don't buy it.
3,Does not always read the cards,"Mostly it works ok, and I really like the form factor.But many times it will not read the card. This could be an issue of power, but I DO have the power supply plugged in. (I suppose it could also be the computer, but I do not have the same problem with a portable reader plugged into another port on the computer)"
2,Died a quiet death,"I bought one of these to help me control the chaos of Firewire and USB wires on my desktop. I have had it about 4 months. It died. I am unable to return it to iogear since I no longer have the original packaging or receipt.My home office started to smell like burning electronics. The unit had overheated. Luckily it did not take anything that was plugged in to it with it. I think I will not be buying an off-brand again to save a few pennies.While it worked, it worked great (thus 2 stars vs 1)."
1,"Good design, poor quality","I really liked the design of this unit but it failed completely after about 90 days...just stopped working. Other types and brands of hubs connected to my iMac work just fine so I've no idea what happened to this one. Wish I could recommend it as I had high hopes, but I'd go with something else."
1,not satisfied,the firewire hub does not work at all but the usb do now i have to find a new way t connect firewire to a non firewire pc
1,Firewire ports are unpowered,Don't bother with this hub; the firewire ports are unpowered. Your iPod will drain its battery power; your firewire hard drive will not work unless it has its own AC power source.
3,"Good combo hub, cheap stand","This hub works well on my iMac, no problems at all. I especially like the 2 available ports (1 firewire, 1 USB) on the front for easy access to plug in temporary devices such as a USB memory stick, firewire video camera, etc. As noted, you don't really get 3 firewire ports, since one of them is needed to connect the hub to your computer leaving only 2 firewire ports left on the hub. Definitely misleading advertising. My biggest complaint is the cheap soft rubber stand that this hub just sits in. It is very unstable and loose fitting, and the hub pops out of the stand very easily if knocked over. Hence the 3 star rating. Otherwise, it a nice hub for the money."
1,Not for iSight or iPod users,"In it's capacity as a USB hub the GUH420 appears to work as advertised and has 4 useable USB ports. In it's capacity as a firewire hub, it lacks bus power and only has 2 usable ports for consumer devices. The absence of bus power means the iSight does not work at all when connected through the hub and an iPod works until it's battery runs flat."
2,Disappointed,"I've been looking for a Firewire/USB combo hub to connect to my Mac Mini in our entertainment center, something to reduce the clutter. I needed a powered hub for some of my devices that I hook up to the Mini that require a powered hub. As soon as I got the IOGEAR 4-Port USB 2.0 and 3-Port FireWire Universal Hub (GUH420) I placed it in the entertainment center. I ran the power cable to the hub, but the adapter wouldn't fit, the adapter came with the hub and it doen't; no matter how hard I push, the adapter plug will not fit into the power port on the hub. There is a weird quirk with the FireWire port, when I plug my mac Mini into it 3 of the USB indicator lights light up. It looks really nice in my entertainment center. I can't believe this from Iogear, I've always been happy with thier products. This one is a disappointment."
2,Not AS Good As I Hope.,"I was hoping to gain (3) three Firewire ports,but to do so you have to use (1) of the (3) Firewire ports to use the other (2) two Firewire ports. But I made do,but if you need USB ports it it works for that. David L Sloan Jr."
5,Smooth Like Butta,"Reminisence of Al Jarreau & Maxwell's Vibe on Urban Hang Suite. Add this to your collection of ""Neo-Soul."" This gets away from the run of the mill ""lick U up & down"" lyrics that are getting a little blase'. This CD has real music (not just samples) and lyrics that actually say something. The entire CD is good, from start to finish. It is Jazzy, smooth, sensual...need I say more? Can't say what my favorites are because they are all good. Definitely worth getting!!!!!!"
5,Kem is a great cd!,"EXCELLENT CD, very smooth relaxing music, has a jazz/rythm and blues feel. Reminds me of Al Jarreau with a soulful feel, he handles the lyrics defly one of the few cd's that I have in which I like ALL THE SONGS which is pretty good. ""Say"" is my favorite but they are all nice, a good departure from the usual radio stuff and a unique style and good blend of music that he is able to bring together very well, more r&b music like this PLEASE! It would be great if motown gave him more promotion because this guy can sing. Highly recommended!"
5,The Kemistry,"This cd is a must have. I became familiar with Kem in the summer of 2002. I heard his cd Kemistry on a radio station in Detroit. His sound is very much like Al Jarreau.This brother from the Motor City is truely awsome. From the first song to the last song this cd will not let you down. Now his cd is being released on Motown Records. I had the pleasure of going to his cd release concert in Detroit on February 25, 2003.Not only does his cd sound good but he is excellent in concert.Many great artist have come out of the Motor City and now we have another rising star."
5,The Best CD In Long Time!!,"Kem sounds like a cross between Al Jarreau and Jonathan Butler taken to a level that they have never achieved. This young brother will blow you away with this no frills performance. It took me two listens to realize what was so unusual about this in-your-face performance. There are no background vocals, or stupid overdubbs, and you don't need or miss them. The third track on the CD entitled ""Say"" just blew me away. The rest of the CD will do the same. This is a ""must have"" and is coming from someone who listens mostly to jazz."
5,KEMISTRY,"THIS MAN IS THE BOMBS''' HE'S AN AL JARRAU SECOND SOUND WITH A HEART OF A MAN WHO HAS GONE THOUGH SOME THINGS. A BROTHER IN LOVE COULD BLOW A WOMANS MIND WITH ""MISS YOU, I MISS YOU, AND WHEN LOVE CALLS"" LIFE EXPERINCES PLAY A BIG ROLE IN THE HEART OF THIS ""ARTIST"" THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD FOR SURE. ROMANCES COMES TO MY MIND NOT ""SLEEP"" UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO CHILL ON IT IT JUST THAT SMOOTHING I CAN'T WAIT TO BE HIM IN PERSON. THIS BROTHER I WILL BE KEEPING MY EARS ON. MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS YOU KEM."
5,Outstanding,"Kem's lyrics are haunting. His melodies take you back. This is classic soul. Love songs. In love. Out of love. Hurting for love. Dying for love. Living for love. Kem handles all with enormous talent. His voice can break a word just at the right point and send you into the pain or ecstasy of love. There is not a weak track on this CD. For anyone looking for the next generation of Soul music, this is a must have."
4,Excellent talent!,"Every now and then a musician comes along with divine inspiration. Their words and melody capture you the first time and every time you hear their sound. I was completely awed by Kem! I thank my friends at Underground-soul for the tip on this one. This guy is great. He is soulful and by today's standards what one would call ""eclectic"". Kem fuses gospel with soul and an outpouring of emotions is demonstrated on this cd. A joy to listen to, I highly recommend this one. DJ COA"
4,Smooth debut,Enjoyed this purchase very much. Very easy listening music that helps you relax. He sometimes channels Al Jarreau a little too much for comfort but in general very good.
5,Smooth all the way through.,"I first heard Kem while listening to the Tom Joyner Morning Show. That afternoon after work I ran out to buy his CD and I've been hooked every since. Shortly after that I caught him performing live on BET and called everyone I knew to watch him. They are now also hooked. Kem's smooth flavor can mellow the most savage of souls and put you in the mood for just about anything. He's on my ""favorite musical brothas"" list right next to my man Maxwell. I take those two soulful brothas to work and I'm in a world of my own. Don't believe me, run out and buy it for yourself. Play track 3 or 10, you'll see."
4,"Finally, mature music!","Lately, I've been turned off by today's so called R&B; music. Tired of the same ol' explicitly sex filled ""slow jams"" being churned out by the young and immature as well the nasty R. Kelly type, I just gave up and resorted to listening to talk radio. I just happened to tune in to the radio and heard what I thought to be a new Al Jarreu song. I was surprised, I thought old Al was getting hip, so I turned it up. Smooth, mellow, lyrically inviting, I turned it up more. When the announcer stated that the artist name was Kem, I said who?This has to be one of the best CD's I've heard in a very long time, especially from a male artist. If you, like me, have been yearning for good mature music, get this! You will also thoroughly enjoy Kem's second CD 'Album II'. You will not be disappointed."
5,GREAT MALE SOUND TO COME AROUND IN A LONGTIME,"This is an awesome CD! KEM has a true, pure soulful sound that isn't heard often in todays music! A CD that you can start from the begining and listen to the very end! With a few replays here and there! If you have the pleasure to see this brother live, I suggest you do! He recently performed here in NY at the BEACON THEATER! He sounds just as good if not better live as he does on the CD! He is a true musician!"
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent CD! For once in a long time, I have purchased a CD in which I liked every song. Kem is going to have a long career!"
5,TOTALLY AWWWWWSOME!!,"This CD is absolutely terrific...jazzy...mellow...sexy!!My favorite is ""You are"" but I LOVE all of them! I think I'm burning a hole right through the CD!!GET THIS and your spirit will be warm!"
3,LOVE KEM MUSIC!!,GOD!!! HAS TRULY BLESS KEM..THANKS KEM YOUR SPIRIT SHINESTHRU AND THRU... YOUR WORDS AREFROM YOUR WONDERFUL HEART AND SOUL!!!Thank youSTARRLAR M. WATTSMAY GOD BLESS YOU ALWAYS
2,"Kem, No Thanks.","Just as Glenn Lewis made me feel nostalgic for Stevie Wonder, Kem got my mouth all set for some Al Jarreau-type soul. I was sorely disappointed on both counts. Kem is bland and boring. Each song is equally as sominex as the last. Sure, the man can carry a tune and his lyrics are nice, but his voice is void of character and adventure. That one song they play on the radio, ""Love Calls"" is OK, but the rest of the CD is very smooth-jazz blah."
1,Over the top,"How do I get my money back? I saw this advertised as Sade meets Steely Dan. Obviously the copywright guy didn't know about Sade's understated elegance. This CD is full of sappy lyrics about children are the flowers in the trees, etc. The singing is overdone with far too many of those vocal gymnastics that make Al Jarreau so unbearable. And the music might as well have come from a Casio. A terrible disappointment."
5,EXCELLENT,This product is an EXCELLENT choice for anyone who is interested. I suggest it for all to buy and see for themselves. It is definitely one to have.
5,Phenomenal,That's it...just buy it. It's perfect for that drive to the beach...or play it in traffic (or on the subway during rush hour) and have peace of mind.
5,He is the Man,This guy can really get to the heart of the soul. Great music for this day and age. Jusr put on your Bose and loose yourself
5,Quavo2k4,"This is tight I heard the song on the the radio and I liked it.I truely feel that you can not go wrong with this cd,being from Birmingham,Al I just like to ride to relaxing music and this is at the top of my list.This brother is very talented please dont sleep on him.This cd is a must"
5,Superb 1st Album,"Upon listening to the CD the first time, I was taken back to Al Jarreaus' earlier work. I enjoy listing to Kemistry from beginning to end. It's very calming to me. Al Jarreau is the man, but I can still hear your spark!"
5,"""Smooth"" with a capital ""oooooooth""","Real music, real lyrics, and an outstanding voice! If you liked the Al Jarreau of the 70's and early 80's (before he went commercial) you'll love this CD. Peace."
3,Okay but....,Love Calls is by far the best song. His style is repetitious in that many songs on the cd sound the same. He sounds very much like Al Jarreau throughout the cd which isn't necessarily a bad thing but not all that original.
3,Haven't made up my mind yet,Kem sounds more like Al Jarreau than Al Jarreau himself.Which is not bad. If you like Al Jarraeau.
4,"Not ""tippy"" at all","This pan doesn't tip at all, at least not on my flat surface stove. I have to give the handle a pretty hard knock before the pan will tip, even when empty. I'm glad I ordered this despite some of the warnings. Maybe it's just with certain kinds of burners where there are tipping problems.?"
4,For $15 it is Great.,It would be 5 stars if it came with a cover.It is not tippy unless you push down on the handle. It sits flat on my ceramic stove and looks great.
2,pot tips over,"I got this pot hoping that it'd be perfect for reheating small amounts of food and melting butter, but discovered on my first use that the handle is so heavy that the pot tips over backwards, even when it has some liquid in it. A total nuisance."
5,This is a great pan!,"I just purchased the Cuisinart 1-quart Pour Saucier, and I am really enjoying it. For Thanksgiving, I used the pan to make my honey glaze for my ham. Not only did I have no problem with the pan ""tipping"" while I was whisking the glaze, but the pan kept the glaze warm without burning it ... and it's a pretty sugar-laden glaze. I'm not quite sure why others have a problem with the pan tipping. I've used it at least a half dozen times in the few weeks I've owned it, and the pan has never tipped even once and even if I was stirring the contents of the pan without holding onto the handle. All in all, I would say that this pan is a great value for the price."
3,Will be getting the anodized version..,Don't have this one but will be getting the anodized one. I hope it does not tip (balance) as the reviews outlined. How could the testers at CuisinArt miss this?
4,Great for a quick sauce.,"Yes, it is a little ""tippy"" as others have said. But it has a great handle that never gets hot. And fortunately I have a special simmer burner (with a smaller opening) so it balances just fine. Make a great roux. Great value. I am happy with everything I have bought from this collection!"
5,"Good quality, good price",We already have another Cuisinart pot (a 1 1/2 quart) so this was a nice addition when we want to heat up 2 small portions at the same time. The handle design is beautiful. The handle does not get hot at all. We have an electric stove so there's some burner exposure even with the smaller burners - no big deal. It turns out that the lid to our 1 1/2 quart fits perfectly on top of this one - excellent!
2,Tippy Pot,"Heats great. looks great. Dangerous to use. Very poorly balanced. If not full it will tilt toward the handle. If it has just a bit of something in it, and it is not perfectly centered on gas stove grate it will tip and spill into the stove. Love the pour spout; it pours neatly. But it is unpredictable."
5,Cuisenart,Every kitchen should have one of these. We use this pan on a daily basis. It is great for toppings etc.
4,it's beautiful,"so shiny. It's so easy to clean. I've been using it to heat up campbell's soup, melt butter for cake recipes, cooked cream of wheat farina. Cleans very easily, a quick wipe with the sponge. After cooking farina, i wipe the pot clean right away so it doesn't have a chance to stick.the only down side, when it's empty, the handle makes it a little top heavy, it tilts over very easily unless there is fluid in it. if i had a toddler at home or a counter climbing cat i'd be cautious with it."
2,Okay,"Bought at the same time with several other kitchen gadgets, returned this item. Weird design maes it unstable. Stick with a more conventional pot for sauces."
4,Chef's Classic Stainless 1-Quart Pour Saucier,"Light for easy handling, cooks well, pours well. We are older and extra heavy pots are a problem. Works well if you want to do sauces,"
5,This is an excellent saucier for electric ranges,"I own two of these and I use them constantly. I am very happy with them. The heat is very even. You can use them as mixing bowls, then cook! The shape also makes it easier to fry in the bottom if you want to - I cooked myself a small steak in one this week.I think the complaints must be from people using gas ranges or who have tilted counters. These are clearly not meant for gas ranges. The sides are thin and as the shape would indicate they are a tippy if not on a flat surface."
2,"Very narrow base, wastes heat","I ordered this saucepan because it looked decent enough to serve my purpose. The package arrived on time, but contained a return sticker. So I am not sure if this product was bought from a store and then shipped to me. Product-wise, this is an okay saucepan. Like many reviewers mentioned, the handle is very heavy. So the pan has a tendency to tip over when empty. It did not seem a problem when I have liquid in the pan though. The pan also gets stained very easily in my opinion. The main problem I have with this pan is that the base is really really small. Because of this incredibly small surface, most of the heat from the stove is wasted and it takes longer for the liquid to boil. I would not recommend this pan. you can find something better for similar or slightly higher price."
2,Poor design,"In addition to the ""tippiness"" observed by the other reviewer, part of which is just a side effect of the otherwise-desirable saucier shape, the problem with this pan is that the aluminum disk is simply too small to make this a good pan for sauces, particularly if you are cooking with gas. No matter how small your flame, you get hot spots on the thin lower walls of the pan. Had I thought more about the design before purchasing I would definitely have bought the anodized aluminum version.It is an attractive pan and pours well, so my initial thought after discovering the poor cooking performance was to use it on the table for serving gravies and sauces. Unfortunately, the tippiness makes that kind of an unwise idea."
1,Saucier,"I should have heeded the reviews on this pan. I really don't like it. It is tippy, and there should be a pour spout on both sides. Would not recommend."
2,Tends to tip over,"I bought this saucier because of the price and am now sure I will have to replace it because it tends to tip over frequently. The handle is simply too heavy for the weight of the base and it is always tipping over, even when filled. I don't want to end up with scalding sauces all over me or make a huge mess on my stovetop, so I will be looking for a replacement soon."
4,Great pan! Great value.,"I use this one evryday and its an excellent value. The only problem is the pan tilting to the side of its handle, which is heavy, when its empty. But I have learnt to work around it. Great buy otherwise."
1,Pan Tips Over,"I'm returning mine today. I took it out of the box and put it on the countertop. It tipped over immediately. I have a gas stove, and there's no way I could cook with it. It really does tip over easily."
5,McCools is cool!,"This is one of the funniest films I have seen in ages. Liv Tyler is brilliant and its great to see she doesn't take her self too seriously - this is proof that she is one of the brightest young stars around. Matt Dillon is on top form again, following on from his great performances in There's Something About Mary and Wild Things, John Goodman maintains his excellent standards, and Steve Zahn also excels. Michael Douglas' cameo is alone worth paying for to see - especially with that quiff - and overall the endless one-liners and sharp soundtrack - plus the fact that the movie's ending is probably the funniest I've ever seen - make it an unmissable hit! Top marks!!!"
4,I loved it...It is a funny movie,"I admit I wasn't looking forward to watching this movie. I thought great another ""man"" movie. But, It was funny. And it wasn't Liv Tylor that made the movie funny... she did her job as being the ""easy freeloader"" whom works everything into being her way. But the men in this movie were great. They picked the right actors to make it work. I laughed and giggled. It's just a fun movie. John Goodman and Micheal Douglas were great."
1,ONE NIGHT WASTED,"What was I thinking when I rented this piece of garbage? I already knew Liv Tyler is nowhere near a good actress. So, what was the point? Maybe I got ""hooked"" by this being the debut film of Michael Douglas company. Maybe because it had Goodman, Dillon and even Reiser in the cast. Maybe because I was searching for an easy and good laugh. In any case, I sure regret my choice. This movie is bad tasted. Liv's character is obnoxious. It's no the kind of ""anti-hero villain"". She is just unbearable. SO, you just don't care about her, if she had a background that turned her into that kind of person or whatever. When you have a screenplay where you simple don't care about the main character, the movie is doomed. The male characters attempt hard to be funny, but with mixed results. The general result is a fiasco, a real turkey."
1,Bad Movie,It was so bad I fast-forwarded about 80% of it. That should tell you something... It's not even worth a review.
4,Far better than it should be,"This should have been another throw-away, boring, sex-comedy. The fact it isn't is due to some smart casting, and an excellent narrative structure that really drags you in and keeps you interested, and smiling.The entire movie, save the finale, is told by our three male leads to three different types of confidants. We see the story told and interweaved between them, and see how each one's version of events is clouded by their different obssesions with Liv Tyler's Jewel, the Female Fatale for the MTV generation. ""How can you have a top-notch entertainment system without a DVD player?""This movie even manages to pull two watchable performances out of Andrew 'Dice' Clay!Watch this movie with a beer, chips, and low expectations, and you are in for a suprisingly good time."
3,"Naughty, funny, violent at times","I see the average rating for this is 3 1/2 stars, which is probably what I would give it if I could use 1/2 stars. First of all, if you are a Liv Tyler, Matt Dillon, John Goodman, or Paul Reiser fan, you should watch this, no question. They all have great parts. I like the way this recaps events from several characters' points of view. Sometimes amusing, but also maybe a bit of a lesson can be learned, even from a film like this one, which is certainly not intended to teach anything. There are some fairly explicit sexually oriented scenes in this film, and some pretty graphic violence. NOT for the squeamish. There is humor throughout, and one bit at the end which should go down in history as one of the simplest, yet funniest, exterminations of an annoying character, ever."
3,Could have been so good!,"With a cast like this, and a premise as funny as this, you really wanted this movie to be better than it was. The writers definetly fell short, although the actors did their best to save it. Really the thing that was disappointing about it was not the movie itself, rather, that it fell short of the greatness it could have achieved with a bit more effort.That being said, we enjoyed this DVD. It was entertaining, although I don't regret not running out to the theater to see it, but I am glad I rented it."
3,mediocre,"While moderately entertaining, McCools didn't have very clean edges. Where a movie like ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" was obviously well crafted, this movie had a McFeel (as in McDonalds) of being an immature work that could have used a bit more editing. There are three or four nice jokes, and this is certainly an interesting take on Liv Tyler. Matt Dillon has played this role before, as has John Goodman, but who really wants to see Paul Reiser and his tighty whities (sic)? Go ahead. Watch it once. But if this movie became a cult favourite, it would be more of a comment on a paucity of cult-worthy movies than anything else."
2,another comedy falls flat,"This is another comedy that just doesn't seem to work. It could have been good. Good idea, great group of actors. It's the writing where it fell short. The jokes are juvenile and they fall short. The plot holes are huge. It just isn't funny. I finished watching it, just out of curiousity, but it really isn't worth the time."
1,Male fantasies,"The mystery is why in the world would Michael Douglas want to be one of the producers and appear in this awful movie. Yes, Liv is gorgeous but that doesn't justify wasting a couple of hours on this. Watch it on TV, don't rent or buy it."
4,A fun flick for all,"Well done, well written, well directed, well acted...just an all around enjoyable film, for anyone and everyone to get into :)"
4,"Great fun, great cast, great trash!","This movie is pure fun!The characters are overdone in a trashy way, but the director has concepted the whole movie along this path.Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser, John Goodman and Andrew Dice Clay are really good, but the true stars of this flick are Liv Tyler (talented, beautiful, and after ""Lord of the Rings"" hopefully in the ""superstar""-status she deserves) and Michael Douglas (a great (bad hair day) cameo, where he seems to have dressed up as his dad (Kirk Douglas) - watch for the simularities!).I can't understand why this movie didn't do better at the boxoffice, but now it's up to VHS and DVD to give it the attention it deserves!"
2,Michael Douglas's Hair,"The funniest thing in this movie is Michael Douglas's hair. The second funniest thing in the movie is watching Paul Reiser run down the street in a bizarre leather S&M getup. The sad thing is, I can't even come up with a third funniest thing.This is a discouraging comment about a comedy.This is a strangely compelling movie though. I gave it only two stars because comedies are supposed to make you laugh, and this one didn't, but something about it stuck with me. I guess I identify with these guys who are being manipulated by a beautiful sex goddess. And I do hang out at a bar eerily similar to McCools, albeit a much smaller bar. I've met some sexy, manipulative women there too, now that I think about it.If you're looking for a movie with any depth, or any soul, you won't find it here. The movie tries to combine the best of the Farrelly brothers with the best of the Coen brothers and fails. Such stunning mediocrity is depressing."
5,Interesting and Understandable,"I found this book at the Darwin Exhibit at the American Natural History Museum in New York. It really tells three stories: the life of Charles Darwin, the state of science in his lifetime and all the scientists who were formulating supporting evidence, and the theory of evolution. It treats the subject of religion respectfully, but makes clear the difference between religious faith and science theory. I plan to give it to our elementary and middle school libraries. Every library should have one."
1,remarkable,"Laughingly inadequate, poorly researched, badly written, full of lies. Has a hidden agenda. Made lots of money for the author. Full of untenable claims."
1,sad,i can only say that this author has to resort to making up large parts of this book because the truth doesnt agree with his theoriesits one of those books that invents when the facts go against its wishesdyn peryglus ac eithafol dros ben ydyw
4,"good book, but","The book is a good culmination of the seris. I talked to the author about the last book being out of print and he told me you can use kendle or download it to a pc at B&N. Anyway, good luck to the guys asking eighty dollars."
5,4th Book Available on Kindle,Hi Everybody I was just looking at the comments of this series and found that the 4th book has a mark up of $70-$500. I just thought I should let everyone know that there is a Kindle Edition of the book and it is 4.99. And for those of you who do not have a kindle you can download the kindle for PC application for free then buy the Kindle version and read it on your PC. In case anyone just really needs to read it. The Kindle Edition is Reckoning (Kindle Edition)Oh right and I do not work for amazon or Kindle. Just in case someone thinks I am trying to promote it. The next time this book is printed will be in July 2010. On other sites you can already preorder. You might also consider reading it as an ebook for free if your College library has ebooks for checkout online.
3,"enjoyable series, this kindle edition full of typos","The typos and formatting cause me to rate this at 3. I did not find problems with the first 3 in the series, but with the last book it was serious enough to cause confusion at times. Is it enough to make me wait for the next edition and pay $3 more? Probably not.But as to the series: it's not the Harry Potter series or the Hunger Games series, both of which were incredible, excellent, love them to death and re-read multiple times good, but it was pretty enjoyable. It has my favorite theme- the protagonist rises to the occasion even though he'd rather not. And it has a very sweet talking dog. (Anything with a talking dog is worth a look in my book.) I did get tired of the angels, however. How could any beings so nasty and conceited have ever been good? The second book, Leviathan, was the weakest. It seemed like an unrelated story who's purpose was to allow a few loose threads time to develop."
4,Good enough descriptions,"Not my favorite boat building technique, but this book would allow you to get it done, and get it done right."
4,Wood and Canvas Kayak Building - review.,"This is an excellent how to book which has stood the test of time and is relevant to any ""back yard"" kayak builder.Text and pictures are well laid out and easy to compare. The author has a sense of humour which add to the reading enjoyment."
5,George is Great!,"Finally found a quick, down and dirty kayak design and build primer!(makes one anxious to build ,or, should I say, ""roll"" their very own boat design)Mystery of the boat's ""innards"" from keelson to gunwales- George readily explaines in a ""'round the campfire"", down-right friendly, fashion.Putzs' hand's-on attitude and the ""you too can do this"", plus, the two acommpanying tried and true blueprint's / offsets, make's for easy to build, easy to modify - plans and materials selections.Do I recommend it? Heartily !"
3,"Good, but there's better out there.","I purchased this book and a few others as some research reading before I build my own kayak. I found this books build method was a bit more cumbersome than needed. It has you build forms that attach to the floor of your shop, then you build around them and remove them after the build. It's a lot of plywood, and bracing to get the forms in the right place. It also assumes that your shop has a wood floor to nail to, I don't know how to successfully perform this build on a concrete floor. This could be simplified significantly with a strongback building technique. I found Christopher Cunningham'sBuilding the Greenland Kayak : A Manual for Its Construction and Usemuch more informative. This book is well written, and informative, I just think there are better methods out there."
3,A Middling Good Mishmash of Maxims,"Professor Irving Younger gave Ten Commandments for cross examination. Brown goes Younger twenty better, but I'm not sure it's an improvement. Most of his advice is sound, but he wanders astray on a few occasions. ""30 Maxims"" is a workmanlike effort, but not of the first order of excellence. I'd give the book two stars if it weren't so inexpensive. Someday a modern lawyer will write a book on cross that tops the century old ""Art of Cross Examination,"" by Francis Wellman, but that time has not yet come."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this DVD unless,"unless you want to see a smattering of very expensive hotels, spas, tour companies, etc, etc, etc. Hopefully you get the idea. It's pretty, but it doesn't really give a true overview of the country or even a small part of it."
1,infomercial agreed,"I think this DVD should have been a freebe from the Costa Rica Hotel & Tourist Dept. It really just advertises upscale hotels, which are helpful but not what I wanted from this DVD. Some of the countryside is covered and a few other tips and sights However, with such a beautiful country as the host describes they really needed to show it instead of the hotel rooms, pools, restaurants, interviews with the hotel owners...you get it. I'll look to Globe Trekers, or Lonely Planet for an extensive look at the country, culture, people etc....my copy is up for sale on ebay."
1,Nothing but an infomercial!,"This is nothing but an infomercial about 5 expensive hotels and the tours they can arrange for you. There is little or nothing about the history, culture, or points of local interest. Plenty of shots of the hotel rooms and swimming pools, and how to get a massage from a Parisian with a bad accent.It is narrated by some valley girl who is more interested in showing you her bikini than the country. Gushy dialog but at least she gets the pronunciation correct.This is not a travelogue, it is an embarrassing waste of time."
2,"Traveler's Guide, huh?","This DVD shows very little of Costa Rica. It is an infomercial for spas, hotels, and tourist companies. I was looking for something that would cover the different regions, wildlife, and people. I can find hotels, spas, etc. online. The host is even annoying; I think she was trying to make her modeling debut. This DVD covers very little of anything. Disappointing."
5,I loved this dvd,"You must but this dvd. I loved the hidden spa and hot springs, hidden underneath the volcano, very magical."
5,Excellent tour of Costa Rica,"I would recommend this video to anyone interested in learning more about Costa Rica travel and wildlife. Great shots of monkeys, sloths, hummingbirds, Arenal, etc.Some of the country's best hotels are featured, along with local tours and restaurants."
2,"Costa ""Richa""","I am so disappointed that there isn't more on DVD about this neat country. We wanted to learn more about the country as a whole; people, different provinces and areas, the economy, etc. What we got was a host who is about ten minutes old, lounging in expensive resort spas and looking at rain forests and waterfalls. And I'm sorry guys, but she is NOT amazing. We kept waiting for the informative stuff to come, but it never happened. We are not backpackers, looking for $15 a night places, nor are we interested in spending as much as possible in a trendy European resort. (From that perspective, it DID feel like a promo for these resorts. Period.) We wanted to see more diverse everything, including common sense hotels, transportation, etc. If you are interested in learning more about Costa Rica, buy the books, not this video. If you're over twenty five years old, you'll be disappointed, I promise you."
2,Not good..!,"I have to disagree with the positive reviews of the DVD written here. In fact, I purchased this Costa Rica Traveler's Guide because everyone was so enthusiastic. It was just terrible. My friend and I are going in April, and are trying to figure out what to do and see. This was nothing more than an extended informercial - segments discussing very specific hotels, resorts, and tours. It just seemed like everyone had paid to have thier places shown..! No discussion of the regions, the options, the choices. Just an uncomfortable, terrible actress shilling for the producer's friend's resorts. Save your money and just tivo 'Costa Rica' and watch the Travel Channel."
1,I want those 52 minutes back...,"ok, well i guess ill list the positives first: The film is only 52 minutes long, and there's monkeys - that's about it. Anything else that may be somewhat entertaining/educational is due to the country itself, not the way it was shot. That annoying thing blocking the camera is the host, who also provides a pointless narration. About 20 minutes is wasted watching her eat something, blocking a nice sunset, or trying to pull off a personality. Another half hour is spent listening to ex-american hotel/resort owners babbling about the posh sense of style of their establishments.Once you get past the out-of-place host, shaky camera, infommercials, and tons of filler, there is some nice ""stock footage"". If you plan on taking a trip there, this will probably not help you in any way. Buy the books."
4,Thalia Icon,"This is one of the Best Remix CDs I've ever hoard. All the songs are hits from here previous albums. They seam to be done using a different DJ for every song. This Album proves why she is an Icon, to the sistas. It will gives you a club atmosphere. I rated this Album a 4 because, after listening to it for so long it drops one star. But still remains one of my Favorite. One you will really enjoy. Favorite song : No Me Insensate."
5,THALIA is Amazing!!!,"This CD is a wonderfull colection of the principal thalia's singles, but in this case all the songs are remixed by: hex hector, pablo flores, estefano, hitmakers etc.This compilation of greatest hits includes the ""A Quien Le Importa"" video as well as a special and never before released medley of the songs ""Entre El Mar y Una Estrella"" and ""Arrasando"". this is the track list:1. A QUIEN LE IMPORTA (HEX HECTOR/MAC QUAYLE CLUB VOCAL MIX) 7:182. IT'S MY PARTY (ENGLISH) 3:583. AMOR A LA MEXICANA (CUCA'S FIESTA MIX) 6:544. PIEL MORENA (HITMAKERS MIX) 5:155. MUJER LATINA (REMIX ESPANA) 3:556. THE MEXICAN (HEX RADIO VOCAL MIX) 3:327. NO ME ENSENASTE (ESTEFANO REMIX) 4:198. ENTRE EL MAR Y UNA ESTRELLA (PABLO FLORES CLUB MIX) 10:539. POR AMOR (PRIMERA VEX REMIX) 4:4010. TU Y YO (BALLAD) 3:3011. EL MAR Y ARRASANDO MEDLEY 4:0712. A QUIEN LE IMPORTA (VIDEO VERSION)"
4,The Other Side of Story,"I have always been firmly on the pro-religious side of the issue of Separation of Church and State. Because I generally witness those espousing the view that church and state need to be separate as being on the rabid left fringe of society, I never gave any thought to whether or not there was a legitimate reason for wanting this beyond the kook fringe simply wanting to erase all moral controls in order to do whatever they liked in society. I now find that the reason the separation of church and state was designed to prevent the government from dictating religious issues to the churches. That I can buy into. I'm still rather concerned about how our government can function in an overly secular environment, but I've at least modified my view to comprehend that we do need to be mindful that barriers to government intrusion in religious matters need to remain firmly in place."
4,"Cool Mind, Warm Heart",I very much enjoyed reading this book. I had read an excerpt in our local Free Press and wanted to read more of his writing. I was not disappointed.
5,Tangilbe perspective,"At age 45, after considering I've been in the driver seat of my life for the last 14 years provided many opportunities to at the very least give up whining about my circumstances, and on the brighter side recognize my capacity to create, lovelier things. The essay's written by Steve Roberts, however, broadened my perspective even further. Distinguishing power as an ability to be resilient in the face of any eventuality opened my heart to endless possibilities. I have been most struck by the simplicity of experiencing ""Love"", & ""Being Loving"", as perhaps an ultimate goal along with listening to my heart. Moreover, owning that I am the knower in my life. With gratitude and deep appreciation I thank you Steve, for sharing your life and your wisdom. I recommend your book often usually followed with a desire to know how it was for them."
4,Laid-Back Auditory Landscape,"I've been looking for hip background music for work.This creates an incredible vibe that doesn't become TOO much. Mellow beats, Cool jazz samples, modern and mature. Every client that has listened to this has commented on the unique mood this can create."
2,Law&Order--in the world of myth,"Before ""Law&Order;"",Sam Waterson played the troll Ofoeti.This is a bizarre movie,not the least of which is the campy '80s party scene (complete with rainbows)&the; mermaid gazing vacantly at the camera.The opening scene is a hoot,in which the young boy stares--several times--at the goodies hanging in the window of a lingerie shop(???)One assumes this shows his adolescence&sudden; interest in girls.Kind of odd in a movie aimed at kids....The villain (John Lithgow??)is out to turn the troll's world into a development&it;'s up to the little boy to Save the Day.This is a weird,weird,weird movie--and it explains why Oscars tend NOT to go to fantasy movies (bad acting,bad special effects,awful plot)!"
2,not a true hits album...only live recordings,"""20 Great Hits"" is a collection of live performances, not original studio recordings. Additionally, not all of his greatest hits are represented here. If one is interested in a great Tom Jones ""hits"" CD, then your best bet is ""The Best of Tom Jones,"" which features 22 songs, all original recordings, and the best sampling of Tom Jones on a single CD that's available. For a collector, ""20 Great Hits"" includes some very fine covers, including ""Unchained Melody,"" ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" and ""Let It Be."""
4,A good book to read before you begin,"I have been working to implement an effective measurement system in government for some time now. My search is somewhere between the panacea of sure thing quick fixes and ""it can't be done"". This book uses a no nonsense approach which clearly understands the real world side of measurement in government. I am getting copies for the city council and management team as I am hoping the views shared here will draw each participant from their secure pessimism to a middle ground. Let the measurement experiment begin and count whatever progress is made a victory. I think this summarizes the objective of the author quite well. Well written and ""real""."
2,Very Disappointing,"I always loved and respected Robin Harris. He was taken from this world too soon.This DVD includes perforances by other comics. I bought this DVD to see Robin Harris, not anyone else.The DVD also has a few people talking about him. It's nice to see their love and respect for him, but I aready love and respect him...that's why I bought the DVD!Based on the amount of Robin Harris content on this DVD, it should cost about $3This DVD is better than nothing. But I would love to see at least a two DVD set full of Robin Harris's standup material.All I can say about the people who put together this DVD, is...test tube baby!!! LOL"
2,Oh Well!,"This was not one of my favorites. He wasn't that funny to me in this DVD. But I am still glad to have it, mainly because these older shows when people are up and coming shows you just how far they've come."
1,Save UR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are a true robbin harris fan dont waste your money,beacause the little skits you do get to see are very short.And as you start to get into the few that are on the dvd another comedian jumps in with his opinion on why robbin harris is funny I literally was fast fowarding every few minutes to get past them in hopes of finally watching robin harris with no interuption.The dvd reads like you'll be watching robin harris but you wont..........very dissappointing save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Major disappointment,"Perhaps my hopes were too high. I wrongly assumed that the DVD would primarily be Robin delivering his outstanding standup comedy. Instead, much too large a portion is devoted to other comedians talking about Robin. In addition, some of the stand up segments performed by Robin look as though they were taped using home video equipment. The picture is grainy & the sound is very poor during these segments. What as shame, as this could have been a great offering. Robin Harris was a true comedic genious. It is too bad that a better collection has not been assembled showcasing such."
4,Very Good,"Robin Harris was a Funny Soul Brother period. this Dvd captures Harris at his Peak,but not enough footage overall. there still really hasn't been a DVD that fully captures Him all the way that showcases his greatness. but this DVD I remember seeing on Cable back in the day. Robin Harris personally ushered in a whole new era of Comedy&if you don't know then you should check out his work because Robin Harris left a lasting impression. RIP."
1,very dissappointing,this dvd was not what i expected. there was very little stand-up footage of robin harris and way too much commentary from uninteresting comedians .WASTE OF MY HARD EARNED CASH!
2,Poor Quality,"For the first time in all of my years ordering from Amazon, I'm really disappointed. The Prime 2-day shipping was excellent and on time as always. But the product was cheap and drab, arrived in an already used box without any receipt, and doesn't even fit the bed. Based on this experience, I would need to order a king-sized comforter set to fit my queen-sized bed. The matching shower curtain & window treatments look like they were made from old, poor quality pillowcases. The whole set looks like it was made in the 70's & is being recycled. I expected much more from a name-brand like Laura Ashley. I rarely return anything, even when it doesn't match my expectations, but I am sending this back immediately."
3,More like a double than a queen.,"This set is very pretty, but it's just not big enough for a queen size with a modern (thick)mattress. It's neither long enough nor wide enough."
5,Key Chain,This was a Christmas gift. My son loves these key chains. He has them hanging off of his back pack.
5,byakuya keychain,"OH WOW!!! I AM IN LOVE! the only thing i dont like is the purple eyes, his eyes are gray. but that must be a factory thingie? anyways....cool!!!"
3,Introduction to the Conga drum,Mine came with an audio CD only I was disappointed. I felt the DVD would help learn the techniques quickly.
3,New language?,"If you are reading these for enjoyment, you just might be in luck. With the modernised spelling, the plays are a little more fun, but they do lose some of the their scholarly merit. The original language gives us more insight into the times and the original purpose of the plays, but this gives modern readers a road to the mystery plays."
5,Awesome Double Gig bag,"I took a chance on this one , but I couldn't be happier. fits my two warwicks all safe and snug . the main pouch is big enough for lots of stuff, so you can take what you need and has a nice padded handle , feels good in the hand . Also has a little handle up by the headstock so putting in and out of car is an easy task. would recommend highly , at this price it is a steal .."
2,Only For The Hardest of Hardcore Joe D'Amato Fans,"I wanted to give this a 2 1/2 star rating but decided to round it down rather than up. First, don't be fooled by the title. There ain't no Cannibals. It is a VooDoo sect in the Dominican Republic. Yep, the same place from which came Erotic Nights of the Living Dead. This is typical Joe and there is plenty of nudity. If rated it would probably get an ""R"". The editing was sloppy to say the least and it was grainy at times. This might be an OK rental for a one time viewing, but not to own.Unlike some of his other works, the sex is pretty bland and didn't appear to be his main focus, which I find somewhat unusual, all things considered. Charlie S."
4,Delightful horror porn environmental fable,"D'Amato's best Caribbean film, with beautiful actresses, quite a witty script and a classic D'Amato mix of animal cruelty (a cock fight!), lesbianism, heart sacrifice and some political humour. Great framing and cinematography too. There's always another D'Amato film to discover, and this one is up there with the best."
2,A big disappointment,"I bought this book solely for the Bujold story about Miles' wedding, and was disappointed to find that Miles was a minor character, the wedding was background, and the main focus was a romance between Armsman Roic and Sergeant Taura. Worthy characters, yes, but not Miles. If you are a Bujold fan, you will probably want this story, but maybe it will appear in a later Vorkosigan collection.Reading the reviews, I can see that everyone bought this book based on one author they personally liked. Almost no one liked any of the other stories in the collection. This was true for me. Apparently, this collection afforded equal dissatisfaction for everyone."
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"The stories in this collection were pleasant but rather bland. Of all the author's, Catherine Asaro's work stood out as the best. The trend with these collections seems to be drawing in big names to sell the book; unfortunately, while these authors are accomplished at novel length fiction it is an entirely different matter to produce short stories, and it shows."
1,Very Disappointing,"What a disappointment! I was looking for a little romance in these stories but failed to find any. They are bland, trite, attempts at writing futuristic stories with unpronounceable names and places. I am a fan of Jo Beverley but feel she fell short in her writing skills with this one."
4,Bujold Shines!,"I only bought this collection for the entry by Lois McMaster Bujold, ""Winterfair Gifts"", which is about the marriage of her series-hero Miles Vorkosigan, and which is set between her recent series novels A CIVIL CAMPAIGN and DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY. I have not yet read any of the other stories, but this story alone is worth the price. It's not only about Miles's wedding, but also about more serious issues such as prejudice, trust, and some very old-fashioned romance (although one of the lovers involved is rather unusual). It's a wonderful read, and its only flaw is that it is too short."
2,For Bujold Completists,"I bought the book for the Bujold story, as this is the only Miles fix we will get for some time. And almost no Miles! But I enjoyed it anyway. I do think new readers would be puzzled. You have to know the backstory to follow the action.As for the rest, I tried to read each one, but just couldn't engage. The worst was the Putney, with its cliches and its total lack of historical sense despite all the right names and places; the Stover had an interesting idea, as did the Roberson."
2,Better to buy Winterfair Gifts alone as a downloadable audiobook,"Bujold's WINTERFAIR GIFTS is fun, but the rest are lackluster. My solution made me happy--I got rid of this book and bought WINTERFAIR GIFTS alone as a downloadable audiobook through audible.com.It's a good story to hear read aloud, and the reader does a fine job. I've listened to it a couple times already. I don't miss the other stories at all."
2,meh.,"Only the Barrayar set LMB tale is worth reading more than once, though I did also like the mage and Robin Hood stories."
2,Mostly resistible tales,"The collection has an intriguing premise: science fiction-romance crossovers (who knew?), but most of the short stories in the collection are almost painfully bad. A couple of nice exceptions: Jo Beverly's ""The Trouble with Heroes,"" which succeeds in creating a complex and potentially sinister hero; and Lois McMaster Bujold's ""Winterfair Gifts,"" which details a small but satisfying part of the Miles Vorkosigan saga. Vorkosigan fans may have missed this one (I did, for years) because it is not shelved with the Bs at local bookstores."
2,not worth the trouble,"Six stories; the Bujold is all right, maybe even four stars in its own right, but the rest of them range from mediocre to dreck, with ""Skin Deep"" being a notably low point. Bad story--obvious storyline, unconvincing dialogue, nonsensical plotting, embarrassing attempts at humor, random ""surprise!"" elements. Full disclosure here: I like Bujold, and SF as a genre, and not romance as a genre. If you're a Vorokosigan completist, you might want the book for ""Winterfair Gifts"", but otherwise don't bother."
2,"O, gentle readers, please do resist!","This book promises to bring Fantasy/Science Fiction and Romance together. Well, it does, but the result is less than satisfying. I bought this book as a SF/F fan and was disappointed, but I don't think Romance readers would have been satisfied with this shabby combination either.(And I do read enough romances) Authors tried to make one plus one two, and ended up with only one half. For other reviewers said enought, just let me complain about Deb Stover's _Skin Deep_. Frankly speaking, I don't think the author even knows what fantasy is. If you are a decent fantasy reader, skip this paranomal romance. I wouldn't be this harsh if this story was among the Harlequin collections....Simply put, it shouldn't be in a collection which claims to be a Fantasy/SF book."
5,Now THIS is how CARMEN JONES should sound like!,"Words cannot begin to sum up my joy that Decca Broadway finally deemed CARMEN JONES fit for a proper remaster. Oscar Hammerstein's lyrics set to Georges Bizet's classic score can now be heard clearly without distortion and this CD includes a complete plot synopsis and pictures. Now we no longer have to settle for that monstroscity from Pearl CD, which was an unauthorized recording, and I hope didn't take away too many sales from Decca Broadway. For musical buffs this CD is a must-have!"
2,Carmen Jones CD,"A friend had an LP of this many years ago, I always loved it which was the reason I ordered it. I have to say it wasn't as good as I remembered, sounded a bit tinny to me. I guess memories fade with time!"
2,Not a Fan,"Adapting operas into the musical theater style is not uncommon, but what is uncommon is using almost the exact same music as the original opera which Carmen Jones does. If you know Bizet's Carmen, you will immediately recognize the music on this CD... even if you don't know the opera you have probably heard some of the music. However, this adaption changes the libretto significantly. I personally am not a fan. If I want to hear Carmen I will listen to Carmen. If I want to hear Carmen in English, I could find a English translated recording. This doesn't fit. It sounds too much like the opera, even the singers are quite operatic. The new setting isn't different enough to give the listener something fascinatingly different. Whats the point? I don't suggest this, really, to anyone other than collectors. I don't even have a favorite song. Two stars and the only reason is it still uses Bizet's beautiful music."
5,Nearly Perfect,"Once we figured out that the adapter came with the camera and didn't need to have been in this box, it worked great. Just like AAKatz whose dot com's ""White Paper"" copiously described. It's nearly perfect, although getting it out of its protective plastic ""box"" is a booger."
5,Works great! No complaints.,"Seems to work great. No complaints so far - - does just what it said it would do. I do get very clear, very up close shots with this lens. Easy to use and figure out."
5,Great lense,Had another Macro Lense. but this Sony has really goood clarity when closing up on subjects.
1,May not work,"I don't know what they mean by ""latest generation"" but it does not work with my Nook Tablet Model BNTV250, purchased at Christmas 2011 (the crummy Nook design requires a non-standard USB micro with a longer plug, requiring purchase of their proprietary charger - very annoying). The charger works fine for my cell phone, so I kept it, but it doesn't do what I bought it to do."
1,Inaccurate readings,The monitor did not give accurate readings. It was always 60 or more points higher than the readings from other machines. If it was correct I would be st stroke level all the time. I returned it and will not buy another.
3,Not so accuracy,My wife has BP and everytime we check its showing normal readings. If we check in CVS formacy and Walmart BP machines the readings matched with the hospital readings which is higher side like 165/95. But this machine showing the normal readings like 131/83 eventhough the reading supposed to be in high.ThanksRamesh
1,Review,This product is very light and has a chance to break easily. To my point of view it's not as worthy as it's price.
2,Too much variation,"The WS-820 seems to work very well for some people and poorly for others. I am one for whom this item worked poorly. It fluctuated all over the place, and these fluctuations were as large as 30 mmHg. Things improved when I followed the recommendations of one of the reviewers, that is, to hold the monitor directly against my chest so that it was at my heart level. Nevertheless, I still see variations of +/- 20mmHg. That is simply too much variation to use for medical monitoring.Pity because this thing is very easy to use. But I cant recommend something that displays such variation."
3,Blood Presure Monitor Digital,Like all other digital Blood Pressure measuring devices there seems to have an error but not a huge error. To me the measured readings of Blood Pressure seem to be sometimes too good to believe and I have verified a couple of times. It is probably about 5 to 8 points below the actual pressure. Pulse readings seem to be accurate. Convenient to carry and can be used easily by older people.
5,satisfied,"as advertised, good product, right price, on-time shipment, wife happy, I'm happy, dog is happy, neighbors are thrilled, no ugly remarks from mother-in-law."
5,very accurate,"I bought this blood pressure monitor for my mom. It is extremely accurate (almost as accurate as the manual BP cuff), is easy to use, stores data for easy review of the precedent measurements!Great product. highly recommended"
3,Works,It works but only 3 stars worth. This is because you have to adjust it perfectly to get an accurate reading. If it is not in the exact right position it gives you too low of a reading.
4,Good Product,I think it is simple and easy to use and very compact. Instructions were easy to follow. No headache at all. I reccommend this product highly.
4,Better than nothing,"Well, yesterday was the first time I got an error message not sure exactly what happened but it's a pretty good product would purchase it again."
1,Not accurate,"I wasn't impressed by this particular wrist BP monitor. We used it on several clients and didn't get consistent readings. Not even for a wrist monitor. Crossed checked with brachial monitor and the Mark of Fitness wrist cuff gave readings for the same person of elevated pressures, i.e. 160/100, to pressures that were normal. Several re-checks were performed to substantiate findings."
2,Never reads out on the first try.,"I takes about three times to get it to ""rev"" up. I had similiar one and it always read out on one try. Do not buy this model"
2,More like Snoring Lamb,"Another compilation w/good intentions falls flat. What a shame that what could have been the defining moment of alt-Christian music turned out just to be another sleepfest of spiritual songs. That said, there does exist 3 or 4 tracks worth a listen. Indeed, the Vigilantes of Love rendition of Bruce Cockburn's ""Wondering Where the Lions Are,"" the Over the Rhine song, and the Ashley Cleveland tune almost make this CD worth purchasing. The rest is just uninspiring filler."
3,It's... interesting.,"Whoever compiled this CD certainly went for variety. I have to say there are several tracks that I'm not terribly fond of, but they're decent. If you're looking for Jars of Clay or Burlap to Cashmere or Sixpence None the Richer to shine on this album, you're going to be terribly disappointed. I would recommend getting the Exodus CD or their individual albums. I have to say the only redeeming quality of this CD is the Michael W. Smith/Stephen Curtis Chapman duet. It was so cool to hear these pioneering Christian artists sing together and blend so well. I LOVE that song. As for the rest- I'd say save your money."
4,How could it go wrong?,"With all these good artists, how could this CD go wrong? The highlight of the album is the combination of MWS and Steven Curtis Chapmen, as they are both excellent artists. A must for any Christian music fans!"
2,no good,this is like an example of ccm just trying to put out a cd to get a few bucks. There are only like two good songs on here which i cant really even remember...and the rest of the cd goes down hill. maybe some of them would be fine if they the artist keep it on their cd...but just all the songs were slow and not that intresting to save the cd.
3,I don't care what anybody says -- Bill Mallonee is good,"Most of the reviewers so far haven't realized what a cool thing it was to score Bill Malonee and the Vigilantes of Love for the album. Their work is sold at Christian bookstores, but Bill said he doesn't consider them a Christian act. Anyway, they have a large following in their hometown of Athens, Ga., and their music is listened to by fans of bands like REM and other ""secular"" artists. The fact that Bill contributed a song to the album basically embodies the theme of the album -- going outside the Chrisitan world to get to new listeners and spread the message. And I think ""Lions"" is a good departure from the soft-rock tone of the rest of the album."
1,Caution,"There seems to be a real mixed response to this. I was dissappointed.A number of the reviews tend to be based on the artist roster or the lyrical content. That is a shame, because musically I felt this to be a very bland mish-mash. The inspiration is great, the roster of artists impressive, the end result...?I rarely listen to any track other than the Jars of Clay offering ""Headstrong."" Consistent with other Jars of Clay material.""Christian music"" tends to have a relative merit. It can often be good WITHIN its field, but not great in the grand scheme of musical achievement IMHO.Note: 1) The Delirious? track is a remix of a song previously found on a UK single2) The Sixpence None The Richer track is nothing like Kiss Me, or its parent album, again IMHO.There seems to be some dissappointed people giving this a large number of stars...Still, the variety of favourite tracks from revewiers shows that something worked very well."
1,Just Move On. This Product is not even worth your consideration.,"I purchased this product simply looking for a set of headphones that would work with my BlackBerry Pearl and were not an asymetrical head set. Right out of the packaging the retractable feature did not work properly. Once I plugged them up to do a test of the headphones in action, I was dissappointed to hear the music coming from the Blackberry's speaker. So they do not even work. Maybe because it was a BlackBerry, maybe not. Bottom line, even if problem is incommpatibility issues with the phone, having actually examined the product in hand, I still would not buy it. The materials feel cheap, and the cord is only 41 inches. which may be fine for people of average height, but at 6'2'' I found the length to be inadequate."
3,good for a season,I bought this for my bow last summer and I think its a good product. I have some problems with the lenght of the eye piece and it want work for my bow because I have to push it as far up the string as I can but it does work just fine and I would reconmend this to any archer looking for a tube peep site.
2,"supposed to be new, but was demaged","The book supposed to be new, I was buying it for a gift. Now I do not know what to do with it. Have no time to play with returning the item.... uff. All those money lost!"
3,Movie DID NOT do the book justice,"Well, I almost cried after I saw this movie. Based on a fabulous book, you walk in ready to see a beautiful memior come to life. Wrong. The movie, in an attempt to give it a climax (life doesn't have a climax), invented a plot and lost the point of the book. You don't get out, there is no fun. It is a form of social control and Kaysen makes that point. The movie made it look like summer camp. But I had to give it three stars just because I loved the book so much. I offered me great comfort while I was in the mental institution. Read the book, avoid the movie!"
4,Better than the Book,"This is better than the book, which is surprising. I never like the movie better. I thought the best actress in the whole movie was Brittany Murphy and not Angelina or Wynona. This movie doesn't do a good job of portraying mental patients, but it's fine just for entertainment's sake and not as a guideline for how things really are in life."
5,My favorite Winona Ryder movie,"I thought that Girl, Interrupted was a fantastic movie. The characters were so deep and each one had such a personality as a single people and as a group. The parts were so well casted! I give praise to Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie and Britany Murphy! Great Performance! I especially liked the emotions and feelings in the scene when Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie wrok together to calm down a hyper friend by singing ""Downtown"".Don't rent this movie. Buy it."
5,Thought provoking and alluring.,"I liked this movie and read the book, so I did see some discrepancies. Yet, Winona Ryder's portrayal is magnificent and made me question the stereotypes we put on the ""mentally insane."" After all, who are we to judge someone else when our lives are so messed up?All in all a wonderful film for those looking for a change from all the teen bimbo movies or slasher films."
3,Great performances save weak meladrama,"Great performances and interesting claustraphobic sets create an intense film. But.....after the first hour you begin to wonder where its all going. The only downer to the film is that it just plain gets thin. It was a good, and perhaps in a diffrent year would have had more recogniztion, but look elsewhere for serious hard-hitting drama."
3,Great acting - Weak structure,"First of all: the acting, especially that of the two main parts played by Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, is outstanding! Award-worthy!The movie itself, however, has some weaknesses. Especially in its structure: It does not overcome the obstacles you encounter when you convert a true story diary into a movie. In other words: The movie script is not properly worked through.Still, the story is very human, and the flashback scenes work pretty well. But the foremost reason to watch Girl, Interrupted is the sensitive Susanna (Ryder) and disrespectful Lisa (Jolie)."
2,I changed the channel,"After endless advertisements which really caught my interest, I made it a point to watch this movie when it made its television debut. I was disappointed. The movie drags, and while parts capture your attention, overall it completely lost mine. I cannot tell you how it ended. I finally turned the television off and found a good book. Winona's biggest interruption, I am afraid, was the time taken to do this movie. It could have had much more coherency and moved along more fluidly."
1,An 'interruption' would have been welcomed....,"Ignore the hype (not that there was much anyhow), ignore the 'Oscar' win (they never go to the right people) and most certainly ignore this dull and sickly 'melodrama'. Girl, Interrupted attempts to try and recapture the dark humour of the book but ultimately fails. The characters seem to be extras from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (yes, tics and all) and of course the obvious stereotypes are presented; fat girl, thin girl, extremely mad girl, dyke, etc. Even the introduction of Angelina Jolie as the psychotic and downright nasty Lisa fails to save this predictable mess from going downhill. Wonders how she bagged the Oscar, as her performance seems reminiscent of an OTT soap opera actress. Such a shame really, as the talented cast seem capable of better performances and films. A waste of time, money and talent."
5,Another true but rated R movie,"Lisa Rowe is portrayed bu the actress Angelina Jolie, She really knows how to act. This is a great movie if you want to see her bad siede. If you want more info e-mail me at JJ_025@lycos.com"
1,"Jolie, Interrupted","I read the book ""Girl, Interrupted"" a few years ago and enjoyed it. I was interested to see the film, but I didn't know how the book could really be translated into a movie. Mangold and Ryder took a stab at it. I feel it was mutilated. (I don't blame it completly on them.) The acting was seriously lacking, other than that of Brittney Murphy. Yes, I DO NOT feel Angelina Jolie did a good job of acting. She was nothing like Lisa, however none of the characters were the same. There were many details of the story that were left out. All in all I was disappointed. It's also sad that the only attention the film recieved was Angelina Jolie's performance, which was not Oscar (or even Golden Globe!) worthy. (Brittney Murphy gets one star, every other aspect of the film- 0!)"
5,mesmorizing,"The DVD is well worth buying, the extra scenes are fascinating, and the director's commentary really gives some new insight into the film. Lots of extras, and the movie itself is phenomenal!"
2,Eh...,"This could have been so much better, considering the talent involved. the acting was very good, but the movie was... well... boring. People have been comparing it to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest..."" I don't think so! That movie was far superior... I was expecting so much more..."
4,"Girl, don't interrupt me!","I liked this movie becuase it dealt with the tortured, suicidal female persona. However, the movie was kind of hard to understand and I had to watch it two times. Overall, a well-deserved movie that is superb and beyond your average flick."
2,Girl Interrupted has a great cast.,"The movie itself lacks quality and meaning. I can't fathom how bad it would be to sit through if it didn't star Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder. If you're huge fans of either, than it's worth watching. However, if you want to see an excellent movie about psycho therapy and the mental ward, then see 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest' staring Jack Nicholson. I give Girl Interrupted two stars, one for Angelina and one for Winona."
4,"Oh, how this movie touches home!!","As i watched this movie, I felt many feelings, both bad and good, welling up inside me. Wynona and Angelina both did an excellent job of portraying people with major problems. I am a former struggler of depression, and my goodness, did Girl Interruped ever strike home. By the way, a real psychiatric hospital is much more of a hellhole than was shown here in this movie. I highly recommend viewing this movie. Sensitive people must to overlook the ""potty language"" and get into the feelings of the characters at Claymoore."
4,"Been there, done that","I rated ""Girl Interrupted"" a 4 star not because it was so outstanding, with the exception of Jolie's performance, but because it was made at all.In the late 60's and early 70's in a time of political and social ambivalence, it was very popular and yes, fashionable to hospitalize teenagers and young adults. The movie, for me, was an incredibly disturbing flashback of a time I had pushed in the farthest reaches of my mind.""Girl"" was true to the daily life, give or take the hospital, but became muttled. I plan to read the book for more clarity but wish more people would see this movie. They need to see ""the other side"" and remember that unfortunately some of these hospitals created adults, from children, whose NORMALITY IS INSTITUTIONS. They live, they work, they raise families but are not quite ""in the swing"" of society."
4,"Excellent Cast, Intriguing Story","Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for her role in this film, but the real star was Wynona Rider, who cemented her claim as one of the best actresses Hollywood has to offer. The film is worthwhile simply for the performances, but the story works well enough as well. While the ""crazy"" roles were somewhat cliche, especially as compared with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", the story behind Susanna kept me fascinated throughout the film. Much like ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" this is a character study. We watch her multiple transformations take place in the context of the story, but the story is just there to make her that much more interesting.This is a film I highly recommend."
5,excellent choice,Great movie. Allow me to study individual characters and their interactions towards each other. Excellent acting.
5,"Great film, great actors","I have read Susanna Kaysen's memoir, and so I have wanted to see this film for quite a while, and I am glad I have finally seen it.The film is very similar to the book, but there were some changes, which makes the story a little less predictable. The film, like the book, illustrates the unpleasant and sometimes not so unpleasant aspects of the ""loony bin."" The film is both sad and funny -- I laughed and cried while watching it.The acting? One word: superb. Wynona Ryder's performance was -- by no stretch of doubt -- Oscar-worthy; she should have won an Oscar. Angelina Jolie's portrayal of the imbalanced Lisa was hilarious; she's an actress that's in it for the long haul. Whoopi Goldberg's acting was restrained, but excellent nonetheless.I highly recommend this film; it is this year's One Flew Over A Cuckoo's Nest. A must-see! Oh, and by the way, read the book!"
1,Absolutely a waste of time,"I was forced to watch this movie and take my word for it.....it was horrible. Maybe some people are interested in a girls relationship with a bunch of nutbags, if so this is a movie for you. If there was an award for worst picture I would vote this one in."
2,"hey winona -- if you wanted to go home so much, why didnt you just say ""beetlejuice. beetlejuice. beetlejuice.""?","a silly sophomoric take on the kooky girl goes to the nut house genre. it gets better than one star because of angelina jolie, acting the bloomers off winona ryder, who saw her career start downhill around this time. and if i have to see one more 60s-era movie that uses ""the weight"" on its soundtrack, i shall scream!"
1,just okay,"It was ok. Could of gotten into the other characters mental issues a little more, and Susannas trigger for mental illness."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A coming-out party for Angelina Jolie and little more, Girl Interrupted features some bad suplots (e.g. Brittany Murphy's character) and an uninspired conclusion; Jolie may be good, but the movie is not."
4,"Girl, Interrupted","It was an interesting movie, however I was looking for something which more was more educational reguarding Borderline Personalities. Fun Viewing, though."
4,Crazy but beautiful,"I like this movie, especially, the sentence, ""you're a lazy girl who's driving yourself crazy."""
5,Good movie.,"I really enjoyed watching this movie numerous times. Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder do a wonderful job of acting in this movie. It is placed in the 60's when a lot of people are doing drugs, the main character gets sent to a womens insane ward. If you like movies containing drama I definitely recommend this movie."
5,Locked up at McLean Hopital for BDP,"This is a wonderful movie with a great supporting cast. The script is compelling, better and richer than the book. It gives a realistic and accurate look of what it was like to be hopitalized circa 1968 at this institution for the rich . The actors are excellent and give a top-notch performance. The DVD has interesting features such as deleted scenes, comments from the director. Again, I like the movie much better than the book."
5,"Angelina Jolie plays Lisa, not Daisy","One otherwise good review incorrectly states that Angelina Jolie plays Daisy in this movie. Jolie plays Lisa, not Daisy. Both Daisy and Lisa are poignant and memorable characters. Jolie deservingly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance. It was Brittany Murphy who plays Daisy, and her more unsung performance is excellent also. Both these characters are doleful and deeply disturbed, but otherwise could hardly be more different. Daisy is obsessed and withdrawn. Lisa is brazen and agressive. It makes indeed a dangerous combination. They are just two of the considerable variety of mental patients that Susannah Kaysen, author of the book of the same name, met during her own stay in the institution. The movie is a vivid story of her trying to sort out her own condition while also dealing with the likes of Lisa and Daisy in their fateful conflicts."
4,Mad in a good way,"At the same time that her contemporaries were heading off to college in 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen (Ryder) was signing herself into a psychiatric hospital after trying to cure a headache by downing a bottle of aspirin with a vodka chaser. Done that, bin there, one might say.Girl, Interruptedis based on a 1993 memoir of the same name by Kaysen about her years of living madly. The film heads into manic overdrive toward the end but is for the most part a well-acted, sensitive portrait of a troubled young woman's journey back to emotional well-being. In a role that makes perfect use of her edgy fragility, Ryder registers more strongly than she has in recent films. As a psychopathic pal, Jolie (The Bone Collector) again proves mesmerizing, while Goldberg nicely underplays her role as a sympathetic supervisor."
2,Overall a dull film,"Within five minutes of this movie I realized I had seen the whole thing. But I continued watching due to a demand from the woman on my arm. As a screenplay writer I guess I can gain a very different perspective on this movie than she can, it can be summed up in two words. 1.) Dull. 2.) Predictable The plot is definately substandard, hence the review thats below even an average 3 stars. Silly lines that I could say with Ryder's character as she said them like when shes confronted with the fact that she had a whole bottle of liquor and an entire bottle of aspirin, ""I had a headache."" More like you used to have an excellent acting career, and now you're only making headaches. The movie actually seemed to end several times. After I had watched an hour and a half there was an actual conclusion to the movie, but then it seemed to start up again from about the middle of the plot, and this happened again fifteen minutes later. This film really isn't worth viewing, let alone buying."
5,girl interrupted,"girl interrupted is one of the best dramas i've ever come across. its a movie that will make you think about writing an inspiring review after watching.MS. RYDER needed that movie therapy or she would probably be stealing cars instead of clothing. =D . JOLIES acting was supierior. she hit her character like no-one else could have done.i won't say anything negative about her cause she could kick my a**. ;P WHOOPI was great, BRITTANY was eat'n-chicken psycotic, and JARED wore a fake beard. this movie is completely inspiring and you would remeber it for quite some time.typed by her daughter colette <------------- xD"
2,"doesn't really follow the book, does it?","Lots of extra stuff that wasn't in Kaysen's memoir--that bothers me. It just seemed like it was a chance for Winona Ryder to attempt ""real"" acting, and to gain respect as an actor. Instead, Jolie snagged the Oscar, and Ryder slipped into A Scanner Darkly.Ryder again showcases her highly over-emotive acting ability that has been overrated from day one, and Jolie gets to look crazy and beautiful at the same time for the umpteenth millionth time. YAWN.Read the book instead."
4,"Movie, Excellent","""Girl, Interrupted"" is the story of Susanna (Winona Ryder), a troubled teen who ends up in a mental institution following a botched suicide attempt. Based on a true story, this film is very similar to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" expect for the fact that Susanna is self-committed and this movie has a relatively happy ending. There are a number of stellar performances in this film, and although Ryder was given top billing, Angelina Jolie steals the show as Lisa, a disturbed patient, the role which ultimately won Jolie an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's intense, dramatic, and jarring, and the cast is superb, with the exception of Whoopi Goldberg, who is just sort of floating around the hospital playing a nurse. Still, ""Girl, Interrupted"" is definitely worth seeing."
2,Sporadically engaging film,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did it much, much better. Girl Interrupted drags up too many cliches and only managed intermittently to retain interest for me. It begins well, and I was genuinely fascinated by the way the film pulled us into Winona Ryder's mind, but after an hour I found myself looking at my watch and praying for it to end: None of the characters managed to keep much more than a slender hold on my sympathy; and I got the uneasy impression that we were supposed to look up to Whoopi Goldberg as some sort of strong, admirable maternal figure simply because it WAS Whoopi Goldberg, in the absence of any real depth to her character. The central character's emergence from the brink of insanity into a mature, upstanding young role model of a woman at the end of the film was rather too sudden to be believable.A nice soundtrack helped, but ultimately Girl Interrupted was far too patchy."
5,Good movie,This is a riveting movie. Holds your interest for sure. Wynona Rider and Angelina Jolie both do a great job. As well as the supporting cast - Whoopie Goldberg is in it too.
2,demanded subject line,little depressing and simply didn't care for it what else is there to say except didn't like it so oh well
3,Interesting in a way...,"It seems to me that this movie lacked any significant plot. It was more like one of those movies that are just telling an anecdote about a portion of the main character's life. There's no real ultimate goal being strived for. We're just watching the characters as they go throughout their lives in this...it's not really an asylum, but I can't think of a better word.Winona Ryder gave a good performance as the lead character. Probably the best acting job I've seen her do. Angelina Jolie stole the show, though, with her portrayal of the psychotic and, at times, heartless Lisa. Her Academy Award nomination was well deserved. Whoopi Goldberg also does a very good job in her minor supporting role.The acting in this film was good, but the lack of plot kind of dragged the film down, IMHO. It was an entertaining movie to watch, but I don't think I'd want to own it."
5,Gee. These Women All Look Pretty Normal To Me!!!,"This movie is set in an 1960's Mental Institution and stars Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. The other memebersof this cast consist of a Compulsive Liar, A Self Mutilator, a Lesbian, a Girl With A Secret and an Anorexic. These woman actually all look pretty normal comparedwith some of the women I've dated over the past few years. What I really want to know is how come Winona's character Susanna isn't being treated for Anorexia Nervosa instead of Depression?If you have the answer to this puzzle please Email me. I give this movie 5 stars becauseI kind of like Angelina Jolie.I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing?"
3,keepin it real,"angelina jolie definitly stole the thunder of winnona's storm. the film is very appealing because it gives you the eyesight into the ""ward"", and what may or may not happen in there...on the flipside it is nothing more but fullfiling all the ""ward"" cliches, not being real at all, believe me Claymore IS a hotel when compared to the actual pshyciatric ward, and the real struggle for ones breath that goes on in there....it is NOT real, it's not real at all, don't ask how i know....."
3,Compelling but predictable,"Call it the Title IX version of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" and you won't be far off the mark. Based on Susanna Kaysen's best-selling memoir of her two-year stint in a psychiatric hospital, this modestly compelling but thoroughly predictable drama has the flavor of something distilled from dozens of earlier, better movies. Even so, director James Mangold (""Copland"") plays fair by refusing to romanticize his petulant protagonist as a defiant free spirit. And Winona Ryder earns respect for her willingness to play Susanna as an undisciplined neurotic who often comes across as a pain in the backside. Oscar winner Angelina Jolie makes the most of her co-starring role as Lisa, a charismatic sociopath who infuses her casual cruelty with a taunting sexuality."
3,i LIKE TRUE STORIES,"One flew over...'ish with female cast. But, as I believe,it was based on a true story, which adds weight."
4,Better than expected,"I had heard talking about this movie awhile back but really didn't hear what it was about. Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie were great. I've always liked Winona. Not a big fan of Angelina, but she was good in this role."
5,girk interrupted,Everything was great..on time...great movie...I would reccomend this movie to others...it really holds your attention through the whole movie..great.dont knoe
4,great film for behavioral observation,"although jolie won the award for best supporting actress, ryder did a great job. her diagnosis would definitely not fit the DSM-IV-TR for borderline personality. interesting that she never understood what that meant. probably because it didn't really fit. she was just depressed; initially major depressive. jolie was the ""crazy"" one! anyway, an interesting movie based on a true story by the ryder character and set in the 1960s."
4,One Flew over the Girl,"Of course any movie made about people in a psychiatric ward will resemble the classic 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. This we also do not know for sure if the leading character is sane or not.Winona Ryder is great in this movie, though a little too pretty. The best perfomance comes from Angelina Jolie, who is just amazing. The movie is sometimes a little sad, frightening, scary but also moving. The ending is a little sweet but not too sweet. A happy ending with a twist.The music is great since it plays in 1968, although the theme of the sixties is a little underplayed. It is still a great movie though."
4,"""Girl, Interrupted""-Jolie makes this a winner!","Angelina Jolie is one of the best new actresses around. In ""Girl, Interrrupted"", she proves that she can play almost any type of character with this one being one of the craziest patients at a mental institution for young women. She really is the star even though the story is based around Winona Ryder's character. I liked the story, probobly would give it 3 stars, but Angelina was so great I had to give another one. I also liked it because I am around the same age as some of the chracters plus Whoopi Goldberg is also in it proving that she can do Drama as well as comedy. You really have to see this. At least make it a rental."
4,Closet Fan!,I am a closet Winona Ryder fan. She and Angelina Jolie tore up the screen in this psychotic rendition of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It may be hard for some to believe that for such minute indescritions many were hospitalized in the 50's 60's and 70's and deemed lunatics because they didn't conform to societies norm. This movie was touching and gives you insight into the thinking minds of those whose lives are INTERRUPTED.
4,Great Movie,"I didn't see this movie when it came out, just because I am not the biggest Winona Ryder fan. But then I saw this movie and I was amazed. Winona Ryder stars as a girl who has just tried to commit suicide. So she checks into a mental hospital where she meets some very interesting characters including Doctor Whick (played very subtly by Jeffrey Tambor), a Nurse (Whoopie Goldberg), and a wild fellow inmate (played wonderfully by Angelina Jolie). With all those elements, this movie is interesting, dramatic, heart warming, funny, sad and exciting. You learn some nice life lessons, while getting a great storyline out of the film too. There were some parts of the film where I was like...eh, I've seen this done before in a movie. It's all be done before. And that's right, it has all been done before. What's left to do? But seriously, even though it has been done before. This movie is great."
4,Nice casual sandal,"This is the first time I bought a shoe by Propet brand. I really liked the design of the sandal, which allowed me to adjust the velcro straps. This was important to me as I have wide feet and I am never able to find perfect fit.Though the photograph of the sandal makes it look dressy, I think it is actually for casual wear. The seams of the edges adds to this casual look (atleast that is what I think).I loved the red color- great with a pair of jeans. It is very comfortable, though I have not worn it for a long period of time at a stretch to really test it.Overall a great buy, especially as I bought it on sale."
3,Comfortable shoes,"After I wore the shoes the first day, they turned into a dog magnet. Not sure I can wear them now, but they are very comfortable and the width can be adjusted in two places. If you don't like your feet to hurt, buy these shoes. Dressy enough to wear to work."
5,to know Him is to love him,"This book helped me to come to know God more intimately. Such an intense study of the character, nature and attributes of God...that help those who want to know God up close and personal. Kay Arthur gave us the means to know that God is more than just a name, but His omnipotence is real, His omnipresence beyong what can be fathomed. In the Old Testament His people called on Him by His many names and it helped to understand how God is there in every aspect and every detail of our lives. This study was well written and delivers one into an arena that leaves you wanting to know more about the One True God."
3,Sylavnia TV/VCR Combo,"Great little TV, but the VCR part of this combo started kicking the VCR tapes out and turning the TV off automatically within 9 months of purchasing the unit."
1,"Sylvania 13"" TV/VCR Combo","Returned immediately because it didn't work. We turned on power and in less than 5 seconds, it would turn off."
2,poor electrical connection after 6 months,"This little guy was working fine until it just wouldn't come on one day. Turns out the electrical cord is loose and has to be jingled to turn on. Since it only had a 90 day full warranty on it, and I have only owned it since April... it is not worth getting fixed due to labor cost. This defect may be isolated...just wanted everyone to be aware of this problem with mine."
3,Spent too much for something easily breakable,"I got this tin teaset for my toddler, instead of the ugly plastic ones or the breakable ceramic ones. While it's very cute, I feel I spent WAY TOO MUCH on this. The tin is easily bendable and a lot of the pieces have been ruined/smashed, even though I keep things very tidy and organized. We're not walking on toys here. They just bend and warp from storage and use."
3,Cute but has led,"The tin factor contains led; therefore I wouldn't let my daughter pour water and drink out of it. She bent the spout and its loud when it hits hard surfaces. The tea set is cute; however, I will purchase another set that I feel is safe and can fully play with."
3,Not what I expected,"This tea set is cute, though not as cute as I expected. It's way smaller than I thought. I was hoping for something that could be a usable toy, as in my daughter could have real ""tea"" parties as well as pretend, but everything is so tiny. Mine also did not come with a lid for the tea pot. Overall I am disappointed and will probably be returning it. I was also surprised that I couldn't find a metal set with spoons."
5,Huge hit for the tea party crowd,"This tin tea set was apparently a huge hit with my 3year old niece. She's into carrying around her tea set for parties on the go. The tiny ceramic set just couldn't keep up, but this one can hold it's own in the backpack. It's also a better size for young motor skills than the teeny ceramics with teeny handles."
4,"Little, but cute","The tea set is just right for the 2 year old we bought it for. It is tiny, probably too tiny for her 4 year old big brother."
4,Very pretty and sturdy tea set,"I initially bought this set for my niece and was very impressed by how sturdy it was, and even more so by how cute each of the pieces are. The color scheme and designs on each piece are so rich and make for a very pretty and fun tea set. This is truly a must have item. I will be buying another set soon for my own daughter!"
3,Not reliable,"I purchased this to run the game in my classroom. The keys for the worksheets have many errors. The book suggests charging a 3% transaction fee for each trade... certainly not realistic. Game starts kids at $50,000, then tells them they have to buy 100 shares at a time, again, not realistic. This book was certainly a disappointment for playing the game. The actual information was fine. Do the calculations yourself though, don't rely on the key in the back."
5,Great Book,"This is another wonderful book, this writer knows what he is doing. There is so much mystery in this book."
3,Stone Barrington does it again!,"More woman, bourbon and a troubled client named Herbie Fisher. Its another quick page turner from Stuart Woods. These novels are fun if you read them in order. Agent Carpenter was in the previous book the short forever and now is involved in another case. These books are light reading and fun. The characters are liekable and that is what makes the series a good read."
5,Superb!,"Stuart Woods knocks out a winner! I have read several of his books and like them all but prefer the Stone Barrington series which are a combination of detective, mystery, espionage and thriller novels. The plot starts off as a high profile divorce case for a very wealthy woman and quickly extends into an international manhunt as La Biche makes her appearance. The dialogue is entertaining throughout and the plot is full of surprises. Stone is colorful and pleasantly flawed with some bad habits we secretly can enjoy.The Griffon Trilogy (Pt. I)"
3,Not as good as past Stone Barrington books,"While the core charachters are still the same: Stone, Dino, Elaine; the new ones are less developed and less interesting. This book is not as good as some of the previous Stone Barrington series. My suggestion would be to wait until it comes out in paperback or pick it up a your local library."
3,Not the best....,"I enjoyed this book, and it did keep me turning the pages...but to a certain degree. I thought that the plot was nothing different for Woods, and his Barrington series. There were some points in the book I was confused too...is Carpenter and bad girl, or is she a good girl?? It got a little tiring when ""La Biche"" kept changing her identity and it was hard to kepp up on who she was at that moment. Overall it was a good book, but I did not care for the overall story...better luck next time Mr. Woods....also I think that the author needs to get a new proofreader....found some spelling errors in the book."
3,Not very captivating......,"You sort of knew everything that was coming .... I was a bitbored ...read it in an afternoon -- not a ""page turner"" ...better luck next time Mr Woods"
3,Good...but not great!!,"This book was long awaited by myself..as well as many other Woods fans. I thought that the story was good...but not great. I found that the story at times was confusing with all of the ""aliases"" LaBiche used in the book. I had a hard time keeping up. This is a good story, and I have to say that it is a must read for Woods fan. Looking forward to the next installment."
4,"An Early Stone, Not to Be Missed","I've been a Stone Barrington fan for years. Somehow, I missed this gem. Stone gets involved in a complicated cat and mouse involving MI6 (or 5, the lines are blurred these day... ). The plot is complex without being overly so, the story moves swiftly and is not predictable. A must for SB fans,a great read for other suspense fans."
2,Stone Barrington plots revisited.,"I have read every novel of Stuart Woods. I was looking forward to the next Stone Barrington saga. Unfortunately, when I read this book it was like reliving many of the same plots included in Woods other books.The plot of this book was totally unbelievable. I read the other reviews listed. I honestly did not have the same impression.One small point, Woods does not finish the storyline that the story begins with.From the size of the print and line spacing it appears that Woods had to really stretch to make his 300 pages.One of the teasers from the last book was not followed up on. The Arrington character does not appear in this book, even though she was moving to New York and Barrington was desperately trying to reach her in the Short Forever.This book was not worth buying."
5,Wonderful characters,"Stuart delivers one of his strongest plots. Good characters and, for a change, a smart criminal. Stuart also has found a good ending, seemingly so hard in book writing today."
1,Dirty Work,"I eagerly awaited another Stone Barrington novel, and was very disappointed in this one!! The characters (other than Stone and Dino) were very boring, and towards the end when I hoped for an explosive conclusion, I was even more disappointed. Hopefully the next Barrington story will lift my spirits about Stuart Woods."
1,Total Disappointment,"I've always been fond of Stone Barrington. Well, after reading this little diddy, ""appalled"" would be a more appropriate feeling. I really can't believe Stuart Woods is the author of this giddy, illogical piece-of-fluff! Take some time off Stuart! This is not the kind of writing that will keep true admirers true!! I kept waiting for the book to get better. It didn't. After finishing it, I just sat in a dumb funk for a while, wondering why I had wasted my time reading the whole thing. Too bad............."
4,More of the Same and It's Good,"Woods' books are always fast, furious and exciting and that is why I have read so many of them. But at a point they seem to all be the same with different characters. Therefore, a few years ago I took a break from reading his books. In the past six months, I ventured back in and am very glad I have. He is not supplying life changing literature here but what he does provide is fast, exciting action that is very enjoyable. In this case, Stone Barrington is reacquainted with his long-lost flame, a new love interest involved with the district attorney office and a former CIA contact. All this revolves around a billionaire impressionist with very dark secrets. As expected, the book is fast with many plot turns and once again, I'm on the Stuart Woods' bandwagon. Great books for the beach or a plane!"
3,Light fare,"If you're looking for a light read & are fond of the Stone Barrington books, this is easily readable. I would not recommend it to those who like their mysteries more on the serious or involved side, nor would I call it a ""page-turner"" by any means. Enjoyable enough, however, if you want a quick, light read."
3,Nice Art,Good book if you want to learn about siege warfare. Lots of nice pictures and illustrations. Very interesting and easy to read.
2,Frustratingly Uneven,This is one of those books where a dictionary is essential if you are not very familiar with the terms used. Nice illustration but many poorly explained. Many illustration distant from explanatory text. I got this from a library. I won't be buying my own copy!
5,Love Vampire Films!,"Being from Philadelphia and loving indie films, I'm always looking to seek out and support film makers from not only Philly, but New Jersey, Delaware and New York. That said, I have always loved Vampire films and this one is very different!***SPOILERS***It's about a family of vampires that survive in the modern world by living off of a blood bank that they own. One night one of the vampires is attacked in the street by a mugger and she kills him, drinks his blood and contracts AIDS. What followa is how the vampire family deals with the situation.This film is an original and fresh look at vampire lore and is acted amazingly well by Matt Locker, Deana Demko and Cathy Loch. I didn't care for the one or two sex scenes in this, but that is a minor complaint. The special effects were decent and there is a very large cast, multiple locations and it's all handled well by director John Orrichio. If you like his style check out Dreams of the Dead and Abduction too!"
4,Great book on a complex character!,Casey was a very complex character. He was always on the edge -- always straddling that ethical line (and frequently crossing it). The book is fair and it gives a good overview of the former chief of two much feared agencies: the SEC and the CIA.
1,Wonderful for nails,"I really like how my nails look and feel after I use this treatment. I find I get the best results by removing my polish and using this nail balsam 2 or 3 times a day on the days that I don't work. I am a nurse, so my hands are in soap and water or alcohol based cleansers repeatedly on work days and my nails are in deplorable condition. I am endlessly searching for something to stop them from tearing and peeling. This product seems to help to moisturize them on the days that I don't work. I am still searching for a good strengthener/protector to wear on work days to protect my fragile nails.**Edited Jan 28, 2013** it was a short love affair. This product was nice for a few weeks, then my cuticles were becoming more and more dry. I finally found that my cuticles were better on the days I forgot to use this product. I have moved on to another product."
2,Might work for someone else,"Last winter I realized that my nails might have been peeling and soft most of my life because they were dry. I've tried many products and thought I was doomed, but last winter I started to rub an eye cream that I'd purchased long ago into the nail and the cuticle. Kind of buffed the surface also. Figured that I didn't have anything to lose. Made a huge positive difference! Also my husband has been annoyed that a particular nail he needs for playing the guitar keeps chipping and splitting. So i searched for a fingernail moisturizer for both of us and was surprised to find such a thing. Unfortunately the Trind didn't didn't work for my spouse, and the jury is still out on me as i can't give up my eye cream trick ( DHC was better than Estee Lauder). Have been using the Butter London polish occasionally as well.... Will let you know later if this works well for me in the future."
1,Made my nails dryer!,"I did not buy it from Amazon. I tried to, but the seller was out of stock. So I looked elsewhere online, and was able to find it. I'm sorry I did. My nails felt HORRIBLE after applying this balsam. My nails felt more dry and brittle after applying it. So much so, that a couple of my nails literally broke off at the tips shortly after applying. And I did NOT break them. My nails had this ""weird"" feeling, almost as though this stuff drained the life out them, and were terribly dry. NO moisture at all. It seemed to do the exact opposite of what it was suppose to do. But to be fair, I bought another brand at another beauty store, and my nails felt the same way. So in reality, the nail balsam's dry your nails MORE! At least it's what it did to mine. My high hopes were shredded. I hope others have better results, but for me, I'm tossing this stuff."
5,Great for nails and cuticles,This Trind nail balsam is a wonderful healthy treat for your nails. I have been using it for about a year. I have seen a difference in my nails and cuticles. It just soaks right into my nails and cuticles giving them the moisture they need. Highly recommend it.
2,short lived fun,"This toy has been on and off the market for a few years. Two years ago my daughter had one. It worked well and was lots of fun. But one day upon pulling the cord, it broke and wound inside the toy. There was no way to pull it back out. She was heart broken, so we bought her another one. This one lights up, like the current one. She was able to launch the toy twice before the string broke! I contacted the company and was basically told ""too bad too sad."" If you buy it, make sure it's somewhere you can return it to."
5,Peggy's shampoo,I recommend this product. I used to buy shampoo for my dog from the vet for twice as much. This works just as well.I'll buy it again.
2,Typical of Contest Entries &#65533; Inconsistent Quality,"This books holds designs for 33 samplers selected as winners of a ""Woman's Day"" sampler contest. Each piece is shown in full color, alongside a short story by the designer about the piece and a short biography of the designer.There are substantial and varying degrees of professionalism in these pieces. Some are great, others are ... not so great. Some are very detailed, others quite simplistic. Some of the color choices are, shall I say, interesting (but I wouldn't want them in my home!) There are enough charts in this book that make it a worthwhile supplemental addition to your stitching library. But if you're looking for your next *must have* book, this is not it."
4,works ok,this doesn't come with a foam kit so you'll need one of those. lucky for me i'm a tech for a Jeep dealer so we had one in stock. the quality of this looks cheesy and it doesn't cool as well as the stock one did but for $60 i am happy.
5,"GREAT CD, OF COURSE>","This CD, as all f his are, is great. I love, ""God, Family, and Country"", and ""I Love It"". The more I listen to Craig Morgan's music, the more I like him. His voice is so amazing, penetrating right to my soul, as do the words of his songs. He is such an amazing singer and song writer and his awesome morals and values come out in his songs."
5,THIS GUY IS AMAZING!,Craig Morgan is what country and country music is all about. If your looking for a meaningful album this is the one for you!!
4,"Good, but nothing to write home about","This is the Original London Cast, which means that sometimes you feel like a step back to the eighties. This is not the show that you will see today and features some of the best songs that are now defunct. Frances Ruffelle, Stephanie Lawrence and Ray Shell are delightful and believable in the roles they take. Jeff Shankley is a bit rough around the edges, but it's easy to get over this. The songs overall are very enjoyable, though the music seems unbalanced - something I noticed in the original 'Cats' recordings. The packaging is visually superb - I especially like how the libretto booklet has taken various years and combined them though I would wish they were in color. However, the lyrics are incomplete and there are mistakes in information provided. Overall, it's a good record."
1,I got gypped!!!!!,"I ordered a CD and in came in a timely manner. However, it skips horribly. My husband used a CD cloth on it, still skips. He washed it carefully, still skips. I have been taken for not much money, granted, but it is the principle of the thing. I will NEVER buy from Amazon again! NEVER!Jody Glasgow3857 Florentine Dr.Longmont, CO 80503303-485-5434"
3,"Why? Andrew, Why?","I can't believe this is by the same Man who wrote Phantom of the Opera. If you like Webber for Phantom, then DONT GET THIS! If you like Whistle Down the Wind by Webber, than you might like this as well. The story is a bit much, the songs get very repetitive, and the vocals are questionable. I just can't see spending almost 40.00 on a CD you wont listen to, but maybe twice. I would put this amount of money into Cats before this. ALthough, Starlight Express does have a quite a poppy edge so if you want something not so classical, this is ok. I still don't think its worth it. If you want a poppy musical get Tarzan. Favorite Song: ""Poppa's Blues"""
5,BUY BUY BUY,This cd is a perfect example at the genius of andrew lyodd webber. The music and lyrics merge to create a musical that will set a new standard. This cd is better then the new one. This is one that you will not let your friends borrow because they might hurt it . Thats already happened to me. BUY THIS CD. it is totally awesome
5,awesome music for an awesome musical,"This CD with the music from the musical Starlight Express,is fantastic! This is,in my opinion,one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's better musicals that he has ever done over the years.This musical opened up in London,in the Apollo Theater,near Victoria Station,in 1984.I was in London,in December of 1985,and we went to see this musical there at the Apollo.The stage setup is so awesome,as to how they wrapped skating tracks around the whole theater for the show,with seats scattered throughout the theater and also in the balcony,which is where we sat.Great seats,could see everything.This Cd,helps me relive some great times and brings back such good memories,not only of the musical itself,but of being in an awesome city like London for two weeks.I highly reccommend this Cd for anyone who loves 80's style music and musical productions.Even if you've never seen the musical in person,you will love the music."
4,The New Starlight is... Better!,"Bad Parts: None of the following songs are included: Coda of Freight, Crazy, Make Up My Heart, Next Time You Fall in Love, and the Starlight Megamix.Good parts: The cd has Call Me Rusty, There's Me, Rolling Stock(reprise), C.B., No Comeback, Only He, and Only You.Conclusion: If it had coda of freight, Crazy, Make Up My Heart, Next Time You Fall in Love, and the Starlight Megamix, it would be a great CD! Anyways, GET BOTH!"
3,Hasn't Aged Particularly Well,"Though by no means his crowning achievement, Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Starlight Express"" was a dazzling piece of fluff, directed primarily towards children. The futuristic staging and skate-wearing cast was amazing to look at and the score includes several pop gems.Best Tracks include:Rolling StockA Lotta LocomotionThere's MeStarlight ExpressI Am The StarlightOnly HeLight At The End Of The TunnelDefinitely not a musical to be taken too seriously, nor in the same league as ""Phantom"" or ""Sunset Boulevard"", the score for ""Starlight Express"" is simply fun..though I prefer the concept album recorded before the show's transfer to Broadway."
5,A wonderful peace of Music,"I can honestly say that Starlight Express is one of my favorit musicals of all time. Although it's basicly an adaptation of ""The Little Engine That Could"", it is by no means a kiddie show. And yes, the characters are trains, but like CATS there is excellent use of personification. The CD catches enough of the show for you to really feel for the characters.""There's Me"" is one of the sweetest, most romantic songs I have ever hold, and it's something that the newer version is lacking. U.N.C.O.P.L.E.D. is a very amusing peice of music, as is Lotta Locomotion.I'd highly recomemd this CD for almost anybody."
1,Play was freat,Not crazy about this version. I had an old cassette that I purchased from the play in Downtown Cleveland many years ago that was 95% better than this London cast. Very disappointed.
2,Good Reading for the novice.,After a mention or two about 9/11 the book is full of dated facts not relevant to today's dynamic anti-terror battle environment. It glosses over well know facts as new information. Pass on this.
2,Great book ten years ago,When this book came out it it was cutting edge but it is ten years old now and very outdated.
4,What will happen?,"Heat sickness pops Bailey Trumbull's life into two pieces because his dad gets it and forces him to move north from Texas to Montana. Will Bailey get chewed up by a bear or find himself in the eye of the great bear? Will Bailey be a coward or be brave? If you are in 4th or 5th grade, you are in luck because that is who I recommend this book to. What will happend to Bailey Trumbull? Read this book and find out."
2,Mediocre,"Pence seems to remember how to weave a mystery in this one- she forgot in the past few books. Its also refreshing that Angie does her best to be supportive this time, and not as pushy, letting Paavo's character finally get a little development finally after 7 books. The Angie which doesn't have to be so forceful is definitely an improvement- too bad Pence couldn't hold Angie back for more then this book, as Angie emerges self-centered and shallow (except for random moments of lucidity coming from seemingly nowhere now and then) and the bizarre background story to make it ""interesting"" (but really just ridiculous) in the next book, Bell Cook and Candle. This one though, is passable."
1,Don't even think bout buying that...,"Simple, boring and what's most important not original, these are just some extracts copied from other performers..."
2,title misleading,"The plot was very thin and misleading. The story line was very short.There were more sex scenes that seem to be exciting, but did notadd to the movie plot."
5,Absolutely Stunning!,"This is a really amazing CD. The music is very differant than what I was usually used to...First off, this band is piano and drum based. Yes, you can hear some guitar, but the majority of what you hear is piano and drums, which I think is very cool. The style of music is pretty much U2+piano. So, if you like U2, chances are you will like this.Also, the lyrics are very nice. You can really tell that these are God loving people...Overall I was extremely happy with this album. It is truly amazing!"
5,Great for Elvis Lovers,"This was purchased as a gift for a member of my bridal party. I filled it with goodies before rewrapping it and distributing it to the recipient. Very well receieved, original wrapping idea, and will hopefully last forever!"
1,small characters,"The book itself is very interesting, but the characters are so small that I regreted that I ever bought this book.Next time please warn customer about this serious defect."
2,I was expecting something interesting...,"Holly Valance isn't a bad singer, and her lush singles Kiss Kiss and Down Boy really backed that up, however, the resulting album Footprints is quite bluntly, boring and unoriginal.Once whacked into the CD player, your greeted by the sultry Kiss Kiss, followed by another middle-eastern flavoured groove called Tuck Your Shirt In, and then the very cool Down Boy. These songs are quite good...your starting to think that maybe the album will work and was worth buying, but from the moment the horrible chords for City Ain't Big Enough begin, you realise the mistake you made.The following tracks are typical, cheap, British pop...the kind you'd find in the reject pile of Britney Spears' earlier work.I was dissapointed by the lack of substance this album had, and am hoping Holly's next album is much better."
2,Dull And Duller,"Unlike some former reviewers, I have no trouble with pop, or British pop. But this pop is just .... boring. It's not catchy (aside from down boy), her voice sounds as manufactured/altered as the worst of the pop, and after awhile of trying to listen I actually felt physical pain at the dullness of the lyrics, music, and limited vocal range.The most well done part of this CD is the cover. I'm sure it will cause more than a few sales bells to chimes."
2,"Decent singing, dreary songwriting and production.","When you look like Holly Valance, you can't be blamed for using your looks to sell records. Unfortunately, despite having a pretty decent voice, Valance has produced a record that sounds like it was written by a drum programmer who started trying to write songs four weeks ago.Loops, loops and more loops -- that's the modus operandi of this record. With no sense of build to any of the songs, and not a single memorable lyrical or melodic hook, the songs off Footprints are just drum patterns married to basslines, with vocals that always seem to stay within a three-note range, repeating unmemorable ""melodies"" that get boring by the third time they repeat. Choruses repeat without build, drama or passion, and the lyrics are plainly embarrassing.Valance needs to find some real musicians to collaborate with."
4,WTC with feeling,"I share the views of the first reviewer. There is something rich and beautiful about the sound of Korevaar's piano, and the sound of the recording is very natural. He plays this set (and WTC I) with a combination of passion and discipline that is very musical and certainly brings the listener an appreciation of the complexity and extraordinary beauty of the music."
2,"nice, when it works","my boss got one of these as a chrismtas present and keeps it in the office, and it works great! obviously it doesnt produce super awesome amazing sound, but it sounds just fine for one room. so i bought one of these at target, on sale for 50 bucks. brought it home and it did not work at all. no power. so i had to bring it back and decided to try again. bought another one, and it worked! well, kinda. once i put the ipod in the dock, i could not do anything with the ipod. if it was playing a song, then it would play through the speakers, but once it ended the ipod would pause and not do anything. i was quite disappointed, and decided not to bother trying again."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"90 DAYS WARRANTY INSTEAD OF A 1 YEAR WARRANTY FOR A NEW ITEM - BIG WASTE OF MONEYTHIS PIECE OF JUNK DIED AFTER 9 MONTHS OF NORMAL USE. MEMOREX KNOWS THAT ELECTRONICALLY, IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK. THAT IS WHY THERE IS A 90 DAY WARRANTY ON IT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,Good Stuff,"Product really helped me gain muscle fast. I started drinking these just after work outs when i started doing the insanity dvds. I lost 5 inches off my waist and gained 8lbs of muscle in just under 2 weeks. I have gained a lot of muscle size and tone. I would not advise taking it the recommended 3 times a day, at that quantity it made me feel really bloated and actually made it harder to work out. I use it just as a recovery drink.The taste is okay i ordered the strawberries and cream. It is a bit chalky when mixed with water, but i don't want the high calorie count that it has when mixed with milk. Overall I am very happy with this product and have suggested it to a few friends even. I will be ordering more and trying other flavors. Only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is due to the chalky texture and the flavor could be better like the muscle milk strawberry shake."
1,Tastes horrible,"Very bitter taste, I couldn't finish more than a few sips. Maybe if you mixed it with something it'd be better, but I don't really care to since there are better flavors (Chocolate Malt, Chocolate Mint, Banana is okay.)"
5,A manual written especially for political activists,"Writing Dissent: Taking Radical ideas From The Margins To The Mainstream by Robert Jensen (Associate Professor, School of Journalism, University of Texas - Austin) is a manual written especially for political activists with radical ideas, who often find themselves excluded from mainstream news and media. Tips, tricks, and techniques for getting one's message out in the public, drawing from the author's experience as a journalist, activist, and academic. Sample, passionately charged pieces of opinionated political writing along with the author's wisdom and travails attempting to get them distributed pepper Writing Dissent as real-life examples, and the more general advice on journalistic style and how to make one's message as clear as possible resonate powerfully. A ""must-read"" for concerned citizens, activists, and journalists alike."
1,Piano wrapped in cotton mattresses,"The pianist wore boxing gloves. The performance is flaccid, yet absurd."
1,"Some helpful information, but too much ""far out""","This author seems very sincere in her very unconventional beliefs. She shares some good information on viruses and environmental pollution, but she loses credibility as she talks about extraterrestrials who are poisoning our bodies with Plutonium. The helpful information in this book can also be found in many other books that deal with CFIDS and other immune dysfunction illnesses. This book is published by the author."
2,Disappointing for Avid Fans :-(,"My five year old son finished this ENTIRE game in one day! We have nearly all of the I Spy books and all but one of the I Spy software titles, so my son was expecting a greater challenge with this new software. When the game ended--and he told me he had beat ALL of it without my help--I thought he just clicked the wrong button or something. But, yep, he finished it! This would be a good choice for someone who wants to 'sample' the I Spy software, but for the avid fan, this is going to be a big disappointment. This series is SO popular with my son's age group, it's unfortunate that Wick and Marzollo are not creating new photos instead of rehashing the old ones. New clues are okay, but I think I've memorized all of these pictures!"
1,Mom of I spy fans,"This is not as good as the other I Spy games. It does not let you return at harder levels as I Spy Fantasy and I Spy Treasure Hunt do. It uses many of the same pictures as the other games.However, the searching for clues to solve the mysteries is fun."
3,Disappointed in I Spy Mystery,"My afterschool kids and I all love the I SPY computer games but were disappointed in I SPY MYSTERY because it is made up of puzzles that are in all of the other I SPY games. There was nothing new. Also, the game cost $19.99 plus shipping and I was disappointed to see it the following week in Target for $9.99. The overall layout of the game as far as them being separated into ""files"" was fun but we just wish the puzzles had been new."
2,If you own other I Spy Games skip this one,"I just got this I Spy Game and it's the same puzzles and same pictures as one of the other I spy games. If you pay the money, they should give you a completely new game! It's a rip off!"
5,I Spy Mystery Fun,"I bought this game for my 5 1/2 yr old daughter and myself to play together. We both enjoyed it a lot. I like the fact that it can read and re-read outloud the clues names as my daughter is just learning to read. I can leave her playing while I work on dinner and I don't hear ""Mommy, I need you."""
1,I Spy mystery,"Was sold for a mac user, the software cannot run on my mac.The company does is not providing a phone number, all inquiries must be done through emails, which is very inconvenient."
5,I'M LOVING IT,"HAVE BEEN A FAN OF I SPY SINCE I FIRST PICKED UP ONE OF THE BOOKS IN TOYS-R-US 20 SOMETHING YEARS AGO. RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS , I FOUND I SPY FOR THE WII WHILE OUT SHOPPING. MY SISTER REALLY ENJOYED IT, SHE DOES NOT HAVE A WII AND BEGAN LOOKING FOR ANY I-SPY GAMES FOR THE COMPUTER. SHE BOUGHT SOME AND I BOUGHT SOME. THEY SAY FOR CHILDREN, BUT THIS ADULT AND MY ADULT SISTER ARE HAVING A BALL. THANKS"
3,A little too easy,This game should be rated for younger ages than 6-10 because it is much easier than many we have played. There needs to be SOME challenge to make it fun!
1,Totally reused old games.,All the old games were simply regurgitated into this one. All the puzzles are the same. What a waste of money. I've already played this game in essence. Buy this one only or play all the other games and skip this one.
3,bad shipping experience,"The item was shipped via CEVA. Like many reviewers on this site, I had a bad experience with this shipping company. The package arrived crushed and broken. The mounting kit is missing. I had to contact the manufacture to to get the kit."
3,Actually 3 and a half..,"This is a pretty decent album. Nothing too overly original, but its special in its own right. Not alot of bands can harness the energy and sincerity that The Movielife display with this great collection of emotional songs. My two favourites are ""Kelly"" and ""Its Something"" but all of them are pretty great. If you want a high-energy emo outing, check this out."
4,Ryan,"Good cd. Not their best but better than other stuff. More harder and heavier sound which is great but some of it sounds somewhat monotonous at times. Best tracks are face or kneecaps, kelly song, jamestown, hey, ship to shore. They do somewhat expand their horizons in a good way on this one but This Time Next Year is their best in my mind. Still an awesome band."
4,A bargain,"Though these don't last too long, they are cheap and do the job required. I would recommend them to other woodworkers though with heavy usage, they don't last long, but if you purchase a large eraser you can prolong their life--so buy several boxes like I do."
5,Working in Groups,Great survey of theory and practice for classroom use or for learning to be a better group leader or member.
4,OK but trendy and shallow,"Good for a basic understanding and easy to read but tends to emphasize research and science less, and trendy, faddish aspecdts of group dynamics more. Still pretty well balanced overall though their choices in what to cover are sometimes odd, with important but not trendy issues dropped in favor of current fashion and popular jargon / instruments."
5,Blaze Did it again!,"He did his thang and stuck to his dead man concept like on ""Another G..."" Some real good trax on here. I like ""One Less G..."" more but still recommend this.[...]"
4,The Dead Man Lives...,"Blaze returns with ""Colton Grundy"" and brings gangsta back t0 psych0pathic. My favs. s0ngs are...the wh0le CD.Grundy is n0t as g00d as 1 less g in the h00d, but it is w0rth the m0ney.0h and be 0n the l00k 0ut f0r M0n0xide Childs cd ""F0r Sm0kers 0nly the M0n0xide Pr0ject"" Nov. 16th.MMFCL"
1,Quite Sad!,"I was hoping that It wouldn't come to this but after listening to this CD from beginning to end I must say that this is by far the worst Blaze Ya Dead Homie CD to ever circulate through my eardrums. With the exception of about three songs I found this album to be an ideal way to put someone to sleep. The beats are absolutely horrible and don't help the lyrics out at all. Judging by the sound and all around content of this album I'd venture to say that Blaze certainly did not put his all into this at all. If you want to listen to GOOD Blaze, Just get ahold of his LP."
1,ROTEN,"This is by far one sure fire way to ditiguish your self away from the culture you were born as. i recently found this cd for a friend who wanted it. after hearing it and looking up who this dead guy was i found he is actualy white! he claims to be a dead ""g"" from the 90's era of black gang rap but falls just short. instead of being hard core he ends up just sounding hard up, for talent that is. come on white guys rolln round tha hood shootn shotgunz, wtf?as far a music goes this cd seems to have all the ingredients of a beat machine. i guess he (blaze) doesnt actualy play an instument. i guess that this is why you dont see these people on tv or hear them on the radio or even in other peoples cars for that matter.if one word would describe this cd it would have to be ""ignorant."""
2,Unfortunate,"Among several other writings by Muslim women about the religion and its sacred sources, this one also is written by someone who, to my knowledge, does not have training in Arabic language. Feminist re-readings of the Qur'an, hadith, and fiqh works are best done by people who can read the originals. Anyone can put forth fresh interpretations, and even limit those to available English translated materials, but they will never carry the weight needed for influence over a wide variety of the world's Muslims. The writing style is cumbersome and not friendly for students' uses."
2,Not that great,"She is coming from a biased perspective of the history of the relationships between women and men. The perspective that women have always been oppressed through out history. The way she regards hadiths is that she rejects most of them and even critizes the narrators to be sexist. She also criticizes the four Imams ie. Shafii, instead of being more balanced in her writing about the contributions of these four Imams.There are indeed diverse interpretations within the views of Islamic scholars, both women and men, however, as human beings we can embrace them or if we do not agree with them, at least respect them and share our perspectives without degrading them."
2,It fails the common sense test.,"I read this book and learnt a lot about the apologists arguments of the status of women in Islam. As I worked my way through the fairly 'dense' arguments, I kept wondering why are the women in Afghanistan condemned to be locked behind the blue 'Burqas', why do the women in Saudi Arabia need permission from a male to even travel, why are there hardly any women visible in any middle eastern city, and unfortunately I found not even an attempt at answering why have the women been oppressed in Muslim countries for the last millenia. So if you are willing to suspend your belief and go through how ""real"" Islam ""can"" be interpreted personally by a muslim woman who has been living in the US for the last 20 odd years, this book is for you."
5,Jordan fans will enjoy this set.,"Purchased this from Newbury Comics and it was fulfilled by Amazon. The item arrived quickly and was in new condition, as advertised.I bought this for my brother, who is a major Jordan fan, and he loved this DVD set. It includes 5 full-length memorable games (minus the commercials). I was watching along, and it felt just like watching the games back in the day. Full of excitement and tension.The quality of the footage is really good, considering most of this is television footage that was originally shot on videotape and in the 4:3 format. They must have remastered the footage or something, because we watched it on a large-screen HDTV, and it looked great.Hope that helps."
5,Its a must have ...,"If u miss the players and games of the old, u must grab this. The FLU.... Need I say more. Buy it u will not be disappointed!"
3,Foods stick easily,I expected better from Cuisinart. I haven't used it much because it seems to stick easily. I toasted some croutons in it on Xmas Day and the olive oil just burned/stuck on the bottom. I soaked it for a day and still had to use an SOS pad to clean it. It's a bear to use. Attractive looking. I bought it because I need a light pan because I have bad arthritis in my hands and wrist; I thought this would be easy to use & from that standpoint it works well.
1,Very bad quality,"I bought this item about 6 months ago, and have only used it few times. It has many spots that looks like rusty. I tried washing it really well , but it seems it's actually rusted. I expected a much better product from this brand, but the quality of cuisinart is downgrading."
4,Pretty Decent,"This was the 16th & 17th piece added to my growing Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless set of cookware.The first time it was used was to make a double recipe of Tapioca. After adding the 5 1/2 cups of milk, I could see that I was going to be stirring contantly ""up close to the edge"" so I transferred the mixture to my 3 qt sauce pan.I'm sure the saucier will be very useful in the future, but at the time I was stirring the Tapioca, I wished the overall dimension across the top was 1/2"" - 3/4"" narrower - making the height of the pan taller. 5 stars, otherwise."
2,Not what I was expecting from Cuisinart!,"First of all--I cook a lot. I also own a Lot of Cuisinart pans in this Classic line. I was expecting something of the same quality. I ordered this pot to help fill the gap in sizes. I have three other 3 and 4 qt pots and use them all the time. This pan let me down so much! First of all--as another reviewer commented--it tips. I was not expecting this. The handle seems to be heavier than the pot! It is so thin... it took 25 minutes to boil water for macaroni. In all of my other cuisinart pots it takes maybe 5, 8 if I start from really cold water. Yes, I know how to use stainless... yes, I know how to use proper heat for the diameter of the pan--this thing is just well--crap. I hate giving this review because I ADORE Cuisinart pans... but you let me down on the quality here. I will have to keep this pot in the back of the stack. Maybe the husband can find a use when he makes sauce for smoking or something... but then again--it tips!"
1,Does not work on induction cooktop.,Amazon should include the fact that this does not work on induction cooktops in their description. So I will give it the lowest rateing.
4,Overall: Great pan for the price,"This is a great pan for the price: it's an excellent low-cost alternative and does a good job of quickly coming up to temp and providing even heat distribution. I find the capacity is just right and it's not excessively heavy when full. It's not as high quality as All Clad but it's also much cheaper, so keep that in mind. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
5,Favorite cooking vessel,"We decided to buy this one when we switched out from non-stick cookware due to concerns about flakes in the food, and about recycling. And we love it! This is the one we pull out all the time. It's the perfect size for a small family, and uses heat evry efficiently (we never need to use a heat-setting above a medium to fry things). Now I'm planning to get more items from this range."
2,Disappointed about the quality,"The heading says it all...maybe I should not expect a pan in this price range to be of better quality... but I do, especially with the Cuisinart brand....I have seen entire stainless steel pan sets of apparently similar quality for about the same price..... Time will tell if the SS wears too thin over the next few months...."
3,It's OK for the Price,"This is by no means a professional quality chef's pan. It is light weight with a good balance and a relatively heavy bottom. It's a great looking pan with a good lid, although not quite as tight fitting as I would like (but there are workarounds). I purchased the pan to replace a hard anodized Calphalon that was lost in a move; I wasn't ready to spend $100+ on a better pan. So I went into this purchase with my eyes wide open.I would not recommend this pan for beginner cooks, as cooking with it requires careful attention to heat regulation. The pan is pretty adept at stir frying for one or two people and for making quick soups. I wouldn't trust it for rice, but that's just my personal preference. The bottom line is this is a cheap utility pan that will get used for a few specific tasks, but it will not replace a professional quality chef's pan. Not by any stretch of the imagination, regardless of what other reviewers might say."
3,product fan,"I was happy with my purchase, it was a good price and I am always happy with the quality of this brand; this item does have some minor blemishes on the inside bottom of the pot, if these items are seconds the ad should say so, but it works well,so they are only cosmetic."
5,great pan,"Been using almost a year.....it's hanging up on a pan hang rack and I grab it all the time.....have lots of all clad,but this pan is so easy....to hold, to cook with and to clean afterwards!looks the same as when it came: shiny and gorgeous."
5,great book!,This is just what I was looking for in finding classroom activities..As a substitute I like to find creative ways to present material rather than just lecture. It has fun ideas to keep teacher and students involved.
5,Great Graphic Novel!,Terry Moore is the mistress of the graphic novel. Her 'Strangers in Paradise' is brilliant and compelling story of individuals and their relationships with one another. As an artist she is in the top ranks of her field! Bravo and please keep up the excellent work.
4,Indie flick fun,"Had a nice plot to it, was certainly some indie fun there in a sense with the foul language even though it was kind of long"
1,Don't waste your money,"One of the worst movies I have ever fasy forwarded through. Horrible acting, bad story actually so bad it was pathetic. Go do your laundry instead. More fun."
2,Useful Companion if You Own Patterns,"Just a quick note to let potential buyers know that this book was apparently published as a companion for the Stretch and Sew Children's patterns and would be invaluable if you own them, but is not very helpful if you don't."
3,Scientist as novelist,"Scientists don't necessarily make good novelists; Ian Stewart's Flatterland is a case in point. Dan Lloyd has a wicked sense of humor, however, and captures his protagonist, a sardonic philosophy graduate student, perfectly. I'm less enthusiastic about the so-called theory of consciousness the novel is supposed to set forth, which attempts to merge brain scans with Husserl. And readers should be forewarned that a working knowledge of neural networks and multi-dimensional scaling is very helpful."
1,Not really a novel,"As one writer put it, this would be a good book to assign as part of an introduction to neuroscience, or as a text in a philosphy course. It does not really work as a novel. Everyone is just too overwrought over nothing. These are pretty abstract ideas to become this hysterical about."
3,pointy tips,"The leather is very nice, the shoes seem well built, but the pictures on the website are not entirely representative. In fact, these shoes look more like texan boots (pointy tips) when worn. Not a classy mixture, if you ask me."
3,good looks but limited comfort,"This shoe is very very sharp to look at, and looks good when worn. Unfortunately I found they lacked any ""shock-absorber"" on the sole. I walked about 3 or 4 blocks to the grocery store and back and it felt a lot like I was walking in my bare feet so that when walking over even a piece of plastic or a pebble on the sidewalk, it HURT! I'm hoping that adding a pair of insoles will help. The shoe fits a bit larger than some brands."
4,Cute movie but different than trailer,"I first saw previews for this movie through a trailer on a different movie I had bought. It looked exciting; a kid who goes to a spy school. However, the movie is not like the trailer. The school is not a spy school and I don't know why the movie is titled so. I did enjoy the flick but would caution others to not expect it to be like the trailer or name of the movie."
1,Don't Waste your time or Money!!!!!!!!,"As stated in the othe review, this movie is really awful! I was excited about the movie due to the wonderful actors playing in it, but I was EXTREMELY dissapointed in their performances and the TERRIBLE storyline! If you really want to see this movie rent it, please DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. You'll regret spending the money(like me) if you do! On another note, the title is very misleading, this has NOTHING to do with a school of spys! Sorry if your dissapointed, but I wished someone had written this review before I purchased Spy School!!!!!!!"
3,My kids watched it,"I don't think I watched it, since I was at work when they viewed it. I didn't hear any comments, good or bad, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt."
1,WhAAAA?!?,"At the end of this movie i said wow these drugs made this movie awful, then i realized i didnt take drugs and this movie was just a disgrace to mankind. About 3 quarters of the way through the movie Thomas put a stupid phone in the weird bad guys pocket, and i was desperately waiting for the phone to come into play. It didnt. THis movie is a disgrace to america and will probably spark some sort of middle eastern conflict due to its horribleness. Never buy this movie unless you want to feel really bad about yourself. The plot was awful, they wrote is so poorly, and there are so many unanswered questions. The secret service needs to get its priorities straight and protect the presidents daghuter and not a stupid kid that people doubt. My last concern is to why DL Hugely was even considering taking the role of the secret servie agent. I know hes a no talent actor but he could to a little better.P.S. If you want a actual movie, watch one with an ape in it, like ED or dunsten checks in"
1,Nothing without Anthrax,I bought this POS thinking it would be like Anthrax. What I got was a horribly produced recording by 2nd rate musicians.
1,An Outdated Schmaltzy Film,"So many people seem to like this film - Madame X. I don't. I 've seenit on television and am glad I never saw it in a theater in 1966.The cast is excellent (Lana Turner, John Forsythe, Burgess Meredith,Ricardo Montalban, Joan Whats-Her-Name)but the plot and the schmaltzydialogue plus the tear-jerking conclusion leave me laughing and that's it.Why was this movie made ? And as late as 1966. This is a 1940'-50's film,in my opinion, and outdated by the Sixties. But so many people seem to likeit. Sentimentality. Sob, sob, sob......You can have Madame X. This should have been made as a farce...."
2,"Depressingly, haunting","From the beginning when they showed the huge mansion, I thought it would be tough to make a good movie with rich people. And in this case this assumption proved correct. The life of the rich who are politically connected is really depressing if this movie is true. I found it annoying although, seeing Rocky's future trainer was the only interesting part of the movie. Big thumbs down on this downer."
5,This is one of the best movies of all times,How this video has not made it to DVD is a mystery to me. Lana Turner shines like she never has before in this depiction of Holly Anderson.I really hope that the movie distributers will look at this and put it on DVD ; as I know it will sell like hotcakes. I mean look at the VHS price 29.90 and up.!!
5,Response to Yeah Pretty Much,"I have been desparately trying to purchase a DVD of Lana Turner's Madame X - when is this going to happen! Its a fabulous film on a par with Now Voyager - two of the greatest weepies of all times, and Brief Encounter too of course.Where is the DVD? A film not to be missed!"
5,Tear Jerker Extraordinaire,"This one'll tug at your heart strings (if you have a heart). Ricardo Montalban gives a pretty good (though short) performance as well as John Forsythe, Constance Bennett and of course the glamorous and delightful (though decidedly un-so in this film) Miss Turner. Oh and let's not forget Burgess Meredith (viscious)!If you like this film you'll also enjoy ""Waterloo Bridge"" with Janet Leigh and Robert Taylor."
5,Excellent!,Thanks for the fast service and excellent condition of the video! They don't make movies like this anymore. Thanks for having it available!
3,Disappointment,Although this is a fantastic selection of original boleros by Los Panchos the sound quality of some of the tracks is very inferior with audible hiss and surfaces noise on some of the tracks . I guess the sound sourcing is vinyl. Industria argentina will have to work very hard indeed to catch up with the quality of CDs offered by US and UK labels.
2,Bulky and mostly useless,"I know that's a very sweeping subject title but I am afraid its very relevant from the perspective of the average traveler who will pick this book up. The maps are horribly designed. Often you need to go back and forth to make sense. In the end, I just had to print out Google maps to actually get about the city. Too much information and little organization. Probably not written for the tourist but rather for the resident of the city."
2,Just okay for seeing San Francisco,"Pretty salty and hip but I kept having to look at my big map to figure out how to get to the places it was referring to. If I have to comment on a major fault, it is with the directions. It doesn't stand alone as the only guidebook to maneuver you through San Francisco streets. Luckilyl I met many friendly locals who helped point me in the right direction. It's a fine city and has a splendid old park to stroll."
1,Don't waste your time on this travel guide.,"I have been to San Francisco before but this time is for my Honeymoon, I wanted to make the trip special. I did not like this travel guide. There were no color glossy pictures, only a few hotels were listed for each area of the city. In the past I have bought Fodor's and Michelin travel guides that were much better."
5,Fearless,Jet Li's greatest achievement in making a hero a real down to earth person. Fight scenes unbelievable!!! A must see!!!!
4,Super cute,"I like it, the bows come out super cute and the chocolate sets in a matter of minutes! Can't wait to use these for Minnie Mouse bows on cookies and cupcakes!"
1,Bad shipping rates,Hi i was really interested in the westin step side for my truck.But when i saw the shippers shipping rate of 250.00 i feel off my seat.#1 I know for a fact the step sides are not more then 20lbs for one so you would think 40lbs plus maybe 10 lbs for matt. Sorry no way am i paying 250 for shipping and i`m shore most of the people out their shopping will not pay that either thanks anyway.Bruce
4,I'm Odd So This Is Something I Can Get Into,"Odd, yes! Cheesy, yes! As someone who should have been kickin' around in the '30's and '40's when Florida was a veritable rat trap of tourist attractions, this book is about as good as it gets. I live in FL part time and when I am here I will go way out of my way to check out anything that might be called weird, oddball, or tacky. Give me a ice cream cone stand that looks like a jumbo soft serve cone, a faux pirate ship that used to have bingo nights, or the world's largest orange and I am happy. It's all in this crazy, fun guide. The joys of cruisin' the Tamiami Trail for the ultimate oddities or hitting the Irlo Bronson Hwy in Kissimee for too much strangeness for a couple miles or Wikiwatchee----the home of the live mermaids. You can use this fun guide to immerse yourself in oddball stuff as you crisscross the state. Great for the real deal traveler or the armchair variety tourista."
4,Oddball Florida,"We as snowbirds travel to florida each winter, this books is full of info of places we visited that now after reading it, we must revisit some of those places. ""Great Book full of info""DWS"
4,Awesome but not easy to get information,"First things first. The images are spectacular! The music is better! But no narration? I know we all complained about the Stargaze I narration being bland (me included), but damn! What a major pain in the a** to flip back and fourth in the menu to get information on the image being shown. The text is great, but they could of gotten Patrick Stewart to do it or someone that does not put you to sleep. I like to hear about I'm seeing. Even that being said the pics are worth 4 stars. Those 3D images are kind of silly, but acceptable. We need stargaze III with narration please. GO HUBBLE!!! Go to www.space.com !"
3,Could've been AWESOME,"First things first. I love the Hubble Telescope images (that's why I got the DVD). The music is fantastic too, so good that some days I let it play in the background when I'm working. However, there are no menu controls for the DVD to cycle, so even though it does cycle, first it spills back into the main screen showing all the choices. Too bad, because I got this as wallpaper for my big screen and a living painting while working with my patients and consulting clients, and I don't want or need to keep seeing the main screen with choices, and neither do they. I consider this a significant shortcoming, and had I known it worked this way, I would likely not have ordered this DVD. Oh well. Again, the images are (mostly) beautiful (except for the hokey collages) and the music is lovely."
5,AWE Wow!!!,Prepare to be in true awe and feel the inspiration of the images on your soul. I see so many organic features in these videos. Gas clouds that look like veins or stars in such clusters as to mystify the mind. I enjoy this video year after year one nights when I want the big screen to show more than TV stuff. It makes a great background video to leave on all night when reading and cleaning.
3,Hubble Slide Show,"I have always loved seeing the pictures that come from Hubble, so I knew at least I would get that out of this video....and that's what I got... The Least.This video is about an hour long and is nothing more than slides of Hubble's photographs overlapped with some music and the occasional weird photoshop cutout moving across the screen. Some of the cutouts were so bad you could see the edges from whatever picture they took it from.Some truly great images from Hubble however the presentation just didn't quite make the cut. Some narration of the images would have been helpful, but in the end I was unsatisfied with the overall production. I would suggest getting this from netflix or the library before committing to buying it.3 Stars based on Hubble's photography alone, since there is little else.For more on me and my work:The Master Within"
2,Stargaze II ... Just another poor sequel,"I really enjoy Stargaze and was anxious to order and watch the second installment with Stargaze II. Unfortunately, like most sequels, second parts, etc., Stargaze II falls significantly short of expanding on the photographic essay that Stargaze did; and in this respect, was a miserable disappointment.There is so much that the Hubble ST has given to us in the way of images, I find it hard to believe that there was a shortage of images that could be incorporated into this DVD. The overlay of images over a moving starfield in the first chapter should never have been allowed. It's a shame. Often times presentations like this are the inspiration and trigger for those who wonder if a life in astronomy might be their calling."
2,"good concept, terrible execution","Have you ever looked at hubble deep space posters orfotos on their own website ? Tell me, do you stareat it in awe, or do you move away from it within fewshort seconds ?If your attention span is short, and you DONT carefor resolution or detail, then waste your money bydonating to the producers of this dvd. Constantpanning and movement never lets you view anytyhingunless you hit PAUSE on your dvd player to evenbegin to appreciate anything on this disk.Too short, too hasty and very unprofessionally done,as if by high school students.good night,k"
4,original and compelling,I have been waiting for years now for another novel from this author!I really enjoyed her subtle and slightly obscured story telling.I have read this several times and even tried some of the recipes.
4,Mobstyle Music...,"When I first heard the samples of this CD on ... I wasn't feelin it to much...But Buk was hella cool and hooked me up with a copy and I must say after listening to the CD as a whole I really like it...I highyl sugest yall take a lil bit of ya skrill and buy this album...Also be on the lookout for tha new Bukshot album intitled ""They Still Don't Love Me"" dropin late August..."
3,Engine,"Vroom! Vroom! My engine starts. I feel my tires screech out of the driveway and onto the highway. I see the open road ahead and ""push the pedal to the metal."" With police on my tail, I do a u-turn at 100 mph!I turn out of control like a daredevil. Man, look out! I slam into a police car and get a bruise. My driver feels like he's sitting on top of the world! My lights are slammed to the point they don' t work any more. My number is America and I bump the other cars off the road.Aaaah! Crash! I feel heat! Fire! I explode! My driver is taken to the hospital! Some words rhyme and others don't!Six months later I'm going to get a new owner. But no. It is the same one. Oh well, maybe he has learned a lesson. My fellow cars will be amazed. I am magnificent car! I am outstanding car! I have Fame!Yes!"
1,BNW Industries,This product does not work for metal applications. The backing is very weak and shreads apart with ease. In fact its easier to tear with your own fingers than it is cardboard.
5,large sanding disks,"I have used many different brands of large sanding disks on my large disk sanding and to be quite honest, I haven't found that one is significantly better than any other. The Woodstock D1336 works as well as any others. The price was good and it was on Prime so I bought it."
1,Yikes,"This book does NOT have it all. Particularly not on ""every"" aspect of harmonica. The ""700+ articles"" are on average 1-2 sentences of general knowledge (rarely useful). I love the harp and do NOT love this book. I can ""live"" just fine without it and it is NOT ""the best harmonica book ever written"". Almost every other harmonica book here on amazon is better. The other reviews here are insane. (and/or by the author?)"
1,"The item never arrived, and emails to Mowtownusa went unanswered.","The item never arrived, and emails to Mowtownusa went unanswered. Amazon canceled my order after a month of waiting"
5,One of my favorites!,"I couldn't find this for the longest time because I couldn't remember the exact title. SO glad I finally found it, but WHY IS IT OUT OF PRINT?????? My favorites from childhood are the Frances books and this one. Now I have ordered a used copy for my daughter."
3,"Some stories great, some not so well done.","Life on the Mississippi is done wonderfully.The Jumping Frog of Calveras County is donewith such an affected ""old codger"" accent thatit's not funny at all, which is almost impossiblefor that story. Everything else spans therange.The CD is a compilation of several actors,which doubtless explains the variability."
2,The audio was not a good quality,I tried several different audio devices and all produced the same low quality audio -- so it must have been the CD.
3,Great Support,The only reason I did not give this a higher score is that one (out of 3 I have purchased) split open on a seam. The support is good and it is comfortable to wear all day.
3,It ok,It's OK. it fits well but not very comfortable. It seems too thick.But it's better than nothing and I can hold it for a while
5,Murder and mayhem,"As it has been a while since I've read Macbeth I'm glad that I read this edition. It was compact but easy to read. The material at the beginning of the book was excellent and helped put the play in context. And of course, as one of Shakespeare's works this is not just one of the most well-known but one of the easiest reads as well. Tragic, but worth reading."
3,Pleasant background music,"Music selection reminiscent of Nordstroms department store background music when their piano player is off for the day. Put this disc on and pretend you're shopping for Ferragammo and Vera Wang. OK, it's fine for when you have new people over for wine, cheese and conversation. Rating: Content *** audio quality *** 1/2"
3,Description,"She was afraid she'd never become a woman.After her desperately unhappy marriage to Barry, the last thing Vicki Peters wanted was another involvement. Being an unloved widow was better than risking her heart again.But almost against her will, she found herself married to Garth Travis. Vicki was convinced she had done it mostly for the sake of Garth's little son.Then she discovered two things: that she was madly in love with Garth--and that he was no better than Barry had been...."
3,Good information but not organized well,"This book has a lot of good information especially to those new to this subject, but the organization of the book is all over the place.The author mixes too much new age with science with mythology sometimes in the wrong places which makes the book very hard to take. I would have liked this book more if the author stuck less with the new age and went more with the link between science and mythology.If one is a beginner in this subject, I'd rather recommend Fingerprints of the Gods by Ghrahm Hancock. Hancock's book is much more consice and does a great job in linking science and mythology with emerging new theories.Lost Star is a little too much New age for me."
1,All 6 Billions?,"I may very well be wrong, but the impression I have come away with reading this book is that: If we all sit tight on our butts, humanity as a whole will ascend to the next height of our civilization on autopilot. As our twin star approaches ours in the endless cosmic dance, the sky will open and everything will take care of itself. Happy times are here again...I respectfully disgaree with the author on this sanguine collective outlook. Our souls have different origins. We entered this planetary realm with varying levels of spiritual awareness. Should we expect the next stage of soul evolution be identical for all of humanity? All 6 BILLIONS of us?PMS Yuga3rd day of descending menstral cycle"
3,"Average. This book was OK, but I wouldn't read it twice.","Lost Star of Myth and Timepresents the interesting hypothesis that we live in a binary system. Furthermore, it attributes the cycle of ages to our sun's mystery companion. I find this theory interesting and wouldn't mind reading a bit more about it. This book is a bit repetitive, so I found it easier to read other books, coming back and reading bits of this in between. Despite this, there are certainly some interesting historical tit-bits and interesting takes on local folklore. Perhaps a book to flip through rather than reading cover-to-cover."
5,Present a awsome idea!!,The author's idea of earth being part of a binary star system is interesting. When you look at the number of binary system's in our galaxy it would seem that they are the norm. Therefor I dont see anything wrong with his theory of a brown dwarf or something of the sort with a long eliptical orbit. This match's very well with alot of Hindu science and religion. Many of the idea about Yuga's that Cruttenden presents are also stated in The Holy Science. This book is well researched IMO and make's sense to me.
4,Magnificent Seven Soundtrack,I love the music from this movie. The only difficulty I had was when trying to play this CD on my computer. The initial CD did not even play so I returned it and got another one. The second one played but had poor sound quality.
5,Still Magnificent,"I have waited a long time for ""The Magnificent Seven"" soundtrack to be available. It was well worth the wait. What a fantastic score! Makes me want to see the movie again. This version claims to be the actual soundtrack and it sounds like it to me. Good sound quality. I recommend it heartily. Just don't play it while driving. :)"
3,ear piece hurts,the head phones are great when it comes to sound but for some reason i dont feel confortable while wearing it.. it hurts my ear.
3,SRF-M97 is ok,"I wanted to get a mini FM radio so I could listen to a number of NPR radio shows on the weekends and still get something done around the yard, etc. After researching and reading reviews I guessed that the Sony Radio Walkman would do the trick. Unfortunately, the two stations that I normally listen to fade in and out constantly no matter what I do. The NPR station is only a mile from my house. Other stations come in loud and clear. The programming wasn't difficult after I read the directions. The megabass is good. At first the earbuds were painful, but they're better now. For the price it should receive a station a mile up the street."
4,Works Well,Definitely a small radio with a good signal. It doesn't work well at my gym but I don't think any radio would. My only complaint is the time displays on when it is off. Seems like a waist of battery.
4,5 Years of Ownership and Still Going Strong,"I purchased this new from Amazon in November 2005 for $56.99, and am amused to see that the price has actually increased by 75%.This little beauty is still working just fine to spite the many, many times I've dropped it and whacked it against things. It has easily outlasted several headsets and ear-buds. I would estimate that this unit has given me over 500 hours of service.My only complaint is that I could do with somewhat better reception. (I am in San Gabriel, California, in Los Angeles County.)"
2,constant hiss and mediocre reception,"I purchased the SRF-M97 to use while running in a metropolitan area. However before I even took it outside I noticed that if has a persistent hiss on FM stations and suffered from signal dropout and interferrence. Outside it is worse, especially when it's colder. I have tried different types of batteries, headphones, local/DX settigs. The sad fact is that my old analog micro sized Radio Shack model 12-893 is far supperior to the SRF-M in terms of sound and reception."
2,Right Price?,"I think the price of $148 is off by at least $100. I paid a little over $40 over a year ago. Now the on/off button had malfunctioned and works about once every 200 pushes. I enjoyed it while it worked, as long as I listened to AM, but it was never able to pick up FM stations."
1,Perhaps not appropriate for this purpose,"I purchased this item specifically for use in the gym while doing lengthy step machine excercises. I wanted something to divert my attention away from the long boring workout and thus wanted to be able to tune into a talk show of some sort preferably on an AM band. Unfortunately, in the gym while on the step machine, the radio seems unable to bring in an AM station. It barely brings in a few FM stations. I have kept the item for the limited value it provides me, however, I am not satisfied with its performance in the gym environment. Perhaps with all the mechanical and electrical equipment in a gym, there is not a product appropriate for this use."
4,A really good compact radio,"I got this for my partner who was using a clunky old cassette walkman on his daily power walks - hard to fit in the pocket of gym shorts and a pain to have to carry. This works fine; the fidelity of the earphones could be better, but that's a problem I've found with all earbud type devices. Good price, good performance, and you don't have to be an engineer to program it."
3,bad reception,"I wanted to replace an old aiwa radio because the reception was not no good but this is almost the same, if not worse."
2,"Static, Static, Static",This did not live up to its price or my expectations. I walk to work and there was static on both AM and FM -
1,"An Unexpected, Shockingly Poor Sony Product!","As an owner of two previous high end Sony Walk-FM products,I was looking forward to this highly touted and hard-to-find item.Disappointment and disbelief were my rewards: poor signal-to-noise,poor rejection of neighboring stations, significant multipath deflection,poor general sound quality, poorly functioning ear buds in anattractive, tiny package.Don't even consider the SRF-M97!!!"
4,Great portable radio,"This radio is very light, easy to use and has very good reception. The only problem area I forsee is the belt clip. It could have better gripping ability.Update. This radio still works well after two years. Excellent battery life and great reception. To the people having reception problems try different headphones. I did notice that the new price is $158.33. Well I paid around $50.00, Which is fair, 158.33 is outrageous. This radion is not that good Sony."
4,"Not bad, could have more features for the price","This is a nice little radio but reception in buildings is pretty shoddy. Outdoors, reception for both AM and FM is pretty good. For $60, you'd expect it to have some other features like voice recording to flash memory, or some limited flash MP3 storage (256mb or 512mb) but it lacks those features.This radio's optimal price would be $30, no more. At $60, you're obviously paying for the Sony brand, not the quality."
1,Outdated product in today's age,"Though its a good product, its outdated for today's technology. Also very difficult to tune it to the right station as auto-tune functionality hardly worksMy cellphone FM gives much clear reception and is easier to carry around than this Sony radio. I am planning to sell it online as I am not finding any use of it now. Moreover, the sound quality is not good. The mega bass is not ""mega"" in any sense. The reception has lot of noise. I wonder how my cellphone radio is playing much better than a dedicated FM radio"
5,Great performance in a tiny package.,This is a reasonably new item from Sony and I was impressed with the performace. The AM reception is much better than many larger units; now I can hear Air America all over town from a small local station.
5,Juanita Brown,This CD is FABULOUS!! If you really like good music I highly recommend this one. My husband and I continue to enjoy every song and shared it with all of our friends. We can't wait for the next one.
5,Sherrie does it again!,"As an adult adoptee, I heartily recommend this book to anyone touched by adoption. Sherrie is a master at putting words to feelings- especially from an adoptee's perspective. This book will help many to understand why they react as they do, why they have problems in relationships, and why it is so hard for adoptees to give up control, even to God. You will be touched by the openness of the stories shared in the book, by Sherrie and by the adoptees who contributed. This is not a book about blaming adoption for all our problems, but instead is a book that will lead to hope and healing."
3,Good underlying theme,"I was reluctant to read this book due to the reviews criticizing the religious jargon but was glad I did. The book does have many good underlying messages that touch the core of an adoptees experience and I would recommend it to anyone searching for answers on how adoption plays a key role in developing how we relate to the world. Although I did find the pious God loves you theme a bit annoying and simply skipped over those parts.Sheree's other book ""20 Things Every Adoptee Wishes Their Adoptive Parents Knew"" was even more enlightening, offering some valuable information without trying to ""save"" you."
3,NOT FOR THE NON-RELIGIOUS!!,"This is a great book for adoptees with practical suggestions. If you are not religious however, and you are offended by religious undertones, be aware. Otherwise, Sherrie's insights are honest, gut-wrenching, and VERY helpful for the still-suffering adoptee to read."
4,"Honest, courageous, healing","Sherrie's book comforted me in profound ways.As a birthmother still searching at 57 for my son relinquished at birth, and the adoptive mother of a 26 year old daughter rescued from an orphanage in India, I am stunned by my adoption reading. In my heart and mind scattered pieces of a huge emotional puzzle are being retrieved and put together in a way that makes sense.Sherrie's honesty, courage, and generosity of heart are a profound healing force for anyone effected by adoption. I found it hard to put this book down and I know it will continue to be a source of strength for my whole family."
2,Good concept but way to religious!,"I liked Sherrie's first book much better. This book is good for the religious at heart. But for those who are offended by religious jargon, consider the following healing books.For adoptees: Whose Child? by Kasey HamnerFor Birthmothers: The Other Mother by Carol Schaefer"
4,Important handbook for enhancing adoptees' own sense of self,"This publication, Ms. Eldridge's latest on adoption issues, is an important handbook for enhancing adoptees' own sense of self and certainly promotes greater comprehension of adult adoptees' unique, personal experiences. She has taken our individual ""I thought these particular feelings were mine alone"" mentalities and weaved them into a quilt of shared adoptee experiences. The resulting reward is a greater understanding of adult adoptees by non-adoptees, and most importantly, increasing the understanding of ourselves. Thank you, Sherrie, from the bottom of my adult adoptee heart."
2,Too religious,"While the author had some interesting points and insight, I felt she talked about her spirituality and religious beliefs way too much, which made me not want to read the book. As an adult adoptee I am disappointed as this could have been a great resource"
2,A well meaning yet overtly religious text...,A personal interest in the adoption triad brought me to this well-intentioned book found within the donated books of a local coffee shop. Though there are many informative additions to the genre out there I have as yet to find any one text which speaks to this often very emotional and very political subject with complete and honest detachment.There will be those who will find this effort perfectly suited to their interests and reflective of their experiences.Be aware however of this books wholly subjective stance and it's heavy reliance upon christian religious reference.
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book. I am a adoptee and have read a handful of books on adoption and liked that this dealt not only with the emotions you might encounter when searching for birth parents but the emotions you deal with just growing up adopted. Unfortunately I lost interest after the first 2 or 3 chapters. I would've found the author's voice more endearing if I were reading an online blog but as a book it just doesn't work. Too many chapters include moments like ""here is a poem I wrote about the feelings I had on this subject"" and it began to chaffe after a while. There is also quite a bit of a religious slant that isn't helpful to a non-christian. Overall, not a BAD book per se, just one I could easily put down."
5,The Tour of the Human Body,"This is an excellent read for young students wanting to discover more about the functions of internal organs of the human body. Beshkin writes the story in an informative way but keeps the reader's attention with a humorous, understandable, easy to follow storyline. She also includes a moral about the hazards of teen smoking. The full color illustrations are very well done and entertaining."
3,why pink?,i would buy this jersey in 2 seconds for even 3 times the amount if it weren't for the fact that the jersey is pink and white. the team's colors are orange and black. just because i'm a girl doesn't mean i want my Flyer's jersey to be pink!
5,"Seems to be a quality shirt, arrived on time",The shirt seems to be a slightly heavier weight cotton than most T's. It arrived on time and in good condition. No problems at all.
1,Note - this book does not actually contain plays,"The title is totally misleading. The book contains essays ABOUT plays, not the actual plays themselves. What a waste."
4,when you need a good cry,there are happy tears and sad tears throughout this flick...I really enjoyed this one. but like I titled..you will shed a tear or two
2,NOT a comedy,"I wasn't interested in watching 50/50 when it came out in theaters, but after hearing many people talk about it, I thought ""maybe my gut was wrong."" No, it wasn't. Very much what I knew it was going to be. Decent acting, but it's NOT a comedy. and for this movie to be under ""comedy"" section just cuz the Seth Rogan is in it, is insane. This movie had 2 maybe 3 CHUCKLE worthy moments that, let's face it, EVERY movie has 2-3 of those. We get it.... Cancer... beats it. NOT funny."
2,It was ok,I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a really good movie but I was a bit on the disappointed side. There were some funny parts of the movie but I would not buy or rent it again.
5,Hard to get better,"Some movies are big because of budget, special effects, and or actors.... but 50/50 is a great story with great acting. It delivers an untold side to dealing with disease that people should be aware of."
3,It's always nice to see someone beat the big C,The best parts are that the good guy gets to kick a lyin' cheatin' b???? out along with the big C.
2,All the comedy was given in the previews,Previews made it appear to be a comedy mixed with drama. All the comedy was given to us in the previews. It was a drawn out movie that I was just waiting to end!
4,Great movie,I enjoyed this movie a lot & love Amazon instant video rental. Cheaper than FIOS rentalsGreat plot and storyline
4,"I laughed, I cried...","Great movie. As other reviewers have stated, it has the perfect mix of humor and emotion as well as a few life lessons thrown in for good measure. Life is precious...don't take your relationships (all of them) for granted, laugh A LOT, and eat the pot macaroons if/when offered."
4,"Solid performances, moving story","This film rather surprised me, but it was well acted, written, and surprisingly not unbearably sad to watch. I'm surprised Joseph Gordon-Levitt didn't get any nominations for this role, but he is often rather overlooked, despite always giving good performances. I won't summarize the plot as that has been done very well already, so I'll just say it was well worth seeing."
4,Good Movie,Good movie and great character development. The director does a great job of encapsulating a serious subject with moments of comedy relief and frustration. Well worth the $4 rental price.
4,Loved it,I loved this movie and it's an emotional roller coaster. It also makes you realize that this crap happens to a lot of people and could happen to anyone at anytime.JGL is awesome!
4,Very realistic,"I appreciate this movie from a variety of angles. I like real movies with life lessons. Didnt appreciate the crude language at times though. But overall, very good."
3,misleading trailer,"This was a fairly accurate portrayal of someone dealing with cancer and is not funny or light-hearted at all, though the preview makes it out to be that way. Don't watch this movie unless you want to cry and feel depressed afterward."
2,50/50,"While 50/50 contained a very heartfelt and personal message, the language was rather crude. I was looking for a lighter appeal, and was disappointed. 50/50 did not fail on the entertainment behalf, however because of the language, I can only recommend this film to the highly mature."
3,3.99 lost to the cloud,I have been waiting to view this movie for along time. But I waited to purchase and view it on my new Kindle on a recent long flight home. I downloaded it the day before too the device and tried to watch it but it never worked. Even though it said it downloaded. Just another on a long list of disappointments that is a Kindle Fire. Guess Ill have to wait for Net Flix .
2,50/Nope,"I found this movie to have it's highlights, but other than that - it was quite dull & expected! It isn't bad in any means, just not really entertaining for me.I did however stream this from my Roku from amazon video store, & that worked really well."
2,not even remotely funny,"The blurb on the DVD jacket says comedy. Well, I was expecting Denis Leary's No Cure For Cancer type of laughs since the topic was cancer. There are virtually no laughs in it. It's pretty depressing for much of this movie. The acting is fine and for once two of the supporting actors who usually drive me nuts (Seth Rogan and Dallas Bruce Harper) are tolerable. The problem is the pacing of the story is ponderously slow.Don't believe the hype such as ""consistently, uproariously funny"" on the DVD jacket. This is a B movie at best done by A list actors.There are tons of special features with it but I found myself fast-forwarding parts of the actual movie so, sorry, I just can't sit through all the extras to give anyone out there a better review of the whole DVD package."
1,DEPRESSING!!! Cancer fun!,"This movie is about getting cancer and all the fun that goes with that. For some reason I thought this movie was a going to be a comedy before I went and saw it. Boy, what a mistake. Its uber depressing. Even the attempted jokes have a sharp depressing tone to them (don't want to give away anything so I won't say more).If you like being depressed(I know people who actually like it), watch this flick..."
1,ugh,"Smirking, obscenities, obscenities while smirking, obscenities while not smirking. This film has nothing else to offer, so unless you find smirking and/or obscenities intrinsically humorous don't bother."
5,Not a FUNNY movie,"This isn't a straight funny movie like I expected with Seth Rogan, but it was so well done. Definitely a movie I will rewatch several times"
3,Pretty Good for A Mainstream Movie,"The writer of this film is a cancer survivor himself; so having a friend recently [lose] a battle with cancer, I could really relate the the pain in the movie, but it was told within the superficial confines of mainstream hollywood move formulas. So characters are essentially one dimensional."
5,"50/50 (50% drama, 50% comedy)","I watched this movie in theaters and told myself i'd watch it again in theaters. I did. It was my favorite movie of 2011. So i couldn't wait for it to come out on bluray, but feared it would get a sub-par transfer. My expectations were high, but it did not. I was very pleased with the quality of the bluray. Picture is clear and the opening credits are astoundingly detailed. The scene where all the sound goes out when Adam gets the news about his cancer is very clever and the bass in that scene is extremely deep. I believed that scene was a greatly innovative and it comes off well on bluray, as does the whole movie."
5,genuinely funny,"This is not just a funny movie. There are definately some very dramatic moments--given the plot. If you are looking for funny and dumb, do not watch this movie"
4,Come in Open minded,"50/50 is by no means a bad movie whatsoever. Its just a very particular movie with it's audience. Where Heavy Emotons are balenced with comic relief; and to that very finely balanced. And this is where the movie truly shines Seth Rogan and Joseph Levitt are great on-screen; and have a very believable realationship. Athough, one thing sort of bothered me and that would be the love interest that sprouts later on in the movie; it bothered me in a sense that it never really seemed that it should have taken off or that it's believable. Other than that it was good it didn't surpass or dissappoint my expectations.If you're interested; Give it a rent."
5,real,"As someone who has had and survived cancer in there 20's....was dumped when diagnosed....and found out who really is and will always be there for me and love me, this movie truly hit home. Yes it's a comedy, but I also wept like a baby. This movie is well made, great acting, and brings you through a real roller coaster of emotions. I loved this movie....loved."
1,Not funny at all,"Just another Seth Rogan movie that is full of stupid stunts and not-funny antics. I rented this one and everyone in the room got up and left to do ANYTHING else after the first 30 minutes rather than watch this. It is not funny, it is embarrassing to watch these two actors try to be funny, and they fail miserably. Just horrible. I have now promised my family to never rent another movie with Seth Rogan in it if at all possible. He ruins every movie he is in since he can't act, and he only has one mode - humiliatingly stupid."
3,Not very good,I thought the movie was not very good. They tried to mix comedy with drama and the result was something I could not really enjoy. Kind of when you don't know if you are supposed to laugh or cry. I did not hate it but one watch was definitely enough for me.
1,Not one thing is funny in this film,"This was in NO way a comedy.Advertised as `achingly hilarious' but the only actual ache was waiting, and waiting, and waiting for anything funny to happen.Advertised as `consistently, uproariously funny' but the meager sporadic attempts at humor were ho-hum at best.The whole theme was heartfelt, so should be called a drama NOT a comedy.What a rip off advertisement!!!!Now for the story.The characters behaviors were totally illogical in dealing with terminal cancer. As a drama, the believability factor is a total zero.Watching Seth Rogan waste his excellent acting talent (based on his role in Knocked up) was really sad, too!"
1,Porn,If you like audio porn this video is for you it is the first thing you hear when the movie starts OOOOOOOOO joy
4,People have goodness in them,"Mom going to cancer support group and friend reading how to face cancer together.It has been always there, but suddenly it hits me again about goodness in people, and they are around me."
5,Great movie,I really enjoyed this movie. Sad movie but enjoyable. I bought the digital download and enjoyed it so much. I bought the physical DVD as a gift for someone
