3,Ted,"Just okay, surprised because word of mouth said it was hysterical....it had a few moments. Seth Macfarlane is usually on target."
3,Just OK,"Too much story, not enough funny stuff- pretty simple story line that really goes just how you think it will"
3,Funny?,I really thought that this movie would be hillarious. It was slightly funny at best. The party scene was probably the funniest part of the movie.
2,It was ok...,This movie was just OK. There are some very funny parts but I just didn't care for the lame plot and the love story
3,Kinda boring...,This movie was sorta boring. Cute at times and funny here and there but nothing to write home about. Funny storyline if you think about it but overall just okay for me.
2,Funny...but I think Seth MacFarlane is beginning to over due the juvenile adult bit,"I have always loved Seth's stuff, but lately been waning on the same old schtick. Best buddies for ever... until the hot chick gets in the way... so lets screw it up....then make up"
3,Not as good as it was made out to be.,"The commercials for Ted made it out to be super funny (which is the point of commercials in the first place) and my friends said it was the best movie they'd ever seen. I politely disagree. Though it did have quite a few humorous lines (most of which were already seen in the commercials), the movie itself was more gratting on the nerves than anything. The sappy crap storyline made me want to gag and the plot line was to pradicatable. The sound got messed up in a few places in a way that made it blatenty obvious which was from a recording studio and which was from the scene being filmed. Over all its humor is more for the immature, which is kind of condicending for me to say given that I am fourteen. I laughed, but it still didn't make up for the poor plot line."
2,"Great Movie, Terrible picture quality","Loved the movie somewhat predictable, but the picture quality was aweful, almost bad enough to not watch the movie at times."
3,Bit over the top,"Think it was a bit to harsh, to many F-bombs and the bear wasn't really that likable. Probably more appealing to the teen-age crowd."
3,"Pretty juvenile, but a fun romp.","I am certain that many have gone over all the plot details. I'll not do that. I'll give you my impresions from the movie.I felt the story line wasn't very strong. The teddy bear was more believable than the human characters. I think it would have been better if the characters outside of the ""ted bubble"" were a little more realistic.Yes yes yes, it's a farce by design but it's how I feel. Another sign of this is the Tom Skerritt theme throughout the movie was a highlight for me.There were quite a few laughs but no gut-shaking ones for me.It didn't connect and didn't live up to the hype by quite a bit. Glad I rented it from Amazon rather than seeing it in the theatre.I think it's clear the target market for this movie did not include me and that colors this review. If you are a mid-20's or younger male I'd bet you'll like it a lot more than I did."
5,is that a shit,"funny effin movie, dudes teddy bear is ridiculous. fuzzy nuts. talkin about having a teddybrewzinski kunis is so effin hot too."
5,Hilarious Movie,Rented Ted with wife. Funny movie and streaming was clean and crisp. No problems at all and really good movie.
3,A Fun Diversion,"Rude, crude, and utterly hilarious at times. Give Seth credit for creating something original. I don't know what was funnier: watching a stuffed Teddy bear drive a car while high or listening to Marky Mark speak in his native tongue. You will find yourself guffawing at some of the jokes. Goofy, twisted and fun.....if you like that sort of thing ;)"
3,I kind of liked it.,I thought i was going to be twice as funny! Someone of it was just plan out stupid! I did enjoy some parts wouldn't recommend to people who aren't amused easily.
3,A few out-loud laughs....,"But not as many as I had hoped. Funny, inappropriate humor. I wouldn't recommend watching with your kids. Streamed without any problems."
4,just fun,"This is just a ""put your logic on the shelf"" and laugh movie! Ted is so f'ing cute and Wahlberg ain't bad either."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big Seth MacFarlane fan, but this is a dud. Made up of Family Guy scripting that falls flat, predictable humor and plot, and vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity that isn't very funny and adds nothing. There are a few funny moments, but they fail to carry the movie. It appears that the writing team is better when they have to work around the FCC's television rules."
4,good movie,"this was a very funny movie and luved the jokes in it,worth watching again and would actually buy the movie to own its that good"
2,Kinda funny,"Ted had some pretty funny parts, also some really lame parts. I mean, it's a talking bear so...I'd wait for the TBS world premier."
4,Truly funny.,Best purchase this year. They really sell it. If you ever wondered what a Teddy bear sounds like.... this ain't it!
4,Not Bad - Some Chuckles,"Okay lets get this out -if you are a fan of Family Guy, then rent the flick. Sure Ted sounds at times a cross between Peter Griffin and Brian the dog, but Seth can only do so much lol.And Ralph Garmen as the Dad..he does voicework for Family Guy, and does Hollywood Babelon podcasts with Kevin Smith. Could have used more of him in the film.And Sam jones...wow whoever came up with him t add spice to the plot..well cool. We don;t see enough Flash in the world now."
5,Funny movie,"But this movie, One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Really, a pot smoking teddy bear? hahahaGood stuff"
3,As Expected,"This movie was exactly how I expected it to be. Kind of stupid and predictable, but still kind of funny and entertaining.Come on folks, it's about a bear who smokes pot."
2,Thought it would be funnier.,"I suppose it was hyped up too much and I thought I was going to be in tearful laughter during the whole movie but in all honesty it was more depressing and since being so unrealistic, it made the movie kind of awful."
3,Ted unrated,Movie is very funny but it's a little slow at times.concept is very original.producers of family guy should make more movies
4,Ted,Movie was funny and entertaining and would watch it again. This movie wasn't only humorous but has action and a sense of adventure to it. The romantic dialog was well written.
4,macfarlane is a genius,"very funny, like his other irreverent stuff, no taboo subjects, yet adds some humanity to the absurd, Wahlberg hits it also."
5,Funny! Funny! Funny!,"Kept waiting for Ted to come out. Worth the wait. Really hilarious. Wahlberg perfect for the role. Wife and I were in tears during some of the scenes and Ted's dialogue. By the way...we are in our 50s and the humor was raunchy at times, but GREAT! Hope there's a sequel."
5,hilarious,love the movie and it is a great gift also. we got this one for my youngest bro in law and he loves it too
2,Really bad comedy,"I am not sure how this won any awards, very unfunny compared to family guy or american dad. I do not recommend it."
2,Not what I expected,"For us this movie was a waste of time. A few funny parts, wish it was hilarious, but it was not."
3,Bad Language. NOT for kids!,"Pretty juvenile. I like these actors though, but can't understand why Seth McFarland's movie had to be quite so ""lame"""
1,Gen Y Trash,"Although I've watched South Park and Family Guy, some of the vulgar content in this movie made me uncomfortable. This movie just had too much profanity and obscenity for my taste. Some jokes were overused and funny at first, got old very fast. As a result, the movie dragged, became boring and a waste of time. I didn't find Ted likable at all. Plus, Seth MacFarlane didn't attempt to give him a voice different from Peter in Family Guy so every time Ted spoke I imagined Peter from Family Guy. That's just lazy on Seth MacFarlane's part. And I find Peter one of the least likable characters on Family Guy which may have played a huge part in my disliking of this movie. The plot is not good. In fact, it feels quite juvenile compared to the writing on Family Guy. There is still much was left to be desired in the story. Glad I didn't waste hard earned money on this one."
4,Great movie with plenty of great moments,"Friendship, love, life, is there anything else? All the performances were excellent and not cheesy or over the top at all, very sincere, average people with an extraordinary manifestation of a wish to represent our inner realities in an external, tangible way."
3,Meh,"It was a funny film, but it was not as funny as all the hype suggested. It's essentially family guy, but with a teddy bear instead."
5,Great Movie - NOT for children,"I actually saw the movie at the theatre, and my ""better half"" loved it so much that she had to have the Blu-ray. BUT, THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY NOT A CHILDRENS MOVIE --- ADULTS ONLY!!!"
2,A let down,"I was very excited to watch this movie. Sadly, I wish that I could get the hour and a half of my time back. A total let down"
3,Mediocre,It's a bit weird and much less funny than I expected. Ultimately it is just another chick-flick with a strange teddy-twist.
2,Ted Isn't Terrific,"I considered many ways to describe this film, but most people have already covered it. So, I'll reduce my review to a single word: tedious."
2,Ugh,Occasionally funny but mostly just crude. General plot of the movie was stupid to begin with and vulgarity and nudity don't help.
5,Hilarious!,"Be warned, this is a rated R movie and it is vulgar and inappropriate. That is what I loved about this movie! Not at all what I expected. This movie is not for kids but for all of us adults who remember the 80's. Great, funny movie!"
3,Ted,"It had it's funny moments. But, a bit too crude and over top. Still fun to watch. It was worth watching with the right crowd."
2,Just ok.,"Just ok. All the funniest parts wee on the previews. It was too long for a comedy in my opinion. I like it, but I'm not in hurry to watch it again."
5,Hillarious,I loved this show. Funny to see the innocence turn to an attitude of hardened reality. Over the top never gonna happen situation with a bear coming to life turned comedy.
3,Ted,Fairly predictable but funny. Not appropriate for kids. The family of adult children watched this together and all enjoyed it
3,Just really not funny,"it's tolerable, but not funny at all.a little chuckle here and there a good movie to fall asleep to"
1,I wish I could give it zero stars.,Long and lame. I expected it to be funny and it was a waste of my time and 5 bucks.
2,Meh.,Not the funniest movie that everyone said it was. We honestly expected more from this. It was essentially Family Guy Live Action.
1,Ted DVd,I heard this Movie was Hilarious. Next to the Dictator it was the worst comedy I ever saw. Service was quiuck and product arrived undamaged.
3,not suitable for kids,it is a move that futures a kids toy but it does not ac like it i use the shock comedy but that is ben used too much so it is copy cat
1,Terrible movie,Watched it for ten minutes and then turned it off. Nothing clever about the script and the profanity was overboard.
4,teddy bear,This movie was good it was like family guy for grown folks if I had to see it again I would
2,Ted,"The movie was humorous in a few parts but as a complete flick it was lame. (Four more words required, thats lame too.)"
5,Ted,Did not watch this movie yet..Still downloading. Our internet is so slow it will take 24 hours to get it here. Good thing I have a month to watch it. and I can't wait!!
2,i wanted to like this movie but ...,usually entertaining Mark W. didn't quite hit the bull's eye with this comedy - some funny scenes no doubt but I think I saw them all in the trailers ...
1,Couldn't make it through this,We all fell asleep. I don't get the popularity of this. Maybe I am too old. My husband never suggests turning off a movie if he has paid for it.
1,"no, thanks","To each his own, but, for me, oh my God, this movie sucked. I won't go into details as to why. I understand the point of growing up, moving on, swapping childhood for adulthood, but I thought this was truly awful. Not funny and truly boring."
2,SOPHOMORIC CINEMA,"I think that there is a place for silliness and humor in movies, but I just grew a bit tired of the rude and crude approach to humor that is characteristic of Seth Macfarlane's offerings. At his best he is a subversive and spot on satirist. At his worst (which is often) he is tiresome and boorish. I do not believe that it takes much cleverness or creativity to produce such a movie. There is not 2 hours of material here that constitutes a movie. Not the best investment of an adult's time."
1,Never should have spent the monet on this movie,"If your normal convertation has F*** this and F*** that, its your kind of movie. this is not a movie to show kids, i did not thank goodness.I should get my money back."
1,junk,since when did it become funny to be vulgar?are we at a point in our limited history of becoming soloud and vulgar that we think that it's funny to be that way.
1,This movie was not good,"If you love fart/butt jokes, this might appeal to you. Otherwise don't bother. Other than a very funny party scene about 60% through the movie, the humor is too random and flat. I was actually bored of the whole thing with about 20 minutes of story left. The ending is formulaic and lame."
1,Ted,"Stupid college humor...I like marky mark as a tough guy, not a pot smoking bum with a teddy bear for a best friend."
1,BOREING...........,"Heard from everyone that this movie was great, only to find out for myself that half-way through I wanted to turn it off... c'mon Marky-Mark.. your better than this.."
1,GOT TO RATE UP THERE AS ONE OF THE WORST,JUST NOT FUNNY. FOUL LANGUAGE DID NOT HELP AT ALL! MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER TO GEAR IT TOWARD CHILDREN INSTEAD OF ADULTS.
1,Really?,Not funny. Sad really. A huge waste of time and $4 dollars. Not a lot more to say. Wish someone had warned me.
1,"Two hours of my life, gone!!!",Worst...movie...ever. This movie makes the best case yet for the need to rate something '0' stars. I would have been far more entertained if my wife just put a sock puppet on her hand and yelled obscenities for half an hour.
2,For The Undiscriminating Only,"Complete and total rubbish. Lame humor depending on crudeness and nothing else. Not clever, just plain dumbed down foolishness. For those of you who like your dialogue inane, your plot silly, and your acting like cardboard cutouts, this should please you immensely. It's actually kind of insulting how bad this is, but the whole premise kind of guarantees one predictable, stupid gag after another. A complete waste of time and money. Enjoy!"
3,It was okay.,"It was an okay movie, I don't really get all the hype around it. I mean there were parts that were funny but most of the parts were somewhat sick and disturbing. I understand that was sort of the point with having a teddy bear come to life, but i felt like after watching this movie i became dumber. If that even makes sense, the ending almost saved it but still it was a movie that I would never intend on watching again."
4,Simple story with stupid jokes - Loved it!,"This movie was great. I love these comedies and I do get the humor it has.You got to really get the kind of cruel and stupid humor to really enjoy the movie, if you don't than you will hate it from start to finish. The humor they use mainly involves drugs, sex, or alcohol use. If you like family guy, it's like that but much more! If you don't like that stuff, please don't watch it as you would be wasting your time.I also loved Mark Wahlberg performance, he did a great job working with a pretend bear on screen. He really pulled it off with his acting skills. Mila Kunis was good, but she didn't really do much as all she was there was for mostly eye candy for the audience.The story itself is very simple and that's good as they didn't need to make it complex in any way. They just wanted to make a great comedy out of this.Watch it if you like what I said above. Don't watch it, if you don't like what I said above. lol"
1,One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.,"Until last night, I considered Entrapment with Catherine Zeta Jones as the worst movie I have ever seen. This atrocity of a movie now tops the list."
1,STUPID!!!!!,What was he thinking to do this movie???? If your over 15 dont get this movie pointless!!! Couldnt watch it all end up reading about half way.
4,Supper funny,Super funny movie. I loved all the 80s references. All around great cast. A bit of a corny ending but what can we expect about a movie starring a talking bear. Two thumbs up.
1,Sick,"Worst movie ever. After trying to watch, I realized it was worthless. I guess I wanted to try to get my monies worth. I thought for a while, this is got to get better... NOT! If there was a way to get a refund (even though the rental fee was only $299), I would have done it just for the principal. The cursing and the ""F"" bomb were unending. I think this type of movie is indication of where our society is headed.... in the gutter. Run away from this movie as fast as you can. I don't think I'll ever watch another movie with Mark Wahlberg again. He should have known better."
1,ted,I If you like foul mouthed teddy bears you'll love this farce but for me. It was wasn't worth the rental price
2,meh.....,"not as funny as I would have liked. Too much of a story line, it would have been a little better as a complete joke of a movie. I think they tried to make it a real movie and killed it."
3,Into Watching Self Destructive Behavior?,"Clever, technically well done. The turning point is when a couple of creeps kidnap Ted, and he dies and then comes back to life because the girlfriend wishes it. Not convincing, and not something I could really relate to either."
1,Maybe Not For Me,"Base on previews, we thought this movie would be hilarious. Much of the humor went too far for my taste."
1,Don't Watch it.,"This should have never made it off the launch pad. It seriously makes me want to never watch TV again. I feel that my IQ just dropped 10 points after watching. Every now and then I don't mind some ""stupid"" humor such as ""There's something about Mary"" but this was just plain HORRIBLE!!"
1,Disappointing,"While my husband and I laughed at a number items, overall it was bad. We kept watching think ""this has to get better"" but it didn't."
1,Horrible,Almost unwatchable. Only reason I sat through to the end was that I paid four bucks. Would have possibly been okay had I had some of that mind rape.
3,meh..,"Not as crass and trashy as I was expecting, this movie has more heart and a lot less boobs than I would've guessed. It's just a really strange movie - not as laugh out loud funny or as overtly offensive as a lot of Seth MacFarlane's other work."
3,Not nearly as funny as they claim,"I was pretty disappointed, considering it was advertised as one of the funniest movies ever. Most of the ""funny"" was in the trailer. It was too serious for me."
3,Eh..,"While I knew what to expect (I watch Famiy Guy and American Dad all the time) I guess I didn't consider the time. While the 30 minute TV shows are funny, the hour long movie kind of dragged on for me."
2,"A few laughs, but just a few",My daughter suggested we watch the movie. It was funny in spots but ran out of gas about half way through. My wife fell asleep and I fast forwarded thru parts of it.
2,"Lame, lame, and more lame",This is truly a case of the best lines of the movie being shown in the previews. Huge disappointment. Don't waste your time or money.
3,Ted,You saw all the funny parts on the previews. I felt like this movie was a let down after hearing it was going to be so good.
2,Not for children,"The movie itself is slightly entertaining. Some parts are ""OK"" but more than anything the shock factor is what makes you laugh. I would never consider letting my children watch this."
4,Pretty funny!,"We laughed a lot while we were watching Ted, it was pretty funny. A little silly at times but a good laugh."
2,Disappointing,"The only funny scenes were in the 1st half of the movie, most of which were spoiled in the previews. Then, half way through the movie, it turned weird and almost like they were switching to romantic comedy format. Extremely disappointing, as I looked forward to seeing this for over 6 months."
2,Movie was awful,"I expected this movie to be hilarious, and while I laughed in parts, it was juvenile and surprisingly unfunny. I actually like raunchy humor... well... funny raunchiness. I had expectations for Ted, and maybe that is why I was disappointed, but in general, I felt like it was a waste of time and money."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"Mature adults have no business laughing--uncontrollably in some instances--at scatalogical humor, high school hijinks or boorish behavior. That's why I'm glad I watched ""Ted"" at home. Yep, Ted's libido is large, his intelligence tiny (although probably huge among his stuffed bear colleagues) and he has absolutely no sense of political correctness. This is a very funny movie, slowed only by the humans in Ted's life who keep making the same relationship mistakes. Watch it, without the kids, but don't say I told you to."
2,Watch the Commercials again instead,If you're looking for a comedy then watch the Commercials or Trailers for this movie instead. Spoiler Alert... It was satisfying to see the bear get ripped in half.
1,Pathetic,"After about 15 minutes of waiting to see if there was any possibility of finding something remotely entertaining we pulled the plug. Ted is with out a doubt the worst movie ever. There was nothing even mildly entertaining in this piece which features a constant barrage of vulgarity, crude sexual innuendo and dope smoking. Sometimes even a bad film is un-intendedlyfunny because it's so bad but this one couldn't even score in that regard.."
1,Not very funny. Degrading of women.,"There were few funny moments. The film would have benefited from greater editing. It dragged on and, at times, lost my attention."
1,Horrible movie.,I almost turned it off and I never turn movies off. Maybe if you are drunk or high it would be better.Story was not even funny. I thought this was a comedy.
1,"Crass, dirty, juvenile and unfunny","This movie was just disgusting. The character of Ted was just too disgusting and rude to find funny. The movie was oriented towards twenty-something frat dudes who love bad words and smoking weed. The ""comedy"" is just vile crude jokes by the characters. The writers clearly have no real skill in creating clever jokes.If you have an education, any semblance of a mature mind, or something else to do, don't watch this movie."
1,Can't Believe How Bad,This is just horrible. I cannot believe how bad. Save your money and your time.Wahlberg is horrible. He is not funny. He is not a good actor. He and Kunis haveno chemistry. This movie is a dog.
4,Thunder Buddies For Life!,I was going to see this movie the Friday it came out but I decided not to. I figured despite the positive buzz that no one would see it and it was really a flop.How surprised I was when I saw that it came in #1 at the box office last weekend.I'm not really one for seeing comedies in the theater but I decided what the heck.And I'm glad I did.A little boy makes a wish and his teddy bear comes to life.They both grow up and sure enough funny things happen.Excellent acting.Some really funny/dirty stuff in this movie.The middle dragged a little and that's the only reason I gave it four stars and not five.The ending gets a little tear jerky which was a nice touch.All in all.An excellent raunchy comedy with a lot of heart to it.I love the bear. :)Recommended.
3,Amusing for awhile,"Essentially a one-trick pony. The premise is funny at first, but not funny enough to support an entire movie. Still, if you've got nothing better, there are worse ways to spend an evening."
3,It's OK,Kind of predictable juvenile humor. Would not recommend for family viewing. My teenage son and husband thought it was hilarious.
3,Silly funny,"This is not a Oscar comedy, but if you like basic adult humor you will like the movie. It has some good moments."
2,Amazon's online movie service was horrible!,"I ordered this movie with the intent of my wife and I watching it instantly. I got repeated errors stating that the movie could not be played at that time. I thought it might be my FIOS connection so I tried Netflix and other online video sources like U Tube to see if they were working properly, which they were. After verifying it wasn't my internet connection I tried to watch Ted again and after multiple attempts I still got the same error. It took me almost two days, and the rental period had almost expired, before I was able to successfully watch the movie. The Amazon service was horrible! The only reason that I gave this two stars instead of one is that the movie, while very raunchy, was hilarious...."
3,Funny but silly,"Some good one liners, but not the greatest. It was nice to laugh after a long work week but not the comedy of the year."
4,Funny,"Laugh out loud, movie! I was almost not tempted to watch it as a talking bear was in it, but over all very funny."
2,Not impressed,"First of all I am a huge Family Guy and American Dad fan. I really like Seth McFarland's comedy. That being said, this movie fell really short for me. It's as if he did a rough draft of the script one afternoon and they greenlit the project and never did a rewrite. I'm starting to think that while Mr. McFarland can come up with some great ideas he still needs his room of writers to hash them out for him. Normally I find Marky Mark and Mela Cunis quite funny but they were also very flat in this movie. I don't know what all the hype is about. I like fart jokes but I like good fart jokes. This movie felt like a rough rough draft of what could have been something great. Unfortunately it killed at the box office so we probably see something very similar soon. If there is a Ted 2 I may have to write my congressman."
1,"Nothing clever - If I could give 0 stars, I would","We were lured in because we like Family Guy, but since there are apparently no rules for making movies, macfarlane used explicit language for shock value instead of doing something clever. There was zero humor and the characters made no sense. Kunis' character, who is put together and supposed to be intelligent, was with the teddy bear and Wahlberg's moronic dead beat character for 4 years because he was hot?! Don't get the Flash Gordon cocaine thing... Very random...Probably a guy with too much money, backing, and no ideas making a movie..."
4,Marky Mark and his teddy come together,"Teddy bears are usually little romantic cuddle buddies for youngsters and cheesy gifts you give your girlfriend. Ted on the other hand is a hell raising, perverted bear that could party with the most outrageous of fraternity guys and rock stars.There are laughs coming from everywhere in this flick which is to be expected when you're watching Seth MacFarlane, but I was surprised at the beauty of the storyline here. You wouldn't expect it, but this is a well written love story. Mila Kunis plays her role as a snobby girlfriend well, and Marky Mark plays the man caught between girl and Teddy Bear very well. Watching their story unfold is a joy.If you're a family guy fan than this is a must see, and if not, as long as you can appreciated some dirty jokes and aren't easily offended, this movie will suit you well. Tune in to Ted and never look at another innocent teddy bear the same again."
3,ok rude but had to laugh,growing up with the bear every one knows it speaks and interacts with the guys not for children really not for children
1,Terrible!!,Mark wahlberg should be embarrassed. I can't believe they're even considering a sequel. I would give it zero stars if it was possible.
1,What a Waste,"For the first 15 minutes, the idea of watching a cute and fluffy Teddy bear act raunchy and rude... was funny. By 20 minutes in the novelty had worn off and it was just raunchy and rude. I'm not bothered by that... it just wasn't funny."
2,Terrible,"Terrible movie..way too much swearing...moved too slow, boring, poor acting..wished I'd waited to check it out free from the library."
3,Overrated.,It seemed formulaic. You can see where the plot is going from a mile away. You might as well watch an episode of Family guy and save yourself an hour.
3,ok but not as funny as advertised,i liked this movie but it was really only mildly funny. worth watching but definitely not one of the best movies I've ever seen.
2,"Disgusting Vulgarity Packaged in a Childish, Seemingly Cute and Benign Form","Not sure why everything with Seth Macfarlane has to involve fecal matter, or something else outrageously and unnecessarily vulgar. One case in point was Family Guy's Christmas special hosted by his dad...not sure why anyone needs such specific references to bodily functions, but you will see the same sickness in Ted. At times it is a very cute movie and some dirty male jokes are fine...but this movie makes you wonder: That wasn't funny....it actually made me heave...why would a sane person put that in a mainstream movie? I have the same issue with many of the more recent comedies done by the SNL crowd and National Lampoon. Some dirt and nudity is fun, but the obsession with detailed bodily functions is disgusting and other movies filled with weird deviant sex often takes the place of a well-developed storyline aimed at entertaining the non-porno folks."
2,Meh,Meh.It was a good Boston fix.Great fight scene.Flash Gordon...Meh.Reminded me of pathetic loser homies..Just meh.
2,Not very good!,"This movie looked to be funny by the trailer, but it turned out to be a disappointment. I only finished it because I paid to stream it. Would not recommend this one!"
4,hilarious!,"What this movie loses with the fairly typical plot line of bad-boyfriend-matures-to-keep-girlfriend, it more than makes up in over-the-top humor. Nothing like watching a cuddly, talking teddy bear taking bong hits.Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis turn in solid rom-com performances.This is not for you if you don't like a few raunchy jokes or Seth McFarlane's humor."
2,"What a waste of $3,99","Starts off to be promising, but most of the movie stooped to idiotic humor that wasn't even funny. Why Hollywood feels that people want to see stuff like this, is beyond me. Expected a lot more."
3,Just ok,"The best parts of the movie are in the trailer. Ok, but not as funny as I hoped it would be."
4,A real Comedy Drama,"Laugh and enjoy the caracters, didn't think I would enjoy as much as I did. This is adult comedy not for the litttle ones. Think it will be a hit."
2,Not as funny as expected...,"I love all sorts of ""stupid"" humor... Anchorman, Adam Sandler movies ect. but this really wasn't anything special. Couple of chuckles not much else."
3,Ted is Quirky!,I loved the animation of the bear. The story is different and the movie has its moments but I thought it was unnecessarily vulgar. I cal it high school humor. The plot was so so.
3,DVD Problems...,The first time we watched this movie it stopped several times and then a second or 2 later it would continue where it left off.
3,Ted,One of those movies where you saw all the good scenes in the adds. I may just be getting to old for this type of humor
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I like Seth McFarland,and the trailers looked pretty good. However, I hardly laughed at all, and just didn't think it was funny. The premise was stupid and it just didn't click with me."
3,it was ok,had some funny parts but other besides that it's average at best..would not watch again or buy the dvd..thanks .
3,Not as funny as I thought it would be,Didn't laugh much and thought the bear was just OK. I wouldn't recommend it for the price. The last 10 minutes was the best part of the movie.
4,Hilarious and fun,"This is a excellent comedy and directorial debut from Seth Macfarlane. It takes a 'realistic' look at an imaginary teddy-bear that comes to life. The film is a lot fun with a decent plot and great acting (Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis) and voice over work (Seth Macfarlane).If you are looking for fun, well made comedy, this is highly recommended."
3,"If you like Seth McFarlane's humor, you'll love it.","Though funny at times, this movie is simply 2 hours of live action Family Guy.Mila Kunis was fun to look at during lulls between jokes."
2,"stupid, not funny","This is a bad comedy, a bad script. I wanted to enjoy it. Everything in the other reviews was right. Skip this."
2,all the funny parts were in the previews :(,"I am a huge fan of ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"". this movie was about 45 minutes too long and both of those shows are much more funny. parts had us laughing out loud, but it was a stretch to make it a full-length movie that was entertaining for only half."
3,Some good one liners,"if you want to see a bear do some raunchy things, this movie is for you. its got some funny one liners but I was hopeful for a better movie."
2,Teenagers might like this movie.,A bear that smokes pot and drinks and cohorts with hookers--really? I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one at the movie theatre. The puppetry was excellent and the acting was good. There were a few funny lines. I turned this movie off about thirty minutes before it ended. I will never look at teddy bears the same way again.
4,Good movie,Very poor quality................. uuuuuu amcmiwic j ndndn cjdn b dbnwjwkk cndnd dden cneekd dn fjkk fddm disisi dd c dd
4,Funny!,"If you want to watch a movie to laugh and have a good time, this is what you looking for. Do not expect something profound or sensitive."
2,Awful!!!!!,"the awful lanugage, the sex just wasnt funny Dry humping a pole at a grocery store of all places. The drug smoking!!!!"
2,SIGH,I LOVE MARK AND WHAT'S HER HEAD BUT THIS MOVIE IS SUCKING FOR ME :( IT'S ONLY BEEN ON ABOUT 20 MINUTES OR SO AND I'M READY TO FAST FORWARD. IT'S NOT FUNNY AT ALL. LIKE ANOTHER VIEWER SAID IT'S JUST STUPID. OH WELL.. I STILL LOVE MARK AND WHAT'S HER HEAD :) I HAD A BRAIN FART AND FORGOT HER NAME! AND FYI.. THE BOYS WOULD BE CLEANING UP THE POO IN THE FLOOR!
2,Ted,I rented it despite the reviews. The reviews were right. It was awful. It was just stupid. Not funny stupid. Just stupid. The vulgar jokes were pitiful. Would NOT suggest renting.
2,Eh no.,I really expected to laugh.. At least Mila Kunis was in it. Beautiful actress. She it's the only reason I gave the movie a couple stars!
1,dog of a movie,"lame predictable, lost interest in it soon. Wahlberg is wasting his talent on this one. what a plot could do for it."
2,disappointed,Maybe I'm more old fashioned than I thought but really couldn't get past the foul language enough to enjoy the comedy. Was it funny? I don't know.
2,Kind of Lame,"There were parts that were funny, but sigh... another juvenile, not funny comedy although much of the content is definitely adult."
4,It was somewhat entertaining.,It was a good movie but the plot was not new. It would have been better if it was a tragedy.
4,"Funny the first time, but not a lot of rewatch potential","Saw Ted in theaters and hadn't laughed that hard since Anchorman. However, unlike the Channel 4 News Team, Ted didn't have the same appeal the second time. Still funny, but it doesn't have the one liners that make me WANT to watch it again. Wahlberg does comedy with the best of them, so seeing him is always a treat. Absolutely worth seeing at least once."
3,a little dissappointed..,It was great to actually put a face to some of the characters from family guy.However i was disappointed about the humor i expected it to have a family guy feel to it
4,Pretty good movie! Mila is a Hottie,I liked it some may have a problem wrapping there head around it but if you watch Famlily guy and others you will like it as its the same humor. Also I love Mila in this movie... she is stunning.
4,streaming to xbox,the video quality was good and the process was very easy would rent again ... the movie wasn't bad either
3,prob 3.5,not worth seeing in theater though entertaining.some good laughs in there.maybe wahlberg not best choice - younger actor better?
3,Amusing,"Mediocre entertainment, but worth the watch. Atleast Mark Walburg did better than the bear acting. Didn't make want to go buy myself a Teddy as an adult."
3,Not Mark Wahlberg's best movie,It was a cute concept. but it had a lot of hokey stuff in it. I wouldn't watch it again. I certainly wouldn't recommend it for young teens or children. It had a lot of drugs and sexual stuff in it.
3,Thought it would be better,"was kind of dumb, as much as they advertised it I thought it would be much better than what it was."
3,Disappointed.,Disappointed. Thought from the trailers that it was going to be funnier. Didn't think a lot of the off-color humor was humerous.
3,Vulger,The humor could have still been there with out all the vulgarity. Was not what I expected. Other than that I did like it.
3,"Entertaining, but pretty much just an extended Family Guy",Not a bad flick to watch but it's the same humor as an episode of Family Guy. Just one more character that will have more fame than Seth MacFarlane.
2,hilarious,this is not a kid movie at all. so i encourage parents to really think twice. Its a more adult film. I have to say it was hilarious for those that do not take life too seriously and that are ok with any type of language and expression. The story line isnt too bad. but it isnt something i havent seen before.
4,Worth the rental,"Not the best movie I have ever seen, but fun and entertaning. The bear is very well done. And Mark Wahlberg is always skillful at his art!!"
3,VERY OVER RATED,"I understand the concept of the movie but it over reached to get laughs. It was just OK. Can""t see a part 2"
2,Slow and not funny,"I love family guy and thought i would enjoy this type of humor, but I quit watching after the first half hour. The movie just seemed to drag and never really got started for me."
5,very funny,very funny and original. This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. It was great.
1,Worthless Movie.,This was a waste of a $2.99 rental. Third grade humor. We wanted a funny movie but this was just silly stupid.
1,Boring and Infantile,The plot and humor are geared toward pre-teens. Anyone older than 10 will be bored pretty quickly. Don't waste your time.
3,pretty good for a dumb premise,Seth Macfarlane and Mark Wahlberg are funny enough to make this work. Everyone enjoyed it and got several laughs throughout.
1,Fairly Boring,"A few funny parts for a 13 year old. I think it was a poor roll for Walberg and Mila Kunis who I really like. Seth Macfarlane isn't funny for most adults though, so if you have a hard time with Pot and fart jokes, I would pass."
4,"Enjoyable, Funny, but not Great","Very funny movie at times, but not uproariously hilarious. Was enjoyable to watch, but I doubt I would watch it again. Just a fun movie to enjoy with friends, but not a classic you'd want to watch over and over. Also, maybe it was just me, but the voice of Ted was too much like Peter Griffin (there's even a joke about this in the movie) so when I looked away or closed my eyes, it was just weird. Even more weird since Mila Kunis is in the movie (she voices Meg) and the two characters often converse."
3,Ted,It was funny but to much profane language. Children could not look at this. It would be much more likeable if much cleaner.
1,waste of a good date night,My husband thought this would be funny and I was hesitant but finally agreed. Within 20 minutes we both didn't want to watch another minute.He told me we could watch anything else. Not funny just dumb movie. I guess of you ever wanted your teddy ruxpin to come alive you might be mildly amused.
2,This movie stunk,"It was very disappointing. A few laughs here and there, but overall not that great. I would not recommend this movie."
2,it's a guy movie,"foul language , story line just stupid, don't waste your time or money, you'll be more entertained watching a PBS show.."
2,Target Audience: Men who were young in the 80s.,"I can't say I laughed once while watching this movie, and I generally enjoy semi-crass popular comedies (for example: Get Him to the Greek, Team America, Tropic Thunder). The storyline was fairly predictable, but okay. As a twentysomething, non-Family Guy-fan, female, I am definitely not who this movie was trying to reach. My husband and brother-in-law got a kick out of it. Basically, if you are a male from the late 70s/early 80s, who likes Family Guy and LOVED Flash Gordon...this one is for you."
3,lotsa buffering,"The movie was pretty funny but this was the 1st time I had a n amazon movie stop so many times to buffer, I don't know if it was your end or mine but I watched something on netflix right after and it was fine.Mike"
4,"I din't think I would like it, but....",I couldn't believe I actually liked this movie. I was surprised and laughed my you know what off! Definately not for kids!!!!!!
3,Worth a Rent,Movie is funny but not as funny as I thought it would be. If you like Family Guy then you will like this.
3,Funny.,"A bit stupid, but if you are up for simple dumb humor then its a decent movie. It had some moments of greatness, but overall I can only give it 3 stars."
4,Funny,It's hangover kind of humor but not as funny. I would watch it again but not sure I would own it.
1,Predictable,Not nearly as funny as I expected it to be. It was predictable and flat. Way overhyped in my opinion.
3,"he's a cute little ""bear""","When visiting my Marine grandson, his mom,dad,granddad,he and I decided to see Ted on a rainy day. Picture this-Movie full of young Marines,my young guy sitting next to me. When I looked at him I saw tears in his eyes and he is trying not to choke laughing ,because the movie is raunchy and perverse and he is sitting with his grandmother. Finally when the seat started to shake I had to give in and laugh and laugh at him,which made him lose it.His Dad (behind him) was kicking the seat so he would'nt embarrass his grandmother. The whole theater ended in hysterics, I'm sure they were laughing at us as much as they were laughing at TED. The rating for seeing this movie with a young Marine grandson is - priceless."
3,Ok. but wouldn't watch again.,"Without going into the plot of the movie too much this is the one about the naughty teddy bear who comes to life. The previews of this movie stuck in my mind and my husband and I were both excited to see it. The intro of the movie starts out very funny and sets up the story well, but that's kinda where it stops. The middle and end of the film was ok but not very memorable with only a couple laughs that come to mind. We were both rather disappointed with the film overall because the previews and the possibilities of comedy with the story line is endless and they seemed to just produce a mediocre comedy. I would probably watch this one again on a Netflix stream or TV replay but would not pay for a rental of this one. 3 out of 5 starts."
1,You will have more to laugh at in the bathroom with a dirty mag.,"Didn't even finish watching it. Just plain awful. No humor, no story, no acting. Get a magazine and go in the bathroom with it and you'll have more fun. Would have given it zero stars if that had been an option... no on second thought - 3 stars."
5,"Trouble breathing, laughing so hard!","I saw this movie four times at the theater, then immediately pre-ordered it from Amazon in July 2012. Anyone living through the Vietnam era, the peace, love, smoking weed era is going to absolutely relate to this movie and have a great time laughing at all of the witty, commentary. I didn't know what to expect, but I love Mark Walberg and I love stuffed animals, so I thought, what the heck. I got so much enjoyment from this movie, I can't even describe it. Let's face it too, has Mark Walberg EVER done anything bad??? NO, he hasn't. Trust me, see the movie TED!"
4,Ted,Love the movie it was hilarious! Thought it would be a bit more funny but that's with pretty much any movie now a days. Seth McFarland really out did himself with this one
5,great movie,awesome movie had me laughing the whole time i plan to watch it again soon definetly a purchase i dont regret making
5,Funniest movie of the year,This movie makes me laugh everytime I watch it. Seth MacFarlane is hilarious. Anyone who watches and likes Family Guy will love Ted.
1,terrible,"no value at all, not even funny, better to have a root canal than watch this movie, sray away from this"
1,Pretty stupid,"It wasn't even funny, I turned it off and didn't even finish. What a waste of money. If only I could give it half a star, one is being generous."
4,funny,shouldn't the stars be enough. do these s****y comments actually help with anything. its a funny movie i gave it 4 stars stop sending s****y emails asking me to rate it.
2,Disappointing,Why was Mark Wahlberg in this?! (14 more words required?) I will never ever ever ever ever write a review again for you!!!
4,Great Bro Movie.,"Great friendship movie, Bro movie, not really a good Date movie, If you want to go at it alone go for it."
5,Frickin Hilarious,By far the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. It you like Family Guy or any of Seth McFarlane's other stuff you will probably like this.
2,Funny in other movies,"I'd say this movie was a homage to other, funnier, movies. Don't get me wrong, this is classified as a comedy so it was definitely supposed to be funny. I guess the soap squirt on the bear face was the high point and then everything after, and before, was substantially less funny.Having said that, you might as well rent it because if you are actually reading this review then you could be doing something better with your time."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!,"This movie is based on a silly premise that has no bearing with reality. All the characters have ""Potty-mouth"", and this can not be viewed with any decent company. Had I known that Seth MacFarlane had anything to do with this movie, I would not have paid a single penny for it!"
1,"Confusing ""unrated"" ....","This ""unrated"" confused both parent and kid, as we both think it is safe to all party. But not after 3 minutes we watched this movie with our 11 year old boy, we have to stop watching, because the movie is full of dirty words, I don't want them to pollute my kid's and my ear. So $2.99 wasted like that. won't buy any unrated stuff anymore ."
1,Absolutely hated it.,"With the ""F"" word coming out in every other sentence and then some, it made it pretty hard to watch. We lasted about 15 minutes and gave it up realizing it didn't have any real story line.I watch a lot of rated R movies, but this one was ridiculous. The writer obviously was going through an infantile period when he wrote it if he thought that was the only way to get laughs."
1,extremely vulgar,"could not finish watching, the language was quite repulsive and I'm not a prude! I wouldn't reccomend this to my worse enemy!"
3,Ted,"Its kind of a cute movie, but not one that I would purchase or watch again. Its a decent time waster."
3,nasty,"this moview was not as cute or as funny as I thought it would be, instead it tuned out to be perverted, not for teens or kids"
3,It was entertaining but not awesome,I'm pretty picky with comedies. It's worth watching but I didn't pee in my pants about it. I love Mark Walburg.
5,Thanks you,I was really Good movie andperfect image and pretty funnymy Family I was really Happy thanks for yours service
2,"okay, but not great","Ted had potential to be hilariously funny. However, it fell flat. I wouldn't say it was great, but the word Okay fits pretty well. Overall, I say watch it if you have the time and you enjoy that sort of comedy."
2,Not worth buying,The movie was really built up. Everybody said it was better than the hangover. I dont think so. I am glad I saw it but it was not as funny as the hype. And I'm not gonna waste 2 hours watching it again.
1,Not for kids,"This was one of the dumbest movies ive ever watched. Who would make a show about a farting, drug smoking Teddy Bear? Watch this movie only if you have a weird sense of humor."
1,Ted,Stopped watching after the first few minutes. Relies on sophmoric humor and grates on my ears with the over over over over over over use of the most vulgar language.
1,Turned it off after thirty minutes,"Would rate this right down there with ""Date Night"". Very little funny about constantly seeing a teddy bear with a bong, and the Oriental newscaster striking his female co-anchor. Walhberg's character and acting were so good in ""The Shooter"", it's a shame to see him going in this direction. C'mon Hollywood, if you are going to put out this kind of garbage, at least let the consumer watch the first fifteen minutes of the movie before they put out any money for a copy."
2,Too much of everything,"I am a huge Mark Wahlberg fan. I am sorry to say that this move is horrible. It goes places it really should not have. It could be funny, but I found it raunchy and trashy instead. What a shame."
1,Very disappointed.,"vulgar - language was just rude, not funny. Too bad, had potential. Won't recommend this movie to anyone. Definitely not for kids or young adults."
1,Worst movie I have seen in a long time!!!,Don't waste your money unless your in high school and appreciate pot smoking teddy bear movies!There is not much of a story line and also had a bad quality picture for a high definition movie.
1,Horrible movie!,This movie is NOT for children and adults should find it vile. Great premise but we walked out on it right away in the theatre. Don't waste your money!!
1,More than 1 star? How stupid are people?,"I find it depressingly amazing that anyone who doesn't need to be watered like a plant every day would find this sad excuse for a movie entertaining in any way. A sad excuse on just how simple and stupid so many people are.If you liked this horrible tripe of a movie, what movie won't you like?I would love to know the IQ's of all of you who gave this sad excuse of a film anything more than 1 star."
2,Weak,"It seemed like this movie had promise, but the jokes were few and far between and usually not funny. The story did nothing to redeem the movie either -- it was very weak and I got the feeling that the narration and the whole father/son thing at the end was just thrown in to add to the run time of the movie. It's rare for me to think a movie is not worth the rental fee but this one falls in that category."
5,LMAO!!! Very funny!,"If you like family guy or Markie Mark, you'll love this comedy. I laughed so hard through most of the movie, my chest hurt the next day. Surprisingly funny!"
4,Gosh darn CUTE!!,"If ever there was a movie to give you a needed lift, this is the one. Ted isn't the sweet quiet type though. He is loud and often obnoxious 'kind of funny.' Great ending, too."
5,To funny,Saw it in the theater and had to have it at home. The behind the scenes stuff was just great
4,I didn't have high expectations...,"...so I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie pretty entertaining. It had several laugh out loud moments, but don't expect any plot twists or anything."
3,3 Stars only,"I watched this video because of Seth MacFarlane...I love his work...but, the movie, Ted, fell short of what I have grown to expect from Mr. MacFarlane. It was like he was holding back (or maybe he was held back?) But, again, I do love MacFarlanes' work and will watch his next movie."
2,HD Quality,"The movie was pretty good, but I paid extra for HD quality and it was far from that. Other movies I've purchased on amazon were standard def and were a better quality than this HD."
2,Not Funny,"I'm not sure what I missed, but I do not see why so many people thought this movie was funny."
3,Trashy Language and content WARNING!!!!!,Language over the top....Howard Stren shiock humor. It was like standup comedy content. Could have done without all the trashy language
2,Its not that funnier. some times disgusting.,Its not that funnier. some times disgusting. Not worth spending $5 for HD print. wait for few more days until price get reduced to $2 or $1.
2,Disappointed,"It was too crass/vulgar. There were a couple genuinely funny parts, but it counted on its vulgarity to get too many of its laughs, which unfortunately seems to work for a lot of people these days. That made it disappointing to me."
1,review,"We thought it was pretty dumb really. I might have laughed twice during the whole movie. My 23 yr old daughter watched it as well (more her type of humor and so forth) and she also said ""It was pretty stupid""."
1,Not worth it!,"Horrible story and play, very disappointed with Mark Wahlberg performance. You probably gotta be high to like this movie. Not recommended!"
1,Bad!,"I thought this movie was going to be funny with some adult fun. However, it was NOT funny and I would never recommend this movie to anyone."
1,This is an unfunny movie.,This movie is not funny at all. This movie is not funny at all. This movie is not funny at all. This movie is not funny at all. This movie is not funny at all.
1,Terrible,"Not very funny. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I like the actors and have enjoyed them in other movies, not this one."
2,Stupid,"This movie is stupid, however I could see how many could find it entertaining if you are a fan of really dry stupid humor. I could also imagine the movie could be funny if you are really drunk or under the influence of some other drug, but overall just stupid and hard to watch. I would recommend watching the movie by renting it to save yourself the waste of money to buy it or better yet avoid it all together"
2,This movie is not very funny,This movie is not very funny.....I would not recommend paying for it or watching it at all unless you love the family guy.
2,Just Not That Funny,"Ok, the concept is funny and this movie has a few moments that are very funny, but overall it is a bit of a bore. The humor is very much in the vein of the Family Guy, but the disconnected jokes and asides just don't work that well in a full length movie. The concept is imaginative but the dialogue is not and the plot is pretty predictable. After the first chuckle over a dope smoking talking bear, the character of Ted becomes more annoying than anything else."
2,Not as funny as I expected (maybe my expectations were too high?),"Definitely funny moments, but ultimately this fell short of expectations. I think it just got to heavy/serious in the plot, which took away from the funnies. Started out good, but got weird lol. That thunderbuddies song had me in stitches though!"
3,Ted???,This movie had lots of promise. Great premise. Super teaser trailers. The movie itself really kind of dragged along (aside from the high-points we already had seen in the preview trailers).
3,Expected More,"I thought this could have been funnier then it was. Mark Wahlberg isn't the best actor, and the bear sounds exactly like Peter Griffen, you would think Seth could change his voice a little. Some pretty dumb jokes and scenes. Overall story wasn't very good."
2,"Great idea, boring movie","I really had high expectations for this movie...it sounded like a great idea and had some big names involved. Unfortunately it moves very slowly and is not nearly as funny as the previews lead you to believe. Sure it has some great, albeit brief, moments, but this is not going down in the archives as a classic. I'm glad I rented this one and did not buy it."
5,Very Creative,The idea of a raunchy teddy bear was very creative and provided some good laughs. At the same time it portrayed the struggle to grow up and take responsibility for your life.
3,Ted,"Pretty good, not as funny as my friends said it woould be, but really good. you reallly believe that Ted is real!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I love Family Guy and American Dad so my expectations for this movie were very high. I guess I expected more than a movie about smoking pot and being irresponsible. There were some good moments but in general I was very disappointed. I rented the movie, via streaming, with the intention of watching it more than once during the rental period but ultimately I had difficulty getting through it one time. Although the main characters had some good characteristics, I was generally unimpressed with them. They seemed very basic and undeveloped and not entirely likable."
2,Thought it would be better.,Very few funny moments. I guess I wanted more than just the same jokes on family guy. It ran a little long for what it was.
2,"The bear is funny for 10 minutes, then it gets stale...","Once you get past the basic premis of a teddy bear talking, swearing, smoking, etc., there is not much else to this movie. You would have to buy into the premis that this could actually happen to enjoy the story. Poorly written, weak storyline, predictable humor. Skip it and watch Caddy Shack for the 100th time. You'll laugh more."
2,"Eh, you gotta be a guy in the right mood",I just couldn't get into this. There were some clever lines but overall I felt like I needed to morph back to a high schooler to really embrace it.
1,Vulgar,I'm pretty laid back and the f bomb is a regular part of my vocabulary but i had to stop watching this. It's crude and vulgar and so not funny.
1,It is what it is...juvenile.,"But, I'm sure that is what it is suppose to be..........juvenile. It was a waste of $$$ even for the juvenile."
1,The same old stuff,Typical in-funny from a has been writer who shoulda just focused on something that wasn't just a rearrangement if everything he's already done into a boring and long mess of a movie.
2,stupid,"I considered renting this movie while at the Hilton in KCMO. Their price was $14.99. THANK GOODNESS I rented it here for $3, because that's about what it was worth.Sorry, I thought it was stupid & couldn't believe I watched it all the way through. Dumb story line, generally tacky over all."
2,Stupid,"I didn't really know what it was about ahead of time, maybe if I knew more what I was up for it would've been funnier."
3,"Entertaining movie, not as funny as I thought it would be","I am a fan of Seth MacFarlane and Family Guy so I figured I would love this movie. While I found the movie entertaining, I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would have."
2,Thankfully I did not have high hopes to start with......,"Mark Wahlberg has stooped pretty low - I love comedy, but this was just strange. There was way too much emphasis on drug usage."
2,Don't waste your money! Wahlberg's worst.,One of the first scenes of the movie are of Wahlberg and Ted getting high on the couch. How appropriate since I felt like I needed to be high to watch this show. It had the mentality of a childrens show with cursing. Adam Sandler would be proud that his movies are smarter(and that's not saying much).
2,Some Funny Scenes But Overall Bad,Some friends told us they liked this movie. It wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. Below average rental.
2,ted,Not so funny and kind of crude for a teddy bear! It did not show up the acting skills of the real people in it.
2,"Wasn't that funny,nor was the story well told.",MacFarlane needs to stick to cartoons and stay out of the movie business of find a good script editor that knows the business.
1,Absolutely terrible,This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not watch the whole thing it was so inane.Do not waste your time or money on this. I thought it would be good because of the actors in it but man was I in for a shock.
2,Teen male humor,"not worth the money,the only good part was maybe the last 15 to 20 minutes not enough to redeem it"
3,Parts were very funny... parts weren't....,"This is one of those movies that has some great parts to it but, at times, it drags. Not bad and would recommend if you have no expectations and enjoy raunchy humor."
3,Tri-polar,"This movie could not decide whether it wanted to be a kids' magic story, a raunchy bromance, or a chick flick. Since those goals are mutually exclusive, it pretty much failed at all three."
1,Not worth it!,Pretentious and elitist. Typical closed minded liberal crap. Not worth the time. Save your money and don't waste precious time.
2,Not funny,"I expected Ted to be funny. I got bored half way through and did not watch the movie to the end. I found this movie annoying, in your face and unsubtle. From the excessive dope smoking, swearing, crudeness, immaturity, self absorbance, just another Bro-mance tween movie....a lazy movie, not witty at all. I like the concept of the movie yet the product is another terrible Hollywood comedy. Shame, Mark Wahlberg has been is some really great movies (The Departed for one and more). This just wasn't one of them."
3,"For the hype, I expected better","Not a fan of MacFarlane or Family Guy in general, but I do occasionally find a bits and pieces of Family Guy entertaining. That being said, I watched this movie with an open-mind due to the great reviews. Pretty meh to say the least. It has a few parts that I would consider funny, but overall got boring at times and predictable. Acting was decent, but the plot was pretty thin. I'd say the most impressive performances of the film was Kunis and Ribisi. If you expect Family Guy-level laughs though, this film fails to deliver overall."
2,"No, Nope, Eh...","I wanted to like it, but man, it really was not good. I like Mila Kunis, but still couldn't like this movie."
4,Ted,"Overall a funny movie, but did have a few just silly and stupid moments that did not work for me."
3,Snort,"When I laugh hard I tend to snort, as well.Ted provided a few such moments. Otherwise it was a clever and well executed project that could have been much better. It's edginess and technical virtuosity took the film halfway, but thereafter it was more Friends than Louie CK. That disappointed me."
1,NOT SWEET!!,I had read no reviews for this movie but had seen the ads on tv. I thoughtit would be a sweet movieWas I ever wrong!The language was just obsceneI kept it on approx 5 minutes and cancelled it
2,It has its funny moments,"While it's somewhat funny at times, it's mostly just dumb and raunchy. It seemed to go on and on with no real direction until closer to the end. I wish I'd borrowed or rented it, rather than buying."
1,Dumb movie,"If you like teenage slapstick, this movie is for you. Also, teddy bears and old men do not sit around and do the same things that these two do together."
1,Disappointing,"Predictable plot line, comedic timing always seemed just off, a profuse amount if vulgarity to make up for pathetic jokes... Sorely disappointed since I love markie mark and had sen all the hype attached to this movie"
1,Overrated! Talking Teddy bear?,"Gave it, a chance and lost 1 hour and a half of my life on this! Garbage, couple of funny jokes but overall dull and the jokes were lame. Save yourself and watch something better."
1,What was that?,"THE Worst POS excuse for a movie EVER! It was like a bad episode of Family Guy. What a piece of crap waste of time, thanks a lot Amazon, I'll never buy a movie from you again."
1,"Stupid, Horrible Language","This move actually starts looking as a pleasant entertaining film. However the language is so terrible, that we turned it off. Really annoyed to have to pay for this garbage. Do not waste your money."
1,Childish nonsense,"I hated this film. It was aimed at a 10-year-old boy's sensibility/humor, but was completely inappropriate for that age level. I'm not sure where they intended to go with this script, but wherever it was, I didn't get there. I can't imagine how anyone, no matter how juvenile their humor, could give this crap 5 stars."
1,Don't waste your money:,"I thought it was a dumb, vulgar and a waste of money and time.I am a Mark Wahlberg fan, but was very disappointed that he would stoop to doing such a dumb movie."
4,Hillarious!,I really enjoyed Mark and Ted in this movie. Very incredible how the bear is so lifelike. Highly recommend this movie.
4,Funny,Worth a laugh. It'd just about what you'd expect from the cast and creators. Have a few drinks with friends and laugh.
2,Really not the best.,"It had some funny dialogue but overall it was kinda stupid, especially if you're from Boston and know people don't talk like they're drunk like everyone in this movie.Mila is perfect. A+ performance on her part. God she's hot..."
3,Not as great as I had hoped,"Let me start by saying I watched Family Guy long before it was popular, back when it was taken off the air before it even had a chance. So naturally I figured this would be a good fit for me. Sadly, that was not the case.Overall, the movie wasn't all that funny. There were a few scenes that made me laugh, but a lot of it totally missed the mark. I understood the references and where Seth was trying to go with things, it simply didn't work. The movie seemed like it was too long and should have been shortened. Maybe by cutting down the party scene with Flash Gordon as that seemed to go on for quite some time (until Ming entered into the picture).I started out looking forward to this comedy but left with the sad realization that it was more of an unfunny bromance."
2,Movie was garbage,"I probably chuckled twice, that's why I gave it too stars. If you like dry humor that will barely make you smile, this movie is for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
3,Over rated,This movie was not nearly as funny as I thought it would be.... But that is just my personal opinion...
3,Just disappointed,The previews were fine but the feature presentation had a problem. I need to return it and I just didn't want that extra burden. I always buy from amazon and will continue!
2,Cheap humor,"Mix of boring, offensive, immature, with a few good laughs. With so many great movies available, I wish I hadn't wasted my time with Ted."
2,Great acting but to much foul language,Wahlberg did a great job acting this part but I didn't think it was as funny as led to believe. It's like hearing a joke and waiting for the punch line that never comes. And the language does not always have to be so foul for it to be good:(
3,Ted - It Was ok,"The movie was funny but from all the reviews I expected to see a much funnier movie. I'm glad I did not go out and buy this one, not worth the cost."
2,Meh...,"Not as bad as I expected but that's not really saying a lot. If you're a Family Guy fan, you might like it more, but I'm not a fan of that show."
1,Ted is a stinker,I typically like guy movies. Loved all the Will Ferrell movies and the like. This movie was disappointing. I could not get past the fact that Teds voice was Peter from family guy. All the same gags were thrown in like they do In Family Guy. Not original or funny.
2,Save yourself 2 hours,This movie is not what it was hyped up to be. Not as funny as people mentioned and it was a long movie that just continued to drag on and on. Save yourself time and money and skip on this.
2,Ted -- Boring and Disturbing.,"Why would anyone think this movie is funny? A man with a pot smoking foul mouth talking teddy bear; they are both 5 year olds but at least the teddy bear looks like he might be five. I can't believe the cast actually thought this was a good idea, at least I hope they got paid well. And MacFarlane what was he smoking when he wrote this?"
5,funny,"was a funny funny movie got it based on the hype and it was worth it, if u think you want to buy it buy it"
3,"A little predictable, but good overall.","If you're a Family Guy fan this movie would probably be a 4 or 5 star rating for you. Stop reading, go watch this film.Ok, now that they're gone, I'll speak to everyone else. There were some genuinely laugh out loud parts, but overall if you're not a fan of Seth MacFarlane and his other work then you'll probably be disappointed by this. The editing was a little awkward at times, the story doesn't build a ton of momentum, and the Flash Gordon bit is a little overplayed."
2,Thought it would be funnier,It looked pretty funny for the first 20-30 minutes but got lame fast. It should have been more about the bear and less about relationships.
2,Crass and stupid,"Just like Family Guy, crass and stupid humor that only is good for a bunch of uneducated small town dummies."
4,very funny,"Funny and entertaining...definitely worth the $3.99. Probably would have been a little disappointed in paying $10 at the theater, but for a streaming home movie, it's worth it...I am a big Family Guy fan...I think that helps in this case."
1,Even the rated version was incredibly obscene,"I watched barely 1/4 of it. My husband watched a little more than that. It had more f bombs than any other movie you could possibly imagine. I was prepared for some nastiness but thought since it was the rated one it would have been a bit better.....wrong. Even IF I blurred out the vulgar in it, it wasn't too incredibly funny. It could have been a great movie if they didn't make it entirely for drunk young fools!"
5,something for the kid in some of us,"Seth mcfarlane continues to get me cracking up with Ted. From the get go, we're treated to his brand of humor when the narrator begins in the classic Christmas story style, then suddenly becomes this brutally honest and cynical sort of character. Brilliant from the get go, I'd suggest this to those of us who still laugh at fart jokes."
2,ok movie,A good movie to watch if your looking to kill some time...............would not watch again........A one hitter quitter......not for kids ...
3,Not what I had hoped for.,A little disappointed. Seth MacFarlane never misses on Family Guy. This film was not as funny as a regular episode of that weekly program.
4,a tribute to friendship,"this movie is a tribute to friendship, it teach us to be better people, to keep our promises, to give value to the stuff that really matters."
4,More than entertainment.,Ted is more than endearing entertainment. It provides a lesson to all about the maturing process and love. I highly recommend this movie to all.
3,It was ok,It seems that most of the funniest parts were included in the advertisements. If I would have been upset if I paid to see it in the movies. However it's worth the 1.99 to see it on Amazon.
5,Well worth the watching,"I never would have ""picked"" this movie, if a friend of mine hadn't sugguested it. It's a good story (some adult language and situations, so it's NOT for children). Delves into coming of age and relationships .... Highly recommend."
3,Just Ok,a few funny parts and a decent story but could of been better. It was a cute movie to take a chick
3,Some Funny Parts,"It's crude and kind of cute all at once. Not for kids! It's a typical stoner flick, not much of a plot, but a few laughs."
3,Not as funny as it looks,This is not the super funny movie that it was thought to be. All the funny parts are in the commercials. Wait til it hit Netflix.
2,A few Laughs,"I was hoping this would be better than it was, I'm a big fan of Family Guy and raunchy comedies. Ted attempted to be a raunchy comedy but it ended up being cheesy."
3,Pretty funny and worth watching,"Rather formulaic, but it's got enough Family Guy-style humor (and fighting!) to set it apart from other comedies. I'd recommend it."
3,First half very good second half ok,The first half of the movie had alot of funny parts and it is one of the few movies that both me and my wife laughed at. On the other hand the second half of the movie seemed to kind of drag and didn't move quick enough. It also go a little too sappy for me probably why my wife liked it so much.
3,It was alright,"I actually was expecting a way more funny movie... Sad that most funny parts are shown during previews and then when you watch the actual movie, you feel like you have already seen it just based off watching so many previews."
3,Funny at times,"Had a few good laughs, story line somewhat predictable Reasonable entertaining definitely not something children should see but that should be self explanatory."
4,Too Funny!,I will never look at my teddy bear the same way again! I recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor!
1,Horrible!,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Watched in on video...now my brain hurts...not funny at all, big disappointment."
1,really?!!,I'm at a loss for words.... I am unable to figure out who the target audience is here. Can't believe I spent money for this.
1,Very disappointed,"I thought it was stupid. Great cast, just needed better script. Had some good moments but, not to watch again."
4,TED belongs in the R-rated comedy Pantheon,"I missed TED during its original theatrical run, but I'm glad I finally got to watch it as a rental -- this is a movie I'll definitely buy on Blu-ray or DVD for the permanent collection. I'm not a huge fan of FAMILY GUY and other Seth MacFarlane productions -- he's *way* too hit-or-miss, IMHO -- but he got things *really* right with TED.There were moments during this movie that had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe or see through the tears in my eyes. Furthermore, anyone who was in grade school at the time FLASH GORDON: THE MOVIE came out in the late 1970s/early 1980s (and loved it, un-ironically!) will *treasure* TED for reasons I won't go into any further here (but trust me -- for those reasons alone, this movie is worth watching).This might not've been a home run in any other ballpark, but in Fenway Park with its short left field, MacFarlane hits a home over the Monster. :-)"
3,Moments of Hilarity,"I laughed out loud during moments of this movie. Unfortunately, those moments were few and far between. I wanted to love this movie! It had too much seriousness thrown into what I thought was going to be a laugh out loud, vulgar movie."
5,Haven't laughed so hard in years!,"If you're a fan of Seth MacFarlane, you'll love it. I think it was stretched a bit too far to make a full blown movie, but it's totally worth it. It was so funny I'm looking forward to buying the blu-ray to watch the outtakes."
2,Juvenile,"I watched this at the insistence of my 17 year old son. He liked it. I didn't. Probably not the movie's fault. I, hopefully, was not its target audience. If I was, It doesn't deserve the 2 stars."
3,"Well, you can watch it with yourr girlfriend at least....","Not really any funnier than an episode of family guy. If, like me, you were hoping for an uncensoried journey into the perversities of McFarlin's mind, you'll probably be a little let down."
4,lol funny i havent laugh like that in a long time.,i want every body too see this movie funny as hell. mark whaberg is funny and milla khunuz is sexy funny
2,Weird,Combine a weird Whalburg forcibly funny and the main characters from family guy on a vulgar rated R script and a forced love story. Not a very good movie...
2,Sub par,"Seth McFarlane has done a great job with Family Guy. Unfortunately, a feature length movie needs more than a 30 minute plot. Ted is a one trick pony that drags on."
5,Great Movie,Not for kids but a great movie for a comedy. A talking teddy bear is funny on its own and just the things he does makes this one of my favorite movies.
3,Depends on who you are,Funny....somewhat raunchy .....the 8 year olds were a little confused and put off by it. lolMy Mennonite neighbors thought it was a disney production.
3,Peter Griffin,I couldn't watch this without thinking of Peter Griffin and Family Guy. Seth Macfarlane really needs to get some voice actors for his movies and shows so all the characters don't sound exactly the same. The critics all say this is the funniest movie of all time. Obviously those critics are all 13 year old boys.
3,Funny,Interesting direction for a movie now a days. Very creative and funny. Worth watching at least once. Don't let the kids watch due to alot of swearing and sexual behavior.
4,funny!,I thought it could have been a little funnier...but still very funny! Can definitely tell it is a seth mcfarlane movie...hints of family guy style comedy everywhere. Overall good flick
2,Stupid,Could not wait for it to end. :( Thought it would be funny and it just turned out to be really strange. Some funny parts but over-all...boo.
1,Don't spend your time,"Initially, the visual of the bear walking and talking is funny. Then the movie just goes for the lowest common denominator jokes and is gross and predictable."
4,wicked funny,"Being from the Boston area, I know people like Ted so it's not hard to imagine a fuzzy cuddly teddy bear growing up in East Boston or North shore would turn out like this- it's like our own Jersey shore. Hysterically funny scenes and situations, a great story, a little crude (adult humor), nothing is sacred, I loved it."
2,not my cup of tea.,"a little more raw than I expected. I suppose I will have to be more conscious of the unrated label. some funny parts, though."
2,Adult only,I found this movie a little disgusting and the thought of a filthy mouth teddy bear beyond the boundries of acceptable entertainment. Mark Wahlberg could have passed on this one.
1,more Seth McFarland.,"I am a huge mark Wahlberg fan, so I watched it. But it was pretty much family guy on the big screen. I love crude humor, but I also like comedians that change it up a but, also. McFarland makes me laugh the first 15minutes of the movie, and the rest of the movie was mildly interesting at best. I would have not watched all of it if I was not able to watch mila kunis."
3,Ruxpin Gone Wild,The premise of the movie was a great idea. The follow through a little less than desired. But it passed the time. My only real problem was that I kept thinking of Brian the dog from Family Guy every time the bear talks. If you got time to kill this will do it
2,Ehhh,"Every person I've talked to who has seen this loved it. But, after I watched it I couldn't decide whether I hated it or liked it. It definitely gave me a couple laughs, but I feel like I wasted a couple hours of my life."
5,unbelievably funny,it has a very simple plot but at the same time very very funny definitely a must see if your fan of Family Guy or any of his other animated series
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,The bits you see in the shorts are all the funny bits in the movie.Sorry but its not really that funny IMO.
3,Ehhh,I watched this one Saturday when I was home alone. This definitely isn't anything you want to watch with the kids around. It was ok for a rainy Saturday afternoon and there's nothing else on tv. There were funny moments but it wasn't consistently funny. It'll cure boredom for a while.
4,Hilarious!,I would never have watched this unless it had been referred to me - it was awesome. Hilarious and very well done - not what you would expect at all. Worth the rental for sure.
5,Ted the movie.,The best comedy movie. But not one for the kids thats for sure. I would recommend this comedy to anyone without children.
4,Pretty funny,Kept me entertained. This is a good movie it you really don't want to have to think and rant a couple laughs
3,It is Okey,"I am not very impressed with the movie, my brother watched it three times in movie theater but I am glad I did not waste my money on it when it was showing in movie theater"
3,Ted,"It was a little on the dirty side rather than just being funny like I expected the movie to be. If I would have known it was going to be like that, I would have purchased it."
2,terrible,"I wanted so much to love this movie and was excited to rent it. It was not at all what I was hoping for. A little funny, but still hard to get through."
4,surprisingly funny,"someone else wrote cogently , ""funny with heart"" and I agree. It was ridiculously stupid in some scenes (that poop in the living room) but LOL funny in many others. And it did have love in it that wasn't too trite. I recommend."
5,TED,THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY AS HECK. I WASNT TO SURE ABOUT IT. BUT AFTER WATCHING IT AND WATCHING AGAIN THERE IS SOME VERY FUNNY STUFF IN IT
2,this was not funny at all,I had heard this was super funny and it was not good and was really not funny at all. I was disappointed.
2,Dumb,"I was looking forward to watching this movie and was expecting it to be silly. But, it was too silly to the point of stupid. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this one."
4,Hilarious!,"Oddly funny. And Mila Kunis is in it. Duh. If you're not a fan of odd humor, don't watch it if you are, watch it twice."
3,"not bad but,","Not a bad movie but, it's just something not right about a talking teddy bear but, plenty of good jokes and the humor only Seth can deliver."
5,Ted,"I saw Ted in the unrated version and I laughed my butt off watching it all the way through, who knew with a couple of Family Guy veterans including Seth McFairlane being the writer, producer, director and the voice of Ted come along to make this an unexpected comedy smash hit about a bear that is a bong-smoking, womanizing, Sam Jones Flash Gordon-loving, foul mouthed talking teddy bear that people can love! Amazing! Congratlations hosting the Oscars, Seth and for your unexpected Oscar Nomination for Best Original Song!"
3,"It's About a Talking Teddy Bear, What Do You Expect?","A few laughs, emphisis on few. Sam Jones was funny, the bear had a few te he's here and there, but that was about it."
4,A great laugh for adults,I love Mark Walberg!! Glad to him play this role. I really enjoyed the movie. It kept me laughing and also had a good story I even wanted to cry towards the end. I wont ruin it in chase u haven't seen Ted. The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars because of by promotion of Ted and him being a Teddy bear my 4 year old wanted to watch. Of coarse he didn't but I wish they would have made it known how graphic it is and language. Otherwise great funny movie. Watch but not with kids under 16-18 yr old. :)
3,Could have been better.,"It was funny but somehow for what ever reason, I was expecting more. It was good for a free rental."
2,Not impressed,Maybe two funny parts in the whole thing. I wouldn't watch it again and feel like it was a waste of money.
3,It's ok...cute and kind of funny.,"Ted was a cute movie, and it had some funny moments. Overall, it is just one of those very predictable romantic comedies. I kind of expected it to be a little funnier and less sappy. I am not sure the ""HD"" is worth the extra $1.00."
3,Dumb... predictable,"A few laughs - but the novelty of the talking teddy bear wears off quickly and it becomes a standard, predictable story line."
2,Awful,I am sorry that I actually paid money to see this movie. It was pointless and not entertaining.I do not recommend this movie.
2,Trite,"Seth McFarlane has really re-defined animation for television with ""Family Guy,"" going where even the Simpsons would not dare tread. His transition into the big screen does not work well, and ""Ted"" is a mindless and trite extended sitcom. Actually, it would be entertaining if it were an extended sitcom -- in fact, it's just a childish concept desperately searching for a meaningful plot.If you've watched ""Family Guy"" enough times, you'll find the jokes here the same-old same-old. There's a lot of gay jokes, and you'll hear all the familiar voices. Imagine Brian the dog as now Ted the teddy bear, and that's the whole movie."
2,D-uuuuummmm.,"I like dumb movies but this was very disappointing because they tried to get too serious. Acting was okay, not great. It is like when someone is joking but if falls flat because they make it too personal?? The movie is just Bad. The part where you cry over the death of the teddy? Please... It was far too intense for a FUN and DUMB movie."
1,Total Disappointment,"If there was an option for 1/2 star that would have been better. I had such high hopes for this movie but it failed miserably. Don't get me wrong, there are some funny parts. If you watch the unedited trailer, you are all set, no need to watch the movie. It was slow and the jokes seemed fragmented. I'm a huge Family Guy fan and Seth McFarlane fan. however, the over the top, way too many, shock-humor moments were just way too much. Too many, too often and honestly, just not funny. Wahlberg was terrible. The only good thing about this movie is being able to look at Mila Kunis...that is until I stopped watching 2/3 through."
2,Wow...,"Although I can't remember the name of the movie off the top of my head, Ted is extremely similar to that movie with the pot-smoking alien voiced by that fat guy with curly hair from ""Knocked Up."" A pot smoking teddy bear that cusses...what a novel idea. Smart on behalf of the producers, don't get me wrong, since they were smart enough to know that making a bear hang out and curse all day would be eaten up by the American movie-going public. I wish a giant robot had stuck its wiener in the bear, that would have been awesome."
1,TED,"Neither myself or my husband could deal with more than 1/2 hour of the vulgar language. About every other word was a swear word plus a lot of sexual references. This movie could have been down without the vulgar language, etc. I would never want my grand children or children to watch this movie."
3,pretty funny at times,"It had it's moments, but overall it was pretty much family guy. go figure. still funny to watch at least once though"
4,Hilarious,The movie plays with your emotions but overall its a comedy. I had a hard time at first separating Ted from Peter from family guy since Seth plays his voice but as the film went on I got over it. That is the only reason for the four star rating otherwise great movie it wasn't all given away in the trailers like most movies are.
1,Pathetic movie,not worth the watch at all.do not waste your time on this.too profane for a small teddy bear
5,GREAT!,Downloaded this item without a hitch. Everything went great! Wish I was given moree than 48 hours to watch it at that price though.
3,Good,I thought the fight scene between Ted and wahlbergs character was very funny.. It showed that Ted could take care of himself..too much vulgarity but I did order an unrated version
3,It was entertaining enough,I thought the movie would be funnier. Had some good moments but just an ok movie. I liked the cameos and a fan of Mark Walberg- creative plot.
2,Not Worth Renting,Stupid. I really Can't believe that Mark Wahlberg or Mila Kunis agreed to even be in this movie. I only gave it a shot because Mark was in it...
3,nasty,dirty not what I expected although funny not anything for any person under 21 in my opinion my boyfriend thought it was hilarious I was mostly shocked but its worth watching once
2,Don't waste ur time,If teddy bears dropping f bombs and other profanity is funny go for it. Could have been a cute movie with out all that. Would not waste my time on this one.
3,Not as funny as expected,"The movie had a little too much drug references in it for my liking. I expected some bad language, some sexual content but wasn't ready for all the drug references. It was good move to rent, glad I didn't go to the theater to watch it."
3,Funny but beware who you watch the movie with,"The movie was entertaining and was like watching an extended family guy. There was a lot of recreational drug use, some teddy bear sex, so be wary of who you watch the movie with."
3,Funny movie not for Kids,"Saw it once, would recommended for a good laugh. Glad I did not pay full price for this at the theater."
4,not for kids,little more cussing than i thought but it was good just not for kids as i thought it would be a cute movie
3,Joke is on us,"It has its moments, but the ones you don't care for out wieght the good. Just dumb humor, I should have known."
5,Great Product!,"I have a Cuisipro Course Grater that I really love, so decided to order the 2-way Grater and love it just as much. The long handle makes it easy to hold while grating and the length of the actual grater part seems to be just the right size, not too big and not too small. They both are easy to clean and have a plastic slide-on protector so you don't hurt yourself while looking for another utensil in your kitchen drawer. I bought this second grater also because the grater part is made in the USA and that is a big factor in all my purchases. Overall, they are great products!"
2,Strictly for kids who just hatched out from the shell of animations,"The first five minutes were enough for me to stop the movie and sell it off. Only thing i liked about this movie was i could sell it instantly for more price then i spent. This movie has been overrated.There are some good J movies like Samurai Fiction, that are cool, funky and hip being period movies the same time; but this movie has missed the target trying to be one of them."
2,Low budget thriller,A low budget horror-action thriller that left me unsatisfied. I had trouble connecting with either of the main characters. The story became progressively murkier with its attempts at plot twists and such. Can't recommend this for purchase.
2,Good vs. Evil,"Versus is a film about the struggle good between evil, and it begins with two escaped convicts that are running to a meeting spot in a forest. What is unknown to the convicts is that the forest is cursed by wicked magic which leads to a struggle for survival. As the struggle begins, it is evident that their actions dictate what is good and evil, however, sometimes it is a little more ambiguous as to what is evil and what is good. Versus is a film filled with violence and death that keeps repeating itself throughout the film, which gets to the point monotonously. Nevertheless, there is an underlying fundamental idea that the actions make the person which can help clarify the ending of the film. In the end, the film stretches out becoming monotonous and boring which results in a rather mind-numbing cinematic experience."
2,DISSapointing!!,"Versus is basically a evil dead/highlander wannabe and unfortunetly a bad one at that, the entire movie looks like it was shot somewhere in central park NYC. . it's like watching a 90 minute BALZAC video (BALZAC is the japanese version of the MISFITS) the english dubbing stinks and the zombies are boring if uninspiring. and the lead actor looks too much like johnnny depp for a second i thought it was actually him before he got the role of Pirates from the carribean.the ending wasn't too bad though.there are far better japanese movies available; i.e. JUNK,BATTLE ROYALE, PRINCESS BLADE, RETUNER..you get what i'm saying.."
5,Must have!!!,"What can be said that hasn't already been said about Versus?Altough you have to check your brain at the door, this film is non stop action and in my opinon possibly the best action film from Japan in many years. Directed by Ryuei Kitamura, who recently directed Godzilla Final Wars. This was his first film with a budget, and also his best. Very recommened. This Tokyo Shock 2 disc set is also fantastic. Thank you Tokyo Shock for treating this film right!"
3,Gangsters AND Zombies! FUN!,"Ok, a Japanese film, full of action, blood and ZOMBIES! What's not to like? Really simple plot involving some gamgsters going to a forest with some hostages. 'Course, the forest is cursed. Then....ZOMBIES! They arrive to ruin the gamgsters day.The director of this film is HUGE in japan and has done other movie simular to this. The DVD is sharp and the dub is good. Maybe it's just me and am tiring of the genre. Enjoyable and well done, but I could only give it 3 stars."
3,Would have been 5 stars...,"... if I had watched the unrated version, I'm sure. (Thank god I only rented.) You can see and hear where the cuts are made in this R-rated version. It was highly annoying! As for the film itself, those who compare it to Evil Dead are spot-on the money. The film is stylish, gory and funny. The story is indecypherable, but who cares when a film looks this good? I'm gonna HAVE to buy the unrated version. If you loved Evil Dead and/or Dead Alive, you will love this film."
2,Dissapointment,"I bought the Special Edition, as it said it has DTS 5.1. Well it doesn't. The SE packaging simple. The extra disc is in a lose paper satchel.With all he hype, I expected a great movie. It was ok, watchable. But definaltley not worth the extra 10USD for the SE.The story is simplistic, and I was dissapointed by this film. But everyone has their own opinion."
1,Embarrassingly awful.,"I rented this, based on the quote on the front cover from Moriarty of Ain't it Cool News. This ""film"" is unbelievably bad. There's no plot, and it looks like the efforts of a couple of teenagers with a video camera trying to shoot a ""cool, violent"" movie. The characters posture pathetically, and it's about as stylistically interesting as...a bunch of teenagers shooting a home movie. The dubbing is atrocious (and like everything else, sounds like the efforts of...a bunch of teenagers shooting a home movie), but subtitles wouldn't have saved it.After watching it I thought there was no way Moriarty could have liked it, so I searched Ain't it Cool News for that quote. It turns out the quote was from someone writing in to the site. Moriarty prefaced the comment by basically saying he couldn't stand the movie. It might be great as a Mystery Science Theater 3000 film, were that still around, but aside from that, stay away."
1,Why can't anyone dub a voice in this day and age,What the heck is up with the dubbing in this film? I couldn't bear it and unfortunately have to say this is the worse and most annoying film I have seen in a long time.Maybe if you turn off the sound and play the text instead.Should get a razzie award for 'unintentionally funny'
1,Horrible....Horrible....Horrible,"This movie is simply 2 hours of 10 skinny guys doing silly Kung Fu fighting in a haunted forrest. The worst thing about this movie is that there is absolutely no story!! I repeat, no story!! The viewer is thrown into a forest and watches as a few minor incidents lead to punching and kicking.The zombies in the haunted forest are not even scary. They hardy attack the bad guys, the zombies main purpose is to be used as shooting targets for the bad guys.I recommend you buy ""The Returner"" or ""The One"". Those are two excellent martial arts movies. Waaaaaay better than Versus."
1,What a mess,"I'm confused as to how anyone could possibly mistake this mass of garbage as being a decent film. Poor acting, lousy score, cheesy dialogue, weak special effects... I could go on. The ""coolest"" thing about this movie is the cover of the DVD case. If you're interested in foreign sci-fi try The Returner, Casshern or Steamboy. This waste of celluloid isn't even worth a rental let alone a purchase."
3,Laugh Your Socks Off,"I went into this movie with two friends and a friend's friend's recommendation that it's the BEST movie of all times. After about 10 minutes into the movie (very slow, and pointless dialog which doesn't get any better for the rest of the movie) and we could not help but laugh at its incredibly horrible directing, dialog, and plot twisting. It's so bad, that it's funny. In the end, we decided it was a comedy."
3,only get this if your out of japanese martial arts flicks to buy,"It wont make u feel bad having spent some of life's precious minutes watching this...however,just buy something else,unless you can get a cheap copy.The story is not to interesting the action is basic.It resembles more a movie written by a Japanese person but filmed by an American with American producers.Not a bad movie but questionable as to being ""good"".Picture a jailbreak duo who crosses path with dime a dozen gangsters in an ""enchanted forest"" where the dead become the undead and the plot only exists to end the movie not explore an idea.Cheesy action flick that makes an attempt at some humor.Unless you dont mind mindless pseudo-action dribble...dont buy it.Once again,unless its realy cheaply priced."
3,"Looks Awful, Good Story","A more accurate title for this film would have been ""The Blair Matrix Project."" It really brings up some serious issues and makes you think...""Could I have made this movie in my backyard with some friends when I was in highschool?"" That being said if you can sit through the almost endless (and sometimes pointless) encounters of the main characters and make it to the final scene the movie becomes quite interesting."
1,Less than what expected,"The movie did not meet my expectations. Was excited to receive it after reading reviews, but fell short of what I expected. Not best quality, acting, nor fighting scenes. Fell asleep first time I tried to watch it; ended up giving it away. Not worth the money. Shinobi is a far better movie."
4,FUN!,"Ferocious and slick, over the top gory, ...funny! This film needs no introduction or apologies, go out and buy/rent it NOW. I noticed that people compared it to ""Evil Dead"" ... WRONG! Some folks think that ""JUNK"" is better ... WRONG! Maybe if you have limited exposure to extreme films, you might make these comparisons. The hardcore folks are looking for Barrel Entertainment or Unearthed film releases, but this is not that kind of movie. This movie is more fun than 95% of Shriek Show or Grind House releases and you can forget about the major players from the US. The extreme martial arts movies like ""Riki Oh - The Story of Riki`"" can't even come close. The plot is reasonable and requires you to keep watching to unfold. If you like gore, you will have no problem keeping up with the action...."
4,Slick Flick,This is a pretty slick zombie flick. What it lacks in substance it makes up for in style. The actors perform well considering the plot is a little weak. It seemed like all they did was walk and talk in circles. These guys also never heard of keeping the guns of the people they bury. Besides those minor points this is a great movie full of frantic action and comedy. The DVD is crystal clear with nice 5.1 sound for Japanese with subtitles. There's not a whole lot of extras on the directors cut but it's still worth the purchase. This is a must own for Zombie fans.
1,Suckfest!!,"This must be the most horrendus movie Ive ever seen. The acting, the blood and the sfx could all have canged roles in this suckfest of a movie.Asian movies like this gets to much attension - rather buy Ong-Bak, KungFu Hustle, Shaolin Soccer, Drunken Master 2...VERSUS - U GOT ME DEPRESSED!!!"
2,Pretty crappy movie,"This movie felt long. The special effects and filmwork were pretty bad. The acting was even worse. The voice-over actors were bad and the subtitles were generally too fast to read those and watch in Japanese.I'm a fan of this genre of movie usually and I thought this would be a good one - but this is one to pass on, especially considering how much it costs."
5,Good wholesome fun,This is a very fun and enjoyable movie. This is the type of movie that you put in the DVD player after feeling depressed after watching Schindlers List or if your having a tough time in your life. It moves fast and you don't have to put a lot of emotions into it. Just sit back and prepare to laugh at the violence that is thrown across the screen. Watching this movie reminds me of Riki-Oh or Meet the Feebles in the way that you can just relax and let all your troubles leave your mind for awhile and just let the greatness of this movie take you over.
1,Very cheesy!,"Did not care for this film. It was very corny and I could not take it seriously at all. I know it is a zombie flick, but there was no level of realism at all."
3,Evil Dead Comparison = Blasphemy,"If you've read the other reviews you already know the basics of this film. Its a kung fu flick with some zombies, over-the-top gore, horrible over-dubbing, annoying humor, fist fights, gun fights, and sword fights. The comparisons to Evil Dead, Reservoir Dogs, et cetera should cease. This film is nothing like either movie. The fights are decent, the gore is fun, but that still leaves this movie needing more to be taken seriously. If you're looking for a fun, dumb, gore-filled kung fu flick then get Versus."
4,Evil Dead with guns & swords!,"Simple review:1. Takes place in well-shot woods2. Gore, gore, gore3. Guns4. Inventive camera work5. Kung-FuWhy 4 stars & not 5?Evil Dead worked because of likeable Ash (he made us laugh, and therefore care for him). No one in this film does that. Pity.Let's keep our eyes open for Versus 2!"
5,a must!,"this is a favorite movie in our houshold! i got it at an amazing price, and i got it on my boyfriends b day! awesome timing as well."
4,Get ready for entertainment,"I lived in Japan for almost four years; so there was time for me to come to appreciate Japanese filmmaking. Versus was really popular there, however I did not get a chance to see the film until I returned to the US recently.I did not know what to make of it at first; but I kept watching, because hey, it's a Japanese film. I laughed throughout the whole movie, from the over-eager and psychopathic hitmen to zombies shooting guns, I really couldn't get enough. I have to agree that the voice-overs were horrible, but that is exactly what made it even more entertaining. I must say the cinematography was brillant and the ending is mind-blowing... although it does leave you with one big question. I highly recommend it."
2,Just OK,"I found this book very slow in the beginning with a very complicated plot.It ended strong, but overall I would rate it just OK."
3,Beach Music,"I enjoyed this book, it was harder to get into than South of BroadI especially was almost put off by all the rage that was displayed in the first part of the book...took me longer to decide that I did want to read the book."
3,a sizable read,"Shyla McCall jumps of a bridge, instantly fracturing a community; creating a schism between two families.Beach Music traces the journey of Jack McCall, the widower, and his daugther, Leah, from Rome, where he attempts to hide from his family, to South Carolina, where he must face his greatest fear--his past.Weaving together episodes from significant events from the past (Vietnam war, WW I and II, etc.), Pat Conroy contrives a delectable tale. The dialogue is lively, and George Fox's monologue was the high point, for me.Nevertheless, the book suffers from obesity.Not taking anything away, Beach Music is excellent, especially for those who have spare time."
4,Intense with twists-with an all too happy and tidy ending!,"Hard to put down...many twists and layers of time and persons. Emotional and complicated, yet easy to read and follow. For such an intense and deep book, I found the ending too unbelievable, pehaps even shallow. Every problem is solved and everyone is happy. Even 20 year old grudes and hatred/fears from concentration camps. Makes you feel good, yet is also a let down for such a wonderfully suprising, emotion laden and intense book."
1,Flowery prose finally gets the best of Conroy,"A fan of Conroy's books, including ""The Prince of Tides"" and ""The Water is Wide"", I found this book to be terribly disappointing. Though I admire his ability in previous works to mold sentences that beautifully tell of his southern homeland and the characters within it, his flowery prose runs wild here. Certain passages, though describing a depressing chain of events, are downright laughable. Gay Talese's editing contributes to a lack of continuity and plausibility, resulting in a work that is maudlin and hackneyed to the fullist. Check out other Conroy...this is definately his worst."
1,Incredibly Unrealistic Characters,"Conroy's habit of making characters with mental problems into tragic, yet charismatic and magical entities is beyond annoying. From what I know of the families of schizophrenics, caring for afflicted individuals goes a tad beyond the fond headshaking and smiling tolerance that Conroy's characters indulge in when dealing with John Hardin. Totally unrealistic. And speaking of unrealistic, why not make Jack's daughter a REAL 6-year-old (who occasionally whines, has tantrums and spills milk) rather than a beatific, Yoda-type character who is wiser than every adult surrounding her?"
2,"Ehh, not my cup of tea.","Conroy's a bit too emotional for my taste and he tends to overwrite. I enjoyed The Great Santini a lot, but this one didn't do much for me. There's one chapter, when a few teenagers get stranded at sea on a motorboat, that's great. And his portrayal of southern life is cool, but I wasn't crazy about this one overall."
3,Not his best,"I loved The Prince of Tides. In that work of Conroy's, I found the writing to be beautiful and smooth. The plot was amazing and drew the reader in. That's why I was so surprised about Beach Music. While the writing still had its moments, I found the plot to be unrealistic and ""out there."" It kept twisting and turning and getting further from what Conroy does best-- write about the south, his childhood, and things he is familar with. The frequent dialogues between the brothers in the book seemed like contests to see who could be the most sarcastic, and didn't really add to the story at all (just took up space). I love some of Conroy's earlier work, but this didn't measure up. Of course, he still gets three stars because no matter how poor the plot, he can still write beautiful passages that make the book at least salvagable."
1,I'm going to be ill,"Pat Conroy's Beach Music would be a lot shorter if he cut out all of the adjectives and ridiculous similes. With the exception of the descriptions of the Holocaust, I found the story and characters to be unbelievable, over the top, insipid, melodramatic. The book certainly provoked an emotional response - I kept wanting to throw it across the room. Conroy must make himself sick writing all that saccharine prose. BLECH!"
1,I don't get it?,I've failed to finish two books in my life. This is one of them. I loved Prince of Tides and The great Santini. I closed this mess after 300 pages of diologe.How could this book get 4 or 5 stars? I don't get it!
5,BEST BOOK EVER,If I could choose one book I total was in love with this would be it. I just finished and loved it. By the way i'm 13 so I definatly have to say by it.!!!!
4,Great Book!,I really enjoyed this book! The author is a great storyteller.....it was like reading many stories within stories. The only part of the book that I did not like is the chapter describing the father in law's life in the concentration camp.....too graphic....too much.....I just do not enjoy reading about horrific events even if I know it happened in real life. Other than that one chapter I really enjoyed the book.
2,Disappointing!,"I found that I couldn't even finish this book. The author has a beautiful narrative style, but I found nothing to like in any of the characters in this book. Jack was a whiner, his mother was a melodramatic pain in the butt, and the daughter was just TOO TOO precocious. The alcoholic father was a caricature. The draft dodger turned priest was just TOO noble. Everyone in this book was some kind of extreme. Enough already... if I want this kind of story, I'll watch for a movie-of-the-week. There are far better writers out there."
1,Painfully slow,"This is the first book I have read by Pat Conroy, and more than likely it will be the last. Actually I didn't read the whole thing because it was so drawn out and dull. Trying to get into this book was almost painful. Save your money."
3,I didn't think it was his best.,"I'm a big Pat Conroy fan. All of his other books were great, Prince of Tides being the best. I've read it three times and enjoyed it every time. I believe that he is a true poet.I, too, thought that this book was too long. The portion of the book about the Holocost served no purpose, in my opinion. I appreciate the message but felt it was totally out of place.It was tough reading about all the disfunctional families. I guess that there are families like that but it sure isn't something that I knew about as a youngster. I had 2 brothers and 2 sisters and we have covered each others back our entire lives and we have had long lives!I think a more compact, shorter version would be more enjoyable.That being said, I can't wait for his next book.Oh, I meant to mention that I was given the book as a gift back in 1995. For some reason, it got stuck on the bookshelves (my wife did it, I think) and I just pulled it down about a month ago."
5,Wow! This is a great book,"This book has a lot of complex and varied story lines and connections. There is humor, drama, love, family quirks, and everything in between. I really enjoyed it. One of the best books I've ever read. Pat Conroy has the rare ability to articulate and describe people, thoughts, and things in a most captivating way. This is a book rich with unique characters I cared about. And when it was finished, I was sad because I had to leave that world and those characters with whom I had become so close. Highly recommend."
2,Not one of Conroy's best,"I was so excited that a new book by Conroy came out that I bought the hardcover edition-- and after I was finished, took it to a second hand bookstore to salvage what I could from it. Especially after reading ""The Lords of Discipline"" and ""The Prince of Tides"" this novel very disappointing. He needed a good editor to rein him in, and try to contain some of the story lines. In a way I think that Conroy was too ambitious-- there were probably two or three good novels contained within this one rambling plot."
2,Ridiculous melodrama,"I read this book after a friend highly recommended it. What a huge disappointment! I didn't find a single character believable, let alone likeable--and Lord knows there is a huge cast of characters in this book. Jack McCall's whiny ""my family ruined my life and I'm so bitter"" routine got old after the first couple of chapters. The story line is so wrought with over-the-top tragedy that I just couldn't get drawn into it. Several flashback sequences--particularly the suffering of the Jewish characters in Europe--added absolutely nothing to the story except bulk.I loved The Lords of Discipline and The Great Santini, but Pat Conroy has lost a fan with Beach Music."
5,Amazing!!,Pat Conroy never disappoints. I enjoy his books and this is one of my favorites. I can't wait for the next one!!
2,Not Prince of Tides,"While I consider The Prince of Tides to be the most magnificent, moving, involving book ever written, it has taken me over 2 years to finish Beach Music. The characters are remarkably one-dimensional, borderline comic (just look at all the male characters and see how easily you can describe each in ten words or less). Instead of a novel, the endless monologues and reflections on everything from the Holocaust to Vietnam read more like history, and forced down the reader's throat with only tangential relevance to the plots. The witless putdowns between the many characters (how many hundreds are there, by the way?) were sophomoric. And the endless references to how beautiful and handsome everyone was.. it was just too much. The survivors of wars and horror are merely caricatures that speak in 10-page paragraphs, truly boring the reader with way too much detail. What a disappointment."
4,Powerful Writing!,Conroy's writing is so effective that I started feeling suicidal. Much of this story is tragic. I had to take a break when only 1/3 finished because it was beginning to impair my well-being. I hope to get back to it after finishing some Evanovich fluff to lift my spirits.
5,800 Pages of Sheer Poetry,"Beach Music is for those who delight in words. With the artistry of Fitzgerald and Hawthorne, Conroy takes us on a journey through South Carolina as if we are a painter's brush gliding across canvas covered in the loveliest of colors. His imagery is exquisite! And the story! This novel shows, once and for all, that we are all products of the 1960s and the Vietnam War. His characters are linked to this most influential time in our history. The novel is engrossing and engaging, ultimately leaving the reader with a sense that he or she has been taken on a lovely, bumpy ride."
1,Can't bear to finish,I'm on page two hundred and this book is going nowhere very slowly. The characters are one-dimensional cliches and the dialogue is laughable. Conroy spends more words implying and contriving tensions than actually developing believable conflicts.
3,Conroy's descriptions flow like poetry but we don't need such detail on man's inhumanity to man.,"Pat Conroy's prose is a symphony often sparking the imagination, stimulating the emotions and at times evoking laughter through incongruous images and sarcasm. But he should have stuck to his insights and appreciation of life in the American South. I am not in denial of attrocities committed against the Jews in Germany and Poland. However page after page, after gory page narrating the grotesque inhumanity is overdone and insulting to me. At best it offends my sensitivity and at worst it is the reason I will burn this book rather than inflict those passages on others."
4,A perfect story to appreciate your own family idiosyncrasies,"I found this book very hard to put down. It was my first Pat Conroy book, but definately not my last. He caught my heart with his frustrations of family during a very difficult part of his life. Although it is a story of fiction, it relates to how even in real life, families can be very hurtful without even knowing it. I found Jack's initial response of not allowing his daughter the right to know her history very discerning. But then letting her daughter get to know her grandparents a great joy. I found reading about Jack's mother sharing the history and life of sea turtles with her grandaughter to be a beautiful way one's elders share life and the importance of preserving mother nature and her impeccable ways. I would recommend this book to anyone to appreciate how important family is no matter what baggage it carries, but appreciate what you have because you won't have it forever."
4,high marks for language and drama,"While I am completely taken with Conroys use of language, I am concerned that some readers think this is the best book American literature has to offer. Try some Hemingway and Fitzgerald for comparison. Conroy has a magical gift for metaphors and 'turning a phrase', but characters that seem critical drop out for years (and pages) only to reappear magically a few chapters later. The plot was very complex and dramatic. But the turning points and character motivations were not always clear. The dialog was excellent. The setting of the scene was descriptive and colorful. Overall I think the book is somewhat uneven. Mr. Conroy might consider working with a very strict, but sympathetic, editor"
3,Is Pat Conroy just writing the same book again and again?,"I'm a real fan of Mr. Conroy, but even I'm beginning to wonder if we're getting the same basic plot with every new Conroy book. You know, emotionally wrought man deals with history of his dysfunctional family.It even took two characters, McCall and Elliott, to cover the Conroy autobiographical character in ""Beach Music"".The mock trial was really contrived and unbelievable. Let's vent and all be buddies again.Come on, Pat, get over that rotten childhood and give us something new and refreshing."
5,Great Vacation Read,"You won't be disappointed in Beach Music. Engrossing novel dealing with suicide, relationships, family (it's all there) and the journey of Jack to find answers by searching through his past. Although some parts of the book seemed a bit long, I highly recommend this be on your list to read!"
1,100 pages of promise followed by 700 pages of drivel...,"I have to say this must be his worst book in my experience since it was so bad I couldn't finish it...and like an unwanted chore that really had to be done, I really, REALLY tried to finish it...but it finished by being chucked into the garbage...For 100 pages it is the beginning to an excellent book, then gets lost in a vague fog inhabited by two dimensional traumatized characters and a vague theme of meeting the most vile abusers in our lives and kissing them on both cheeks because they are us. If this book were a meal I would stick a finger down my throat and extract every word. This book is poison."
5,This is a wonderful narration of impossible relationships.,"Every impossible relationship, mother/son; father/son; brother/brother; father/daughter; husband/wife; mother/daughter; father/girlfriends; child/father's girlfriend...they're all resolved and everyone lives happily ever after. This book makes you feel good about everyone. Thanks, Mr. Conroy."
1,Trite crud for Danielle Steele fans.,"I should have known better. It was at the top of the New York Times best seller list. I guess when you appeal to that many people, you have to shoot for the lowest common denominator. More cliche-ridden than an Oliver Stone movie. An unfortunate waste of time"
2,"authors writing style kept me reading, but plot weak",This book was captivating and interesting to read but I kept on wondering where he was going. I kept on thinking...get to the point already. I think the book was too long at 800 pages and would have been a better read at 400 pages (-400 pages of dead wood).
3,Not Impressed!!,"Perhaps I had to high of hopes for ""Beach Music"". After all, I found ""The Prince of Tides"" to be exceptional. I could hardly wait for this book to be published. I wanted more of what I had in previous efforts by this author. I have to think the well was running dry on this one. This was just okay."
5,Wonderful,"Hysterically funny, terribly sad, ultimately life affirming. Conroy has the gift of making you care about his main characters while proving them imperfect and sometimes downright awful. Yet, you still understand them, root for them, and completely take interest in thier lives. If the characters don't do it for you, the descriptions of the Low Country will. No one who reads this book will ever look at a turtle the same way nor visit a beach or marsh without thinking about Jack and his family."
3,Loooong,I've heard several times this is a great book. Which it may be. It's over 700 pages. I'm half way through & really feel there is a ton of fluff that could totally be taken out which would make me want to read it more. He gets a bit too descriptive to where I just want to jump ahead or put it down. When I'm done(whenever that may be)perhaps I'll post a follow up. Happy reading!
4,Beach Music,THe book was in condition as described and arrived on time.A Great Read!Slow reading to devour each description of a Pat Conroy novel.
5,Beech Music,"The book arrived earlier than expected.Pat Conroy is one of my favorite authors and this book does not disappoint.Also, the price was right.I am a satisfied customer!"
5,Excellent purchase,"This book was delivered in timely fashion, in excellent, near new condition, as alleged. I couldn't be happier with the vendor. The fact that the book is wonderful and ""music to my ears"" is indeed a bonus!!!"
5,Captivating,"I am a sophomore in college and was assigned to read this book for my Introduction to Literature class. When I first saw the length of the book, I dreaded reading it. But as soon as I read the first paragraph, I was hooked. I couldn't put the book down and read it at every chance I got. I even found myself purposely reading ahead of the class assignment just so what we talked about in class would not tell me what happened before I got to it. I laughed and I cried. This book had every element of a good story and more. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is up for a good novel!"
1,"""Boring Music"" would be a better title","I wanted to like this book. Really. It was the selection of the month for my book club, it had come highly recommended by astute friends and most customer reviews were oozing with praise. I did NOT like ""Beach Music"" however, not even a eentsy-weentsy bit. Here're but a few of my quibbles with the book:. It's far too long and contains too many sub-plots. ""Succinct"" appears not to be an adjective Conroy understands.. The characters all are pulchritudinous. Ah, but to balance that, Conroy makes them all crazy and/or conflicted.. John Hardin, the brother with schizophrenia,is portrayed in the most demeaning, stereotypical manner. Conroy should be hung by his toenails for contributing to the misunderstanding of and stigma surrounding this serious mental illness.. The ""Purple prose"" becomes blatantly boring after a very short while. I truly am sorry I wasted so much time on this book."
1,There are better things to do with your time than read this!,"Reading these reviews makes me sad. This novel is truly bad and about 700 pages too long. It is about one-dimensional characters who are grown adults but cannot stop blaming their parents for being humans. The dialog is downright silly and embarrassing. The writing is honestly so verbose, its like someone vomited words over the pages. The forced silly imagery (he compares the sight of the Carolina marshes to table lines for heaven's sake) is something I would expect from a bad piece of high school writing. People there are good writers out there. This is NOT one of them. EXPECT MORE!"
4,A saga,"Another revealing coverage by Pat Conroy of Southern attitudes, negative & positive, lives & how each character is so strongly influenced by class, the military & education, or the lack thereof, written in his beautiful style."
5,Beach music,Pat Conroy is full of surprises in his books and I suspect he had some troubles in his family when he was young as it always comes back in his stories and quite vivid.
3,"Sometimes, less is more.","With ""Beach Music,"" Pat Conroy has written a good 600 page book that would have been a great 300 page book.I was instantly drawn into the story of Jack McCall and his young daughter Leah as they attempted to put the pieces of their lives together after his wife's suicide. I was, however, not as interested in the countless turns the story took away from that plot line. While the Holocaust, the Vietnam war, and the internal battle waged by misplaced southern Americans living in Rome are certainly interesting topics, I found that they diluted the story that I wanted to read.Without a doubt, Conroy's prose is impressive in it's style and pageantry. Now, if only it were more focused here...."
2,Disappointing. A real yawner.,"I am a huge Pat Conroy fan, therefore I was most disappointed in his latest novel. His beautiful way with words is unflagging, but the plot and characters left much to be desired. I kept plugging along, expecting the book to pick up and pull me in, until finally I had to give up. I just lost all interest. None of the characters was remotely likeable, and much of the dialogue was far fetched. Ponderous and dull, this book is a real yawner."
1,I was surprised at the language in this book.,"When you read a few pages and enjoy and book, or you go to a movie and get interested in the movie, and then they interject the vulgarity, that ends it for me. I do not use the Lord's name in vain, nor do I watch risque movies. Pat Conroy is a much better writer than this book!"
2,Too much description,A friend recommended this book to me and I was excited to read it. I read 150 pages and put it down. It was so detailed and maybe all those details will make sense later in the book but I couldnt keep reading to find out. I like a book that is more interesting.
2,pretty bad,"flowery, syrupy, overwritten. boorish despicable characters. painful, overwrought dialog. good god but conroy loves to wallow in maudlin family drama. this family was a cut and paste from the one in 'prince of tides'. one high point was the powerful sense of actually being in rome with the characters."
2,A real disappointmentI,"I just needed to aline the stars here. In this rambling story, the characters are not believable and not likeable. Leah, the child is like an adult with a child title, Jack is an adult still raging about his upbringing and you never know why. Every person is gorgeous. I urge you to read the other under-3 star reviewers for more articulation because I don't want to waste your time, repeating the same comments. It is unfortunate that this is the first Conroy book I have read because other reader's seem to love his other works and the possibility of reading those is wrecked for me."
5,LOVED this,"I've never read a Pat Conroy novel nor have I seen any of the adapted films. I stumbled across Beach Music in our shared library at work. Where some of the story was a bit ""out there"" (the Vietnam drama and the ensuing lockdown ""courtroom"" proceedings in particular), I found the book incredibly engrossing and completely enjoyable. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud regularly throughout a novel - and this is a huge novel. It sits among my top ten favorite books ever. I read this last summer and plan on reading it again very soon.On a side note, I was not impressed with Shyla and am puzzled with the main character's intrigue. Shyla came across as a liar, a cheater and, ultimately, a selfish bitch in leaving her baby daughter by means of a dramatic suicide. I couldn't understand any of the characters' fascination with her. Perhaps in my second go round I'll find something more to grip onto and make her more ""loveable""."
2,huge dissapointment,"This book is a huge dissapointment from the man who wrote""Lords"" etc. The main character was hiding out in Italybecause his family had apparently wounded him so. Then he goes back and after a few acidic exchanges everyone is friends again. What IS that?? The retelling of the holocaust story was well-handled but on the whole, only slightly better than a Jeffrey Archer novel."
1,Actually deserves negative stars,I find it hard to believe that anyone intelligent enough to log on to the internet would find anything good to say about this terrible novel. Please someone figure out how truly horrible this book actually is.
4,beach music,"Excellent book. Magnificient journey through the highlights of the second part of the twentieth century. Beautifully written, a real treat!"
5,The game isnt fair,In Pt2 we realize that Karma is a b*tch in more ways than one. The bond and love that was created in Pt1 ends in bloody mess and to top it off you are left wondering and having questions of what happens next which means Pt3 needs to made to let us know can the game ever be fair.
4,BLOODY MONEY 2,BOOK SENT TO INMATE IN FEDERAL PRISON - HAVE NO IDEA OF PACKAGING OR HOW HE WOULD RATE SAME OR IF BOOK HAS BEEN READ
4,Black Diamond Neutrino Carabiner,"I purchased these carabiners to use as part of my hammock suspension. As such, they have performed flawlessly during all the hangs I've used them on."
5,Great for hammocks,"Light weight and strong, I use these for quick setup of my hammock. Just tie them on and it's a quick connect."
5,This is the perfect carabiner for hammock use.,"Very light, really excellent quality alloy and made in the USA. Quite strong for many uses. I use mine for a hammock for backbacking. Black Diamond makes very excellent equipment, I recommend this carabiner."
5,Works great for my application.,"I purchased a pair of these to use for suspending my hammock between two trees in my backyard. They are very lightweight, seem very sturdy and work great for holding me up securely, with no fear of being dumped onto the ground while snoozing or getting in and out of my hammock. I'm not a rock climber and these are indeed made in China, so I don't know if I would trust the manufacturing quality control enough to save my life in a fall. When used in a non-life threatening scenario, such as for suspension in a hammock, I think they are excellent and would highly recommend them."
2,just wrong,It was just way to big. The pictures provided where very misleading. I wanted something small to hook my keys to in order to not have to fish for them in my purse. However this is HUGE. I could really go rock climbing with this if I wanted to.
4,Great for Camping or Emergency Bag,These are high quality and rather large but not overly large they have a strong hook latch instead of a locking latch. These are great for a camp trip to hold up the hammocks or hold down gear. I am pleased and I'm sure I'll find many uses for these. They are a bit costly but will do.
5,Good Stuff,"Bought these as a replacement for the ""carabiners"" that a swing-set company had included with their product.The Neutrinos fit perfectly and unlike the garbage that the swing-set included, these 'biners have held up beautifully - no deformation, solid engagement, etc."
2,MADE IN CHINA,"One of the main reasons I purchased this item was because the description said it was made in the USA. I received my Neutrino Black Diamond carabiners only to discover they are made in China according to the small paper tag attached to the carabiner. The product description needs to read ""Country of Origin: China"" NOT ""Country of Origin: United States"". But it's my fault I should have read all the reviews."
5,Strong and Light,I bought two of these to support by ENO Hammock. I am 200 lbs and they supported me and my hammock quite well. It is amazing how something this small can support a lot of weight.
1,grrr...,"This book was a waste of time. I am forced to read in my L.A. class and it is the most boring book I have ever read!!!!! I also have to do assignments along with this book. Grr...I'm not even half done with it! I have to finish the book now..But,....i gave it a star since the author put so much effort into this book and really worked hard on it as most authors do. But they could've done better by making this story a bit more interesting!"
4,sort of good,"I would recommend this book to others because it is very good. It also taught me some Civil War facts. The only thing I didn't like was it used a few swear words. The author did this to illustrate the language soldiers used in the Civil War. Other than that, it was a very good book."
3,"""suspensful""","I am reading this book for school and it's very interesting. It's about a boy who's dad went to fight, and came home wounded. He eventually died of the wounds, but as he was dying, he made his son promise that his son would not go and look for revenge against the Yankees. His son agrees, but then he gets an offer he can't refuse. He will get $400.00 for going and bringing food to them. He lies to his mom and says that there is no danger in it at all. But then he gets captured by a man named Cush. ...."
1,Never Received Book,Money was taking out of my account I waited the entire month of July for the Corn-Free Cookbook and Survival Guide: For the Corn-Intolerant and Corn-Allergic and NEVER received it. The seller never contacted me about any problems he/she just completely disappeared off the Amazon website. This it the first time of something like this happening to me. Next time I will read the sellers reviews before placing and order with them.Very Angry Consumer!!!!
2,A Good Starting Point.,"This book is a good starting point for anyone with a corn allergy or intolerance. The recipes are very easy, ideal for someone who has never cooked. For those of us who have, some of the recipes may seem un-necessary: soft boiled eggs, Baked Potatoes, Roasted Meats. There are some good recipes though, including one for ketchup. It also has a nice list of corn derived ingredients and places corn may be hidden. My main grievance with the book is that while it explains that white vinegar is made from corn and should be avoided, several of the recipes call for mayonnaise, which contains vinegar! This is a large oversight by the authors. Also be sure to read the back of the book first. There are a few ingredients that it mentions may contain corn that are listed in recipes without a warning to buy corn-free versions (e.g. vanilla). Overall this book is nice to have for some recipe ideas but should not be used as the bible for corn-free cooking."
2,Proceed with Caution,"I like this book in general. The recipes are simple and provide some good ideas for someone who might be learning how to cook in response to a newly diagnosed corn allergy..... HOWEVER the fact that this book seems to be designed for those who don't already know the basics of cooking it is dangerous in it's lack of thoroughness when discussing lurking corn additives.As an example, cream cheese most often contains a corn derivative and yet is used in some of the recipes. Consumer (of the book and the food) beware!This is a good supplement provided the reader has already done some research and is somewhat well versed in hidden corn. This book is not the authority and cannot be trusted ... no more than your good friend can be trusted to make you something corn free."
1,Don't buy this book. Seriously,"I'm not normally critical in my reviews but this book really is a waste of your money unless you truly have no idea how to cook. The recipes are entirely too simple. If you cook, you don't need this book. They are literally just giving you extremely simple recipes that don't include corn which you can do all on your own. On top of that they have mayo in a lot of the recipes (mayo has corn in it) yet they give you a recipe for ketchup (hunts ketchup is corn free).They also don't give practical advice at all. Like buy potato starch instead of corn starch as a substitute...There isn't a single piece of info in this book that I didn't figure out on my first day from going on the internet.Skip this book and spend your time wisely. On google."
3,"Good resource, but has some incorrect info","My 19mo old son is severely allergic to corn. I had struggled with coming up with replacements for store-bought ketchup, and a few other foods. This book is very good with recipes, and the ones I have tried have turned out very well. BUT it tells you to include certain ingredients OR try certain foods that most certainly contain corn, ie citric acid. People who are less sensitive probably can eat foods containing citric acid ; however, highly allergic people can not. This is a good resource to have on hand, but you definitely need to do more research on your own to identify the ingredients that may cause you a problem."
5,great recipe book,"I absolutely LOVE this book. It was the only one out there, that I could find. So I was really hoping that I could use it. It went above and beyond all my expectations!"
5,A warm-fuzzy intergenerational story,"Hedderwick is a master story teller with wonderful illustrations which delight children & adults. Katie Morag's home is so comfortably chaotic and the parents and grandmothers are characters. In this tale, there is an increased understanding between the ""fancy-ways"" Grannie mainland and her strong, competent counterpoint, Grannie Island. And the Scottish is wonderful!"
1,One Star rating is undeserved flattery,"This ""movie"" is so bad that it is actually funny to watch. Terrible dialogue and wooden characterizations abound in this (Sorry, I can't force myself to insult other movies by calling this turkey a movie!) artless waste of time and film. Even the scenery is silly. Picture this: an 1887 western railroad town, with a nice smooth gravel main street! Not a horse hoof print or wagon track to be seen anywhere! The most entertaining thing about this movie was simply watching how unbelievable it was."
1,A Bad Day in Hell,Some nice shots of a steam locomotive but the best part comes a the 1 hr 36 min part when the movie is over.
2,Didn't survive the first car wash!,"I've had a magnet on my car for years, and was trying to find a similar one for my wife's car. So I got her this - but it came off the first time she went through a car wash! A touchless car wash! Clearly not as robust a magnet as mine. Of course, could be because mine was Auburn, and hers was A&M. ;)"
1,"Ok for young kids, terrible for adults","The mallets are very small. The build quality on the balls is awful, one split in half the first day. Coat hangers are made of better quality than the wickets. Quite possibly the worst croquet set I have ever used."
1,Don't disappoint your son with this product!,"This set,after 1 family outing of normal use, had to be returned. My 10 yo son was disappointed. He's wanted a set for a set for a couple of summers now. The balls were dented & 2 mallets cracked. Target took it back & refunded us without problem, though. I can't believe Target carried this product. Overall all of their stuff is great, this product for me, will make me check their items much more closely!"
1,disastrous,"i bought one of these at target, and it was a major disappointment. chunks of plastic fell off the ends of both mallets we were using in the first game, and the balls got pock-marked immediately. (admittedly my boyfriend is an unusually aggressive croquet player, but even so...) the bag looks good from the outside, but is lined with cardboard and super flimsy. we also bought a badminton set by the same company at the same time, and the shuttlecock burst through the strings of both rackets on the first game. we had to return them both the next day. beware!!!"
4,Nice set,"This set seems reasonably sturdy. The mallets and stakes are nice wooden ones. The balls are just a little lighter than I think they should be, but I'm no croquet expert. To fit the pieces into the storage bag, I think you have to take the heads off of the mallets (at least they didn't seem to fit while still assembled). That's a little inconvenient but not terrible. The bag itself seems to be one that will hold up for awhile."
3,Not bad,"These are very citrus-flavored, which covers up the expected chalkiness of big tablets. I was recommended to take several thousand milligrams a day for a while and this was a good option as I could space out 6 tablets throughout the day."
4,A Good All-around Sampling of Hadith for the Student,"Unlike the other reviewers of this book at this site, I am not a Muslim, and while I would like to think that I have some appreciation of sectarian differences in Islam I cannot say that I understand the nature of the polemic cited in the other reviews. The book is a fine, shipshape collection of hadith with Arabic text and English translation, arranged in an intelligent order; it is hardbound as well, so it is an excellent value to anyone starting out the study of hadith. My interest in the book was as a student of Arabic. As any literate Arab would be familiar with at least the more common hadith, most students of Arabic would be happy to have a reference on the subject which is informative and intelligent without being overly exhaustive, which is exactly what this book is."
5,A review for students of Arabic,"This is a superb resource for students of classical Arabic. Arabic and English texts are set side by side on the same page, only the essence of each hadith is presented (eliminating long isnads and variations of the hadith), and the Arabic texts are fully voweled. This is the ideal work for an intermediate level between textbook readers and slogging through real old Arabic texts. The editor's notes and introductions are interesting, providing insight into at least one Muslim's view of the meaning and relevance of hadith in modern times. Whatever weaknesses this book may possess it was good enough to lead me to a deeper study of the original sources."
2,A Sanitized Selection,"This collection, dependent heavily on Bukhari, sanitizes what Bukhari himself reduced: the then-known collection of over 400,000 haditha to over 7000. The original 9th Bukhari's compilation runs about 1300 pages with over 7000 haditha.(You can find Bukhari's full text collection online.) The really odd and frightening stuff is in the full Bukhari version. One never knows with these collections what hazrat Mohammad really said since they were collected 150-200 yrs after he lived and are subject to the collators preconceptions about what Mohammad would, in fact, have said. Remember, there is no canon for these sayings. I gave my copy away after taking pains to download the full electronic collection."
1,A classical sample of deceptive writing,"This is a classical sample of deceptive literature common in the last 50 years. The life of the Holy Prophet is protrayed in a way to palacate the uninformed in Islam that he is also a prophet apart from himself as known to the billions who follow his hadiths. The writer is a modern crusader and is merely potraying the Holy prophet to both the unsuspectingly non-believer and illiterate Muslims. The author himself strictly speaking is not a proponent of Haddith and belonged to a neo-colonial religious movement known as Qadiani which has since the gaining of independence by the Indian sub-continent has been exposed as a non-muslim movement. Inbetween the message, author Muhammad Ali proposed a general shift by Muslims from their adherence to the Haddith of the Holy Prophet to the new social order advanced by the prophet of Qadiani the Mirza Ghulam Ahmedi. -bin"
4,Reliable reference book,"While this books addresses New Testament theology, the author avoids political motivations and attempts to focus on facts and scholarship. The reader is offered concise known facts on each New Testament book and general information consensus on each book, if any, from respected scholars. Conclusions from the data may be drawn as desired. An extensive bibliography on each book encourages additional study. In other words, this is a balanced and reliable reference book worth collecting."
4,An excellent introduction,"This is a very learned and useful summary of the NT. Although one could write much more -- and scores have -- about each of the books of the NT, this work is a very useful overview which encompasses a large amount of basic theological work regarding the NT. The only drawback is that it occasionally betrays the German origin, in that the translator has not fully changed the structure of sentences and paragraphs into those more familiar to a native English reader. This is however a very small disadvantage compared with the concentrated scholarship that comes with the book. It belongs in every NT library or collection."
4,"Comprehensive study guide, but not enough practice questions",This book is a good low cost summary. Covers about everything although not in as much depth as some of the Cybex books and does not outline terminology in the best way. Definetly worth the money.
5,EXCELLENT,"I found this book to be invaluable in preparing for the A+ exams. Focussed, concise, well-written. The numerous tips were invaluable, particularly how to approach the exam itself. I passed with scores of 84 and 85 percent! I have recommended it to co-workers, friends and newbies as THE guide to preparing for a+. What more can I say? BUY IT!"
4,"Some errors but was to the point, Passed high 80's 1st try.","Exam cram admits that they are not the only book you will need to completely know your duties as an A+ Service Tech, however they do a great job at what they set out to do. Get you to pass your test! The book was excellent on the hardware and troubleshooting but somewhat light on Windows, fortunately for most of us it would be redundant for them to add more Windows content. Passed High 80's after 1 week reading this book. Had average PC knowledge prior to reading book."
2,"Excuse me, what was the answer again?","Ok...real quick and simple, this book shows definite promise, as far as easy reading and comprehending. Although, there are MANY, let me repeat that, MANY mistakes in the practice test in the back, as well as a few other errors, but the practice test is a test in itself, while you are correcting the authors! So, if you want a good reading book, and feel like correcting mistakes, and not getting paid for it, this book is for you. If you want a book that WON'T confuse you, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE NO BACKGROUND IN COMPUTERS!!! STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Exam Cram for A+,"Although most of the Exam Cram books are very good and did help me study for my Certs, I thought that this book was a total waste of time. It did not cover the material on the tests well. Instead it was filled with information that is not on the Comptia test. I would not recommend this book as a cram guide. However the Exam Cram for Network + book was very good and I do recommend it."
1,This book has been replaced - The Author,"The 2nd Edition Exam Cram has been surplanted by ""A+ Exam Cram 2,"" a thoroughly revised and updated version of the book. The new book takes advantage of our new partnership with Que Publishing, and includes an interactive CD-ROM with, not only practice tests, but the entire book in electonic format. --Craig Landes, Author (11/02)"
3,Okay For a Review,This book is okay for a review. Maybe to use as a supplement to another book and some practice exams. But only a brave person would take both exams using this alone.
2,Other Guides Do A Far Better Job,"If you never read one of the other A+ study guides, you probably would never know what you are missing.This book is way too short on explanations and the practice questions would never be enough to get you through the real exam.With that said, there is no good reason to spend any time studying this book. There are too many other great alternative sources that can do all the things that this book cannot. First, start with Mike Meyers' All In One A+ Certification. Then, use the Syngress Osborne A+ Certification Guide Third Edition. I breezed through the two tests with just these books."
5,Great overall!,This book is very light on the modem issues. Actually it has none. Other than a few typos and inconsistency between different sections of the book and the cram sheet this book was excellent. However if you aren't already familiar with computers and how they work steer clear.
3,Good Review But Has Errors,"As an experienced technician who currently makes $70K a year in the computer field I found this book to be a good review guide. However, the book has numerious critical errors in information that may make you miss questions on the test! If you don't have a good background in computers DON'T USE THIS BOOK!"
2,A Good Reference Book; Not for A+,"It has way too much info for the A+ Test, Nothing on Modems AT commands, and Multimeter Testing; least 4 questions on the test. They even incorrectly state that, SCSI Chain can have upto 7 Devices. Its actually 8 Devices. Its on the test too.Way too much Data for A+ Study, Material may even confuse you. Look Elsewhere!"
4,I GOTTA DEFFEND THIS BOOK,"What was strange about this book, was that on several instances, it directaly contradicted the for dummies book by Ron Gilster. This book was almost always right, except for maybe once, and I wasn't even sure about that. This book is worth every penny. Also, and I don't usually say this about study guides, it was worth every minute of reading. Very to the point, very accurate. An excellent ""get to the point"" book. I usually backed up whatever I was unsure of with another book, which you should always do. This book never went into great detail on anything, it just gave you what you needed for the test. Enough said. I passed."
1,The Words Bounce Off Yout Head,"Yuck, this book left a bad taste in my mouth. I was using it as a second source of information but I was totally disapointed. The Orginazation in this book is crap, I'm trying to find out important files for dos and I get a freakin 3 page thing of the history of DOS. I thought it was suppose to be a cram! On one page I found a paragrah on the ""any key"", and how this means you can hit any key to go on. Yeah like that's going to be on the test. Comlete Waste of Time, get A+ for Dummies, a whole lot better organized without all the crap you dont need to know."
3,"Hardware Section = 5 stars, OS is another story","I received this book for Christmas this year a couple of weeks before I took the Hardware test. The half on hardware is outstanding. It examines all aspects of hardware in a level that's not too detailed, or complex. I passed the hardware test with ease thanks to this book.I then studied the OS half of the book and darn near memorized it, but it was all in vain. There were only about 4 questions in the OS test I took that related to the book (of which I was sure I got correct). For the OS test, I'd recommend that you learn with hands-on training.All around, this is a good book."
2,"Good source, BUT use other info","First let me say that I really like exam cram books. This one was a good source of info, but there are some specific details that should have been included. Make sure to use the cram sheet in the front of the book, it has info that wasn't in the book. YOU WILL NEED OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION. I heard a lot of recommendations for Michael Meyers' book, but didn't use it."
1,Not the smartest book on the block,The errors and contraditions I found in this book surprised me. There were also a few areas that could of been more clearly defined. Good thing I had another A+ book handy. I would say that this whole experience has given me second and third thoughts about ever buying another exam cram book again.
2,Out of Date information,"From what I've read (the first 5 chapters), the book mentioneda lot of out of date information. It kept talking about oldtechnologies like the 8086 to 80486. It barely had anything on Pentium chips. There was nothing about Pentium II and Pentium !!! processors or anything from AMD or Cyrix. The memory they talked about was obsolete and I don't think it was even revised for the new test (after summer 1998). I'd recommend another book, probably A+ for Dummies (the book I wanted to get, but they ran out of copies)."
5,not bad at all,"Having most of my computer experience being self taught, and currently working in my first ""real"" computer job, I found this book to be most useful. I read this book cover to cover,and took a few practice exams, and passed with no problem. A definite must for any A+ candidate."
4,Great Book. A must buy!,"After taking a course in A+ at college, I didn't feel like I was fully ready to take my certification test. I went out and bought this exam cram, and was able to pass the test a few days later, both the Core and the Software. This book is a must if you want quick information on what to know for the A+ test."
4,Excellent prep for the Dos/Windows portion of the A+ exam,"For anyone seeking to pass the Dos/Windows portion of the A+ exam, before CompTIA's revision of the exam to include Windows 2000 in January 2001, the A+ Exam Cram by James G. Jones is excellent.I studied this book exclusively for that test and passed by a good margin, about 200 points higher than the minimum to pass...the first time I took it :)I would not rely on this book for the Core/hardware test, however."
4,Good Preparation.,"This is an excellent book to start with. Don't waste your time on those 5 inch thick books for $70, there will be no questions on the 8086/8088 processor so you can pass them buy. They tend to pad a lot with historical information you don't need. I would recommend other sources to, just to round out your reading. I got the Exam Cram A+ Practice Tests along with the Exam Cram A+ Flash cards and they really helped me to feel confident."
4,"Great book, as long as you use it with another source","Well, just passed both halves of the A+ 93 core and 91 DOS/Win. I used this book, along with another not available here, and thought the book was well written, concise, and very informative. If you do not have any other source of material, I think that you would still do will with this book."
4,A good book for sharpening your knowledge before the tests.,I used this book after reading David Groth's A+ Complete Study Guide to prep for both tests. You do not want to go with this book alone unless you have some good prior experience but I highly recommend it for your last cram. It helped me alot with the core test and some with the Windows test (I scored 95 on Core and 89 on Windows). Your best help with the Windows side is to have experience with the program itself! I did not have any prior computer experience except as a casual user so if I can Certify so can you!! STUDY!
4,Great Choice for the A+ exam review.,This exam cram guide proved extremely beneficial in preparation for the COMPTIA A+ exam. It provides a guide to what items to memorize and provides alert notices throughout about what may appear on the exam. I found it was on target in many cases. It has a comprehensive exam questions with answers in the final chapter. It also has review test at the end of each chapter. It was beneficial in helping me pass the COMPTIA Exam with an overall score of 81%.
5,This book got the job done.,"I was really looking for a good book to fill in the gaps in my knowledge, this book was it. It wasn't too long or filled with alot of useless content. There are a few subjects that weren't on the exam, but I think they were important so that you got a grasp of the subject. I give this book credit for helping me to pass my Core and Dos/Windows tests on the first try. It is definitely money well spent."
2,This is not a good study resource,"I started preparing for my a+ exam with this book and it wasn't going well. But than my friend referred me to another book, Fast Track A+ and with the help of Fast Track i was able to pass my A+ tests. I would not recommend A+ Exam Cram to anyone."
3,Ok for final studies but be wary of mistakes,This book provided a good overview of what is on the test but be very careful of its mistakes. There are multiple mistakes in the book. Make sure you get another source for the complete information. I just got certified with a 95 core and 93 dos/windows.
2,Too many errors and confusing sample questions!,"The hardware questions in the final sample test is the worst I've seen-filled with ambiguity and errors. If you must buy the book, do not take the final sample test, especially the hardware questions. Also, this book is not for beginners- too little explanations and the information is too unorderly."
1,Do not rely on this book for A+,"The book gives you invaluable information about omputer hardware components, operating systems and troubleshooting. However, it lacks organization and presentation skills to be a study guide for A+ certification. I believe the authors have no teaching experience though they have education degrees."
3,This is good for your final cram sessions,"I got 3 books to use to pass the A+ Exam, this one, A+ Certif. for Dummies and A+ Certification Exam Guide by Meyers. I passed 1st time w/ 98% on the Core and 80% on DOS/Windows and 6/6 on the Cust Satisfaction.I really wish I could give this a higher rating but I can't. Don't rely on this as your only source of material. This book had the most discrepancies among the three. There were some good focused areas but then there were sections that went into things that are not on the exam.This book had the most substantial s/w section of the 3 books although it too missed the mark terribly.He does cover a couple areas skipped by the other 3. It is slow heavy reading. This would be better if he had a CD of questions to go w/ it. Some of his 'final exam' answers are downright wrong. So check them in the text.I would recommend using this book even considering the short comings. It does focus you for that final polish but you need to know where it's wrong too."
1,Be very careful with this book,"I took the core exam today and passed (no thanks to this book). Besides the mistakes that I found, there were some subjects that I saw on the exam which were either barely covered or not covered at all(modem commands, networking). I only wish I had that 30.00(for the book) to do over again. Good luck to all."
3,Use Exam Cram as a Supplement to your Text Book,"I passed my Core on 10/11 and DOS on 10/26. I am not here to knock Exam Cram. It is a good book, just a bit lacking in picture demonstrations, and a lot lacking in information on specific item topics when it mattered most. Use it as a supplement to whatever text book you use for your class (hopefully not Exam Cram). I also used A+ Certification for Dummies, very good book, ignore the name ending of the book, as long as you know you are not dumb no problem. Use the website Cramsession.com, go to Links, A+, many sites you can print and carry around with you (Bellows, Exam Notes, Study Guide, etc.)to read during your lunch time; also do the free practice tests online, and study, study, study, especially for the DOS exam. You have to think real hard and dig very deep in your brain to work out some of the scenarios to get the correct answers. Go to the exam with confidence and don't underestimate it, it's very tricky. Good luck!!"
3,Still worth buying,"I was disappointed with this book, but still recommend using it as one of your tools. It does have many errors, and they are not just typos. You really need to compare with other books to find the right info, which is frustrating. The Core material is good, and I picked up some info after having read Meyers. However, I found the DOS/Win material confusing and disorganized within each chapter. I have extensive experience with both DOS and Win 3.x, and found myself going to general reference books for info (Dan Gookin's DOS books, Fred Davis' The Windows 3.1 Bible - both fantastic, by the way). Dummies is another cram-type book, and I found it to be MUCH better (even for DOS/Win). There is an Exam Cram A+ Practice Test book, too, and that is much better (see my review on Amazon). I passed last week with 98% Core, 96% Dos/Win. I'm sure this book helped, but not too much. Buy it, but use it as just one tool in your toolbox. Good luck!"
2,"Exam Cram, Needs more Help.",I have reviewed this book and found a large amount of errors in it. If you looking for a good book for after thought knowledge (After the test) this this would be a good buy at the $1-5 store. If you going into the test COLD (not knowing anything) look elsewhere for the book of knowledge. This one will just confuse you more than you need to be.In addition I did not see a whole bunch of the exam test questions that were questions out of this book.
2,Ok for cramming only,"I am starting to study for my A+ exam. this book is good for camming only; meaning before and after the your real ""study"" for the A+. A lot of subjects need more elaboration. Not an A+ main study material."
2,Probably not enough...,"Probably not enough to get you the minimum 465 score on the DOS/Windows test. The core portion of the book is adequate though not outstanding. The DOS section fails to adequately prepare one for the questioning presented by CompTIA. Also, the test is being revamped and a new version will be out in early 2001. Readers may wish to consider weathering their urges to run out and buy this book, and instead wait for new literature with current 01 test information."
3,Careful!,"Good overall read. If you have no previous experience, this book alone will not help you pass the A+ tests. I found several inconsistencies compared to my ""official"" book.For example: - Which file contains the Kernel? MSDOS.sys. (Other sources claim IO.Sys) - A SECTOR is the minimum file allocation unit. (Other sources claim cluster) - Max. # of characters in a file name including path? 256 (I have seen 260 quoted.)Good book, although inconsistent with other publications focused on the A+ certification.BB - -"
2,"FORGET THIS BOOK, VERY LITTLE IS COVERED IN THE A+TEST","Forget this book, the examen changes very frequently and this book cover very little of the content of the exam. Also have many errors."
2,This is the book my school uses to teach A+ classes.,"This is the book I was given at the school I am about to attend to do my A+ Certification course. I was very much taken aback when I saw all the negative comments about A+ Exam Cram book, because I was assured that this is one of the best tutorials in the field. I will also be doing the MCSE as soon as I complete the A+, and I will be doing a thorough research on the books used for those classes. Believe me, I am in this for success and only the best will do."
4,Another reason to be interested in this show,"If you're at all interested in the Hollywood blacklist of the 1950's, this series may also be of interest. In his posthumous autobiography ""I'd Hate Myself in the Morning,"" Ring Lardner Jr. claims that he and several other blacklisted screenwriters were hired to write episodes of this series (under pseudonyms, of course) and were able to deal with, in Lardner's words, ""the issues and institutions of Eisenhower-era America"" - through metaphor, of course."
2,polled in the top ten bad christmas movies ever.,This is one of the worst big budget christmas movies on fandangos list. It really is a bad movie and it is like the first classic home alone only in name and vaguely in plot. THe dvd looks fine but this one should be avoided unless you are collecting the home alone series.
5,"A very good movie, the best one","I think out of alll of the Home Alones, this one bye far rates the best. There is a much better story to this one. In the other one how could your forget you kid, then fly on a plane far away. This one is also has a lot of funny parts unlike the other one. I would rate this movire 5 stars and the other one 3 stars. I liked the kid that was in this a lot better the that other kid. This a whole new twist to the other two and is a very good twist. All this stuff in the movie is a little bit creative but more real than the other ones. I will bye this movie a soon is possible and I think you should two. I would rate this movie the best one that came out in while."
5,"Our Christmas favorite, kids are funny.","This is our favorite movie for the holidays or when it is snowing and cold outside. This is the best of the Home alone movies. I like this kid better than the first kid. His acting is really good. I mean yo uknow that a kid cannot do some of the things that they have him do, but it is very funny to see what this kid does, some of the things that you see being done you cannot figure out what he is doing. This one does not involve the kid being left behind for the holiday, much more believable series of events."
4,This is Good but the First Two hits 20th Century Fox,"All Right, Well, this movie got lots of good action (PG-13 actions) but the characters are not originals. This movie is about an eight year old boy, Alex Pruitt spots a burglar in other neighbor's houses and he calls the police in two days, but the cops never found the burglar so they and everyone in Alex's family don't believe him, They think he was making false alarms.After the two days of calling the police, he drives the remote controlled car with an 8mm camcorder on top videotaping and all the burglars were chasing the car.After that day, the slapstick action and then the police finally believe Alex.The End."
2,Very Funny Yet so unrealistic,it was funny but if you look at all the things this small little 8-9 year old kid can do. I can not see how a boy like that can hook up electricity or do so many traps. wasn't alex sick with the chicken pox and he did all those traps! by himself very likely they don't show us many of the harder traps (Calkin you saw all his traps being made by himself). I reckon go back to leaving the kid home alone while the family is on vacation (bring back Marv and Harry).
2,Don't watch,The movie was very boring.The chase after the remote control car went on for about fifteen minuits!Its confusing too.I think that the makers of it just wanted to do the part with the boby traps.On the other hand it is very funny.
1,Home Alone 3 wasn't very good!,I like the Home Alone movies but I didn't like this one. I thought this third sequel of the Home Alone series was terrible it was more like a childern's movie. This wasn't like the other Home Alone movies it was like a different movie without a title. They should have stopped at 2 because I thought it was pretty stupid by the way they got a new kid to play in a new Home Alone movie they should have come up with a different title then naming it Home Alone 3 I thought that was dumb. I wonder what happened to Macaulay Culkin he was better than this kid who played in Home Alone 3.
1,THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE,I think that this movie could have been better if it had Culkin in it! I don't recommend you buying it if you like comedy.
3,OK,"This movie was just ok. It wasn't the same actors as the last 2 movies and in this one the main charector doesn't get left behind or anything. Parts of the movie were pretty funny, but the title doesn't really fit the movie. Alex(the kid) gets the chicken pox and the parents can't stay home to take care of him because work gets in the way and 4 bandits accidendly misplace a computer chip and the kid ends up getting it. The criminal group finds out he has it and tries to get the chip back because the criminal groups leader or boss wants it back."
1,Home Alone 3,"We received the video, but it was blank--with nothing recorded on it. I'm waiting to hear from Amazon as to how to get the issue reconciled."
3,home alone 3 movie,"The dvd came on time to us. However, it was listed as brand new and it was clearly a used copy, so that was a little disapointing. Other than that it was fine."
5,The best Home Alone,It was better than the first two! The traps were better and Alex was much funnier than Kevin and a better actor too. The movie had four crooks instead of two and they weren't nearly as dumb as they were in 1 and 2. The movie also had lots of animals which is always cool!
2,Not Worthy of the Home Alone Name,"I find myself asking myself why this movie was ever made. It has absolutely nothing to do with the previous two magical movies (no Macauley Culkin - or more importantly Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern). The makers of this disaster must have wanted to appeal to those few who were tired of the original movies. No one involved in the first two bothered to show up and for good reason. When Macauley Culkin grew out of the role, no one should have even bothered to resurrect the franchise. The young kid had no life (Mac had more magic in his little toe than Alex does). The three crooks are inane; a woman was also introduced which does not help. The point being: ditch this abomination and stick with the first two."
3,Home Alone 3,"I did not agree with the theme of this movie. I believe there is entirely too much said about the topic of criminals and children. Children under the age of ten may find it entertaining, however."
3,"This is ok, But the First Two were Better.",But this one is better than the 4th one! but not better than the frist two! it's just the funny is a little lost thats all!
4,GIVE HOME ALONE 3 A BREAK,"In preveious reveiws people say ""why is it a home alone movie?"" with a new kid? Well The first kid (cant spell the name) in the 1st and 2nd movie is too old like 18 or 19 he can't do it. Also if it was the same it would get boring. The reason for the 4 star rating not 5 is because something doesnt make sense. Airport secuirty cant just see though plastic bags. It could see in side the toy car furthermore exposing them. Other wise it was a laugh out loud funny film."
2,2-1/2 stars -- Whose idea was this?,"By the time this movie was released, the Home Alone craze was over. And the movies weren't necessarily played out because Macaulay Culkin had gotten older; they were played out anyway. I guess this movie was a vehicle to lift Alex D. Linz to superstar status, which, consequently, didn't happen (have you heard from him since then?). Parts of the movie were interesting, but not many. And you know a movie is weak when it's a so-called ""sequel"" yet none of the original characters are in it (see also House Party 4 - wait, don't)."
1,This one just ruined the whole entire series,the series would have been fine if they wouldn't have made this one. it's not even close to what 1 and 2 were! and what now? they made a 4th one?! i don't know about you guys but i thought the movie sucked big time. they could have put Macaulay Culkin in this one! he only would have been about 11 or 12 if he would have played in it.
1,The First 2 Where Better.,"The 1 Thing I am Giving This Movie 1 Star Because It Don't Have Kevin, Harry, Marv, Or The Rest Of The McAllister Family. Culken Is A Better Actor Then Alex D. Linz. Don't Buy This."
4,Uhhh,"I'll admit it, the first time I saw this movie I was mad that Macaulay Culkin was not featured, but that changed quickly.The movie was different than the first two because Kevin (or Alex in this one) was not left home for a long amount of time, he was just a Latchkey Kid. On top of that, the mom even without knowing became ""acquainted"" with the bad guys (because they moved in down the street!!). Ha, I really enjoyed that part!You can see this movie is different and more entertaining in different ways. I do miss the mom from the original 2 (Catherine O'Hara), I really liked her acting.So, with all the other reviews telling you what the film is about and how stupid it was, you really should just see for yourself. Heck, if you are too afraid to pay for a potentially disappointing film, download it the ""illegal"" way, although I don't recommend that ;-)"
4,This would be 5 stars except for a couple of things,"I really liked Home Alone 3 just as much as the others because it was different. I like Linz better than McCulkin but there was a few things I didn't like. First of all, I couldn't stand ""Alice Ribbons"" the lady burglar, who was just so annoying, I liked Marv and Harry more. Second, the music wasn't as good in this one. But other than that, I liked this one just as much."
2,"Forced humor, at best","I understand why they had to use a new actor for this movie... the original is in his 20's! But they could have changed a couple other things while they were at it. It was predictable and not very original. Sure, my kids and I laughed where we were supposed to, but it was just a rehash of the previous 2 Home Alone movies."
1,Taken it too far!,"I love the first two Home Alone movies. They're classics! This one and the 4th one just completely kill the series! The acting is terrible, it isn't funny and you'd think they would at least make the story tie into the last one. They make one reference to the first two and it isn't even funny. I don't recommend this to anyone!"
4,GO ALEX!!!!!!!!!!,Wow! The Booby Traps were even more severe and a lot better!! Although I really miss Harry and MarvPROS--Booby Traps are better-Number of criminals extendBAD--Acting is half terrible-This movie has a totally different castWhat I don't understand is the storyline. IT'S DIFFERENT!!!!!!
4,Grandkids love it,"I bought this for my grandchildren, who have Home Alone and Home Alone 2.They love this one. It stands by itself because the characters are different, and keeps them entertained time after time."
4,Kids Will Be Kids,"Home Alone 3 features a different kid and family than does Home Alone 1 and 2. In this one, the young lad who is home alone has the chicken pox. His sister is a young Scarlett Johansen. The story stems from the boy picking up the wrong bag at the airport that looks just like his. He comes home with a valuable component that the bad guys want their hands on and they are determined to locate and retrieve the item. He pulls Home Alone style pranks on the bad guys and involves a remote controlled vehicle and his pet rodent in some of the mischievous schemes."
1,Worthless,"This VHS tape of ""Home Alone 3"" is supposedly new. Ha! The soundtrack is uneven, soft, then loud every few seconds. I tried it in three different players. I should have got the DVD or just been satisfied with Netflix. Total waste. So much for third party vendors.Tsarevich"
1,File loading problems with this DVD,"I tried playing this movie on several different DVD players and it turns out it is corrupt. It stops about 12 minutes into the movie at the same place and does not play any further on it's own. I tried forwarding it past that spot, but from there it would simply stop after another 2 minutes. Bad disk."
2,Very disappointed,"Even though my 7-year old son was happy with his Christmas gift, I was very disappointed with the overall quality of the sheet set and comforter that I purchased separately. The sheets are extremely stiff, even after washing and the comforter colors are so washed out the dark gray that appears in the pictures is actually a very, very light gray. The dogs are also very, very washed out. I thought maybe I just got a bad comforter but the colors on the sheets were also faded in comparison to the picture on the packaging. I ultimately decided to keep everything because there are so few dog comforter sets out there but I would not recommend."
1,Exploding mist pump - AVOID at all costs.,"Seemed like a good idea -- but the very first time I filled it with oil and started pumping it (about 10 times), it exploded. The entire bottom of the canister exploded open and blew off, covering every square inch of my kitchen (including the ceiling) with oil. It will take days to clean up the mess -- plus the closthes I was wearing are totally ruined. The kitchen will also need to be repainted. I can't believe a company is selling a product this dangerous and defective. Avoid this product at all costs."
4,pete townshend live at brixton,"when they remastered this i wish they had included the complete concert with songs such as ""i am an animal"" from ""Empty Glass"" lulckily i taped the concert when it was televised, now if they would only release the DVD. David Gilmore appears as a guest on this album and does a fine job."
4,Great live cd!,"Pete in top form here,very underrated cd .My only bad thing to say about this cd is that it has no listing of the musicians on it."
4,What a Bargain!!!,"I have always been a fan of The Who, and therefore, of their bandmates' solo efforts. I had this vynil for a while, and eventually decided to get the CD as well. Truth of the matter, there's nothing new or extraordinarily different in the selections presented herein, so if you like the songs, Pete's singing and the acoustic atmosphere, just go for it!!! It's so cheap they must have gone crazy or something... Why 4 stars? Mix sounds too much like the vynil!"
4,TRACK LISTING:,Song Titles:1. Barefootin'2. After the Fire3. Behind Blue Eyes4. Stop Hurting People5. I'm One6. I Put a Spell on You7. Save It for Later8. Pinball Wizard9. Little Is Enough10. Eyesight to the Blind11. Magic Bus12. Won't Get Fooled Again
4,two books in one,"The author did a great job of blending two very different story types into a single novel. Time and Chance is part Jack Kerouac On the Road, part a military thriller. The two aspects go together well. The story is adventuresome, tragic and intriguing, to say the least, and well written and told. The backdrop to much of the book is life in Amsterdam, which adds a lot to the story. There's an interesting ending that stays with you for awhile, keeps you thinking. Open a Heineken and read this book."
5,Intrigue and Complexities Will Appeal to Both Sexes,"I found Time and Chance engaging from start to finish. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys well written thought provoking works. The book deals with the impact of the trauma of war, juxtaposed against a back drop of underground life and the enigma of conscious and unconscious choices men and women make."
2,Great cover,"Please let me start by saying that I have not yet written a critical review. I am fairly easy to please in the romance novel dept. so this is difficult for me to say~ but this book did not meet my expectations for it. The cover is beautiful and the historical premise is fascinating and well researched. Where I found fault was the actual writing itself. The opening sentence, ""The air was cold and damp."" is not too far from ""It was a dark and stormy night."" The plot is fine but the descriptions are lacking innovation. There is far too much ""telling"" -- a writer's term for not showing enough through the actions of the characters. Instead they used narrative far too much when I would have rather seen the descriptions shown through the actions and dialogue of the characters. If one wants to read about this particular time in the reign of Elizabeth it would be helpful and fun to read for that reason. As a romance however, there are others that are more original in their descriptions."
1,frustrating phones,I would not recommend these phones. They beep and turn off constantly. I can only guess it is because I have wireless internet in my house. The wireless internet is not connected to the same phone line that these phones are connected to so that should not be why. The only reason I have not returned the phones is because my children threw away the box.
1,Hot Garbage!!!,"I purchased this phone about 1 1/2 years ago and it finds new ways to fail me every couple of months. All batteries are about shot, there is a lot of static in the sound, and the display is faded and no longer provides a legible caller ID. The display looks like foreign symbols of a language from a distant land, maybe Shangri-La. Due to my frustration with this product, I have strongly considered deactivating my home phone service. I usually do not go out of my way to comment on a product unless I am extremely pleased or dissatisfied with its performance. Going out of my way to write a review about this product so that others do not make a similar mistake, is apart of my moral obligation to society. I do have other VTech products that work exceptionally well. This phone should've probably been more thoroughly tested before entering the market for sale. DO NOT PURCHASE!"
1,I'm throwing it out,"We bought this phone b/c a previous vtech phone served us well. This one, however is just missing too many key features that I took for granted. For instance, there is no speaker phone feature (was great for when I was put on hold) and the ringer volume control only works if you press it WHILE the phone is ringing, and then resets to ""loud"" for the next call - in my house the phone keeps waking up the baby and I can't set any handset or the base to silent mode. Also, switching to pick up call waitibg is a crapshoot, you never know if you will disconnect one or both people. If you want a totally stripped down phone, this might work for you. For anyone else, it's a step down."
1,These phones are terrible!,Do not buy these phones! I got them for my mom and the sound quality is AWFUL. There is a constant low buzzing sound. I am returning them. Don't make the same mistake I did!
4,Never a problem,I have had these phones for a while and have not experienced a problem. Transferring to other phones is a great idea. Only wish there is a way to be able to talk on 2 lines as the same time. Wish my cell phone experience was as good.
1,Not a reliable phone,The other comments about static and low range were proven by my experience with this phone. I have used other VTECH phones with great success. Unfortunately this is not true for this model.
1,Awful!,"The phone was cheap...and now I know why! Crazy beeping, loud static and short battery life. Don't waste your money on this phone."
2,"Works as a phone, that's about it","We have not had the problems that the other people have listed above, where the phone just does not work (even though we have a wireless network as well).However, we have had a consistent battle with the caller ID. We have DirectTV, and the receivers pick up the caller ID before the phone. Actually, most time the caller ID never comes up before the message kicks off."
1,Not worth the money!,"Wow - I picked these phones up at a local discount chain and I thought I got a great deal. I was soooo wrong. These phones should have come with a check paying me to try them. Like the other reviewer - I threw away the box so I couldn't return them. Also, if one phone is dying, you can't just pick up another phone - you have to 'transfer' the call. The worst part came after we owned the phones for three weeks: after about four minutes of talk time the phone goes to complete static. I guess it cuts down on my long-distance calls!Bottom line - I would NOT buy this set again."
1,horrible phone,"I should have read the reviews before I bought this phone. I plugged it in and that was the last time it worked. After it charged I tried to call and got nothing but static. If you have a wireless connection in your house this phone will not work. After that I never got another dial tone on any handset. It always said, ""connecting"" and never connected. This is just a horrible phone."
2,not sure,"I love it because i love the painting, but the size is kinda cheated. They give you the size you order but most of the poster is white border, the painting is actually much smaller than what is specified"
4,"A little large, but very nice",These are beautiful though they are a little large for my taste. Very pretty and high quality though. I also have the matching necklace. It makes a great set.
5,"Best PIX book ever, must have if you are interested in 7.0.","This book is exactly what I was looking for. It gives a detailed breakdown of the original technologies as well as the ins and outs of the new features of 7.0. I like this book more than the others that I have read in the past. From the first page of the first chapter you are reading worthwhile material. Not the definition of a firewall, or the layers of the OSI model, or even the layout of Cisco's certification trail. This is good detailed information, in an easy to read format with excellent examples from start to finish. The comparisons of ""how it's done on 6.3 and now on 7.0"" are great as well.Awesome book!"
4,"More detail, please","While the book was rather detailed in several areas, I was hoping it would be more detailed on the subject of VPN. While most of it is straight forward, configuring VPN on the 5520 was a pain. Someone reading this book should be from a large enterprise, using failover, etc. Someone from a small company that is not using these features might find it to be overkill, and start looking for other books to meet their specific needs."
4,"Pretty Good, But Could Have Been Better...","I purchased this book to come up to speed on the new 7.0 code and new features of the ASA. It has great references for the code and helped work through my configuration. I would have given this book a 5, but it did not contain much information pertaining to VPN and Intrusion Protection/Prevention. All in all, well worth the price and it will serve as a great reference book as we upgrade our remaining PIXs to ASAs."
4,Simple,"Steve McQueen drives a Porsche 917 very quickly for 24 hours. That is 'Le Mans', and no more needs to be said."
3,Gotta love Steve,"This movie is not for everyone. Not a lot of dialog, a whole lot of LeMans racing. You better be a Steve McQueen fan or this movie will bore you to death"
3,Improving your zen capabilities,"perhaps the most beautiful film ever made about this famous French race. We can almost feel the driver's sensation and all the tension of the race, trying to keep zen in front of this film even for the Dalai Lama is a challenge..."
5,An outstanding classic of a time remembered for ever!,"Without a doubt one of the top movies of not just racing but of the total package never to be created again. One of the reason why I had to give in to Blue Ray since they no longer make HD DVD, too bad they did not get out the non-Blue version in HD DVD...which I have many of. Excellent views of the LeMans experience for it is not just a race but an adventure. Hard to believe that this movie is near 40 years old!! And what they did to ""make it more safe"" and lower the speeds as it is now has taken alot of the drama out of the race. The day of the Porsches and the Ford GT40s which were not featured. A remarkable movie which should not be missed in this version."
4,"The Classic, the Original","What more can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. If you are a car guy, this needs to be in your DVD player. The fact that there isn't any dialog for the first 20 minutes of the movie is a good thing!!"
4,Greatest Auto Racing Movie,"Le Mans is the greatest auto racing movie ever made! I would recommend for anyone with an interest in this area. Be aware that it is almost more a documentary, as the emphasis is on auto racing without much dialogue or plot. As I have previously found to be the case, Amazon's service was excellent, meeting all that they promised."
4,Outstanding racing movie,"Excellent ""Steve McQueen movie."" If you are looking for a lot dialogue, this is not it. If you want subtle acting, fast cars and a realistic storyline, this ones for you. It has held up well since being made.The video and audio are very good. You will be pleased."
5,LeMans,"This is the best non-documentary racing movie ever produced/filmed, bar none. The cinematography comes the closest of any movie in making you feel the energy of being at the actual event. Awesome!!"
5,2nd best RACING film behing Grand Prix..!!,This is the story of race driver Steve McQueen coming back to LeMans after a crash (shunt) the previous year where another driver was killed. Film shows the preparation it takes to put on a race and the physical and emotional toll on drivers (and wives/girlfriends) when the race is won or lost. Extremely good race footage and some spectacular crashes caught on film. McQueen meets the wife of the driver that was killed and you can see from the interaction the pain that racing has caused. I like this film and rate it one of the very best racing movies of all time...behind GRAND PRIX...and ahead of..THE RACERS with Kirk Douglas....don't miss this film if you like racing.
5,Best motor racing movie ever - superb DVD,"I'll keep it short and sweet - Le Mans is the best motor racing movie ever, and the DVD looks absolutely superb, with a terrific widescreen print that showcases the stunning cars of the era (the most exciting cars ever built in my humble opinion). In particular, the first 8-10 minutes of the race is a master class in motor sport cinematography and editing. On the first lap we are able to marvel at the sights, and incredible sounds, of the mighty Porsche 917's and Ferrari 512's dueling, and then, as lap two begins, Michael Legrand's outstanding, upbeat and funky-ish orchestral score kicks in, helping propel the race footage to further levels of excitement. I could go on, but I won't. Buy this essential DVD."
4,Le Mans with Steve McQueen,An excellent sports car racing movie.Steve McQueen is great in it. He actually has raced in these type of cars and he did most of his own driving in the movie.
1,"5 star movie, but no extra features on the DVD.","The movie gets 5 stars, but the DVD package gets 1 for poor effort. Reason: there doesn't appear to be anything extra on the DVD. This is one of the greatest racing movies of all time and there isn't any special features, so why would I get rid of my Laser Disc copy? I would like to see a ""making of"" documentary or perhaps interviews with the crew 30 years later. Speedchannel had a great documentary on this movie that should be included in the dvd. It had great stories from the film makers and Steve McQueen's son. I'm just a little disappointed in Paramount and the movie's release to DVD. This great movie deserves more than just being on the new format."
3,Great Cars In Action,"Buy this movie if you love vintage racing action. Because there is not much else to the movie, no real plot line or character development."
4,"Even better on DVD, but.......","This is still the finest racing movie ever made, and, in the light of today's restrictions, ever likely to be made. The widescreen DVD with Dolby Surround track is long overdue. The only problem I have with the movie itself is the difficulty in hearing the background loudspeaker announcements in my non-Dolby environment.So why only 4 stars? The lack of any bonus material, particularly the one item that should have been included: ""Filming at Speed"", the fine documentary about the making of the movie. Hopefully a future release will include the documentary.Still, if you care about motor racing, do not hesitate to buy this DVD! Then find someone with a big-screen TV and Dolby Surround to give yourself the full experience."
2,Le Mans,"Very weak plot (none), fantastic car film work. Grand Prix with James Garner is a better film"
3,a flawed but intresting movie,"i like mcqueen but i'm not that big a raceing fan. while this is a very well made movie and mcqueen is very good,this one just didn't get me hooked. if you are a race fan you may like this one,other wise you may find this a little hard to take"
2,Make no mistake: This is NOT a movie!,"Make no mistake: This is NOT a movie! I'm rating it two stars not because it's bad. It's just because this is almost a doccumentary, not a movie. There is absolutely NO acting, no dialogues. The few times the cast open their mouths arwe for some contrieved and dull dialogues (although they do their best clearly). The movie is an endless line of cars chasing cars and chasing cars. If you're an auto-racing fan (like myself), it's clear you'll enjoy the sequences. But, if you are not biased, you'll notice clearly why this movie bombed at the box office.It's not a bad movie at all!! It's a GREAT Movie. But, unfortunately, it has no actor nor dialogues."
2,It will bore you indefinitely....,"The photography is really amazing, but the movie is simply boring. Al least, at the end the victory goes to Larry Wilson, not for Steve ""Michael Delaney"" McQueen, what is a good turn to the movie. (The POrsche cars wew driven by pilots such as Jacky Ickx).The idea of this movie was to document the suspense, drama, power and energy of a 24-hour race at Le Mans (the 1970 edition. It accomplished its purpose, but it's not a great movie experience."
5,The greatest racing movie,"I saw McQueen almost win the 1971 Sebring race against the likes of Mario Andretti (who did win). Steve was a real racer, and this is a real racer's movie."
5,Classic action,"What hasn't been said about Le Mans?? Short on story substance, long on action!!! If you've got a good surround system, let the glorious Porsche flat twelves and Ferrari v-twelves rip thru your speakers!!"
5,Great Race Action Movie,"I saw this movie as a kid and feel in love with it then. Spent most of my adult life trying to find it. One of the ""great"" race movies ever... even the stunts were great! Well worth the $($$$)!"
5,THE racing film,This is the best film covering motor racing ever made. It also covers the peak era for sports car racing and has the greatest racing car of all time as its co-star (Porsche 917). What more could you want - Steve McQueen and several 917s.
5,This Was Done Right!,"This movie takes full advantage of the medium... high quality film and a huge screen to portray the savage beauty of racing. Just saw in HD and this movie is all great camera shots and perfect sequencing. There is almost no ""Hollywood"" feel at all, just great cars and action.If they filmed all the racing first then cobbled together a script it was absolutely the right approach. The ""script"" does not really matter and should take a backseat when the driving, camera work and editing is as well done as this movie. An incredible feast for the eyes and ears (crank up the home theater and listen to those beasts roar!)"
2,Short lived life,"I bought these tongs at the same time as the rosle 9"" tongs (which are amazing). The cuispro tongs are no longer around. The first time they were dropped, the black plastic locking mechanism broke off. The second time they hit the floor, they were finiched. Stuff happens at work, things fall off the counter top, People drop untensils, it just happens. Thes tongs arent sturdy, and arent meant for a commercial kitchen. Go with the 9"" rosle tongs."
1,The worst tv ever made,"My best friend just bought this, and it totally died after 4 days! he took it back to Best Buy, and customer service said that every one they sold was returned within a week for just dying. The clarity is... okay at best. He exchanged his for a 52"" LG DLP for the same price, and it looks way better. Remember just because something is cheap, doesn't mean it's good....RCA = Garbage"
2,Keep Cover Closed,"Following a long line of photographers known for creative and original approaches to the female form, Jean-Francois Jonvelle photographs as though he is in the wrong line. Unlike fellow countrymen Jeanloup Sieff and Patrick Demarchelier - both masters in photographing the nude - Jonvelle's images are sophomoric, lacking in sensuality, poetry, originality, and subtlety. The photographs are simply trite, at best. Jonvelle's attempts at titillation or playfulness are far from eliciting a joie de vivre but instead, translate easily into the mundane. There is one positive note in regard to this debacle of derrieres: the book is thin."
2,Attractive women almost make up for the poor quality,"Most of the women in this book are very attractive. I've nothing more to say of a positive nature.Jonvelle would benefit from a college photography course, because his grainy, washed out photographs are completely lacking of even the most basic technical quality. This is annoying and distracting, and the beautiful women in these pages deserve better.And it appears Jonvelle is striving for sexy pictures, but the harder he tries, the more contived and raunchy the result. Once again -- these women deserve better.Having said all that, there are perhaps a half-dozen good (not great) pictures in this book.Here's hoping that in the future Jonvelle will learn to take his craft seriously and give his subjects the dignity they deserve."
3,pleasing to the eye,"If you are interested in photography that celebrates the female form, this book is a good start. You won't see anything profound but there are some worthwhile pics. For the most part I would describe these images as a man's view of the intimate settings he may encounter with his beautiful lover. The models he uses are all borderline supermodels and therefor he may be considered to have sacrificed realism for aesthetics, but so be it. As a whole; there are some images that I found to be cheesy and cliche, but for the most part Jonvelle(s) is a pleasure to experience. In no way is it pornography in my opinion, but if this book is to be left on the coffee table, expect disapproval from any hardcore feminist visitors."
3,He Tries Too Hard,"I love the visual style of this book. The large, grainy photos break almost every rule of conventional photography. It ends a voyeuristic reality to the book that's delightful. However, his models ruin it. They, in most of the pictures, are too aware of the camera, they play up to it. This turns the book into something I'd expect to see as a B&W spread in Penthouse. The images in which he and the models relaxed and quit trying to make a photograph are wonderful. Unfortunately, there are only about ten of these images in the entire book. It's an interesting look into the genre."
4,SLOW START,"This movie made you think. But the beginning of it was very, very, very, slow. They took you all around the block just to give Miss E character. But once you get past that the movie keeps you on your toes. Especially with a shocker that did not gross you out. But made you understand sleeping around so much and lies may cause you to sleep with a little bit of yourself. Very interesting movie. The little boy was such a great actor even the audience clapped for him. The Doggish agent was saying baby tooo much especially when he did not have that Louisiana twang.The movie is a must see. BUY IT!"
2,Potty Mouth Production,This has entirely too much unnecessary cursing in it. The storyline was sometimes hard to follow.
1,dont even bother,"it was BAD BAD BAD if your looking for comedy, drama your not getting it, Suspense maybe waiting to see when or if it gets better, Suspense waiting for it to be over can i return my dvd i've been robbed!"
3,Not bad..,"Bezel to me is a good rapper. He has good punchlines and makes good songs. Although it is only a mixtape, it is quite good.The only real problem with it is the fact that most of the songs are old. They should have done all new songs instead of putting old material on it."
2,nice art poorly published,"I like Sperlonga a lot, and this is a very nice selection of his work. However, this is a magazine and not a paperback. The cover and pages are very thin. SQP has just not put together a book with quality paper. If you can find the hardback on the web it is better though pricey."
4,Perfect for that twisted someone.,"If you know a twisted person who likes man on man romance and corny humor, this is the perfect gift."
5,The FUNNIEST Martial Arts Movie Of ALL TIME,"This is an instant cult classic. They tried their best to make the movie serious, but no prevail. It stars Don Niam ( Stingray ) a ruthless serial killer with a troubled past who is obsessed with his Mommy. He participates in death matches and because of his uncontrolled rage he beats his wife. His wife leaves, tired from the abuse. From that moment on he goes on a rampage killing every woman with a flower dress because he thinks it's his wife Ana or his Mommy? The rest is a suprise... Filled with action, cheesy acting, and lines you repeat over and over with friends. LOL! Enjoy with a large body of friends."
5,must see for 80's karate movie cult fans,"They just don't make great cheesy martial arts flix like this anymore. From 84 til 94 were the best times for direct to video action movies. I was never one for the Hollywood blockbuster hype movies with the big starts. Hollywood is all politics that picks who we see, and what we see. Independent films exposed us to some great movies and talented stars that Hollywood just blew off.This movie is a lot fun, with notch fight scenes from REAL martial artiest. 5 out of 5 starts lol"
5,This was the funniest thing I've ever seen!!,"With lines like ""They're all a bunch of crackheads!"", how can this movie not be taken seriously?? I must say, if you want to see a good movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then don't rent this. Rent ""Moonwalker"" with Michael Jackson, but for God's sake, not this. Even the Pee Wee movies have more suspense than this!But if you want to honestly say to all of your friends ""I've just seen the worst movie of all time."", then rent it. Stingray (Dahnny Niam) had to be the funniest part in the movie, because he has crazy hair and broad shoulders!! Oh yeah!! Rent this!!"
2,Can't rate,Unable to play it on my dvd as it's from the UK and is not compatible with my dvd .Would really like to see it as I likeCynthia Rothrock.
1,More pain than I have ever felt,"I put it in before bed and woke up in horrible pain. I have never felt anything like it and I took a long shower desperately trying to get it off. I wound up running to the store for an emergency douche. I screamed the whole time I was trying to get it out of me. Then, as soon as I was clean, pain gone."
1,Be warned!!!!,"I have used this several times with no issues, but this last time had a horrible reaction and the burning was like nothing I have ever experienced before!!!! Not sure why it happened this time but it was 100x worse than the symptoms!!"
5,Worked!,"I used the 1200mg one. Used at night. Next day I had a bit of burning, not much. You need a pantyliner to protect your underwear. Worked great, cleared everything up 100%. The yeast inf. has not returned ever since (I have it sometimes when I drink coffee every day. Yes!). I will buy it again for sure when I need it. Little burning like I mentioned, no big deal for me, but the results were 100% successful. :-)"
1,Great if you like torture!,"Worst. Product. Ever. I would bet this product prolongs your infection and/or makes it worse. Here's why. It's SO DAMN CAUSTIC that it damages your tissue. (Anything that hurts that much has to be doing damage.) So your tissue become even more vulnerable. Had to wash out what was left after 24 hours. Starting to feel better already. Instead you should stick with a 3 day treatment, specifically clotrimazole.This stuff should be off the market."
1,PULL IT OFF THE SHELVES,This is by far the most horrible feminine product on the market. I had a mild-moderate yeast infection that I wanted to start treating during the day. I used this product around 1:30 pm and felt some initial relief; however by 4:30pm I was experiencing the most horrific burning pain inside that I had to hold back tears and cancel the rest of my day. It lasted all through the night with no reprieve; I am now on my way to the ER after nearly 24 hours of the worst hell of my life. MY POOR VAGINA.
1,Painful,"My pap showed yeast and then I had to take two different antibiotics--preparing for infertility treatments and then my salivary gland swelled with an ear infection. Of course the yeast infection became horrible. I used this product without a problem, and then the symptoms returned two weeks later. I tried it again and experienced the severe burning in the middle of the night. No allergies or sensitive skin. The burning/pain was so much worse than the yeast infection."
1,Liquid fire,I don't know if it's good or bad that I'm not the only one with this horrible reaction. You might as well be inserting liquid fire. It is definitely not worth it and I can't imagine how effective it could be when all you are trying to do to get the medicine OUT. It really causes excruciating pain and it should come with a big warning.
1,WARNING,I've never written a review in my life. I had to do this if you try Monistat 1 to take the easy way out.. I can honestly tell you its like dipping your vagina in Satan's water!! You will want to RIP (literally) RIP your vagina out from in between your legs. Its like torture. Although it works it lasts about an hour or two. I tell you first hand please don't try it.
1,1200 MGs are you kidding me!?,"I DID NOT, I repeat DID NOT pay any attention to the fact that this version of the medication has twice the MGs of the 3-day and 7-day treatments! No wonder why we're all feeling like our vaginas are about to collapse! This one day treatment has 1,200MGs in it vs the 3-day having a total of 600MGs and the 7-day 700MGs. What was Monistat thinking?"
4,JESUS CHRIST,"I, like other women on this site, read the reviews after buying/using the product and I was terrified. I was laying in bed, waiting for the burning sensation and excruciating pain.. it never came. I put in the product about 8 pm and layed down, ended up falling asleep. I also used the external cream. There was a bit of leakage but I was wearing a liner. Woke up this morning, and my burning and itching from my infection is gone about 70%. I think that if I put on the cream after my shower, I would feel good as new.IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THIS:Don't be freaked out by the reviews! It worked fine for me, and this is only my second yeast infection!"
1,Causes HORRIBLE reaction!!,"I'm up at 2am suffering from the WORST reaction I've ever had to any kind of medication! I used the Monistat 1 day ovule at 11pm right before bed, and was literally woken up in the middle of the night with excrutiating burining and itching! I took a bath and tried to get as much of the medication out of me as possible by inserting tampon after tampon to pull out excess medication, but to no avail. I'm typing this review because I can't go back to bed and hope it prevents any other women from experiencing what I'm going through right now. I echo the sentiments of other women that this product should be taken off the shelves!! Please please please save yourself a sleepless night and don't use this. My yeast infection symptoms were MUCH more bearible than this! Ugh, what a nightmare!!"
1,Stay Away,I am sitting up at 4AM right now because I have such severe burning that is much worse than before I used the Monistat combination 1 pack. I have taken a hot shower to wash out as much as possible and it provided slight relief. I forgot that I had had a similar reaction in college to this stuff. I will not forget again and stick with Vagisil next time.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I haven't reviewed anything in a decade, but I've never been in so much PAIN. I am crying right now, wishing I wouldn't have bought this product. I had no idea so many other women felt the same way. My entire genital area is burning and swollen, and it's been 24 hours. MAJOR redness, MAJOR swelling. I felt itchy when I woke up after inserting the suppository last night, and as the day progressed I only felt worse. Tonight, I had to leave the theatre to a show I really wanted to see this evening because I feel like I am going to die.Pain level 10.PLEASE TAKE THIS PRODUCT OFF THE MARKET.I've had no problem with the generic Monistat 7. DO NOT BUY THE ONE DAY. Ladies, I guarantee you it's worth the extra six days."
1,What is UP with Monistat,"Why is this happening? Severe itching. I would be able to take the burning, but the itching is unbearable. I had a mild yeast infection and thought before it gets worse I nip it in the butt. Did it the first night and thought I was going to go crazy. It got better after an hour but that was horrible. Stupid me thought I'd give it another chance a second night and third night, but the itch did not get any better. I'm find during the day, but once I apply Monistat the itching is unbearable and decided to stop and call my doctor. She prescribed the pill. Don't know what's up with Monistat I never had such a reaction and it had worked before."
1,"absolutely awful, do not use!","using this product for my mild yeast infection resulted in a nightmare of side effects worse than the original yeast infection symptoms. i was up all night crying with pain and burning, just like the other reviews say. i resorted to ice packs for some relief and just prayed for morning to come so i could get myself to urgent care for a prescription for diflucan. i would not wish this torture on anyone. if i ever use monistat again, it will be the monistat 7, which i had no problems with in the past. i don't understand how monistat 1 ever made it to the shelves."
1,Itching Burning Mess,"This stuff creates the most intense itching/burning sensation ever. It literally feels like fire ants inside your vagina. No matter what you do it doesn't help. The sensation lasted for several hours but then faded away. I do think that the medication works, but it is way too strong. I will definitely be purchasing the 5 or 7 day treatment next time."
1,God help me!,"I am in the same boat as many of you. I used this stuff two nights ago and I am so much worse off than I was. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this stuff. It should be pulled, or have strict warning labels that it could cause terrible reactions. Luckily I work from home so I was able to sit on an ice pack yesterday and today. When I sleep (LOL) I wake up at least 4 times scratching the heck out of myself. This is insane! I had to skip swim practice tonight because I just don't feel up to being around anyone and I don't know how the chlorine would feel against my miserable skin. I have to go to school tomorrow night and act like all is well. Someone needs to do something about this garbage. I hope this doesn't go on forever."
1,DO NOT USE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD LITERALLY YOU WILL CRY!!!,this product produces the WORST BURNING PAIN that you will ever experience it will wake you up at night and you will curse yourself for buying the 1 day stuff and will be frantically trying to wash all of it out to no avail. please do yourself a favor and DO NOT USE THIS!!! OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! soso terrible. the yeast ifection felt better than this crap!!!!
1,This product deserves -5 stars...,"I purchased this product after a round of antibiotics had given me a mild yeast infection. I inserted the product and went to bed. I woke up the next morning with little to no problems. As I was on my way to work, I began to feel and INTENSE ITCH AND BURN. I began scratching like a dog with fleas. I suffered through my work day with repeated trips to the restroom (embarrassing)! I tried using the cream they provided for some relief; however, that just made things worse. I has been TWO DAYS since I used this product and I am still dealing with the intense itch. I'm heading to the Dr. to get a Diflucan Rx...I'll definately be contacting the company about a refund. I WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!"
1,"Burning, itching is unbearable","Bottom line- it's just not worth it. Use the 3 or 7 day versions instead!I, like others on this site, wish I had read these reviews before trying this product. I have a yeast infection, and in the past used the 3 and 7 day Monistat products with very positive results. This, however, is awful. I put it in before bed, used the cream (to hopefully get better sleep), and within a few minutes I felt the burning and increased itching. I immediately took a shower, hoping to wash it all off. I'm not sure if that's the reason, but I began to feel better and went to sleep. Well, it's just a few hours later into the night, and I woke up to the intense burning and itching again. I again hopped in the shower, and am feeling a bit better. I can only wonder how many times I'll need to play this game while the product runs through my system."
1,Get the 3 day treatment....enough said,"Just like the other reviews i read, i read them after i used this product and im up at 2 am with the worst pains ever. I had to wake up and take a azo yeast infection tablet. Thank God i bought azo with this monistat suppository because if not i wouldve suffered for God knows when. Trust me and trust the other 57 people when they tell u this product is too strong and be prepared with azo yeast tablets and or yogurt if u still want to purchase it."
4,the pain was ultimately worth the result,"After multiple vaginal infections/yeast infections, instead of dealing with the doctor I got monistat 1, I received it and that morning I used it, I was at work about 2 hours later and experienced the severe burning and itching that many others described. It was almost unbearable for about an hour but my symptoms have almost completely disappeared within 24 hours. I most definitely would take the hour of burning over dealing with waking up with the burning, swelling, disgusting discharge in the middle of the night. Know what you are going into with this product and the pros will outweigh the cons."
1,BURNING PAIN!!,I just wanted to add I am another victim to the painful burning sensation. This product is horrible. I won't be lazy next time and not call my doctor. NEVER AGAIN!
1,Save your money - This product causes intense burning,"I should have paid attention to the reviews and not use this product. I have used other monistat products with no problems, but this one is terrible. I had the most intense burning I have ever felt and it has lasted for more than 12 hours. It is also very messy and not a good idea for use during the day. I don't typically write reviews but I am writing this one in case I can save someone from the intense burning that I've suffered."
4,Works fine,"I've used this product twice and didn't have a bad reaction either time. If you've actually got a yeast infection, you've already got burning and itching. It clearly states on the packaging that initially, the medication might make it a little worse. It is in no way unbearable. If you've never had an infection before, you need to see a doctor. It sounds like a lot of these people are trying to use this medication to treat bacterial infections, or have abused the product to treat an infection they weren't even sure they had yet.If you're sensitive, have a very mild infection, or have never used a medication like this before, it's obviously not smart to use the harshest product Monistat makes. There's a reason they make 3 and 7 day treatments, and avoiding them because you're ""lazy"" is just stupid."
1,omg,"LADIES/SISTERS! faster is not always better. i wanted to cry, scream and slap somebody. majority wins, go with 3 or more days!"
1,Worst ever!,As some users have noted there are two Monistat 1 products the day/ night and the 1 day. I don't care which one you buy DON'T use it. I did the 1 day combo that included external vulvar itch cream and cool wipes. I inserted it at 11 pm and topped it off with the cream on the outer areas as instructed. Was awakes by 2:30 with burning pain and the worse case of itching I have ever encountered anywhere on my body. Now here I am night two using just the cream and the same thing...excessive itching its so bad I almost want to run to ER but am trying to hold off til morning to avoid long ER wait since this may not seem urgent to ER docs. Bottom line is those of you who are considering this product please don't buy it total waste of $23....smh
4,No burning here.,I am on my second YI in a short time. (Don't think the first one was ever gone) I used a 3day monistat the first time but this one is sooooo much worse I wanted faster releif. I took it at night cause I don't buy the whole use anytime crap. I sleep fine with no burning or problems. It is now night of day two and stuff seems a little better. I think by tomorrow all will be good. This was a bad YI so its doing a great job so far.
1,"Seriously, no.","Alright so I had started out with a pretty bad infection and I wanted to get fast relief. Well this item was not the way to go. I don't know why, but everyone is right. When I first used the Monistat n checked out reviews I was really taken back by all the negative experiences people had. I figured these people were all just exaggerating and being drama queens. I gave this item almost 3 days before I concluded that it just wasn't doing its job. I felt no better and I was really annoyed. So I went out and got the 7 day after peeking many reviews anddddd after just one treatment I feel much better. I'm so relieved. So, my advice is DONT go for the 1 day! Do 7 day!"
1,No stars if that was an option,Worst treatment ever! Never this much itching! Nothing could relieve the amount of burning. I felt a slight uncomfortable itch but after this product I just wanted cry.
3,Not the best route,"I have never had a yeast infection before, so I am not familiar with other yeast infection products. Therefore, I have no comparison to whether this one is good or bad. However, I can tell you my experience using this product has not been the most pleasant one. Inserting the medication was easy and the cream that came along was helpful. But in about 2 hours I had a very annoying burning and itching sensation that was far worse than the yeast infection itself. My boyfriend was unable to even sleep in the same bed with me because I kept twinging. It also leaked quite a bit before i went to bed, so much it got through to my pajama pants. I do not recommend anyone take this during the day, unless they are at home and not going anywhere! I will say that once I finally did get to sleep and woke up I only have very moderate discomfort and feel that the medication is working. I will give an update in about 2-3 days to let you know how everything else worked out."
1,Dont waste your money,"I've attempted to use this brand several times with no results. The external cream burns like no ones business and although the very expensive ovule stays in place, any other type just falls right out. I refuse to buy Monistat ever again."
1,Horrible!,"I have been suffering from yeast infections for the past 10 years. They have gotten more frequent over the past 3 years. I have diagnosed myself many times and have also went to the doctor. I KNOW when I have a yeast infection. I normally do a generic 3 day treatment, but have tried 1 day, 3 day, 5 day and 7 day in generic and name brand. Of all the medications I have used this was by far the worst! 3 days later I ended up buying a generic 3 day treatment to cure the yeast infection. I had a terrible reaction. I had itching, burning,abdominal pain and intense swelling. I actually thought I had a cyst or tumor! I have had 3 children and multiple surgeries including a laparoscopy to remove a softball sized cyst on my ovary. I don't ever take the prescribed pain meds. I have a high pain tolerance, but this medicine made me miserable. It hurt to walk, sit down and to use the bathroom. The worst part is it didn't even cure the infection. Save your money!"
1,THE MOST WRETCHED EXPERIENCE,I will echo many of the other reviews and say that I don't normally write reviews but I feel I must to warn women about this product.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTI had a similar experience to many of the other reviewers for this product. The most excruciating itching and burning I have ever known. I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to put a product with such negative side effects on the shelf but I'd like to see THEM use it. I'm convinced this product was developed by a man. Tossing and turning all night and barely able to sit at my desk the next day is not worth the convenience of a one day application. I will NEVER use this product again as it seem so counter productive to go through itching and burning light years beyond the symptoms of the actual yeast infection itself.WRETCHED!
4,Worked great for me..,"This is the 2nd time I've used this product, each time I find myself terrified about the chance of misery so many women have wrote about, but I've never noticed any negitive side effects from it. I've read that if you don't have a yeast infection it will burn and irritate you so maybe everyone has misdiagnosed themselves?? I would of given it 5stars but it was kind of messy so I gave it 4. But if you truly have a yeast infect I would highly reccomended this product it works very quickly and it reasonably priced."
1,dont use this unless you want a severe reaction,i bought this product and a couple hours later am having an allergic reaction to it. I encourage everyone to write the company and tell them about their experience and to never use monistate products again. chose a different brand that actually has concern for their customers. I am bumming i paid money to have this discomfort. oh did i mention it is three AM...grrrrr
1,Not worth it,"I've had a yeast infection before and usually take the Monistat 7. Sent hubby to the store and he came back with Monistat 1, ticonazole 300 mg (6.5%). Instead of having it returned, I just took it. I inserted it about 8-9 pm. I woke up at 1 am and have been up for two hours with a very uncomfortable vagina. Extreme soreness, burning, hot feeling. It's slowly starting to subside but not worth the lost sleep and anguish. As another reviewer stated, I am calling Monistat directly to get my money back. I will stick with the 7 day treatment."
3,Use at your own Risk!,I'm gonna give this product a 3 because it actually worked but the nasty side effects ruined it for me! I found out the hard way that this treatment is SIGNIFICANTLY stronger than the 3 day or 7 day treatments. I never had problems with the 3 day and 7 day treatments so I figured I would try this and see how it goes. That evil little ovule packs a punch! I took it and decided to lay down and take a nap. Well some of it started seeping out while I was sleeping and I woke up on the verge of screaming! It seriously felt like somebody poured acid into my vagina! Beware!!!
1,Don't buy this product,This is the worst product for yeast infections. It will burn your insides. My ob-gyn confirmed they have heard a lot of negative feedback from their patients.
2,Not worth the pain,"So first off, I have to say that this product did get rid of my yeast infection. I woke up yesterday and knew I had a yeast infection so I schlepped over to my local pharmacy and saw Monistat 1, 3, and 7. I noticed that Monistat 1 said you could take it day or night so I figured I'd get a head start on this thing and treat it as soon as I got home. All was well until about and hour after I inserted the ovule. Holy freaking vagina pain! I could barely take care of my 2 year old. I had to park her in front of the TV with DVRed episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse so I could keep running to the bathroom to deal with my burning and itching vajay. After a few hours and after taking Advil and using Cortizone 10 the pain started to subside. Now this morning I don't have any symptoms of having a yeast infection, so I know the Monistat knocked it out. Was it worth the discomfort HECK NO! Next time, just get the 3 day or 7 day treatment. I've never had a problem with those products."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"I really have nothing to add that hasn't already been said in the reviews, but I am APPALLED that this product is still on the market. My insides felt like they were on fire. NEVER BUY THIS!! If you're like me and are sitting here reading horrible reviews AFTER using Monistat 1, hang in there. For me, the intense burning lasted about 2-3 hours...which is awful enough, but there is an end in sight."
1,Taking Monastat 1 kinda felt like....,"I had not only set my entire vagina on fire but decided to sandpaper off all my skin in the nether regions and proceed to wash salt water over it, while having the inside of my uterus ripped out....Do you think this would feel good??? Most crippling pain I have EVER experienced. I spent half an hour crying in pain, motionless on my bathroom floor. Thank god I had leftover Vicodin from a surgery months ago. It took two pills to go from excruciating pain into a hot burning sensation that persisted for the next day. If I did not have prescription pain killers leftover I would have called my friend to drive me to the ER. I put up with pain fairly well...but this was like nothing I had ever experienced. Ladies PLEASE DO NOT use this product. This medication needs a warning sign....unbelievable."
1,Genuine???,"There is no such thing as ""Genuine NYPD Physical Training T-Shirt"" since the only shirts that are worn and officially recognized by the department are academy shirts with last name and company number on front and rear. There are NYC Licensed NYPD Shirts, but none designated as Genuine PT shirts - merchant needs to revamp description since it is misleading.Retired NYPD9/11 Recovery Team"
5,Success,"After reading this book, I felt that the SAT is really a stratagic test, knowing what to do and how to do it the right way. I can't exactly tell how much it improved my score but with other material it helped my overall score from a 900 to an 1100. I feel that this book was a big chunk in this score. It's a cheap and easy way to improve you score."
4,"good practice, but a little too good...","This book is very beneficial to someone who is studying for the SAT I for the first time. The tests, since they are real, show the reader exactly what the test is like. I started using this book a month before the test. I was scoring in the 1500's on the tests in this book, so I started to slack off and get cocky. Test day came, and I ended it with a mid-1400. For someone shooting for a 1500, this is quite a dissappointment. The book is very good, but should be used in conjunction with other test-prep books, preferrably Barron's, to keep you working hard for your goal."
3,Good for practice tests - but not that great for hints,"This book is good to know where you sit score wise on the SAT, but not realy so great on hints. If you want to know how to ""beet the system"" look for Cracking the SATs by Princeton Review. Amazon.com has it."
1,Want to take more SATs than you have to?,"SAT scores are not that important. It's a test that judges nothing and is wastefully meaningless. Spending time taking outdated SAT tests to ""up your score"", rather than playing outside with your dog is a waste. You'll get into a College you love, and learn many great things. Save the money and get a life!"
5,Best SAT I Study Guide,"This is not a book to help you crack the SAT I. It gives you 10 real tests from the past, so you know exactly what to expect on your own SAT I. Many of the questions will probably show up again in future tests. But the real help comes from allowing you to be totally familiar with the SAT I.Ten years ago I used this book to help me get a 680 on the verbal section - just a year after I came to America and started learning English. My advice: take all the tests, analyze what you missed, and you'll see the results!"
4,"Lighten up, people!","Really, this movie is hilarious. I read some of the other reviews and... honestly, did you think you were sitting down to watch 'Citizen Kane'? 'Casasblanca'?It's just a lighthearted teen comedy and on that level, it's awesome. Plus, it makes fun of Texas AND France in the same movie! (Two worthy targets, indeed! FYI, that's called ""satire"" for those reviewers who just don't seem to ""get it"".)Adjust your expectations properly and enjoy.."
3,Stupid but funny,"It's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it's certainly worth some stupid laughs."
2,I watched because I like Piper Perabo...,"My husband or kids would have never sat through that. It was truly lackluster. Maybe if you want to see a 'french introvert' turn into a sexual cheerleader for about 10 seconds, but seriously....it would be better skipping it and doing something better. ANYTHING is better than this movie."
2,Epitomizes every bad aspect of teen movies.,"Though the individual performances by the actors in this movie were were well played, the script was terribly lacking. Everyone expects a teen movie such as this to be comprised entirely of various highschool stereotypes, however in this case, most of them were so far over the top that they lost their real comedic effect. Also, several characters do everything but stay consistent with who the character really is. For example, the excessively stereotypical photographer, social outcast, self-hating, [bad]-car-driving character who hates everything about everyone falls in love with Starla (Barbie-type character), who excessively embodies everything that he really hates.Overall, this movie had a premise that started off with a little promise, but ended up wandering around in so many circles that it leaves viewers scratching their heads, wondering where the story went."
2,"Potentially good, Doesnt deliver","She gets what she wants is a flimsy movie that has potential but it never fulfills it. It's not that funny and the characters are so annoying. It plays into Texas stereotypes, which is getting old and lacks in humor. I wanted more, but by the end I knew why it wasnt released in theaters."
3,A oui teen comedy...mwah!,"The only actor I recognize from seeing this promising hilarious trailer is Piper Perabo who made an impressive screen presence in my opinion in ""Coyote Ugly"". This time she plays second fiddle to the main character of the movie who suddenly despises ""Perabo's"" character. ""Slap Her She's French"" is an odd film but I do plan to check it out."
2,What was the point?,I suppose there was a reason to this film I could just never figure it out. The acting was decent but the story line was ridiculous. I generally like quirky off-beat stories/movies but I think this one was trying too hard to be offbeat and quirky and it ended up just being silly.
5,Oscar & Lucinda,Supurb acting by two of my favorite actors. It held my interest throughout. I was surprised by the ending.Diana E.
4,A very different story!,"Intriquing script and well done acting. Not your typical,run of the mill, predictible story-line. This was just a good movie from beginning to end. Captivating performances from both lead actors. They really got into their characters. If you have ever gambled or know anyone who had an addiction to gambling (or addicted to anything for that matter), watch this one, it probes and stimulates the mind. The symbolism of the Glass Church is really interesting. There are a lot of religous twists and turns in this movie. Anyone who has ever struggled with religous inner-conflicts and doctrines will also like the innuendo's in this flick."
3,Oscar and Lucinda,"I found that the main characters were not always together which made it harder for me to like it. Also, the most exciting parts of the movie are practically all in the trailer so the parts that are left are much more quiet and less exciting."
4,Oscar and Lucinda,I very much enjoyed this video. It is well written and superbly acted. The ending is beautiful. The only fault I might have is that it does not do justice to the book from which it came.
2,Loses Steam,"This film starts out so promising - interesting characters, slightly hynotic opening, unconventional story line. And then, after the first hour, it all falls apart. I slowly cared little for the main characters, which makes the end of the film seem entirely unplausible and somewhat ridiculous. Two fine leads, but the writing and the drama eventually go nowhere."
5,Simply Breathtaking,"Fiennes and Blanchette, two of today's most talented actors star in this beautiful adaptation of Peter Carey's moving novel, Oscar and Lucinda. Although there were some technical mistakes made by the director and editors of this film, the audience easily forgets them because of the tremendous acting performances.Ralph Fiennes is Oscar thru and thru-he completely transformed himself into the character. His performance was seamless."
1,The book is better.,"This film is based on one of my favourite books, so I was really looking forward to seeing it. Despite great performances by Blanchett and Fienes, it just doesn't hold together well. Too much of what is in the book has been left out and that which is there lacks weight. The characters in the book are so much more complex and endearing. The book was very moving and engaging while the movie is not. There is also an ending tacked on that doesn't exist in the book, and that always annoys me. I was very disappointed. I think had I not read the book, I'd have stopped watching the movie about 1/3 into it."
3,OSCAR AND LUCINDA,The delivery was excellent but the DVD was dry and i found uninteresting.I just could not get into the story.
1,I Hate This Movie,"Look, if you really want to see an amazing piece of Fiennes work from this period of his career, go English Patient, yes I know it's cliché and maybe you've already scene it but it's so damned good. See it again."
3,Bless You! B. Lawson Thornton,"The book was fun to read. I read the whole book in one setting. A lot of the scenes were believable except. How often and easy she could put someone out of her home. I firsthand dealt with a physically abusive husband and I could never get him to leave. I and my children always had to leave, and we would always return that is until enough was enough! I really enjoyed the courtroom scene. I couldn't wait to turn to the next page to see what else was going to happen. Bless you B. Lawson Thornton for realizing that you have a special gift and thank you for sharing it with the world especially me!"
5,Delightful!,"This is a therapeutic, inspirational tale of the trials and tribulations that many have been subjected to. I applaud this young writer for developing this exceptionally profound work of art!"
3,OK NOVEL,WELL I HAVE TO SAY I THINK THIS BOOK WAS OK.I GIVE IT THREE STARS.I JUST THINK THEIR WAS ALOT OF THINGS MISSING FROM THIS NOVEL.I KEPT ASKING MYSELF! WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS CHARACTER AT THE END.BUT I LOVE NEW AUTHORS SO I HAVE TO SAY .KEEP THE BOOKS COMING OK.
3,Hard to get into...,"I had such high hopes for this one, but I couldn't make it past the third page... I know I'm in the minority on this one, as everyone else seems to love the book... Maybe in a couple months, I'm going to try again to read it. Wish me luck!"
4,Nice tongs,"I bought this, because we have one that we use all the time and often need a 2nd tongs. I have had the other for a couple years and wanted the same kind. The new one doesn't seem quite as sturdy, but so far it is working fine."
2,DIsagree with this as a recommended product,"I was looking for a long pair of tongs and this came with a positive review in a magazine. I made the purchase and after the first use, the rubber tip came off. They also can easily pinch your fingers...I would keep looking for another set of tongs."
4,Great Kitchen Tool,I've used a pair of these tongs for years. One of the ends of my tong is becoming worn so I'm ordering more. I think they are great.
1,the worst item ever don't waste ur money,"This is the worst product ever, I have extremly curly hair and it did nothing but tangle and knot my hair and made it even more frizzy. I would not recomend buying it to anyone, and i tried using it more than once and that didn't help any so please do not purchase this item and if you do be prepared to take it back."
1,terrible product,I have wavy hair and I thought this could help styling it a little. Not only it is difficult to use but also it got my hair all tangled I had a difficult time trying to get my hair out of the machine. I feel that using a normal brush and dryer is a lot easier. Don't waste your money
5,Excellent Device,"The Revo Styler captured my interest years ago when I first saw the infomercial on it. Recently I received it as a gift and I can't say enough about how well it works.My hair is quite fine and it's difficult to style in a manner that shows bounce and shine. The Revo Styler is at first tricky to use but once you get the hang of it, it's as simple as ever to use. The results that I've gotten everytime are like never before when I do my own hair. I have more fullness, body and shine to my hair now. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who has hair!"
1,THE WORST PRODUCT,This product did nothing that it was suppose to do. It got tangled in hair and we almost had to cut my hair to get it out. I advise you not to buy this product it is a waste.
1,A bit sceptical,I don't know about this product. I went to Amazon and Jayashree's review was there-- verbatim. I'm wondering if she works for the company because not I'm not sure if I want a product that might rip out my hair.
1,Yuck!,"This product sucks, It either tanged my hair or did nothing, I would not recommend this to anyone.I have thick wavy/curly hair, and now I have a Conair straightner, which does not tangle my hair in knots, and actually does a good job >_>"
3,Works good other than fitting sticks in slots!,The sticks are way too snug going into the slots. Getting them out is worst. I though about filing them a little wider but haven't had the time so I have just been setting a timer and putting the sticks in right before the liquid freezes. Works great other than the slot issue.
4,How to paint on anything that looks like glass....,"This book gives you inspiration to use anything that looks like glass around the home, Ferrero Rocher plastic box, glass box, bottles, acetate, and makes you want to do your windows and mirrors.....! The artist teaches you with available tools around your home and it is relieving to know that you don't have to have this and that tool before embarking on a simple project that may take you just a day to finish. Patterns are given and you are taught how to make your own too, definitely a fail-proof manual and reference book that you would find hard to keep on the shelf...!"
2,Predictable,"This last book in her Bardic Voices series was very predictable--I had already figured out who the murderer was by the seventh chapter. But then in the next chapter, she told who it was. The book might have been better if she had left the reader in the drak for most of the book like most mysteries are. Also, this story line was not what I was expecting at all. I had loved the other books in this series, but this one didn't seem like part of the series at all. It had a darker undertone and would have seemed more in place in New York or San Francisco. I didn't get the ""fantasy"" feel from this book. Sure, magic was mentioned, but it didn't seem to fit the story line at all."
3,For fans of more than Fantasy,This was actually the first of the Bardic Voices books that I read. I enjoyed it enough that I immediately bought the other books. Book 4 is able to stand on its own as a fantasy/mystery novel. I am a fan of mysteries as well as fantasies and this book was a nice combination of the two. I really liked the investigator and hope for more to come from Lackey about these new characters.
1,No subtitles,"Beware, this title has no subtitles so its worth less for non-english speakers.Amazon is an International Shop, so this information is a must.Great video quality tough!!!"
5,Animal Planet had outdone itself!,"'Whale Wars' is not merely an exciting documentary series. It is a video catalog of history in the making. Those who haven't seen it, shall soon be a minority."
5,Great Snack Item For Everyone,"Great snack or munchy item, or anything, just a little spice and lots of variety. Non-gluten and more!"
1,What are the ingredients?,I would buy these if I knew what the ingredients and nutritional values were.Why aren't they listed on all food products?I can't find the web-site for this company to find this out myself.Amazon please put up the ingredients!
4,paper toel holder,"attractive, convenient, saves room on the table. Arrived quickly from Amazon. I bought two for family members"
1,Very disappointed,"This was a terrible purchase. Once assembled, it wobbles. Changing the paper towels is not an easy process. The design is poor. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Great Magic Trick for My 8 yr Old Daughter,"We were very happy this product. My 8 yr old daughter, who loves magic, was the hit of our Christmas gathering performing the 5 tricks she got from Santa! This trick is easy to learn and really impressed all the adults at the party. I noticed some reviewers felt the price was too high, but it is worth it for a quality trick that was easy for my daughter to perform. We also purchased the following and together they made for a great show: Magic Makers Trick Magnets, Empire Magic Nickels to Dimes Trick, Color Changing Hanky, and The Magic Stick."
3,Good for kid parties,I bought this to use at my daughter's 5th birthday party coming up. I tried it on my kids and they loved it. The quality could have been better for the price
2,Not what I was expecting,"I thought it would have nice, soft songs. But, it is riddled with annoying sound effects and strange instrumentation."
1,Cheesy Remakes,"Do not be misled by the ""original artist"" claimsof this CD; they are remakes lacking themagic of the oldies."
2,Heavier weight than glasses of same brand already have.,"I ordered these glasses as a gift. They were to be replacements for some of a set that had gotten broken. When they arrived they are stamped Reed and Barton instead of Miller Rogaska on bottom and they are a heavier, thicker glass. The description should have been the same but on the picture supplied you cannot see the stamp. These will probably be returned."
1,Not A Set Of 4,"I saw this and immediately went to the site to order the set. Unfortunately, it is not a set. It is one glass."
3,fabulous toy!!,I bought this toy and am so glad I did. It's fantastic. The details are spectacular. I am now a huge playmobil fan and my children love it too.
1,Poorly made toy,This is the first time that I Have written a review on any item. That should tell you how poorly this toy is made and how dis-satisfied that I am with it .This toy fell apart on the 2nd day we had it. It is a cheaply made toy. I would not recommend this to anyone
3,A Brain for All Seasons: Human Evolution and Abrupt Climate Change,"The book is in fact a collected of notes and thoughts about various aspects of human evolution and its ""actors"". It is written rather to give some ideas for individual thinking than a comprehensive study of the subject introduced by the title. Unfortunately the book contains some mistakes (e.g. Homo sp. in Europe is not older than 1.0 Ma and absolutely not 1.7 Ma as stated on the page 39).Nevertheless it could make a good reading for students and non-specialists interested in the subject. Remember, do not read this book without any additional source reading."
2,disjointed? Hard for me to get through,"I purchased this book on a friend's recommendation as an accessible, easy-to-read book (we both really enjoyed ""Guns Germs and Steel""). However, I had a hard time following this author in his discussions as he travels. I wasn't sure of the point he was trying to make in the chapters. I applaud the author for attempting to describe his theory at a laymen's level, but I'm not sure he was successful."
5,"This works with Win7, 64 bit","Use this to install your parallel printer. In my case an HP Laserjet IIP. This is plug and play. The only catch is that you must set the port configuration. To do so look here: http://www.ehow.com/how_6928259_do-printer-port-lpt1-usb_.html. (I could not uncheck the lpt port but when I checked the virtual port the lpt port was automatically unchecked).Note that this is a usb 1 standard. Beside the 6 usb ports it has pin connections for legacy mouse and keyboard. Also note that this is a 25 pin parallel plug, hence the db25"
3,Good choice,A good starter for those who have never used excel. Much better than microsoft excel help.
4,good for a beginner,"I have some experience and picked through the book for things I did not know about. A lady that I work with is a true beginner and is learning a lot from the book. It is an older version than I planned to buy and some of the menu's are not exactly the same. All in all, great for a beginner, and not too bad for someone with a little experience."
2,Not what I had in mind,"This book is not indexed. It is apparently meant to be taken as a course from start to finish. Otherwise, logical organization is lacking if one wishes to look up how to do a certain thing.If you have no experience with any computer spreadsheet program, you might like the book. It gets you started. But, be aware you will need to set aside some time and proceed from cover to cover.If you have experience with any computer spreadsheet, I advise you try another book and author."
4,Reference tool,I have used this book primarily as a reference tool and it works well for those new to excel
4,Good book,"I thought it would be a little more ""to the point."" I have things I need to get done and it takes time to look for the answers. I'm lazy and want easy answers.....not a novel to read."
5,"'living in the heart""",this is a great book writtin by Durnvalo Melchizedek a book to help find the place in the heart that connect us with the universe (god) the flower of life is so wonderful!
5,Another world,This is a terrific book! Drunvalo Melchizedek's book on living in the heart and accompanying meditation takes you to another world.
5,Living in the Heart: How to Enter into the Sacred Space Within the Heart (,"Totally amazing book. It will open your eyes in so many ways. This is also a very intense book, for Drunvalo is a very strong spiritual warrior. I recommend this book for all on the path of enlightenment."
4,Interesting,I wanted to love this but some of the info is too far out there to sound believable to me. Maybe my mind is to based in science and therefore can't open to the concepts presented in this book. A friend who read it got more out of it than I did.
5,Love the Meditation,Drunvalo is an amazing teacher. This book comes with a guided meditation that will knock your socks off. Check him out on youtube for some great teachings.
4,Visually Impressive.,"Glass Fleet is the story Michel and Cleo trying to free the galaxy from the tyranny of the empire. It's kinda like star wars. If Darth Vader were gay and had braids there wouldn't be much difference. There a lot of interesting characters in this anime. There is a good mix of action and drama. The most impressive aspects of this anime are the animation quality and the space battles. It's a unique anime series and there aren't too many other series that are all that similar. I really enjoyed watching this anime. As I said the characters are the best part of Glass Fleet. The bad guy is so bad that you'll wanna fight him yourself, and the heroes will make you wanna strap up and go to bat with them. Overall Glass Fleet is a solid anime. I'd say that my only complaint is the sick little pervert that always follows Vetti, the bad guy, around everywhere. He's pretty sickening. Glass Fleet will probably be a good addition to your collection. It's not a bad price either."
2,A Very Boring Space Opera..,Length:: 3:41 MinsThis is just a ramble about the box set of Glass Fleet by Funimation and produced by Gonzo. Mainly my opinions on it as a show.
4,Glass Fleet a welcome in my collection,"I found this to be a wonderful tale, a great lengthly story of a multitude of interesting charactersIt has nice action and very well drawn at least its in more of the middle style of sharp meets curved *sweet* not overly realistic but never fakeIf you have seen the Trigun series and enjoyed the characters thoughts outlining personal dilemma hopes dreams that are in the series you will find the same in glass fleetI would suggest this to anyone and hope for you to enjoy it as i have."
2,This almost adequately satisfying,"This was the first anime I have ever bought. My girlfriend has let me borrow countless, so I figured, ""Hey, I'll buy one."" I began watching trailers on youtube to see which I should purchase, and this trailer looked absolutely amazing! DON'T buy into the trailer. IT'S A TRAP! This is kind of like the French Revolution, but in space, where people can breath in this vast vacuum of darkness. Also, not to nag on everything, but the main villains sidekick was a girl? No, a little homosexually needy boy named....wait for it...Ralph. However, this is sometimes really fun to watch due to its shear stupidity. There was a point where the main villain and hero clashed in a epic battle in the snow....what happened? There shirts exploded off their body. Honestly, it's a goofy anime and it's not all that bad, but seriously, don't buy it. Rent it, or borrow it from a friend. Buy something else instead."
2,More than disappointed,"I don't even know why or how she was able to release a cd. I will probably listen to her whole cd one time, before it will never get played again."
3,Linatone,I don't know what else is in the product besides omega 3but my dogs cannot take it. It makes them throw up. I give themFish Oil.
2,Shed Relief Plus,My egyptian mau won't have anything to do with this stuff. I've tried straight and mixed in food. No luck. It was a waste of money. Maybe it's just my cat or maybe it's more suited to dogs since typically they aren't as finicky as cats.
3,I notice no difference.,"First make sure you check the size. I thought from the picture I ordered the larger bottle. Second I have never noticed that it helps with shed control. I have a "" Special "" cat that we put this in her food so she can eat it better."
1,Not the correct product,"I have been using the gold label Linatone pictured here, on my shih Tzu rescue since February 2012. She had severe dermititis when I adopted her due to flea infestation and it worked wonders on her. But my vet no longer carries it, he only has the purple label which is for skin and shedding and for my purposes, not as effective. I ordered the gold label from here but received the purple label instead. I think that the sellers need to adjust the photo they have here to avoid such confusion in the future."
4,Educational reading,"The author reveals a lifestyle quite unlike American or European living. It is frightening to read about the amount of control a govenment can have over a person. Then, when the author was trying to reveal his secret it was startling to read about the amount of doubt he received from the US forces. A good read."
2,Buy it in paperback,"The salient fact is that Saddam didn't have weapons of mass destruction. Duh. Since everyone knows that already, the book needed to provide something more. But while the story is kind of interesting (after you get past the first 20 pages), it is too short on intrigue and too long on details such as where materials were purchased and from whom. A sense of the imminent danger felt by this scientist should have been the easiest thing to convey about his life in Iraq under Saddam. But I consistently felt that the author was manufacturing drama. I was never scared for him. Not once.This book should have been a long magazine article. Read it in the bookstore, or wait until it comes out in paperback."
5,Retro from Tampa,"This is an extremely interesting and timely book that makes the case that Saddam was both dillusional and determined to build the bomb. The author describes Saddam's intent to wait out the U.N. and then reconstitute his program, and he clearly states that Iraq would have been able to shave months if not years off the delivery of a nuclear bomb.Saddam, like Hitler in the 20s and early 30s, was clearly a grave and gathering threat who would threaten the world with WMD. This story actually cooberates the Administrations claim that Iraq could have reconstituted its program in months, and with the acquisition of a small amount of enriched uranium or plutonium, threatened the world.Finally, the author makes clear that Saddam had the intent to build a bomb, and certainly the money to acquire fissile material from the corrupt oil for food program. Waiting, as Kerry now suggests he would have done, until the threat was imminent, would be too late.Thank you for an excellent book."
3,Good but long,I liked the book however I let misspellings & missed words divert me. The story of his wife's battle with cancer & seeking the killers were good but felt could have been condensed into about half the size of the book.
5,Great and educational!,I bought this for my daughter's class as they study animals this year. What a great educational tool it is for them.
5,A must have for the Playmobil Knight theme,"My 3rd old son received this accessory set for Xmas and loves it. Since he has the Dragon knights as his bad guys, this was a perfect match. The set comes with two cannon balls that are easy for a kid to load themselves and easy to discharge (battery-free). Small enough to take along somewhere too for more knight action. The knights that come with it are the same dragon knights from the other sets, giving you more men to battle. There are some small pieces so if you have a mouther, keep them put away. Durable, colorful, and made in Europe."
2,Straps Material Flimsy,"We've had a lot of straps over time, but these seem flimsy. If I knotted the straps after using the clip, they come loose."
2,"Great buckle, but NOT heavy duty straps","I bought a Yakima kayak rack 2 years ago and love it! However, one strap had worn, so I ordered the Yakima Heavy Duty replacement straps, naturally. Caution: same great buckle, but the straps were MUCH lighter duty than the origional straps. Useing a Starrett micrometer, the origional straps measured .072 in thickness while the replacement straps measured only .039 thickness. After only one use, the new strap is showing wear...what a disappointment. Oh yeah, on the flip side, the replacement straps are about 4 feet longer than the origional straps, but I didn't need more length...I'm transporting a kayak, not a Boston Whaler!"
5,These are replacements for my current straps,"I've had the same Yakima straps for more than 16 years and one of the buckles finally broke. I bought these to replace the broken one. I'm using these to tie down surf boards. The straps were a little bit longer than what I bought way back when, so I cut a strap to the size I needed, and put a match to the end of it so that it wouldn't unravel (a great reason for having nylon). The straps aren't as heavy as they were in 1989, but that's to be expected. Overall, they work well for me."
5,Awesome,"This make up I feel performs better than bareminerals or bareescentuals. You can't beat the price either for the quality. I am a black woman and the shade, Dark, matched my skin perfectly, even though the pictorial representation of it on Amazon is a bit exaggerated."
4,"Nice, but no Bare Essentials","I like Bare Essentials more, but Pur has a compact and I needed one because I have oily skin."
1,I am rating the service not the product; the product is fine.,"I immediately decided to cancel the order. It was after hours, so sent e-mail and left phone message. When they called back they told me item could not be canceled, had already been shipped. Guess what--it has been a week, and I still have not received the item. I will never never never buy from this seller again.The product is fine, however. I have used it before and like it better than other mineral make-ups."
4,Great Watch !!!,"I love this watch cause it has a lot of gadgets for a small price. The best one is the tele-memo feauture!!!! The only thing wrong with the watch is that is has a crystal that scratches very easy. Other than that what more can you ask for from a inexpensive watch !!!!! Oh, one last thing I asked Casio what HD stands for and the company rep said in ane-mail that he checked with Japan Casio and they have no idea yet the put it on the watch LOL!!! Anyone know what the HD on the watch means let me know LOL!!!!!Mitch :)"
4,Nice Middleground Between Cloth & Modern Diapers,"We've found other diapers that are more absorbent and better-fitting, but Tushies are the only ones that don't irritate our baby's sensitive skin. Cloth diapers were ideal, but Tushies are much more absorbent and convenient."
3,GEL FREE!,"My wife pushed for the use of these diapers, because they are gel free, which is so much better for our baby. Our daughter who will be a year this week has only soaked through a diaper once. They absorb a lotThe only problems I have with these diapers are that they cost a lot more than gel diapers, only come in 4 sizes, and that the tape at times has riped off the diaper (has happend to many times for the cost we pay!)When all is said and done, these Tushies are wonderful because they are gel free!"
5,Great simple book on color management,"Simple to read book explaining color management. If you're looking for a technical manual full of design specs, buy something else. If you're looking for an easy to read non-techy book that explains how human color vision works, how color management in the digital world is used and the how/why of applying it, buy this book. Given the low price used, it's a ""must have"" book for digital photographers. Once I read this, I finally understand what hundreds of technically written web sites failed to get across. I just thought I underastood what this book simply explains is normal plain english. Like I said, maybe a techy person would find this book wordy?"
2,Good book if you are searching for a step by step guide.,"I was really disapointed by the book. I wanted something that would have been closer to the theories and technicals aspects of color profiles. This is mainly a step by step book to follow with specific software (or even hardware) to reach some goal. It is very software and hardware specific - not generic. I learned more about ""how color profiles works together"" on websites than in the book."
5,Just What You need,"This is exactly what I was looking for; it gives a quick in-and-out overview of colour management, with detailed information about calibration and profiles. Other books on this topic are twice the size, which I don't think is necessary for most people.It goes into very good detail, with task-by-task instructions, and is well-organised and clear (One reviewer claims that it was ""poorly edited and conceived""; I didn't have any of the problems they did)."
5,Excellent book,"This is the best book that I have used on this subject. Clear explanations, illustrations, etc."
4,Four out of five stars,"I'm new to color management, and this book does a great job of demystifying the subject, not only explaining the concepts but showing how to apply them. My only complaint about the Kindle edition is that the Photoshop screenshots are unreadable. I contacted the publisher asking if high-resolution screenshots were available on the publisher's Web site, but did not get a reply."
5,Excellent,A really very useful book that explains a complex subject about as clearly as you could hope for. Covers a great range of topics beyond color management. I highly recommend this book.
5,Arrived exactly as described,"The book, Tionesta Valley Railroad by Walter Cassler, arrived well packaged and in the time frame predicted. The condition was exactly as described and as I would have expected for a well cared for publication of it's age especially given that it has been out of print for some time. There is a little rust on the staples in the binding and a slightly musty smell, but it is otherwise in near perfect condition as far as I can determine.I have been searching for it for some time and am very happy to have finally found it in such good condition."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"This software does not run on any current operating system. Not Mac OSX (Leopard), not on Microsoft Windows Vista. The Macintosh version is for Mac OS 9, or the classic mode in Mac OS X (which does not exist any longer). It also will not install on Vista either. Don't buy it, a waste of your hard earned money!"
3,Some things wrong here,"Make sure you read the description. I didn't and thought I was buying a book, what I got was a CD/DVD and since I have Windows Vista I couldn't read the disk. I don't blame the seller I should have read the description."
1,Do not condone this behavior,"I bought this series for my adultndaughter. I curse that day! The quality is great for the product but what a horrible bunch of people! Like the Simpsons created a lazy bunch who were proud of their lack of ambition, this series creates a bunch of irresponsible parents who believe domestic violence is a way of life."
4,Quick,"Arrived very quickly!Purchased in Australia, wasn't expecting it to arrive for like a month (i choose the cheap posting stuff) it arrived like two days later!Quite an entertaining show too."
1,all discs were scratched and wouldnt play,Not worth the money i was so excited to receive these. But when i tried to play each episode they were all not playing.. Very disapointing. I would think twice before ordering from amazon again .
4,Good Reference Material,"Osprey (Men-at-Arms Series) is a good reference source. Model builders/figure painters will especially find the color plates useful. I am using mine as a color guide to paint WWII Romanian Infantry, but anyone who wishes to sculpt their own figures, or create scenarios for battles (using the organization information) will also find it useful."
4,Would you like a copy for free?,"This is a quite good book for people interested in the subject. But you don't need to spend money to have it. The author is giving it away for free on his own site (Xitelco company), you can download it for free in pdf format.Very interesting policy...."
4,Great for kids age 6-10,"my 6 year old son loves these books and goes through them very quickly. He likes the ""silly"" antics of the main characters."
4,"Great Collection, Great Price",My son is a big fan of these books. He's slowly evolving in chapter books and these books supply a lot of pictures along with the words.
5,The captain underpants review,Captain underpants is a funny book. It is filled with flip-o-rama which show the battles like real movies. The characters they make are really good. The parts that I like about it are the parts where the bad guys lose. And it is a really good book that other kids should read.
4,El canon argentino del siglo XX,"Mi nombre es Guillermo y vivo en Buenos Aires, Argentina. Espero que este libro sea comprado por mucha gente porque para nosotros sería más que interesante que en el mundo sean leídos dos de nuestras figuras intelectuales más influyentes de nuestro siglo."
5,I have had a time machine...,I would send this book to myself when my kids were infants. Great guidance.
3,Super Reader,"In the Way of the Scarlet Pimpernel a young woman tries to rescue a friend of hers from those dastardly employers of the guillotine. A little naive, she believes some documents she has in her possession will give her the leverage necessary.The Committee are not rookies at the game of underhandedness and subterfuge, and she is facing a neck shortening herself. The Pimpernel must come to the rescue!"
3,Not Exactly What it Looks Like,"The quality of this item was acceptable to me. The big problem was that it did not come with the ""shown"" grease fitting. I had to install this ball joint and I wanted a grease fitting in it. I had to drill and tap a hole in it and install a fitting that I had in stock. All in all everything turned out fine except for the extra labor that I had to eat."
2,STUUUUUUPID,All the colleges in this book were in the middle of nowhere. That's why they are best buys. I gave this to Goodwill since I sure as hell won't be able to resell it.
3,Decent Study Aid,"This is a very comprehensive guide to corporations, whixh deals with all the legal aspects of organizing, maintaiing, and regulating a corporation, including that elusive ""piercing the corporate veil"" concept. However, if you are using this for a business law exam study aid, you will need to supplement it. There is nary a word in it regarding agency or partnership, which any comprehensive business law survey course will most certainly touch on. If it had, I would have given it five stars. Just be warned when ordering--it isn't all there."
4,Ideal for exam prep,Excellent book - I am glad I picked it up. It is concise and yet comprehensive - would definitely recommend it .
2,Not organized for learning - very outline like,"This may be a fairly comprehensive overview of corporate law - but it's just not structured well for learning. I prefer the Issues and Explanations series of books because they give you different 'real world' or at least some examples of how the different rules might interact with the real world. they help you think and practice what you just read. This book is just page after page of outlined summarized facts of corporate law. You can get other people's (ie law students') corporate law outlines off the internet and have pretty much the same thing. The book does have a few 'essay' questions, but they are pretty short and very simple. There is nothing in this book beyond that designed to help you learn. If you want to pay $$ for a lists of providing information - then this is book for you. I suggest though, save your $ on this one, get some free outlines and the Issues and Explanations book."
2,"Worked somewhat well for five years with problems, then failed","The idea is great, and when this attractive mister worked, it was excellent. However, it frequently emitted the olive oil (we never used it for anything else) in a thin stream instead of a mist. When that happened, I tried to clean the spray valve to no avail, then suddently it would mist again. The pump mechanism (manual) is somewhat difficult to create adequate pressure, and we suspect persons with arthritic hands would not be able to use it. After somewhat satisfactory use for about five years, it failed completely. So maybe we did get our money's worth all things considered. Am now looking for a better model as a replacement."
1,Stupid Piece of Tin,"This is the most useless tool ever! I got this last Christmas and it was in the garbage by Valentines day. It leaks, and gets rusty. It get clogged very easy and does not spray like it is meant to. Don't waste your monsy on this piece of trash."
1,Leaks,Not worth the money. Used it a few months and noticed I kept having circles of liquid smoke inside my cupboard plus the smell of the liquid smoke. I did not overfill the sprayer. Put it in a plastic bag in the cupbaord but I still had the smell and the plastic bag was wet inside. I figured out it was leaking out the bottom; turned the sprayer sideways and it poured out easily from the bottom seam. Will try the other brand and hopefully it works better because this does come in handy.
2,Do not recommend,"We wanted to like this and actually had it for 3+ years, but had problems with it all the while. The bottom rounded out (so it does not sit even), basically the problem is it doesn't handle pressure very well. Try another brand."
2,"Same experience, exactly, as Jerry's","My pump just up and quit after several years...and it didn't always work great, but when it did, it was ideal.So I'll replace it, but with some other product, not the Cuisipro again."
1,poor construction,"I started to use this for spraying Olive Oil. After the first spray attempt, the bottom fell out. I will be exchanging this product for something constructed better."
2,"Not for the weak at heart, physically","I read about this product being ""recommended"" by American's Test Kitchen in a survey by their company. I am a senior citizen and regard anything that can reduce food costs a primary budget item. Not having to buy Pam was my main reason for purchasing this product.The problem arises when you have to repeatedly pump the flask to get the end results of a spray like Pam. This isn't effective unless you pump energetically for at least 30 seconds and not for people with arthritis like myself. The fifteen pumps as recommended in the instructions does not work.It was a great idea but a waste of money since I could of bought several cans of Pam for the same price."
1,Leakage,"While I was following the instructions to clean this product, it was leaking air before getting to 5 pumps. 10 pumps would almost take the top off. Sort of sprays water, but dribbles oil, as there is no pressure able to build."
2,"Clogs, mold grows inside","I thought I liked this mister. I could deal with the clogging, just rinse it out and it seemed to work ok again. I clean it about twice a month by completely emptying it of oil and washing with with dish soap. Today, I looked inside and saw dark blotches on the outside of the plastic inner bottle, but inside the stainless exterior. I used a small flashlight to get a better view, and I was shocked to see that it was clumps of mold. It is impossible to take it apart to get it out of there. It makes me sick to think I could have been spraying my family's food with contaminated oil, and who knows how long!"
3,Pretty and comfortable but too narrow for me,"I'm petite with a small wrist; I thought this bracelet was pretty but, surprisingly, too narrow for my liking. I prefer the 5.5 mm width bracelet in the same style. Someone wanting a narrow bracelet will like this. This bracelet would also look good layered with other fairly thin bracelets."
3,very upset,i ordered this for my wife and were supposed to get it by the 11th. its the 12th and well its still in transit. im very upset that i was told a date and its been exceeded. everything else i have ordered has came early. i dont understand!
4,The single that caught my eye....and ears!,"This was the first Jamiroquai single I heard and I thought it was great. After buying the single, I then heard a few other Jamiroquai singles and decided to buy ""travelling without moving"" which is an excellent album. I recommend this single because it is one of JK's best.If you love Jamiroquai, then get his new album ""a funk odysey""-that's great as well."
3,It is not original to make a 1979 disco style song in 1999,"Nice song, but it is not original at all to make a 1979 disco style song in 1999. Jamiriquai is almost as good as a white funk band as Level 42 used to be in the 80's, but the latter were much more original!"
3,Mediocre,"A good biochemial and molecular nutrition book is hard to come by. This one is mediocre at best. The carbohydrate and amino acid chapters are complicated and lethargic to read. What few diagrams do exist in the book often have errors. The other chapters are easier to read, but not divided well by subtopics. A glossary would be nice.A good supplement to this is Lippincotts Illustrated Reviews: Biochemistry. It particularly makes the macronutrient metabolic pathways for fatty acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates easier to understand."
5,The first album I ever bought...,"...and everyone thought I was nuts because they had never heard any of the songs. A couple of decades later, ""A Little Less Conversation"" and ""Rubberneckin"" finally got their due in the form of remixes. I still prefer the original versions found on this collection, though. By the way, Paul, the track listing here on Amazon is incorrect. ""Stay Away"" was on the original release, too. ""Stay Away, Joe"" is on the soon-to-be-released ""Let's Be Friends"", also from the Camden catalog."
3,Little bit of an error....,"Great nostalgic Cd, along with Flaming Star. Only problem is the last track is titled Stay Away, Joe, but we get Stay Away instead, which is a totally different song, albeit from the same movie. Apart from that not bad for a seven bucks cd"
3,Retract prior review/comments,I had left a prior comment on this item by mistake. It happened to be a different item purchased from another vendor. This item happened to be as expected. Very good.
3,"Not great, But good","Not too crazy about ALL of the tracks, but a couple real good songs are on this cd"
4,Peculiar Paradise,I understand now from a friend it is a text book that was required reading at PSU for some time- because of the nature of the book it is dry and while I enjoy history- it is dry- I am not finished with it yet- but determined to finish- I here from another friend there is some illumination or nugget in it so I am going to continue to mine it.
3,Dated material,"This book is interesting enough. It brings up lots of questions I had thought about before. More so, the book invoke interestng question I had never thought about before. It is geared towards an adult adience even though most children will find it interesting.The number of my complaints are limited to two.1. The material is dated. Published in the early 1980's, some information is just plain wrong. Technologial advances some of the answers obsolete.2. There are no photographs but diagrams are scattered thoughout the pages. More illustrations would be beneficial is understanding some of the answers."
4,Great insight,This book contained a good insight into the basics of forensic investigation. It was purchased back in 2007 and I still use it as a reference book to this day.
1,Poor choice in computer forensics,"There simply has to be better than this.The package came without the CD. The text was very limited in useful and relevant material.I used this text for a very good college course in computer forensics. Fortunately, the instructor was incredible. The text was used very little because it was difficult to navigate and not very relevant to the practical approach to computer forensics. Primarily, it was used as a reference guide for file systems and law."
1,Tools and Textbook...too many errors,"This book was used for an intermediate forensics course and it was a terrible combination. I don't know if the authors bothered to validate their procedures with the tools, but neither worked well. We spent almost as much time trying to get the tools to work as we did actually performing investigations. Not only that, but the answers to some of the problems were incorrect. Bad choice of textbook for a college course !"
1,Not Suitable for Small Crickets,"This keeper will only hold fully adult crickets. Small to medium sized crickets escape with ease. The holes in the lid are huge. You might as keep your small crickets in a container without a lid at all - it's that useless.I do like that they sell replacement parts, that's awesome."
4,Overall it is what it is. Great Cricket Keeper,"I received a defective one, Plastic tube cap was cracked. I called Amazon and asked what they could do about it. I received a feasible solution.Becareful with the tops, highly sensitive. I recommend leaving egg cases inside. Also one should tape the holes above where the tubes go in otherwise crickets can escape."
4,"Well, I liked it",This book is a sort of a history or background of the world as Paksennarion knew it. It may be perhaps a bit dry a times as most histories are. But its a good story.
2,DOn't bother...Waste of money,While I have enjoyed most of the books put out by Elizabeth Moon I must say that this one bites the dust without exception. The tale just drags from start to finish without lifting from the drudgery. While the Legacy of Gird is a decent read this one does not have an inkling of enjoyment in it...Better luck next time Mrs. Moon
1,Painful to Read,"This novel was so bad that I threw it away after reading it and was furious that I wasted so much time. It dragged throughout the book entire. The story line just was not interesting,"
1,Very Dull,"While Liar's Oath is the same length as all three books of the Paks trilogy, it took me twice as long to read. Maybe it's because I haven't read The Legacy of Gird, and really didn't know the characters, but this book dragged. The only time I'd recommend reading it is if you're stuck immobile in a hospital bed, and even then it might be hard to get through."
2,Shabby styrofoam with a cover,"I thought it would be smaller, and like burlap or something - but it is just a styrofoam ball with this low-quality fabric covering it. My cat didn't even give it a second look."
4,Excellent sound for the price,I bought this guitar used because I played almost every guitar at the store and this one had as good a tone as much more expensive instruments. I really love the way it sounds and plays.
3,No improvement on built-in mic,"I purchased this along with the Olympus DS-330 digital voice recorder. The Sony microphone does not perform badly, just not any better than the built-in microphone on the Olympus."
1,Sent back,"It didn't pick up the voice sound clear at all. Sounded like i was in left field trying too get a voice Level for recording my singing. For me, not good, but for someone else that justs needs it in a conferance room, maybe it will work fine. Thanks Again."
4,Excellent Mic for the Price,"This is a really good quality mic, especially for the price. The only objection is the on/off switch. It is a major nuisance."
4,Funny!,Funny and the merit of truth. Great book for women looking for confidence in business endeavors.
1,How did this book ever get published?,"The title is eye-catching and the synopsis promised somerealistic suggestions for getting ahead in the land of the glassceiling. What I found, however, was an insipid piece of writing which offers nothing more than an ego boost for the author. Her ""aren't I witty?"" approach is tedious, at best. Unfortunately, books such as this are part of the problem. No woman will be taken seriously if she follows this tripe as the way up the career ladder."
3,Damas...Tanga,"Buen CD de Damas Gratis. Contiene el tema ""Se te ve la Tanga"" que los llevó al éxito. Primer exitazo de Damas Gratis. También contiene el gran tema ""Los Dueños del Pabellón"" y canciones memorables como: ""El Ganador, Yo Ando Ganando y el Fumanchero."" Otro gran trabajo de Damas Gratis. Cumbia villera 100%."
4,F.I. Corvette Engine Model,Well designed. easy to assemble. A few mistakes in the instructions but easy to figure out.
1,Expected more from KONG,"I am very disappointed in this toy because after a matter of hours my Lab started chipping away at the ends. I guess this toy is made for small dogs that don't chew, or to just throw it around and then pick it up so they have no time to just chew on it. This is the second KONG toy that I have been let down by in a day, and I hope the other two toys I ordered will last longer."
3,torn apart after 1 hour,"I have had kong's in the past and never had one tear apart. Within an hour of playing with this toy, my dog managed to tear one of the pieces off and not it can sit flat on the ground."
3,Not for big dogs,Not for big dogs who like to chew. My pit bull had it tore up in about 5 minutes. Our little dog loved it.
2,not as good as other kong product,my golden retriever is only a moderate chewer but she took 30 minutes to chip a piece of the rubber.
2,Don't believe the hype,The Kong Jump'N Jack Dog Toy was cute and bouncybut not as sturdy or durable as described. My puppyhad it all of 5 mins. before biting a piece off.Not for dogs that chew a lot!
2,disappointed,"We gave this to our leagle (lab/beagle mix) and she loved it. It bounces erratically and is fun to chase. The ridges also make it fun to chew. Unfortunately, with in 15 minutes of gnawing, she was able to start removing tiny pieces of rubber. Normally, Kongs (unlike many other toys) prove indestructible to her . . . not this one. Great toy if your dog is not a strong chewer."
2,Not recommended for a lab,Our lab loves the toy - its a lot of fun. But he was able to chew through it in a few hours. I would recommend getting the original Kong instead or the one thats shaped like a bone. They are much harder and better for chewing and our lab loves them as much. He can never have too much of playing with them.
2,Not very tough,"My golden puppy was able to destroy this toy in 10 minutes. The grooves of the Kong made it too easy to rip apart. The black Extreme Kong and red Kong ball have survived my puppy's wrath so far, but the red Kong's don't stand a chance."
2,Not a good as other Kong toys,"We have an Australian Cattle Dog that is a heavy chewer. We love the Kong treat toy (KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red), but were very disappointed with this one. Our dog loved it. She would chew on it, bounce it around, and chase it. However, after only a few minutes of time with it, we noticed small pieces were breaking off at the corners. We chose this particular toy because of the reputation of the Kong brand. This one just didn't seem as good as the other Kong toys we've tried. If you have a dog that chews a lot, I would recommend not getting this product."
2,not for strong chewers,I was really looking forward to getting this and adding treats for my 14 month old lab. He had one knob chewed off within 5 minutes. Never was able to add treats :-(
3,Definitely keeps them busy,"I bought this for my 3yr old pit bull who is a power chewer. I was hoping to find it in the Xtreme version but they don't seem to make it, so I purchased this. While she was really happy and focused on it, as soon as I walked away, I think she had full intentions on destroying it. I went out to throw the trash in the truck (about 4 min) and came back to half a 'jack'. I still fill it with spray cheese and let her chew, but I definitely don't leave her alone. If you purchase for a power chewer, make sure you can keep an eye on them. It's not very durable."
4,A Dental Toy meant to be *filled*,"I think Rosebud missed the point of these toys - you need to put tasty stuff in the deep grooves to encourage your dog to ply the grooves with their teeth. When they do, they'll get a good canine-cleaning!Kong sells ""Stuffin pastes"" that (IMO) have some questionable ingredients. We use bits of cheese, boiled chicken, vienna sausage, or even our dogs' regular kibble (Innova small bites), and always keep at least two of these on hand, one for each dog.Only complaint is that after a few months, the rubber degrades noticeably, and gets all ""gummy"" which causes it to become a magnet for our Sib Husky girl's proliferate shed hair. But several months isn't bad for a dog toy in our house (though $13 surely is not cheap)."
4,Kong Dental Jack Medium,Purchased this for my 10 month old Beagle who loves to chew (anything). Figured it would hold up as well as the origional Kong but found he was able to bite off small pieces of the rubber at the ends. It is not as thick as the origional style. Now I supervise his play with this toy so he does not eat the rubber.
1,Terrible Toy for active dogs,My 11 month only Shih-poo had this toy in pieces within 5 seconds. The toy is VERY soft and she chewed it up after ripping it apart. I would not suggest this toy for the active pup. :-(
1,Dogs thought it was stupid,"Well, this is another toy that sits. Niether of my two dogs have any interest in it - whether it is thrown or rolled. Oh well, had to try..."
1,Fell Apart In Five Minutes,"Within 5 minutes of our unwrapping the toy and giving it to our dog to chew on, the toy started breaking apart into small pieces. I am very disappointed."
3,"Yeah,its ok","Not bad, my dog didn't honestly care for it much. Slots weren't big enough for much food, wasn't really interested in chewing on it. Probably not a bad product, just not ideal for my needs."
5,Dog loves it.,Great toy. My dog loves to play with it. Sometime I put peanut butter in the slits. Easier to keep track of than a ball since it won't roll under the furniture. Very durable. Kong brand is the best.
3,fun but a bit flimsy,"I have always had good luck with Playmobil toys. Unfortunately I feel that this calendar could have used more quality in the making of the calendar. I also find it interesting that this being a Christian Christmas calendar, they substituted the baby Jesus for a santa claus. I wasn't too pleased with that. Therefore, I will be using my baby Jesus from my Playmobil nativity."
3,Great with Liver!,"Great with liver and a nice chianti! Be sure to invite your local census taker over for dinner, too!"
5,i love it,a game for adults and kids..........really simple and its really cool.....the kids love it and when they are in school im guilty of playing myself.....
4,Loved it!,"For the price, this grater works great, I love the fact that it comes with coarse and fine grating blades. I used it to grate the parmesan cheese on my pasta with ease.Great buy!"
5,Terrific value,"When the 15-inch Black Widow speaker blew out of my Peavey KB 300, I chose to replace it with the Eminence KAPPA-15 and I am very impressed with the results. It handles bass, guitar and even drums with ease and clarity. For the money, you can't beat it."
3,Commercial Camel,"Camel, like most progressive bands in the late 1970s, tried to gain a wider audience by going for a more commercial AOR sound. The result is an album with a couple of great tunes (Breathless; Echoes) and a half dozen mediocre ones. Having said that, mediocre Camel tunes were still far better than most of the music on the airwaves at the time (and today!).Established fans will enjoy this album, but if you're new to Camel, try The Snow Goose or Moonmadness first."
2,Point of collapse,"As long as you want radio-friendly pop music without much ambition, ""Breathless"" is a good purchase. But I guess this is the point where Camel began to fade as a progressive outfit. Many songs feature ludicrously overblown titles, shallow lyrics, and lazy singing, an alarming trend that started with ""Highways of the sun"" from ""Raindances"". Although the tracks are quite easy to listen, ""Breathless"" just can't compare with Camel classics like ""Mirage"" and ""Moonmadness""."
5,Very Good,"While I was disappointed to hear that Camel took on a more pop oriented approach with this album from their classic Mirage prog sound, this is still very good. There is still enough prog. instrumentation and fantastic Latimer guitar playing to meet my Camel expectations. The pop sound is sort of like Moody Blues but the instrument playing is better than the MBs could do. Approached with the right expectations, this is an excellent cd."
3,Camel - Breathless,"A verso remasterizada da Esoteric é excelente, tanto na gravao como no encarte. O disco em si no é dos melhores do Camel. Há outras obras da banda muito superiores como ""Harbours Of Tears"", ""The Snow Goose"" e ""Mirage"" e o primeiro disco da banda ""Camel""."
4,More commercial but still worth having,"I think ""Breathless"" is still a solid Camel album. Even if you don't like Sinclair's ""Down on the Farm"", there is plenty of excellent Camel music here. Especially ""Echoes"" is a superb classic Camel track. ""The Sleeper"" has the atmosphere of ""Lunar Sea"". Latimer's solo on ""Summer Lightning"" is excellent. The title track is a beautiful love song. A must have for every Camel fan."
5,The last great Camel album,"On Breathless, you can begin to sense that Bardens and Latimer are going in different directions in their musical vision. But much like the Beatles' ""Abbey Road"" the divergence expands the group. (In this analogy, Richard Sinclair's ""Down on the Farm"" is Ringo's ""Octopuses Garden""). In particular, the songwriting seems to be stronger, albeit less collaborative. The instrumentation for the band was never tighter, and Mel Collins' studio contributions are tremendous.There is less of a cohesive feel than on some previous Camel albums, and a greater concentration on individual songs, but it tends to make each of the songs stand out a little more because of it.Highly recommended"
5,GREAT ALBUM,"I own all Camel albums, it is by far the BEST album this band has. If you are looking to buy something from this band, go for this one or a 2 disc called Echoes!"
5,Romantic!,"This is one of my most favorite rings! I was having problems wearing silver, because of the nickel in it. I bought this stainless steel ring & have no problems! It stays shiny & looks like 'REAL' platinum! I bought one for me & one for my husband...he LOVES his too! Very romantic to be able to read 'I Am My Beloved's...throughout the day :)"
5,Worth a listen,Karen has a great voice and lyrics with meaning. I can't compare here to anyone else because she is unique. Definitely worth a listen.
1,In what universe,"Not my feet I'm afraid, these hit the trash after two days of basically having my toes stuck to roof of my shoes.Pain.. still there in fact more so."
2,"Boringm description, C-list","Approx 97 min long, Director: Tripp Reed, First Look Pictures, prod 2003, rated R, no special features except trailer, stars: Lorenzo Lamas (the ex-soap star, Thralls, The Immortal), Lance Henriksen (Piranha 1, Pumpkinhead, Aliens, Millenium), and a bunch of unknowns.plot Descrip from Amazon.com:Over a quarter of a billion dollars is on a 747 bound for Europe and the plan is to steal it all . . . in mid-air. The perfect team has been assembled and every detail has been examined to pull off the biggest heist in history. A payoff this big, you can't trust anybody.Lamas & his partner botch a heist job for Henriksen's crime boss character. As payback, they agree to join his team of experts in boarding a govt 747 in mid-flight in secret that's transporting $250 milion US. About as dramatic as an episode of Magnum PI."
3,Decent job trying to review all of cancer,"First of all I was dissapointed there were no color illustrations. The book is broken up into first, a few chapters on basic concepts in cancer. Next, chapters which deal with Familial cancers (like bloom's syndrome or Ataxia-telaniectasia, or breast cnacer) and then chapters on cancers by general location(stomach, lung). It is definitely a book for a more professional audience. The chapter's do a decent job reviewing the clinical aspects each cancer type. The molecular biology is at times too in depth and at other times already showing its age. We used some chapters from this book as reviews for a course I was taking in grad. school. Overall I thought it was pretty interesting."
5,As much fun for the author as it was for me,"This was a very fast read. Thoughtful, well written, paints an ethereal landscape using words the way JMWTurner uses oil. Thoroughly enjoyable. Read it over a weekend.As it read it, it occurred to me the author had fun writing this book-however morose and heartbreaking some of the content."
2,Would have made a good short story,"I had high hopes that this would be an exciting read because of the basic premise of a family being chased by bad guys in the wilderness. There were some suspenseful sections, but they were hardly worth reading all the extraneous parts to get to. I think the author tried too hard at creating literature than in writing a good story. Characters could see in the dark because of the ""gloaming"" several times. At least I was forced to use the dictionary and find that gloaming means twilight. The children here were constantly getting their hair ""tousled"". Best (or worst) of all, ""the leaves clattered like a million green voices"". Yuch! Maybe my tastes are too simple, but give me a good Stephen King or Dean Koontz book and I think I'll pass on the ""literary"" novels in the future."
2,Not His Best,"A Triumph of Souls is Alan Dean Foster's 3rd book in the ""Catechist"" Series. And,I hope,the last. The series, starting with ""Carnivores of Light and Darkness,"" has deteriorated to a mechanical and predictable formula by this time: Etolje and his friend get attacked by (insert amazing or unusual phenomenon here). Etolje saves his friends by doing something amazing. His sidekick Simna accuses him of sorcery. Etolje claims no sorcery. The group moves on. If this series had been my introduction to Mr. Foster's works, I would have crossed him off my list of enjoyable authors."
3,Consider this....,"Although Ms. Kellogg is clearly an expert astrologer, I didn't find this book particularly well-written or easy to understand. The book itself is poorly done, with lots of typographical errors which makes understanding it even harder. Perhaps if I were an expert myself, it might be a different case, but as it is, I wouldn't recommend this book to the ""average"" esoteric reader."
5,Incredible!,"I always knew Talk Talk was a great band...on record at least, because I had never heard any live material...and this confirms that they were not only a great band in the studio, but on the stage was well.The highlights are many...you could say each song is a highlight, it's that good...and, upon first view, IT'S YOU and CALL IN THE NIGHT BOY are the two that seemed to hit me that hardest.This is an incredible performance, and if you had even a smidge of interest in this band, this will cement their appeal in no uncertain terms.A great DVD and well worth every cent you pay for it."
4,Talk Talk is one of the most underrated bands.,"The voice of Mark Hollis in this Live concert is just out of this world. It's quite haunting really, it's just that this concert or the audio/video footage and editing really doesn't give his voice and the bands' capacity justice."
1,Poor,"I've been trying to keep this ViewSonic running ever since my son gave it to me as a gift. It rarely maintained a charge, was difficult to sync, and needed constant monitoring when not in the charger. Now I'm trying to find a replacement battery and there's little help. Save your ching."
4,Very good PDA compared to iPaq,"Lots of good information on the Viewsonic, including the software upgrade, at the Yahoo group:http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ViewSonic/"
4,"Thin, Fast and EyeCandy, but no 64mb RAM","I feel that I did get a good price for this pocket pc. The only thing that I am not too happy about is that it doesn't have the 64mb ram they said it would, half is being used by the OS and the other half is whats really available. The quetion that I'd like to ask is what about the 32mb ROM, why couldn't ViewSonic put the OS in ROM. Other than this this Hand Held device is much faster and eye catching then the toshiba e335 that i compared to. The V35's display is really vibrant. Also I've loaded it with tons of PPC software and It hasn't crashed on me yet (knock on wood). I highly Recommend buying a 128mb SD card or higher. But I still feel this is a great PPC.----- Thanks to my wife for getting me this new toy... hahaha-----Love you LUH"
5,"SIZE, WEIGHT AND EASE OF OPERATION AND BEST OF ALL PRICE","After looking and trying several handhelds I found the handheld that was just right. Weight, overall size, ease of operation and best of all the price this unit can not be beat."
2,Piece of Crap,"Granted, I didn't want to spend too much on one of these. I guess I kind of got what I paid for. There is a splotch on the screen that showed up just two months after receiving it. ViewSonic totally ignored me. The battery stinks. The screen freezes so I have to reset the dumb thing. I bought this back in July of 03. I hate it."
1,Beware - Only 36 MB of RAM,"Viewsonic is blatantly falsely advertising the V35 as having 64 MB of RAM. In reality, available RAM is only 36 MB.That presents a real problem for people, like me, who need to use the sole SD slot for an application like Bluetooth...."
2,Memory Lie,The problem I have with my V35 is the incorrect information put out by Viewsonic that the V35 has 64 MB of memory. When you get yours you will see you only have 36.45 MB available for you to use. This product should not be sold as 64 MB.
4,"RAM shortage aside, this is the most bang for the buck!","Summery - If you are looking to enter the Pocket PC world, the ViewSonic V35 is the best low cost entry point.It came down to the iPAQ 1910 and the ViewSonic V35 and I went with the ViewSonic. It had all the features I required and you can't bet the price. You will give up some RAM and a shorten battery life to the competition. But to me these where minor tradeoffs for great performance (larger processor), great screen, small size, light weight and it comes with a cradle (the iPAQ 1910 does not).I had the device for over a week and my only complaint how the device fits into the cradle. It's a little shaky and not as good a fit as my old Palm VIIx. You just have to be extra carefully when docking.There is not doubt in my mind that Pocket PC is the way to go. It is much more friendly than Palm and it has the interface and functionality that you are already familiar with your PC."
2,Don't believe everything that you read!,"I bought this product thinking that it had 64 MB of ram, when really on 36.45MB is accessable... So if you want a product that has this much memory, pick something else! This product was too good to be true! Otherwise, this is an okay product with some good features!"
3,Nice fit but a little thin,"Fast shipping! But the material is a little thin and it has already started pilling. For the price, I am disappointed."
1,Not worth the price.,"As far as leggings go these are just fine, like every other pair I own. What earns them the low rating is lack of value.I paid a third for leggings that own that are just as good. Not happy about that."
5,tapdancer,"These capris are soft and the waistband is perfect. They are a good length, stretch just the right amount and are not too heavy. I don't know if they will stand the test of time (and lots of washing)but they do feel good."
1,A waste of money,"I have 10 cd's with Beethoven's piano sonatas played by John Lill. You can't get worse! The artist does'nt understand the music, there is no feeling at all, the sound of the piano is awfull. I payed 15 guilders (7.50$) for 10 cd's. A waste of money!"
3,Captain So-So,"""Captain Scarlett"" is a rather poor excuse for a swashbuckler. Richard Greene is quite game and makes an engaging hero, as he would in his Robin Hood television series a couple years after. However, the supporting cast ranges from second-rate to truly terrible and the story is pretty slight. Furthermore, as might be expected from an Alpha Video release, the film quality is mediocre on this DVD. I only recommend it if you're a real fan of Richard Greene, otherwise, save your pennies."
5,A must read for scale development,"This is a must read for those laymen who would like to get started with developing their own measurement scales. Where many references in scale development drop a chapter in scale reliability and validity testing, they are far from comprehensive. Here is a monograph that discusses this critical issue in detail. It is written in a easily understood manner, with good balance between theories and applications. The use of factor analytic techniques (exploratory) for testing scale validity though assumes readers a prerequisite understand of this multivariate technique."
4,A very pretty knife,"I really like this knife, it's pretty. But the one I got had a company's logo on it which took away from the clean Swiss design.This knife is great for pruning, and other general tasks and has a sleek look. My only issue is how tight the knife's hinge is but some oil should fix that"
5,supurb!,"This was the best book I have read in years. Extremely practical and personal. I never read a book twice, this one I will."
5,Everything I expected and more!,I received my books in great shape and in a very timely fashion. Would order from this place again...Thanks so much!!
4,A Strong Start....,"I'm Not Giving You Up is quite simply one of Gloria's Greatest Songs Ever...and having been a fan since the early days that is quite a compliment indeed, but this track is just faultless...the album version is outstanding, beautiful (lyrically and musically), thought provoking, haunting...but heard in it's clubbed up version is even better...this is Gloria at her greatest & ALL fans should have these mixes! The CD single itself, however, is a mixed bag...the 1st 3 tracks and the live medley are outstanding and essential to all Gloria Collections...but unfortunately the same can't be said for the Higher mixes...the club versions of this track don't prevent it from being the weakest song from Gloria's Destiny album! However, overall i'd say this CD single is an essential purchase...snap it up while you can!"
1,Not Pleased,did not fit bolt pattern for my truck like the site said it would. Not only that they said it would fit an 09 when the box said 02-06.
5,The best for wind ensambles,"As a member of a high school band, I am very familiar with the music of Holst and Vaughn Williams. They are both excellent composers, and very enjoyable to play. This CD is a wonderful resource, as it combines the works of the two composers. I highly recomend this to anyone interrested in good music, whether familiar with more contemporary clasical or not."
5,British-y,"This is the only recording of these works that I know (I've got about 5) that actually sounds, well, British-y. You know, that British cornet sound in the brass, the darkness of the tone character overall... I think American bands tend to make these works a bit too flashy and bright. This recording has got to be the most authentic-to-what-Holst-intended sounding one that I know. It's the one to get!"
4,Wanna Learn Linux In One Book?..,"I found this book very helpful and was able to find descriptive information to setting up my Linux box. I have many Linux books, but this book tops them all. It's a ""must have"" for those intereseted in RH. No need to waste your money buying extra books, this book has it all!"
2,"Advanced reference, maybe; Beginners beware.","I am new to Linux and I bought this book to compliment my 5.2 server. However, I was deeply dissapointed that there is nothing in the book for beginners. However, I'm sure after I read other beginners books, that it will come in handy. There is information on Apache, networking, and other advanced topics, but as far as commands, beginning instructions, and other topics for the new user, I'd go with something else."
4,"Very comprehensive, but sometimes too much detail is given","It is one of the better books released about RHLinux 5.1, in my opinion it is a great book to learn the do's and don'ts of RHL. However it sometimes gives too much detail on the basics and not enough on system administration or linux for programmers"
2,Great reference... but VERY hard to follow,"I bought this book in hope of a good first book. But, I was really wrong. It is a reference book; you can't read through it. It tells about what is in the configuration files and tells about what each line does. It is a reference on config commands; it has some help on commands, but not much. If you are a new to Linux and want a book to read through get Using Linux by Ball published by Que."
5,Unleashed or perhaps on a Leash,"This book has aided in getting the grip I truly need on RedHat to get it setup and also to maintain it. With sections on nearly every major thing tied with RedHat Linux, this book not only gave me information but also pointed me in the right direction for more information."
1,What a book....,"Although this book holds an extensive table of contents, it doesn't provide much use to those who have a certain level of knowledge, to a new linux user maybe. Most of the stuff in this book ""hides behind the bush"". It talk about a topic but doesn't adequately explain the concept behind. Again just basic user stuff. For a book this thick, I certainly thought it would be really good but it wasn't. A good book fot hose new to Linux but not for those seeking a lot of information."
2,"A reference of sorts, but not a good ""how to"" book","I bought this because the book had the RH 5.2 CD and the liner said the book would help me install it. I was disappointed. A Linux veteran helped me get it installed, and told me the install steps were not all correct. I never got the X stuff to work. Later I could not find simple stuff like how to mount a DOS floppy diskette. I did get started with Linux, but overall I paid too much and would have returned it if I could."
2,Erroneous information and lack of depth in some subjects,"I bought this book, and found in several instances it was incorrect, or just plan lacked any depth.Example 1: Page 107 (3rd edition) talks about windows managers, and talks about CDE. Red hat has dropped CDE. Its not even on the Disk. but the book spends about 10 pages talking about it.Example 2: the discussion of INN is very very lacking. It also, gives steps on setting it up, but doesn't go into how to implement the steps (ooppps). example: ""create a new user news and add the user to the news group...."" (Excuse me, but I bought this book, because I don't KNOW how do do these things).I will be returning the book and buying a different one.Buyer Be ware!,Probably should have looked to WROX professional series for answers...."
2,"no good for beginners, poor reference","This book is disorganized and essentially useless for anything except the command summaries. Even those are incomplete. The Chapters are completely out of order and the focus (especially in networking) is on the GUI tools that RedHat provides, rather than the underlying Linux system they manipulate."
2,Needs to cover setting up and installing more in depth!,"This book I bought to use as a guide to starting my Linux experience. So far it has given me many headaches because the book only lightly skims on most areas (Like setting up the X Windows System) and redirects you to something on the CDROM, while not telling you how to open/browse it. I had to look forward a chapter to find an example on how to open up a text editor...I wish that the book would tell me how I should do something, not just what I should do (""Open up xxx.xxx in your favorite text editor"" I'm a Linux newbie, how am I supposed to know what he's talking about?!).This book is worth the software bundle, though - Red Hat 5.2 is ok, I'm going to buy 6.0 ASAP because 5.2 doesnt support my TNT video card."
5,buy it if you want linux working in 30 minutes,"i'm an absolut nitwit to operating systems but with this book i got it up and running within nearly half an hour, including xwindos, several disks (scsi hd's, jazz) and networking (tcp, samba). the next day the webserver with programs.so, if you want to work with linux and not configuring zillion options, use this book."
3,"Good info, needs better organization","This book has excellent info, but the organization is something that needs a little work. The chapters seem to not flow together and an appendix that lists maybe the tips would be nice. Also the book seems to be based on the X Windows environment. There should be more info on the non-X environment. Not really a beginners book. The index is really nice and well organized and is great for using this book as a reference. Good intro to linux programming too. A few of the links are dead, but when are they not. All in all a good book to have around. I prefer the orielly books as they are more specific to commands, but this book touches on many subjects while the orielly books are more specific. A good compliment to any linux users library."
2,"Very cursory overview, not a good information source","I purchased this book as my first Linux book (I already had some basic Unix knowledge) and I was very unimpressed with the inadequate coverage of many topics. Basic topics were barely touched upon and even complex topics such as web server configuration and daemons were lacking in content and explanation. I strongly recommend using this book as reference only. There are many better books out there (trust me, I had to go buy a few)"
2,Poor documentation on installation,"Got this book thinking it would be a comprehensive guide to installing and using Linux. Using, possibly, but the two slim chapters on installation of Linux was pathetic. Almost no information on drive partitioning -- which caused me hours of problems, lost data, etc. -- and very little about hardware configuration (I have two IDE drives, and the second one is 7.6GB)."
2,confusing and bulky,This book was the worst yet. Nothing I tried worked. I am very unhappy with this book. It has not helped me with linux at all. It gave step by step instructions that had no effect or just did not work. I think the author should have tried some of the steps on linux 5.2 and found out for themselves that it does not work.
5,Excellent resource for newbies to advanced Linux users.,"This book is one of the very few Linux books I look through on a daily basis, to understand concepts and configuration syntax.The books covers everything from the actual installation of the product, to configuring peripherals, in an extremely organized manner.This is a MUST have book for anyone who is a newbie to an advanced user of Red Hat Linux 5.2.***** (5 Stars)"
2,"Definitely not for ""newbies""","I like the chapters covering programming languages such as python, perl and Tcl/tck. However it was frustrating and very difficult to follow; it assumes a lot of knowledge on the user's part and jumps around on specific instructions--to tell you the truth the book was a waste of money. Red Hat really needs to tailor their documentation to the ""complete idiot"" (oh well, I guess I qualify)."
3,Fair overview,This book is a fair overview but doesn't go in near enough detail for any given topic. I can only imagine this as a book for folks with some unix experience but not enough knowlege of whats out there for RHL. You'll need some more detailed books for doing real work.
2,Not impressed.,"I've been working with computers most of my life and am an MCSE. I wanted to learn Linux so I bought this book. This is the most poorly organised operating systems book I've ever read. He tells you to install this program and run that file but doesn't give a command-line for how to do it. An example from page 48: ""Mount your Red Hat CD-ROM and navigate to the RedHat/RPMS/i386 directory"". No word on how to ""navigate"". At least he could have mentioned the CD command *somewhere* in there. The actual commands are buried in the Appendix. This is definately *not* for someone new to Linux."
2,Confusing,"I think it's a very confusing book for a beginner like me, but yet doesn't go into much detail for an advanced user, like I want to be. It you don't know how to install ethernet card, this book is no help. It often goes something like ""If bla bla has any aliases, enter them in the aliases box"". Thanks, I could have figured that myself if I only knew what these aliases were. If I were like you, and didn't have this book yet, I wouldn't buy it."
3,Too little info for the average system administrator....,"Unfortunately I didn't find enough info in this book to configure a LINUX machine with all services you would find on an NT or Novell server. Maybe the LINUX Network Toolkit is a better choice. Please mail me if you agree to this, so I can order it without hesitation."
1,How to catch bottomfish,"TERRIBLE Vendor, the rating should be NO stars. Book was not the same name as ordered. Instead of Charlie Whites 103 Fishing Secrets, I received How to Catch Bottomfish by Charlie White. The book was listed as ""like new"". but actually was so old that the pages are completed yellowed and the book has been used so often that some of the pages are worn. This was total dissappointment of which I may discontinue purchasing any used books from Amazon because of poor quality control when they publish a used book rating of its condition."
4,Vee's for Victory,Very detailed and fine book. Lots of technical information. It is not for casual reading.It is one of the best books I have read and studied in a long time.
4,Exceptionnaly good account for an important aero engine,"It is a pity few such accounts found their way to the readers! Well, readers for such books are not too many, anyway.The book tells the story of the enterprise which created the engine. The design and development are described with a good balance between text readability and technical details. The list of aircraft which used the engine is provided with brief description of every type (this chapter in particular can be a bit more ""technical"", in my opinion, using more performance test data and installation details). Description of every (?!) variant of the engine, which made it at least to the testing stage is included. Appendices contain useful reference material too.I wish there will be similar books devoted to many other aero engines! The book is highly recommended. Not five stars but a strong four."
4,cutting-edge thriller,"Glahn and Cutrer have created a thrilling, moving, and frighteningly believable world in 'Lethal Harvest.' Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The authors aren't afraid of controversial topics -- this book will make you think, and will force you to take another look at how genetic research is being conducted today. If you liked the sci-fi movie 'Gattaca' you will love this book. I strongly recommend it."
5,Best Out There!,"I am very picky when it comes to Christian fiction. That being said, I was totally riveted by these novels. They are some of the best of the best out there! Not only were the facts, details, and plot excellent, these people know how to write romance in perfectly amidst the thriller genre! I'd recommend these for anyone who likes thrillers with a bit of romance. This is not cheesy romantic Christian fiction."
1,Give it a Pass,I thought that this book was going to be an interesting story involving genetic engineering. I was very disappointed - the religious aspect of the story was VERY hard to swallow.
5,Great RB product,"For me this was really helpful and after reading I understand a lot more of metafors and utilization of language in very specific ways to guide client in a more useful direction.It has transcripts from when he worked with diferent clients diferent problems and gives the ""tricks"" - important things to notice that make all the diference. Sometimes explains in detail so anybody can understand and at the end of the book has a transcript (of someone who wants to stop eating so much) broken down in small pieces in the left and in right he tells what are the presup., nominalizations, conjunc etc.In the apendix you'll find the milton model.As any other RB product you have to read it again and again and again.... cause you'll always find more and of course go do it with people !Sebastian StefanRomania"
1,not worth the money,I do not like this touch up roller. It scrapes on the carpet and does a lousy job of picking up the link etc that shows up on the carpet. I would not recommend.
5,Review of the brain,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to Joe Diffie's ""This is your brain"". It tells of a man who has convinced himself that he can resist being lured to the attractions of a beautiful woman. But when he sees this one, all bets are off! All of a sudden he's human and he show's the signs of love at first sight. His ""heart starts overloading,"" and he's ""crazy over everything she does."" And the line ""You ain't insane, this is your brain on Love"" defines the emotions of the song perfectly. I certainly recommend this to anyone who has ever felt that way!"
4,Not very soft !!,"Cute sheet set, I ordered this set for my little girl. She loves them but after I washed them I was dissapointed with the softness of the fabric, they are not harsh but definatly not as soft as I expected them to be at a 200 thread count. I have gotten 200 thread count sheets from Pottery Barn Kids and they are much much softer than these were !! Overall a little disappointed but they look great in her room."
5,Nice sheet set,"I just got the Santa Rosa sheet set. It's the standard quality of Hilfiger, nice pink color but if color is important to you the seahorses are green and not blue as shown in the picture. I bought 2 sets for my daughters and they love them!"
3,Too flimsy.,"This holder looked nice on the package, but since the napkins just sit on top of the platform and the arm and weight are so flimsy, I find myself pulling the whole stack out trying to get just one. And it isn't that easy to move from place to place without having to use two hands. Think I'll put this one aside and keep looking."
5,Style Meets Function,"Easily delivers one napkin at a time, without having to ""snatch and pull"". Hip and stylish accent piece for any table or dining area."
4,Part of the History,"These notes surprisingly took for me the glory out of one of the second generation Work teachers.I had formed an opinion that Jane Heap with her time with Gurdjieff, her association with the Rope (lesbian group in Paris in the fourties with Gurdjieff) and later taking over Stanley Nott's group in England, must have taught the work in a very authentic way.Authentic - yes, if authentic means repeating 'little by little' and other fairly meaningless idioms often used by the groupleaders in the Gurdjieff Work. And yes, if leaving verbs out of sentences is considered 'Gurdjieff's new language'.The book is made from the notes of Jane Heap and that does explain the lack of verbs in sentences (but not the use of 'little by little's'), which makes it difficult to read.However, occasionally some of the 'greatness' of Jane Heap comes through and makes it worth a closer study - which is also necessary as the book does not open easily."
3,A Lot Of Information On Many Spiritual Topics,"This three hour long DVD is a bit different than what I expected. What it is, is a talk show series with many interesting guests and topics covered. I couldn't watch it all in one sitting, but watched one show per day. Aside from the fact that I didn't have three hours to carve out of my day, I wanted to watch an episode, digest the information I heard and think about it for awhile, perhaps form my own opinions and do some online research into the subject, then move on to the next.Sure, not every guest's topic will tickle your fancy, but there's definitely something for everyone. Whether you want to hear about Daniel Pinchbeck and his encounters with a tribe in Gabon, Africa and the experience with iboga (a psychedelic drug), or Mayan prophecies, universal archetypes, or beginning meditations, there's a lot of information to take in. Fascinating!"
4,Spiritual Talk Show,"As a Philip Gardiner fan, I was excited to see him participate in this self-proclaimed ""Spiritual Talk Show"". It is exactly as described and very interesting. Only gave it a four because production was simple. If unity and harmony are on your mind, give this DVD a chance."
3,Low-tech Talk on Spirituality,"Bridging Heaven and Earth is a talk show dealing with spirituality in what some people might consider a ""new age"" genre. It is hosted by ""Allan""--no last name--and I was a little put off initially by the cheesy set and overall visual quality, but the guests and discussion are really absorbing once it gets going."
4,Interesting DVD,"Very interesting DVD. Talks about 2012. I would have given it 5 stars, but the picture quality is NOT that clear. They need to re-edit the picture quality of this DVD & reduce the price to $10.00 - $15.00 because of the quality of the video. FORGOT TO MENTION, I LOVE THE MUSIC FROM TWINFLAME ""PEACEFUL WARRIOR"" ON THIS DVD."
5,"Much Better Than ""Private Benjamin""!!","This little known female army recruit movie is a must for "" Private Benjamin"" fans.It's very well worth a look,so check it out!!"
5,Deep House Happiness,"Pink is a fantastic Music Happiness for your soul, if you want a new music inspiration, This album is a hot shot for you....Take it to your favorite vacation place and share the happiness of Divine sound!!From NorwayCarlos ToledoBy Madeinheaven"
5,Good House Music,"This ""CD' is so good! If you like Naked music, miguel migs, Benn Watt etc then you will enjoy this cd. I highly recommend it."
4,good gloves,"These gloves are great to use when cooking or cleaning. I ordered the wrong size, however they still serve the purpose."
4,What A Classic.,"This Is Such A Good Book In Everyway. I Cried Many Times While Reading It,Yes Its Rather Sad! The Only Problem With This Book Is That If Your Not Familer With ""Horse Terms"" Like I Am, Then You Might Not Always Get What Thier Talking About. However Its Still A Great Book."
2,Atlas of the Lunar Terminator - A disappointment,"A great concept, good text, but the photo reproductions are of very poor quality. If Cambridge University Press were to re-issue this book with good, sharp copies of Professor Westfall's photos, then this would be a five plus star book! At the present Rükl's ""Atlas of the Moon"" or Cherrington's ""Exploring the Moon"" better fill the needs of the Selenic observer."
3,Useful but paradigm overdone,"This is a thin, fast-paced book covering the essentials of writing screenplays. Field covers his paradigm for screenplays: setup-plot point-confrontation-plot point-resolution. In fact, he does it over and over again, until you desperately want to find an exception to the rule just to prove him wrong. (My Dinner With Andre, perhaps?) Well, he does make some good points, but he also interprets the paradigm so flexibly that it's hard to contradict it.He also goes into character and scene-setting and provides a number of examples, from the beginning of Chinatown to the first love scene in Silver Streak (a personal favorite, so I approved).Beyond that, he also goes into the mechanical details of how to preserve your copyright and how to get the screenplay out.All in all, a seemingly useful book."
2,Overrated,"The idea of Syd Fields book is very tempting: One formula for everything; once you know it, writing is bliss. Alas it is not true. Creativity still means being creative. After I read this book I asked myself: 1) If Mr. Fields knows so much about scriptwriting how come I never heard of scripts written by him? 2) Did he really read the script of CHINATOWN? Don't get me wrong: I agree CHINATOWN is a great movie, but the *script* ... okay, it is obviously well crafted, but by no means overtowering everything else. Despite all this it is helpful to read the book. Because producers and other ""important"" people browse books like this and believe in the magic of ""plot point"", paradigm et. al. It helps when you at least have an idea what they talking about."
4,"""Screenplay""",This book is known as the Bible of screenwriting and it is a necessary read for all aspiring screenwriters.
1,"Why is he an ""expert""?","Why this man is renown as a Guru of screenwriting is beyond me.No wonder most films these days are all about special effects and have no substance.This is a manual for assembly line cinema. Read ""Beyond the Screenplay"" by Zachariah Rush instead."
1,Examples Don't Work,"As a thirty-year (successful) script writer and scriptwriting prof, I always check the new books. This one was disappointing. It simply does not address basic script structure to the degree people need.Mr. Field also uses far too many examples in his book. When examples are used, students tend to ""lean"" on them, and eventually (consciously or not) imitate them.Once a person understands the basics of proper script structure (not lay-out, which is entirely different), he or she can then write something completely original . . . and saleable.Try Louis Catron. I started with him, and recommend him to all my students, even though I've written my own books. Catron is simply the best."
3,overall a good book,This book helps you get started and gives you an idea of what needs to be done. It should be followed step by step. Most good screenplays do not follow some rigid plan. Use it to understand the basics and get to writing!
1,waste of time and money,"This will only leave you dazed and confused. Writing by the numbers is the worst way to write anything. I'd like to see a screnplay that this guy has written (if he is even capable of it) before I take his advice. Do you see what I'm getting here? He can't write a screenplay, but he can give others advice on how to do it. Huh? Run that by me again. Actually, it's not that difficult to figure out: since he can't write a screenplay he has, however, devised a way to make money writing these how-to books--and lots of it. Fine, for him--but not so good for you, because this is advice coming from someone without credentials. If Sam Fuller or John Huston were giving advice on screenwriting (or, say , Akira Kurosawa,) that would be well and good. But no, it's this guy who hasn't got the talent to do it."
4,"one of a few 'bibles' of screenwriting, Field knows his stuff","This text is more 'how to' then McKee's Story, though both are excellent. The technological information on writing with programs accurately states that such programming should not take the place of creative thought.The programs have come a long way since then, but has the craft of screenwriting? Did this year's summer blockbuster onslaught show growth of Hollywood? Or is Hollywood a perpetual adolescent? Field's work has stood the test of time, and his techniques are clear and simple. I am still working on my first few scripts, and have benefited immensely from this recommendation by an accomplished writer. How lucky to be one of his students, I guess this is close!"
5,Demystifies the writing process,This book is a must read for a new screenwriter and is very useful for those who just want to understand storytelling better.
1,...,"Quite simply, the book that ruined Hollywood movies. If you want to know how NOT to do it, then read this guide and file it under useless. Read Aristotle's Poetics instead. He got it right. Field, who doesn't have a single film credit to his name, does not."
2,"You'll swear because of it, not by it","There's at least one screenwriting agency listed in Writer's Digest's WRITER'S MARKET that won't even open anything you mail them unless you've read everything Syd Field has written on the craft. I fail to understand why, since it appears that Syd is to screenwriting what Freud is to modern psychiatry: someone only referred to on an academic level, not a practial one. I used this book to help me write my first screenplay, which was rejected by a screenwriting contest and later a major agency. It spends too much time glorifiying the Jack Nicholson film CHINATOWN than providing any practical information on such important things as formatting or maximum number of pages or even what font to use. It's also quite dated, since it mentions that you can register a script with the Writer's Guild for as much as $3."
3,Guide to the Hollywood Factory,"Fields excels in bringing us the basics of structure and form. While this book is mostly geared to the Hollywood ""cut-and-paste"" style of screenwriting (hand in hand with all those PC script programs), there are valuable lessons to be learned for screenwriters from other countries."
5,THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT,"Screenplay is excellent, scholarly yet very readable. And although it's obvious that the primary target audience is the serious film student, it's also an enjoyable and educative read for the serious (and pseudo-serious) film buff. Great read! I look forward to reading other books by Syd Field."
2,Don't be fooled...,"Yes, this book can be helpful for the basics such as: sluglines, scene descriptions, action, dialogue etc.... BUT, do you really want to take lessons from a guy who's never had a career in writing screenwriting? If you want my advice... learn the basics, read as many GOOD screenplays as you can (not crap like Twilight) and be original. Do things that haven't been done before. Hollywood is looking for originality and new material."
4,Worthwhile for Novelists Too,"I'll preface by saying I'm a novelist, not a screenwriter. But I enjoyed and gleaned from this book on so many levels, not least in quenching my curiosity about some of the behind-the-scenes crafting of movies. Strictly from a novelist's point of view, however, I found the book worthwhile for two primary reasons. 1) Its stripped-down, simple view of structure is fabulous. It allows you to see the basics of structure at a glance, break it down to manageable chunks, and realize the big picture. 2) It's also valuable in its ability to help film-saturated authors (such as myself) realize the important differences in story on the screen and story on the page. Worth reading whether you're a screenwriter, a novelist, or a short story writer. Or even just a film buff."
3,A good complement to other screenwriting books,"Before a house can be built, you need to create the blueprint and lay the foundation. Such is the same with writing a screenplay, and this book teaches you how to do just that. What I took away is one perspective on the creative thought process as it applies to movie structure.The author teaches how a screenplay is structured (3-Acts) and the purpose of each act. He then further breaks the acts down to their own internal structure and the elements that comprise them individually and as a whole. Essentially, he teaches how to create the framework of a film that will be filled in later with narrative, characterization, and dialogue.My conclusion about the book is that it's useful and worth the purchase price, but know that it's not the definitive treatise on screenwriting."
5,The best booka aboiut screenwriting ever,I have read this book several times and every time I learn something new. It's definetly THE book of screenwrtiting. Syd Field has the wonderful talent to write about very complex things in a way that feeds your imagination and gives you hope. Only a real master can do that.
3,It will help you with structure,"This book will definitely help you with structuring your screenplay. However, he's a little too much in awe of the Chinatown script. Seems like every couple of pages he references it. Hey, it's a good script but stop worshipping Robert Towne already.If you want to write screenplays, I suggest you read this book very carefully, then forget about it. What you need to retain you will have retained. To use this book as a guide to writing a script the way you would use a recipe in a cookbook to make a meal is limiting yourself and the world of movies."
2,Zzzzz...,"This exactly the kind of book I would expect to get highly praising reviews. It has all the elements of popular modern literary fiction: a hackneyed, archetypal plot; a melodramatic but overblown love story (what a surprise, the girl has been hurt before); the obligatory loss of love and gaining of redemption; the prose style masquerading as 'elegant' because it is told in a half-hearted stream-of-conscious style, which the author believes gives license to present a story in a fragmented, verbose manner that attempts to conceal glaring weaknesses in plot.This book is average at best; if you're reading for the WW2 stuff look for Halpert's A Real Good War and if it's for the love story there's really nothing to distinguish this from the thousands of other patently mass-produced love stories cluttering bookstore shelves. Also please do not insult a marvelous writer such as Ondaatje with comparisons to this sentimental drivel."
3,Not as good of quality as expected,I thought this mask actually went over the top of your head and covered the back of your head as well as front. It is a front only mask. The elastic is very thin and broke the first time I wore it.
5,Hours of Fun!,"I bought these for my toddler, who is very into learning his ABCs right now, and he loves them. It's all he wants to play with!"
4,Royal Navy Historical Fiction,"Exceptionally revealing in its technical detail. It may be a bit dry for the average reader, but if you ever wanted to know how sailing warships really worked and got the job done, especially the smaller craft, this is an outstanding book to read. Drinkwater is a captivating character because of his devotion to his duty and his people, both professional and familial, while accepting his role as a supporting player taking his share and more of hard knocks on the slow climb up the promotion ladder. Drinkwater's love of his profession is infectious, and Woodman conveys this to the reader expertly as his character's mood rises and falls as events unfold."
2,The head fell off.,"I'm an amateur hobby photographer with a digital Canon Rebel. I like to do outdoor photography, so I carry the camera attached to the tripod as I hike or just walk around. I liked all the features of this tripod. It was smooth and easy to use. HOWEVER, when I carried it parallel to the ground, the plastic head fell off the shaft with my camera on it. I now have an expensive camera repair. The tripod was supposed to be able to suport 9 lbs. My camera and lens were less than 3 lbs. If you're going to be staying indoors or in one place when you use this tripod, it might be a perfect product. But if you want to move around or hike and will be carrying it at an angle other than straight up, I'd steer clear of this tripod. I wanted to spend less than $100 on a tripod, but now I'll have at least $100 repair, and I'm without a tripod."
1,Imitation Product,"I purchaseed a bottle of Estee Youth Dew from Beauty Encunter (unopened box) only to receive an imitation product. I compared the label with a label of an original bottle of Estee Lauder Youth Dew I have at home and the Beauty Encounter product was an imitation. Fortunately, Beauty Encounter reviewed my response, removed my negative response and has sent me this message:""We are sorry to hear that the perfume you received in your last order was not up to your expectation. We pride ourselves in offering only high-quality products, but apparantely this item was not carefully inspected by our warehouse. Please see the attached link for your prepaid return lable. Once we recieve the bottle back we will issue you a full refund. ""I will mail the product back on July 27, 2010 and see if I receive a full refund including shipping & handling vs. all of the 15% Shipping and Handling and restocking fees that normally apply. I am willing to give Beauty Encounter another chance."
1,Good fo about six months,and then the handle broke off. it's a challenge to find a sturdy grater since Parmesan cheese is hard. The oxo model I had before suffered the same fate after a while. I don't think good graters like the ones I have seen in restaurants come cheap.
1,Cheese grater doesn't make the grade,"I bought this product knowing it cost a little more than other hand graters which are similar. I thought it would be the higher quality product. I was wrong. Generally it's true that ""you get what you pay for"". But this grater is absolute garbage. You can tell just by the way it feels when you're using it. Ours shaved little shards of metal into the cheese as it was turning! If I hadn't noticed, my family would've eaten it. So I warrantied it. On the replacement one the handle broke on the first try. I just got my money back after that and bought a Zyliss."
1,Lousy Grater,"This is a terrible machine. There are gaps that large pieces of cheese falls through while you're grating. It makes a terrible grinding noise when your using it, like metal touching metal. Also it is difficult to turn. If I hadn't thrown the box away...d'Oh, I would return it instantly...so I'll return it to the garbage can instead..might as well have lit $25.00 on fire!....keep looking!"
3,cheese grater,"This grater appears to be made well. It is sturdy and works easily. it could be easier to hold, the handle design is somewhat uncomfortable, but overall a good product at about the average price for a stainless steel cheese grater. My only real complaint is that even the company that makes it does not offer the other grating wheels listed as sold separately."
2,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed after using this grater for the first time. It was very uncomfortable in my hands, hard to hold, had cheese (hard parm) coming out both sides and going all over the place; was difficult to deal with left-handed and just plain not worth it. I was looking forward to having a S/S grater, but not this one. Will put it in a yard sale and try for another one after I check it out in a store. Having a reverse grater is very important to me. I had a plastic one that worked great for years, but it finally broke. :( This one just isn't it. Sorry."
1,Beware!,"The sharp edges on the basket, handle and drum on this device makes this the least ergonomic piece of kitchen equipment I have. It requires a ridiculous amount of force to grate a hard cheese, leading to hand fatigue, and inevitably, injury (I almost always end up grating my hand). This is going straight into the trash!"
4,Solid,"I purchased this grater to replace a plastic grinder that had a similar design. The plastic one didn't work as well,felt flimsy, and would actually grind small grains of plastic in with the cheese. This grater is very well built and grinds well. The metal construction gives it a solid feel that should last many years. I took off 1 star because the vender didn't inclued any information about replacemeny parts. I would like to add second grinding tube for a less coarse grind option but there isn't any information as to whether that would be available."
2,Not worthed,"Well, It is heavy duty but I work in a restaurant and I tell you, nobody of the servers like it , it is hard to use it and he does not a good job grating cheese. I would not recommend it"
4,A solid performer,"I received this grater as a gift at least a year ago after the plastic handle on the grater I previously owned, which came from a high-end kitchen store, snapped off. I have not had any trouble with this grater and am surprised by the negative comments it has received. My drum has held up, the handle is solid, and it grates cheese quickly and efficiently. My only complaint is that on a few occassions I have pinched my finger on the clasp that closes the basket. (It is very tight.)Keep in mind, however, that this is a small grater with small holes. It is for shredding cheese over your pasta or chocolate or nutmeg over your dessert. I do not recommend this grater for shredding large quantities of cheese or for soft cheeses; the basket is not very big and pressure on the top arm would simply mush soft cheeses through the small holes. If you need to grate a lot of cheese or soft cheese, a food processor is a better choice."
1,"Keep lying, something will remain...","A well known propaganda technique is to lie constantly and create impressions. Almost always in the end something remains. A good example of this, is the myth about homosexuality in ancient Greece.That myth was mainly created with mistranslations, misquotes and ignored sources. Dover's book is considered a classic on the subject and there are quite a lot of people who believe in the myth because of it. So for those who read the book and thought it was informative, had mounds of evidence etc. as some reviewers say, you should get your hands on this:Homosexuality in ancient Greece: The myth is collapsing by Adonis Georgiades."
3,"Nice, but not new","I think it's a great book but if you are already familiar with law of attraction stuffs and self-help junkie like me, there is nothing new here.Although the way the information is presented is pretty nice. I would recommend it to people who are new to law of attraction and self-help."
5,Peel Away the Layers,"Exactly what The Passion Test does! As opposed to many other ""goal setting"" books, this test encourages you to leave your brain and ego behind and open up to your ""true"" gut and heartfelt passions. It's a new and exciting technique to get to the ""center"" of all those hidden layers. This book will guide you toward fulfilling your purpose and passion! I read it and am now living it! It's NOT magic or hype...it does require an open mind and heart, but to me it's worth it! I'm making it and the book Understanding: Train of Thought required reading for all of my students."
3,the power of passion,I like the way this book explores the role that emotions play in our lives-I would recommend it along with FREE YOUR MIND by Anthony Stultz and CHANGE FOR GOOD by Cheri Huber.
5,The best help I have had,"I started personal development about 3 years ago. I continued to look for something that would help me find my (WHY) what do I want where do I want to go and how do I do this? I wondered if anyone had something a new or simple person could understand. I was introduced to the Passion Test by a friend and It has been the best, step by step how to put your goals in place and brings out what you are most passionate about. I recomend this book to everyone who is looking to pull out that most inner goal."
1,Nothing new......,It's easy to know one's passions the most difficult is to make them coherent between them (some are very opposite) and to use them in a way that we can make money and live well with them.This book dont explain that.The book can be resume in a sentence : put your top 10 passions and order them from the most important to the less. So don't waste your money whith it.
1,Poor Poor Poor,This book receives the award for staying in my possession the shortest time ever. It ended in the rubbish two hours after I received it.This is Janet's story of how to rip you and thousands of others off. Add to that story minutia and pabulum.Save your money and read the one star reviews. They are all true. The five star reviews are either from morons or the friends of the authors.
3,"Great material, but save your money","I really enjoyed the first half of the book because it is direct and clear. List 10 passions, find out your top 5 passions and look at them on a daily basis. I had an epiphany when I found out my number 1 passion!Then, for the rest of the book, there is nothing new and it seems like a rehash from other self-improvement books. I was less excited and have stopped reading the book.This book is recommended for those who don't know their passions in life or need to re-organise their passions to achieve their maximum potential!"
1,Could not get passionate about The Passion Test,"If you want focused, easy to apply guidelines on finding & developing your own passions this book is a waste of your time and money. If you don't mind having your focus constantly interrupted by the boring details of the author's ego trip to India, then you might enjoy it. It totally failed to gain & keep my interest long enough to dig out anything of practical value. The ""effortless path"" in this book leads to boredom, confusion, and disappointment. It never got anywhere close to helping me discover my life purpose. I regret buying the book."
1,Save your time and money...just another iteration of the same stuff,"If you've been around the personal development arena for even a short while you've heard this all before... this book is just another spin on the same content... I became extremely bored and dis-engaged in listening to yet another ""guru"" tell their story about personal growth.I think the book is good for those who have never been exposed to this type of information before...but if you have been to seminars, read many of the contemporary personal development books, watched the Secret and on and on with the same stuff...I appreciate the authors words and truly and genuinely feel great for their success... but save your money if you've been around the block at least once."
4,Good Book With Practical Advice,"When I first read this book I wanted to become a Passion Test teacher!! It's the essence of changing your life, if you are not happy,then you need to figure out what's important to you. I used their on-line version of the test, it was much easier to use. I was amazed at how long I had chewed on my own situation and that when I started making lists, I got clear on what I wanted. When you know what you want, its yours. I absolutely believe that there is magic in intention and focus, and some very dificult areas in my life have resolved already!"
5,The Bottom Line is:,"The bottom line is: this book makes you think. Many people do not know where to start in remaking/enriching their lives. Is the process in this book simple? Absolutely! It is also fun to read, engaging, and informative. It gives you some simple yet profound concrete steps that anyone can do to begin to make their life more of what they want. This book is for everyone, even if you already think you are living the life of your dreams!"
3,The Passion Test,"When you read other authors, you find it repetitive.... if you are a first time reader of self-improvement books you will find it kinda of a bilble...."
1,Not worth the money,"If the book was being sold for $1.00, I would say buy it. But, not for the price it is being sold for. You'll keep turning pages to get to the ""test,"" don't bother you already did."
5,Discover your true desire,"The Passion Test: The Effortless Path to Discovering Your DestinyAfter setting goals for many years, and achieving some of them, I discovered this book which is a step-by-step process of discovering your PASSION. If you are not working toward your true passion, you will be stressed, resentful and unhappy. But most of us do not know our true passion, nor how to discover it, and therefore cannot or do not work toward it. Everyone should be required to read this book, study it and do its exercises - they will be more fulfilled if they do."
2,The Passion Test,"Just getting started with the book - initially very difficult to get past the 'GOD' references. Personally, I think there should be some kind of tag on the cover of books to indicate that it is a Chrisitan work, that would no doubt save many a few bucks and avoid purchasing books that are mostly old worn-out Christian reference manuals. I am disappointed that many of the 'endorsers' of this book also hold a Christian view. If you can't explain 'that which all things are created through', it would be a good idea not to waste our time writing a book. The group consciousness is at that stage now, we are no longer intrigued or interested in the old worn-out ""GOD"" explanation.I must say that the content of the book - less the Christian references, justification, and explanations - seems intelligently written, and since I don't know how to get a refund from Amazon (which I would prefer at this point), I will continue with the book and provide a comphrensive review upon completion."
1,"""Free Gifts""","This book comes with a fortune of free gifts, or so the marketing goes. Strange that a lot of these gifts are tied to many of the reviewers giving this book 5 stars . ."
2,I wanted to believe,I received this as a recommendation from T. Harv Eker so I naturally was excited to read the book. I really wanted to believe but at the end I felt that it didn't really teach me anything. God bless this woman for her treks to India and wherever.. but it didn't really help to answer any deep questions for me.If you are drawn to this book I believe there are certainly better options to help you find your path. Although this may speak differently to certain people.
1,"Waste of paper, waste of money","This was recommended to me by a friend. I'm a person who is interested in so many things that I still can't seem to narrow down what I want to be when I grow up. I was hoping this book would help me.Nope.Wanna know what the passion test is? I won't even charge you for it! Write down 10 things you're passionate about, then pick the one you're most passionate about. That's it. That's the whole ""test.""The rest of the book is a bunch of stories about the ""Saints"" of India and how the authors' friends made their bazillions of dollars pursuing their passion...to be bazillionaires. Oh, and references to The Secret. Can't have a self-help book without those!"
5,Buy this book,If you are looking for a book that can help you redefine your passions and realign you towards success purchase this book. I highly recommend it.
5,Chris and Janet Attwood made a huge difference in my life!,"When I did the work on discovering your passion with Chris and Janet in a workshop, I wasn't expecting that much to happen because I am already living my passion -- teaching others about how to become more successful. However, their powerful process took me to an even deeper place, where I realized I was not spending enough time with my true number one passion -- my family! That realization, and the other work they did with me, has changed the way I have lived the past year.This book contains what you need to know to create the same breakthroughs for yourself. I highly recommend it.Jack CanfieldCo-author of the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" seriesCo-author of ""The Power of Focus"" and ""The Success Principles"""
5,Amazing!,It's a simple but astounding book! I believe everyone should take the Passion Test so we would all know what we're meant to do in this life.
2,"Makes some since, but...","This book could help someone really dedicated to self improvement, makes since, but I really can't imagine anyone spending the time or that dedicated to improving this way."
5,Disolves limitations,I have taken the test and the results have proven to be by far the most valuable information that I have given myself to date. The results are uplifting and I found myself in a 'new life style' that I often thought of as unattainable. I recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a positive existence.
5,Excellence,"Product in perfect NEW condition, as promised. Prompt delivery. Will definitely do business again. Thanks!"
5,A MUST READ!,The Passion Test is a GREAT book to help you clarify what is most important to you. If you follow the book and take the test often it helps keep you focused. You will never be successful if you don't know what you are passionate about and keep that passion fresh in your mind.
4,Good starting point,"Yes, this is what others have said but I do agree...For $10 it is a great starting point. It made me focus all those thoughts that were bouncing around in my head and then helped me find a #1 passion. The first half is the preamble to the tests, the second half is just a bunch of inspirational anecdotes to reinforce their point. Not my style so I didn't think they were necessary. I do recommend this book - I believe it is a good value."
3,Don't expect too much,"I read ""The Passion Test"" before I published my own memoir ""Driving Straight on Crooked Lines: How an Irishman found his heart and nearly lost his mind"" Given the title of my own book and my occupation as a management consultant and executive coach, I guess my interest in the topic of ""finding one's passion"" should be obvious. The book didn't do a lot for me - it seemed somewhat ""gimmicky"" and superficial in its approach to a major, if unarticulated, quest in most of our lives. I wouldn't depend on it to help me truly get in touch with my passions in life. That said, my professional experience suggests that different people get in touch with their life's purpose in different ways. No doubt very many people will find it useful. I found it hard to read, in the sense that I couldn't ""get in to it."" For someone who has no clue as to what their passion in life is all about or who wants to acquire a vocabulary about the subject this book might be a good starting point."
2,I have heard it before,"It was helpful in making my passions more clear but a lot of what is said in this book has been said many times in other books. If this was the first book in its gendre that I read, it would have been great."
1,"All hype, no substance","I should have read the other negative reviews before buying this book. The Passion Test is nothing more than making a list of 10 things you like and then whittling it down. No insight, no creativity, no help.One thing is clear: The author's passion is marketing pap to the pseudo-spiritual seekers. Save your money."
3,Just OK,"I wasn't blown away by this book. If you're trying to figure out what your passions are, this book is only helpful if you are already clear about what interests or motivates you. If you're like me, and still trying to figure out what makes you tick, I don't think this book will be of much assistance. However, for people who already have honed in on their interests, I can see how this book would be very helpful in focusing those interests into passions to concentrate on."
1,"Basically, too basic","I bought this book at a time in my life that I most definitely needed inspiration, a spark that would help me discover my calling, my ""passion"" in life. What a disappointment this book turned out to be. There was nothing new, no groundbreaking discoveries, no fresh slant on existing material.Actually, it does provide some incentive: to write my own self-development book. If I had sat down and written the title first - The Passion Test - I reckon I could've scraped together enough ideas and packaged them sufficiently well to rival this publication. Hang on........I don't think I could've achieved the latter as I am definitely not as well connected as these authors. In this age of joint ventures, I dare say these guys have created relationships with many notable authors and therefore, there book and promotional material is covered by many complimentary quotations.In a nutshell, the book is just far too basic, too simplistic and contains no fresh ideas."
4,Good method to help you clarify,"The passion test itself is so simple that once you read it, you can't believe you didn't think of it yourself. Very useful."
4,A clearer path forward,"The book does an excellent job of helping you determine your five greatest passions in a very clear and simple fashion. It devotes half the book to famous people who have adopted the Passion Test in their lives and their first hand descriptions of how it has affected their lives. An easy, quick read that will bring you results and a real insight into yourself."
3,Putting it on the back burner for now...,"Luckily I got this at the dollar $tore. I came here to see if it gets better....a lotta self promotion it seems so far. Will maybe finish some day but doesn't seem helpful so far. I noted that the positive reviews all said REdiscover, REdefine RE everything else. Inotherwords, plain old DISCOVER or DEFINE is not really covered by the authors.I think I will look harder for my old BARBARA SHER books (most of which I bought here on Amazon). She is fabulous for this. And if you want a freebie, I believe WISHCRAFT is still available online somewhere in it's entirety for free. Time for a revisit."
1,Test of Patience,"I am trying to figure out what to do with my life as I am sure many others are. This test was made by people who still don't seem to know what to do with theirs. The authors start out by freely admitting how many times they each have changed their focus and passion throughout their lives. Not exactly who I want to take advice from. The test is sitting down and listing out 10 attributes of your dream life. How did that make a book? There are no new ideas or messages presented. The most telling part of this book however, is that the authors admit you will need to retake the test every six months! EVERY SIX MONTHS! Because your passions and moods change. How will this help me figure out my life if every six months I have to go through this again? I made a mistake purchasing this book based on the hype in the press. I do not recommend that anyone else purchase this book."
2,Being true to form,"With many New Age testaments you find that if something bad happens to you you have created your own reality; and therefore, you are a bad person. The book is shallow and narcissitic and deserves a bad review. Does that make the book bad or me the reviewer bad? (I bet I know!) It uses smoke and mirrors to make you think that you are discovering something very deep about yourself and you won't. There is nothing new or deep about this technique. Keep it simple and you don't have a book. Here is my book for free: Write down 5 things that you are pssionate about and stick with them; don't play shell games to come up with a totally different outcome to make you feel artificailly brilliant."
4,A great book,"I read through this book and completed the exercises. I found it a fantastic way of discovering your true passions, rather than just thinking you know what they are. Turns out what i thought were my top passions, actually were further down the list, so this book has really helped me tailor my life and goals to my true passsions.Highly recommended for those wanting to live the best life they can."
2,not exactly what I had in mind,"reading this book I got the impression that I am being recruited, always needing to purchase something else, read a different book in order to get the ""promises"" made by the authors. This book seems to feed the need of an unsatisfied public, always looking for the ""dream"", in fact very Amway-like in its presentation. Book was used for kindling."
2,CUTE BUT NOT COMFORTABLE!,"I acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit. I even complimented her on them. I liked so much how they looked on her that I took the time to locate them online (Amazon). I ordered them with much anticipation that I would also look cute in them. Needless to say, looks ARE deceiving. Perhaps, they felt better on her than they did on me but I felt like I was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic. I was disappointed. If there's nothing I've learned being a woman in her mid-30s, I come to realize that there's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes..."
3,Easy to walk with them,"This pair is good for walking around. They also look good with ankle long or shorter pants. But after wearing several times, the shoes got streched and my feet tend to slide down further. Sometimes when I walk, my heels would pop out from the shoes and got cut at the edge. I might need to get shoe pads to make them fit my feet better."
2,Cute but uncomfortable and size runs small,I only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute. Other than that they were quite unusable. I usually wear a size 7 but I could not even get my foot into these shoes...and they are quite hard. Had to get rid of them.
3,Not leather as stated!,"Very cute and stylish shoe; however, size was smaller than actual and was not leather as stated. Shoe was returned."
2,cinderella's ugly sister,"size 9.5 fit like it was an 8. I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in, and was unable to walk in them at all without pain. I've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small, but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled."
3,Great Illustrations,"What elevates this book with its so-so rhyming is the quality of the illustrations, which are charming and loaded with personality. However, the idea that a little boy and his dog would be out after dark at a fair is reaching too far. A bit of reality is what makes a children's book relatable for youngsters - and it's somewhat lacking here. But the well-detailed and humorous illustrations redeem this effort."
3,"Sturdy, but heavier than listed","The minute this backpack arrived, I unpacked it, checked (it is all there) and then weighed it. It weighs a full pound over the advertised weight. That is pretty important when backpacking for six months.As far as being functional and sturdy, it is. Have used one before, but was unaware of the weight. It does stand up to a lot of trail abuse."
4,Yummy Pack,I have been in Scouts for 8 Years and this is one of the two packs I've used over that time. I absolutely love this pack. It's comfortable and it has excellent support. It fits everything you need with plenty of space for group gear or extra gear if you have children you are looking after. It has enough external pockets so that you don't have to worry about digging through your pack.I just love it.
3,Not West's finest work,"There are some medium-high points in this volume, but in general the quality of the work is not what I would expect from one of the US's preeminent scholar on race relations. I would describe the tone of this work as very *comfortable*--too comfortable to engage his readers fully. The pieces seem thrown together rather haphazardly, and none really advances much of a claim. For better work by West, try _Keeping Faith_ or his new _Cornel West Reader_."
3,A fair product,"I receieved this product and the knife broke as I attempted to take out of package. Return was seamless and replacement sent,no questions asked."
1,BAD,"This ""pianist"" is one of them who are driving the piano playing and art in general, hundred years back."
