5,This is a book that defies a genre!,"Really, it is a mystery, it is a novel about a hero with autism, it is a coming of age story, it does several things at once. Entertaining, empathetic and irresistible, I think even people unfamiliar with autism would enjoy this book."
4,A bit curious indeed.,"This may be one of the strangest books I have ever read. The entire time I was reading it, I couldn't decide whether I loved it or I hated it. I have never had a book evoke such a curious response from me.After a few strangely numbered chapters, I decided that anyone who can capture my attention and hold it with such a lack of anything actually transpiring, must be worth his salt. I think I ended up liking this book just because it was so very different than other things I have read.The story moves along nicely and makes you think about things that your average novel may not. At times I felt like I was inside the head of this boy, which is a true accomplishment since the book really does not make use of vibrant description which is usually how I judge how real a reading experience was for me.Over all I would Urge you to pick up this book and give it a try. You won't be sorry. It will give you something interesting to talk about in literary circles."
4,Fourteen going on seven years old.,"He's actually older than he seems. He likes Maths. He knows when it's going to be a good day, a super good day or a black day. He's not your typical teenaged protagonist, that's why you keep reading, that's why you feel like you can't leave him... on his journey to discover the end to a mystery, unlocking his own truths while writing his own book.Logical, calculating (literally), and burdoned with a mind so unlike our own, this jem of a novel is a cry for those who can't stop thinking, can't stop noticing everything, can't stop being what they are... and they're sorry.He just wants to feel safe, and you will be when you read Mark Haddon's book. It's an instant *~FAVORITE BOOK EVER~*"
4,An eye-opener!,"This is a story written through the eyes of a mildly autistic boy who is trying to solve the mystery of the neighbour's dog murder, and stumbles into a number of other `revelations' on the way.The book is both moving and funny (in both a laugh-out-loud and a sad kind of way) with an original plot and simple but flowing language, which makes it very easy to read in one sitting.Seeing life from Christopher's `simplified' and inherently logical point-of-view was a real eye-opener for me. And although that's not the purpose of the book, I think that every parent can benefit from this `inside' view of a child's mind.Though it's probably not one of those books that will stay with me for life, it's well worth reading."
4,A Curious Story!,This book was a wonderful surprise. I was not sure of what to expect and was delighted.The story is presented in a very interesting narrative. The fun and simple flow of the book made it addictive to read!
4,An excellent book.,"If you're looking for a quick read, then this is an excellent book. It does everything a longer novel does, like evoking strong emotions, building memorable characters, and providing several twists and turns in an excellent plot.The characters in this novel, and Christopher in particular (the protagonist) really came alive for me. The author manages to make you feel connected with not only Christopher's struggles, but the struggles of those around him.I was amazed by Mr. Haddon's ability throughout this novel."
5,Unputdownable,A wonderfully touching story. One of those writers who points out the poignant bittersweet humour in the difficulties and painful experiences of life. Will have you laughing and then realising you shouldn't be. Makes you feel as if you've witnessed an insight into an otherwise inaccessible mind. I loved it for it's originality and it's excellent style. Read it!
4,Surprisingly Good,I read this book for a book group and wasn't excited about it given the title and book description but I'm very glad I read it. Sometimes sad but very enlightening I enjoyed learning about how an autistic mind works.
1,WORST BOOK I'VE READ (In awhile anyways),"This book was so lame, but I couldnt stop reading, it was like a car wreck where you just cant look away. Afwul! I thought it was going to get better, but it doesn't! SAVE YOUR MONEY! It was basically a story about an autistic boy who screams when anyone touches him & cant stand crowds or yellow. That's basically it. His father is also a freak & his mother leaves, which I so cannot blame her!"
1,What a waste of paper,Crap. Crap. Megacrap. I can't believe so many people enjoyed this crappy book. Maybe I should have read it in third grade. I have never wasted more time on a stupider book in my life. Please don't buy this book.
1,uhhhh.....,i read this book over the summer as a high school reading requirement. I read the whole book but I tell you that it was very painful to read...cause i can say 2 words about it...it sucks. I mean this book had a dry and plain plot with uninteresting characters. Christopher had no personality and his father was a major a**hole. I was tricked into thinking that this was a good book by the synopsis on the back. It was so boring i kept putting it down after ever 17 pages. Besides being boring this book had so much explict languge it's not even funny--they said the f word more than 60 times. Please avoid this book at all costs.
1,the curious incident of the dog in the night-time,"I suppose that I will disagree with everyone else who rated the is book, but I could barely get through the book. I supposed if you're a math nut you would thoroughly enjoy this book, but math is one of the reasons why I thought it totally boring. About half way through the book I almost tossed the book in the trash. I only finished it because I have a policy of finishing what I start. I never appreciate that kind of language in a book especially when it's about a 15 year old boy, I supposed that's supposed to be realism, but all it does is put a stamp of approval to the teenage reader. I found that the further I read I hoped that somebody would do in the boy with the absolutely irritating manner. In my opinion, the boy belonged in a special school for problem children. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,A Delivery Device for the Author's 'Neat Thoughts',"The story of this book is actually pretty cool! I like the whole dog-murder-mystery thing, it was a very neat idea.Unfortunately, this little bit of story is only filler, used in-between the author's little siderants about reality and science. It's cool, I guess any way to get a lot of people exposed to science and philosophical ideas is neat...but it's so forced that I found it a bit painful :(I think it's most interesting how the author chose to deliver these spiffy thoughts of his, though. An autistic character is a clever background reason to go off on 'smart' tangents. If only they were just-as-cleverly integrated into the story, instead of just scattering a story around them.Good book I guess, if you're into that sorta thing."
1,Don't waste your time,Terrible book! Couldn't even finish it! Writing was pathetic but the story was just plain stupid so don't waste your time!
1,sucks,"boaring, sucks, dont bother, sleep thru it, tire some BORING! SUCKS> SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS DONT READ THIS BOOK! IT SUCKS!"
2,A rather mediocre book.,"Another example that what passes for good fiction these days is often just mediocre.The story is not well constructed, the internal workings of the autistic child's brain were often not believable and, more often, uncompelling. He could have done something interesting with this setup, but it seems cheap, hurried, and actually unthoughtful, considering its ambitions.And, really, in the end, it left with the feeling that it was just another cheap novel with more thought going into making it marketable than making it good."
3,A Confusing Let Down,"This book is certainly written from a very unique perspective. The scenario should lead the reader to believe this book was written by an autistic fifteen year old boy. I found the insights about autism to be very eye-opening.At the same time, I wondered if the author had ever been in the company of an autistic person. Just where did Mark Haddon find his insight?The story was weak. I realize this was supposed to be the life of an autistic child, but I found it hard to believe the author needed to go to such depths to explain a dislike for the color yellow.In the end, I stopped reading the book. I hope one day to finish it. Maybe when I can get put aside my scientific brain, and stop questioning the story line."
2,Doesn't Live Up to Hype,"This is another book that becomes the darling of book clubs around the country and turns out to be a big disappointment for me. Yes, it reads fast and yes, it's interesting to be in the mind of a person with autism. But I didn't need 200+ pages of it. I think the plot is simple and it's solved halfway through the book. The rest of the book, mostly the main character's train trip to London, I found boring and frustrating (which might be a point the author was trying to make: autism is indeed very frustrating for those who are close to the patient) after just a few pages. Maybe it's not a great thing that I'm not especially interested in autism and the troubles it causes for those who suffer from it and their close ones, but that must be why I didn't care too much for the book as a whole. Too much of a good thing, even if it was only 220 pages long."
1,Torturous Reading,"If you would like to know more about autism, don't look here. If you want to feel like you have autism, read this book. The story could have been accomplished in fewer than 10 pages with the same message. You've been warned."
2,And then...,"I bought this book because I thought it was a mystery.Because the title is based on a Holmes story.And then I read it.And then there was a murder of a dog.And then there were a lot of logical lessons and math lessons in between the real story.And then I skipped over many of these parts because they were boring.And then I saw that a lot of sentences in this book begin with ""and then"".And then I realized that with the main character being autistic, the author can write like a Special School person, and then I wondered if he could write a real book written like a grownup.And then I looked for a good ending.And then there wasn't one."
1,painful!,"I had so much trouble getting through the book. I think the biggest problem was that the author failed to create sympathy for the main character. I understand he was trying to portray a child that is inflicted with a mental discorder, but he did not humanize christopher at all. As much as I wanted to like the kid, I just couldn't bring myself to relate to him in any sense at all. I wanted to smack the kid.The book uses simple syntax and is relatively easy to read, yet it took me twice as long to finish as most books because I could only take bits of it at a time. The only reason I finished was because I was hoping it would get better - I was wrong. The only thing worse than the lack of a protagonist is the ending that tried to be dramatic, but fell flat.I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy."
1,Almost scratched my eyes out....,"reading this book. For years I have gone by the average ratings on books here on Amazon to pick my reading. This was the first time that failed me. I was bored to tears with this. It is not ""bitterly funny"", ""amazing"", or ""a classic"". I'll give it unique but that's about it. It was like sitting down to read the book of Genesis for me. Yes, I understand that's the whole point: the mind of someone with Autism is so complicated we could never understand. My point is just that: I don't have it, I can't understand, I did not enjoy it."
2,A window into an autistic mind that leaves you exhausted and bored!,"I bought the book based on the recommendations of friends and family. After reading the many positive reviews, I decided to finaly start reading it. I honestly have to say I was very disappointed. While I rarely disagree with Amazon's readers, I have to say this book barely ranks a 2 star. Its an excellent window into an autistic mind if thats what you're looking for, but as a causual read, the author goes off on too many tangents unrelated to the plot. The characters are shallow, and the events that transpire are hardly exciting. It left me exhausted from the constant shifting of subjects, and irrelevant paragraphs. I am utterly surprised at the significant positive feedback this book has received. I dont recommend this book unless you have a vested interest in autism."
2,Put me to Sleep,Everything about this book drove me crazy. It was dry for me and Yes it did put me to sleep. It's the only book i've ever read where i had to put it down not wanting to finish. I did manage to finish it though and i have to say it was one of the worst books i've read.
1,This book does not represent autism.,"Granted this is fiction. Granted that autism is a spectrum disorder. People with autism vary from mildly afflicted to profoundly afflicted, but if I wanted to get an insight into the autistic mind, this book is off course.The child in this book would be classed as extremely high functioning. Not as a kids with autism. Aspergers, almost definately. ANd believe me, there are huge differences between Aspergers and autism. Aspies can talk. Aspies can write. Autism is different. Read Making Peace with Autism by Susan Senator for a real glimpse of autism.For me, a mom with a child with autism, if my child could grow up to be this high functioning, I would be thrilled. This is written by a writer who thinks he has a handle on what autism is. He should come spend a week at our house, or any of the others that I know who have kids with real autism."
3,Curious........,"From the first page, when I discovered the prime numbering of chapters, I did not know what to expect of the main character. I am waiting till bookclub night to have my friends help me un-curious the book."
5,A must read for anyone dealing with Autism or Aspergers,"This book was so wonderful, I bought two; one for me and one to lend."
2,Disappointing,"As much as my friends bragged up this book, I was really expecting something great and deep. Unfortunately, I found the main character more annoying than endearing. While I appreciate what the author was trying to do, I felt like the themes were being spoon-fed to me rather than being presented in an easy to understand way. I tried really hard to like it, and I understand the innovation of the entire story, but I found it more painful than compelling."
2,If you like 'Dick and Jane' you'll love this.,"Maybe this is exactly how a boy with Asperger's syndrome would think and write (I admit, I have no idea), but this book was a little too easy to read. The story is pretty good, and telling the story in the boy's words is clever, but I got a little tired of it before I reached the end."
3,Not Quite,"This was a nice, cutesy read, but having just finished Jonathan Safron Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, I felt that this novel paled in comparison. If you enjoyed CURIOUS INCIDENT, you should check out Foer's novel. Very similar but with finer form and sharper humor."
2,Don't bother,"This is the most modiocre book ever written. It does nothing for the reader. If you have a couple of hours to waste, pick up this boring mystery."
4,See life from another point of view,"This was a very interesting look into the world of autism. Knowing absolutely nothing previously of this condition, Christopher's first person narration clearly illustrated the way he thought and lived. The story begins when he finds his neighbor's dog cruelly murdered, and he decides to use his detecting skills to figure out who did it and why. His lack of emotion, brilliant mathematical skills, and innocence of one not knowing how to lie makes for a unique outlook on life, relationships and science. A nice change from the usual, I recommend."
4,very curious indeed!,"As the other amazon.com reviewers have glowingly commented, 'The Curious Incident...' is really a unique reading experience. Any book which is written in the first person, narrated by a teenager, a teenager with autism no less, has to be considered special. Fortunately the author treats this young man and his long-suffering parents with dignity. It never degrades to a tear-jerker, nor does the author resort to sterotypes.As for the story, well ... the title says it all. It is simply about a very bizarre incident in the life of this autistic young man and how he responds to it. It's equally humorous, sad and touching.Bottom line: the sort of book you'd loan to your friends."
3,"Interesting concept, OK execution","While I admire the book's attempt to tell a story from an unusual perspective, it's just not that compelling a story. It also reflects the trend of these kind of ""book club books"" that are kind of simple to read and told from the perspective of an adolescent (two other examples being The Secret LIfe of Bees and Life of Pi). But as a narrative and human story, it was just so-so for me.To see just how flat these modern novels told from a child's perspective really are (from the literary and emotional perspectives), read Huckleberry Finn or To Kill a Mockingbird, and see if you can really give novels like The Curious Incident . . . 5 stars. Come on, now!"
4,"Interesting idea, well executed; uplifting for autistic parents and kids","A first person narrative from the perspective of an autistic savant, this is a fine book. Successful on most levels and a satisfying read, it's well worth reading for anyone who knows autistic kids or parents, and these days that's a lot of people.I found parts of it quite moving, and parts quite depressing...but realistic depictions of daily British city life will do that. Haddon paints a solid portrait of our unlikely hero and it's hard not to end up loving the kid a whole bunch.A quick and enjoyable read with layers of emotional depth; well worth sharing with your adolescent kids. It's never too early to help them accept all types of people and all levels of intellectual ability."
4,Interesting inside view,This is a great insider's view of the mind of an autistic boy. The way he thinks and observes things in his life is amazing. While it seems like a mystery story it is much more! Great read!
4,Read Conan Doyle First .,"If you decide to read this book, it is a good idea to read the story by Conan Doyle, mentioned by Christopher, first.'Curious Incident' is not just a clever first-person narrative from the point of view of an autistic kid, it is also a clever reworking of Doyle's story, which makes it the more meaningful. A great read."
4,3 yellow cars,"This novel brings the reader right into the world and thought process of the main character. It reads less like a detective novel (to which the reviews seem to have tied it down with) and more as a character analysis of autism. The pages fly by, not in an attempt to solve who-dunit, but to find out what will be said or done next. An entire universe of logic unfolds that the adult mind has trouble understanding, and yet Mark Haddon has used his years of experience to bring forward a very memorable literary character. I found the solution to the murder mystery slightly out of flow with the rest of the novel (as well as out of character) but it did not lessen my overall enjoyment."
4,curious incident,"Great book written or narrated by an individual with Asperger's Not Autism. Fascinating to read, great detail and perspective on this disorder. Touching but not maudlin. The contrast of his 'logic' with the drama around him fills the book with dimension."
4,The Curious Incident of a Dog in the Night-Time,"The Curious Incident of a Dog in The Night-Time Vintage Books, a division of Mark Haddon Random House Inc., 2003, $12.95, ISBN: 1-4000-3271-7I find people confusing. This is for two main reasons. The first is that people do a lot of talking without using any words. (pg. 14)Christopher Boone thinks differently than most of us because he is autistic. Christopher grew up happily with his father and mother until she mysteriously passed away. At his school for kids with special needs, Christopher loves math. He hopes that one day his math skills will allow him to get into a ""normal"" school. Christopher's friend and teacher ,Sioban, helps him write about the murder of his neighbor's"
5,Brilliant and unusual!,"I'll never forget reading this. It is wonderful, especially if you work with or know kids who are ""interesting"" Buy this and keep it. You won't be disappointed."
4,An odd read,"Hard to say. This book is an odd read. It is certainly light reading, and faxcinating in it's perspective. The most interesting part of the read is living the part of the autistic youngster and seeing and feeling the world through his senses.This book is one you need to be in the right mood for. The first time I picked it up, I read 40 pages and was tempted to junk it. A month later, I picked it up and found it engrossing."
2,"Interesting enough plot, but Christopher = TERRIBLE","The first 100 pages or so was quite interesting and I was glued to this novel. By the time Christopher feared his father though, it was as if the novel did a total 360 turn; it became quite difficult to get through the pages and I found myself skimming through the rest of the book. Christopher's character became very annoying and unlikeable to me, for he was obviously selfish, cold, and detached from the attempts of both parents to reach out to him. I found myself sympathizing with his mother, since it becomes obvious that Christopher is quite a handful."
3,OK if you don't mind finishing a book in three hours.,"I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. I always thought of it as an Oprah book, which I guess is not true, but the copy I was given does have a Today's Book Club logo printed on to the actual cover. It has a really terrific, hooky beginning, and Christopher's voice is consistent and believable. My problem with it is this: Although I loved the plot of the second half of the book and the descriptions of Christopher on the busses and trains, I found some major plot points were forced/not worked out as well as I thought they needed to be. Plus it was almost too quick of a read. That being said, some of the writing when Christopher is just musing on stuff is downright poetic, like the scene where he's saying how constellations are just silly and arbitrary, and how the stars are just nuclear explosions millions of miles away. I'd be excited to see if his next book is a little more ambitious; he probably has the talent to pull it off."
3,Air Mail,"The air mail delivery must have been by pigeon because it took 4 weeks to get here. Book arrived in good condition but, probably won't order from England again."
4,Great insight,"This book was so strange and interesting and weird and different. I'm a big fan of innovation in books and movies, and this Haddon has succeeded in writing a book that's very different from any that I've read before. The book is written in first person and the protagonist is autistic, although he doesn't ever describe himself using that word. I was so impressed by the way that Haddon describes the protagonist's thought processes - it makes the autistic behavior that we consider strange (hitting, screaming, curling up in a ball) seem reasonable and sensible."
4,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"A wonderfully smart and interesting book. Mark Haddon's protagonist is a combination of Benjy (from William Faulkner's Sound and Fury) and Rain Man (from the movie of the same name). Christopher John Francis Boone, the protagonist/narrator takes us on a breath-taking ride through the sometimes brilliant yet often tormented mind of an autistic individual. The sense of right and wrong exhibited by Christopher, his moral values, and his insistence on protecting the weaker of God's creatures, will touch every conceivable emotion. This book is well worth your time.E. PerryToronto"
5,This kid drove me nuts!,"I didn't much care for the protagonist of this terrific novel--and that's a compliment to the author! I felt sorry for Christopher and I now understand the overwhelming world that autistic children must deal with if they are survive with any chance of success. But Christopher's screaming--he's 15!--at the littlest provocations really provoked a strong reaction in me. For an author to create a character whom I knew I would personally struggle to like, and yet to keep me very involved in his story, is a true accomplishment. I know I would not be a good parent for an autistic child, more like Christopher's mother than his ever-patient father. Christopher is at times likeable, at times irritating (for me, mostly the latter), but I did enjoy the book, I learned a lot from reading it, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who might come into contact with autistic people."
4,Little book with lots of content,"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time by Mark Haddon is a different kind of mystery. The dog Wellington is dead, stabbed with a pitchfork and fifteen year old Christopher has decided to be a detective and discover who the murderer is. Unlike the usual mystery hero, Christopher is autistic and the story is told from his point of view. At first Christopher himself is a mystery because of the way he perceives what's happening around him. The things he finds difficult, unpleasant and frightening and how he deals with them creates the suspense that makes this simple tale a marvel of complexity. As he gathers his clues you come to know a different kind of person and can't help but to admire his courage and steadfastness. This is a story about strengths and weaknesses and how people cope with life. By the end you discover that at his core, Christopher is really not so different than the rest of us."
4,Dogs 'n stuff,I really enjoyed this book. The narrator is young autistic boy who makes an for interesting commentator. My only complaint is that this book is quite short and I could have used a bit more fleshing out of the story.
4,well written story about a dead dog,"This book was definitely not what I expected.I didn't know I was about to read Christopher's (a 15 year of boy with autism) story.That being said we follow Christopher on his adventure as he tries to figure out who killed the neighbors dog. The book is written from his point of view and seems very simplistic but helps greatly with character development. Although Christopher lacks basic ""emotions"", the book allows the reader to feel the emotions for him, and it works quite well. The book has many heartfelt moments and a few good twists.Christopher is very good at 'maths' and includes diagrams and mathematical examples throughout his book. Some of which are quite interesting.All in all an entertaining quick read."
4,Great book,I read this for a college course but this book is great for many age levels. I think this book would be great for middle school children and older. It has elements of adventure and mystery. The boy telling the story sees the world in a different and extremely enlightening way. Family relationships also play an important role in the story. I would definitely recommend this book.
4,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,I enjoyed this book very much. The author did a wonderful job writing using the perspective viewpoint of the autistic child. I will recommend this book to friends.
4,Curiously Interesting,"What an interesting book! I wasn't sure I was going to like it at first, as the style is not something I am used to. But the story line brings you in, and I found this to be such an interesting look into the life of a family through the simplicity and honesty of Christopher's mind.The book made me sad, happy, giggle, and finally proud with a touch of sorrow.Very well written interesting read, I highly recommend."
5,important correction,"Autism is not a mental illness. It is a neurological disorder. This is a very important distinction. Autistic people may have sensory disorders, social and communicative limitations, but are not mentally ill. In fact, no two Autistic people are alike in how the disorder presents itself. As a disorder that is appearing by leaps and bounds and without apparent warning, it is important that we understand Autism to be alert for early warning signs in children and to support and help those who do and will develop autism."
5,utterly original and one of my favorites,"This was one of my favorite books of the year. Although it is very original, it did remind me of Motherless Brooklyn which tells a detective story through a child with Turret's Syndrome. Haddon in this novel captures perfectly a high functioning autistic child who decides to write a novel about the search for the cold blooded murderer of his neighbor's poodle with a garden fork. His quest leads to all sorts of interesting discoveries about those around him. I don't want to give away the plot, but you won't be able to put down this highly original book. The attention to details and the care Haddon takes in drawing his main character shows and makes this a highly accomplished and most memorable novel."
2,Boring,"I don't understand all the applause on this dry, boring, story.There are plenty of other books in the library. May I suggest that you pick another."
3,Very curious,"I found the book very well written - and felt it very realistic in many respects. He is a very gifted writer. However, I found the blatant swearing and blasphemies unnecessary and they (for me) detracted from the story and I would find it hard to recommend it to others for that reason."
2,Typical NT author...,"He had it right, but over did it. I don't care how many Aspies he's spoken with, they aren't freaks like he makes Christopher seem to be at times.I read it, attended the panel discussion at school on it, then donated it to the school library. I think it was over-hyped, probably because it was supposedly the first of it's kind. Just as a man can't write a book on how it is to be pregnant, an NT shouldn't try writing a book on how it is to be an Aspy.Oops!NT = (N)eurotypical (T)hinker. Aspy term for everyone else.Aspy = Person with Asperger Syndrome. Supposedly the main character in the story has Asperger's. But..."
2,It's been done better before.,"Mark Haddon's novel is all about voice, and in that sense the book is a success. Writing from the perspective of an autistic teenager must be quite a challenge, and Haddon succeeds admirably. However, every other aspect of the novel (characters, plot, pacing) is a dismal failure. There are many other books that have written from a perspective of adolescent benightment and have accomplished the task in a superior manner(10th Grade, by Weisman, or Rule of the Bone, by Banks). A mediocre novel that is only seeing success due to its novel narrative voice and the ease with which it is digested. Too light to have much of an impact, but the subject matter renders it too heavy to be funny. And it ends very, very abruptly, in an unsatisfactory manner."
3,Moderately interesting but eventually tiresome,"I bought this book on the basis of glowing reviews: ""Amazing,"" ""Fascinating detective story,"" etc. Actually, the detective part of the story doesn't last too long. And the regular tangents that give us insight into autism eventually become tiresome. I flipped through the last one-third of the book because I was no longer interested in these lengthy and largely irrelevant sidebars, and just wanted to find out what happened in the end. Even that wasn't too interesting."
3,a well-written book,"I liked the book ""The Curious Incident of the Dog.."" although I didn't find it as brilliant as other reviewers have done. This novel brings the reader right into the world and thought process of the main character, an autistic boy named Christopher. Mark Haddon really gives the reader an insight into the world of autism. The narrator, Christopher, describes the book as a detective novel, however I believe it is really about facing your fears and doing things you didn't know you could.I would recommend this book but don't have too high expectations when you start to read because it is easy to get disappointed..."
3,A Riveting Case Study for Psychology Students,"Both moving and captivating, The Curious Incident of a Dog in the Night-Time is a novel just oozing with bits of wisdom. Coming from the head of a teenage autistic boy, Mark Haddon instantly hooks readers through his portrayal of Christopher John Francis Boone. Christopher, who knows everything about science and math but cannot connect with the emotions he sees, attempts to solve a murder mystery after his neighbor's dog is killed. In the process he uncovers the truth about his mother and the series of events unravel in the most unusual and improbable way. Christopher's thoughts and feeling envoke empathy. Anyone who is interested in the behavior of autistic children and is also looking for some laughs should run to the store and buy this book. It's a novel you won't want to miss!"
5,Very enjoyable (thumbs up),"Prior to reading this book, I knew little about autism but I have seen such children and their behavior before... which makes it easier to relate to the book. I must say, the book is a delight! It's different, light and interesting because its evolving around a boy who's not our usual Tim or Jim in high school..started with an unusual dog murder..very interesting ideas really! Good book! I just kept reading it non-stop!!I love the book and I definitely recommend it.By the way, the hardcover was worth it. Nice :) Enjoy the book!"
3,A Glimpse Into The Mind Of An Autistic Child,"This story is told by 15 year old Christopher Boone who is autistic. He discovers his neighbor's dog killed with a pitchfork and decides to solve this mystery. The view of the world through the eyes of an autistic child is very enlightening and well presented by the author. About halfway through the book, the dog's murderer is revealed and one of the hooks for the story is lost, but it sets up the plot for the second half of the story. Fear is the major motivation in Christopher's life and he shows a great deal of courage in overcoming his fears. At times Christopher's ramblings were repetitive and tedious. His emotional disconnection to the people in his life was disturbing and very depressing. I was impressed with the idea for this book. It is an ambitious attempt to understand the workings of the autistic mind. However, the later stages of this story were rather dark and I was relieved to have finished it and to get my mind back to my `normal' life."
5,Fascinating Glimpse into Autism,"As a veteran school psychologist, I was amazed at how well Mark Haddon captured what I see are some of the key features of autism. From my perspective, he did a wonderful job of portraying what it might be like to be an individual with autism, giving concrete examples (like the inability to read the facial expressions and emotions of others) and other insights.I've recommended this book to parents and fellow educators as well as friends as an extremely readable foray into the world of autism."
5,One of the Two Best Books of the Year,"""The Curious Incident . . . ."" and ""The Locklear Letters,"" both amazon.com ""breakout books,"" have restored my faith in fiction. They're my two favorite books of the year -- both are clever, quick reads that give their readers a great deal of credit -- and I go back and forth over which one is my favorite. Here's the solution: read them both and decide for yourself!"
5,Excellent and enlightening read,"This book is a very good read, and it is very enlightening on the world of an autistic child. I knew only a little about what it means to be autistic and it was definitely an eye opener to view this mindset. I feel that this story is more like a story within a story- you read about the thoughts and actions of this autistic boy, but soon see through the boy's words and realize the adult reality of what he does not comprehend. I enjoyed Haddon's writing style very much and I definitely recommend this book to others. This book is NOT what I term ""brain candy."" It is a solid piece of well-written fiction."
3,"Unique and intelligent, but I wanted a little more",I understand what the authors intentions were and he did a great job with writing like someone with what can possibly be a character with Asperger's. I really would have loved more of the trials examined when trying to find his mom in London and also more elaboration on the dynamics between mother and father as seen through the child's eyes after his mom is found alive and wants to take part in his life.
3,"Not a book for a child, but a child's book","This book is written from the perspective of a 15 year old boy with autism. As a book written by a child it's a good read. As a literary work of art, it's fair. It's well written in that you feel like you're truly listening to a high functioning autistic teen, but the story really goes nowhere."
4,Interesting point of view and story,"Anyone who is close to an autistic person must wonder about how he or she truly sees the world. We can never know, but this book offers some interesting insights into what it might be like. Every person with autism is different, but for me many of the characteristics of the main character rang true to the autistic person in my life--for instance, how he can understand complex math equations but not be able to read a novel. I don't know what Mark Haddon's background is, but I do think he did a great job of drawing what life might be like from inside one autistic person's mind. Because the main character's focus is on concrete sensations and objects, it actually helps create a stronger picture in your mind of what he is going through. Scenes such as how he experiences a busy train station or finding a series of letters really puts you in the character's situation."
4,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the night-time,"The curious incident of the dog in the night-timeThe novel ""The curious incident of the dog in the night-time"" deals with a boy named Christopher who has the Asperger's syndrome. One night he finds his neighbour's dog lying on the ground dead. Christopher wants to find out who the murderer was.While I was reading the story I tried to pick up some information about the Asperger's syndrome. As a result I can say that Mark Haddon wrote a terrific novel from an Asperger's syndrome's patient's point of view.Although I think the ending is too long, it is a very interesting book for people who like funny novels with a touch of crime and maths."
1,I don't get it. The best thing about it is the cover.,"I don't ever write reviews but I had to say something about this book. Stabbing a poodle with a pitchfork? How do you go somewhere after that, which justifies a gesture that does nothing but makes you sick? You don't. And clearly, the writer didn't. I wonder what he pitch forks in his next book? A gerbel?"
1,Avoid,"Avoid this book! I think this is a real story and I pity the parents of the main character Christopher. What a pompous, ignorant and self-absorbed child. And a caution to all the parents ""do not ever let your child read this book"" they can get ideas!"
3,Light read,"Light, pretty easy ready. Mark does a great job of narrating from an autistic teen's POV. However, that was about it for me. Didn't get too wrapped up in the actual story line, I just enjoyed the frame of reference."
4,Unique and entertaining,"Narrated solely by an autistic teenage boy, the book takes us through his perceptions of his surroundings, from his daily school activities, neighbors and parents' divorce. The plot itself isn't groundbreaking, but the delivery of it is interesting and absorbing; you really get the feel that he is talking to you directly. I would recommend this book for its unique story telling effects. It was a quick and very entertaining book to read on a train ride."
5,Cheer him on,"This fresh and original tale, told from the viewpoint of an autistic boy, will make you laugh, cry and think all at the same time. The boy, Christopher, can give you the answer to 251 x 864 in a second, but can't figure out how other people think. You'll fall in love with this young man and cheer him on as he tries to sort out his life with a mind that can't filter out excess information."
2,Just not my cup of tea..,Autistic child and his life dealing with separated parents in England. Recommended for parents with similar children. Kept my interest but just barely.
2,dissapointed!,"within a week of recieving this book, the whole binder fell apart-apparently it was not made very well.very dissapointed, all the pages are out of the book."
2,Review on a no so good book.,"The author sussefully captured how an autistic person might think, but I still really didn't like the book. In the beginning, the main character was happy with his life. After the events in the book, it becomes evedent that the main character won't ever be happy with his life again. A book should be about growth, and I fell the character does the opposite."
2,The literary equivalent of Ocean's Eleven,"Good things about this book: it's a page turner and it gives a very good picture of how autism (technically Asperger syndrome) plays out for an indivual person. Bad thing: that's ALL the book is about. There is very little beyond the plot - it's the literary equivalent of Ocean's Eleven: entertaining while you're in it, forgettable when you're done. While I don't mind this quality in a movie, I find it very disappointing in a book - certainly in part because of the difference in time commitments."
2,started out great and but didn't finish well..,"The first 150 pages of this book where great. The story was interesting, smart and funny. The last 100 pages went downhill for me. It seemed to drag from that point forward - you didn't learn any new about the main character and it seemed to get lost in the details of science and math."
5,who knew an orange book could be so good?!,"i was in the bookstore one day, itching fo rsomething interesting to read when i came across this book. It was orange and i like orange and it sounded interesting enough so i picked it out and bought it. To my surprise it was absolutley wonderful. i could not put it down. I read it about 3 times and i didn't let anyone read it. if you buy this book, you will not regret it. It is wonderful. ABSOLUTLEY GENIUS! It was inceredibly insightfull, and it made you think, but not in an annoying way."
3,ok but not worth all the hype about it,"I give it 3.5 stars because it was interesting to see inside Christopher's daily life as an autistic person. I felt the story was too harsh and while it was good written from his perspective, it lacked in a softness that the plot needed considering the situation.Christopher is a teenager with 'special needs'; he goes to a special school where he excels. His parents have their own battles and his mother dies but a twist encounters the reader regarding this part.It was fascinating in parts, again dealing with autism, but the plot was not as good as I'd assume given the marketing hype over the book."
2,In Poor Taste,"I'm surprised by the glowing reviews this book got. I really thought it was a terrible diservice to ""aspie"" people. The boy seems to not care about anyone and the adults in this book are all totally screwed up. I don't like the connection that people are bound to make that the parents of children with autism can't handle the complex life they have been given. While well written in a literary sense, this book leaves you sad and feeling as though people are truly pathetic. Not a good read at all and not at all a true vision of what autism really looks like."
2,The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night Time,"I didnt' really enjoy this novel. I liked the writing style, but I didn't like the story. I like reading classic books or plays. I don't like reading about kids with personal problems unless there is a lesson involed in it. Christopher Boone was a very spastic thinker and it was very hard to connect with the character."
3,Middle Ground,"""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time"" is not an unenjoyable reading experience. It's alright. I wasn't overwhelmed, but I had no problem enjoying the book. I wouldn't put it on a ""must read"" list, but it's overall pretty good."
3,Charming and yet tiresome,"It's charming to see a novel point of view, but I never really got pulled into this work of fiction. Are so-called neurotypicals really intrigued and mystified by a seemingly autistic train of thought?"
3,I'm not sure....,"This book was a puzzling one to me. It was good, but...It was fun, but then...This book perplexes me, that is all I can say. It was good, but not THAT good. I can't even tell you what it's about. I say this is a good time-filler, but other then that, it isn't really all that good."
3,Unrealistic and a bit cloying,"_The Curious Incident_ attempts to critique ""normal"" thinking by viewing it from an outsider's perspective--in this case, an autistic ""savant"" 15 year-old.The plot is the best thing about the book. With its ""mystery"" element, it holds the reader's attention.However, the protagonist's narration is so deliberately stylized that it soon becomes cloying.I have read arguments that the book attempts to unrealistically ""hero-ize"" autism. Having spent a couple of years raising an autistic step-daughter, I would agree.The book is best taken as social criticism, and it is an interesting read overall."
1,Terribly disappointing...,"I had really high hopes for this book after reading the many online and print reviews. I've heard from numerous people who loved this book. I just don't happen to be one of them, I guess.Ultimately, I do not find Christopher to be a sympathetic character, and the writing style, told first-person from Christopher's POV, is highly irritating. Almost all of the sentences start with the word ""And,"" and it is normal for a sentence to actually be a series of sentences, strung into a very long paragraph that I suppose is meant to represent Christopher's speaking style. I will still admit that I read this book very quickly, and I was extremely interested in finding out what happened. However, I can't say I enjoyed this book. It irritated me far more than it entertained me. I suppose I should have given Christopher a greater leeway since he is autistic, but I just couldn't muster up enough sympathy for Christopher."
1,no need for the language!!!,"Right when i opened the book I saw the f word twice on the second page! Everytime I would turn the page there was a cuss word on almost every page! It is not necessary to use that language in this book. I would not reccomend it to anyone who doesnt want to read a book that can't just be normal. It has to be ""cool"" by using the language. IT IS NOT NECESSARY!!!! Don't read this book expecting it to be cute and fun and clean!!!"
2,My review,"I am disappointed about the book ""The curious incident of the dog in the night-time"". When I read the cover of the book and saw the list of the prizes it won, I thought it is a really good written and thrilling book!The story about the autistic boy is good but from time to time the book is written boring and some chapters tell stories, which have nothing to do with the real story.All in all I am not exhausted from the book, even if the story is great."
4,Look at the Language,"The book was very interesting. It made you want to keep reading. I read and moticed that it cussed a lot. When Christopher tells the story he enters everything into the book. Cussing and all. I had to do it for a school report, and thankfully my teacher hadn't read the book yet. :P I encourage you to read the book if you think that your life suxs. I know that it's fiction, but it seems real."
2,A big let-down,"The number one thing I look for in a book is good writing. Sorry, but you will not find that in ""The Curious Incident..."". Of course, that is to an extent deliberate - the author is assuming the voice of a young man with Asperger's Syndrome. But the repetitive, flat, emotionless style drove me mad after the first 50 pages and there weren't enough compensations in the ""mystery"" plot - soon solved and forgotten about, or the adult characters - unlikeable and implausible - to keep me going. I borrowed this book from someone at work. They will probably think me cold and heartless for not liking it. Oh, well."
3,Only interesting if you don't know about autism,"Knowing a bit about autism I guess may have detracted from my enjoyment of this book. Whilst this was a refreshing way of writing, it is certainly not a literary masterpiece, though I guess it does not pretend to be one. The story itself, given it is fiction, is a little weak, and I found in parts a little laboured. If you want to see things from the autistic point of view please go for this text-all the classic traits are carefully presented. As a story per se...too depressing for me. By the way the authors atheist perspective is unnecessarily utilised here when it need not be mentioned at all."
3,Could have been better,"I thought this book could have been better a lot of ways. Perhaps because this type of book (a person with disabilities writing journal style) has been done before in ""Flowers for Algernon,"" which I found to be a much better book.I understand that Christopher is just a child and everything is written from his perspective, but I can't help but wish for more depth from all the characters. I also found it difficult to garner sympathy for his parents, who are both selfish in their own way."
2,Most people seem to love this book..,"..but I didn't like it at all. I only finished this book because it was so short. The robot-like personalities of autistic people translate well on screen, but not in print. The story was boring and wooden and I felt no attachment at all to any of the characters. So many times I read a book, love it, and then see that someone gave it a terrible review. ""How could they?"", I think to myself. Now I know."
2,Monotonous,"The beginning of this book had a ""grab you"" moment, and that was the end of the interest. I had chosen this book for my book club without having read it beforehand and concensus among my fellow readers ... worst book read by our club. We all agreed that to live a life with aspergers, autism, etc. is extremely difficult for everyone involved. The book did give you a good incite into what goes on in the mind of someone afflicted, but there wasn't any cohesive plot to follow to make it interesting. We all felt that due to the lack of a good story, it made this book very monotonous. Sorry."
2,"In The End, Just Boring","Alas, I read the 52 or so pages of the excerpt with breathless excitement. However, after buying the book, it began to be a real slog to read it, mainly because of all of the irrelevant ""autistic atmosphere"" that the author felt compelled to continue to blast out in giant clouds throughout the entire store. I eventually realized that there was no story, and was a little sorry to see a book that started so promisingly spend its last fifty pages just choking out in the sand, like a river never reaching the sea."
3,Not realistic,"I've been interested in reading this book for awhile so when I found out that I had to read it for class I was relieved thinking that I would enjoy 'school reading'. At first, I was confused thinking that the author had autism himself. But without having to look it up, I noticed in the writing that the author was writing as if he was autistic.Although some of Christopher's behaviors are true to the description of autism, such as everything needing to have an order and being very specific in what people say. However, if you pay close attention you can find contradictions within pages of each other. I've read that Haddon has had experience working with people with autism, but that does not mean that he knows how an autistic mind works 100% of the time.Regardless, I did enjoy the book and thought it was funny and portrayed a person with autism relatively well. I just would have enjoyed it better if it was actually written by a person with autism."
3,Don't Regret Reading It.,"I don't regret reading this book at all. Although I did find myself getting very upset with the lack of detail, and the jumpy aspect of the narrator. This book isn't bad, it's just very - well unchallenging. Doesn't make you think, wonder, or investigate... Very straight forward and quite cliched. I found myself at more than one point waiting for the story to begin and then realizing that I was most of the way through the book. But it made me laugh and held my attention form start to finish. I mostly give it 3 stars due to the fact that I was hoping for something a little more stimulating."
5,Couldn't put this book down!!,This is my new favorite book! Clever & brilliant! I only wish that this author had another for me to read! :o( Crossing my fingers for a sequel!!!
5,Great for all ages!,"Was lent the book by a london friend and read it in one day! Such a beautiful story (despite the dead dog). Because it's told in the first person, the reader really gets a sense of how the mind of the narrator works, learns to sympathize with him, and eventually comes to accept his bahavior as quite acceptable given his circumstances. A great lesson to learn."
4,The Biggest Mystery is the Mind Itself,"I had a little trouble getting into this novel as the narrator's voice is one you will rarely encounter. I, however, found that by about page 12 I was intrigued and could not put this book down.The novel is very well crafted. The author is able to sustain the voice of a young autistic boy and yet weave a real mystery with twists and turns. His narrator also grows as the mystery of his mind and life is examined. I think by the time you are done reading you will not only feel compassion but will also feel a connection with someone you may not have imagined being kindred with before.This was a wonderful read."
4,Interesting Look at Another world,"Fifteen year-old Christopher Boone, a high-functioning autistic, is the narrator of this quirky tale. When Christopher finds a neighbor's dog impaled on a garden fork, he decides to solve the mystery of the dog's death. While Christopher does not feel much of an emotional connection to most people (including his own father), he feels that the dog's death is heinous murder. In the course of his investigation, he finds out much more than he bargains for. A really interesting look at the thought processes of the autistic. I found myself laughing to keep from crying at some of the situations Christopher gets himself into, and felt great sympathy for his working-class parents who seem more than a little overwhelmed by Christopher's care."
4,through the looking glass.........,"I thought this was an amazing book. Not since The Lovely Bones, have I been drawn so completely into the mind and world of another character.What I loved about this book, was that the author made no judgements of any of the characters, but simply allowed the drama to play itself out.I've had the honor and pleasure of working with autistic children, and what I learned, and I think what the author is successful in showing, is that there may be some differences in how autistic people deal with the world, but that we all have unique coping skills, and theirs are perhaps extreme, but maybe not as unusual as we would like to think..Take a chance - if you are an adventurous person when it comes to books, I don't think you will regret this journey!"
3,Good-ish.,"I would actually give this book 3.5 stars I think. It was a very interesting glimpse into how the mind works of one individual with Autism...obviously this is not representative of the thoughts and behaviors of all with Autism. Behaviors that may seem irrational and highly unpredictable (like hitting a police officer) suddenly make sense when relayed through the main characters thought processes.There was a lot of additional/useless information in this book. I understand the purpose of these meanderings was to support the premise that the author is autistic, but it was difficult to wade through. However, after a slow start the story line really picked up and kept me reading.Also note that this book has a LOT of cursing (mostly the F word).overall, an interesting read, but too drawn out, read. i would recommend it to those interesting in the topic of Autism, but would not recommend it to others outside of that mindset."
4,Great Book!,My daughter is reading this for her 10th grade English class. She loved it and wanted me to read it. It really gives you insight as to how a person with autism thinks.
5,"Deserves 6, 7 or even 20 stars!!","Everyone in the world should read this book. There are so many Christophers out there struggling to find their way. Maybe this book can make a difference so people can just let them live in peace and achieve their dreams. I am the mother of a 20-yr-old Aspergers son. A brilliant mind seeking each day to simply live in this sometimes difficult world. This book gives a rare, accurate peek into the autistic mind. It is amazingly accurate. Allow yourself the chance to go there. You will be forever changed, and never, never regret it."
5,Great Book - you won't be able to put it down!,Just a wonderful and quick read - like candy to any book lover!
4,Curiously Good!,"I didn't buy this book when it first came out because it looked like too much of a quick read and I wanted more pages for my money. However, I have finally gotten around to reading it and I'm very glad I did.Whilst I don't really know anything about autism, it was interesting to read a novel based on a young autistic person's point of view. Christopher is trying to solve the mystery of who killed his neighbour's dog, however the story quickly changes about midway through and starts focusing on Christopher's relationship with his family. There are a few surprises along the way and moments of humour as well (particularly in the footnotes).The writing style is simple but very effective. Being only a relatively short novel, the story moves along quickly through necessity so there are no slow, drawn-out sections. I finished this book in about 3 hours but it was time well spent and I look forward to reading more of this author's work as it's published."
5,Amazed at how realistic this is,"This is quite an incredible book. I do not know Mr. Haddon's background but I suspect that he must have some experience in dealing with autistic children. There is no way he could write such a stellar and accurate book without this knowledge. Having had a great deal of experience with autistic people personally, I can vouch for the accuracy of this author in portraying the social behaviors and characteristics associated with autism.Mr. Haddon certainly has a gift for telling a great story. More importantly he can tell this story while being bounded by character development and staying true to the condition of autism. What is most rare, perhaps, is that Mr. Haddon can make us feel so strongly for Christopher, even though Christopher himself is unable to deal with the rest of us.This is a book I recommend without hesitation."
3,Insightful Read,"Although a work of fiction, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is a surprisingly insightful journey into the world of one Autistic boy. A great read for those new to the world of Autism, or looking for a non-technical window into how the disorder could affect one individual. Written with compassion and clarity, it is a quick read, can easily be completed in a day or two, and is suitable for teen readers. I found it to be moving, memorable and somewhat mind-expanding. Any good book will give you the opportunity to mentally 'try on someone else's shoes', this book will put you inside the mind that many will find unfamiliar, perplexing, perhaps even alien, but not without it's charms. For those looking for a comprehensive look at Autism, this book will not be a good choice, as Autism spans a vast rainbow of symptoms and behaviors, and this book is written from singular experience."
4,"This book gets ""curiouser and curiouser""!","This was one odd book. I must say the author must be one strange individual. Although it seemed like most of the time you were in the mind of a mentally challenged youth, sometimes the hard cold truths were difficult to take. It was very entertaining, if at times uncomfortable to read. I guess that's what makes it, in the end, so thought-provoking."
5,What a great read,This was an absolutely wonderful journey with an inspired and inspiring hero. This is simply a must read.
4,Good book,"Very good book, well written. Interesting to see things through the eyes of an autistic child. Quick and easy read."
4,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,I totally enjoyed this book. I have worked with autistic children for about 6 years now and could so see some of the kids that I worked with in this book. Mr. Haddon grasp the mind of someone with autism probably as good as anyone without it could. A delightful read that had tender moments and sheds much light on the fact that everyone's mind does not perceive things the same way.
2,Interesting at times,"The book provided what appeared to me (someone with no special knowledge or experience with autism) to be a realistic portrait of the condition. I did find the writing to be self-conscious in a distracting way: we, as the readers, are so clearly meant to be taken on a journey led by the author. In that way, I was annoyed by the book, because it seemed to be using the naive perspective of the lead character as almost a trick--hiding the ball from the reader. Because of the perspective, the book is limited and cannot really speak to universal truths. It is more like a parlor trick. There is value in sharing the perspective of autism with the general population, and I don't mean to belittle that, but it's almost like this book wants to define autism for the reader and give pat insights into the experience of autism that can be used by the reader to feel like they have contained and comprehended what is certainly a complex and, in many ways, unfathomable condition."
4,Not for Everyone...,"I loved this book but it is my opinion that it is definately not for everyone. My feelings about this were confirmed after reading some of the other reviews. It seems most people either loved it or hated it, with not a lot of in-between.The reason I am giving this book only 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found that the last part of the book seemed to drag by for me. I ploughed through the first half at lightening speed but it really started to slow down about half way thru. The things that I found so cute and funny and ingenious in the beginning lost their luster for me.Aside from that, I loved this book! I felt that I learned more about autism from reading it. It was definately different than any other book I have ever read and very charming."
3,"Interesting, Different, Simple and informative","This is a book about the life and thought process that an autistic teen experiences, and the reactions of family an others. It made me think about how I tend to expect others to have the same thought process as me, and how wrong I am to assume that is the case. Simply written and an easy read. A good book, light-hearted, but not one that I couldn't want to see what the next page said."
4,Interesting Quick read.,"Read this book. Read it for the only reason of reading a book written from a perspective that you have never read before. It gets to the point that you can almost sense what it is like to be autistic and what thought process one with autism may have. I don't even pretend that I ""know"" what is like to be that way, but after reading this I ""may"" have a closer idea.The book has a very quick pace and once you pick it up you may not put it down until you realize you are already on the last page.Some may say that the story is a bit anti-climatic, but I think it fits very well to the character who is telling this tale.I have recommend this book to my friends and the enjoyed it."
4,Accurate but Slow,"Mark Haddon totally understands autism in children. I thought I was reading a novel written by a mother who had an autistic child. It's a very quick read and you just don't want to put it down because it's shocking how he thinks. I found myself getting on and off the tubes thinking how would he do this--what would he count--were there any red cars in a line--this shows that the author rounded the character in a way that sticks in the reader's mind. Worth a read if passing time on a plane, train, bus, or rainy day."
5,Fascinating read,"I generally don't finish books in just a few days, but I was totally engrossed in this book from the very first lines... I simply couldn't put it down! Intriguing. Funny. Quirky. Christopher is a beautiful character that you can't help but fall in love with. Brilliantly written."
5,Awesome book.,Loved this book. The voice. The perfection of details. The mystery. The real characters and their endearing foibles. Loved this book.
4,Curious book,"This book provided an interesting view point that most of us don't consider. The story line was unique as well. In my professional life I've worked with many individual with autism, and I could relate bits and pieces of the main character to real life people. If this book were any longer I may of had trouble sustaining my attention, because I enjoy a book that flows and paints a picture without a lot of reasoning and explanation."
3,deja vu?,"This book was very highly recommended to me by an avid book reader whose opinion I trust. I enjoyed the book; it was interesting to peer into the mind of an autistic boy and it held my attention. However, I wish I hadn't readExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close: A Novelby Jonathan Safran Foer beforehand, because this one felt a little too similar. ""A Curious Incident"" is narrated by a fifteen-year-old austic boy who, we learn, has lost his mother, and sets out to investigate the death of his neighbor's dog. ""Extremely Loud"" is narrated by a nine-year-old boy who lost his father in the 9/11 attacks and sets out on an investigation of his own pertaining to a certain key, and while not autistic, has certain traits and characteristics not unlike Haddon's narrator.All that to say that had I read ""The Curious Incident"" first, I would have appreciated it an awful lot more and likely would have hailed it as brilliant."
2,Modern Literature Is Rubbish,"This book is not original. It is not particularily moving. It is not innovative, and it is most certainly not thought-provoking. The New York Time's glowing review compares it to ""The Sound and the Fury,"" but where Faulkner's masterpiece uses mental disability to comment on the Southern lifestyle and the human condition, Haddon's novel merely declares the typical message that ""being autistic is tough, but in the end things can turn out okay."" When I finished this book, I didn't have to sit and think about it; it had little more heft than a typical Mitch Albom story. In addition to its thematic mundanity, ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"" overuses its quirky devices, contradicts its narrative style, ruins the plot of ""The Hound of the Baskerviles,"" and inaccurately explains the Monty Hall Problem. Literature is all but dead, and praise of books like this is dragging it even further away from redemption."
3,The easy way to get a sense for autism,"The Curious Incident is nice in that it's a different style, but because the story is told through the eyes of an autistic child, the writing is necessarily bland, random, and matter-of-fact. This can make it rather dull at times, but Haddon does a nice job of conveying other characters' emotions despite this. It's also a nice quick read, so you're not investing that much time in it."
3,Well ....,"This book, to me, was a mixed bag. It was somewhat interesting, somewhat tedious and somewhat entertaining. However, I haven't given it another thought since I finished it. Not a good sign for me. But, maybe that's just me and you'll enjoy it more. It is still worth buying, just not one of my favorites."
4,A Pleasantly Quirky and Quick Read,"This was an extremely quick read (1 afternoon), but a very satisfying one. The story is told through the eyes of Christopher Boone, an adolescent savant boy who is great at his ""maths,"" but sorely lacking in social maturity. I loved the way that Mark Haddon captured Christopher's voice perfectly. So, too, did he capture the essence of the love/frustration/despair that Christopher's separated parents have dealing with their son. An interesting little novel. Probably not for those who like action-packed adventures, but very thoughtfully and imaginatively done."
3,Review,This story is about a boy who has a disability deals with strangers and his family. A boy whose name is Christoher is Asperger and he is little defferent from other people but I didn't realized his syndrome though. It was difficult for me to read and understand whole story . I recommend to read this novel advantage readers.
4,"funny, interesting, sad","A great book! So funny, so eye-opening...so entertaining and fascinating! I won't go on repeating what the other reviewers have already said.The only thing that disappointed me was the family Christopher had to learn his values from. How much he could've done with some knowledge about moral and religious truth - now he excludes it all with few very poor arguments when otherwise he's so smart. If his parents hadn't been examples of extreme selfishness this guy would've made miracles."
3,interesting book,the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is kind of murder mysteryyou can know from this book about who is murder and what is autisticIt is interesting but sometimes hard to understand such as science and math partIf you have a time to read I recommend this book
4,Touching and inspirational,"Haddon does a superb job of capturing the idiosyncrasies of the autistic, and has combined all of these to create a truly believable character in Christopher. This story is incredibly moving and really makes you both love Christopher and sympathize with his way of viewing the world. From his need to mathematically analyze things, to his hatred of the color yellow, Christopher offers a different, but extremely logical way of looking at the world that makes one stop and say to themselves: ""why didn't I think of it that way."""
4,I liked it,I bought this book for school and I gotta say it was very interesting. I was hooked through the whole.book. Learned alot about a disability I didn't even know about
4,8th grader's perspective,"the book is interesting and fun. it's amusing to read about what the ""special- main charcter"" is thinking. there are doubts in the book of what will happen, but the conclusion is better than what you expect. it's a great book it's nice and readable."
3,eh...it wasn't all that.,"It took me a while to get into this book due to the nature of the narrative, but after I got used to it, it was entertaining. What I didn't actually like, was the story itself. It started out with great promise and ended somewhat disappointingly. I wish the author would have stayed a little more focused with Christopher and not his divorced parents. Now I realize that this was part of the story, but I lost interest because there really wasn't anything new said, except of course, who said it."
4,Dog gone good book,"This book was an excellent book to read about a person who has autism. This book shows what its like for him in life and what he is thinking about. I liked this book because it was very different then anything that I have ever read and it has a superb plot. The main character goes to a ""special"" school and is very good in mathematics, and wants to take a level A math class. He is also trying to figure out who murdered the dog, Wellington. It has many different twists in it and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Also, it is easy reading. While the illustrations shorten the book, they also add to what is going on in Christopher's head and what he sees. All in all, I think that this book was an excellent one, to read and I would recommend it to anyone especially if you are working with autistic children."
4,Seek The Genius In You,"I was prompted to read this by my pal, Barbara Heizer, who resides in NYC. I asked her to recommend a book for me when she happened to mention a blurb in the NY TIMES about this particular book. Think it might be a fun read I bought it via amazon.com. I read it while on a train going from Tokyo to Takayama, Japan. The star of the book is a young boy who is immediately admired. He is looked upon as a misfit, but in reality he is a genius. He makes total sense. It's everyone else that needs work. What a wonderful story. It also reminded me of one of my favorite high school books called FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON."
4,Fresh and surprising,"Unlike some of the recent novels I have read, this book does not rely on sentimental journeys into the past: the 1960's or the 1970's. The prose is crisp and the descriptions are specific. Working in mental health, I was pleased to see that the narrator's likes, dislikes and behaviours were not overly explained and were treated more as eccentricities. The story was acutely respectful without seeming 'politically correct'. The fact that the narrator may or may not be autistic was not the key factor to the novel and that made it all the more refreshing. Basically - it was a good story, well written and unique. I would recommend it to everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,An interesting look from a different point of view,The look inside the mind of an autistic teenager and how he reacts to the world around him as well as a realistic approach to the ways others react to that character makes for a fascinating and fun read.I read this while on vacation and highly recommend it as something you can easily escape for a few hours. Excellent for reading while traveling.
4,Perceptive and thought provoking,"I read an interview with the author where he said that this book was mainly about how badly we communicate with each other. Certainly, this story written from the viewpoint of a boy with Asperger's makes you think about how differently minds work and the barriers this makes for communication."
5,Book Order,Thanks for the quick delivery. The book was better than stated. I will definitely recommend.
3,Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"This book was very cleverly written. The writer goes off in tangets (which is in keeping with the book), but was a little frustrating to me. Overall, although its not my usual type of book, it was a reasonable read and very well written."
4,Nice and Easy,"Well, I had to read this for a final in AP PSYCHOLOGY. I would have to say I liked it because it was an easy read and definitely not a traditional novel. A great story really about a curious boy."
4,Very Insightful,"It is not often that you read something that is actually original, and interesting. This was definitiely both. I loved the structure, the prose, and the themes, which were woven together into one of the more interesting narratives I had read in years.Worth a read for sure."
4,"This ""Dog"" Will Be Your Best Friend","A funny and smart book, ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"" will have you laugh out loud, but will also break your heart for the main character. I truly enjoyed the way Mr. Haddon would set up scenes, putting the reader right there with the character. I hope I get to be even close to the caliber that he displays with this book. A definite must-read!"
3,Prime numbers,"This is a moving and humorous short novel about an autistic teenager's attempt to discover the murderer of a neighbor's dog, and ultimately to navigate the minefield of his parents' broken marriage. The text is riddled with colorful diagrams, photos, and equations that demonstrate various points the narrator is trying to make; because he sees the world in a very literal way, he finds this technique easier than ""putting pictures in people's heads"" with words or using metaphors (which he calls ""lies""). Rather than detracting from the story, these ""extras"" help put us in the narrator's very objective and unemotional mindset. The chapters are titled with prime numbers--i.e., those numbers divisible only by themselves and 1--a fitting *metaphor* for the very solitary-minded narrator of this book."
4,Waiting for his next...,"I am always overly sentimental about books set in England because I lived there for many years myself. I love the little nuances that I 'get' that maybe someone who's never lived there wouldn't pick up on. Haddon not only gave me the gift of a English local but a great story as well. It has a quick, easy and fairly light feeling considering the issues raised. But most importantly I think a light has been placed upon someone with autism in a more flattering direction. It doesn't have to be all Dustin Hoffman RainMan all over again. We take this journey with Christopher and learn how bewildering things can be through his eyes. Yet, being a teenager is bewildering on its own and we all can relate to that."
5,Loved it!,"This is a terrific book. The main character is one of the quirkiest you'll encounter, however you come to identify with him and cheer him on. His autistic world view starts to make more sense than the normal world view of those people around him. Plus there are diagrams, and he explains the ""Let's Make A Deal"" door selection dilemma so I finally got it! What more could you want in a book?"
4,A Wonderfully Imaginative Book,"I really liked this book on tape. I learned a lot about autisim in a compelling, entertaining, very intimate way. I have recommended it to many friends who have autistic children, and to those children as well. It's a strong clear voice for people maybe too shy or too walled off emotionally to be able to express or want to express their feelings for themselves."
4,Great Book,"great book. i really loved how Haddon made this book from Christopher's point of view. This book had made me look at children with ""Special Needs"" a lot differently"
3,New Perspective,"The book gave a great new perspective to what it is like to have a personality disorder, since the book is written in the point of view from a child that is presumed to have Asperger's syndrome. However, it did not have a great finish to it, which is why I only gave it 3 stars."
5,Facinating Narrative from Austistic Perspective,"Christopher Boone is the autistic protagonist of this book. Christopher likes routine, mathematics, dogs, and Sherlock Holmes novels. When his neighbor's dog is murdered, and he is incorrectly suspected as the killer, he decides to find out who did it, Sherlock-style, in both solving the mystery and writing it down. This reflexive style is fascinating- I love Christopher's perspective on not understanding facial expressions, idiomatic expressions like ""raining cats and dogs,"" and the way he spends idle time by solving math problems in his head, and actually including said problems in the text. The book even has an appendix to show how he solved a particularly difficult question from an academic test he takes. Christopher also deviates from the story line sometimes, usually in order to make an extended metaphor, and gives you interesting scientific or historical tidbits that were also fun to read. This book is great. I loved it."
3,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time,"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a murder mystery, about a autistic boy named Christopher John Francis Boone. Late one night on one of his many walks he finds his neighbors dog, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. The poliece come and Christopher is forced to go to jail for the night. In jail he promises to himself that he will figure out who killed Wellington. After he starts to investigate people he decides to write a mystery novel. Siobhan, who is a social worker at Christopher's school tells him to write a book about everything he knows about the murder.I thought it was a slow read in the beginning, it turned out to be a great novel at the end. But overall I would recommend, this book to anyone."
3,At last the three-door puzzled explained...,"The book was good, but the most interesting aspect of it is that it explains in two pages how the famous three-door puzzle works."
3,Just OK....,"I bought this book because it was so popular and reviewed so well...it was a fast read and some parts were entertaining and made you think, but a bit strangely written...it was also highly predictable..."
2,Quirky Book Leaves Plot Wanting,"Dont get me wrong, i liked the book. I mean i didnt looove it, but it was weird enough to hold my attention for the duration. I liked the tiny diagrams and pictures aiding in obscure descriptions. I liked the off beat characters. And I especially liked, maybe loved (but dont push it), the first fifty pages. Nevertheless, I HATED THE ENDING. A book should end with some finality. Nothing less than genocide, nuclear winter or buddha like enlightenment. Perhaps the dog really died of boredom?"
4,How to be a square peg in a round-hole world.,"Mark Haddon's curious book describes in the simplest prose what life is like when seen through the eyes of a 15 year-old autistic boy. The book's protagonist, Christopher, navigates daily life with charts, graphs, logic and truth. Not so strange; until you realize as you read how little ""normal"" people notice the details in the world around them, and how much ""normal"" people lie during the course of a day, week, month, or year.If this book paints an accurate description of life with autism (and there seems to be ample evidence that it does), then I am astounded at the bravery that these individuals exhibit, as square pegs, trying to live their lives in a round-hole world.Christopher employs true creativity and imagination (although as an autistic person he argues that he has neither) to invent ways of coping with a confusing and often terrifying world.Exceptionally well done.C.A.Wulff -"
3,I felt like I was reading a required High school book,It was just a bit slow and a bit to easy of a read for me. I found it hard to relate to the characters as it was a bit extreme. I also found it to be very unrealistic and I don't think that the author put too much thought into how this kids life would REALLY be like or what he would ACTUALLY be thinking. Not a book of my taste.
4,Very different perspective,Book written from the perspective of an autistic teenager. I gave it to my niece who is studying to be a special ed teacher.
2,Great voice--bad book,"I'm still scratching my head over this one. The writing is lovely, and the autistic narrator's voice is fresh, believable, engaging. So why squander such a fully realized voice in a tired minimal plot populated by poorly drawn characters? The father, for instance, is key here, but all the author can think of for him to say is variations on, ""Oh, [fill in expletive], Christopher."" The mother and neighbors are also ciphers....and don't tell me this is because of the narrator's unreliable perceptions. Banal dialogue is banal dialogue whether or not it's being rendered by an unreliable narrator. Basically, this novel is a case of an author putting a huge amount of work into creating one fine character and his unique voice, and then deciding he didn't need to do any work on other parts of the book. And the voice is done so well, it's almost worth reading. Almost."
2,Pathetic ending,"Maybe because I'm Asperger's I don't see why everyone thinks it was so clever to write this from the persepective of an autistic boy. Duh. Has this seriously never been done before? Additionally, after putting so much effort into the rest of the book, I couldn't believe the tacked-on, contrived ending. It seemed like he got three-quarters of the way through and then got stuck and just wanted to finish it up any way he could."
2,Really curious about why everyone else loved it....,"This book was highly recommended but I truly don't understand why. At best it's a quirky read, at worst it's tedious and predictable. Sorry but I just really found it to be a waste of time...."
3,Curiously inconsequential,"It begins well, but a quirky narrative structure is not enough to sustain a book in which the plotline is so hackneyed. Christopher's father is a convincing mix of emotions, but the mother is a patronising sketch (her letters, with their contrived spelling errors, are a real low point), suggesting that as a novelist Mr Haddon still has a long way to go.I am aware that this is written as a children's book, but there are far more accomplished writers for children (e.g. Elizabeth Laird, Anne Fine, Alan Gibbons, Geraldine McCaughrean) who can construct an engrossing narrative with recourse to such gimmicks--as that, sadly, is all that Christopher amounts to in this flimsy setting.A promising idea, disappointingly executed."
4,"Fictional, but good study of what autism looks like.","The title is odd and gives no indication of the book's content. The book was recommended to me and I was pleasantly surprised. It is told from the viewpoint of a child with autism, with him discussing various things that happen in his life. The book offers excellent insight into how an autistic child may think. There is tremendous variety in how children on the autism spectrum present, but the book is an accurate reflection of some things that may be expected from children with this diagnosis."
4,"Entertaining, funny and intellectual!!! A must read!!!","I loved this whole book. Christopher is an absolutely amazing charachter. The way Mark Haddon portrayed him was absolutely marvelous and without a doubt unforgettable. This book explores one boy's life journey. His hopes for the future, his dreams, and this book explores his amazingly imaginative and intelligent mind. It is a must read for all who wish to be entertained, who wish to laugh, and all of those who wish to learn more about the diversity of todays intellectual thinking of the mind. Christopher is truly unique as is this whole book."
5,unique voice,"I've learned a lot from this book. Most people know about autism but rarely one encounters someone suffering from this disorder. Here is a chance to follow an autistic teenager on his brave quest for answers as he leaves his suburban neighborhood,for the first time, for London.Well written(I felt like I was there w/Christopher), this book educates the reader as well as entertains. It's funny, sad and real."
5,EXCELLENT!,"An excellent read for folks who work with autistic children. The main character's view of the world and the events in it seems strange at first, and then completely understandable considering his ""special needs"". This is a quick read, but is also a provacative novel that makes a person think with someone else's mind for a while. I teach middle school English...if it weren't for some of the profanity, I would definitely share this with students, as I think it could be a great tool for teaching acceptance and tolerance of children with autism or Aspbergers."
4,A great fiction!,Need some insight on the autistic mind but want to read fiction vs. medical/psychological text? This is for you. It is a wonderful read with a great insiders view of an autistic boy grappling with some tough issues. Special thanks to Mark Haddon for writing this book!
3,"Competent Writing, Not for Everyone","Many people liked this book, apparently, but personally I did not really enjoy it. Here is why:The book is told from the point of view of an autistic adolecent. As such, I found the plot to be predictable and simplistic. I realize that the whole point of the book is to allow the reader to see the world from an unusual autistic point of view, however I found an entire book told from this perspective to be a bit too much for my taste.I can see why some people would find this book interesting, but it simply did not work for me. Nevertheless, the book is competently written and the concept of an autistic narrator is original.Bottom line: the book is OK but it's no masterpiece."
5,Interesting,"It was hard to put the book down. So interesting. I loved taking a peek inside such a brilliant, troubled mind."
4,Fascinating!,"Absolutely fascinating to see the world from the point of view of an autistic boy. This book has made me understand in a much clearer way the way our world can look - threatening, confusing, overloaded! It pulls on your heart when you, the reader, understands the situation and our protagonist does not."
2,I just didn't like it,"I finally decided to purchase this book after all the great reviews i read. Sadly, I was left disappointed after reading the final page. This was not a great book, at best it was an interesting story with a few gems of knowledge. Overall, I give this book 2 Amazon Stars."
2,Major disappointment,"Okay, am I the only person who disliked this book? Yes, I understand the ""perspective"" but I found it boring and tedious as heck. Quite frankly, I didn't want nor need to know how Christopher solved all the Maths. It was a major disappointment - thank heaven, it was short!"
2,WHAT'S THE POINT?,"SLIGHTLY INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE FROM A YOUNG BOY'S VIEW, BUT AT THE END I WAS LEFT FEELING THAT I'D WASTED 2 DAYS OF FREE-TIME & AM STILL WONDERING WHY THIS WAS GIVING SUCH HIGH REVIEWS..."
1,Don't believe the Hype,"This book STUNK. I will have to admit, that the writer did an amazing job depicting life from the point of view of an autistic child. that is the only reason that I kept reading after the first 3 pages. It was sadly predictable from the opening lines, where you could guess everything that was going to happen. Essentially, don't waste your time unless you are interested in living with autism. Wait a minute, strike that. Go read Faulker."
2,It's politically correct to like this book,"I read about a novel a week, so I of course read this book. I did not see what all the excitement was about. It is one of those books we are supposed to like because it is about an autistic person, or writen by an African-American, or about homosexuals. There are many good books in these genres, but this I feel is not one of them. But we are supposed to like it because it is about an autistic person and if we didn't like it we would then be looked upon as being narrow-minded and small. A spade is a spade in my book regardless of what it is about."
2,A book for Adults not for Children or Autistic Children,"I did not like this book due to its' content and plot.This book is not appropriate reading for grade school children, or to Autistic children by their teacher. Inappropriate language used.Unfortunatly an Autistic child cannot always seperate the real life situation from a fictional story situation presented in this book.This book can make it worse for a family dealing with their Autistic child. This book is Adult reading."
1,Toxic,"A few pages in and I've already noticed a series of errors:The protagonist has no trouble understanding symbolic representations of faces and matching them to real faces, has an excellent memory, yet needs to carry around a cheat sheet of face symbols.Actually it's very easy to tell if a large number is prime or not. The only difficulty lies in factoring large numbers. Someone who cared about such things would know this.The paragraph and sentence lengths do not follow a Gaussian distribution.This book is like a big unwanted patronizing hug. It makes me feel sick."
1,Ignore others..,"This book was horrible, unless you enjoy reading something which sounds like an eight year-old wrote it. The story is flat, and seems to go nowhere. The worst was the vocabulary [or lack thereof], which, although appropriate to the narrator's mindset, is almost painful to sit through. I persisted only because I had some bleak hope that the ending might be what everyone loved about the book, but I was disappointed in that as well."
3,Ugh!,"I hated reading this book and hated the kid narrating the story. In fact, I found myself wishing the kid would get killed.With that said, I had trouble putting it down. As an aspiring author myself, this tells me Mark Haddon did his job. He got me emotionally attached to the main character."
1,years on I still cringe when I see this cover,"Don't read this if you have an autistic child. Amazon, stop ""recommending"" it to me, for the love of Pete."
2,F-Bomb what?,"This story about an autistic teenage boy on its own is quite a good story, though it is quite short. I read it in about six hours.The main reason I did not like the book was because it felt like the author had to drop the F-bomb cuss word every page and it just ruined the story. Maybe once would be acceptable. But in every conversation? Not everyone in the world uses that language, as the story seems to portray.By the end of the book, I was left wondering if I got the right book. I didn't understand what the hype was all about.I would not recommend this book to anyone that does not like a lot of profanity in their reading, like me."
2,Artistic? More like Autistic...,"While in college, I also worked with children with Autistism. This review is by no means intended to offend the Autistic community. I understand what the author is trying to accomplish with this book (to obviously be unique in a competative world of thousands of writers), but this is not what I define art and literature to be. The story on its own could definitely be beautiful, but why fill it with rubbish (i.e., pages and pages of drawings, maps, math equations, etc.) to try to be different? In my opinion, it's easier to write like Haddon does- it's more difficult to write with a subtle beauty. Most importantly, great art can withstand time. Do you honestly think this pop-novel will be read a hundred years from now?"
2,"Interesting topic, but not the most satisfying read","It seems like a novel that's popular because of its strange narrative style and its large number of random facts. Although its interesting to see the potential perspective of an autistic child, it's painful to see how much discomfort he causes to his parents, and from his point of view he isn't seeing their discomfort and trying to amend the situation. It's very difficult to enjoy a novel that's narrated through the eyes of child who is, though understandably so, a selfish person. The author seeks to lower this discomfort by riddling it with so many random facts and pictures, things that serve to make the narrator more amiable. The author tries to make a small adventure look paramount, and it doesn't convince me. A cute book, but not that great."
2,"Yawn, and Double Yawn","What a lot of hype for a dreadfully boring book. I have never skipped over so much of a novel in an attempt to get to the ""good part."" The illustrated maps and maths were tedious and the endless, prattling off-plot narration drove me nearly to distraction. If you are lured by the gushing, good reviews of this book, do yourself a favor and check it out from your library before cracking open your wallet."
2,"Different, but painful to read","I have to admit that the book is very different. The funny illustrations throughout the book, and the story being told by an autistic boy. I was intrigued as to who killed the dog, but the answer was given away so quickly in the book. After a few chapters, I find the endless mathematical problems, and the run-on sentences irritating. I find myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the interesting part. I understand that what Christopher did is triamphant to autistic patients everywhere, but I really could care less. Some intersting storylines, but oversall there's really nothing to the book."
2,I don't get it!!!!!,"I honestly don't get what all the hoopla is about this book. I read the entire book because I kept thinking it would get better; it didn't. The book wasn't that boring, it was okay. But I kept asking myself over and over ""Who cares?"" I just don't understand how the book got to be a ""national best seller."""
2,Give it a miss,"I love when there is much buzz about a book and people say they love it. That is how I stumbled upon such treasures as ""She's Come Undone"", ""In Her Shoes"", ""Running with Scissors"" and ""I Know This Much is true"". So I have got to say I am really dissapointed about this book. I bought it this morning as a companion for a hot lazy day at the pool. I am about 100 pages in and there is no point, no story - I do not even feel for the character. All is all a big snooze fest. Give it a miss."
2,A Pointless Read,"I thought the angle the author took (writing from the point of view of a young autistic child) was about the only interesting thing I can say for the book. It was very slow and the author threw in so many haphazard facts that were both confusing and somewhat pointless, that by the time I finished the book, I wondered what was the point? I don't know, I expected it to be much better and it was just okay."
3,Interesting perspective but pedestrian plot,"I wish I had more appreciation for the writing in this novel but other than the unique idea of an autistic first person narrator, it's pretty dull going. I tired very early of the scientific preaching and eventually was disappointed by the unimaginative plot. The ending is a non-event. It resolves nothing but by that time, I no longer cared what happened to any of the characters. 3 stars for a unique approach."
5,Curious Mind,"A great peek into the mind of an autistic boy. A simply told tale that keeps you wanting to turn the page. Mark Haddon has created a character that readers will want to hold close to them, but of course you can't."
4,An interesting read.,"The book is written in a semi-diarist style. The supposed author of the book is a very high-functioning 15 year-old autistic child. We follow him as he tries to find out who killed the neighbours dog. Our hero has an incredible memory for detail, but is unable to empathize or step back from these details and thus handicaps him in daily living. There were some minor inconsistencies in style to enable the story move forward a bit quicker and I thought that the author wrote himself into a corner (to create some suspense) at one point that he did not get out of too convincingly.If you liked this story I would suggest reading Flowers for Algernon."
5,Extraordinary perspective on life,"Some books open your eyes to new worlds. They expand your understanding of what's possible, and in so doing, teach you something about yourself. This is such a book.Forget that high-falutin' talk, though. This book is a funny page-turner that will keep your interest page after page. It reads fast, perfect for taking on a plane ride. That's where I read it, after picking it up at an airport bookstore, and I arrived at my destination before I knew it."
5,Great book!,"I thought this book might be a bit cheesy but went for it anyways. It was great! An easy one day read for those of you who can't put a book down and let me tell you, this is one of them!"
4,A very unconventional book,"When I was reading the first pages of The curious incident ... , I noticed that this was definitely no book for everybody. Especially the flat and emotionless style, takes some time, to get familliar with it. ASlos the lack of suspense and variation in writing, makes this novel hard to read. But if you like profound literature and if you're willing to invest time on thinking about it, the book afford's a intressting insight in the world of an authistic, called Christopher. A 15 year old boy Christopher, who suffers from Aspergers syndrome, decides to write a murder-mystery-novel about the death of a dog in his neighbourhood. In course of his investigations for his book, other mysteries and problems begin to come up - which turns out to be a real challenge for authistics like Christopher. To sum it up a very moving book, but a matter of taste."
3,Wasnt too bad,This book was about a boy named christopher who has autism. He finds a dog dead (Wellington) and its a mystery to find out who did it. He finds out a lot about how his Dad lies to him about pretty important things from the past. He learns a lot on his journies and all the trouble he goes through to find out who did it because when he likes something then he really cares and it becomes very important to him. He relates a lot to what he feels and becomes really dedicated to what he wants to find out and help Mrs.Shears with the loss of her dog. He is a very caring person and the book has a lot of twisting turns and events that you wouldnt expect to happen. The reason why i didnt find it very entertaining for myself was because it didnt have chapters or anything and the format was different and for a person that likes reading a little bit it was hard to get attached to the book.
5,"Unique, Truthful, Thrilling, and Much More Than Wonderful!","YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY READ THIS BOOK!!!This book is about a boy named Christopher. Christopher, on top of being a teen, and not having a mother, has autism, a spectrum disorder. When Wellington, a neighbor's dog is murdered with a garden fork, Christopher is determined to catch the dog's killer. The chapters are numbered using only prime numbers, because it is told by Christopher, and Christopher likes prime numbers. Between the tale of the murder mystery, Christopher lets you in on what it is like to have autism, and how you just can't really trust people. I can relate a lot to Christopher's point of view, despite that fact he has autism and I don't!Haddon is a great author, and deserves some sort of award. He is really great!This story has seventy-trillion ways you can look at it, and you have to love it, no matter which way you choose. In fact, this book deserves a million stars, not just five!"
3,Disappointed,"I've heard rave reviews about this book but I was not impressed. I think the first half the book is great and wish it had continued in the same fashion. I think it definatly was written from a unique perspective and the story intrigued me.....for the first 100 pages. The direction of the book changed completly. It started as a carefree, amusing glimpse into the life of a 15 year old boy with Aspersers who's trying to solve a mystery. It ended up not really being a mystery at all and more about the dynamics of his family. I thought it ended rather depressing. I don't see how this book was written for children! I'd recommend it if you feel like reading something different."
2,Not a fair picture,"For many, this book may be the only encounter they have with autistic children. Please do not think that Haddon painted a true autistic character. His research and understanding is lacking. Good book, but the main character does not represent most autistics."
2,"Started strong, died quickly","A lot of the reviews here seem to confuse the ability to portray the life of an autistic with the ability to write a compelling novel. I appreciate the skill it took to do the former, but the _story_ itself is weak. Without giving too much away, your average reader should figure the plot out pretty quickly, and the novel becomes a drag soon afterword."
4,Thanks Mark Haddon.,"To those who are constantly trying to understand autism, this book is a gift. Communicating with an autistic (child or adult) is a constant challange. Of course all autistic people are different, as are the rest of us, so it is a mistake to think that Christopher is stereotypical.The stress of raising an autistic child is dealt with very well. This disability must be among the most difficult for families to cope with. I would have appreciated an additional character: a non autistic sibling .I wonder how the book plays with readers who have never encountered autism. ."
5,Very well done!,"I think that what determines if a person likes a thing or not is if they see a reflection of themselves in it. Thoughtful or autistic people would probably enjoy this book very much, because they can identify with Christopher and learn something about their own life from the things that happen in his.But people who have difficulty or impatience understanding autism might not enjoy this book very much. Probably would keep being frustrated.This is a very good and rich story that I'm grateful for having read. I even bought the audiobook to listen to on trips - it's also wonderfully done. Pick yourself up a copy and enjoy."
4,Haddon is a genius,Short story and actually rather simple. But it isn't the plot that keeps you reading this in one go. It is the perspective. Haddon presents us the observations and thinking of an autistic 15 year old. Love it!
5,Fascinating attention-grabber,"This book is a very easy read, as well as an emotional and mental thrill ride as the reader is taken into Christopher's autistic world."
4,"I cried, not once, not twice, but three times...","I was appaulled to hear that advocacy groups for Autism were condemning this book - the first thing you pick up when dealing with Autism or Aspergers is that no two individuals are alike. Some of them have behaviours that are completely opposite. Is this book an accurate portrayal of this affliction, I don't know, I'm not autistic. What I can say however, is that in my years of working with autistic children, this is the sort of impression I received from them. Keep in mind that this book is fiction and not a thesis - and as a work of fiction it is absolutely spectacular. As my title infers, I cried three times and I'm not much for crying. Give the book a read and let the activists go hoarse with their condemning chants."
5,Couldn't put it down...,"This book was recommended to me by a Special Education teacher. At first glance, I thought the premise seemed contrived, however once I began reading the book I was hooked. In fact it was so compelling that one day I sat in my car during my lunch break to be able to read in peace during summer weather in Texas.Haddon does a great job at showing us the struggle Christopher goes through to gain insight into the situation around him, while at the same time trying very hard to stay within the limits he has set for himself to keep his world orderly.This is a very well rounded story in all regards. The characters are expertly developed and the plot is excellent. The book is well written, with many creative touches.This is a wonderful book for high schoolers, teachers or parents to gain an understanding of what *might* be going on in the heads of special needs children."
3,Great Game. On-line? Where is everyone?,"This is a really great game for what it is. Reviewers on the XBox and PS2 pages for this are right on with most of their reviews so I won't repeat. In short, this is Diablo with less dark plot, more spiffy powers, and choices. In general this is definately a worthy purchase for anyone and I like the PC version because of the two bonus characters. However one of my biggest reasons for buying this was to play online (in a similar style to Diablo) however I don't think I've ever seen anyone logged on. Its even free to play online! In general the story is solid, the graphics are passable, and its definately a fun way to blow your free time. If you're looking for the next great award winning master piece though, don't look here."
5,One of the few good super heroe games,"Great game! I bought it about a week ago, and I can't get enough of it!The game biggest pro is the huge amount of action.Good Graphics (at least for the moment it came up)Gameplay is smooth. I had some trouble getting used to the controls. My recomendation is not to use the mouse at all. With just keyboard the controls are at least playable. However, possibly having a game pad with 10 buttons plus D-Pad could help.Voice acting is not so great but does the job."
4,Good adaptations,"Back 25 or so years ago when I bought this book, it was among the first Star Trek books I ever got. Perhaps the first one. As an adaptation of the original Star Trek episodes ""Arena"", ""A Taste of Armageddon"", ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"", ""Errand of Mercy"", ""Court Martial"", ""Operation - Annihilate!"", ""The City on the Edge of Forever"", and ""Space Seed"", it contains some of the most powerful Star Trek stories. Blish did a good job of adaptation. I must've read this and the rest of the series umpty zillion times before switching to something else. I ended up getting all twelve books plus ""Mudd's Women"". Good stuff."
5,Excellent 'How to Guide',"This book is an excellent Oracle how to guide. It is quick and to the point on several DBA topics. It keeps the theory to a minimum so as to be concise as possible. It is an excellent resource for a junior DBA.I use this book a companion to my other Oracle books, and keep a copy within easy reach."
5,What A Great Prog-Rock CD!!!,"So I saw 33DEGREE open up for Disturbed back in 06, and they blew my mind! I almost wanted to see more of 33DEGREE, and less of Disturbed! I was shocked to see a beautiful female singer screaming her heart out while 3 boys rocked behind her! I hear they're from LA, and still together, but haven't seen or heard any new updates from them. Can't wait to see where this band is headed in the future!"
5,I have used this book over a month and I like it.,"With help ""INDEX"" I can find necessary commandand small example about it in few seconds.There is so much information on those 371 pages:data types, operators, all functions with short examples,admin utils and common administration tasks (backup, restore, users, rights),server-side programming overview (PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, PL/Perl),client-side programming overview (Perl,Python, PHP, ODBC, ...),complete SQL command reference etc.Lots of small examples.If you need instruction how to use syslog for logging? Log rotating?You find the answer very quickly.Short, but interesting overview - PostgreSQL versus other RDBMs.It's a small book, but there is a lot of good information inside :)I use this book in my work and I recomend it.Excelent PostgreSQL reference. Professional work."
4,= * * * *,"This is a reference book. As of mid 2002, I do not see any other book which is comparable. This is not a book for teaching SQL or relational databases. This is a book which explains the aspects of PostgreSQL which are distinct to PostgreSQL, and gives brief detailed descriptions of the interfaces presented to users and developers working with PostgreSQL.For what it is, I think this book is pretty good. It would agree that it is a relatively thin layer on top of the PostgreSQL documentation; it does not have nearly the supplementary information that I would expect from, say, an O'Reilly ""PostgreSQL in a nutshell"", but alas there is no such book yet (Practical PostgreSQL is good but not comparable)."
3,A reference - not a HOWTO,"To help me setup an accounting system on a PostgreSQL database, I purchased two books: I found that PostgreSQL Essential Reference answered 10% of my questions, and Beginning Databases with PostgreSQL answered 90% of my questions. PostgreSQL Essential Reference is like the title says, a reference."
5,The title say it all,"The title say it all.This is a Great Essential Reference to PostgreSQL and I recommend it as a Must book to all PostgreSQL user.Each page has its own gems like how to tune the server, Create functions and more.Every Quick browse I learn something, And I like it :)"
1,Sum profreading mite be a good idea...,"As an experienced programmer learning postgresQL, I have not been at all impressed by the number of typos in this book, averaging at least one on each of the pages I have looked at in detail (at least the ones that are not just a virtual cut-and-paste of the online documentation), e.g:eg. pg 245 - should be two single quote characters with raise notice, not one double quotepg 246 - should be returns not returnpg 247 - need an extra end if with the else if, or to use elsif... etc.All seemingly trivial, but could waste lots of time for a novice programmer without ready access to the online documentation. The online documentation at postgresql.com is free and to me seems clear and largely free of typos. It seems to be a book one pays for needs to improve on this to be worth the money, whereas the mistakes in this book make it actually worse. Shame, as they may have crept in at the publishing stage and not be the author's fault."
3,Good reference,This is a good bare bones reference. When I received the book I was hoping it would help me with a few connection issues but I could not find them here. I still had to go to the net and search for quite a few hours. I'm glad that I have this book for command references.
3,Good Intro,"I have no previous Postgres experience, but the book did allow me to accomplish what I needed to do. I believe this will make a good reference book, as the title states, but has to be lacking on more advanced issue. So all in all I would recommend this to a new or novice postgres user."
2,Poor treatment of a great subject,"Having been privileged to know many of the sailors and aviators of USS Gambier Bay, it's lamentable that their story was not better told. Edwin Hoyt was simply out of his depth, riddling the text with numerous errors such as ""50 millimeter machine guns."" Lacking knowledgable editing, the book went to press without a firm basis in its core subject: naval aviation.Fortunately, many of the CVE-73/VC-10 team related their personal stories to the author, who recorded sagas that otherwise might have been lost. But for a far, far better treatment of Gambier Bay and the Battle Off Samar, look no farther than James Hornfischer's superb ""Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors."""
1,Very Dissapointed,"I bought the ring and it is lovely, but it does not close. I put small things in it and they fall out, and if you wear it the box opens.Absolutely not worth the money I spent."
4,"Solid, straightforward advice","In this book, Card provides straightforward, down-to-earth advice on characterization and choosing a point of view for your story/novel. If you want psychobabble, look elsewhere. This book will give both novice and more advanced writers (of all genres) a solid understanding of characer and viewpoint."
4,Not exactly to the point,"'Characters and Viewpoint' is just bristling with examples of craft from a gifted and versatile writer. But you will not find any principles in a capsule form that would allow easy portability into one's own craft. For that, consider Margaret Lucke's guide: 'Writing Great Short Stories'. If you are just trying to polish your act, then 'Characters and Viewpoint' has much to offer."
3,dated,"When this book came out, it was one of the few to go beyond the basics and to do it in a clear, useable way. Today, a number of books have gone beyond this book on the problem of characterization, so the book is dated. And since the book is very brief, it is not as in-depth as the title makes it appear.The discussion of point of view follows the all-too-familiar pattern of listing the possibilities and discussing each one. First person and third person are the two main categories, with omniscient, limited omniscient, and shifting as subheads. Only a few words about the advantages of each and these are the same found in most introductory books on fiction writing. You want to use the most effective point of view, so you'll need to get another book to tell you which those are and to show you why. Still, if you've read only an introductory book on fiction writing, this might be a good next step."
5,"Insightful and extremely practical, engaging written","For years I've been convinced that writing could not be taught, that I would need to simply struggle, incrementally improving my writing. Still, having enjoyed novel after novel of Card's, I bought this book, and had dim hopes of slight improvement. Yet I found myself devouring the piece, realizing exactly where the greatest flaws in my own writing have been and better yet exactly how to fix them. I'm sure I have a long way to go as a writer, but who knew that there was a high speed rail line over such a long stretch of that road? Highly recommended."
4,Characters and Viewpoint,"Orson Scott Card makes informative and lasting insights into the creation of--and following the Point of View of--each character. This is not the STEP A to STEP Z version of writing instructions that make for a clear-cut pattern. Instead, it is a deeper instruction, breaking down the elements of writing that hide from so many want-to-be writers.It is filled with cute little anecdotes and slap-you-in-the-face wake-up calls. ANY writer, no matter how experienced, would benefit from this book. Its an excellent referrence that forces the reader to THINK."
2,Not much on POV,"The book was average. I actually wanted something on POV but Card, although I understand he's a good sci-fi writer, barely touches upon the profound nature of POV which (from a literary POV) can be tricky. The Characters section (most of the book) went over all the obvious stuff. Again, there was no in-depth examination of fictional characters, and nothing above and beyond the rudimentary steps and formula to creating a character. Then again, after reading several other how-to write books, maybe I was expecting too much."
3,The Pete of despair,"I gave the book to my sister Danit to read, and here's what she thought about it:""I think the book is ok because I learned something. But I do hate Nora and Pete very much. He only had to choose different names every time so as not to make them so loathsome."""
5,A good one for beginners,Previous reviewers have pretty much said it all and I will not rehash it here except to say: The book is useful for people in the beginner to intermediate level. Plus isn't it nice to finally see one of these how-to books by a writer you've actually heard of? Do you see my point?
4,Characters and Viewpoint,"Really excellent book gave me three questions to answer, to avoid having the reader throw my book against the wall:1. So what?2. Oh yeah?3. Huh?Orson Scott Card takes a very personal, story-telling approach to instructing us in writing better characters. His anecdotes are humorous and get the point across.I do wish he'd spent a bit more time discussing viewpoint and especially issues surrounding changing viewpoint, but what he does give us is some excellent advice. I highly recommend this book to anyone who writes fiction."
3,"Okay, but frustrating at times","I did like it, but I was frustrated that so many of his examples for characters were from television and movies. It's easy to use those as examples - no one had to write the description or emotion - someone acted it! He did it a lot, from talking about tension and sorrow and jeopardy - all had movie examples rather than literary ones.There has to be a better book out there on this subject."
5,Excellent,"Awesome book. Very detailed and extensive. Seems like a simple thing but rather than using quotes from other books to demonstrate a concept, he's written his own. This really helps to make the point. Most other books I've read on writing quote from example fiction novels. The problem is that they'll quote one book for a good example of a concept and from another source for a bad example. Its comparing apples to oranges and makes it hard to really get the point. Orson Scott Card does an awesome job with his examples and delves into really satisfying depth with all the subjects he's covered. Its the first book on writing that I'm inspired to read again."
3,Slow,"I have been reading through this book slowly, but it just doesn't give me enough to get me to just sit down for hours with it. This would be a good book, but it is quite slow at getting out what few facts it does have on it's many pages. Over all it's okay.Still I have found nothing to top Self Editing for Fiction Writers. If you are looking for a book on writing take a look at that!"
3,a gift,"This is a weak gift and I knew it when I bought it. My mom is so nice, she writes that she uses it when they eat outside. I don't have one at my house to rate it's durablility."
1,rebates from Kworld,i think this company (Kworld) is trying to make excuses not to honor their rebate. they claimed i submitted the packing slip instead of the sales receipt but in fact i photocopied my entire submission and i did mail the sales receipt. i replied to their email but haven't heard back from them. i don't think i could patronized this company ever again.
4,Great item at a great price!,"This video capture card received some very good reviews, that and the low price are the reasons why I decided to buy it. I installed it without any problems, captured video from my vcr and camcorder and everything works great, not a single problem with it. I also really like the software that came with it, PowerProducer 2 Gold. I have made several vcd's and the quality is pretty good. I didn't know you could make vcd's with menus and chapters like a dvd. You can change the menu backgrounds and even import your own still pictures to use as backgrounds."
5,Quality,We use this for our video conference application and they are up 24/7. We have about 200 in the field and only had a problem with 1 card so far. This is a great product!
1,Don't buy Kworld products,"Completely a garbage... never made it work, and further more, the service is so bad. My friend told me the same feeling with his Kworld TV card purchase.Again, don't buy Kworld products any more"
1,Need Correct Information,"The product as stated in the description that it was compatible with a Windows Vista running system, but what they failed to mention was that it only ran with a 64 bit system not a 32 bit system. I hae a 32 bit system. A very important piece of information. Not many people run a 64 bit system due to compatibility problems. So I spent two days trying to find out why the card did not run with with my system. I had to contact the manufacturer. Who was very slow to respond."
1,Too SMALL!,"I had this bra in black for the past several years, and although it wasn't very supportive, it was good for when i needed something spaghetti strap. I recently ordered the same size in white and the fit is completely different, in a chest crushing way. Very disappointing as I washed it and packed it and wasn't able to use it on my vacation as I had planned. My advice is to order at least a size up from what you regularly wear unless you are an A cup at maximum."
1,six pack more than 6 of single pack,Do the math. This six pack of 30 pills ea. costs MORE than six individual packs of 30 pills sold here. Just doesn't make any sense. Who in their right mind would buy the six pack when they can buy six seperate boxes FOR LESS? The marketers are stoned on their product...
2,Not up to the expectations for a delta machine.,"I purchased this machine as a replacement for a delta 40-601 which I ran for thousands of hours over 20 years. Since delta no longer makes the 40-601, I opted for the 40-680.The first thing I noticed was the reduction in the quality level of the stand. Second, the scroll saw required the operator to physically push the blade in order to get it started.I finally had the opportunity to need the saw to run for a couple of hours today with the following results. The lower blade holder is out of alignment and will not hold a blade. It kept breaking blades and would not hold the blade resulting in about 20 broken blades in an hour. I will contact Delta in an effort to resolve the issue.I would not recommend this scroll saw to anyone. I have had various Delta table saws, jointers, and planners. This will be the last piece of Delta equipment I ever buy."
2,big let down,"I'm a woodworking hobbyiest, mostly scrollsaw or fret work. I have purchased only Delta tools in the past and will purchase delta tools in the future. In my shop I have seven (7) delta tools, from bandsaw to sanders, and have been please with every one of them until I purchsed the 680 scrollsaw a year ago.I have had nothing but problems from minor to major. The saw has been in a delta service center from mid August until???????? it' now mid Dec. When it ran it was good, not great but good. The problem is it just don't run very long. Just a lemon I suppose, giving delta the benefit of doubt"
3,It's OK.,"The quality of the picture is pretty bad, but that's understandable - it's an old picture being blown up to big proportions. My main problem is the ""YOU TALKIN' TO ME?"" at the bottom. It feels a lot bigger on the picture than it shows on this site. It's just distracting."
5,"Great Knife, Needs Sharpening",This is a wonderful blade with a beautiful leather sheath. I'm a Navy Corpsman and I can't wait to test this baby out in the field with the Marines. The only concern is that the blade is not as sharp as I would like out of the box. Something I will remedy with a wetstone soon enough!
4,kabar USN. knife...,"great knife,didn't want to pay for kydex sheath - which would have made good match,& easier to carry..over all pleased !"
5,Awesome,I love the quality of this knife. I cant say how it will hold up to use because I did not but it for camping but I am happy with my purchase.
3,Not quite what I expected,"If you're expecting a military issue fighting knife, guess again. The USN Mk 2 knife I was issued way back when had a flat (very flat) black oxide finish and raw unfinished leather washer handle. The knife I just bought has some kind of semi-sheen varnsh all over everything, including the handle. There's a really good reason to have a leather washer handle, it is the best gripping surface of any knife I've ever used; especially when everything is slippery with salt water or grease or oil or whatever. Unfortunately the varnish ruins this grip surface. This is not an issue knife, it's a civilianized version of one. Having said that, on the plus side it is American made forged carbon steel, as it should be, and it is the correct design. It's the real thing, not a knockoff. Now I just have to find a way to get the ridiculous varnish off without ruining it."
1,Very disappointing,"I have always been impressed with Bissell and I have a GoVac and love it, but this was extremely disappointing. We've only had this vacuum 5 months and it's already deceased. The power in the motor has completely gone bust and the lint trap inside has fallen out. It could be that they send the reject models to the military posts at a discounted rate, I'm not sure. It was about $10 off the Amazon list price, but it will also make me rethink about buying Bissell again."
3,Not that good,We had this vacuum cleaner about 3 years. It worked fairly well but failed.We replaced it with a Dyson and are very happy with it.
5,A great value,"I jumped on this deal mainly because of the low price since I've been shopping for a vacumm for some time. I had been using a 12-year old bag vacuum and needless to say, it populated the air more than it cleaned the floor. I received this one yesterday and assembled it together in 5 minutes, then tried it. Wow, it sucked up so much stuff from the carpet in a few seconds that I started wnodering if it'd pull all the fiber off the carpet base :). Anyway, I'm impressed. The other vacuums costing 3 digits may be better, but I think this is an excellent value, if not the best.One tip is that the Bissell HEPA filter fits this vacuum, so you can buy this vacuum and the HEPA filter, it actually saves you a few dollars comparing to buying the other $79.99 Bissell HEPA vacuum."
4,D'Nealian practice,"The book is very good practice for learning, just wish it were thicker with more practice pages."
3,Doesn't meet specs.,"I was very interested in this device to remove any errors from outdoor measurements exceeding 25'. After receipt I tried a few measurements indoors and got error messages for anything over about 15'. After checking the battery and discovering it was questionable I replaced it with a new ""Energizer"" and tried it outdoors measuring distancefrom my garage door. I could only manage about 28', any-thing longer gave error 1 messages. Not quite the 60' claimed!Sonin 10075 Laser Target Range Finder"
5,Great Distance Measurer,"After reading reviews on several distance measuring devices, I chose to try this Sonin unit, even though there were several concerns about accuracy. The unit has been well within my need for accurate measures of room dimensions, ceiling heights and even measurements of up to 40 feet. Great time-saving device and beats the standard tape measure."
2,Not Very Accurate,"I was a bit deceived when I saw this. It says ""Laser Target Range Finder"" and would have you beleive it actually uses a laser to measure. It doesn't. It uses ultrasound with a laser sight. Ultrasound is very imprecise. It expands like a cone so at 60 feet your target is several feet across.Read the accuracy on this, 99.5% +/- 1/4"" What that means is at 60 ft. you could get an error of almost 4"". Instead, get a true laser measure, that are now available for under $100. They are accurate to +/- 1/4"" at 100 ft. Do the math. That's almost 16 times as accurate."
2,Disappointing,"If I could do it over again, I'd spend a bit more for a better unit. The ""on-off"" switch is cheap and lacks a solid feel. The beam is too broad and if there is furniture in the room, the unit is likely to mistake the furniture for your intended target. The laser beam is only minimally helpful because the measurement occurs as soon as you press the ""go"" button (by the time you point the laser at exactly what you wish to measure, the measurement has already occurred). There should be a one second delay. The included pouch failed (the vinyl tore) very soon after I began to use it - and there was no abuse.This unit does work, but it has enough shorcomings that I would recommend shopping for a more solid, reliable, better made range finder - even at a higher cost."
1,Sonin 10075 Range Finder,"It can't measure to a tree (no good for yard planning). It can't measure to a person (no good for photography). It can't measure to a stucco or stucco-like surface (no good for interior work).It can ONLY measure to a FLAT (no angles) surface and it MUST be at a 90 degree angle to that surface and it must be in a quiet place (it works, when it does, with reflected-sound).So, if you want to measure to a flat and smooth surface and your dog doesn't bark, then this thing may be for you.I would return it as ""unsatisfactory"" but the item cost vs the postage cost makes me stuck with it."
4,Good value for money,"I bought this for a friend; so I had little time to test it. However, when I tried it, it worked fine. Distance measurements were acceptable for a range finder of this price point. It also came with a carrying case, which is very useful. Overall, this is good value for money for the average user."
1,waste of $,"Not really useful. I have too many keys, and the pouches, etc. are too small for anything else, except my cell phone which gets lost inside the pocket so I can't see it and then forget it's there!"
4,Good for small necessities,"I have a small, messy room. I find it helpful for keys, cards (ID, debit card) and my cell."
5,A study through Song of Solomon,"This book is fantastic. It clearly translates the Song of Solomon in the Bible into easy-to-understand, contemporary principles for healthy sex lives. It is beautiful, lifechanging, and non- threatening."
4,Only if this was a real SACD...,"... I would have given this disc and its content 5 stars. This is not like what Amazon described. It is NOT a hybrid SACD disc, rather it's a gold HDCD 24bit disc.Despite this mistake, I opt to keep the disc due to its excellent content as what I would have expected and also because of its sonic quality.Play this on a good/great stereo system and I believe you'll be awed."
4,Good Sanding Sheets,"These adhesive backed sanding sheets are very easy to use and the quality is great. I use them with a DEWALT D26441 2.4 Amp 1/4 Sheet Palm Grip Sander and they fit perfectly.Pros:---------------+ Convenient, easy to use. Just peel off the adhesive and stick them on your sander.+ Good quality sandpaper, holds up well.Cons:---------------- Expensive compared to standard sandpaper sheets, but you are paying for the convenience."
1,Poor Quality,"We received this item and it was poor quality. It was marked up and had a place on it that was really bad. When I contacted to see if I could get a replacement I was told since I had opened it I couldn't return it. Also they said I should contact the manufacturer for replacement instead of helping out their customer. First of all, the bottom of the package isn't really sealed it just has some sticky stuff on it and you pull it open, so how else can you see what condition it's in. It cost me a lot to have this cheap item shipped as well. I would recommend do not purchase! Poor...Poor...Poor quality!"
1,Resealed and missing many parts,"Package was crisscrossed with shipping tape. It was missing two legs, instructions and the bag of hardware. Even if it had the parts the construction was very light. Of course Amazon took it back for full refund. This is the same quality of product you buy at HF. Spend more or make your own."
4,It Is What IT Is,I use this as a work table for my RIGID Oscillating Sander Station. Perfect size for the application. Not extremely heavy but well constructed material make it solid enough for light to medium duty tools. Adjustable table top is a plus. Be prepaired to drill your own pilot holes to mount the table top to the stand frame.
4,a good instrumental cd.,This is a good cd. The entire album is like instrumental songs from a Phish concert. I recommend this album for any real Phish fan. It contains some great musicianship which any music fan can also appreciate. I am very pleased with this purchase.
2,Curious companion,2 1/2Surprisingly coarse experimental jam interludes recorded in what is ironically their most layered production equals one confusing little album for phanatics who want a little non-committal background groove.
4,Warming up,"This disc is getting all kinds of reviews so I figured id throw in my two cents. Please don't buy this until youve had a chance to listen to some of the samples. This disc is a truly masterful work of art, but you probably wont notice its how special it is until youve had a chance to give it a few spins. The songs are essentially jams often used as brides from one song into another. New fans may not think that the songs can stand on their own, but they definately can. The disc is great, and I look forward to playing it often. If youre fairly new on the scene check out rift."
4,"finally, it's all about the music","It's really refreshing to hear Phish in their element, this album is the perfect thing to really fill the gap left by them not touring. I don't know alot of technical music things to write about it, but the jams just sound like something out of a great dream. One last thing, every true fan should go down and read the review that made a comment about how its all improv. I got a laugh out of it."
2,What the Hell??,"I am a huge phish fan- i have seen multiple shows, I collect tapes, and it is pretty safe to say that they are my all time favorite band. I love it when they experiment--its one of the things i like best about them. However, there is a fine line between experimentation and crap. I enjoy the disc because it is different, but I really wish I hadnt payed 15 bucks for it. My advice would be to stick to trade the tapes, go to the shows, get the other albums, and experience REAL phish. This just isnt worth it."
2,Only for the die hard,This is undoubtedly a difficult album to listen to. The songs almost entirely lack structure or focus and amount to little more than late night meanderings. Recommended for the die hard fan only.
2,I'll have to take their word that this is phish,"I do like phish, but i must admit that i don't like this cd. It's not that i dont like it because it's improvisational, i dont like it because it's (.....) Phish can write a good song when they want to, but there is not a single track with lyrics. It kind of reminded me of live techno music, in that it's the music doesnt change all that quickly, and it's difficult, nay imposible to distinguish one song from another. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible music, but it's not what phish is good at and it's not al that good. If you like slow, jazzy instumental music, try martin medeski & wood. But if you like phish, do them a favor by not buying this album, so as not to encourage them to produce more such musical monstrocities."
2,Not something to write home about,"This disc is not too great. I have a lot of the Phish cd's and ran out today, 11/7, to buy it. I got into the car and out it on, and was not too happy. The cd contains no lyrics, its all like improvisational music, that is somewhat random, and has no real beat. It sounds like a skipping record."
2,not one of phish's best and their worst studio cd ever,"when i bought this cd, i expected it to be just like any other phish cd. i was dead wrong. the only good use for this is to go to sleep to, cause i fell asleep around the third song it was so boring. dont make a foolish mistake and dont buy this cd."
2,GROAN-WORTHY AND TERRIBLE 3.75 OUT OF 10,"Castle of Illusion tries to hide its craptacular gameplay with the looks of a happy-go-lucky platformer starring the famous Mickey Mouse. Unfortunately, when you start to play this game, you'll see why licensed products were so agonizingly bad in this time period. The gameplay is far too simplistic, the gameplay feels broken at times along with the platforming, it is way too cutesy, the levels are very boring and uninspired, the controls don't seem to function properly at times during platforming sequences, the camera is bad at times, and the enemies are flatout stupid. The plot is only something that pisses me off as well. If you want a good licensed Disney game from this time, go buy the far better Aladdin. Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to play something that is actually fun to play."
2,Misleading search results,"This silicone productRed Devil 826 100% Silicone Sealant Clear Architectural Grade 50 Yr.10.1 Oz. Cartridgewas prominantly displayed during a search specifically for ""aquarium sealant"". While it may be a great product, the manufacture directions on the container clearly state that the product is ""NOT RECOMMENDED for use on aquariums"". A little more information in the product description about usage caveats would have helped me avoid a useless, time consuming purchase. For what it's worth, the extra cost next day shipping was flawless. I received the product as promised he following afternoon."
1,Be aware of an Amazon switcharoo when ordering,When you attempt to order this and click on the Texas Troubadoors by Capital Records as published in 2005 you get switched by Amazon to a Texas Troubadours CD album recorded in England/Eurpoe by a bunch of unknown artists singing a different set of songs than the CD album by Capital Records. Not sure why Amazon Music would do this switcheroo and do it so unnoticeably smoothly.
4,Texas Troubadours,I bought this for only one song on it. That was just beyond the moon by Tex Ritter. Some of the other songs are good but not all.
1,J. Renne Bag,"Three words: Ugly silver carboard. That's what this purse is! I usually like quirky grown-up things, but this is just ugly. It's so stiff! I returned this immediately, luckily Amazon has a great return policy and I got my money back and bought better stuff."
4,It could have ended better with a little more thought...,"Don't read this if you haven't read the whole book!When Dumbledore dies, Hermione should have used the time-turner to redo the whole thing."
5,Potter Girl,"I read this in two days and I liked it much better than the Order of the Phoenix. In the Phoenix Harry seems to be much more angry and depressed as any teenager is, but in this one he seems to have worked through a lot of his anger. I don't care for how it ended but I guess Rowling had no choice but to make it a cliffhanger for her next and last book in the Potter series. As always this book was an enjoyable read as all the others were and I hated when it ended. It could have been a little longer in my opinion."
5,Easily the best one yet.,"Darker yet again then any of the previous offerings and by far more emotional. It is the ability of this book to envoke emotion that makes it so good.I do not want to say more lest I give anything away but the ending is sad, happy, pointedly linear and questioningly open ended all at the same time.An incredible read that I shall start again tomorrow =)"
4,Great Book,I love Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince! Even though I haven't finished it yet I can tell it will be a great book through the end like it has been so far. I highly reccomend it!
2,eh...,"well for a book in general, i thought it was good. but for harry potter, it actualy kind of sucked. it didnt really seem like a story. things moved in a strange order and almost everything was just factual. nothing was well explained. the end was stupid and sudden. im not going to suggest not to read this, of course you SHOULD read it. its harry potter! ill read it again and probabl more times after, i just think that it was lacking the magic the first earlier books had & hope the last in the series turns out a little more enjoyable."
1,Disappointed,"#6 is not a bad book. It is interesting, but it's missing something. It's worthy of respect, but not of love.While #1 through #5 were all exceptional, #6 is a journeyman(woman) effort. It doesn't elevate my mood. It doesn't make me yearn for more.Rowling is not completely up to the task of injecting realism in a manner appropriate for this series. There is not adequate compensation for the downers.It may be that Rowling's motives are something other than entertaining the same audience that purchased the first 5 books. Possibly she is looking for approval from the community of critics and peers who hold their own technical standards higher than the enjoyment of millions of readers.It may be a three star book, but... I give it ONE STAR, because the book is forced into a series where it doesn't belong."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I received my copy of HBP at almsot 1:00 A.M. this morning. I hurried home so that i could get an early sart. I just finished it an hour ago and my brain is still numb. I was waiting for this book for over 2 YEARS! Now that it finnaly came, i find that staying up all those nights on the computer just trying to find info on HBP was a waste of energy. I should've known that it was going to be very disappointing. For those of you who REALLY don't beleive me, buy it... read it... get on here and write a review... and i think that you will find that your review is the same as mine."
2,Unneccessary to the series,"I like Harry Potter. The 3rd and 4th books being my favorite. The 5th being too long and and a little too 'conspiracy theory' for my taste but still full of action. The 6th is completely unneccessary. It's like an entire book of 'filler'. If you compact the parts of the book that are really important to the story they'd probably only take up about 3 chapters... Out of 30! The rest of the book is way too slow. Just Harry following around Malfoy going on about his potions book and pining over Ginny. It just seems like the author didn't have enough good story line for 7 books so she just cranked out a long account of Harry's 6th year at Hogwarts... And then something important happens at the end. I guess it needs to be read in order to finish the series, but I really hope book 7 has way more action and isn't too long like book 5. Get the the action and get to the point. A simple idea that J. K. Rowling doesn't seem to grasp."
3,I would have bought something else if I was looking for DRAMA.,"Whether or not you like this book will most likely depend on your answer to this question: do you like HP books because of their characteristic ability to keep you reading through the night because you just have to read ""one more chapter?"" or is it their refreshing nature as a ""children's book?"" If you answered the former, this book will definitely keep you up all night, since it is similarly organized to HP 4 and 5, where there is a lot of seemingly unimportant, but intense action that all seems to untangle into a coherent mass as the book progresses. However, if, like me, you like to read HP because it transports you into a magical world where surely nothing worse than growing an extra set of eyebrows will happen, you are in for a huge disappointment. If you want a children's book, stick to the first three installments of the HP series."
2,Departs from what made the other books so great,"I love the Harry Potter series, but I was very disappointed in this book. The first 500 pages drag on, the whole time you are waiting for something big to happen, and it does. But, the wait is too long and the climax you waited for isn't what you wanted. Afterwards, you have a sour taste in your mouth and become frustrated at the direction Rowling has taken with the characters you care so much about.I will now relate some of the major plot holes I had with the book. Perhaps some of them will be explained in Book 7, but that's not good enough. In the best book series, the individual books are able to stand on their own, independent of the others, but seamlessly interwoven. Thus, the plot holes that end this book are inexusable.The book is interesting, and at its best moments you won't be able to put it down, but it's not as fun as they other books, and that's what really matters in the end.(...)"
2,Shoddy writing,"Any expectations I had of Rowling were fully let down by this sixth installment. Maybe she was trying a new writing style, or maybe she was preoccupied, but this book is a disappointment to me.. and I'm normally a HUGE fan. Harry seems even more isolated from everyone. All the characters seem to be lacking all their usual traits that we've grown to love. And you'd think that after losing Sirius, Harry would feel angrier, or at least turn to Lupin, being his father's last surviving friend. Readers are still left with unanswered questions about the Evans, the Potters, and about Neville. We want to know how Voldemort was thrice defied by Alice and Frank, and by Lily and James. We want to know about the OotP has been up to, now that they're not guarding the Prophecy. We want to know more of Dumbledore's background. The book leaves readers wondering if Rowling accidentally Apparated and left her imagination and writing skills behind. Hoping for a MUCH better book next time!"
1,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,It was a good book because it has suspence and Rowling is not afraid to let some characters go like Dumbledore! I've read all of the books up the this one and this is by far the best! Can't wait to read Deathly Hallows
4,I liked it a lot!,"I really liked this book. The memories are really interesting and the over-all plot was brilliant. The only thing I didn't like about this book was seeing everybody grow up so fast. All the sudden there were teenage hormones and everybody likes everybody else and everybody is jealous of the rest of them. I don't see the point of putting making-out and attacking one-another for liking somebody else.Even with this draw-back it's an excellent book that reveals lots of the mysteries behind Voldemort, Harry, and secrets we didn't even know were secrets.Over-all it was a good book and you should definitely buy it!"
2,Best,Best book ever I loved this book so much because j.k Rowling is just the best writer to ever walk this planet she is my hero and I look up to her she is my role model
5,Cool,"Great book, so sad in the end I wish there was more abouthogwarts Harry potter is a great book, really"
2,fun is gone,"Think back with me, if you can, to the first Harry Potter book, before all the hype went overboard, before the noisy movies, when there was just a book that we liked. We liked it because it was: 1) magical and whimsical 2) funny and 3) for children. This latest installment is none of the above. What's left to like? Long, ghoulish murders?"
3,Well....,"Personally, I thought that the lastest Harry Potter installment was filler. It had no real plot, but it more or less leads readers right into the seventh and final book. Some parts were good, but others seemed really predictable, although the final scene with Snape and Dumbledore did shock me. The one part of the book I really enjoyed was at the very end. It did show that Harry was mature, and was ready for his final meeting with Voldermort, again, leading us right into the final book. This wasn't my favorite Harry Potter book, but I'm sure Rowling had her reasons for this adequate addition."
3,This was very sad.,"Good writing. Good plot.Hated it.Not that I don't LIKE Harry Potter. I love it.I waited 200 days for this book... counting down the days. I was very much disappointed with the outcome of 9 hours non-stop reading on July 16, 2005. I just didn't like it.The ending left with a very hollow, incomplete feeling. I don't think this book was fulfilling, having waiting this long for it. I was extremely unhappy with the outcome of the adventures (or lack thereof) the HP gang had. It was still a good read because it was Harry Potter, but I don't think I'll read it more than twice (once more to see if it gets any better... though I doubt it).I hate to give a back review because people will hate me. But I really did not like this installment.Too many twists for me, thanks."
3,fanfiction,"I closed Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince with the feeling of having read a particularly good piece of fanfiction. It's interesting, but it just doesn't measure up to the other five. The writing style has gone downhill, the plot is predictable. the death at the end does not have the emotional effect on Harry, or me, that it should. The one storyline in this book I enjoyed is that of discovering who the Half-Blood Prince is. That plotline is well developed and suspenseful, and the discovery is shocking. I only wish the rest of the book was as well written."
4,Interesting,"I was a little dissapointed that the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series was so short. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a story that was, sadly, an unfortunate book because of the loss to Harry during the end of the book. :P. Maybe that will make you consider to get this book. This book was, I'm sorry to say, not as great as the other books prior to the sixth book. I would have to say that this is actually an alright book. I probably would have liked it better if I did not expect so much from the book. But, as I stated before in text, I think that this book is worth buying, and I hope that you enjoy your book. Thank you for your time.-Hardeep Chana"
4,So gud!,This book is the 2nd best best of the harry potter series. I dont know why ppl are trashing the book but in ma point of view this book only gets 4 stars because of the tragic event that took place and because of the book being short. I finished it in a day......I was least expecting about 1000 pages or so....but anyway this book is a musst have for any reader!!
3,not her greatest,"this is probably the worst in the series. It seemed to be more liek a FanFiction, all the different couples, the ending for tonk's sadness,dumbledore dying. it was just to fast. but then having dumbledore die gave the book a good ending i guess. the whole ron and hermione ""drama"" was annoying, and harry deciding to choose between ginny and ron keep the friendship or get the gf..was just stupid. but then i guess if this one is bad then the seventh book will probably be good since we might have lower expectations and want to complete the series, maybe that was her plan all along."
3,disappointing,"I was waiting anxiously for this to come out, but writing felt rushed and plot seemed squeezed into last couple chapters. Even with this, still looking forward to book 7."
4,"Awesome book, bad ending","I have read every ""Harry Potter"" book in the series, and they continue to get better, and better! The first few chapters of this book were very tedious, I thought, until Harry finally retuned to Hogwarts. Once I plowed my way through the boring beginning of the book, and got into the main plots, I found it one of the most addicting books I have ever read! As Dumbledore informs Harry of Voldemort's secret to near immortal life, Harry also tries to find out and stop what Malfoy is secretly up to in the room of requirements. However, the end is very tragic, as one of the main and most beloved characters is killed by a very surprising death-eater. Overall, this was probably the best book I ever read, and I could hardly put it down! I strongly encourage anyone who is a fan of the ""Harry Potter"" series, or enjoys reading fantasy or action/adventure books to read ""Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince""!"
4,Half Blood Prince,"The sixth installment of this marvelous series answered many of the questions hanging out there that were formulated in the first five books. It also added new questions that will be tricky for Ms. Rowling to answer with just one book left in the series, but I am sure she will overcome this with her skilled writing technique. I will be greatly saddened to see this series end as it has brought so much fun into reading for young children, young adults, and older adults. It created a bond between age groups to debate joyfully."
5,Another Home Run!,"We all enjoyed the book HP&HBP.; Ms Rowling has a gift to fascinate young and old alike. The audio of the book, read by Jim Dale, is equally as enjoyable. It is wonderful on long car rides. Everyone in the family is entertained. The only negative is that when I read aloud to my children, they comment on my shoddy British accent now that they have heard it read by a master.We can hardly wait for book 7. Reserve my copy now!"
5,Very good,"The book is amazing. I pre-ordered back in December and the book was in my mailbox June 16th. It was amazing, highly recommend the book."
4,Can't wait for the last book!,"Like others, I am caught in JK Rowling's web and am helpless. I really enjoyed this book and have read it twice to date. What and where are the rest of the horcrux's? Is Harry a horcrux himself, his ability to speak snake language and his scar, the evidence? Does Neville Longbottom have a heroic destiny? Will the time-turner feature in book 7, or perhaps the poly-juice potion? Is the greatest wizard of all time REALLY dead? Lots of intriguing possibilities. The problem is that I am forced to endure an incredible cliff hanger for as long as it takes the last book to come to market. I know that when book 7 comes out, these questions will be answered, but until then...Argh!!!"
3,Disappointing,"Like everyone, I waited with bated breath for the 6th book to come out, and had it preordered. I read it in 3 days and of all 6 books so far, this is my least favorite. The story felt rushed to me and I missed the more descriptive way in which Rowling wrote the previous 5 books. What happened to the owls? to Crookshanks? Other than a few mentions in the beginning, we never read another thing about them. Even past characters like Neville Longbottom didn't have much of a part in the story. The things I did enjoy were finding out more of Voldemort's past and the introduction of Greyback, though his mention was also brief. I also liked that Rowling started the book differently than in the past. I missed the more lighthearted comic relief though, especially in the form of the Dursleys. Not mentioned enough! I was also disappointed in Snape's character. He was much more interesting in the previous books. I hope the 7th book wraps up all the loose ends!"
5,Rowling's depth hits again,"J.K. Rowing is such a detailed writer, with twists and turns all around. I believe completely that things aren't as they seem. Appearances can be changed and senses tricked in these books. That is what is really fun about these books. Things are so complex, that there is no way anyone can be sure how things will turn out in the end. J.K. Rowing is not a stagnant writer whose writing is predictable. This books reveals a lot of new information and creates new questions to be answered in the last book. Fans will not be completely disappointed, although they will definitely go through mourning at the end."
4,Wonderful read!,"For a series of books designed for children, I've found it to be very entertaining....and I'm pushing 40! My only complaint about the Half-Blood Prince is that a lot of the events in the book are very predictable. Harry gets a used potion book that anyone can tell from the beginning is going to cause him trouble. That's the only spoiler I'll give out!"
4,Not as good as I expected,"I read the book and was a little disappointed to find that most of it goes describing people, how the dressed and how they behaved, but nothing of real action. Just the last pages were really interesting. I think J.K. Rowlling wrote this book as a preparation to the 'grand finale', she didn't have to take that long to write this book."
1,Illegal,There is no confirmation on any official site. This can not be a legal authorized version. DO NOT BUY!!!!
3,Good....but i expected more,"Frankly, when i picked up my copy of HP6, i was expecting a *lot* more than what JKR gave me.I definitely thought this would be darker than book five, but well, i also wanted more action. I wanted to see Harry win, atleast a part of the battle. But not much happens in HP6. Disappointing.And yes, it kept getting preachy at times, with Dumbledore extolling the virtues of a whole soul, and about Voldemort's fears. Better editing could have made it a much pacier, and interesting book. But anyways, its still nice. A must read for every HP fan out there. And i am already waiting for the final installment, its high time harry got 'em all."
5,Neither can live while the other survives....,"The 6th book of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, has some question answered. We see how Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort through the memories of Albus Dumbledore and a few others.Dummbledore is giving Harry private lessons, Draco is up to something, and who is the Half-Blood Prince? The war between Lord Voldemort and the Ministry of Magic has been going on for a year. And there has been loses. And there is a major lost in the finale of the Half-Blood Prince."
5,Best book so far,"This book is definately the best one so far in the series. It has exciting moments, sad moments, and scary(ish) moments. It also reveals many answers to questions that people have had throughout the series. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure or just wants to read a fun book. I cannot wait for the last book to come out."
2,Extremely Disappointing!,"After waiting so long for the 6th book, Half-Blood Prince was a real disappointment! It does not come even close to the quality level of JK's writing in the 4th and 5th books. There is no depth to the story line and many of the existing lines from prior books were sadly left unanswered. This book is a pale ghost to her exceptional style and character/plot development previously demonstrated. It appears fame and enjoyment of her fortune may be more important to JK these days, rather than striving to complete the Harry Potter series at the quality level it deserves."
3,I didn't like the ending!,"The 6th book took too long to get to the good part. There was way too much of nothing in the first half of the book. Then I was very disappointed that Dumbledore died, especially after having spent so much time reading nothing. It just shouldn't have happened. I thought he was the support for Harry. Where will Harry be without Dumbledore? I may not even read book 7 if Dumbledore is no longer a character."
4,Review of HP and the Half Blood Prince,"There are tons of reviews on here so I will keep this short. This book simply sets up the scenario for the seventh book. This is the first novel in the series that there is no resolution to conflict and there is a definite hook that makes you want the next novel immediately. There is also the death of one of the major characters. I have not liked all the Harry Potter novels, but I really liked this novel. It was suspenseful and read very fast. It takes you through Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts. One of the problems that I have had with this series is trying to remember all the events that have happened in past books and getting frustrated because I could not link them into what I was currently reading. For some reason I think Rowling must have understood this was a problem with readers because I found in this book that she did a great job giving us reminders of what had happened in the past. It made it so much easier to read and understand."
5,A bounceback from Book 5 -- scotrstone.com,"After reading Book 5 in the series, I was a little more cautious going through the latest installment of Harry Potter. I am happy to admit that this book was a lot tighter than Book 5 and one of the better stories in the series. Everyone in the wizarding world is now acknowledging that Voldemort is back -- finally. Hermoine is once again brilliant -- my favorite character by far in the series. We get a lot more background on the Riddle family, and, of course, there is a shocker ending, which I didn't mind, considering there is a war going on. Because the author kills off a major character does not mean you should automatically hate the book, but instead look for solid reasons as to why it was done. There is motive, but it won't be fully revealed until Book 7."
2,Rather useless. Almost nothing new. Let's hope number 7 is better.,"Up to this point I have inmensely enjoyed all previous episodes of Harry Potter. I am very disappointed by this one, though. It is rather dull and unimaginative, MUCH too long. By too long I mean that in fact, almost nothing happens in the whole book until the very end. The rest is just the usual Harry-thinks-Snape-is-evil-and-Dumbledore-benevolently-says-he-trusts-Snape. Add to that a truckload of teenagers' agonizing about who to date and how, and you end up with this 600-page monster. The interesting information is contained in under 30 pages. At the end of the book, we're almost at the same spot we were at the end of the ""Order of the Phoenix"". Let's hope Book 7 is better. Clearly, this one was the weak link of the series."
3,A Half Finished Book,"After reading Prince, I read the previous HP books again. The biggest shortcoming was that this book felt like a prelude to the last book of the series. It could have been made a lot smaller and tighter. All other books manage to stand on their own, not this one. As a prelude to Book 7, it is great, as a stand alone book, well it is not so great.This harsh review doesnt mean that, I would not be standing in queue at 3AM to buy book 7. As Ms. Rowling has already finished that, so a humble request is to have that printed as soon as possible. So that we can enjoy Potter and Ms. Rowling can enjoy peace & quiet (at least for a while, before we clamor for more Potter).Regards"
3,Why so much background??,This book was good but no where near as good as the others. The whole plot of know your enemy so you can't defeat him was o.k. but didn't need to take up the whole book. What happened to all the other great characters and a bigger story line. Who really cares that voldermort had a srewed up past that was pretty self explanatory by just reading the other five books. The only good part was the last hundred plus pages. But I thought the way she killed of that character was so wrong made them sound like a groveling little whimp didn't even die on their feet. And what happened to harry he was supposed to be so good at defense against the dark arts but couldn't even master silent spells to save his life or anyone elses.
4,"Not the best, but still good","As I've seen many other customers complain, it seems a bit contrived. His special lessons seemed a forced way to provide exposition, while his relationship with Ron and Hermione didn't feel as genuine. They ignored his fears when we know they wouldn't really ever do that. It felt very much that J.K. Rowling had an outline, and make sure she hit every point, without seeing if they flowed together naturally or believably. But still - humorous, sad, dark, couldn't put it down, etc etc. I hope for better things in Book 7, that will make me look back on this one and see why she had to do things they way she did them. And as for the ending, if you're going to do that, do it so it makes me cry. It lacked true emotion, to me. Just another check on her checklist of things to do in this book. Read it, however, to make your own judgements. I know people who believe this is the best book yet."
5,very good,Book 4 in the series still remains my favorite but this books certainly gave it a run for it's money. For me book 5 was a bit of a let down. It was a necessary book for the series and i still thought it was very good... but it was too different. The characters personalities were different than they were in past books. All in all next to book 4 this is the best. So basically this gets the second place trophy.
5,Once again more questions,Leaves us wanting more......I agree with others that book number 7 is going to have to be epic in length to answer all of the questions!
5,Wonderful!!,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was absolutely wonderful!! I got it Saturday morning and finished it Sunday night. I laughed, I rejoiced, and I cried at the end. This book and Goblet of Fire are by far the best. It showed Harry becoming a young man and the true love that Dumbledore feels for Harry and vice versa. This book also shows that Draco Malfoy is human. At the end of the book you will see the true friendship, and courage that Ron and Hermione demonstrate towards Harry, and Ginny's incredible strength. Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince rocks!!!!"
5,JK Rowling..ready for the adult world,"The 6th installment of JK Rowling's 7 book series is a must read. Harry and the gang are on the threshold of adulthood, and the plot has definately thickened. Without revealing too much of this nail-biting page turner, I must warn you to expect the unexpected. If Ms. Rowling is contemplating a move to an adult series of books, then she most certainly will have me as a ready and waiting reader."
2,Not to par,"The other books up to this one were good. Half-Blood Prince was...not so much. J.K.'s writing style was not as good; the plot was not as developed; overall, this book does not demonstrate the skill that showed in the other books.Unfortunately, you have to read it. The next book promises to be good, and it won't make any sense unless you read this one. Of course, I would have thought from Order of the Pheonix that Half-Blood Prince was going to be good, too, so who can say."
4,"I ponder and say; ""Um...""","They book was definitely a exhilirating and it will embrace your expectations and rip them out throughout the story. It kept me reading alot more than in the 4th or 5th book. I indulged myself with the book but realized some inconsistancies like the scene of Dumbledore swimming with an injured hand, and Harry's sensitivity towards things. And the ending was really intense and I was NOT ready for it at all. I read the last few chapters and I just said; ""What?!?"". How is the story supposed to go on? A part of me within that story emptied and I really had no clue how the story could possibly go on into anymore of something worth telling. It was like scraping my knee badly while running and reluctant to go back to that place. I'm just confused and sad. And ""Um..."" would just about describe it."
2,a letdown,"Virtually plotless through and through. Book 6 and 7 should have been released at the same time to avoid dissappointment. All of the previous books built the main plot, but also had their own, where as 6's climax was rather anti-climatic, and its purpose was just one big 600 page buildup to #7. Not as big a downer as #5, it was by no means an upper. #7 is gonna have to be spectacular to make up for this, but I still have faith in Rowling."
1,Very disappointed,"I have read Harry Potter for half my life (I am 14). I have loved the first five (five especially) and was really saddened by this one. It was badly written, and the romance between Harry and Ginny was out of the blue. I doubt I will ever reread it."
3,Middle of the Road,"This book, while well written was completely boring. J.K. did a great job of adding to the story but the first 400 or so pages are all ""fluff."" the best part is the end, skip to that"
3,Disappointed....unfortunately No spoilers,"I have been a rabid adult Potter fan for 3 years now and was waiting breathlessly for the latest installment to the series. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed overall with the work. What I have come to enjoy most about this series is Rowling's loving care of her characters (my opinion)and the strong development of the key and sometimes not key but interesting chatacters we as readers encounter along the way. This book is sorely lacking in this aspect. Granted there are some answers to lingering questions given to many mysteries that have baffled readers through the first 5 tomes, but not nearly enough and that paired with the weak treatment she gave to the veteran and new characters just made this book smack of, dare I say, bad fan fiction. I'll still remain a loyal fan of the series I'm just not a fan of this installment. Sorry Jo :("
3,Not worth the hype,"After reading the Half-Blood Prince, all I can say is that it wasnt nearly as good as was expected. The book is slow and in many places boring. It doesnt really become exciting until the last 150 or so pages and the ending is mediocer at best. It seems Rowling is out of ideas and filled the book with fluff and hoped a more action packed ending would make people forget about the bordom that preceded it. Its worth reading just to go on with the series, but dont get your hopes up."
2,Ehhh...not so much,"I don't want to write a review that takes 15 minutes to load, but I have to say that I was highly disappointed with this book. While it has more of the feeling of books 1-4 (since book 5 is a lot more angry and emotional than the others), it breaks pattern in a not-so-good way. I don't want to spoil anything, but the fact that the only true encounters with Voldemort are in the memories of others really screws stuff up. So, while there are some interesting hook-ups and break-ups, and a death that could have been heartwrenching (I cried about the death in book 5, not this one), overall this book is pretty much...bleh."
5,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6),"Jim Bale's voice emphasized the different characters in unique tones. He added a new layer to the book, revealing details I once stumbled over."
3,The weakest of the series,"Once I began reading the Harry Potter books, I was unable to stop. In fact, I read all books up through #5 in the span of one week. I was quite excited about #6 coming out. I felt that this book had a good start, but then it just died off. It was like I was just waiting and waiting for something to happen, and it never really did until the very end. I was never caught up in the story as I was in the previous 5 books. I felt that of the books, this was the weakest, as the characters and plot was not as compelling or engaging as they had been in the past. I still enjoyed the book, and appreciated the new information gained about characters, such as more of an explanation of Voldemort's past, however I will admit to being slightly dissappointed. I will still eagerly await the final book, and believe that it will be the true test of JKR's writing skills to see how she ties everything up."
4,Is it permanent?,"I bought the british hardcover with the black dust jacket - just to be different - but the story filled my greedy need for this tale to go on to a such a point that now my greed cannot be quenched!If it was action packed, it was - but Rowling stays true to the baseline, and that's what keeps a thirty-something hooked. :)"
4,"This is not intended to be ""great"" literature...","I bought this book, 3 copies, for my kids. They read it for fun, not as something to dissect for English. That said, my youngest (age 11) feels that it must have received some very heavy handed editing, perhaps with a view to an eventual movie script. My fourteen year old maintains it's the funniest yet, especially with respect to teen interaction. Enjoy it for what it is!"
3,Good Quality?,"Once I got the book, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, I was very disappointed to find that the book wasn't in very good condition. The cover is ripped and the edges are folded. I don't think this item was worth the $6.25."
3,slightly displeased,"I believe the condition for this book was set at good when I purchased it from the seller, and when I received it, it was not. Half the back cover was torn off, and it seems some of the pages had gotten wet at some point as well. There were no issues for reading the book, just the aesthetics weren't as promised."
5,Good book,"I haven't finished the book but I really like it so far. I think if you have read all the previous books, there's no point in not getting the book."
3,Call it Book 5 and 1/2,"As a huge fan of the Harry Potter series (I airmailed the first book home to myself after reading it on vacation) I hate to admit it, but this installment was disappointing for me. Almost entirely expository, this book seems to exist purely as a set-up for the next one. I don't doubt the necessity of it, the over-all plot has taken a big left turn with the information in THBP, but it feels a bit like the 'jump from platform to platform/get object from Boss' level in a video game - like filler. Where is the humor, and pardon the intended pun, but where is the magic that was so captivating in the first books in the series? I read and re-read the early books over and over, and am still moved by them. Wait for the Cliff Notes, or just read an online blog summary - given the speed at which we've all plowed through this installment, It'll save you at least 4 hours and the effect will unfortunately be similar."
4,Harry Potter,"Out of all the Harry Potter books, this one was my second favorite. It was really creative and had many factors to it. I liked how J.K. Rowling intertwines the magical world with the teenage world. There are many dramatic points to the story and it all comes together so well."
5,brilliant!,this 6th book is her best book so far! i enjoyed reading it. this is really a page turner.
2,Not up to JK Rowling's standard,"This book was, sadly, quite disappointing. Order of the Phoenix left me with high hopes after having such a spectacular finale. But the mysteries of the Department of Mysteries, the mirror, and other good aspects one would expect to pop up did not. Instead the book was heavily dominated by characters pairing up together as their hormones apparently became more important than the war itself. A lot of the relationships felt cliche and unbelievable... just thrown together. There was good characterization of some characters like Snape, and the final battle was quite intense, but I was sadly let down by this book after seeing how outstandingly wonderful (and far more memorable) books 3-5 had been. It felt like J.K. Rowling handed off the writing in HBP to someone completely different at times."
5,Outstanding,I give J.K.Rowling a standing ovation. Read it in three days and loved every word. She's starting to tie all the end together I can't wait to see what happens next. This is a brillant writer with an amazing imagination and a way with words so that we can see her world.
4,"One problem, but otherwise quite good.","I like the 6th book in the series much for than the 5th. It is very interesting and has some surprising events, but only gets exciting in the last 100 or so pages. Although the rest of the book is also pretty good, people who like to get to the point quickly may become frustrated with this. Still, I definitely recommend this for a nice, thorough read."
5,"Great book and artwork, worth the extra to get the Deluxe version","The Harry Potter series is great for both young and old. The Deluxe version is a bit more money but well worth it with the artwork, binding, and slip cover. A great gift for a Harry Potter fan or collector."
5,Long drives fly by with Harry,"The audiobooks of the Harry Potter series are amazingly entertaining. Jim Dale, the performer who gives voice to scores of characters in each of the six books so far, is incredible. With relatives in the midwestern U.S., we drive there twice each year from the mid-Atlantic region. What is normally a tedious drive just flys by thanks to these audiobooks. It's the one thing we can play in the car that all ages in our family enjoy. Rowling's imagination and Dale's performance are magical wonders in their own right."
5,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Price,"Have not read the book yet, but know it will be great just like the other books"
4,COOL!,"This book was so cool! I can't believe it was better than all the others. However, it reminded me kind of Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate. Well actually, I think D: LT was better, but HP is still pretty cool."
4,Does Not Dissapoint,"I was not dissapointed by this newest intallment in the Potter series, but I did finish the book with a little less of a ""wow"" feeling than the previous few books. While both ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" were more action packed, this book was more back story and set up.I have heard J.K Rowling describe this book as ""Part 1 in a two part story. Part two being being book 7"" With that in mind, this book is excellent. Very much a set-up for what is going to happen to end the series. It was nice to get all the back story that i've been only guessing at until this point.It will be a long and painful wait until book seven! :)"
1,Harry Potters a n00b,Wow i hated this book...I could totally pwn Harry Potter at a game of Quidditch.
2,It was O.K...,"Meh, I read the book and it was okay, the Harry potter books started to loose it's touch around the second book. (...)"
1,Harry Potter is Awful......,"This book is awful. The first few Harry Potter books were ok reads for children, but the series has gotten old fast. The Half-Blood Prince put me to bed on numerous occasions and I haven't even finished it.Nobody but under-15 year olds should be reading Harry Potter anymore anyways."
2,Attention Everybody.,"Look, half of you who gave this book 1 star or 2 stars, you only did because of the Amazon shipment. What does that have to do with Harry Potter? And secondly, I have read all the Harry Potter books and I found them all terrible except for the fourth which is definitely (by far) the best one. Harry Potter, in my opnion, is meh...."
2,"boring, not up to previous quality","I had reservations about reading this book, since the last two seemed to become progressively darker and darker. However, I couldn't resist finding out what happened. Oh, boredom! The entire premise of the series has deteriorated into silly teen romance. Ron and Hermione could have been at another school, for all the interest they contributed to the book. The last hundred pages picked things up a bit, but the whole thing is such an obvious setup for the last book. Series books should flow together well, but they also should be able to stand on their own. This was just a prequel to the final book, and all the info could have been written into a couple chapters. Yawn..."
3,"Not the best, by far.","I must admit that I was anticipating this novel since Order of the Phoenix, when I started reading though, I wasn't drawn into it as I was with the rest in the series. Overall, it was a good novel, BUT, Rowling clearly left out her extremely descriptive style used in the previous installments, and it direly takes away from the storyline and flow of the bulk of Half-Blood Prince! I hope that I'm not the only Potter fan who sees this and also that Rowling takes this type of feeling in stride for book 7... and that she goes back to the idea of making the novel longer in stride that she did with all of the series up until now."
1,"Failed, sadly, failed","I am frankly disgusted with the Half Blood Prince.I patiently plodded through pages and pages of what I assumed was a stately build-up to something well planned and thrilling, and found ... ?A plodding, pedestrian and, frankly, stupid plot line, with a completely cop-out ending. I finished the book in bed late at night, clapped it shut, said ""What a load of absolute Rubbish."", tossed it across the room onto the floor, and rolled over and went to sleep.In TV series parlance, Harry has finally ""Jumped the Shark"", ie. damaged its core essence so badly that no amount of re-writing later on, short of 'it was all a dream', will allow it to recover.In my opinion Ms. Rowling's only previous lemon was Chamber Of Secrets, and even it had its gripping and worthwhile components.Half-Blood Prince is simply dreadful, I'm sorry but its bad art.I would rather have waited another year while JKR re-wrote it than read this pile of pointless gibberings. Please do better with your next one Ms R.Jon"
2,"Quality, in a sense","For those of you who haven't read the book this review has a spoiler Okay? and here it is: There not only is a plot, but it ain't bad. I know, shocking isn't it?"
3,who cares about the half blood prince,"Why do we care who the half blood prince is? We already know him,we were all right about him, what's it got to do with anything.When you finish this book you still won't know!There are too many unansered questions!! Would Ron just kiss Hermione already(it's getting old)!!THENNNNN the end if I hadn't read all the other books I wouldn't have sobbed like a baby as it is I am very upset there was absolutely no reason for it. I almost wished I hadn't read it and very well might just end it in my head the way I want it to and not even bother reading the last one!!!!!!"
1,A cliff hanger ala TOTT.,"JK Rowling has written a cliff-hanger novel designed to attract more readers to the 7th and final novel? Hmmmn didn't Tom Clancy try that in The Teeth of The Tiger? What happened to that sequel Mr. Clancy? And where did you get that Idea from JK Rowling, The Hardy Boys? At least those books were interesting to teenagers...."
1,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"I paid for, but never received this book from the seller. I have contacted them 3 times during the past 6 weeks with no reply. Stay away from this seller!"
3,Perhaps Harry Needs AA,"As an adult fan of Harry Potter I have been surprised and a little shocked that from the very first chapter there is alcohol use so prominently displayed. It would seem that in The Half Blood Prince Harry has indeed grown up rather rapidly. Drinking and ""snogging"" isn't really appropriate reading for children, and many teens manage not to be involved with alcohol or other mind numbing things. I'm surprised at Scholastic for allowing this as it adds nothing to the book. The book is more appropriate for older children and adults with discussion with family readers about the drinking and morals in general. In general I have been fairly let down and it will be with morbid interest to see what happens last in the series. It's time to bring it to an end."
3,"This was great, but THE POWER OF CHOCOLATE was better!!!!","I thought that this book in the Harry Potter Series was more hyped up than it turned out to be. The first three books in the series were great, but the Harry Potter phase is slowly beginning to diminish. What is the curious reader to do now? Want some new action? New adventure? New characters? New plots filled with mystical creatures and magical endings? I recommend THE POWER OF CHOCOLATE by Savas Bachtsoglou. I believe that this new series will leave Harry Potter in the dust. No offense to Harry Potter or the author, I just believe that every story has its time in the lime light, and this time, the light belongs to THE POWER OF CHOCOLATE!!!!"
5,Best one yet,"Too bad so many people were bored or disappointed by this book. I found it dark and fascinating, probably the best of the series so far.That said, the ending was pretty depressing. Not just the death, but the fact that Harry isn't going back to Hogwarts and Ron and Hermione apparently are going to hang out with him.Hermione is way too smart to leave school, and I wanted Harry to become an auror. Maybe aurors won't be necessary after book seven, eh?I wasn't too pleased with the mangling of Bill Weasley either, though I liked the way Fleur came through,Unlike the readers who figured out early on who the half-blood prince was, I was a little surprised. But don't be fooled, Snape isn't a bad guy. We're just supposed to think so.As for the mysterious R.A.B., I say it is Regulus Black, dearly departed brother of dearly departed Sirius."
3,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood prince,"This is a very dark story, where the hero is trying to learn all the known information on Lord Voldemort, which he believes will aid him in his latest attempt to rid the world of Voldemort. Harry gets sidetracked from chapter to chapter, but when Harry is on track the story is very dark, much evil magic, and an emphasis on murder."
5,"Incredible, Fantastic, Intense, Superb, & Dark","Having waited the long two years between the books, I stayed up until 7 a.m. to read as much as I could before falling asleep. I finished the book just over an hour ago after taking a ""nap"". This book is all that could be expected and more. J.K. Rowling has really outdone herself with the 6th installment and has proved that patience on the reader's part will be greatly rewarded. Harry is all grown up in this book, as have all of the other main characters. The second chapter is incredibly intense...and it only gets better from there. This book is definitely darker than the last ones, and it should be. What happens in this book, while not unexpected, is certainly shocking."
4,Continues story line well - but cannot stand on its own.,"Any fan of the HP story will of course not want to pass up this book. It is a essential bridge between book 5 and the conclusion. Harry and friends grow up a little and take on some new responsibilities.However, it appears the characters in the story were just victims of the story - with no sentient, compellingly spontaneous qualities of their own - this is most sadenningly true of Harry. Harry is brilliant when the plot needs him to be and amazingly ignorant and suprisingly immature emotionally when everything we have been led up to believe would suggest he should act differently in certain situations.Perhaps here the pen controls the writer, more than just deliberate milking purely for commercial purposes. I would like to think the former.No new flights of fantasy and magic. No new characters/creatures. No climatic epiphanies. No gestalt.Just more of the same story grinding slowly to an inevitable conclusion..."
5,Highly recommended!,"I have been entranced with the HP books since they topped prestigious U.S. best seller lists and word spread that adults were enjoying J.K. Rowling's series as much as children. In my case, that's certainly true. I am 50+ and love all of the HP books. Every one is a unique adventure full of delights & surprises, with courage, wisdom, talent & loyalty battling fiercely against cunning, treachery and evil.IMO, the HBP story is perfect. I found the atmosphere, continuing character development, pace, and especially the relationship between HP and Professor Dumbledore very well done. The ending is a heartbreaker and cliffhanger. I can't wait to read the sure-to-be-stunning conclusion in Book 7, though I will never be ready to say goodbye to HP's wonderful main characters, the magnificent Hogwarts and countless other wonders of the HP world.Read it and enjoy!"
2,The weakest HP book so far.,"Although I like the previous HP books (no. 5 being my favorite), 'Half Blood Prince' fails to deliver a long awaited sequel. I read it less than a day, not because the story is so engaging that I couldn't focus to anything else, but because some parts are so dragging that I skim thru them. I don't like how the storyline is told from Snape's and Dumbledore's perspectives. Merely telling the plot twists is not the same as actually writing the sequence. It seems to me that the author scrambles to find ways to cover the plot holes that she makes the characters 'tell' the story as opposed to the other way around."
5,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"One more feather in the cap of J.K. Rowling for her latest adventures of Harry and cohorts. The book pages just dwindled as I thumbed my way through the exciting and tragic events. As usual, the next book will not come soon enough."
3,Good - But Not The Best,"Book #6 is very much like Movie #3. Both were good...but lacking in what made books 1-5 wonderful...The Characters. Neville, Draco & Luna were very minor characters...Seamus & Dean were just fill. While it was over 600 pages...it didn't feel like all the much happened. The year just sped by...not even a metion of Halloween. In short...just the facts & not well rounded. Personally, my least favorite of the 6...""Goblet of Fire"" was my favorite...""Order of the Phoenix"" the best written."
3,JK has lost her touch,"JK Rowling's first four books were fantastic. Full of adventure and fun. She's allowed Harry to grow a little from book to book, reflecting that in her writing style. The fith book fell slightly away from the others, becoming a little darker. But it still held on to the same aura and feel that the rest of the series had. But this book shows proof of a complete change in JK Rowlings writing style.Yes, I understand that the plot becomes darker, and I'm not critisizing the plot at all. But... it seems like she's not quite sure how to work in Harrys growth into this book. This can be specifically seen in the way that she introduces the relationships in the novel. It almost sounds as if she copied it from a fan fic and added it into her overall book.I miss the quality of writing that she had in the previous books. I will go ahead and buy the next book, just to see what happens. But I don't think that JK entirely knows what she's doing writing a book made for an older age group."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad","Is the 7th book here yet? Talk about lack of creative storytelling. There is no plot to this book other than about twenty pages towards the end. Harry thinks Malfoy and Snape are death eaters...nobody believes him...blah,blah,blah for 600 pages. Hasn't this ""nobody believes Harry so there will be consequences"" concept already been used? Oh, to make it more interesting and fill some pages, let's delve into Voldemort's past, and wow, you guessed it, he's evil!! Now that's a surprise. Then just to make sure everybody goes out and buys the seventh book, let's throw in a spark of a story that should be explained in this book but somehow can't fit into 683 pages. I thought each book was supposed to stand on its own as a story but this is just a $17 prologue to the end of the series. J.K.'s got it figured out, slap Harry Potter & (insert interesting title that has little to do with the actual story here) and make yourself a billionaire. Kudos to her for that."
2,A disgrace to the Potter series,"I was very upset by this book. I am a huge Potter fan; I really loved books 2 and 5. I was hoping this book would be as good as 5, but it was not. 5 was packed with emotion, this one has hardly any emotions. Harry is dull, he is completely emotionless. Ron and Hermionie are useless and annoying characters in this book. The character development is terrible; all of the characters act like completely different characters. This ""book"" seems more like a screenplay than an actual book. It seems like it was writen by someone who knew nothing about Harry Potter. I only hope the 7th book will be better."
2,waiting again and again,"The series is slowly becoming into the Sopranos but even less; what I mean is that someone has to get ""whacked"" in the end. And considering how RK sets it up, you can guess by page 100 who it's going to be. The book contains very little substance and most of it the same stuff repeated over and over again, quidditch, dursleys, sorting hat, etc. It would be much more interesting to dwell on things we don't know about, like for a few pages what we found about Voldemort. But no, most of it is dedicated to rehashing old stuff. It's pretty disappointing considering the wait of 2yrs between each book. Another 2 years to wait..."
3,Unfortunate.,"I really enjoy the HP series for a variety of reasons-- however, this book seemed to have only a few really good chapters. I truly enjoyed chapter two and chapter twenty-three. Other than that... I was greatly disappointed.I didn't pick up Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to read about teenage relationships-- if I wanted that, I'd be reading teen novels. However, that particular topic appeared to be one of the few themes of the book.If you are a real Harry Potter fan, go ahead and read the book-- heavens know that there's JUST enough plot to make it worthwhile. But don't expect this to be the best book of the series if you're not excited by the prospect of ""snogging""."
2,Not her best effort,"Ms. Rowling appears to grow weary of her franchise. There's some interesting new background info (padding, perhaps?), but the ending is a total cop out and the writing is inspired only occasionally. As a die hard Potter fan, I was necessary I read it, but I should have saved my money and waited for the libaray to buy it."
3,Who are they kidding?,"The story is fantastic. A lot of questions are answered and a lot of plot lines that have been hinted at or unclear are brought to the surface. HOWEVER, it is blatantly obvious that this book was written by a ghost writer or book packager. The vocabulary is more difficult, a fact which I could accepet due to the fact that this book is no longer for young children. But given the uncharacteristic dialogue (my favorite example being when Dumbledore says 'And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure') and flowery language, the writing in this book doesn't even come close to fitting in with the first five. Although the story is both exciting and satisfying, I found the writing so distracting that it was like listening to a very thick accent...I just couldn't get past it."
2,Blech,"This book was O.K. but it could have been way better. It left so many loose ends to by tied up that it was getting really annoying when something was mentoned and never mentioned ever again. I never really got the plot until the very end, because it was so weak.ADVICE!!!! READ ALL OF THE OTHER ONES, NOT THIS ONE!!!!"
2,Dissapointing,"This book was a huge dissapointment. I love the Harry Potter books and always have picked them up immediately. However, book six, the ""Half Blood Prince"" didn't come close to the standard I have come to expect. This book was disjointed, the caracters weren't fully expanded and if was missing the flowing narrative that painted the story in the past.The last chapter of the book, was better than the rest and managed to pull it together, but what this book did was really set the stage for the next book, that we're gong to need to wait a year or two to read.This book was defenetely not worth the hype that led up to it's release, and I'm dissapointed JK Rowling chose to rely on her fanfair, not her talent. If the first few books were like this one, she wouldn't be so famous."
2,Disappointed!,"A real disappointment! 80% of the book was filler - only 20% was information needed to line up the final book. Considering what fabulous books J.K. Rowling has put out thus far in the series, the Half-Blood Prince was a huge letdown. Let's hope she gets back to her ""roots"" for the final book. Also, this is the first book in the series that I have no desire to see the movie or even wonder, ""Wow, how are they going to do that in the movie?"""
2,Slump in the Potter series,"Frankly, after reading some of the other reviews, i.e. all the ""best book ever"" reviews, I had trouble believing that I had read the same book as the other folks had.This is not up to the same standard as Book 5; character development is minimal, and the feel of the story is that it was rushed with the goal of getting Book 6 out of the way so that we could progress to the important Book 7--the Grand Finale.And frankly, I have to wonder if Rowling is playing mind games with her mostly loyal readers. The eventual identity of the Half Blood Prince was so contrived, it had the feel of second-rate fancfiction rather than first-rate professional fiction.I also have to point out that the plot device of ""Harry notices really important stuff and the adults all ignore him and he has to place himself in danger and do it all himself"" it getting very old--I hope that Book 7 will not only show a mature Harry, but will also show adult characters that have a bit more wit to them."
3,Harry Potter & The Half-Blood Prince,"This book just doesn't flow the way it's predecessors did. Harry's character is still developing as he is an older teenager on the brink of becoming your typical epic hero. Making mistakes and the accepting the consequences. The main question is finally answered... How does Voldemort keep coming back and how deep does his rabbit hole go? There were 2 extremely funny parts, one involving Fred's bottom.Yet again there is a tremedous blow to Harry character emotionally. Testing his will. This makes reading the end of the book miserable. It's too bad that last book isn't out, it would have made it easier to keep reading.Rowling has set the stage well for the last installment but she will sure have a lot to pack in. Worth reading."
4,Very Entertaining,"My kids (17,16,13 and 11) and I used this product on our holiday trip through Western Canada and on Vancouver Island in August 2006. We had read the book before and thought it would be fun to listen to it on our travels. An extra bonus was that it is read by the same fellow that narrates the bonus items on the DVDs. Though it was a tad pricey, I would recommend it to any Harry Potter fan."
5,Just a thought...,"Just wanted to say the book was absolutely splendid. It was my favorite out of all 5 books previous, considerably better than book 5. Anyway, this isn't a real review, but just to catch your attention, at the end of book 6, you see the initials R.A.B at the end of a written letter. (This is not a spoiler, it will not detract from your reading experience, so don't worry.) I am nearly positive, that the initials R.A.B stand for Regalus Black, Sirius's brother. I am not sure what his miiddle initial is but I am nearly positive that is who wrote the letter."
3,Half-Blood Prince half as good,"When I read the Harry Potter Stories I read them as if every word was true, it's as if I am in the book, and I cannot let go. So after all the events of book five I was just dying for the sixth book to arrive. I actually ordered the special edition that was sixty dollars (got it here for fifty) and was so exited before reading it. Sadly thats all the exitement there was. The book was slow paced, there was no real climax, and characters seemed out of character. There was too much romance for my taste, and it seemed to want to turn into a detective novel at certain times. As I read I couldn't help but feel I was reading some fan fiction.I suggest people just to buy the paperback edition because this books is not even as exiting as the first one."
2,Just Terrible,I wish I wouldn't have read this. Not only is it just horrible in and of itself... it damages all the other books. It takes down every interesting character. I was extremely disappointed.
3,repeat of book 5,"This book mimics book 5 way too much to earn more then 3 stars. The story is Harry nows something bad is goin on with certain characters and nobody seems to believe then...(no spoilers here)the main problem with book is that it only provides information about characters and it simply is a foreshadow of final book 7. though it is necessary for the reader to learn everything book half blood prince, it would have been better if rowlanding condesde it a little and got to the ending that much faster because it seems to drag along at times with all the different back stories. in the end i did enjoy reading it and wasn't too bored, but this just wasn't up to par with book 4 or 5."
5,I love Harry Potter,"This is, what else, a fantastic book... you only have to know that it is number one ranked selling out of all the books in the world to realize that. Read it!"
3,"Good, but not up to the rest of the series","B. Capossere wrote: ""At the least, book six in the Harry Potter series does what it needs to: it moves the characters along in their personal and magical development; it fills in some previous gaps of knowledge; especially with regard to Voldemort's past; it continues to raise the level of urgency and danger as previous books have, it adds a few more mysteries/cliffhangers; and it ends with a clear pointing toward a final climactic battle. The problem, though, is that the book does the least one would expect and no more.""I have to agree with that assessment 100%. The book was uninspired and felt rushed. I would rather Ms. Rowling take her time and craft the story to perfection, as she did with the earlier books (particularly books 4 and 5), than meet her production deadline with a mediocre manuscript."
4,The best so far,I really enjoyed this Harry Potter book. Which is something that I couldn't really say for any of the previous ones.I'm very much looking forward to the next one.
5,An excellent prelude to the final book 7!,"Much of 'Scary Harry' book 5 seemed to turn upon explaining the whole Harry universe. There was more to qualify the existence than action within it. However, with this book, pacing carries you on a frenetic journey that whets your enthusiasm for book 7, indeed."
5,I have to admit it was good,"I have never been a Harry Potter fanatic don't consider myself a huge fan of the books but I do enjoy the movies. Maybe it's the British humor that I can never get the hang of I don't know. ""Pete what did you think of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince if you were so unmoved by the rest of the books?Well I liked the book a whole lot as it happened especially the ending which I will not give away. Ms. Rowling this time has turned out a book that can hold its own against all others of its kind (that's juvenile fantasy you understand not adult fantasy). All the things that make a book good can be found here and I have to say in terms of the plot and narrative flow the book just jives better then any of the others.Overall-The author finally has my convinced she can write a good book and I feel that I will be swept away on the wave of hype next time around. This book is good trust the word of a former skeptic please. This is the best Harry Potter book yet."
5,awesome,"I think this book is awesome. Harry's life keeps on getting worse and worse. I think it's funny how so many people are totally obsessed with Harry Potter, so they get it at midnight the moment it comes out, then don't put it down. I have a life to live, so I'm taking my time. Harry Potter can wait. But this is a book that's DEFINETLY hard to put down. J.K. Rowling is doing an amazing job with these books. AWESOME SERIES!"
5,Not just for the kids.,All six of the Harry Potter books are well written and not just for younglings. My 82 year old Mom and I are enjoying them as well. If you loved Narnia or The Hobbit you will love these as much. Doesn't everyone enjoy a story about good vs. evil?
4,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,I love the harry potter books series. The books or great.The six in the series was classic J.K.Rowling all the way ! but the last chapter left me MAD and in TEARS!The rest of the book kept me on the eadge of my chair an i could'nt wait to turn to the next page to see what happens next. A final warring be ready for a huge emotional SURPRISE at the end. You will be shock and amazine.
5,This muggle loved the Half Blood Prince,The sixth entry is my favorite in the series. This is also one of my favorite books of all time. Harry and company are growing up and it shows in form of story and tone.A lot of this book is taking up with the back story of Voldemort. With every turn J.K. defied my expectations. Special care is giving with the story of his parents. These scenes are what drives this plot.The ending will leave you shaking with disbelief.It is a perfect example on how to set up the finally without sacrificing story. I cannot recommend this book enough. I have read it about 8 times now and every time I read it I find something else to love about it.
3,Disappointed,"After so many reviews, I doubt anyone will read this, but I had to add my two cents. This book is nothing more than a set up for book seven. Although reviewers claim that this book is aimed at adults, not children, I disagree. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to determine what will happen in book seven based on book six.Book six needed to be flushed out, as well. For a Potter book, it was thin (600 pages.) It was predictable. I was disappointed."
1,"Five star ratings are jokes, 2 is flattering for this book","I completely agree with Danyy Langford when he says Dumbledore was killed off unimaginativly, and cannot believe that the potter fans are in denial to the dullness of this book so severly as to give his statement such bad reviews. Open your eyes people!"
1,Malfoy's Rowling's last hope.,"Now that she drove Snape to hell, Malfoy is her, or the series' last hope. The final rating for this book should wait 'till his fate is revealed."
1,Living up to the Promise,"As Ms Rowling promised, her series has indeed become darker and more complex in concept. However, it is the execution of that concept that fails to deliver. As was hinted in the earlier books, adults are not to be trusted. She relies on predictable tactics, such as verifying that all of Harry's suspicions about Snape and Malfoy are 100% correct and by revealing extreme gullibility and false judgements attributed to Dumbledore, Harry's mentor -- even to the final pensieve (very nicely done except for the unsatisfactory results) and ultimate sacrifice at the end of this book. Is it necessary for all good wizards (children) to find out how to think for themselves by losing respect for the wisdom and support of elders? This may set things up nicely for a spectacular 7th finale in which realities may undo some of the damage, but... for the time being, it teaches that even if you are a ""Chosen"" 16 year old wizard, don't trust anyone's wisdom... especially anyone older than 16."
1,I Loved this book (me amor un libra),"This book taught me how to speak spanish in only 8 years! I now speak to my grandson Lucy about his life in Mexico and how to say ""can i go to the bathroom"" (""Puedo ir el bano por favor"") I am an illegal immigrant from California actually but i only knew how to speak Japanese. This i use to communicate w/ my favorite hobo who lives on my block. Spanish readers, This book taught me how to be like you guys. I Love You Expedia! Peace out to all my homies in Japan and Africa!"
2,"Half Blood Prince, Half *** Try","This book was wonderfully disappointing but, after all the trash she has been putting out in the last couple of years, I have to give her credit for being consistent. Another ultimately disappointing try by an author who lacks any depth or meaning in her work. She reminds me of an elephant that zoo keepers gave a brush and a canvass, that scribbles meaningless garbage with on it with paint and then they are able to sell it. The world may have been better off by hiring a chimpanzee to slam his hands repeatedly on a keyboard because at least that way it would have been more coherent and organized. Thanks J.K. Rowling for another book that can take up space on the shelves at the local library instead of the classics that should be there."
2,Harry Potter 6,This book was literary crap. I think that JK Rowling has become a -bit- cocky when it comes to writing novels. Her head has swollen over the success of the books and the films. The stories were not well written. A good fantasy writer makes things easy to almost believe. Rowlings books make me laugh out loud. Don't bother reading this book. It's not worth your time.
2,Harry Farter again?,"I have read the first Harry Farter book because I could no longer stand the hype surrounding it. I won't say it is very bad. . . just good enough to spend the time while waiting for a root canal. And then, of course, came this Half Blood Prince thing and I rushed yesterday to Borders here in Singapore. I need not go past ten pages to realize nothing much has changed in Rowling's writing.In short, I will never understand the big fuss people are heaping on this gigantic heap of trash. Flat, wooden characters, predictable scenes, unabashed copying of Tolkien. People, grow up! Why make do with leftover gruel when there is a perfectly digestible amount of cereals other than this?Sorry to shout about the Empress' new clothes. I just hate people blindlessly cajoled by multi-million dollar book contracts when there are more better written books out there. Start with your local newspaper."
3,"I laughed, I wept, I gripped my seat in terror","It is always best to provide murder and mayhem when running dry of ideas, and Rowling doesn't disappoint us here: Dumbledore biting the magic bullet without benefit of a grassy knoll is one way to air out the staleness (and for those of you confused about magic bullets and grassy knolls, please scratch your heads in puzzlement and continue to the next review). I must admit, however, that I hadn't wept this hard since Rowling made her last $50 million.It would have been more satisfying if the author provided something actually interesting, like, say, a budding romance between Harry and Hagrid, or Hermione's first acid trip. Oh well.I give it three stars. Five, if Harry had blown himself up at the end."
5,Harry Potter,"The Harry Potter series are truly amazing books. J.K. Rowling is an outstanding author. Today I want to discuss Harry Potter and the half blooded prince. In the book Harry, Hermione and Ron go to another year of Hogwarts. Where Hermione, Ron and Malfoy become prefects and Harry does not. It's definitely going to be their hardest year and maybe their lastIf you're for action and adventure this book is for you.WarningNot for the faint hearted"
3,"Entertaining, but dark.","The kids we met in HP1 are growing up, and their world gets a little nastier in each book. This title continues that tradition, and I'm looking forward to the resolution in number seven."
1,Totally out of place,"If she would have added a shrunken head I wouldn't have been surprised. The book fits with the other 5 about as well as the POA movie fits with the first two films, very badly."
2,"Another Fake Rowling, Another Fake Review.","The Truth: Hogwarts ONLY held magic for Harry, his mother Lilly and his father er James did not enjoy Hogwarts and they grew to hate it. Dumbledore was not an orphan and these books all read like they were edited by Tom Clancy.Here is a quote from the Order of the Phoenix: ""One cannot survive while the other lives"".....The REAL quote: ""One can not live while the other one JUST survives"". Do you see the difference?Harry does have to go back into the pensieve and retrieve a memory, however that memory brings back a revelation that his real enemy Voldemort had a helper.... a certain cowardly writer and we all know who that is."
3,What page does the excitement finally begin?,"Wow, are we wading through this book. The kids (now ages 12 and 14) LOVED the first 5 in the series (we read them aloud) and it has taken us months to get through this one! It is dull and exceptionally wordy. We are all highly disappointed!"
4,very surprising ending,Throughoout the entire book I was waiting and waiting with enthusiasm to find out what happens but as i neared the the end of the book i started to realize it wasnt gonna be answered. the ending is very disappointing becuz the author leaves you with millions of questions that will remain unanswered until she feels like writing her next book in the next few years. all that reading for nothing. 652 pgs of mystery for nothin... so you will be left with questions in the end. im upset...very upset at the ending.
1,ewwwwwwwww,"the book is absolutely horibble! I mean come ooon, Ron and Hermione pairing, and Harry+Ginny?! JK Rowling better pull her act together for the last book!"
2,A hard slog,"I labored through half of this book, then finally gave up and asked my son what happens in the rest of the plot. This one just didn't engage me. It seemed so same-old, same-old; Snape with his greasy hair and malevolent gaze, evil Malfoy, awkward Ron, weeping Hagrid, wise and mysterious Dumbledore, blah blah blah. Nothing really clever or surprising. No character development and little plot. Now I see the beauty in trilogies; enough is enough. Rowling has never again come close to the third book, The Prisoner of Azkaban.I doubt I'll want to read the 7th book but I'll be curious as to what happens so I'll read the synopsis on Wikipedia."
4,Chelsi's Review,"I thought that this book was pretty good. I waited a really long time for it to come out. I think that even though this book was more in depth than the rest, it was probably one of the easier books to read from the series. All the experiences that Harry went through seemed real, like I was actually there experiencing it with him. Ron and Hermione make a very cute couple, as do Harry and Ginny. I was sad when Harry broke up with her. The only complaint I had about the book was that Dumbledore dies in the end. I can't wait for the next book and I'm sure it will be even better than the sixth."
4,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Book 6,Have you seen the movies? Compared to the books they are crap. This is possibly my favorite book of the Harry Potter series. If you are a fan then you must read this book.
5,Love the Harry Potter series,I have an hour drive to and from work and love listening to Harry Potter books on CD. These are a definate must for family road trips. You know instead of letting the kids watch movies.
5,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Book Review by Emily Gulley,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is one of the best books I have ever read.I would definitely recommend this book for friends because they usually complain about books being boring, but since the author makes the end of each chapter so intriguing, you just don't want to stop reading.The way J.K. Rowling characterizes people is always funny.For example, ""Pig in a wig"" and ""toad-like face"". Most people would think that the whole thing would be serious and scary, but overall, it's pretty funny. I wouldn't recommend this book for kids younger than eight years old(mostly because of violence),but I hope I can talk all of my friends into reading it."
5,The Chosen One Returns . . .,"Fame is not the only thing that Harry Potter will have to worry about as he trains with Dumbledore. Lord Voldemort's forces are on the move, seeking to dominate the Wizarding world. I enjoy this story because it tells a classic story of an average teenager trying to cope with the burden of fame while struggling with world that is rapidly changing around him. I would recommend this book not only to Harry Potter fans, but also anyone who relishes fantasy, fiction, and coming of age books. A must read that should be introduced to every audience that can relate to the life of an average teenager.The Young Guardians and the Genesis Spell"
3,"Harry Potter, again, again again","Since I am familiar with the plot, I enjoy reading the series; but, it has become a bit repetitive. The first three books were great because the author was still setting up the story, but now that it has been set, it seems she just throws the same thing over and over and it is no longer as fun to read. The ending was quite a surprise and I am looking forward to reading the next book, but really to finish off the series. We will see how bad Prof. Snape really is or isn't . . . not to mention Malfoy."
5,Wonderful,This is one of J.K Rowlings best. The story creates a world around you that is so much more interesting then mine. It was great. The characters evolve even more. Her writing keeps getting more detailed and even more interesting. This is the best book to come out this year.
4,A nice addition,"I would have to say this was not my favorite books in the series so far. It was well written and thought out. The plot and characters are wonderfully developed and there are most definatly thrilling pieces of the book, and yet, sometimes while I was reading I found myself just setting the book down, telling myself I'd come back to it later. I wasn't sure why until I finished the book and I realized that there was more explaining and discovering more about the past rather than taking action about what was happening in the present. I found the pensive chapters, while informative and nessisary, rather dull. I had higher hopes, but of course, not a bad book at all."
3,Entertaining,"That's all I can say: Entertaining. Yes, they hook you. No, the suspense isn't THAT good. But I suppose that is what our world wants now. This sixth book is, I think, up-dates the readers (and Harry) to what is going on. There is much time spent in the pensieve, and the true character of Snape is revealed. Reality is revealed.One thing I find very interesting is Rowling's style. There is much left unexplained, ways that some forms of magic are more powerful (such as much of the Dark Art being devoted to killing and not one mention of how the Order of the Pheonix fights back without using it) and other basic things. But instead of attempting to explain some of them, she just leaves them all be, relying on the faith of the readers to get them through their scepticism. It was much better than making a futile attempt. If she had, the unexplainables would have been all the more shocking.SocraT"
4,A step down from the other potters,"I'd carry this book under my arm, but it's too damn thick. That would be fine if it had a story, but now, it seems like Rowlings is just dragging this on to make the book more expemnsive. I didn't really like how (you know who) dies. Voldemort seems to be getting too old to be keeping him in the story. It doesn't have the same magic that the original ones had because the original ones were meant for children."
3,Could've been better,"Like most others, I definately liked this one better than book 5, but it seems that some of the magic that made the first four books so awesome is gone. Instead of having an equal balance of highs and lows, it seems the lows are heavily outweighing the highs. I'd love to see Harry develop some amazing new never-before-seen talent, or win a fight against the bad guys for a change. So far Dumbledore and Hermione seem to be better and stronger wizards than Harry who gets by on luck most of the time. I guess we have to be patient and wait for book 7 to feel avenged and satisfied with the ending. I sure hope Rowling knocks our socks off with book 7."
2,Disappointed,"I was not impressed with this one. The plot was way too much of a repeat of the previous books, and there were no big suprises. Also, the quidditch is starting to get really old, and the characters seem less believable than they used to be. This book is fine for reading on a plane or something like that, but I expected better."
3,Dark and Gloomy,"Based on the nearly 2500 reviews already written about this book, I'm not going to go into much detail since I'm sure it has been done already.This was a really dark book - I've noticed this trend since #3. To be honest, I didn't really enjoy this one all that much. It has been over two years since she wrote her last one so it was difficult to remember just what happened in the previous book. After waiting so long for the latest book, it finally came and I started reading it with much anticipation. Unfortunately, the anticipation desimated before the end of the book.I'm not saying don't read it... I'm just saying don't set your expectations too high."
4,Hogwarts Again!,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince took me longer than I thought it would to start and finish. I had the book sitting next to my reading chair for a few weeks before I finally picked it up. I enjoyed it immensely, but it wasn't a good a read as I had hoped for."
4,"Great, but I agree, not the best....","This book is great.... I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this book. I can't say enough about all the information that was given. About all the story that was packed between the front and back covers of this wonderful book. My only knock on it were a couple of underdeveloped storylines that would have been better if completely eliminated from the story. But I digress...Ultimately, this is a great story. Second ONLY to Order of the Phoenix. And only SLIGHTLY less appealing. Just a matter of taste I suppose."
4,"Not half bad, pretty good really","1) Not a good book for younger children. I'd recommend they stick to Books 1-3, maybe Book 4.2) Better than Book 5, but not as enjoyable as some of the earlier books to me.3) Definitely getting darker and more depressing as Harry and his compatriots grow older. Of course, the world seems darker and more depressing than it used to be too.4) The Half-Blood Prince is a very interesting character. I look forward to seeing how events tie up in Book 7.5) Book 6 seemed a little short. Some of the other books stood alone better.6) I missed the usual Hogwarts Express ending."
3,Do I stand alone...,"...in believing that this book was lukewarm at best? I thought book 5 was pretty dreadful and this one is only a small improvement. Of course, if you're a Harry Potter fan, you will have to read this. It's not a waste of tiime but it was overly long without saying very much. Let's face it, if there were 15 books in the series, we Harry Potter fans would read all 15, but books 5 & 6, are nowhere near as exciting as the first 4. It's like the dementors sucked the very soul out of books 5 & 6."
2,Not as Good as the Last Two,"The last two installments of the Harry Potter series were excellent. This one is like a mediocre The Empire Strikes Back, a book that contains a lot background and hints of future events, but doesn't hold up well on it's on. At the end, there are too many unanswered questions. At the end of the previous installment in the series, I was sad, but in this installment I was just annoyed. The author seems to have been deceiving us (or maybe it's all just a rouse again) about the nature of key characters in the series. Also, what makes this one lacking is that the final showdown is a bit of a let-down.In general, I don't think the writing is as good in this book. And a lot of the repeated behaviors of certain characters are now starting to feel like the same old, same old stuff. I've really enjoyed previous installments in the series, especially The Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix. To me, the ending of this book was really a disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"JK Rawling has let her readers down. After building up to the exciting and dramatic Order of the Phoenix, this book was flat. I kept waiting for something to happen. Eventually it did, but, that was at the end of the book. There was no suspense and very little action. This book was simply filler between book 5 and book 7.I can practically predict what will happen in book 7 following the conclusion of book 6. I sincerely hope I am wrong and Rawling surprises us all."
1,FIVE WORDS.....,"I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!It is clear J. K. Rowling simply fulfilled her obligation in writing this book!! This series had the potential to be great for many many years to come and for a multitude of generations. Yes her original following has grown up - but they would followed Harry as long as she kept to the original integrity of her charactors or basic plot. I read and enjoyed books 1 thru 5 and I am 45, my daughter devoured them from the time she was ~ 7 till now and she still (or was) a devout fan!This but reads like J.K. Rowling was in a hurry, felt pressure to write, may be she has lost her interest, or may be her gift?! Who knows, I could not finish this book and will not purchase the next...I no longer care about the charactors, I feel I wasted my time reading any of the books!!!!!!!!"
2,The Magic is Gone,"I've loved the Harry Potter series, but this book does not live up to the quality of the others. Each preceding book had new interesting surprises (the Maurader's Map, for example). This book was exceedingly repetitive regarding Malfoy, relationships between boys and girls, and key scenes were just not that exciting. The book does pick up for the final 1/4, but it's as if J.K. Rowling knows how to end the book, but had to throw in one more before book 7. This is clearly the least inspired of them all, and I'm sure in due time more people will agree that the Half-Blood Prince was the most disappointing in this incredible series. Bummer."
2,A placeholder,"While I am attached to the Harry Potter books and respect J.K. Rowling immensely, in the series Book 6 felt like a placeholder in which speculation replaced real conflict and danger. The lack of resolution made it seem more like a set-up for the final book than a story unto itself, a drawback to fitting one's creativity into a rigid seven-year structure. Still, Rowling can write, and when she is allowed to let it all out in the final installment, I will be sad to see it end."
3,Disappointing and Formulaic,"This is first time a Harry Potter book has bored me! It seems to be a collection of answers to Ms. Rowling's e-mails. The great majority of the book is a series of answers to tie up loose ends. OK, now we know more about Voldemort, the Death Eaters and the personal lives of the primary characters, but there was very little room left for an actual plot.The final quarter of the book gets exciting and seems to be making some progress, but then the disappointing ending. Yes, JK makes another kill. It seems each book will have a more gruesome death than the previous one. This one went too far. Ms. Rowling, I have only one thing to say to you, Crucio!I won't be in such a hurry to buy book 7."
3,not so interesting,"Nothing much stands out from this book, no single set piece really grabs....without writing spoilers, the imagination here repeats feelings/images/atmosphere from previous books, notably Prisoner of Azakaban.The characters of Ron and Hermione, well nothing much happens to them apart from Ron being saved by Harry, and Hermione as the righteous conscience is wearing thin, and she's pretty shrill about it.I got the impression that the writer was tired throughout this, there are very few sparks in it all.Draco Malfoy's view in earlier books of Hagrid as an oaf and simpleton proves to be pretty fair, and the Weasley family are revealed to be quite provincial and xenophobic (little Englanders all), although an attempt at redemption towards the end of the book: Mrs Weasley's acceptance of Fleur, is rather flat and contrived and. Fleur is simply a plot device, as are so many other characters in this latest offering."
4,"Good, but the end is rather disappointing....","I loved this book, and everything it encompasses. However, Harry and Ginny breaking up was totally uncalled for. Also, why did Dumbledore have to die? I think JKR is getting bored with writing the Harry Potter series. I am and will always be an avid fan of the HP books, but where as the fifth book was as stunning as the previous four, this one lets down a lot of Harry fans. Please don't come after me for saying it, but I personally hope JKR shapes up her writing for the seventh book in the series."
5,Quick Review,"I thought this book was fantastic. It was certainly better than #4 (Goblet of Fire) and #5 (Order of the Phoenix), and may be the best one to date.I agree with some of the criticisms that the plot may not be really well defined, but it's so full of great background information and character twists that the book is sure to give you a thrill (and a cry)."
5,Five Stars Plus!,"Another wonderful book by J.K. Rowling. And a book for ALL ages: meaning times and people!!!!! I'm in my early thirites and love all the Harry Potter books. This along with H.P. Albarelli's ""The Heap"" and the John Twelve Hawks' book, ""The Traveler"" will make for a good number of wonderful reading days. Enjoy, enjoy: Peace!"
4,Pre-Ordered!,"Harry starts out another year at Hogwarts! Great right? Wrong. Everything makes Harry suspiciuos and he just wont stop! He's looking under every rock, he's getting angry, and he's pushing his limits. And then! He's beating Hermione in Potions with the Half Blood Prince's book! OH THE NERVE! ;) But- Needless to say- I was a bit saddened by the book. It lacked the quality and emotion that the other five books retained. All and all it was good, but I didnt cry over this new death as I had Sirus'. And speaking of this new death!- WHY!?If you have read the other five books, you will enjoy this one, just...dont get your hopes up."
4,Halfway Through,"I didn't think that the Author could continue to think up new things for the protagonist. I apologize. I am only half way through the book, and I am enjoying it."
2,Harry potter and the half blood Prince,I would rate this book as a 5/10 because it is sad. Also Dumbledore dies. I would recommend this book to Mackenzie Larson because her brother likes them too.
3,A Decent Story But Not Rowling's Best,"I have really enjoyed the other books in this series but would have to say this one is the weakest. It seems to go a route that detracts from the previous stories. I think the reason it does, is to match the increasing maturity of the characters. But it doesn't seem to follow smoothly enough from the rest of the series.Overall, a very good read, but I hope the final book returns to its original state of magic."
3,How can this story be wrapped up in only one more book??,"Just a few random thoughts on the subject:I love all the Harry Potter books and I hated the author for killing off another wonderful lead character. Without this character's help, I don't see how Harry could possibly become proficient enough in magic to destroy Lord Voldemort, even if he weakens him by destroying all his horcruxes - especially if he drops out of Hogwarts! But I guess the author will come up with some more lucky twists of wizardry and witchcraft to save Harry's neck...I would really like to know what Dumbledore's reason was for trusting Snape. Was it a mistake? Or were Snape's actions part of Dumbledore's plan?How come that in the final battle Snape could read Harry's mind without Harry noticing?And why did Dumbledore stupefy Harry? Was this also part of the plan?As I said, just some random thoughts..."
3,Weakest of the Series,"The Harry Potter series is masterful, intriguing, fun. The 6th volume, however, is the weakest of the 7. Many of the smaller mysteries seemed contrived to set up for the larger story arc, or seemed to be created backwards from the tie-up to the start of the event.Still and however, Rowling's prose carries the reader along, even when, near the end of the book, the story takes a quick 90-degree turn. And all will be resolved in the final volume. I have faith."
3,Ending Didn't Feel Right,"I am a confirmed Harry Potter fan. I've purchased all the books and reread most of them. Since I teach Special Ed at the high school level, I've found that my students enjoy Harry Potter. I can actually get them to read the Potter books and ""get into them.""I enjoyed this book up until the end. The ending felt artificial and totally unnecessary. Without spoiling the book for anyone, the death of this character didn't add up to how the character is portrayed in the previous books.Also, I have a feeling Rowling wants to extend Harry Potter beyond the seven books once promised. She seems to be sending Harry on an extended quest to pursue Voldemort for maybe ten years.Although I enjoyed reading about the characters I've grown to love--Harry, Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys--I felt this story was a bit contrived and not up to standard.Sorry, J.K."
2,Depreciation isn't just for cars...,"Apparently Rowling has forgotten how to write since the release of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"". Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was poorly written and low on action. The book was obviously written to organize plot lines for the finale. Unfortunatley this was done with little finesse. Tokien in his epic managed to weave plot lines without the forced feeling that a reader finds in HBP, so Rowling falls short of the comparisons made between the two. The dialougue between characters is often wooden or overly prentenious... apparently Rowling has forgotten how teenagers behave as well. The numerous romances seemed bland, with a few exceptions. A lot of the characters regressed and instead of gaining depth became more shallow and two dimensional. Overall the book seems to represent a decline in standards. Rowling failed to focus on book six and seemed to be focussed on book seven. This caused Half-Blood Prince to be a poor read and hardly exciting."
4,A great read,Awesome story and cliffhanger. I can not wait to read the next novel. I think this is the best one in the series.
5,Best Book EVER (the other 6 are too).,"To be honest, this is my favorite of all the Harry Potter's. In my opinion the most happens in this book and there is a little bit more Romance than the others. :)"
5,excellent,these cds make the harry potter series so much better. they are able to launch you more into the story and feel like you are actually witnessing it as if it was right infront of your eyes. worth the money
5,good to read,"I'm a fan of this series from Thailand so I' ve just scan it for my report but I think this book is very good because of this reasons. First, this book still have jokes that I can understand although I'm not a good English student. Second, J.K. gives me information that I want to know[ but creats more secrets,too]. Third,J.K. 's ideas always makes me surprise [e.g.Horcrux, The meaning of prince]. However, the ""Half-Blood Prince"" is not as good as I expect because, for me this book is quite a thriller story[ that i don,t want to assume like this when i read the goblet of fire]."
3,WHat the F@#% JK,"First of I know that every person in the world has read this book by now. That said I would like to comly ask miss Rowling to but done the mashedy and stop killing her beloved carictures. (Please stop reading this if you havent read the book yet). Why O why did you kill Dumbeldore are you insaine? And ferther more where do you think your going with this, a Harry Potter book without Hogwartz why are you doing this to us why why why. I supose it dosent matter to you, you don't need the last book to sell big ( althopugh Im perfictly awre it will) you couled just sit back and never write agine couldint you. Love all your books but you took it to far this time your just hurting your fans know. and for what just fun I suppose :("
3,Satisfactory but lacking in comparison,"I was so excited about reading this book! It started of so well and helped explain many things missing from the previous five. Including more information that goes along with the Chamber of Secrets. However, this book upon reading it was extremely predictable and the foreshadowing was too blatently obvious. It did however, set up a good transition for the seventh book, which if done properly could be the best. I rate this book as the fourth best in the series, with Goblet of Fire next and Order of the Phoenix being the best thus far."
5,Awesome!,"I was surprised by the ending, saddened, and left totally amazed. This is a great book that continues the tradition. I got it at midnight, read it immediately, and slept away the rest of today. Totally worth it! -Syd Salsman (daughter)"
5,another great book,"Book six is a great read. Harry and his friends embark on a new year at Hogwarts. Their sixth year is amazingly challenging as they struggle with their studies, Harry's never ending suspicion of Malfoy, and the love lives of all three friends. They face their challenges with actions relatively predictable of their characters.This book was a pretty good piece of writing. It may very will be my favorite of the series. That being said, if you need continual suspense, it may not be the greatest. There's a lot of building up. The end is really exciting. The ending was a little hokey to me, but overall, it was a great book. There were laughs and there was a great deal of anger at some of the characters. It's a great read."
2,Least Enjoyable Harry Potter book!,"I have been a fan of Harry Potter, but I gotta say, this book is not at all worth reading.Quite honestly, the story goes nowhere. And there is too much teenage romance thrown in!! gimmi a break.A lot of things could have been covered in a lot less words. The book is just TOO-SLOW.I am truly amazed at all the positive reviews. I recommend you ask the basic outline of the story from someone who has read the book. I am sure you will go to everything in 2mins. And then you could read up the previous books, because the rest of the things such as Quidittch matches, lectures, romances, spells, professors can be found in the previous ones."
3,Better than the last but certainly not the best,"After the fifth book, which bored me to death in the first hundred pages and fizzled out badly at the end, I was a bit anxious as to whether Rowling was running out of steam with the saga. But in this book she is largely back on form. The book is still too long though with more padding than is needed. And I just don't buy the Harry/Ginny thing at all. Uck!"
5,The best series EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,This is now the third time I am reading this book because it is awesome read Harry Potter 6 you won't regret it
4,"Plodding, then has a knock-out climax","Overall, this book is very good effort by JK Rowling, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it isn't her best effort in the series.As with the other books, Rowling has created an outstanding climax, full of action, revealing the key plot twists, and offering the cliffhangers for the final book.Unfortunately, it seems to take a long time to get there. Some of the earlier chapters seem to drag. And I find myself occasionally annoyed when Rowling throws in a trivial bit of an event that happened in a prior book, but the mention of which seems to have little relevance to this book's plot. Like other Harry Potter fans, I find the world that she has created, with its carefully crafted details and clever designs, is fascinating, but I don't see the the need to keep repeating it in this book.I think that tightening up the middle of the book would have gone a long way with improving its pace and making the climb to the climax less of a chore."
5,JK is amazing,I was so angry at first about the events in this book. But the more I thought and read I realized JK has us right where she wants us! I love wondering what is REALLY what and trying to decipher her well hidden clues. My only gripe is that I feel this book is half of a whole...part one of a two parter...and that being the case it is very frustrating to have to wait so very long for part 2...last book or not!
4,Better than book 5,I feel that the half blood prince is better in terms of storyline as compared to order of Phoenix. Its well written. The end is a bit of a dampener though- also one gets the feeling that due to the roaring commercial success of the book- the author is preparing the readers for the fact that there may be more than seven books in the offing.In any case the book has had the usual impact- cannot wait to get hold of the seventh title.
4,A MUST READ!! It keeps your blood boiling! 4 1/2 stars!!!!,"This book is truly a great book but the only problem is in the book you can't believe some one would do a certain thing or believe something that would be best kept a secret!!! It is a great book and the only other turndown is how short it is. The fifth book was fun to read because it just kept going on and on. I thought for sure that this book would be even longer because every book the length is atleast a little bit longer. But besides those... GO OUT AND GET THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T!!! ITS SO MUCH FUN TO READ! and of course we must remember (sigh/roll eyes) that this book will be great in theaters! BUT i recommend for EVERYONE, if they haven't already read the other ones, to READ THEM! THEN go and see the movie! But of course read them even if the movie isn't out yet or out for a while! You're going to love this book! I assure you! HARRY POTTER IS THE BEST!!!-THE HARRY POTTER FANATIC!!!"
5,The Book That Must Be Read,"Again, a trip to the world of Harry Potter does not dissapoint. Rowling is truly a gifted writer; why else would I, a 35 year old, wait anxiously for my ""Amazoned"" copy? Finally, the relationships develop and give hope to the next generation of wizards and witches, Harry matures as he grieves for Sirius, and the inevitabilities come crashing down. I sense a greater twist for the next book, but until then I will guess, incorrectly, I suppose, at what it will give us. I am so saddened now, because of the end of this twisted tale and because the wait begins again.What a treat these books will be for readers for many, many years to come."
4,Touching.,"J.K. Rowling is a wonderful children's author, she does a good job writing these books. I finished this one soon after I got it, and am looking forward to the next one in the series. All of 652 heart-racing pages, you can say that you get what you pay for. Quite the deal."
4,Harry and the Half Blood Prince,"I have enjoyed all of the Harry POTTER books in the series. However, this sixth one seemed to use a lot of fillers, ie. the group growing up, on and on ............ I didn't enjoy this one as much as the previous ones which had marvelous characters for Harry to overcome, or befriend. I kept waiting for the climax and never found it. I just hope the series ends with lots of fireworks."
5,"Wonderful book, best of the series.","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this. Next to the Sorcerer's Stone the best book in the series. The 6th years at hogwarts have definately grown up and are almost completely different characters from the first books.I highly recomend this book, the cliffhanger at the end has got me wondering if I'll be able to wait for the last book."
5,Only five stars?,Mrs. Rowling is in top form on this book. My favorite used to be Goblet of Fire. I read Half-Blood Prince in one sitting and I'm going back to read it again immediately. Powerful and Wonderful. Continues the story with all the intensity of being sixteen (again). Don't want to say more because I don't want to be a spoiler. I read on Amazon that Mrs. Rowling will always be writing something. Thank Goodness--it means I will always have something wonderful to read.
4,Great but slightly disappointing,"I read this book in one day, and I had spent the week before reading parts of Book 5, where I beleived some crucial clues to Book Six were. The first five books seemed to me to progress in some kind of coherent pattern, as if the author had the whole set written in her head up to that point. This book however, seems as if it was almost written by someone else. Almost all of the questions that came up in book 5 were either not answered or rendered moot by this completely new path the series has taken. I enjoyed the book but I have to say that the ending was a disappointment to me and I do not see how every lose end can be tied up in one final book."
3,the first stumble,"This book in the wonderful Harry Potter series is the first I have not read several times -- or even twice. Why not, I wonder? There are no new intriguing characters -- a common characteristic of all previous books. And Dumbledore, taking center stage, is rather a bore -- he was wonderful as a presence on the outside, but, like a superb character actor given a lead, he's just in the wrong spot. SPOILER ALERT, stop here if you haven't yet read it.Bothersome too is the C.S.Lewis-like martyr conclusion: as if this is Narnia. Most intriguing is the potential legacy of Sirius's brother, and maybe that seeds neat unfoldings in the final book. We will see.This book is recommended, simply because it is Harry Potter and all Harry Potter deserves to be read. But it is the weakest in the series."
4,A solid entry to the series but more detail please!,"I'll try to write this review without spoilers (difficult!). This novel is closer to Chamber of Secrets or Prisoner of Azkaban than it is to Order of the Phoenix or Goblet of Fire, and I liked that. It focuses more on the trio without introducing numerous new characters. You find out some interesting backstory (though not about James and Lily, which is what I was hoping for), get a little romance (though not fleshed out enough in my opinion) and the typical Harry Potter mystery/quest portion. The book could have been edited a bit better (remove the first few chapters about the impact on the muggle world and flesh out some of the relationships more) but that's a minor quibble. A very enjoyable read, but I don't know how she's going to wrap the series up in under 1200 pages--lots of questions remain unanswered!"
4,Excellento !!! Aggrievo ........,An excellent lineup to the series.....But troublesome in its darkness....Great twists and turns coupled with constant bickering and menace.....rowling has done a really good work with the book (but the prince doesnot measure up to the grandeur of the goblet of fire).....
5,Brillant and Magical,"Yet again, J.K Rowling writes a novel of immense satisfaction. I was hooked from the moment it was placed in my hands and I promise you will be too. Her attention to detail and storytelling make Harry's 6th adventure come alive. So many questions came to my mind after the final page, that I'm positive that Book 7 will be larger than the dictionary, but if it's as good as Book 6 then there won't be a problem.One more thing-It's a good idea to read the book twice through to fully appreciate and get the most out of the story."
4,i can't believe it!!,"I loved the book up until Harry and Dumbledore get to the ""Voldemort cave"" because it just gets creepier from there. I can't believe Snape killed Dumbledore, but it does sort of make sense because Snape is one of the only two death eaters in the castle [Snape and Malfoy]. So now, however, I am not so keen to read the next book because Dumbledore and Sirius are gone, Fred and George are gone [I love their shop] and because Dumbledore weakened himself to death for a fake horcrux. Also I am afraid that in the last book Harry will die with Tom [Voldemort] because their wands share a core, and I think that is a connection so I really had trouble rating the book."
3,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,I liked the book very much but there wasn't as much excitment in volved in it as before. I am looking for to the next book. We have to get him out of school Right?
5,Awesome,"This book, will really make you sad. J.K. Rowling really did a good job with this one, and sucks the reader in. Well worth the money."
5,Excellent!,This Harry Potter was very good. I've liked them all except #5 but this one is right back up there and better than all the others. I think her writing has gotten more complex. Really great!!
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I read it in 3 days (less than actually) because I couldnt stop reading! Harry Potter books are my favorite in the world. The 6th was actually a bit intense and VERY sad, but I LOVED it! I dont care if u think HPs will be stupid, read them and I GUARENTEE u will LOVE them! NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE!"
2,An enchanting disturbance.,"I have been I fan of harry potter from a long time.I loved the harry potter books 1-3 the most,but then I saw a weird pattern...they say that harry potter is for people 10 and up,but I must say that harry potter 4-6 was very disturbing and I have no idea how they are going to make these into a rated PG movie.so parents should read these before handing them to a child.I have read harry potter 6 all the way through,and now I know what the pope was talking about.Not only that but the story is a bit rushed,and I did not like the end of the book,in fact,even if the book was not as disturbing as it was,I would not read harry potter book seven.so all and all Harry potter set a new record for jumping the shark."
3,HARRY FINDS A PENPAL,"I have to admit, Harry Potter has wowed me, and intrigued me, and I have enjoyed them immensely, I have nothing but admiration for J.K. Rowling and her most intriguing creations. I have also found another author and a new series with characters that Harry could be penpals with! A Monumental Journey, by author Richard L Cederberg. Fans of Harry . . . meet Gabriel Baaldur Proudmore and Garrett. You will love these books! ALL AGES ... really!"
5,Harry Potter,It appears that this book is even better than the others. We have all of the Potter books and enjoy reading them for the second time.
5,Rowling has outdone herself,"As wonderful as the earlier installments of this series have been, the Half-Blood Prince is by far the most complex and well-written volume. I can't wait for the final book to be released!"
5,Emotional rollercoaster and well worth the wait,"Okay, I admit it, I'm a 48 year old woman who LOVES Harry Potter and rushed to get my book on Saturday morning! Book 6 ranks at the top of my favorites now (a nice change from the darkness of Book 5), though I was brought to tears at the vision of Hagrid carrying Dumbledore's body to be laid to rest. I laughed at the teenagers; actually felt a bit of pity for Malfoy; was left wondering yet again about what's left of the Snape saga....and remembered that the pictures in the Headmaster's office can talk, so this isn't really the end of what Albus Dumbledoor has to say, right? The book answered a lot of questions and gave us many more to think about until we are rewarded with Book 7. JK, can't you find it in your heart to try a Book 8??? :) Thanks again for sharing your marvelous imagination with the rest of us!"
1,Scared the bejeebers out of me!!!!,"This must be the scariest book ever written! It scared the bejeebers out of me! I had nightmares for months!!!!!! It has snakes, big spiders, mean spells, and zombies!!!!! Must I say anymore???DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT THE BEJEEBERS SCARED OUT OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,To be honest....a little disappointing,"As I was reading this series it seemed that each book was more enthralling, more unputdownable than the one that preceeded it. At least I thought so, until I read this one.Upon purchasing the book, I was surprised at how thin it was (at least in comparison to the last two). While it is still undeniably good, and still hard to put down, it seems like it is/was rushed, like many parts were hastily glossed over, and it could have had so much more in it, it could have been so much better.I'm not going to post any spoilers, but I was also disappointed in the ending which was, like the rest of the book, lacking, that is, it was good but it could have been so much better. I find myself hoping that this was done only to set the stage for the last book in the series. Hopefully, that will be a finale worth waiting for."
3,Rowling Falls Short of Her Usual Standard,"This book was good except for several things that were completely useless to the plot that made parts of it not so interesting to read. Some parts such as a whole bunch of teenagers deciding to get flirty does not help the story for the last book. The parts with Dumbledore, Malfoy, and Snape could be considdered good parts of the story. The story also gives me the impression that it was written in a rush because she does not go into as many details with the images and events of the story. These details were part of what made the story fun to read. I can pick up any other Harry Potter book and finish it in a day if I want to, even number 5 which was cosidderably longer than this one. The Half Blood Prince took me 2 weeks. It was just a lot less fun to read than all the other books have been."
5,Loved It,"I'm a teacher and a mother, and I can't wait to read all of these books with my daughter when she is old enough! I love anything that can get kids to read, and this series is amazingly successful at getting kids to read. As a teacher, I see a real increase in kids wanting to create their own wonderfully imaginative stories, and I believe that sensation is a direct effect of books like the Harry Potter series. LOVE IT!"
5,Great Story!,"In this book J.K. Rowling has returned to her old form. Unlike The Order of the Phoenix, The Half-Blood Prince moves along at a good pace. It finally tells the reader how Voldemort went an orphan to the greatest force for evil the world of Harry Potter has ever seen. It nicely the course that Harry must take to finally defeat his arch-enemy. It also leaves some questions that make the reader look forward to the final installment. J.K. Rowling at her best."
5,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Fabulous!!! Jim Dale exquisitely performs each character in his usual spell-binding fashion. He fully brings out the magic in J.K. Rowling's work.
1,NOT FOR 9-12 YEAR OLDS,"As a mother, I wanted to read this book before handing it over to my 9 year old (who has read the first 5, as well as myself). I can honestly say that she won't be allowed to read it any time soon. I will tell her basically what happens and who the Half-Blood Prince is and such to save her the agony of longing to know what happens next, but it is too dark for her to read at this tender age. It is VERY dark (more so than #4 and #5), and also talks about teenage urges that I'd rather not have my 9 year old worrying about just yet. The werewolf stuff is really savage, as well as the Inferie (sp?). The betrayal and then death is also very devastating. I just don't think that 9 - 12 year olds should go through that emotional roller coaster, and be exposed to such darkness in Harry Potter's world at this point. This book would be OK for about ages 15 and up."
2,Highly disappointing,"Just finished reading this book and only if you (like millions other people) continue to read the series - read it, otherwise it's waste of time. It's clearly miidle-of-the series book (well almost-the-end-book may be if rumors are right). Not too much action, very much water, most characters are two-dimentional. I've read this book in two evenings - much less than other five...Half-Blood Prince mistery is not mistery at all - you read and see...Still, Rowlings writes quite well - so two stars are only for that, but she really needs improvement for a finale..."
1,This book is junk.,"The characters that she developed so well in the previous books were simply not themselves. There really did not seem to be a plot until about 500 pages into the book...until then it was just some kids I hadn't read about in the previous books going to school and having relationship problems. After that the storyline was unbelievably forced. If book 7 is this bad, children and adults everywhere might just give up on reading."
1,illeagal?,No way this is a Legal Version of the book. Rowling is a total bit.... Witch when it comes to ebooks.
4,Great addition to the series!,"Unlike several of the other reviews - I am going to refrain from sprinkling spoilers throughout my review.Read this one in a weekend - and enjoyed it thoroughly.I have to report there is much less whining by Harry Potter than in #5 - much to my relief.This book pushes the story ahead more efficiently than the others... however it does so without the charming side plots featured in the other books (the comic relief) - the main side plot in this one involves evidence of the main characters maturing and developing other interests. In #5 my favorite side bit was George & Fred's development of their various joke candies, etc. It was a great long set up to a gloriously funny chaotic scene. That funny element really isn't present in this book.This one is slightly darker than the last - definitely more mature. I eagerly await the final book!If you want to continue reading reviews - I warn you to be careful as you progress - loads of SPOILERS below!"
3,Feeling unfufilled,"While I enjoyed seeing what Harry & his friends were up to in year 6 at Hogwarts, it was a frustrating experience. It felt as if nothing much of importance happened for a book 600 pages long. It also seems to me that this whole book was nothing more than just a set up for the next book. I agree with another reviewer that OotP & PoA are much better books. Harry's romance is a joke & Ron's PDAs are hard to swallow. At least Harry doesn't just yell at everyone like in the last book."
5,One of the best out of the extraordinary series...,"This book is amazing, to put it plainly. I read it in six hours flat, I couldn't put it down. While Prisoner of Azkaban still remains my favorite, Half Blood Prince runs a very tight second. The whole of the book is very different from the first five, but very entertaining. Harry and his peers grow up a lot more in this book, and learn new things that help them through the year. While HBP answers a lot of questions, it also asks a lot. I can't wait til the 7th installment comes out- but I'm also sad that the series is coming to and end.J.K. Rowling is the best author ever. She's truly talented."
2,Is This An Example of Writer's Block?,"Easily this is one of the worst Harry Potter books. Easily the first five hundred pages could be cut. The first three books in the Potter series were enchanting...what happened? The magical and delicious writing has turned into a dizzying and boring series of silly teenage ""gasp"" omg's strung together to make a book. J.K. Rowling where are you??"
4,Set Up?,"Is it just me or does anyone else feel like the whole of this story was an elaborate set up from beginning to end? Maybe it's just wishful think on my part, but I guess we'll never really know until the end.This was a good book but it follows along the lines of book 5 and just continues to get darker. It still made me laugh at times, but at the end (once again) I was in shock and about ready to cry. We can only hope that the final book in this series will redeem what (who) we lost in this book. Because the final conclusions just don't feel quite right."
2,Longwinded and poorly edited,"Rowling's writing is going downhill--that, or her editors have put her on such a high pedestal that they don't feel as though they have the right to edit her work anymore, which is NOT good. Book 1 was FABULOUS because the editors hacked away everything except that which was necessary--EVERY little detail came full circle in the end; there was no extraneous nonliterary mumblegoo. 'Tis not the case with her most recent books, particularly this one, which had absolutely zero resolution in it. Save for the fact it has a cover and numbered pages, it can hardly qualify as a book. If you're a Potter fan and you haven't read book 6 yet, wait until book 7 is available. Books 6 and 7 apparently will be functioning as one story as far as plot, climax, and resolution are concerned."
5,and the end draws near...,"This is a much darker, more mature book. By the end, schoolyard pranks are playing a backseat and the gang learns what it means to put friendship and loyalty ahead of everything else.Harry, Ron and Hermione are growing up before our eyes.This book grabbed hold and did not let up. It is more than just a kid's book (for anyone who has been living in a cave these last few years). It deals with human emotions and the trials of growing up. That's what makes it such a great story... it's more than magic, witchcraft and wizardry..."
3,Harry Potter continues,"As an avid reader of J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series, I of course read this book the day it came out. I think that the ending will cause mixed reactions. I also was a bit suprised at the use of a few curse words, and the amount of kissing that took place in the story. Though the characters are aging in the story, the reading level is still based on 9 to 12 years. In my opinion the story is maturing too much for that age group. Also, the book has an eerie sense (as the others have), and I even got scared a few times. All together, the book was not my favorite in the series; as it seemed to totally change the direction of the story. I will be sad to read book 7, but hopefully will be more satisfied with it's ending and closing of the series."
2,Harry in confused times,"Just finished the last book. As some reviews rightly pointed this book needed serious editing. Lot of snogging and very little actual stuff. And please the journey to the cave and the BOAT!! it felt like I am watching some very old contrived horror movie and drinking unknown stuff and dumbledore going crazy and finally dying. I was so confused and so thoroughly disappointed by the plot twist that it was unbelievable. And Snape killing dumbledore its pretty obvious there will be some serious twists in the next novel very obvious. Harry falling in love with Ginny! and yes the very spidermannish finish Yuk, its nice to have some light stuff in an otherwise bleak novel but this was just too much. Jealousy snogging and parties felt very little magical mostly haphazard. Still looking forward to the last book something like the Matrix started out really strong right now I feel as if I watched the second movie."
5,Worth the Wait,"Fantastic! Harry, Ron and Hermione are all growing up, and Rowling does such a great job of presenting them as teenagers. The story does not disappoint. As always, the characters are well-developed, and the writing is good. Can't wait for Book 7!"
4,Excellent but Sad,"In keeping with the trend started in Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter continues to travel down his dark course. It is almost impossible to review The Half Blood Prince with out revealing it two major major questions: Who is the Half Blood Prince? and Who will Die?.We continue to doubt Snape, and watch Harry experience a more mature relationship and see him enjoy what may be his last year at Hogworths.All through the book, you feel a sense of the growing dread and fear in the Wizarding comunity and Hogsworth cannot continue to be a safe haven for the youth of the Wizarding World.This book is definetly not for the youngest readers, but for all of us that have watched the series mature from book to book, it is a worthy addition to the series and has haunted me since I read it."
4,We'll Miss you-I'm not spoiling it,"I thought this was a good book, certainly well written and didn't take a long for me to go through. It pretty much sets the stage for Harry to do what he needs to do to save the world.Five is still my hands down favorite.He finally asks the right person out, somebody shows their true colors, and somebody finally gets their Dream Job. I am not sure if the turn coat is actually a turn coat, but it will be interesting to see. Okay, I want seven!!!"
2,Actually and Unfortunately Disappointed,"I was DYING to read this book and on the edge of my seat waiting for it to get here, for Sirius death to be validated and for us to advance in the plot. But I was disappointed. Though the plot advanced majorly, Sirius' death was NOT validated. I love the way COS was woven in and the use of the pensieve and Dumbledore finally being open with Harry, but the romance and predictability of the story really tore it down. It seems as if some of the plot was taken from horribly written fanfiction stories.The book really looks as if it has changed from a great fantasy story to a more media charged novel. With the movies and all the media hype, maybe Rowling has been blindsided.I love Rowling and the Harry Potter series, but I'm most definately disappointed. This book isn't horrible, but is has left me wondering how book 7 will turn out."
3,"Average, but not the best","I was somewhat underwhelmed by this book, given the enormous buildup surrounding it. It was good, but not close to being the best book in the series. To me, that doesn't portend well for the final installment.Book #3, Prisoner of Azkhaban was by far the best book. Its been downhill since then. Hopefully Rowling can blow all our doors off with book #7."
3,SO-SO,It severly lacked any magic. It had all the earmarks of a book that the publisher demanded to be published now. Entirely lacking in suspense or mystery. Too many big words for kids too.
5,"Awesome, exciting, and an emotional roller coster.","Harry Potter's sixth installment is the best novel so far in the series. The love stories, and the back history of Tom Riddle kept me deep into the story until the very end. I did not move for hours. This book leaves a lot to be answered in the 7th novel, and I cannot wait for it to be finished. I highly recomend the recorded version by Jim Dale if you don't have time to read. He brings a whole life to the novel that completes the effect of J. K. Rowling's majical imagination."
4,Great Book,"When I first got it, I didn't read it at first. I was in the middle of my annual re-reading of Lord of the Rings. Then, I read to read all thiis crap for the summer reading crap that I had to do for school.When I was finally able to read it, I read it in a day. Well, I guess it doesn't count as reading it in a day if you finish at 3:00 A.M.This was a great book. I'm not sure what my favorite is. But this was very good. Sorcerer's Stone was good as the first one, but the story has matured a lot since then. Chamber of Secrets was allright. Prisoner of Azkaban was great. Goblet of Fire was long and tedious. I don't really remember much about it. Order of the Phoenix was good. It was certainly more exciting than Goblet of Fire.All of them (except Prisoner of Azkaban) pale in comparison to this. The writing was much better than the other ones (except Prisoner of Azkaban). The story was also so much better (except, well you know the routine).After this, I'm really looking forward to next one."
2,a bit disappointing,"I was riveted by the prior books. fresh and creative , surprising.This one felt formulaic and at times so predictable and needed some good editing.I know it must be hard to keep the intensity up when success is pressuring you but, JK, let us wait for your inspiration rather than be bored, and disappointed!It was quite sad that Albus Dumblesore presumably dies but the book needed to give his death more meaning or hint at it having more meaning.It appeared senseless and from a story point of view a bit desperate. is the story falling apart? what's the real point here? Harry's character is becoming a bit thin and flat as well, a bit of a cartoon . Still and all this was a decent summer read and I couldn't put it down until I knew the ending."
5,Want another treat? Listen to the CD,"Enough said about the storyline. This is a quick review of the CD. If you've read the book, treat yourself to listening to the CD. Read by Jim Dale, you will be entertained by the voices of all your favorite characters. Jim Dale really has a talent for coming up with different accents to match the characters.It is like reading another book!Here is a caution, however. If listening when you are driving, you may find yourself sitting in the driveway, just listening. Warn your family that you are not avoiding them!"
2,Big Disappointment . . . Don't waste your $,"I've read the 5 preceding books and was really looking forward to this installment. However, I would not recommend it and struggled along through some very dull text in the middle section to even finish it. There is very little action, no real spells gone wrong, mysterious adventures in the castle, or in town, and frankly a whole lot of NOTHING. The main characters have become teens, so there is some drivel about who has a crush on whom, but it seemed irrelevant to the story. Several of the characters we have been introduced to so far seemed to play only minor roles in the story line (ie Hagrid, Professor McGonnall). And in the final battle, they killed off a very popular character (who I won't name here), but I'm sure the loss will disappoint many fans. I won't be getting book 7. I would prefer to remember this as an amusing series, and hope that I will forget the disappointment of book 6 in time."
1,failed,I did not receive this book. I got an email several days after my order stating that the person could not find the book.
3,Came 3 day late.,I was dissappointed with the shipping of this item because it would have been faster just to wait until the release date and buy the book at Target.
5,the half-blood price is a full blood thriller,"I thought this is the best books J.K Rowlings has put out in a while. This book had alot of surprises and twists, such as when dumbledore is killed. The scale only allows me to go to 5, but i give it a 7 out of 5. Bravo, J.K. Rowlings, bravo."
1,Harry Potter Tapes,"When my wife plays the tapes they skip in places. We have tried different players and that didn't help, they still skiped."
3,Disappointing! This book leaves you really hanging...,I just finished the book and am quite disappointed. To me the book is written like a movie script this time. I could just imagine how they would present the scenes in Hollywood fashion. And this is the first time that we have been totally left hanging. Who is R.A.B.? What good will come of this terrible murder? I felt at the end like I was watching a soap opera and not reading Rowling.You cannot say the book was bad though. The writing of J.K. Rowling is still tip-top - it's just in comparison with other books she has written... disappointing.
3,Disappointed,I have to say that I am severely disappointed with the path that JK Rowling has taken with book 6 of her promised 7. I writing style and some of the plot turns were out of context with the previous books. It seems as though Rowling is trying to gloss over some aspects and just reach the end of Harry Potter.
4,Amazing. The best book yet.,"This is definately my favorite book in the series. Rowling outdid herself this time. She, as always keeps the reader guessing what is going to happen until the end then leaves a cliffhanger. A great addition to the series."
1,Stephen Fry version of Audio CD almost 200 bucks!,"This review is not for Harry, it's for the shmucks who are selling the British version of the audio book at such a disgusting price. I have listened to books 1-5 read by Stephen Fry, purchased at a reasonable price in Europe (EUR 30 to EUR 50), only to come back and find all the American versions read by Jim Dale. Sorry, but 20 seconds of Dale was like nails on a blackboard compared to Fry. As of December 26, 2011, Amazon's price for Fry's version of Half-Blood Prince is a whopping $199.00! Does Stephen Fry come to my house and read it to me personally? Why is it so expensive? I'll have to have a friend ship me a copy from Europe unless someone out there wants to sell me their British CDs. Anyone?"
4,Are these books seconds!?!Or..UPDATE!,"Ordered my nephew the following book:Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6) [Paperback]By: J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPréCondition: NewSold by: Amazon.com, LLCReceived this email from my sister in law today:""Did you order Tyler's book from Amazon? If so do you have your invoice number or email from them you could forward..He is one page 516 and suddenly it goes upside down and skips a chapter. I want to see if Amazon will send him a new one.""Hopefully Amazon will make good on this when she contacts them!UPDATE: WOW! Thank you Amazon! Theyve just sent my nephew a new book-no charge!!! VERY much appreciated!!!!!!"
3,Good but not described completely,"This was another great book from J.K. Rowling and I was looking for a hardbound copy. There were several listed and I chose one of the many. This one arrived almost a month after placing the order and while the dustcover was in almost new condition, the top of the closed book had cola spills all over the top of the pages and several were absorbed down the pages. While it didn't interfere with the reading, I am certain had I read there were cola watermarks I would probably have purchased from someone else."
3,Good Story horrible Book,"The Harry Potter book (story) is, as everyone knows, fantastic. But the hardcover book itself is a crappy piece that would have been better off printed in paperback.It doesn't help that I was sent a used library copy."
5,My favorite of the 7,"I loved every minute of this book, even the ones that made me cry. This is my favorite of the Harry Potter novels, for the glimpse it gives into how You-Know-Who came to be, and how to best defeat him. Loved, loved, loved it (all 15 times I've read it!)"
5,Amazing!!!!!,Jim Dale is a marvel. This book along with the previous 5 have been nothing short of astonding! Jim Dale is the best choise for the reading. There are over 60 diffrent characters in this novel and he does a diffrent sounding voice for each and ever one.Do yourself a favor and give this a listen!
4,"Mediocre Start, Superb Ending...Mature Subject Matter","First, let me say that this was an entertaining book. The final 200 pages of this make for a great read with secrets revealed, action aplenty, and a great set-up for what will be the final book in the septology. The first 450 pages were entertaining, and filled with lots of characterization and romance, but were sorely lacking in thrills and action.NOTE:My 9-year old son devoured the first five books in the series earlier this year. He started to read this book and lost interest before finishing the first four chapters. ""Dad, is there any fighting?"" he asked. I also think the death of _______________ and the other characters' reactions to the situation would have gone right over his head. When he picks up the book again in five years to reread it, I am hopeful he will more fully appreciate Rowling's excellent handling of the characters and situations."
4,"Wonderful, yet devastating!","As usual I simply could not put the book down! Rowling's depth into the past of Voldemort was genius and interesting. Harry's new discoveries and growth in this book can only keep us on the edge of our seats begging for the next book to come out. I loved this book, but Prisoner of Azkaban is still my favorite. And although the last three chapters of Half Blood Prince left me crying and devestated, I loved the story and am just as anxious for the final book as I was for this one."
5,harry potter/half blood prince,haven't read it yey. L-O-V-E the HP series. Am reading 5 over again before I start the sixth book. Want the experience to last as long as I can.Read books 1-4 over again when I got the fifth one.Kudos kudos and more kudos to Ms. Rowling!
3,Harry Potter is becoming Anakin Skywalker,"I would not tell you the story like others have, please be careful with some other spoiler reviews.I just wanted to say that I did not enjoy this book as much as the previous ones, why? Well, because this Harry Potter is a vengeful resented boy that does not respect his family nor his teachers, hi disrespects the government and sometimes even his friends. I think that a young adult reading this book may misinterpret what is acting in favor of a greater good and what is acting in favor of revenge, resentment and hatred.Oh, yes, this Harry is so full of hatred that is going to become a Sith Lord pretty soon."
3,Not Satisfied,"What a disappointment!!!!! I've found J.K Rowlings first 5 books amazing. But for me was a very huge disappointment at the end.The books leaves you with more questions, and it doesn't answer any . Many of the characters have very dull participation in the book. What about D.A. how come they didn't get together anymore in spite The Dark lord has reappeared.What importance in the book had tha Harry inherit everything from Sirius If he doesn't do anything of importance with it.Honestly with all my respect for miss Rowling and her previous work I really expected more.Also, I really hope the seventh book will be much better . Please Miss Rowling, forget about the commercial success the series has been and write an end of the series that people will comment for years, for me Harry Potter series could be the Star Wars Trilogy of this generation and more."
5,eloquent and endlessly entertaining,I could hardly put this book down. I would go as far as to say that this was the best one yet. Rowling's imagination knows no bounds. Read it! ;)
2,B-o-r-i-n-g!!!,"The sixth book in the wildly popular ""Harry Potter"" series drags along, and seems like the diary of an old lady. No action whatsover. Now, don't get me wrong, I am a die hard HP fan. This book just didn't justify my expectations.Dumbledore applauds himself for every acheivment, while we plod through pages and pages and pages and pages and pages of silly, lifeless romance, with no depth or meaning. There are so many things to get you wondering, but it's not a satisfying kind of suspense, more of a ""get on with it"". It seems like our beloved JKR is content with being unbelievably rich, and has stopped putting the magic into this once great series."
1,Always a great reading by Jim Dale,THe book was good as always and Jim Dale consistently puts the emotion and voices to the book that creates a don't stop listening pleasure. Also a great price at amazon!!!
3,Harry Potter and the You've-Gotta-Be-Kidding-Me!,"I was disappointed with this book. It seemed like a lot of the same old same old. After 5 books, you'd think when Harry thinks something is wrong people would listen to him, but NOOOO. That is very annoying.The first few chapters moved along slowly. I look forward to how Harry reacts to the Dursleys, but we see nothing of them save for a few brief paragraphs, and they weren't talking...The whole plot of the Half-Blood Prince is that Harry is CHEATING in class. Cheating! That's a good role model. Oh, and when you find out the identity of the Prince, you'll sit there as I did and go: ""So?""...The ending raised some questions, but was very confusing. We went from hardly any action to ALL the action at once at the end. I had to read it a few times to absorb it all.Looking forward to the end of the series if this is how the books are going to be."
5,The Sexy Love Review,"In the 6th book there is a lot of sexy love going on. I mean that Harry's suddenly falling for Ginny, Ron's going out with Lavender, and there is a romantic spark between Ron and Hermione. I'm also saying that there is a lot of 'snogging' (AKA MAKING OUT) going on. This definetly is very sexy love."
1,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,I read this book because of an English assignment I had to complete. This book was suprisingly good. J.K. Rowling is an incredible author. She writes so well! The 6th Harry Potter is packed full of surprises and different twists that will blow you away.Harry is changing so much in this book and is on his way to adulthood. The adventures in this book that Harry experiences and go through are not like any other that he has experienced. To tell the truth I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone that has enjoyed the past five books.
3,Doesn't live up to the 1st 5 books.,The 1st 5 books were indepth and not repetitive. Sequels always tend to wear down. Not many authors can have 4 equally great sequels after their 1st book. This book looks like it is about Harry Potter being obsessed about Voldemort and not being occupied with anything else. In the 1st 5 books Harry was occupied with a lot of different things. I still recommend getting the book if you plan to read Harry Potter 7 so you can follow the Harry Potter story better. I hope 7 will be better than 6 and be longer too.
3,Not as good as I expected,"I have to admit, I waited and waited with tons of anticipation for the sixth in the series, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. We know a lot more about Voldemort, but the story lurched along with tons of irrelevant details. And about halfway through, it became very predictable. Maybe J.K. Rowling is saving the best for last. I certainly hope so. Harry Potter 6 is not her best effort. I reluctantly recommend it, because it does advance the story."
3,Unimpressive...Monotonous,"The much awaited 6th book of Harry Potter was promptly delivered to the door before 10 AM. The 600+ pages were filled with information that is the same as all the books. The year starts all most the same way. Same things are being done, (There is no halloween) Christmas is there. Some love stories...teenage drama. Unnecessary killings, misplaced trust.Unless this book is a stage for the next book to come, there is nothing impressive about this book. Not a good read for children below 15."
2,Not so impressed,there was far to much kissing and far to little fightingnot nearly enough consistancyand far to little plotrandom elements are thrown in- that honestly do little to advance the plot-it takes a strange turn at the endthouhg that part of the book is very exiting- well- more exciting then the rest of the book- it really dosnt MAKE SENCE-i understand what the whole thing is going for- but it isnt in keeping with the other books- characters dont act quite as they should- and honestly you dont really CARE about what is going on- WAAAAYY to much dating- random inexplicable fights- plot lines that get left half way through- a compleate lack of plot in the rest of the book- you just wernt engaged!!!- perhaps it is because the book has been so built up over the previous months- but i was disapointed by the latest chapter in harrys life
4,my heart is so low,"I always read these books fast. and now that I am done I can't believe it. I am upset, hurt, PISSED OFF. I don't want to spoil anything but no one is done reading it so I cannot talk to anyone about how sad i am right now. And she just started writing book 7. another two years of waiting. I should have read slower. Why four stars, cause the last book was longer."
3,Harry Potter and the half blood prince,I just got my new Harry Potter book last night. I was hoping to get the book on cd soon. It's way way too expensive for me and I am on a limited budget since I don't work and am over 50. I have poor eyesight and other illnesses. i have trouble seeing at times but would like to listen to the story on cd. I know I could get them cheaper on audio cassett but i'd rather have them on cd. It is really sad that I can't get them on cd due to the expence.
1,Eh,"Not really impressed. I found it slow, boring, and really really stupid. I mean, how many wizard stories do we need? Then again, I didn't read the original books, but whatever."
3,Entertaining but dangerous,"A well written, captivating book but scary in that so many youths (adults too!) are being lured into occult practices by its contents. I would suggest parents be aware of what their children are reading. -Kathy McBride, author of ""Remember Lot's Wife: What Jesus Taught About the End of the World"""
4,It's here! And it lives up to expectations.,"Finally. Book the sixth has made its appearance. I don't want to spoil any future readers, so I'll be general in my comments. The book is slow to get into (much like Order of the Phoenix) but when you hit the last 100 pages... wow. Harry has grown up and is taking responsibility by the horns. He's grown out of his whiny rebellious stage, and is ready to face the facts about who he is and what he must become. Love finds all of our favorite characters in many different (some expected, some unexpected) ways. I missed the characteristic humor that Fred and George brought to Hogwarts, but as the story progresses, it is obvious that darkness if hovering ever near. Now, if only the seventh book would arrive tomorrow!"
3,A great author once said that good books should always end well,"I am a great HP fan but I think logic has taken leave of JKR. She has been on a killing spree since the 4th Book.Guys let's not forget that this is a storybook and it is losing it's entertainment value because kids can no longer enjoy it or because parents feel that the last few books are no longer appropriate for their kids.Yes, in real life things could be as bad but in a story book (more-like a fairy tale kinda magical book) JKR needs to paint at least a somewhat perfect world. Why keep killing people...unless she has plans to bring them back.Sonja Goge, CA"
5,great bleepin book best so far i dont belive this be spoiler beware u may think so,i loved the book it was the funnyest one as of yet but allso the most dramatic if you are a real big HP fan this book will hit you right in the heart as i was reading some reviews they were correct its alot about love i never saw it coming THIS BOOK CAN MAKE YOU CRY AT END I allmost did im till sad ya ya i know its only a book series some of us all we have is books...the one and only Dator
5,Mathematical innacuracy in HPHBP,"I love all these books. But... I'm a math teacher and I think there is a typo in the description of the standings (p 520). Before the final quidditch match we are told that Gryffindor has to win by 310 to win the house cup, if they lose by 100 they will be behind Hufflepuff and losing by more than 100 puts them in last. The last line should be a loss by more than 160. We know the scores of the 2 games involving Gryffindor. If the standings going into the last match are:Ravenclaw 2-0 +290Gryffindor 1-1 -10Hufflepuff 1-2 -110Slytherin 1-2 -170then this works. The way it is written the total points scored don't balance. Isn't math wonderful?(We have to assume all ties are broken on total points rather than head to head competition)"
1,Just commercial junk,"Rowling has definitely gone towards the commercial author who must write a contract work - inspired or not. In this case: NOT: lousy flat characters, often awfully stereotype (harry and ron and their interaction with girlfriends). Plus - guess what, the story goes on - keeps the bucks rolling too. Having been a fan from the start I decided this is my last Potter - and I could have done without it."
5,Great Book,"I have read many of the books in the Harry Potter series, and The Half Blood Prince, was definitely one of my favorites. The plot and the setting of the book book were much more exciting than the others in the series, even though they traveled much less and the plot never fully expressed itself until the end of the story. I found it a very easy book to keep reading, and I never found a boring point where I wanted to put the book down, I really liked how the author introduced old characters back into the story.I would highly recommend this book to strong readers since it is rather long (600-700pgs). I would not recommend this book to readers who have watched the movie before they read the book, because it is somewhat different. Overall, I do think anyone would like this book because it incorporates many themes such as mystery, fiction and fantasy. Again I thought this was a great book and would gladly read it again."
5,NOT A READER,THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I'VE READ(LISTENED TO IN 30 YEARS. NOW I OWN THE COMPLETE SERIES. NOT INCLUDING THE 7th BOOK. LOVED IT
4,Another Great Book from Rowling,"Loved the book, I read it quickly. I only gave it four stars because 4.5 wasn't an option.The only complaint is that the book like ""Two Towers,"" is setting up for the final book which left the ending more open.But that also leaves us with a couple years of guessing what she will do next...."
4,Brilliant. . . . but. . .,"This is probably the best book yet. A bit slow in the begining, but it soon grabs you and won't let go. You have to keep turning the pages just to find out what happens next. But brace yourself and get the tissues handy! I will not spoil the end for anyone but I don't think I could handle going to see this movie knowing what's coming! I gave four stars because of the ending, oh how could she?!"
2,"No wit, no humor, plagued book 5 and 6","The 6th book made me sad. The 5th book did too. I longed for The fun of books 1-3 -- especially the Prisoner of Azkaban. That is to say, Ron, Harry and Hermione used to have fun and say witty things. Remember when Ron made fun of Hermione's dentist parents? Now, I can no longer find any of the fun stuff that made earlier books so enjoyable. Where is the euphoria of a broom ride? Where is the happiness of freeing your uncle from prison? Now it is all trauma-drama sad. Perhaps the author is trying to reflect our current world-war infected times. Worse yet, she has lost her sense of wit."
5,Big Harry Potter fan,This book was great. Her books get darker and darker. The books are better than the movies. Even though the movies are good (I must admit)This one has more surprise twists than the last. You can't believe half the stuff that's happening. You just want to know what's going to happen to Harry. This book will make you feel happy and sad all in one.
5,Half-Blood Prince Rules,I love this book and everything about it. The death at the end was sad and expected. It's darker tone is more adult and suprisingly enjoyable. I recomend this book for any Harry Potter fan.
3,The Time Turner Blew It!!!,"It has become a matter of mental discipline to enjoy these books (beginning with Azkaban) because of Rowling's cop-out blunderous use of the Time Turner. After all, just turn back time and prevent all of the murders! If one can just lobodimize that from contaminating the reading experience, then Book 6 can be quite engaging and fun. But then again, I guess this is supposed to be a children's book."
3,NOT SUCH A GRAND ENDING,"I think that J.K.Rowling hurried thru the last few chapter....Not to spoil the book but the death in the book should have never happened that way...such a cheap shot, no way the death of that character would have ever occured in such a manner....."
5,Harry Potter... always on the edge...,this is one of the better stories in the Harry potter series. its thrilling and fun to read... i def recommend reading this one... but before that u have to read the ones before... looking forward to the next one... but look like a looooooooong wait...:(
5,Great - progressing well with the characters age. Hits the readers progression keeping it interesting.,"I'm pleased with the progression of the series. I started reading these with my son when they first came out. He has 'aged' with the characters. The content and storyline are advancing and altering right along with the characters and hence, my son. I hope that sharing this series will help him to develop a lifelong love of reading! Thanks for keeping things moving. We have spent a lot of time together over these books and that is something invaluable."
4,Average,"This book is definately not Rowling's best work. It contains a lot of useless information about different things that Harry ""needs to know"". The title should be changed. It should be like, ""Harry Potter and Voldemort's Return"". About 1/4 of the book was either useless, boring, or crazy. You should buy it when the price goes down a little."
5,Kept me interested from start to finish.,"While this book may not have as much action as previous books, it is still worth reading. All the low-star reviewers are basing there reviews on other Harry Potter books; even the worst Harry Potter book (which this is not) should deserve at least 4 stars! I am also inclined to point out the suggested reading age for this book (according to amazon); 9-12. Rowling has included many topics that kids of this age would not fully appreciate."
4,Hi,It was a great book of the harry potter books that I have read the whole time.( what you talking about willis) :)
3,"Good, but.. .","The beginning promises the same quality as the other books, and somehow it actually does deliver all those plot twists, humor and shocking revelations we have grown so fond of by now.... The greatest question lingering in my mind is: Which side *IS* Snape in?Still, I can't stop feeling that some of the romantic relationships are a little forced, and that it all went to reveal that Harry is now on a ""video-game like"" quest, finding things to defeat the arch-enemy, a cliche I find strange on a Harry Potter book. That, and yes, there *is* spider-man-esque scene."
2,In Limbo!,"Has Rowling lost her touch ? Or is she trying to evolve into a dark fantasy writer for adults ? I used to like Harry Potter for its delightful simplicity yet complex wondrous magical world building. It used to be a joy to read Harry's and company's adventures. But somehow from Book 5 onwards, Harry Potter no longer delivers. Book 6 has deteriorated further. Just do not understand the popularity of this series. For those of you who are still a child at heart I recommend the following instead, coming of age books featuring child protagonists which are notches above Rowling's writings, - ""In the Castle of the Flynns"", ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"", the darker ""Boy's Life"", Fantasy/Sci-fi ""Finity's End"", ""Tripoint"", ""Rider at the Gate"", ""Cloud's Rider"", ""Balance of Trade"", ""Ender's Game"", ""Warchild"" and even the horror ""IT""."
1,"Honestly, people...","This book sucked. Everything in it, included the 'twist' at the end, was completely predictable. The one thing that wasn't was the couples. Harry/Ginny? What the hell? Harry never saw Ginny in a romantic light, ever, then BOOM! He's in love with her.The whole Ron/Hermione thing was predictable, but it has no support. They make a lame couple, and Ron is hardly mature. This entire book was a waste of my time. Everyone talks about how is has so much action - where?JKR really bothed this one."
1,I enjoyed it but it wasn't as good as it could be,"This was a okay book but a lot of words were said about nothing, especially in the first 3rd. It was a bit fluffy and all over the place and Dumbledore is made out to be pretty dumb and it kind of shows how dumb he was in the other books. Hermione and Ron are pretty weird how they don't believe Harry's suspicions. It's not like he doesn't have a history with this sort of thing. So even though parts were more mature, parts were still very unrealistic and over drawn out for suspense."
5,An Stunning story for the Series,"I have read several of the Harry Potter books and I have enjoyed all of them. Some have their strengths and weakness, but for a consistent series these books are right at the top of my list. The author should be proud of herself to be able to maintain such excellence in the stories, well-written plots and characters. For me, Half Blood Prince was just a wonderful read and maybe in my opinion almost as good as Goblet Of Fire. Young or old, this book will keep you turning page after page as you try to determine what will happen next. I'd gladly recommend this book to all my friends. Don't miss this one."
3,Disappointment,"In the previous 5, Harry's life was in danger or there was meetings with Voldemort and Harry had to do his best to escape and survive. In the book, there was more to do with finding out about Voldemort's past. Even though it claims that this info is helpful, I was still disappointed. Nonetheless it was still a good book,despite the romance and dark drama near the end,I'd recommend this book to all Potter fans."
3,HB Prince is Not for kids under 10,My kids have grown up with Harry Potter. And thank goodness! Book 6 is for teens and maybe tweens. Sadness prevails at my house after finishing book 6.
1,DO NOT READ PLEASE SAVE YOU'R SELF.,"I'm 10 and the Harry liking Ginny thing makes me want to thow up. And when Harry gives Ginny the Spiderman talk, it makes me decide to read another book. The movies are geting dumber and dumber. Don't get me wrong because I used to love the books. But once I read this book, it died. Now I read a series called WARRIORS by Erin Hunter. But please if you love Harry Potter and if you'r ten DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF!!!!"
4,"""review of a current harry potter fan""","When, I started to read the the first chapter it was somewhat interesting but,not enough fans. But don't not buy it, the first chapter is only a bit boring, the rest will make you comeback for more. And also people who said the book dosen't focous on others in the last one, you are being stupid becasue it says half-blood prince on the title, and Dumbledore's lesson's are about Lord Voldemort's past which is very hard to understand so if you can see the book is mainly going to be about that. Although the order dosen't show up much, you are right, but remember each book had one focouse, but then again your comment was right it could have incolved the order more, and wizards contact."
4,"Good, but not as great as my experts hoped","I've enjoyed reading this special series to my children who are 13 and 11. They've loved it and were looking forward to another blockbuster. They enjoyed book 6, especially the scary parts, but felt it was just a notch below the others. I myself would have given it 3 and 1/2 stars."
4,Half-Blood All Action,"The magical trio returns in the sixth book of the series. Harry, Ron, and Hermione start a new year of adventure. This book captured my attention like the imperious curse.Harry starts his sixth year at Hogwarts and has special sessions with Dumbeldore. Since Voldemort`s return the magic world is in chaos and the muggles are being affected too. But how is it Voldemort keeps returning, why can't he be killed? Harry will discover this and more.I liked this book because every chapter was interesting and exciting. This book has shown me that with friendship and determination you can do anything. I recommend this book to everyone who likes adventure, mystery, excitement, and"
1,i am so dissapointed,"I used to be what you would call a ""hardcore"" harry potter fan, but now I am contemplating whether or not to even buy the seventh book when it comes out. JK Rowling has lost her touch in this installment of the series, as the characters have no emotional appeal and the plot rambled on for over 600 pages. What a waste of paper. This book was mediocre compared to the other books. JK Rowling has lost me as a fan forever. I can't possibly see how she could redeem the series in book 7 after coming out with this shambles of a book."
3,Disappointment,"The book was disappointing as the author killed off one of the best loved characters, Dumbledore. I hate books that end this way. I have followed these characters from the first book and I am not sure I will continue."
3,Transitional?,I know JK Rowling needed to tie up some dangling plot lines. I know the stage had to be set for the next book. I even predicted who was fated to die.But what happened to the sharp story line. Did I miss the plot of this book? I certainly did.I know the books must appeal to young and old alike for marketability. It's a shame the charm and wit of the first 5 books was missing in the forced romances.I hope the final volume lives up to the promise of the first 5. This one did not.
2,disappointing at best,This was the slowest developing and worst climax of any of the Potter books. Nothing that we look for in his books came out. This left about a million things to wrap up in the final book. We all know this is a war between good and evil and will eventually be won by Harry and friends but in the journey to that conclusion Harry goes thru the same thing over again...the fall off his broom...thinking Dumbledoor is gone...the twists with Snape and Malfoy...
2,DISAPPOINTING,"At first when I read the book, I was so relieved that Harry was no longer the angry, sullen teenager he had been in Book 5... until I realized Hermione was channelling all that teenage angst and then some. I HATED her in this book. Aside from the ridiculous level of her jealousy and anger, she was so stuck up and completely insufferable about the fact that Harry was outdoing her in Potions. Get over yourself!!! But I really was glad to see that Harry matured a lot, in Book 5 he would have thrown a tantrum at the Minister of Magic, now he just sets him straight clearly without all the dramatics. Anyways, I was very disappointed in the book like so many reviewers before me, I feel like the author was just filling in the gap between numbers 5 & 7. I'm glad I borrowed the book & didn't buy it!!!"
5,Harry potter and the half blood prince,This was one of the most exciting and interesting books in the Harry potter series. I could not put it down.
2,The Worst Book of the Entire Series,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the absolute worst book of the Harry Potter series. As a HP fan, I was quite disappointed with the entire novel. It's plot was confusing and there seemed to be way too many subplots. The theme of love in this book was a huge bore and in the end meant nothing to the overall story. The only important things in this book were the answer to the mystery of Voldemort and the loss of an important character. Otherwise, this book is no good. Half-Blood Prince is my least favorite of the series.Zachary B. MedinaAuthor of Decador"
1,Bad,placed a order and never got it and when ask about getting a refund they said they would do it right away still haven't gotten my money back I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN AND I DON'T RECOMMAND IT TO NO ONE .
1,"ordered on 8/30, still haven't received it","It's been a month, and I still have not received it. Shipped UPS Media Mail."
1,bate and switch,"I ordered Harry Potter and the Half-blood prince CD audio book, narrated by Jim Dale. I received a cd with ""all the harry potter books"", instead.Not at all happy -"
5,More of the same....,"But I want more!!!!!!Being in my late 30's, I enjoy these books as if I was 10."
4,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Bought this book for my daughter...yes, she's a Harry Potter fan. She loved the book and I enjoyed the great service and quick delivery."
3,A little letdown,"Let me first state I love the harry potter series. Every book up until this one I felt got better and better. I enjoyed the character development in this book. But, I felt it was a little dragged out. The first chapter I feel was unnecessary(unless this ties into the 7th book). I felt a little robbed because so much time was spend on the PM. I enjoyed the developing relationships between the various characters. The mood was a little dark in the book( which I guess is understandable with the series wrapping up). I would have enjoyed a few more humorious monents like in the last book when the weasley twins left school. I was truly sadden at the tragic turn of events. The ending is definately leaving me wanting more."
3,Disappointing,"I love the 'Harry Potter' series but this one fell short of the mark. It's like 600 pages of background reading for book 7.The others all had a complete storyline (the stone was discovered/recovered [Bk 1], the Chamber was opened and the heir revealed[Bk 2], etc.); all could be stand alone reads.I think she fell into the Anne Rice trap. As a reader I want some resolution after 600 pages to something. This book left me with nothing but a long wait to find out how it ends. I enjoy her writing style, but feel a little cheated being left like this."
3,Fire Breather = disappointment,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantastic book! The additional chapters added in the Fire Breather edition are really confusing, though, and have nothing to do with the rest of the story. It's just a bunch of weird dreams. Unless your a real collector, stick with the regular edition. It has all the good stuff and is much much cheaper."
2,So dissapointed,sadly this book just did not cut it for me and is by far the worst book in the series first JK rowling plays it to be a good movie about nine chapters dedicated to dumbledore and harry I wanted something new and what next six chapters about girls I do not mind one or two and then at the end I feel like the story hardly moved I will still wait at midnight for the last one but I hope it's better than this
3,Without Spoiling The Plot,"Okay, without reading the book, everyone knew someone would die in Part 6. Everyone knew it would become clear who Harry would eventually end up with. The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix both had their own plot twists and turns, though somewhat less significant. Here's my honest opinion. Part six is okay. Parts four and five were excellent. Here's why. Too much of The Half Blood Prince {almost half} is created through flashbacks as Dumbledore is reminiscing about how things ever got this bad in the wizarding world. Only half of the Half Blood Prince is actually happening now. Yes, I know this type of storytelling has been done before and very effectively {the Godfather Part II comes to mind}. But as enjoyable as Harry Potter is, it's not that type of epic. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the story. I'm saying too much of the story was left out."
5,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,In my opinion second best of the series after the Goblet of fire. Suspense is taken beyond. Can't wait for the last book of the series.
4,Another can't put it down book.,"Just like the other books in the series, I'm having trouble putting this book down; however, the storyline isn't as intense as the other books. I'm ready to get to the exciting scenes!"
4,harry Potter and the half blood Prince,"The sixth of seven books in the series. Depended on your memory of previous books which were better and this one seemed to be setting up for the last in the series. It, did not have the excitement of the battles and angst of the past books. Could not stand alone, and was subdued in the nature of the Problems of young maturation and of the protagnasts. It did not get into the development of change in their maturing and a mystry around the evil as in the past.This one did not have the omph of the eariler mystry for the hero to meet. Over all good english, good development but not to the excelence of the previous five."
5,J.K.Rowling & Harry Potter Books Are Awesome,"I love Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. The book was spectacular, i couldnt put it down(it took me 2 days to read it). I cannot wait for the next one. I think J.K.Rowling is a great writer. All of her Harry Potter Books are amazing. PLEASE MRS. ROWLING, keep them coming!"
5,WOW! I just can't wait for the last one!,"I really liked this book and cant wait for the next!It is true, different from other in the series, but as good as any. Seems a little short, but i did enjoy it anyway.I just could not believe my eyes when I read what one of my favorite characters did nearly the end, I can only hope that the character in question is not evil and that will redeem at the end. The way that the character prevents Harry from using unforgivable curses, makes me wonder.....Wont spoil the plot, just read it and enjoy it!!!!!!"
5,Excellent,"She gets better with every book she writes, couldn't put the book down untill I finished reading it."
4,harry potter is almost over,"it is a great series of books, although i feel that this one is a little bit boring. but, there is so much information in it that you cant skp it if u are reading the series. hopefully the last one will be amazing"
4,Change in characters,"I think that from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix onwards , the spotlight changed from their adventures to the changes and relationships between the characters. If you read the first book again, you will see the percentage of the pages about the climax(mostly meetings with Voldemort) has decreased over the books. The adventure wasn't really that exciting this time. It's not really as adrenaline-pumping and on the edge. It's worth the time, though it didn't make it to my favourites."
5,Excellent Book!,"In my opinion this book was very well written. While it is a bit sad in the end, the series is coming to an end, as everyone knows, so of course it is a bit more ""mean"".I don't agree that it is geared toward adults. I think it is geared toward the same audience that the series has always been geared toward, ""everyone"" ;) While there is a kind of ""meanness"" in the book, that should be expected as Harry gets older.If you are a fan of the Harry Potter books you will love this book as well."
4,Prelude for an epilogue...,"Prelude for an epilogue...this is how I would describe this book. Perhaps, some people found it dull and boring; to those people I must say that this is a series, one thing connects to another and I think this was that part of the story where everything made sense and where a few new enigmas were born. As for me, this was a book of revelations and light in order to clearly understand whatever is going to happen to the boy who lived.Bottomline is: ""this is a book that will make you understand most of the ""untold"" things in the series""."
4,I was another midnight purchaser,"I've been a fan of JKR's books since reacing Chamber of Secrets when it released. I'm an adult fan and have been active in the whole fan community, etc. I guess you could say I came in to this with a big fan's mentality.I really DID enjoy the book, but I found it a bit predictable in parts. I anticipated 'the death', but found it almost anticlimactic. There has to be more to this!I was a bit disappointed in the romances and lack of development. The one couple has been almost predestined for a few books, but the second one (Harry and ********)...I was disappointed. I wanted to see the build up of a relationship there. She did a better job establishing Harry and Cho.Some of the twists and turns were refreshing while others just led to questions, butI guess that's what JKR does best.I do wish she'd give us a HEA sometime. The last three books have all featured a death in the last quarter of the book. I miss closing a Harry Potter book with a happy sigh of contentment."
5,Surely... you've not waited this long to buy it!,"Although all six books are about the same characters in the same settings, J. K. Rowling has managed to make each instalment in the Harry Potter saga starkly different from the others. Where book one started out with excitement - of an oppressed young man entering his rightful world for the first time - each successive book has taken the reader not just further into Harry Potter's story, but also deeper into his world. Book six peels away one more layer of mystery about Harry's purpose in life and sets the stage beautifully for the grand finale - book seven. Can't wait for it to come out!"
2,Sadly disappointed in this book!!!,I know this will offend many who are Harry Potter die hards but...I can't even put in to words how disappointing this series is getting. It started off so good (and the overall plot was decent but) the more books she writes the worse they get. I am totally in agreement with the review above; this book is like a bad episode of Saved by the Bell!!! I am so sorry I wasted my time reading it!! But you almost have to at this point..
5,Oh my... the best HP next to Askaban and Goblet of Fire,"This is a outstanding book! I read it in 3 days, because I couldn'tput it down! I would like to say J.K. Rowling is one of my favorite writers of all time next to Meg Cabot, Sarah Dessen, and Gail CarsonLevine.This book is exceptional! It was darker, had more romance in it, and was a tear jerker in the end.It is perfect for anyone who loves fantasy, adventure, and mystery. This is my favorite Hp book yet, and I await the Seventh one to find out what happens in the end. This a wonderful book and I think everyone shall enjoy it and treasure it forever."
5,Plot Twists...,Having finished the book the day it came out I am quite excited to write this review. I thought the book was magnificent with a feww shocking surprises. Characters change greatly over time as I have learned reading this book. Personally one of my favorite character undergoes a change for the worst. I do admit though that this book possibly lacked the emotion I was looking for in one particular scene but I got over that quickly. I find that the last battle in this book might have a hidden meaning so pay close attention to it. Over all the only real disappointment from this book is having to wait another year for the final book to come out.
5,Wow! What a Book!!,"No spoilers here :).After anxiously awaiting the new HP book, I can say without a doubt that it definitely holds its own with the rest of the series. The book is excellent as i had to read it all in 1 day. Many questions are answered and some are left unanswered. The book tends to become or make you feel emotional, especially the ending, but I don't want to say more in case of spoiling it for you. I can honestly say that before reading this book, I did not have an inkling who the half-blood prince was and there is definitely a twist there. A must read!!!!"
3,Average at Best,"This book was to me, a huge fan of the series, a big letdown. First we have the death of Dumbledore. Not only is this not necessary but the way he dies is completely out of character for him. Yes, let us heap more misery on Harry who never gets a break. Secondly, after 5 stories that have Harry figuring out what people are up to we once again are treated to his friends not believing him. Just once could his supposed 'friends' trust him after all these years? Last but not least all of you need not worry about the next book being the last. If Harry, Ron and Hermione do not attend Hogwarts for their last year then this leaves open the possibility of the adventures going on forever."
3,"It's the same, but I'll keep reading!","The latest in the Harry Potter saga is quite like its latest predecessors, with little real action until the last chapters, another death that could have been avoided if only Harry had confided in his elders, and again, those annoying and unnecessary spelling and grammatical errors sticking out like sore thumbs, but how I'd *love* to be Ms Rowling's proof-reader for her next book[s].I won't give away the plot [or its holes] since readers [such as my nieces!] should pursue it for themselves, and like so many of us, I love the characters too much to be too critical, and isn't that the magic?Not as spell-binding or intricate as her earlier books, but, as always, a couple of chapters had me in tears. I'm looking forward to the next adventures of her endearing characters as well as the story behind Dumbledore's hand.3 1/2 out of 5 stars."
1,Terrible book!,"Harry's mood wasn't consistent with with the previous book (he should be more moody and crabby now, after all that's happened, shouldn't he?). The grammar and punctuation were terrible. There was too much kissing. There was too much gore. The only interesting parts came near the end. The rest was formulaic and nearly plotless. The whole thing was an overblown introduction to Book 7. If I had actually bought a copy (rather than borrowing it from the library), I would be very angry at having wasted my money. As it is, I'm angry that I wasted so much time."
3,"Good Story, Bad Writer","I personally liked the story. It's not as fast paced as some of the other books, but it's definitely darker than some of the other books. J.K. Rowling needs to get a thesaurus though. I found in this book as well as the other books, she uses the word ""incredulously"" so much. Yes, J.K., we realize you can use big words, but seriously, come on."
3,J. K. Rowling Should Lay Off the Cooking Sherry.....,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince or should I say Harry 'Pooper' and the HBP... was sub-par at best. Definitely the worst book of the series. Ms. Rowlings spends most of this installment rehashing the content of the 5 previous books, hooking the various characters in pre-pubescent love triangles, or giving background for Book 7.As for the real content of the storey, this limited to the final few chapters, and instead of monstrous 500 pages, the entire could have been condensed into the slimest book of the series.To me it seemed that Ms. Rowling was far more concerned with $ then the storey, which is a pity. I just hope she lays off the cooking sherry for Book 7 and rebounds with a strong finish."
3,disappointing read,"harry potter have long been my favorite series, but wow...this book killed me, cant Rowling just give harry a break?...there was an utter lack of the little details and happy times that make hogwarts so magical. i am just in shock, especially after Sirius in book 5, i cant believe what she did here...yeah i get it, harry it stong and he can make it himself, etc... but please, what does this accomplish?J.K. Rowling has a lot of explaining and making up to do in book seven...good luck.i cant wait!"
3,NOT VERY INTERESTING,"I WASN'T ENTHRALLED WITH THIS BOOK- IN FACT,I WAS DISAPPOINTED. THE ENTIRE NOVEL WAS FORMULAIC- SIMPLE PLOT,BLAND STRUCTURE,HINTS SO BLATANT THAT THE ENDING WAS APPARENT BY THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK. THE AUTHOR'S ATTEMPT TO SHOW A ""DARKER"" SIDE ,QUITE FRANKLY, FAILED.SHE NEEDS TO RE-THINK HER APPROACH TO HER SUBJECT ."
5,A Real Cliffhangar,Loved the book as I have all the others. This one however left me hanging more than the others for the next and unfortunatly the last in the Potter series.
3,Not what I expected.,"I am a big Harry Potter fan and have read all the books multiple times. This is the only book that I haven't been eager to read again. After I bought this book I couldn't stop reading it. Not because it was amazingly interesting or well-written, but because I was so eager to get to the climax that never came. Once the book started to get interesting it was over. There was a death in the book that I always expected but never wanted to come. There was romance in the book which did make it somewhat interesting. Surprisingly for Voldemort being at large there was very little present Voldemort. The book revolved around his past. The bad guy at the school was someone that I was finally learning to accept after learning some of his past. The book was entertaining, but not what I wanted from this series."
4,It's pretty good,"I am a big fan of Harry Potter and I read books #1-6. I found that in books # 5 & 6, J K Rowling lost a few of her amazing ideas because they seemed to get boring. In book 6, she did do a better job than in book 5 and it is also not as long and boring. There is great suspense and delivery and it will keep you reading.I recommend this book for any Harry Potter fan."
3,Greetings from Griffen-door!,"Hi there, Dumbledore may or mey not be dead, certainly the spells and potions that he and Harry worked on are not. The truth is hidden in a little known criminal case in a backwoods town and guess what? The REAL Harry Potter pulled that transcipt which included testimony from all of the witnesses! Your move Malfoy, Checkmate....."
5,LOVED IT!!!!!,I just finished this book and I loved it. It is very well written and you are captivated from the very begining. Harry Potter fans will not be disappointed. I couldn't put it down. I strongly encourage everyone to read this book. You fall in love with the characters and you feel you are a part of the story! READ THE BOOK!
5,fascinating book,this book is very good. it made me cry when Dumbledore died. i can't wait to read the deathly Hallows
3,Harry Potter's Lament,"Being a mom of two young children, it took me about a week to finish reading this book. The difference, I noticed, was that in HP books past, I found it painful to put the book down and do the basic, yet necessary, as in feed my kids. This time, I could put the book down and provide a pretty decent meal! In short, the 6th book did not provide me with the suspense, excitement, humor that I loved in all the previous books. Even the Goblet of Fire, my favorite, in all its darkness, left me spellbound and wanting more. The Half-Blood Prince was not the captivating book I anticipated. Even the death and betrayal were nothing short of what I figured out within the first few chapters. Come on, JK, help make child neglect at my home worthwhile again!"
2,disappointing,I am a teacher and have absolutely loved all of the other books. I was very disappointed with this one. I felt that too many questions were left blatantly unanswered. This author doesn't need a ploy like this to get us to read her books!Why would a great wizard like Dumbledore blindly trust someone like Snape? The readers deserve to know the answer to that question at least. It was very unsatisfying to me. I'm sure I am well in the minority. I just expected more of her.
5,My favorite so far!!!,"First of all, read Order of the Phoenix before this one, as they will be using many references from it.After reading Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix over a year ago, I started to get antsy at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince. Let me just say, it was well worth the wait. This book exceeds my expectations hugely. There is an element of romance introduced, many new mysteries, including horcruxes, and tragedy. This was the only book that made me cry, and it wasn't just a tear, I felt emotionally drained after finishing it.If you are into this series, I highly, highly reccomend reading this one, as it is the best. Just remember to read Order of the Phoenix again, since it uses many references from it, especially the ""prophecy."""
1,Half -a-review for half a book.,"Harry Potter is no longer a story for children. What happened Ms.Rowling? 303 pages into the book and no magic, I used to relate to Harry Potter, and, felt I knew J.K. Rowling. So far very dissapointed, maybe the rest of the book will be better, one can only hope..... R.W. Salisbury,Massachusetts"
2,Um????????????????,"Given how formulaic the other books in this series are, it was disappointing to see the formula being repeated without anything to give it a bit of spark. A formulaic series like this needs something in each book to set it apart. The incidents we got in this book are not it. Only a few words. Dull. Boring. Uninspired. It could so easily have been different, but even the moving, powerful moments, were done in a flash with no real emotion. It was all too simple.I am a bit sick of Harry being right about everything. He always has sneaking suspicions. They are always right. Yes, Malfoy is nasty. Yes, he probably is plotting behind your back. So what? Harry could be wrong sometimes, just to keep things interesting."
4,Build-up,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" by itself is a very good novel. When compared to its predecessor ""Order of the Phoenix"" and the last installment ""Deathly Hallows"", it doesn't quite measure up. The sixth book of the series is largely a build-up to transition to the final stand-off in the seventh book, but it seems like there is just a little too much talking and not enough classic Harry Potter action. I guess this was a pretty necessary transition, however, as it does set up the conclusion of the series very nicely. I suggest that if you have not read this book yet to make sure that you have the seventh book handy as you are going to want to continue on as soon as you finish this one."
5,"Still good, but needs a summary of previous books.","I read about twenty books between this Harry Potter and the last one, so previous details are not fresh in my memory. I would have wished they included a summary of the previous books. I'm not a hard core Harry Potter fan. I'm a casual reader of all books, so I kind of need to be reminded about certain details.However, this book is immensely readable for a book this size. In a strange note, I think this is the first book where the number pages did not increase over the last one. Anyway, I was easily able to finish it a mere weekend, which speaks volumes about the fluidity of such a book. Rowling delves into Voldermert's past, brings about treachery, and does so much more.So yeah, it's a great book. Even though J.K. Rowling can buy and sell me at her will, I will still contribute to her ever growing empire when the next book comes out."
5,Harry Potter Rocks!!!!,"I have totally enjoyed all the Harry Potter books and can't wait until the final book number 7. The movies don't do the books justice, but how could they? They would have to be 5 hours long to include every wonderful detail of the books. J K Rowling is by far the most imaginative author I have had the pleasure of reading."
3,"Not as good as the previous books, but still a must read","In comparison to the other Potter books, I believe that this book is not as good. The story is dark and it focuses on lesser characters... Even Ron and Hermione do not have a big part in the book. The story is the darkest till now and honestly the first 450 pages were not as exciting as the previous books. But the last 150 pages of the books are amazing, and have a few unbeliavable twists and turns. If you are a potter fan you must read it, however while reading it do not compare it to the previous books but try to notice how this book is shaping the next and final book....."
4,Simply devastating.,"Like Harry, I can't believe he's truly dead. Is he really? Maybe he'll come back in the last book. I just can't imagine it. Surely snape isn't what they say he is? Oh the questions upon questions. Thank goodness I've started reading these after the last book has been published. I'll soon know the end of it all!"
4,Excellent condition,"Very quick shipping, thought I ordered a hard copy but received a soft cover, not a big deal. Product has no marks or torn pages, excellent condition. I am on book 4 right now can't wait to get to 7."
5,The Best Yet!,"Before HP6 came out, The Goblet of Fire was my favorite. This book beat it. Now my favorite Harry Potter Book, The Half-Blood Prince stirred up a lot of emotions with in me. I laughed, cried, was in shock, and spent a lot of time on the edge of my seat. I am 37 years old and started reading the Harry Potter books because of the excitement it was generating in my kids. JKR actually gave my children a desire to read. I personally don't think this book is appropriate for children under 13. I believe she has written a book series that grows as her fans grow. My now 16 year old will enjoy this book as much as he did the 1st one."
3,"Fast Read, Slow Action","I found this book rather dissapointing compared to the 5 earlier books. The action was stilted and the ending anti-climactic. Much of the appeal of the first books is Harry's distinctions between good and evil even when ""adults"" try to convince him otherwise. This book attempts to blur this thoughtful distinction with gut reactions in a way that seems more like a plot fizzle than a plot twist. I hope this was only meant as a bridge story like the Matrix 2 because it was equally unsatisfying."
4,Wanting more,"Rowling again has her readers finishing the book and asking for more. This book does answer some questions, but it creates many more. The first quarter of the book she seems to explain a lot for readers who may have skipped books 1-6. (Shame on them.) The final quarter of the book gets you to the point of not being able to put the book down until you are finished. I do feel the final chapter was a let down with very little action. Rowling has done an excellent job of setting up the final book. One can already image the quest Harry will be setting out on. This book is much more mature than 1-4. I am glad that my daughter is going into seventh grade as she is reading this one. Some of the material might be a little dark or over the head of children below sixth grade. Although I enjoyed the book I still rate #3 as my favorite Harry book."
2,Pathetic.,"Congratulations JK Rowling. You have turned Harry Potter into Lord Voldemort. I don't think Rowling did this by herself though, hmmmmn? I smell a big rat in this book, and a cowardly rat at that. Anyone want to respond? I am R.W. still alive in Salisbury, Massachusetts"
3,Disappointing,"I am such a fan of Jim Dale - and have loved the previous 5 Harry Potter books he read to life. Listening to the Potter world characters was ""magic"". But this version is a disappointment. The characters' voices aare not consistent with the previous books. They even changed within Book 6. Perhaps there was too much pressure to release the audio version the same day as the hardcover and Dale didn't have time to review those sound bites of characters he keeps from the previous books. Or, perhaps he had a cold. For whatever reason, this audio book just did not meet the previous level of excellence the other Harry Potter books had."
4,More low keyed than the others - I smell a major diversion!,"Yes, so-and-so dies. Yes, so-and-so did the foul deed, even though so-and-so didn't do it. I suspect Rowling has set up a diversion here. Remember, this is a ""magic"" world, and things are not always what they appear to be. We'll need to wait and see.Otherwise, #6 is much shorter on action, longer on exposition - a restful interlude, a kind of literary hex to divert and deceive, the eye of the storm, perhaps. The wool has been pulled over our eyes - that's what a ""sixth sense"" tells me."
3,A bit of a let down,I found this book to not be simply as good as the other books. It lacked action and adventure and was very predictable. Though it left a lot to be done in year 7 which has the potential to be the best book yet.
2,As cliche as this review,"As noted by many reviewers, ""The Half Blood Prince"" fails as a literary work but succeeds as transitional material or as a prequel to the 7th Harry Potter book. There is no plot. Frankly, without the other books in the series it cannot stand alone, has no merit whatsoever as an individual work.To its credit, there is some interesting information concerning Voldemort's past, but this was often long-winded and could have been severely condensed.The romance was irrelevant and unnecessary. Yes, they're 16 and ""in love,"" but this does not have to take up half the book. Also, I could care less about Tonks and her relationship blues.There were far too many clichés in this book; the one-sidedness is getting annoying (all Slytherines are deceitful, all Gryffindors rule, etc). The interesting characters (Neville and Luna) have been pushed into the background for mundane, clichéd Slughorn and Ginny's many lovers.Cliché death; I cannot re-read the book without grimacing."
3,One for the Harry Potter fans,This is a rather good book with interesting character growth. But I won't recommend it for those who never read anything from Harry Potter.
5,Teaching love of books and reading,"This is the best of an excellent set of books which are the best to get a young person to start reading and to love reading. Let us hope there will be more such books. Our now teenager started enjoying reading with the first Harry Potter. Well done, J.K. Rowlings!"
4,sandy's review of harry potter and the half blood prince,"this book was worth the wait,harry had to go through a tremendous ordeal but it makes him all the stronger for the final chapter.i enjoyed the fact that j.k rowlings made the characters act the way teenagers are supposed to,meaning hand gestures and so forth.bottom line i think this book was excellent and i can wait to find out how it ends."
1,Pathetic,"I've been a big fan of Harry Potter ever since it first came out, when I was about eleven years old. I grew up into a teenager, as did Harry and his friends. But honestly, Rowling's interpertation of teenagers in this book is horrible. I know very few people my age who think of kissing and getting laid every other second (and they're both pregnant). That's basically what she has turned the HP kids into--hormone driven teens that think only of the opposite sex. It was a dissapointing read, and I really don't think it's worth over five bucks.I only read the Harry Potter books to escape into a world of magic, not stupid crap I can watch on MTV. There's enough of that stuff in this book to make you want to throw up.There's no point in hurrying to read this book (if for some God-forsaken you absoloutly have to), as Rowling's gonna take at least three good years to write the final book. Don't buy it, go to the library insead."
3,Not the strongest...,...but still a good read. You really are left with the impression that this book is just setting up for a big conclusion. I hope Rowling still has some surprises in store for #7.
4,Slow but good,"I recently finished the book and found it pretty good. We all can't wait to get to the end of the series, that way we'll see what fate has in store for mister potter. I say pick it up if you want a long read. I also recommend Dope by RObert Escandon. It's kinda like a childrens book, but recommended for those who want to think."
5,Harry Potter and the Half Blod Prince,"This was a purchase for my daughter, we both have all the printed versions of all the books as well as all the CD's. I love the books but Jim Dale's reading makes the story come allive. Harry is my favorite (I am 65 years old and my daughter is 44)and I can't wait for the last book and the rest of the DVD's to be released.Thank youEdie Faylor"
5,are these adults writing these hateful reviews?,"WOW! after reading some of the other reviews i am quite shocked that these are being written by adults. i mean get off it guys its not like you wrote the friggin book. so some people didnt live and die for book 6, why are people taking it so personally? as far as book 6 goes i quite agree that for some children it will be way too sad but that isnt to say it will be too sad for ALL children but i didnt see ANY reviews that said ""absolutely NO children should read this book"". lighten up guys people are entitled to their own opinions without being attacked by a bunch of badly behaved mom's and dad's."
2,"Alright, Time for theTruth","I really didn't like this book. Now I'm not saying I don't like it because of the events that happen (the person who dies) I'm basing it on the fact I think JK Rowling seems to think that by killing off a character, the plot becomes more interesting. I think the quality of the writing isn't half of what the fourth of fifth books are. And honestly, who decided that by adding emotional teenagers who date around and have little sense of moral value would liven up a story. The point of this book is to represent the depression of war and the true evil of Lord Voldemort, I hardly saw any of that. The one liner innuendo and the distraction of intense immaturity distracted from the plot. I think she could have done better."
4,In Keeping with the flow,"It appears there are two sides to the Harry Potter fan camp- One believes the first book was the best in the series. The other (which I can relate to) feels the series has gotten richer and more complex as it has progressed. Book 6 offers no shortage of surprises in its effort of pulling the characters along. Fans of the past 5 will find much to appreciate. Unfortunately only 1 more and the series all comes to an end. I've been sending out feelers to other fantasy works to fill the void:The Uncommon Adventures Of Tucker O'DoyleNight Of The StalkersEragon (Inheritance, Book 1)Eldest (Inheritance, Book 2)"
5,Bravo JK-another awesome book!,"I think a lot of people are getting so wrapped up in the hype of Harry Potter that they forgot what HP is in the first place- a children's book. And as far as children's books go- this one gets an A+. It stimulates the imagination, it entertains and its fun! I highly recommend investing 12 hours or so in reading this book. Great job JK!"
5,Wonderful Book,"I think JK Rowling just keep getting better with Book 6 in her series. Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts is fun as Harry continues his journey with new characters and amazing puzzles to keep even the most avid HP fan entertained.Like most HP fans, after I read book 6 I immediately read the new ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence to gain even more INSIGHTS and CLUES into Book 6 and JKR. Now I'm ready for Book 7!!"
4,Number 6 down....,"I finished the Half Blood Prince yesterday, I didn't find it overly long. In fact I thought the author was writing more for an older audience. The storyline moves forward. All in all a good read and Rowling keeps getting better.*** Spoiler Warning ***There is one thing that I have not heard mentioned in any of these reviews about Snape. Snape is emerging as one of the most conflicted characters in the story. I think before it is all done we will find he is *not* the evil he appears to be at the end of the book.Some things to keep in mind:- Snape swore an ""unbreakable oath"" to accomplish the task.- Snape does not allow Harry to use an ""unforgivable"" curse.- Even when fighting him he is lecturing him in what he needsto learn to effectively fight Voldemort.Not the actions of an enemy. More like someone caught in an trap with no way out."
2,"Scik of Harry Potter? try this ""Behind the dark Curtain"" by Adam W. Gibson.","I think this is the worst Harry Potter book I have ever read. The characters are not even like they used to be, very 2D boring. For something thrilling and cool, and no magic at all, check out Adam W. Gibson's ""Behind the Dark Curtain""."
1,Rowlings lost the plot.,"with no plot, subtlety, suspense or humour this book easily marks itself as the worst in the series. unlike the other books we are not drawn into Harry Potters world, instead we watch from afar,bored. And its as if JK Rowling has forgotten some of the main aspects of her story, as i was reading it i kept checking back to see if id missed any pages. This book is inconsistent and badly written, i only wish more people could see this!"
2,Hype has gone to her head,C'mon people! Rowling's first book was a work of genius. Every succeeding book has deteriorated in quality and this latest one is no exception. She keeps introducing new characters without properly developing the existing ones. The romances in this latest effort are embarrassingly bad. Her formula has become so tired. I loved Rowling's first book. It depresses me so much that so many people can't see the difference between that work of art and the shoddy knock-offs she has been presenting us with since then. I just hope that she finds an editor with enough backbone to tell her that she needs to do a better job for her final installment
3,Disappointing,I find this US version to be inferior to its UK counterpart. Stephen Fry's characters sound just right to me (and apparently to JKR too).
4,Comments on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6),This book is easy reading and fun as all the Harry Potter books have been. It has a good plot and follows up on the activities of Harry and his friends as they grow older. Each book makes one eager to see what happens in the next book. It is good reading for adults and young people alike.
5,my last fourteen hours...,"I bought this book around noon the day it came out, yesterday. I sat around all day reading it nonstop other than food and restroom breaks. It took me 14 hours, until 2 in the morning, but finally, yet sadly, I finished it. My only question now is how long do I have to wait until the next one comes out. I won't spoil it, but it kept me on the edge of my seat the intire time, wondering what might pop out next. I've never reviewed a book before, but I love this book. Thank you."
1,Worst book so far !!!!!,Let me start by saying I am a Harry Potter Fanatic. I loved all of the other books and have read them all numerous times. I even have them on tape as well for road trips. Did I mention I am 37? What a geek.This book was a huge let down. Mrs Rowling what happened?? There is not much of a plot and it is somewhat dull.. You don't get the attachment to characters like you did in the other books. The rich detail is also not there like in the other books.Had the first book in the series been like this I never would have been sucked into harry potters world.The ending was shocking but I was so bored by that point I didn't care.I hope she steps up to the plate in the next book.
4,oh man what a page turner!,You have waited for it and it has arrived...Some of you may already have finished reading it! I can't tell you much for some of you who have not read it but one thing I can say is that if you hated Snape before you will really loathe him after this book!The action is just as good as the other books but it is really dark and we learn a lot concerning some characters! It was really worth the wait oh and get out your handkerchiefs for the death of the character... You might need it if you are really emotional... Well happy reading!
2,not what i expected,"this book was not so good. it had a tendacy to drag on and is redundant to say the least. way to predictable. alot of unanswered questions, from book five, ideas she started and never followed through. charchter death to predictable and unrealistic. this writer makes far to much money for medicore books."
2,Needs Excitement and editing,"I am again disappointed in the newest Harry Potter book, as I was in number 5. I may buy the last book, when it comes out, in order to have the set but I will not rush to own it.This story isn't as magical or as inventive as the earlier books. Nothing gripping or intriguing happens other than people bashing each other with spells. The characters do not seem to grow and the lack of skill development by the hero leaves a lot to be desired. A hero that isn't able to learn and doesn't excel at anything but gets by on luck can only last so many books - I think 4 was the limit.Too bad I had such high hopes."
1,RIP-OFF!!!!!!,"Ok, so we wait and wait and wait and wait, do a little more waiting and then what do we get? A romance story! There is no action like the other books. We waited for nothing! It was a rip off! JK Rowling is losing it! All the other books id give like 5 stars or something. Not this one. Never. I hope Rowling can pull it together for the 7th book. Or were doomed to be bored with romance!!! Ah!!!!!"
2,Where have the action and excitement gone to?,"Where was the action and excitement? The first 3/4 of the book was just a whole lot of babbling about Harry's feelings and frustrations. Where is the magic, the trill and suspense?"
4,Not thrilled,"I love the series. However, I am not overly impressed with this book. Yes it is great and well written but the story seriously depressed me especially knowing how long we'll have to wait for the conclusion. Harry went from nearly juvenile at the end of 'Order of the Phoenix' to mature at the end of this. There was some inconsistancy in his emotions between the end of last book and the start of this book. I still like this book but I think I need some Prozac."
4,Great setting. Bad ending?,"The first two acts of this book are exceptional, but I feel the final act is hampered by Rowling's lack of command of action. Just like the previous books in the series, Rowling is amazing when she's describing the unique environment and the wonderful characters at Hogwarts. In Half-Blood Prince she delves more into the character of Voldemort and his background.Unfortunately the book's inrecdible suspense must playout in the end, and I feel it is quite a disappointment. I never felt Rowling was very good in her action writing, but this ending just seemed like one long plot device to set up the next book."
4,"slow to start, and many many tears at the end","Another wonderful book by J.K. Rowling. It feels kinda like watching a season premier after waiting a long time for the conclusion to a cliffhanger season finale. They tie up all the loose ends from Phoenix within the first several chapters (i.e. why occlumency is no longer necessary) and then once Harry returns to Hogwarts, we are returned to another fantastic adventure of the boy-who-lived, or as they call him now, ""the chosen one"""
2,"Fluffy beginning, few inconsistencies, good ending","Bad:These are books intended to be for children and I was very disturbed to find ""slut"" used in this book. For someone who used an alternate term for making out(snogging), I expected much different from Rowling. I could deal with all the murder, dark magic and hatred in the book, but it was always described with taste - skipping over the vulgarities. Hopefully she won't have the vulgar terms in there next time around.I was also unhappy with the fluff at the beginning. It wasn't until about pages 150-200 that things were actually getting interesting. It seemed like there was a lot of writer's block in the beginning of the book.I would say this is the worst book of the series.Good:Rowling weaved a pretty good story this time around. After the fluff, the action of the end was awesome and the pages were turning as fast as I could. Overall, the ending was worth the time and will keep us guessing as she takes time off before book 7."
5,Her best book yet!,"It was very interesting trying to read this book. The ending I must say is very suprising! I almost cried when reading the final two chapters of the book. It was as action packed as the other 5 books but it has a lot of meaning to the series. As it does when all the new books come out, it clears a lot more things up about the rest of the series. Although, to who ever reads this comment on the book and hasn't read it, I advise you to read the 5th book over. If you have only read the fifth book when it came out and haven't read it since, the 6th book will not make a very much sense. The one thing that I really disliked about the book is that they really didn't get to go to anywhere new (not including the cave). I would still give this book five stars and I can't wait until the next book!"
2,This one has lost the magic book 1-5 had,"I never put down book 1-5 until I finished reading, even for those which I watched the movie first. But this one is different. The story becomes so predictable and typical, there is no more those subtle humor I used to love. As some reviewer put it, this one reads like as if written by some Harry Potter fan.Compared with book 1-4, the book is filled with more hatred than happiness, more contempt than respect. Anyone is judged just by the house they belong and sometimes even by how their name is spelled. And those kind of judgements always turn out to be right in the book. It's almost like promoting racism. Was JK Rowling a racist after all?"
1,Amazon did NOT gift wrap or respond to my complaint,"I paid for gift wrapping. Amazon did NOT gift wrap the item. Worse, it has been a week and Amazom still will not respond to my inquires or request for ajustment."
5,super potter,"half blood prince is agreat story .filled with adventures and endless flirting and fun .it"" s the must read book of the century ."
5,spoiler alert,"Dumbledore dies, not cool, even if there was a good reason, and Draco totally wimps out, I found that funny."
5,Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince ( Book 6),It was very well what I was expecting and much more. There was no chance of being let down with this one. Nor could I put this one down.
4,"ordered it from Amazon, Read it over the weekend. Buy it if you read the other books first","I ordered it from Amazon and read it over the weekend. I have read the entire series and seen all the movies.I am an adult reader of Fantasy. My review is from that point. However, this book is darker than the earlier books in the series and might give nightmares to young kids.The book does begin to tie up a lot of loose ends and red herrings. It also sets the stage for the end of the series in Book 7.There are a lot of explanations by Dumbledore that take away from the story. Most readers will be familar already with the story [it is volume 6] and could have done with a bit of editing. But Ms. Rowling probably is too powerful to get edited the way that she should be edited.I did enjoy the addition of the politics of the Ministery of Magic and it's connection to Harry and Dumbledore.Buy it but read the other books first!"
2,how disappointing,"I have loved every Harry Potter until this one. I felt cheated-to read 600+ pages and have the book end with only questions and few answers was most frustrating. With each prior book there was some sense of victory, a confrontation with Voldemort, and a complete story. This book felt like a ""Part 1"" rather than the 6th book in the series. The ending was not believable and provided more questions than answers. It is frustrating to think that it will be another couple of years before these many unanswered questions are addressed. I'm just sad to have to leave Harry and Hogwarts in such an unsatifactory manner."
5,AWSEM!,This book was great way better than the Order of the Phoenix I loved I can't wait for the 7th I hope that JK writes it fast!
3,good,i was waitng eargerly for the book and read it straight through. but the last chapter was disappointing i dont mind so much that dumboldore died but she dint write it very well its like she neglacted the last part of the book. its not breathtaking and i feel she could have added more excitment and suspense its almost as if we always knew about snape. my point is she could have put in a little bit of thrill and suspense into the last part of the book. but on the overall i appreciate the idea of harry as a grown up he might not be as responsible but i think he is being given a chance to fight an individual war. i just cant wait for the next book
3,"""Fast Forward""","I've read all the Harry Potter books and Book 6 is not at the top of my list. As I read the book I had the feeling the story was in ""fast forward"" as though I were skimming through it. However, I do look forward to Book 7 because I truly love the Harry Potter series."
3,Disappointed,"After reading ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" I have only one comment to pass on and that is how disappointed I was by this book. So many story threads and characters that blossomed in Book 5 simply disappeared that it leads one to wonder if Rowling even wrote this book. What happened to Neville? The DA? The Order of the Phoenix? These well developed characters and plots were simply not picked up in Book 6. It makes oine wish that Hogwarts was a five year school and that Book 5 had been the last one. Please, JK, don't let us down like this in book 7!!"
1,Starts off smarmy and goes down hill...,Rowling starts off with a snide bashing of President Bush and it goes downhill from there. They only reason I finished this piece of garbage is because the end is in sight. If this even hinted at being as drawn out as Jordan's Wheel of Time I would have stopped following the series long ago.

1,More like Half-BloodLESS NON-Prince,"I know that there are way too many parents out there saying these books are demonic and a bad influence, and oh my word I've heard everything possible under the sun about the fricking influence. I have read enough of Harry Potter to make me puke up his glasses but when it comes to children there are only so many ones that are mature enough to handle the witchcraft and trickery that dominates these so-called stories. It's basically mass brainwashing but for the love of Pete, just be glad they are reading this instead of more openly liberal material. Yes, there are misguided attempts to lace a deomcratic ideal throughout, but that shouldn't be a problem if you know how to show your kids the truth about conservative republicanism."
2,Half Blood Prince Poser,"I don't think I can fully express my disappointment with this book. I eagerly awaited its release and spent hours slogging through its chapters anticipating the twists and surprises that never came. It seems as though someone else wrote this book, perhaps a child. This is not the story I fell in love with. The story I know is not predictable, unimaginative, linear, and trite. Could it be that we are expected now to read between the lines and concoct a hidden story line? Isn't there enough money in publishing? My friends and I are not, for a change, looking forward to the next Harry Potter Poser."
5,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,"Well me and shanika was at a book store and she like buy this book it looks cute so buy it. And so i did and i read it, it was awesome."
2,well lets just say.......,"Well to begin J.k. Rawling is a fantastic writer but, Harry's series to me is getting quite boring. I have elected to read this if I have the spare time but I keep finding more useful ways to spend it... To me this book is for younger adults-children but, I also believe that their is no such thing as a ""reading level"" also I do not mean to say that older men and women. The first 3 books where my favorites in this series so far 4 and 5 left me with a feeling regret and now 6. When the book can be summerized with a paragraph or more for other online reviews that means to me that there is not very much interesting detail in that particular book. Harry fans will scream and shout that im wrong many of my peers have already told me that, ""I have to read this book"". I would say if you LOVE Harry Potter get and read this book if you are like me however.....Your desicion.Bleh"
2,This book was an extreme let down!!,I have kept up with all the books and am a HUGE fan. I pre-ordered this book 4 months ago. I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next since book 5 was so exciting and really left you hanging. This book was the biggest let down. I nearly fell asleep several times while reading it. It was an absolute bore. What was she thinking? Of course I will still get the next book when it comes out. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't.
4,pretty good,"it was ok, learning about Voldemort was cool. she shouldn't have killed Dumbledore until the 7th book. but for most of the book i felt like, if i wanted a school story i would have gotten one! all in all, it was a decent book.Snape is good even if he killed Dumbledore. He didn't want to, and if you look at the clues you'll see Snape's not evil. Just mean. BUT HE IS LOYAL TO DUMBLEDORE!!!"
5,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (audio),"My son and I commute into the city Monday thru Friday. Our commute can last anywhere between 40-60 minutes each way. I bought the audio version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, for my son who is eight years old, to amuse him on the way to and from school. The experience we shared for the last few weeks were immeasurable. He and I discussed the characters and analyzed the plot when we were home in the evenings. The narrator Jim Dale is so awesome! Having read all the books myself, there is no way I could come up with all those voices. Lastly, in an age when children would rather watch T.V., play video games or go see a Harry Potter movie, this audio book helped my son realize that adventures are in books too."
5,Great car trip entertainment,"My family purchased this ""book on tape"" to entertain ourselves as we drove from Washington to California for Thanksgiving. My husband needed to catch up with the 11 year old and I before concluding the Harry Potter series.We have listened to all the Harry Potter cd's, and the series is one of the best books on tape I have ever heard. Jim Dale does a fabulous job with the voices and carries them over from book to book.Wonderful entertainment the whole family can enjoy!"
4,The fun one.,"Surprisingly, given its place after Voldemort has returned and just before the final battle, Book 6 is actually the lightest book of the series. Some of the set pieces (the two opening chapters, the Felix sequence, the kiss) are among the best in the entire series. The rest of the plot, though, is quite weak. The book is a fun enjoyable read, but it doesn't really feel like a full year, especially one in the middle of a war."
5,HP and the Half Blood Prince,I think this is one of the best of the series. Of course I love all the Harry Potter books. I'm not a youngster either. I'm 77 years old. My eyes aren't as good as they used to be and I was delighted to get this book in large print. I got my husband into it to and he read the series also and thought they were great. I can't say enough good things about them. Absolutely great!!!
2,I'm 17 actually,i read the first few lines of this book and the writing style is terrible. i almost felt embarassed for the author. i feel harry potter is so bad on purpose so as to lower ppls standards.
1,Dissapointment,I managed to read the book on Sunday and was throughly disapointed. Not sure if I will pick up #7.JK Rowling really let me down on this one as the plot really didn't go anywhere. There wasn't really enough to keep me engaged. I had to fight to finish it. It was quite a bit darker but a lot of what little plot there was was slightly predictable.Don't recommend this. Try going for one of the better classics like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or White's Once and Future King.
3,Disapointing,"I love HP and all of the books, but the more you get into it, the more complicated it gets. I liked the first ones where it was exciting and fun. Now theres more trouble, and more people are dying and theres not much to laugh at any more."
1,These are supposed to be Children's Book afterall!!,"This is the 6th and most offensive in this series. The obvious objective of this book is to create a plot line that will be successful in going from print to film. When this series first started it was exceptionally fun and exciting for the children it was written for and saisfying for adults seeking a pleasant escape from the harsh realities of today's world. This book's plot twists leaving us with a horrible ending and a ""new"" starting over for Harry, Hermonie and Ron is most sad, I cant imagine what damage it has done to the children it was supposedly written for. How can we possibly care what lies ahead for any of them."
1,halte au gaspillage du papier!!!,"i bought this book for my son timmy and after i read a little i decided not to give it to him but to return it to barnes and noble's. the character development is weak and the plot is too disjointed, the syntax is not precise, and the metaphors are laughably ameture. although harry seems a ok rolemodel for bullied kids perhaps, this tripe passed off as children's litterature is not going anywhere near my timmy! to be honest the second sentence made me laugh. i could write better than that when i was thirteen! buy your kid a science book so he can have a good job when he gets older, bc i forcast hardtimes in are anglo societies futures!"
2,Not as good as expected.,"It seemed that, compared to the previous books, that number six was written for the big screen. In the previous books a lot was happening within each chapter, this book, much more than the others was light on substance and does not hold your attention as like the others do. I was disappointed."
2,Decent read,"Falls rather flat in comparison to her previous books. Poorly written parts were a turnoff, as well as the overall lack of complexity and depth. Some parts seemed very unnatural and sort of slapped in there for the effect. Yet as her other 5 were very good, I think those and hopefully her 7th will redeem this average read."
2,VERY DEPRESSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I've been a HUGE fan of the harry potter books for years.However when they released this book and I read it I was totally shocked! For one they changed most of the character's personalities around way too much. But that is not the point. The point is in this latest harry potter guess who gets killed? Dumbledore does!In fact Snape kills him! And it didn't even tell at the end if Hogwarts was closing down or not. And it was very depressing at the end.Even if you are a harry potter fan beware of reading this. It is very depressing.
1,Overrated Overstated LACKING LACKING LACKING,"I love the Harry Potter Books. Book Seven bored me for 600 pages and then consequently pissed me off for 87. I was soooo looking forward to this, and now i'm just disapointed. Nothing MAGICAL ABOUT THIS BULL."
2,Billionaires don't make good writers!,"J.K.R took too long to write this and the result feels like too long of a chapter in a longer book. With Harry and company reaching young adult ages, this book is neither a children's book nor adult, and excites neither. She is detached and void of passion as the writer, as are the characters and the reader. Everyone is shows up for work with a job to do, and perform roles in a sales and marketing venture and get done with it, making her and the HP moneymaking machine another round of gold. The experience is underwhelming and disappointing, quite a waste of time :-("
2,Call me ...unfaithful... but-,"Before anyone bites my head off for the two star rating, I used to be the biggest HP fan in the world. I read the first five books straight in about a week. Then I got my hands on the sixth book. ""The Half-Blood Prince"". I thought it was just fine, up until Dumbledore ...well, you know. You can call me unfaithful at this point, but I WILL NOT read the seventh book because of Dumbledore's ...well, you know. Granted, I want to see the destruction of Voldemort through the finding of the Horcruxes, but really, NO DUMBLEDORE??? Unless he comes back or something stupid like that...no one can survive the Unforgivable Curse...except Harry. Maybe Dumbledore could too...wait. Maybe I will read the seventh book."
2,a long wait for a long drawn out book.,"Hi! I have read the other h.p. 5-6 x. this book was ok. it was not worth the two yrs wait to read it. the other books complement each other. this book does not. It a different book all together. it doesnot realy pick up were the others left off.what a few months before you buy it. you can get it for 2-3 $ thats how much i think this book is worth, the 3 movie made of hp was poo just like this book.with all the money rowing has made she can hire better writers and dictors."
1,Rowling must have drunk Felix Felicis when she went to publish this book,"What is the spirit of Harry Potter? Adventure, magic and surprises! Or should I say ""What WAS the spirit?""! What is the spirit now? ""Snog, snog and snog!"" Jeez, are they keep snogging each other even when they battle Voldemort? Will he even care? I think there are loads of books out there which are better than Harry Potter, like Deltora, Darren Shan, Artemis Fowl, Alex Rider etc. I think it's pure luck Harry Potter got so famous, and got four stars STILL for this book!"
4,good if you like books without action :) {:,"This book needed more action.I kinda liked it but harry needed to stop being a big baby.The books are clearly about Nevile!What made me laugh was when Dumbledore died lol!But you know what I dont think he really died,because remember he said to Malfoy,""I can make it look like you died & nobody will ever know.The good part was when Harry put the sectum sempra curse on Malfoy."
4,A pretty good book!,"This Harry Potter was probably my favorite so far. I have noticed that in every book, the characters get more realistic and have more issues. One part I thought was corny, though, was when ""there was a monster inside Harry that woke up when Ginny was around."" All the same, it was a fullfilling book with lots of exciting moments."
1,Losing its magic.,"To paraphrase Lemony Snicket, if you like happy endings you should throw down this book when you get to page 500 and run far, far from it. Not satisfied with the killing of Cedric Diggery in Book 4 and Harry's Godfather, Sirius Black, in Book 5, J.K Rowling outdoes herself with Book 6's bummer of an ending. The book is a delight to read for 500 pages, and it has some of the funniest and most entertaining dialogue in the series. But the ending disapporates all that, leaving young readers (and this not so young reader) thoroughly frustrated and disappointed."
1,Surprisingly Horrid!,"Before reading the book, rip out the first half. You won't miss any of the plot, but you'll save yourself the shear boredom of reading about endless ""snogging"", petty complaining and actions by the major characters, unjustifiable brutality by the good guys, a rambling pathetic writing style and weird political statements. Even in the second half, though, the writing is sub standard. I've never seen so many semi-colons in one book before. It looks like it was written with a brain dead grammar checker. With as much money the publisher made on this series, they could have afforded to hire a competent proof reader or editor. It is obvious that this book was hashed out with no regard for quality because they knew it would sell big even if it was garbage."
1,total dissapointment,"what a downturn in writing style, and plot for Rowling. The story does not kick in till the last 3 chapters of a very long book, and still fails to show any new developments. If it wasn't raining out here, what a waist of my Saturday, after being such an avid HP fan."
1,The book plot is not as interesting as the last 5 books.,The book plot is not as interesting as the last past 5 books. I am very disappointed with this book.
2,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,This book is too long and unfocused. The editors should have elimated fringe characters such as Kreatcher.
2,"Great when it worked, not so great with smoke and fire :(","I've owned the machine for 3 years and it has received periodic home use. I've been very pleased with its suction & cleaning ability. Cleaning the machine after use is challenging given the weight of the machine & the narrow openings. I used it yesterday for some large area rugs and it was great, cleaned the machine, and went to use it today on some additional area rugs. 5 minutes into the new job smoke poured out of the machine followed by flames. One rug is wet and soapy, but I guess we're done! Guess I'll try a Hoover next time :("
1,"Quality so poor, other features pale in comparison","The pros: Wow! This guy can clean. I had a Hoover steam vac for 4 years, and I saw the difference immediately.The cons: Trouble trouble trouble. I got the vac & the hose was bent. No prob. A trip to the shop. Then on 3rd use the suction stopped working and water sprayed constantly on my rugs. Another trip to the shop. Problem solved for 1/2 room, then it started up again. Back to the shop. Problem fixed. I was able to steam vac 2 rooms, then the motor started running and smelling and no water would come out at all. I called Bissell. Got a free vac. (Thanks Bissell!) The new vac's Power Drive was broke. I steam vaced one room, then the suction stopped working. Sigh. I'm going to try to get my money back.In summary - a good design but they need to spend more time listening to their quality assurance department (if they have one)."
1,Watch out for the brush drive,"It cleans well when it works... I clean once a week on about 400 square feet of regular carpet for 19 months. I've had 4 of the $10 belts that drive the pump break. The pump and the brush are all part of the same unit. The plastic used for the brush drive wheel is very cheap and has failed on me 3 times. It only cost $40 for that part. Since you have to replace it all. None of this counts labor, which I do myself. The store that I get the parts from have know which parts fail by heart. Also for them it is a great money maker with people bringing in broken machines at least 3 times a week. It cleans carpets well, along with cleaning out your wallet. I would strong suggest you look else where for your next vaccum."
5,PERFECT QUALITY MACHINE!!,"I used this Bissell 7950 Cleaner the day I first got it just a few days after ordering! It was a breeze to put together and Wonderfully easy to use! I was very suprised how easy it was to manuever and I did not realize what a terrific job it did on my carpets until the next 2 days I decided to vacume and see what a difference it made! OMG! It is AMAZING!! I did not pick up hardly anything but a little fuzz, I used the Allergy Formula Cleaning Solution and It is just Fresh and Clean. This is one Cleaner I would recommend to Everyone and I would only have one complaint that the Bissell company needs to change, *make the tank a 2 gal. tank* it does get tiresome going to the sink so many times to empty and fill this 1 gal. tank."
1,wouldn't buy again,We have had this machine for about a year and it might have work right the first time we used it. We now have to borrow a friends Hoover Steamvac when we need to clean the carpet. We are getting ready to buy a different machine bcause this one would never work right. It never has any suction power and it constantly sprays soap everywhere even if you have it only on the water selection. I wouldn't buy.
2,Bad machine,"It requires assembly and it's not simple, some parts couldn't be snap in place. The machine feels solid but the pump belt is cheap. The belt broke after the second use. It has lot of power when it works."
1,Worst steam cleaner ever!,I bought this product 1 year ago and have already replaced 5 parts. Two of which were major parts. I will deffinitely buy a Hoover the next time. I had a Hoover and it lasted many years without repairs. This is what happens when you try something different.
1,Miss my Hoover,"Broke after 1 cleaning plus 1 spot repair. I won't pay to have it repaired if not covered under warranty. Will buy a Hoover again. Bissell can kiss my, er, carpet!"
3,Great but doesn't last,"This Bissell like other Bissels I've owned work great at first, but they don't live very long. The design includes weak areas made of brittle plastic that break after some use. It is also very hard to clean out carpet fuzz and pet hair that enters the nozzle."
1,Control Freaking Clogger,"Was only able to use this ""ONCE"" and then the machine clogged. The repair estimated at $135+Pros*Hot water*Cleans wellCons*Clogs very easily*Restricted to authorized repair centers*Consumer cannot repair (is this rocket science?)*Maintenance costs $135+ almost half the original cost of the unit*Restricted to Bissell cleaning products to prevent clogging (supposedly)I expected to get a machine that I could use for several cleanings. I think Bissell got it right with the heated steam cleaning, but needs to address the clogging issue and not be a ""control freak"". It is ok if consumers want the freedom to choose their own cleaning products or want to option to repair their own unit. Design, design, design, Bissell please make a better mouse trap that does not trap the consumer."
3,Language and some references a problem,"The stories in this book & Minerva Clark Goes to the Dogs are great! BUT, there is language that is inappropriate (in my opinion) in both. It's a real bummer to have a guy yell, ""you BI*CH!"" in the early chapters. At that point my dd and I stopped (she's in 6th gr.).While I know that language exists I don't think it's appropriate for her age. I think it is more appropriate for HS students. It's too bad bc the story is entertaining. I just wish that it could've been written a little ""cleaner"".We'll revisit Minerva and her adventures in a couple of years."
1,Never received the correct item,"I don't have an opinion about this item, because the vendor kept mailing me the wrong product."
3,Not Very Extensive,"While the book has many of the band's hits, it is also missing quite a few. It attempted to include songs from the 80s after the band's height of popularity passed. I would have preferred more of their its from the late 70's when they were performing and writing at their peak."
5,Practical and Readable Guide for Growth,"Marian Volkman has created an excellent tool for inner growth. She presents simple, practical, and extremely useful skills anyone can use to improve one's self, relationships, and environment around them. Highly recommended.On a daily basis I utilize an excellent concept I picked up from this book: I am able to embrace and appreciate the beauty in objects, people, and things around me without having to make them my possessions. This one concept has provided a great deal of serenity and peace. Just this one practical tool has changed my life. Practice all the exercises and reap the benefits that are in store for you."
2,challenging game..but the super nintendo version is far better :),"this is a good batman game..its just a tad too difficult LOL the graphics are dark and gloomy perfect for batman but they lack the visual detail of the movie but a good job by sega :) now the super nintendo's batman returns is a excellent game which i still play to this day..the graphics are well done.. the music is from the movie..and had digitized scenes from the film.. the other batman game that is really done right is by sunsoft ..:Batman the video game"" from the 89 movie again for the genesis.. all in all if your a batman fan get all of these games.."
1,A terrible video game,"I don't know about the other incarnations of Batman Returns, but the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version is downright atrocious. The controls are stiff and slow, Batman himself moves at a snails pace and is frequently unable to move out of the way of oncoming enemies. The sound effects are awful and the combat system is very, very poor. Such a shame consideringBatmanwas so good. Even the music in this one disappoints in comparison to the brilliant tunes in the first game. The only positive thing I can mention about this waste of time and effort are the nice looking graphics which really evoke the gloomy, wintry feel of a frozen Gotham City. Otherwise, avoid!Graphics B-Sound DGameplay FLasting Appeal D-"
4,The best Lithuanian language course currently available,"This is the best guide (book plus tape) currently available for learning Lithuanian. My brother, who studied at Vilno Universiteto in 1994 - 1995 strongly recommended it to me, and wished he had had it available then. I had previously tried to learn using the Easy Way to Lithuanian book and tapes, and found this much better.Of course, learning Lithuanian without living there or with a Lithuanian family member is basically impossible, but such is life.Su Diev!"
3,Not for printers,"I thought this product would be a good buy because of its adaptability, but most of all I needed it for my printer. This USB does not work with my printer however I will refrain from giving it a low score simply because most of the attachments DO work. I haven't figured out why it does not work with the printer though.*Also it is kinda flimsy and most of the time does not re-wrap its cord"
5,Body and Soul: The Legends of Soull Live,"This is a great five star dvd of 60's/70's music stars performing at their peak. Very good video and 5.1 sound, that will have you up dancing and singing. I highly recommend it."
4,Good live music,"The music and musicians included here were fun to watch and nice to listen to. One of the best features is having the opportunity to see some less well known musicians perform music I heard many times growing up, but hardly knew the artist (Ben E King, Rufus Thomas, Brook Benton...) I'm good with this purchase."
3,If... Review for a book,This book helps teens express their feelings about stuff they don't even think about. But some questions in this book most teens think are lame. This book should have been more researched on what teens are interested in today. Good book but should be more up to date.
3,Little too Teen Bop/ Tiger Mag Quiz Like,I bought this book to have questions for my 14-15 year old campers. Over half the questions were really superficial. I was hoping for deeper questions. I could see this book being really fun for middle school girls. I would have liked this book in 6th or 7th grade. Though a few things are dated.
2,Got what I paid for,"Not very good, but considering what you can pick it up for, it wasn't a complete waste. There were funny moments, but as a biker myself, I couldn't really appreciate this movie and the idiotic portrayal of all Bikers."
2,stupid movie,"I thought it would be more serious. but they made it stupid.thought it,d be more informative.but it was all fake stuff."
5,Nice B movie of the 60'd biker gang,"Northern California 1967, Archie also known as Bad Trip is a newly inducted member of a 60's biker gand known as The Cannibals. After stealing a bike from one of the members, Archie is given 30 minutes to escape after which he will be hunted by the gang."
4,A great accessory,This is the perfect book for those interested in drawing fantasy or super hero poses. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the quality of the images themselves could have been better.
4,very helpful,"Asked to give no more than two hours on this Gospel, I found this commentary particularly helpful to reinforce and update what I had learned several years ago."
1,Feminist Fundamentalism Masquerading as Catholicism,"Doctrinaire feminists - folks who don't like the title and term of address ""Father"" for God, who refuse to use the masculine pronoun ""He"" for God, who prefer goofy ""inclusive"" euphemisms like ""the Human One"" for ""the Son of Man,"" and who despise anything smacking of ""patriarchy"" - will love this none-to-subtle attempt at subtle feminist propaganda. For those looking for more objective - and more orthodox! - Catholic commentary on St. Matthew's Gospel, I'd highly recommend ""The Gospel of Matthew,"" the new addition to the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture Series, by Curtis Mitch and Edward Sri."
1,I'll NEVER buy again,"I bought these because it says ""STRONG"" right on the box, and wow is that false advertising. Half the trash bags already had small tears in them before we started to put anytihng in them, and the rest all ripped the minute anything was added to the bag. Seriously, we were not being rough with them or putting sharp objects in, these are just the cheapest bags I've ever seen. Glad should be ashamed, I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Crappy thin and small product,Not worth it even if they were free. Not big enough for a regular 30 gal barrel. Plastic is so thin you can see though it.
3,NOT HAPPY,"THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD ONLY THEY SHOULD WARN YOU IF YOU ORDER THIS RIGHT NOW IT WILL TAKE ABOUT A MONTH TO ARRIVE.I HAVE BOUGHT THIS BEFORE THEY WORK WELL,GOOD PRICE.IN THE PAST THEY ONLY TOOK A FEW DAYS TO ARRIVE.I ORDERED THESE A FEW DAYS AGO,WENT TO CHECK ON COMP WHY THEY WERENT HERE,IT SAYED IT WOULD ABOUT A MONTH LATER,IT DOESNT SAY THAT WHEN YOU ORDER SO I CANCELED MY SHIPMENT,DONT KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT MY GARBAGE CANT WAIT A MONTH.I WONT BE ORDERING THIS HERE AGAIN,ILL ORDER FROM ANOTHER WEBSITE."
1,Trash bags for the wealthy?!?,"These are my favorite garbage bags, but the price made me laugh out loud, and that was before I saw the shipping charge. The total price would be more than twice the list price and close to four times what I normally pay locally.I hope that Amazon usually sells these at a reasonable price, but they are out of stock, so this particular merchant gets the slot. At least I got a giggle out of looking this time."
4,FRIENDS FOREVER!!,"This is a story of four women who are now 45 yrs. old and have been very best friends since first grade. Pamela is the only one of the four who is still married. Mary Sue, Gretchen, and Debbie each had a husband who left them for other women, leaving them devastated and lonely....On Mary Sue's 45th birthday celebration at the lakefront home of Debbie's family where they have spent many happy hours since childhood, unbeknownst to Mary Sue, her boyfriend has an accident and disappears. This secret is shared by her three friends.....The friends have gone through many ups and downs in their lives and have each been there for each other all these many years......Will this secret tear them apart at this time of their lives when they are trying to rebuild their shattered lives?.....Mary Sue is trying to survive cancer and Pamela, even though she is married has not been happy in her marriage to a very controlling husband......Read this book and find out what happens to these friends."
2,Not the best book,"This book failed to 'draw me into' the story. I stopped about half way through it - not wanting to waste my time finishing it. I did, however - pick it up a month later and finsh. The second half was better than the first, I thought."
5,A Lovely Friendship Saga,"All of these women will touch you in a special way when you begin reading this book. There is a mystery element that adds a twist that the reader does not expect and I was vastly entertained while reading this story. Sad, witty, inspirational, and endearing, THE GIRLFRIENDS CLUB is a must read for all women!"
4,Insightful,"This book contains some useful information on how God speaks through our lives and our prayer. I discovered that I was already listening to God, but didn't associate it with actually listening. I bought this book hoping for some step by step method of how to stop my business and listen - something I really have problems with. But what I discovered instead is that God speaks through my business - I just have to be able to recognize his voice.I also appreciated the section on the Psalms. Overall a great little book and I recommend it to all those people who struggle with listening."
5,A great source of creative and inspiring prayers!,"Although now out of print, there are used copies available, and I highly recommend this wonderful book by Fr. Edward Hays. My copy, which a dear friend sent to me many years ago is now dog eared and worn from much use.I have borrowed and adapted many of these prayers for use in a vast variety of liturgies, both in my parishes and at home. Fr. Hays' creative use of words will stimulate your own creativity and open your soul to the Holy Spirit.Fr. Hays has a new book out which I also highly recommend:Chasing the Joy, Musings on Life in a Bittersweet WorldActually, I have found everything I have read by Hays to be filled with such a richness that I stand in awe of his writing and the many gifts God has given him.The Rev. Dr. Prentice Kinser III, Author ofLIMITLESS LIVING, A Guide to Unconventional Spiritual Exploration and Growth"
3,A slow read and the title is a bit deceiving,"The title is a bit deceiving. I thought this was primarily going to be about the background and actual crossing of the Delaware. But, that event played only a minor part. Although wonderfully researched and full of great information, I found it to be quite slow at times."
5,What can I say that hasn't been said,"As an avid early American Historian, I place this book in my top three. This is must reading. The facts are told as they were, through the primary characters and you are there during the end of the mini ice age crossing the Delaware. Like MJ's last shot against Utah, if it didn't really happen, we would all just chalk it up to a Hollywood fairytale.I read McCullough's 1776 after this and there is no comparison.This book is so vivid and palpable that I felt obligated to go follow the trail of those early warriors. Amazing!My other two favorites are Chernow's Hamilton and Gotham."
2,Some useful information,"I was very disappointed in this book. While the author has some decent analysis of the strategy and strategic reassessments on both sides of the war, his numerous detours from the main narrative were clunky and very distracting. Why was space dedicated to the so-called first American ""feminist""? Additionally, his writing style made this book seem like an overly long term paper. In comparison to Robert Middlekauff's work, or similar works by Joseph Ellis, this book reads very poorly."
3,Washington's Crossing,"I purchased this book base on recommendations of other reviews.I found the book factual but was difficult to follow the action because of shortage of maps.Even with the maps present it was difficult to follow the text using the map.Also the organization wasn't as fluid as I would expect.That said, the book was well researched and provided me a clearer understanding of what Washington endured and how much we owe this gentleman."
4,A Gem of a Book,"The author draws you into the book through Emmanuel Leutze's painting; ""Washington Crossing the Delaware"". Fischer does a commendable narrative. He then sets the reader up to a descriptive look at the various battles the Continental Army had with the British and German soldiers. Fischer pulls the reader into the terrain to get a grasp of the fighting conditons.You get a glimpse of General George Washington, the book describes Washington's background and his character. Fischer tells about his leadership and compare's that of the English in the war. There are direct parallels to the leadership in the founding of our nation that continues today.The book at times becomes a bit of a slough at times, it's all about the details when a book is this well researched.I have the Kindle Touch. It's much easier to use your finger to enlarge the photograph. With the footnotes, it was harder to use my finger to get that note."
5,One of the best books out there!,"I'll start by saying that it took me only three days to read this book, cover to cover; I couldn't put it down! Exciting narrative, well researched, and a must read for everyone!"
5,Very thorough in its details,"This is a great book that gives signinificant historical insight into the battles of 1776 and early 1777. It describes the attitudes and opinions of both sides that were unwilling to compromise in 1776. It gives a seemingly first hand account of the Battles of Boston, NY, Trenton, and Princeton. The book provides great details on the key figures of the Battles and how events unfolded. This book has a great flow to it and it had a lot of the details I was looking for."
5,Making Pictures From Historical Facts!,"As a lover of GW, this book is one of the best!The detail presented makes one think the author wasthere. Amazing the luck involved that helped thiscountry gain independence. A great read!"
5,Washington's Crossing,Well written with research that debunks many of the legends that surround the 1st battle at Trenton. Also a good interweaving of the individual stories with the larger political and military situation.
5,Washington's Monument-al feat!,"Fantastic, exciting true tale of one of the most well known legends in the history of this country - only, it's not a legend. Dr. Fischer goes to great and convincing lengths immediately in the book to make this point clear. I have no problem with revisionist history, as long as it brings to light the uncovered or supressed details of what we hold sacred as historical truth. This book is revisionist history in that fashion, and it reinforces the facts behind the legend. With his excellent reference list, and his ability to place the reader at the site of the drama of the events, this book is a believable and authentic narrative of what happened during this pivotal and desperate year in American history."
4,Great examination of a pivotal American period,"What I know about the revolutionary period of American history was mostly stereotypes and flashes of scenes. This book starts with the stereotypical scene - the one pictured, of Washington's crossing - and dives deep into these moments. It's written in a compelling fashion, gives us an excellent overview of the various forces and their cultures, and explores deeply the battles that led up to the moment of the Crossing (to give context) as well as the aftermath (why it was important). Great book."
5,Wonderful,"Five stars to David Fischer for this fantastic book on the New York/New Jersey campaign. There is a considerable amount of material that was new to me including the foraging wars (post Trenton battles) and the second battle of Trenton (as the author calls it). Both of these battles seem much more significant than the first battle of Trenton after Washington crossed the Delware, but decide for yourself. Very readable. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History. A myriad of references and appendices."
3,good but lightweight,"Essentially this sketches some early battles of the Revolutionary War such as New York, and then covers in depth the battles of Trenton and Princeton, surprise American successes. There is some good anecdotal stuff here on Washington's style of command and the opposing Hessian and British commanders. However this is perhaps not the BIG BOOK others suggest and reads more like an extended essay, complete with some annoying repetition. If you're looking for something with more grissle, try Chernow's Alexander Hamilton, which has good stuff on the war plus shedloads more....."
2,Where is a ghost writer when you need one?,"I believe it was easier to cross the Delaware in winter than to get through this book. I just read 1776 by David McCullough, loved it, and was interested in reading more. Fischer is one of the dullest writers I've read. It is painfully obvious that being a successful academic and a successful writer are not necessarily connected."
2,Dry Dry Dry...,"Fischer does a good job chronicling the events around Washington's early campaigns in the Revolution. But it wastruly painful to slog through his dry, dry prose.I am from Arizona, where it's pretty dry, but this bookmake me reach for a drink of water faster than a 120 degree day!"
2,Not overly useful,I bought the book because the reviews were good but I was very disappointed with the book because it doesn't really cover anything you couldn't just find on the Internet. Each topic is covered in like 2 paragraphs. There is not much substance in this book.
2,not thorough enough,"This book tries to cover land trust, C, S, SP, GP, LP, LLC, estate planning, asset protection, and more in 100 pages. Go figure.I find it touches on all the subjects, but none of the subjects was covered thorough enough. None of the entities was explained in detail to give the reader a complete understand.I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who's new to the concept.But it does cover most of the ideas of asset protection, and has a good collection of legal forms. So it might be a good addition to somebody who knows what he's doing, but just need a quick reference. This is why it's a 2 star, instead of 1.So, pick your place."
2,Not what I expected,This book skims over everything. I have two other books on the subject that are much more informative. Didn't see anything in here that made it a must read for realestate investors. Very disappointed.
1,Very little practical value,"I bought this book thinking that it would provide some practical REAL information and examples of asset protection. Basically, this book is all smoke and mirrors and never comes close to detailing exactly 'how' to accomplish any of the 'ideas' that are floated by the author. Most information is presented as a glossary of what something means...who needs that? Skip this book and save yourself the $18.95 plus shipping...it is not worth the money!"
5,a very under estimated little book,"Knowing the author Richard Behrens from my longtime practice in martial arts, I bought this book for a friend.Having red this book, I'm sure I can beat his 15 year of golfexperience. While I have never played!!"
5,Great book.,You have to know how to benefit from this book. Everybody can teach technique but this man teaches you about your mind.
1,STOP THE INSANITY!,"Hey, I got an idea, maybe someone could write a book on a subject they know something about? Nah, that would make too much sense. Richard Behrens knows nothing about the game of golf. Chances are he knows nothing about Martial Arts. At first I thought this was going to be something like ""Zen in the art of motorcycle maintance"". But that would be like comparing the ""Bible"" to ""Bert and Ernie go to the park"". Throw this book in the trash."
1,ARE YOU SERIOUS?,"I love Golf, This book should be banned from the bookstore of life! I have never read such garbage in all my years. I am using the book right now, to wedge open my basement door! Smells rotten!"
1,Doesn't Work,"Fantasy, all alot of fantasy. You can tell the author has never played a round of golf in his life"
3,"""Artistic"" rather than informative","Billy Name was there and has one-zillion photographs from which to choose, so I was truly disappointed by the ""artistic"" crud he chose to print. I wanted to see real photographs of real people, not how clever he was at ""conveying the feeling"" of the time. I resent this book because it could've been so much better. I didn't buy it to see Name's artistic view of a momentary, yet monumental, era. I bought it hoping I could study people's faces, stances, outfits, the background. I wanted to study the pictures and respond to them all by myself without the photographer hammering me with images amounting to dogma. I mean, the Empire State Building? Yeah, that's really deep and cuts to the heart of things. Name needs to share, not hoard. But lucky for us all, he was there with a camera and actually took pictures. And of all the Warhol set, Name's autobiography would be one of the most interesting."
2,"Location, location, ...","... location. If you'd been there, you probably could have taken a collection of photographs of at least equal caliber. What matters in these photos is who is in them, with little apparent attention to the construction of the shots.So if you'd like to see mediocre photographs but of extraordinary 2nd Factory regulars at that Factory as well as Max's Kansas City and Central Park, this may be your book. It may beat looking at nothing, they may bring you back to a special time.The value for me lies in a 13 page interview with Billy Name. If you are trying to understand the mysteries of Warhol and his Factories, Billy Name would be a great source of information. Think silver.You can also (September 2005) see Billy Name photos, mostly black and white, at his web site. He also has some interviews there he was the subject of."
2,Missed the mark,"I am a Nevada Barr fan and was unfortunately disappointed with ""High Country."" The story takes place in a restaurant (boring). The characters were dull and I kept getting them confused. Anna's constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome. I also missed Anna's sister, Molly, who is only mentioned a few times in the book.Sorry, but I really can't recommend this book as a good read. If you want to get a feel for a real Anna Pigeon adventure, pick up ""Track of the Cat"" or ""Liberty Falling."""
4,My first Nevada Barr mystery.,"Decided to try a new author based on my love for Yosemite National Park. Although this story didn't do justice to the beauty and grandeur of Yosemite's glacier-carved peaks and valleys, it was an enjoyable read. Barr's writing style is fast-paced and keeps you turning the pages to find out what happens next. I liked the protagonist, undercover park ranger Anna Pigeon, and can't wait to read more of her adventures in other national parks."
2,"Unbelievable action story, not Barr's best","This is certainly not the best Nevada Barr book out there. In fact, it's in the running for the worst one, but I have others yet to read. The characters are thin and the plot predictable.This is not a book for mystery lovers, though if you like action-adventure movies the final third of the book is for you. Like the movies, though, the events were unbelievable and the heroine should have been dead several times over. Even so, I kept reading, which is how this book squeezed out that second star.I was also surprised that Barr seems to dislike Yosemite so much. Even more puzzling, she keeps praising the Natchez Trace Parkway, which is not exactly a crown jewel of the national park system. To each her own, I guess."
3,Not her best,I have read everyone of Nevada Barr's book And they have been wondrful but High Country wasn't. It took forever to get going & then when it did half of what Anna goes through is so unbelieveable. I did finish the book and it was ok but not up to par.
2,"Overwritten, underedited","I was so disappointed with High Country. I've liked Nevada Barr in the past, and I love Yosemite, so I was looking forward to a good read, but I couldn't get past about page 50. WAY too many serious errors early that the editors didn't catch (including a ""whomever"" for ""whoever"" on p. 22) as well as overwriting on Ms. Barr's part. I really expected more from this major writer, and from her major publisher."
5,Great Gift!,"I got this unabridged Nevada Barr CD/novel for an avid Anna Pigeon Mystery fan...and it ""fit the bill"" as a satisfying gift to give. The Giftee was mighty pleased."
4,Could've been more engaging to the reader,"I'm a relatively new fan of Nevada Barr's and have read ""High Country"" as well as one or two other in the Anna Pidgeon series she created. Anna is a likable character, but she pales in comparison to Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta. Anna is trying to solve the disappearance of four hikers in Yosemite National Park in this novel. However, she spends a disproportionate amount of time behaving like she doesn't know anything about anything when in fact she is an EMT and a National Park Ranger. Going undercover doesn't mean leaving your brain behind. Most of the action takes place late in the novel. Barr's descriptions of the characters and the park are spot-on; she made me want to book a trip via Expedia when I was done reading. However, I'm not so sure I'll take another (book) journey with Anna Pidgeon anytime soon."
4,"crisp plot, less sense of character than her others","I have read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon mysteries. This one offers some very tense action sequences, delivers less of Anna Pigeon's rueful observations than usual. Still, well worth reading."
1,"Low Country, Maybe","This book is just plain awful. I love Yosemite and my son works at the Ahwahnee restaurant, so I bought this book hoping for a connection to the story. What a waste of time. I am not even sure Ms. Barr has been to Yosemite. Her descriptions of the park were so generic they could have come right out of Fodors.There is nothing compelling about this story, the characters are cardboard cut-outs, Anna Pigeon herself is distracting the way she continually has little mental asides that have nothing to do with the story. If this book is indicative of the rest of the Anna Pigeon series then the praise I have been reading in other reviews is misplaced.Nevada Barr missed some wonderful opportunities to include all of the truly majestic features of Yosemite in her story and instead we get drivel. What a disappointment."
3,surprised by bad reviews,"I am generally hard to please (see my other reviews), this was my first book by Nevada Barr and I found it pretty satisfying. There are some minor problems and some pieces do not fit well enough, but the action is going, the author provides some clues, but it is really hard to figure the mystery out and there is some thrilling action."
1,thesaurus walts,"Anna Pigeon is a great gal, but in this latest installment of her life, the horrors she endures at 50 roll off her too easily to be at all believable. Her physical ordeal in the dark and freezing mountains alone would be enough to make even quite hardy people need a few days of rest. But good old Anna, tender of heart thogh she is, is hardly phased by the violence, the suffering, the nastiness she encounters in this book, even though Barr allows a sentence or two of quick, sentimental reflection from time to time. And I wonder how some of the other sentences would have turned out had Barr not had her thesaurus handy - plethora used too many times, not withstanding! I enjoy the excitement of improbable fiction as well as the next person, but this offering is just too silly for credibility."
3,OK But Good be Better,"This manual is done in a very stilted British style - ""tick over"" vs idle. Some related info could be placed in the same area compared to guiding you through a process and then referring to another section. This is typical in many of these manuals, but I found here that the area that's referred to wasn't as continuous as if they kept it with the original area. This only has to do with the more minor operations. For the price it's worth having in your repair library."
3,Sonin DT210 InchMate Pro,"My two year old D210 InchMate Pro just died. Worked fine one day, sat on my workshop table overnight and wouldn't turn on the next day. Didn't drop it, no static discharge. A hard reset and a new battery didn't help. Dead.Pros: Will handle calculations in increments as small as 1/64 inch. Pretty nifty conversion between units, including yards, feet, inch decimal, inch fraction, and metric.Cons: Uses a special $3.00 CR2016 3V lithium battery. Inputting fractions is a bit tedious . If you input a fractional number and then input an integer or decimal number without also specifying the units of the second number (inch, meter, etc.) the calculator displays an error message that you cannot recover from. You have to clear everything and re-enter ALL your numbers over again."
4,Slow in math?,"Can't beat the accuracy and speed for various calculations needed. They show all functions ""step by step"" in simple format. I wish they had these instructions on line to print at larger scale for easier reading."
4,gooood,it's fair good. The only thing i consider is Made from Taiwan...but after use it i feel no problem!
5,I love this camera,"I just got my camera for Christmas and I love it. The quality is great, and it's so lightweight! Gotta have it if you're into photography...great starter camera."
3,Needs e-book format,"The book that was required for a class and the best thing I can say about it is that it's inexpensive. The material is boilerplate and not unique, and presented in a dry method that doesn't inspire. At least with an eBook edition, it can be parsed for relevant information."
5,Learning in action,this was a great transaction. The item was shipped immediately and I would deff buy from this person again!
2,Questionable at best...,"As a die-hard Joni fan, I look forward to all new Joni-related projects, whether created by the goddess herself or others. But this one is questionable at best. While not an unpleasant listen (if only as 'background' music), the genuine Mitchell devotee will likely find these covers bland and inadequate. The cover of Chinese Cafe (while offering an acceptable orchestration) is pretty dreadful. It's odd that the performing artists aren't even listed on the liner notes (well, there are no liner notes, really). Perhaps that is why the price is so low. I guess this one has two valid prospective groups of buyers: Joni fans who just have to have all Mitchell-related work or are curious about it; and people who like Joni Mitchell songs but don't like her voice (imagine!)."
1,blasphemy,"There are certain labels, such as Dressed to Kill and Red Eye, that put out so called ""Tribute"" albums, which are nothing more than unnamed artists covering songs. These artists are always the worst, with absolutly no talent whatsoever. Then, the label pays [local store] or another chain to place their cd in the same section as the real artists', so that an unattentive shopper will mistake the BS cd for a real one. This is one of those CDs. Do not purchase it under any circumstances."
3,Hey It's Not That Bad!,Well I picked up my copy in a 3 CD's for one euro in Berlin and I rather like it. As a long term Joni fan I like to hear cover versions and these ones are largely fine. In fact I really enjoyed 'You Turn Me On' and 'Help Me.' And 'Both Sides Now' and 'River' are fine versions too. If you can get it cheap it's worth a listen..
3,Disappointing compared to Common Stocks,"This book may be valuable to an investor who wants to learn more about investing during the 1960s; however, it did not supply as much valuable detail as Common Stocks and Uncommon profits.I read this book because of the Warren Buffet quote, ""I am an eager reader of whatever Phil has to say, and I recommend him to you."" If you are interested in a how-to investing book, this book is not for you. However, if you are interested in learning as much as possible about the investing environment of the 1960s this book may of some value.I gave this book 3 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed 2-3 of the five sections of the book."
4,review,"Not the breakthrough in qualitative analysis Common Stock and Uncommon Profits was. Still a great read and this has many ideas to offer. A few great ""how to "" stories, of particular enjoyment to me is the story about the Dr., his expensive wives, and a bit of capital."
1,Unnecessary to read,"Skip this book. Not useful in any sense.Do not buy this because you liked 'common stocks & uncommon profits"".Totally disappointing diary like write up of no-longer-relevant events."
4,a bible for your investment,"it is a very good book, very helpful to individual investors. it can be regarded as a bible for investment if you want to be the kind of Warren Buffet."
1,"Pompous and pretentious, histrionic artiface","I was very disappointed with this book. From the opening line to the last, I was haunted by a desparate sense that my time was being needlessy and fruitlessly wasted. But I wanted to give the author a chance, so I read the book to the end. It never redeemed itself. It was a plastic examination of a grand social ill. If you want a realistic examination of childhood abuse, you'd be better off watching an organist play at Sunday church. That's how far off the mark this pseudo-intellectual exercise truly is. I strongly recommend you do not waste your valuable time on this rubbish."
3,Not a great deal.,Got this generator last year the morning after Katrina hit out area and the power was out. Bought it mostly because there wasn't much to choose from at Home Depot and for the Porter Cable name.Most generators this size & wattage usually come with a 30A generator extension cord included. Have had not problems with it. I just think there are better deals on generators with more features for the money.
3,Great Price,"I can't believe that this keyless remote is so cheap. call Ford dealership and they want a whole lot more for the exact something. I order two and they were so easy to program, it took less than a minute to program them. I highly recommend saving your money and getting them on Amazon! Just a warning one of the remotes battery already died but that's a quick fix!***UPDATED REVIEW ***** it's been about 7 months since i purchased theses remotes. They no longer work. i've changed the batteries still don't work. i emailed the company, i would think they would last longer than 7 months. they emailed me back and pretty much said to bad so sad. there is only a 60 day guarantee."
4,All the basics,It teaches you all you need to know to begin with Robotics. It's a bit old-fashioned though.
4,Great introduction to robotics.,"As the title says, it's an introduction. And a good one at that. The basics are covered with just the right amount of detail to be useful. The book also provides good references for more advanced work."
3,Great book for beginners!,"Yes...it is a good book! No doubts about that. For the basics that is. There will be a limit if you would like to pursue more on this topic.All in all, the chapters are well presented and the assigments well documented."
4,review for Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control (2nd Edition),Item was shipped and in great condition except for a few highlight marks.
5,Great book,Enjoyed reading it and would recommend to anyone who is interested in UFO phenomenon. Reality of other planets' inhabitants is real in my opinion and hard to ignore so many facts.
3,Ok book for beginners,"This is an Ok book for mechanical engineers interested in learning the basics of mechatronics. The book provides a very basic introduction of electronic devices and gives the reader a flavor of the field of mechatronics. However, if you are a seasoned engineer with a basic understanding of electrical engineering, you will need something else.In my opinion, this book has been written at a level that is appropriate for junior engineering students and it is not suitable for a practicing engineer with some real-world experience."
4,Love it!,"The book was more than I expected it to be. But there were also some disappointing aspects of it. It is beautiful, with gorgeous illustrations and creative information tidbits about herbs and other assorted things. But there is not a whole lot of things to fill in about milestones, and I don't think theres enough room for photos. I have another baby book where I have recorded all my daughter's milestones, so I am now planning to use both books since I need both to record all my baby's most precious moments. Both pleased as well as a tad bit disappointed, I would definitly recommend this book...not for the milestone value but for the beauty of it. Very creative, very unique."
5,It Ain't Braggin' If'n It's True...,"John Willingham's Book of Barbecue is the best treatise on this subject I've ever read. For novices as well as seasoned chefs, this book will open up the world of good 'Q to the reader. John's down-home sensibilities, in addition to his correct recipes and instructions (are you listening, Martha Stewart? ) will bring the best in barbecue to your table. And if you're in Memphis (especially in May) make an extra effort to visit John's restaurant (Willingham's) and meet the man behind the book."
5,This is one terrific and amazing barbecue book.,"For some time, I have been looking for one barbecue book that I could really trust and turn to over and over again. This is it! This is barbecue the way it should be. All the recipes I have tried are delicious and work really well. The book has great ideas for foods that complement your barbecue. The approach is straightforward and easy to understand. We are lucky that a man like John Willingham, one of the world's great barbecue champions, is willing to share so many of his secrets. I don't think there's another book like it. A FAN FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA."
5,Nobody does it better!!,"I was a novice to barbecue when I moved to Memphis in 1986. Many cities claim to be the capital city of barbecue, but Memphis truly wears that crown.I lent the book out to my sister in Saint Louis, and let me tell you--I had to buy the darn thing over, because people will not part with this book. Is it really that good?? YES!!To put it simply--John Willingham has forgotten more about barbecue that the rest of us know!!"
5,A Big Challenge,This BBQ book is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to learn the basics of barbecuing plus techniques of champions.
5,An Unexpected Pleasure,"A true ""lesson"" for the avid Q'er.Informative and humorous with a complete potpourri of recipes. A must for us average folks who do not have tons of $ for a foot long list of ingredients. (Sorry Paul & Emeril)With this book in one hand and my ""Wham"" seasoning in the other, I'm headin' to the grill. The result is ""awesome""...guaranteed!!!"
1,"""pure hype""","I've been making memphis style bbq for a few years now, yes, even way up here in Kennebunk Maine. This book, while interesting to read, is more of an advertisement for the author's products than a guide to good bbq. His championship recipes rarely discuss wood used, critical to that smoke flavor we all love. I'd recommend you search the web for bbq info before buying this book, you'll end up making better bbq and save yourself the cost of this tribute to the author's ego."
2,Not the best barbecue book,"This is a peculiar book. It has obviously been fluffed up to justify a hardcover. It contains such unneeded recipes as ""balogna sandwich"" and ""BLT."" The barbecue/grill recipes are on the simple side (marinate in Italian dressing, then cook), but that's not necessarily bad. The author's most intruiging suggestion, not echoed in any other barbecue book I have read, is that smoke does not belong in low, slow barbecue. If he's right, and he may be, you can save a lot of time and money. Use plain old charcoal, forget the smokey hardwood. His point is that the flavors should come from the meat, the rub (or marinade), and and the mop. Now that you know his point, you do not need to buy his book until it becomes available in a() paperback. If you are a barbecue newby, better you should buy ""Smoke & Spice"" (and maybe eschew the smoke)."
4,it is what it is,clicked on amazon and this nailer wasd priced at 67.50 . i thought it was a mistake but took a chance and ordered it . when i got done with my order i looked again and it had gone up to 470.00. i will now wait for it to arrive and if i was dreaming.
4,A rough start,"A word of caution. When attaching the handle my husband screwed it down to tight and broke the handle. I then had to order a new one. The handle is not as strong as I would have hoped, We have not had a chance to use it yet, we will be laying about 1100 sq feet of flooring in another month, so I'll let you know how it goes."
5,Works as advertised.,"So far I ran about 1500 cleats through the nailer. Not a single problem. I have been using it with the pre-finished floor adapter on 3/4"" red oak. I also used the Bostitch 2"" cleats. It does not not come with the male fitting to hook to your compressor. You also need an adaptor to fit it with a 1/4 inch male fitting."
5,Does the job nicely,"Just finished installing about 3,000 sf of oak flooring. Worked perfectly with no fuss, no problems. Paid for itself. Mine came with a graphite handled hammer, which is a nice tool, with good balance."
1,Nailer Breakdown,"I was able to install 160 square feet of a 900 square foot flooring job before my nailer broke. Stanley considers this broken part ""normal wear"", and Amazon will not take back opened merchandise. Just a heads up to contractors who may worry about buying tools online- don't do it. My regular supplier would have given me a new nailer no questions asked."
4,I'm in the Wedding Too : A Complete Guide for Flower Girls &,"I bought this as part of a gift to my junior bridesmaid. It is an excellent book to help include the little girls in your wedding. It also doubles as a scrapbook for the girls. I highly recommend this book, my junior bridesmaid loved it."
4,Complete means Complete!,This book is COMPLETE! I bought this for two of my flowergirls (Age 6 & 7). It's a great guidebook and nice souvenir but it's got a bit of a serious tone - there's a lot of talk about practicing so it may freak some kids out. That said it's comprehensive and certainly gives a child who hasn't been to a wedding before a great idea of what happens.
3,Review for young granddaughter,It took about 2 hours to finish this book. I enjoyed it but didn't realize it was for a young middle-school ager. Definitely gave a good look at the life. I will use her book listings in the back to read more....
3,Forget Stamos...This movie stars Vanity,For anyone who grew up in the early 80's you know that Vanity(prince's girl) was the bomb.She stars in this silly low budget flick.I'm not really sure what the movie is about but if you are a old-school Vanity fan this is a must.Enjoy and take a trip down memory lane.Ohh...I almost forgot she is topless in one scene.
3,"Gene Simmons and John Stamos, an interesting combination","Gene Simmons in drag,trying to rule the world, John Stamos as a cop who's extremely into his job, what more could you want?"
2,Never Too Young To Die,"This movie is really not that good. It does star John Stamos, who is trying to avenge his fathers death at the hands of Gene Simmons(KISS). There is really bad writing in this low budget movie, but if you are a Kiss fan you might want to get it because Gene Simmons is in it and plays the villian. Vanity is also in the movie as well. This film is before her great perormance in ""Action Jackson"". There is a funny scene in the movie, however. Gene Simmons kisses Vanity sticking his tounge down her throat in typical Simmons fashion. Like I said, if you are a Kiss fan,you might watch it because of that reason."
3,Not very powerful,"Not very powerful at sucking the water back up, but did clean spots I wanted to get off the carpet. Would be nice if it held more water in the tank. I thought it would be nice to have to clean upholstery, but it is too large and awkward for most jobs."
1,Cheap Chinese Useless Device,"I bought this cleaner to do some light spot cleaning. I had to take the first unit back as the sprayer didn't work. The second one also had a non-functioning sprayer until I took it apart and found that the hose was pinched. I put it back together to find that the sprayer worked but simply sprayed the front of the unit. Oh well, I figured I would manually spray then use this piece of junk to do the scrubbing. Three minutes in the belt broke. Bissell was a proud company but the last couple of their products from China have been as bad as any product I've ever purchased. My personal advise is to stay as far away from Bissell as possible until they figure out that quality does matter."
1,This machine is worthless.,"I bought a Bissell Little Green about 6 years ago, and it started spewing the dirty water out the top of the tank. I chucked it and got this model instead. I was such a sucker. It only seems to pick up about 20% of the water. Then, after only about 3 uses, it has started dripping the dirty water out around the brushes. Maybe that's just because it's doing such a lousy job of picking up the water. I will NEVER buy another Bissell product again!"
4,Great for pet clean ups!,"We bought this product because we have two cats who are always making messes. It's been fabulous! It gets the stains out very well. It's light weight, and the cord is nice and long. It comes apart nicely for easy cleaning of the brushes and tanks. The only thing I was surprised at is I think it could use a little bit more suction. Not much water ends up in the tank. But we still love it!"
2,no spray... but works as a mechanical scrubber,"the spray for the solution doesn't work. i've done everything sort of returning it! with that aside, the scrubbers and suction work great... so i just spray my carpet cleaner myself and instead of scrubbing myself, i use my bissell. with that said, i wish i would have spent the extra 30$ for the little green; have heard nothing but great things from friends, and even watched them clean up messy red spills on white carpet with it!"
2,I have had better,I had a cordless Bissell Spotlifter for years and it finally died. I got this one to replace it. It does not suction well and the roller grabs too much carpet fiber. It also does not do a continueous spray for dispensing the cleaner. The retainer for the dirty water is difficult to remove also.Overall I am not well pleased and will probably look for another product to replace this as soon as possible and hope I can sell this one for a decent amount as a used item.
2,It didn't work!,"Try as we might we could never get this to spray. We went to the FAQ page and followed all the instructions. It just never worked and had to be returned. The other problems I found with it right off the bat was that it was very heavy and the solution container was very, very small. I have since bought the Dirt Devil version of this and while not perfect, it is a big improvement over this one."
2,Promises more than it can deliver,"I had great hope in the Bissell Powerbrush but find myself disappointed. First off, the unit is extremely loud. I would suggest the use of hearing protection. (no, I'm not kidding... my gasoline lawnmower is quieter.) Secondly, the suction is insufficent to pick up much liquid. If you put two or three ounces of cleaner down, you might get one ounce back. This isn't a big problem on carpet, but I do not like the results on furniture. On the plus side, the cleaner is pretty good at removing light stains on carpet, and although it is too big to wield in my car, it can clean my wife's minivan pretty nicely.In short, I wish I hadn't bought it, but not so much that I want to try to get the store to take it back."
3,Is it worth the buy?,"First of all it does Clean well. The bad thing is it doesn't hold much shampoo or sucked up water. Also kind of tricky to suck up the water left on the carpet. Need to tilt up and then apply a down ward pressure with the Powerbrush. Therefore when they say it's for cleaning a spot they really mean just that, a spot. Great for small and I do mean a small area, otherwise a chore to clean a larger area."
1,spotlifter or spot grinder?,"I bought this product thinking that it would be better than the cordless spotlifter that I had previously owned. The ""powerbrush"" just grinds in the spot and water flow required to loosen the stain must be hand pumped a little squirt or more accurately a dribble at a time. The prevoius cordless spotlifter pumped large amounts of water under pressure and made the clean up much easier.Also the suction is lousy compaired to the old cordless version. Once the spot is wet and loosened there is not sufficient suction to pick up the water.I'm sorry I bought this product. It does a very poor job."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I really appreciate the reviews here at Amazon so i want to give my 2 cents too. Be warned this thing is a piece of doo doo! Seriously you could throw down a cup of water on my carpet and scoop it up with a spoon and get better results. The water sprays out and leaks from the sides and then you are supposed to ""tilt"" the machine up to get your suction. Well I have had that bad boy vertical and there is no more suction than me breathing in a deep breath! i wish I had returned it but i didn't and all I can say is I am glad I didn't pay alot for it!"
4,I have worn out my first one and am purchasing a new one.,I have two cats that throw up hair balls a couple times a week. I have had myBissell 1716B Spotlifter Powerbrush Handheld Deep Cleanerfor three or four years. The brushes have stopped rotating. I think it is only the belt but I can't find replacement parts. It is very easy to handle and clean out after using. I wish it had better suction but if you spend some time on the spot it will get it pretty dry. It does a good job on the stain.
1,Poor Product,"We bought this product along with our new puppy. After three days we returned the Bissell. The machine was heavy and had absolutely no suction power. After three tanks of water and solution, the dirty water tank barely had any water and the carpet was soaking wet (even after holding the machine at the recommended angle and really pressing it into the carpet). I would not recommend this product."
3,So-So,"I'm not totally impressed with the Spotlifter 1716B. My main complaints:1) It is REALLY noisy, to the point that I have to use earplugs.2) The sprayer is wimpy.3) Hardly any water is sucked back up by the unit.But it does clean upholstery well, and does pretty well removing set stains on my berber carpet (and imagine it will do even better on new stains). It has a nice long cord, which comes in handy. We fill the tank with 50% nature's miricle cleaner, 50% water. It works really really well for removing pet stains and odors."
1,"Very noisy, heavy, piece of junk","I am so disappointed with this Bissell. I purchased it to replace an older model Spotlifter that was a good product, but we just wore it out. The new version is complete junk. I am returning mine today. It is very noisy, much heavier than the previous model and IT DOESN""T HAVE ANY SUCTION! Basically, you are buying a machine that squirts formula+water onto your carpet (the trigger is fairly stiff, too) and brushes it in with the rollers! It says ""tilt for suction"" which still doesn't work, but if it did that means you have three steps: squirt the formula onto the carpet, use the brushes in the regular position, then go over again with the machine tilted! I, in fact, did do this. I used nearly the whole tank of solution and in the dirty water tank was at most 1 tablespoon of water that had been suctioned! Don't waste your money."
1,Did not work out of the box,"This product did not work out of the box. The brushes spun, the suction worked fine but the unit would not and will not spray cleaner. We followed all instructions from customer service and it is not fixed. Due to the poor customer service and product I am forced to award 1 star and advise consumers to seek another brand. We have used Bissell for years (large upright cleaners) but the this product and the last upright we purchased have been junk. Sorry to see a good brand go bad."
1,Bissell Powerbrush deep cleaner,While the unit works well one can no longer purchase SOME parts should they fail. Recently a plastic gear that drives the brush belt failed rendering the brush unit useless.
1,I can't imagine anything more useless.,"I don't expect much from a handheld but this was ridiculous. A spray bottle of solution would be much easier to use and *anything* would get the solution out better.I used it to try to clean up and orange juice spill and both the juice and the solution are still there. I am going to take it back, and clean up with a damp rag. If you are thinking of buying one, you might as well spend the price on wash cloths instead."
1,Disappointing to say the least!,"Yes, it does clean well & yes the scrub brush is great BUT trying to get this apart is no easy task!! Pushing in the 2 levers to take the tank out to fill it takes lots of pushing & pushing. About the time I'm ready to give up, it suddenly opens. And if that isn't enough, trying to release the tank underneath this to get rid of the dirty water...I've only been successful one time. Now, as I filled the cleaning tank today (exactly as directed & not overfilled) the cleaning tank started to leak...just a drip or 2 at a time. There are no holes anyplace to be seen, everything is in tight...even rescrewing the lid several times & it's fine...but it's leaking...from the bottom. I've decided when I get the dirty tank full...I'll just throw the whole machine out! Talk about poorly designed...Bissell has been a great company in the past, but this sure is a loser!"
1,Don't Buy It,I bought the Bissell Spotlifter Powerbrush and had the same problems mentioned in other reviews. It is a very poorly designed product with almost no suction and poor spray. I contacted Bissell and they sent me another one that doesn't work either.
3,Bissell spot,"Machine arrived in good condition. The first thing I noticed when trying it out is that the spray does not work. I tried everything to get it to work....and no...it simply refuses to spray. Yes, I followed direction exactly. Otherwise it does do a good job (I have been using a spray bottle)"
2,No suction,The Bissell does a good job of removing the stain however I have used this several times and still have practically no dirty water in the resevoir. Leaves carpet wet. Not enough suction. Try another product.
4,Great for pet and 4-year-old son stains,"I use this unit solely for my cats' stains on carpet and my son's stains on the carpet and furniture. It works great. I spray quite a bit, let it sit, and go over it until there is no more visible liquid suction. It does work well on stains (even worked on a few old stains but not a red Kool-Aid stain left by previous tenants) and my carpet is light.It is very loud, louder than my upright vacuum, so that's why I give it four stars and not five. If Bissell can make the motor a little quieter it would be perfect.Don't expect miracles though - it's only $30!"
1,No suction,"There's hardly any suction. I applied a full tank of cleaner on the carpet (which requires a little effort one squirt at a time), but it only sucked up a few drops of it. customer service was helpful and had me return the product."
2,I don't like it :(,"No one has mentioned how cumbersome it is to keep holding. It's an awkward shape, and in order to get it to suction up the moisture, you have to keep holding it in a certain way. It really tires my arms out and I have to keep shifting hands. It did, finally, get rid of the stains (pop, cats, shoes), but it was hard to use. I also feel that it's heavy for it's size (especially when the tanks is full of water). I'm giving it to a neighbor and buying a full-size model."
4,Not as bad as all the reviews say!,"I bought this Bissell Spotlifter a few weeks ago. I chose this one because I only needed it for the occassional pet stain or baby food spill. It works great for me! I immediately put it to work and it got stains out that had been in my carpet for months! I do see how people could complain some about the suction but I think it gets most of the dirty water up fine. It took me a while to decide between this one and the more expensive ""Little Green"" and I think I made the right decision. I'm sure the other one is better, but it's also almost as expensive as an upright and this one gets the job done just fine. This is a good little cleaner for the money."
1,Don't waste your money,"This little machine has got to rank as the worst cleaning gadget I've ever owned. On the plus side, it is easy to use, lightweight, and has a nice long cord. The problem is, it doesn't work well. The suction is poor. Squeezing the trigger to spray the cleaning solution gets tiring very quickly, would probably be torture for someone with arthritis or carpel tunnel probems. It's annoyingly noisy (hey, it SOUNDS like it's working!). I've tried various cleaning solutions hoping maybe one brand would work better than the Bissell solution, but the problem is obviously the machine. I can clean spots quicker and easier and much better by hand."
1,Piece of junk,"Run, don't walk, away from this product.Basically the spot lifter just makes a bigger mess than you started with. The worst part is when it randomly explodes out the back end for no reason, spattering whatever it is you've just ""cleaned"" up all over the carpet again. I used this thing to clean up dog barf the other night, and I remembered why I hadn't used it in months. It spattered out the back end, so I took in in the bathroom to clean the machine up, which ended up being such a messy, horrible process that I had to clean the entire bathroom afterwards! I would have been better off leaving the dog barf alone. Yuck.I would also recommend wearing ear plugs if you buy this, as it's very loud."
3,ok while it lasted,"This little machine was used to clean up numerous pet accidents, to freshen up the furniture occasionally, and once to clean up the car interior. It didn't work great, but it worked for about 5yrs with intermittent use. Recently, the gears on the scrubber stripped out and the plug for the tank cracked. I will be shopping around for something else to replace it."
1,No Spray,"I bought a brand new Bissell 1716B Spot Lifter. When I unpacked it, I read all the directions, filled the reservoir with Bissell formula and water. When I tried to spray, no spray. I followed the troubleshooting on the guide, No Spray. I went to the Bissell web site and in FAQ's found a 1716 model question with No Spray and followed the recommendations - Still NO Spray. I am returning this and won't buy another Bissell product."
2,not very good,"It is inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. the suction was very weak. I tried to clean up a spill in my car and it couldn't suck up the liquid at all. I ended up buying a more expensive wet vac to clean my car. This product doesn't cost much, but it is a waste of money."
3,Does the job,"PRO: The price is reasonable. The rotating brushes make it easy to remove small spots.Con: I'd rather an automatic spray than one you must keep pressing. Also, suction could be better."
4,Worked out stains well,I just purchased this handheld tonight and tried it out - it works great! My husband tends to spill coffee on the carpet so we've had some stains that are at least a year old. They came right out with this. The only thing that is a bit of a hassle is cleaning it out. But it's worth it!
5,Great,I bought this originally to clean up after my dog and it worked great but then one day i spilled red wine on the carpet and it took the stain right out i was amazed at how easy it was. The only thing i would improve is the cord it get's in your way to much. Otherwise it is a great item.
2,Not enough suction!,"I thought, just the thing for my stairs, which are always a mess (dog, cat, me--spilling tea, coffee, who knows what.) I had high hopes because my carpet shampooer is not great on the stairs and the Bissell Spot Bot has a nice hose attachment but it's a bit heavy for me to lug up the stairs. However, this JUST didn't have the power. Not really recommended for my application, which was carpeted stairs. Maybe would be ok for a vacuumed-out car."
3,Decent but not great.,"This works decently.. However this is something you can use for any easy mess. The water spray you need to press repeatedly, does not spray constantly if button is held like similiar products. Does clean messes but if you are looking for something that you can use on a bigger mess or a hard to remove stain this is not it.Water tank is also tiny and with just a few sprays is empty. I have four kids and a dog so this does the job and gets a point for accessabilty, Although I end up using my big steamer half the time anyway. But you do get what you pay for..almost."
3,Cleaned the cat spots,"Did a fair job of cleaning the cat puke stains, eats up the cleaning fluid fairly quick. bought more at Walmant"
3,Suction is terrible,"I bought this to try and remove some ""puppy stains"" from a sofa. I knew that it wasn't intended for big areas and the fact that it was handheld was great. But, the suction was terrible. It didn't seem to suck up any of the cleaning solution. I even tried it on the bare floor because I thought it wasn't working. I was left with big wet spots on the couch, but I took the chance that this would work. I honestly have not used it since the first week that I bought it. I ended up borrowing a friend's Bissell pet spot cleaner, which worked much better."
1,Bissell Spotlifter - Save your money!,"I bought this a few months ago to take care of small pet stains and accidental spills. I ended up waiting past 30 days to first use it (so it was too late to exchange) and - surprise - the sprayer didn't work! Okay, a little bit of a pain, but not a big deal as I used a small spray bottle of water/solution to spray any stains. This worked for about 3 times and then - surprise - the brush will no longer turn to scrub the spot. So now I have to spray the spot and scrub the spot myself and have this vacuum up the remaining water, which I have to say it does rather poorly. Overall, a poorly made product and a waste of my money!"
1,Defective right out of the box!,"After many years of good use my battery operated Bissell finally would not hold a charge. It was time for a replacement and thinking this 1716b (with a power cord) would be better (more power, no charge time and continuous use) I made my purchase.To my surprise, the sprayer was BROKEN right out of the box! On the first use. I called Bissell customer service and they asked me for the serial number. According to Bissell the units serial indicated it was over a year old. I guess Amazon is selling OLD stock? Anyhow Bissell has agreed to replace the unit at their expense.One last thought, The battery operated unit has an electric pump for the spray which is nice, however this unit requires you to pump the spray like a Windex bottle. Hey Bissell why the down grade on this spotlifter?PRODUCT - 1 STARBISSELL CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4 STARS"
2,Disappointed,"We bought this after inheriting an outside dog that had to learn to become an inside dog. We had been using SpotShot which is a great product, but we were using a lot of it and it didn't seem very economical. When we got this we were very excited it did a fantastic job; it had great suction, cleaned stains that a professional couldn't get up (I do suppose that could be the cleaning solution that came with it though)and was exactly what we wanted. After a few uses, however it made a terrible noise and the gears in the rotating brush wore off, we returned it for another one I really figured that it was a rare occurrence (I should have done more research). The new one just made the same terrible noise and it is going back to the store tomorrow. If we replace it it will be with another product."
2,Not impressed,"I liked that it had a constant power supply versus a cordless, but am not impressed with how weak the suction is. It takes a great deal of effort to get up any of the ""dirty water"". Leaves the carpet wet, even if you don't spray a lot of the solution. It is also heavy and noisy."
1,Very Diappointed,"I thought I could trust the name Bissell. Don't waste your time. This machine has no power and left the carpet very wet. I had to try to get it dry with a towel-which left a larger spot than I started with. I was sure I did it wrong so got another family member to try it a couple of days later. She tried for awhile and then said - this is a piece of junk! I hope you didn't give much for it. I returned it. My daughter called me today to tell me she had bought one, and that she was so disappointed. I said I know. I had one and had to return it. She said, so it isn't me. No dear. Bissell should have not wasted their time on making this model.Disappointed in TN"
3,Good but...,"I got this for Christmas and I was eagerly waiting to use it. Finally the day came. My standard poodle uncerimoniously barfed on the carpet.Pros:Solid machineGreat suctionGood rotary brushCons:Sprayer didn't work after 5 mins of laborious pumping, WTF?Brush got gunky (but at least you can take it out and clean it)Sometimes I felt like I was sprading the barf around the carpet...but I may be a hypochondriac.Instead of my Bissell sprayer I used a bottle of pet-mess cleaner. It sucked up the dirty solution very well from my deep wool carpet.Were it but for the sprayer not working, this machine would get close to 5 stars."
3,"Its okay, not great, not terrible","I have owned this for a couple of years. With three cats in house, the opportunities for cleaning up hairball aftermath abound.Pros:1. The unit is lightweight and easy to manage2. Spots will lift if they are recent3. Suction is adequate to substantially remove the cleaning liquid from the carpet or upholstery4. Cord length is adequate for the average size roomCons:1. Not adequate to remove older or dried stains2. Heated water would be more effective3. Disassembly for cleaning is a little cumbersomeOverall, this unit is better than nothing. However, I would recommend looking for a unit that heats the water internally. I have found that function adds cleaning power to the larger upright cleaning units."
1,A waste of time and money,Bought this device when our cat was sick and we had lots of clean up to do. This was no help at all because it didn't work. First of all the sprayer for the solution didn't work at all. We were desperate so we sprayed the area with a hand sprayer and tried to clean it with this machine. It was a total waste and we returned it the next day. Replaced it with Bissell's Little Green spot cleaner (see my review). It cost twice as much but saved my sanity and my kitty's life.
3,OK but not impressed,"I bought this after my Little Green died and I was hoping it would be as good or better than the Little Green on the sofa and chairs for accidents and spills, but it wasn't.It did get the stain out but what you spray and what you suck back up is so minute that you wonder if it is really clean.I am getting rid of mine to get another Little Green b/c I can spray and suck up what I spray and see that it is up and clean and getting the dirt and stains out.Yes this is an OK product for little things or carpets but not what I need it for. I have used mine maybe 3 times in a yr.The Spotlifter is super easy to clean out and take apart and put back together and the scrub brushes are strong which is good and it is light and easy to tote around but the suction doesn't suck good at all and in these types of products sucking is what ya want and need"
1,Don't waste your money,"I've had this products for a little over a year, and never have been able to get it to work properly. The spray mechanism is worthless, and we right off the bat wound up having to use a separate spray bottle. At the start, the suction portion (and yes, contrary to other reviewers' suggestions, we did have it correctly positioned for the job) would only pull back up less than a quarter of the solution put down. After a while it stopped suctioning anything up at all. The suction port quickly clogged with debris, and is impossible to clean, because the clear plastic shield is not removable. The rotating brushes aren't too difficult to remove, clean and replace ... but that is about the only plus to the thing.The machine is not worth the money spent, I'm sorry to say. Another life lesson learned."
1,i should have read the reviews first,"this machine offers nothing that a little elbow grease wouldn't accomplish. sprays out some solution and scrubs it in. the suction was so weak it left our carpets soaking wet. if i wanted that, i wouldn't have bothered buying a machine. will look into inexpensive wet-vacs instead. too bad."
1,Sprayer doesn't work out of the box!,"This machine is terrible, the first time I went to use it the sprayer doesn't work! It also has poor suction, I returned it and will not buy another one of this type. I think you get what you pay for!"
2,It's OK for the floor mats in your car - but not much else,"The biggest problem I have with my Spotlifter portable cleaner is it leaves the carpet very damp after you've attempted to clean a stain. It's good enough for cleaning the floor mats in the car, but it's practically worthless for cleaning shag / house carpets. The hand vacuum doesn't have much suction power, and hence the reason for using it primarily on car floor mats. You'd do better by simply purchasing a spray can of Woolite carpet cleaner, and use the Spotlifter only to work the soap into the stain, as that's about all the use the Spotlifter is good for. The bottom line - don't expect the results of an upright in handheld carpet cleaner."
3,It Does The Job,"The only problem I have is the suction. It picks up but not what I expect. Don't get me wrong, it does pick most up. Maybe it is the visual size proportion of the two tanks. It cleans great. I love the brush action. So, as long as it cleans I am satisfied."
4,LOUD,"It works well. I bought it for pet issues, and it takes care of fresh and not so fresh spots. Pulling off the reservoir is somewhat difficult. The receptacle rinses easily, but you can't leave on the reservoir to rinse. It all has to come off. The cord is plenty long enough with a GFI on it which is nice. The only problem is that it is so loud I have to wear earplugs when I use it. It is like a jet taking off at the end of my arm."
5,It works wonders!,"I purchased this machine with the faint hope that it would actually get the pet stains out of our carpet - but am a true believer now. I love this machine, it gets the stains out beautifully. Well worth the price."
3,Works O.K.,"The stains in my rug have been there since we moved in, which was when I was about 10 years old. It didn't really seem to do anything to the stains... although when I looked in the dispenser and the brush part, there was a lot of black stain gunk. So it picks up just a little of the stain, but it isn't very satisfying. I still like to use it though, because it makes my carpet feel cleaner knowing that it's being washed in some form, hah.Don't expect this product to work miracles. =)"
3,It's OK,"I did not like how the trigger was not electric, it is a pump trigger. Other than that is was OK."
2,The negative reviews were right on...,"It has terrible suction...it is loud and it doesn't clean very well, and I was just trying to use it to take little yogurt stains off the rug. I bought the Little green machine and that works great for spot treating and stairs."
1,A waste of money!!,"There is a big opportunity for a manufacturer to provide a product to clean carpet spills....well. I had a Hoover Steam Vac Jr. and it was pretty good, but the hose just fell apart (cheap plastic). This product is a waste. Read the other reviews, it is correct that it has NO vacuum, and the spray part is like a hand pump...you have to pump it out with the trigger...unlike the Hoover which sprayed it out using the vacuum pressure. You can pump out a cup of hot liquid, and you will get back about a quarter of a cup. Then, I use my shop vac to get almost the last three quarters that this junk will leave in the carpet. At the moment, my spot clean method is a pyrex cup of hot water and cleanser, with a stiff dish brush to clean...and the wet/dry shop vac to suck up. Not very convenient!!"
1,very bad idea!,I am a car seat technician and I am here to say... DON'T use this product or any like it! The strap covers can be a danger in an accident and if the car seat didn't come with them then you are not supposed to use it. There is no way to know what these would do to the straps in a collision. To use products like these is to risk your child's life.
5,Love 'em!,At first I was a little skeptical because these were so inexpensive but we LOVE these strap covers. They really do help keep my sons head from flopping forward while riding in the car and his little neck from getting scratched or irritated from the straps. I highly recommend these to any new parents and they will always be given by me to friends as baby gifts.
2,What was I thinking?,"Got a great deal so ordered. I didn't realize that the trimming wand and the handle that you use to manuever the vaccuum were one and the same. Kind of grossed me out. Also, it doesn't slide back together easily once you try to use the trimming wand. The hose has to be completely stretched out to replace the cleaning pipe. I bought it for that feature (easy access for attatchments). It also is very heavy. And last but not least, the inside filter clogged about the third time I used it. This caused the suction to completely stop on the attatchments. It took me a while to figure out why it wouldn't pick up any more. I'll stick with my old vac."
1,"Great for relocating the dirt, but doesn't pick it up","I hate to be really negative, so let me begin with the positives for this vacuum. First, the headlight is really bright, it shows you all the dirt left behind after you go over and over the same spot. The on-board tools and built-in hose were the reason I bought this machine. It's very convenient to have everything right there, but there's very little suction at the end of the hose, so you don't really accomplish much with them.The major defect with this machine is that the intact passage, the tunnel the dirt travels through to get to the collection cannister, is too small. It clogs up almost immediately, reducing suction to near nothing. Every time I use this machine I spend 10 minutes pulling dust bunnies and balls of dog hair out of the intake tunnel.I'm back to using my 15 year old Hoover that I paid $70 for and have used to death, it still does a great job on floors and carpets, I'll just live with the disposable collection bags."
4,True Mid West Rap,"This has to be one of the tightest mid west albums to drop since twista's adrenaline rush, even though it's new, it's still has to be the best. Those who don't know about Tech N9ne yet, peep game and get this album along with ""Worst"". Get this ish quick. Peace"
5,PUre fiRE,"Damn this CD is probably one of the best CD's ever. I'm not exaggerating at all here folks, this one is just so amazing at some points. I've been listening to hardcore/gangsta rap for so many years, and I know all the fast rappers, e.g. Twista, Three 6, Bone, etc etc I won't even mention Busta and all those other biters but basically.. Tech N9ne has almost all of them beat. Why? Becuz his tongue not only spits fire, but the kind of lyrics that you can feel. Dark, crazy stuff that you will have in your head for weeks. You just have to get this CD, even if it's just for a few tracks, namely ""Questions"" or ""Clueless"".. damn just get this one."
4,hott,even though i just got this cd im gonna rite my thoughts on it .if u people love underground rap then this is music for you.this cd has at least 5 hott songs.please support tech n9ne so he can make more phat records
4,Tight!,"This album is tight. You can't help but to like his fast paced flow. The only thing that stops this from being 5stars is the beats. They could be a little less..well...monotanous. Otherwise this is tight. Don't sleep.Also check for his next album ""WORST"", droppin' real soon."
5,This Cd is the Best You Have To Buy It,"Tech Ni9e is a very talented rapper he is from my home town Kansas City Mo he is the tightest rapper or one of them you also should look for the upcoming stars from Kansas City like Sole,Mr Stinky,57st Rouge DOG Villans ,Young Z from the TPG, and Mr Manson"
5,Great CD,"Tech N9ne is hands down the most talented hip hop artist out there. His voice is exceptional, the lyrical content of his songs is exceptional, and most of all, his flow is beyond belief. Tech is very articulate as he rhymes telling it how it is. It is probably best classified as underground (semi) gangster rap. Even his album covers contain very deep meanings that he explains in the Tech N9ne DVD released with his latest album Absolute Power. But this album is by far the best, and this is coming from an experienced hip hop listener. I hope you enjoy Tech as much as I do"
3,Tung twista maniac,TechN9ne has a style nobody can really match except for twista or young droop and he really shows this on Planet rock 2k down south mix. Another song that really stands out is Now it's on featuring lejo.The thing I didn't like about the cd is the beats their not original and they dont match together with the lyrics. Techn9ne has to many appearances on the album as well. I think he should mostly stick with himself.
4,Double foam squeegee,I've purchased this product through an auto parts store in the past.With regular use this squeegee lasted over 5 years.So thats why I'm buying it again. I'd say its well worth $ spent.
4,Lovely design,"The bracelet looks fabulous, and feels quite more substantial than one would expect from the picture. One drawback, however, is that it is pretty short, and unless one has very slender wrists, it won't fit. The quality is excellent though, and I love the way it looks."
2,Great when it works,"Bought this screw gun to screw down subflooring on a house addition. Thought it would make a multiple day job on my knees , a one day job standing up. When it worked, the screw gun was great. Drove most screws flush. But it would soon start to strip screws and not drive them all the way in. I figured out that the bits were getting worn fast. As soon at the bit became worn, it wouldn't drive the screws all the way. Each box of screws comes with 2 bits, but that's not enough to even drive half a box - and the bits are small (special) not the standard 1/4 inch hex bits and hard to change out. I would recommend buying a couple of packs of bits for each box of screws you buy. I've got a drywall job coming up and I'll give it another chance, but right now I really wish I hadn't purchased this tool."
5,"1999, but has a great selection of tunes","ZZ Top - you know them by sight...at least Frank Hill and Billy Gibbons, with their chest-length beards! But, you also know them by their sound - Sharp Dressed Man, Legs, Tush, et cetera and et cetera!Now, this Greatest Hits album came out in 1992, so it doesn't have some of their later tunes. But, it nonetheless has a great selection of tunes, including My Head's In Mississippi, Planet of Women and Viva Las Vegas. It's a great album, and if you like ZZ Top at all then you will really like this album!"
5,"ZZ Top's ""Greatest Hits"" CD = 18 ZZ Top Classics!!!!","Outstanding from beginning to end period!!!! It contains all their classics such as: ""Gimme all Your Lovin'"", ""Sharp Dressed Man"", ""Tush"", ""My Heads in Mississippi"", ""Chaep Sunglasses"", ""LaGrange"", ""Legs"", and many more. This is an outstanding cd that should be included in any ""rock music"" collection. Thanks!!!!"
4,Takes you back,What can you say about ZZ Top that hasn't already been said. It's a CD that will bring you back in time.
5,ONE OF THE BEST ROCK GROUPS EVER.,"Wow!! What a great compilation. I just can't get enough of ZZ Top. These guys really rock as I can play them over n over and over again. I think that song Gimme All Your Lovin is one of the greatest songs in rock history, ever!! GREAT MUSIC..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL ROCK FANS WITH A GREAT TASTE IN MUSIC. GET THIS WITH ALBUMS FROM METALLICA."
3,never heard it yet,"I bought this CD before I went back to Georgia, and I have notlistened to it yet! A friend of mine wanted me to listen to thisthe day before I went traveling. There are a few greates so farand these guys were good. I may litsen to this when I come backand listen to it in the car."
1,Honestly I Just Dont Like ZZ Top,"ZZ Top you hate em or you love em. I dont hate these guys but i just honestly dont like really any of the songs on this album except three, Sharp Dressed Man, LA Garange, and Tush. Every other song on here i really hate ecsepcially, ""Planet Of Woman"", or ""Legs"". ZZ Top all they do is sing about hot women and getting some. Thats there whole basis for there band thats it every song thats what they sing about. Arrggg whats next Journey, ""Be Good To Yourself"", come on people pick up Dark Side Of The Moon instead of this shameless music"
5,Won't catch many ZZZZs listening to this,This is an excellent overview of ZZ Top's music. It's got all the hits you'll remember from the radio. This is the ultimate hillbilly rock album. Snazzy guitars make their presence known throughout. This disc has 18 songs and 1 hour and 12 mintues of music. Great value. This is a must-have for any Top fan.
3,ZZ TOP LEGENDS,"A GOOD COMPILATION OF HITZ BUY THE GUYZ,I HOPE THEY CAN KEEP ON ROCKIN AND BRING OUT SOME MORE ALBUMZ TO PUT IN MY COLECTION THANKZ GUYZ"
3,***1/2 - pretty good,"Well, the music is better than ""pretty good"". ZZ Top's tough blues n' boogie is here a-plenty, but there are a few minor songs here, too many MTV-era pop-rock numbers and not enough of their gritty 70s material for my taste.I know, it's called ""Greatest Hits"", so if you only want the hits, I suppose it's all fine and good. But I'd go for the new double-disc anthology ""Rancho Texicano"" instead if I was looking for my first ZZ Top purchase...that one paints a much more complete picture of the little ol' band from Texas."
3,"Great songs, bad remix","This is an excellent collection of ZZ Top hits. Some of the classics, particularly ""La Grange"", have been re-mixed with WAY too much reverb. In my opinion, this ruins a classic sound, which was very tight and done right the first time around.For the real mix, buy ""The Best of ZZ Top"". This older hits collection has many other ZZ Top hits that are missing from ""Greatest Hits"", including ""Waitin' for the Bus"", ""Jesus just left Chicago"", ""Just got Paid"", ""Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers"", and ""Heard it on the X""."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THEIR PREVIOUS GREATEST HITS COLLECTION,"While this greatest hits collection is a good barometer for their post Deguello radio friendly hits, it does not capture the raw power and emotion of their earlier output that was deeply rooted in pure Texas blues and boogie....So if you are a casual Top fan and enjoy such songs as Legs and Sharp Dressed Man you will enjoy this, but if you are interested in hearing what these Tres Hombres from Houston, Tejas sounded like before they acheived commercial success, check out the greatest hits collection that was released in 1977...you will not be dissapointed"
2,"Eh, selection okay, sound sucks","I'm not sure what went wrong but the sound quality on this CD is like listening to it through a pillow. It's not every song but most of them sound that way. When these songs came out and when some were used on ""Married, With Children,"" the sound was clearer, definitely not muffled like most of this CD sounds. Definitely not remastered. ZZ Top is a great band but if I had it to do over, I'd wait for a remastered version or another collection of the band's greatest hits. Buy this used. It's not worth full freight."
5,Greatest Hits ZZ Top CD,I love ZZ Top. The CD arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. This CD contains some of my favorite ZZ Top numbers.
4,ZZ Rocks,"I hadn't really paid much attention to ZZ Top, until I saw them at the Oregon State Fair this year. They were really good and funny, and I was amazed at how many of their songs I had been listening to over the years. I wanted a CD with those songs on it, and this ""best of"" is the one I picked. I'm not sorry I did. The only problem: my husband says the neighbors can hear me coming, because my radio's on so loud."
3,2 BIG Omissions,"Where are the 2 charted hits ""Stages"" and ""Velcro Fly?"" Both off the album, Afterburner, it seems odd that they're not included, especially when several soundtrack cuts and lesser-known, less successful tracks ARE included. Shame on you boys."
4,"A by-the-numbers ""best of"" album","This album contains all the ZZ Top material most casual fans will ever need to hear. Concentrating as it does on their 1979-1986 heyday, it includes just about everything you'll ever hear on the radio (or on MTV) from the Little Ol' Band from Texas. In fact, only two fairly horrible new songs, ""Gun Love"" and a miserable by-rote cover of ""Viva Las Vegas"" keep the album from being a perfect anthology. This is a good place to start your ZZ Top collection."
4,A near perfect CD,"This is a great collection of ZZ Top songs. However, this CD misses 5 stars due to the omission of five songs: Waiting On The Bus, Jesus Just Left Chicago, Thank You, TV Dinners and Stages. Otherwise, great stuff."
4,The Best of a great Texas Blues Band,"ZZ Top is a classic American blues band. Billy Gibbons is a master of blues guitar.Over the last 30 years or so they have come out with some of the finest blues you will ever hear.Gimme All Your Lovin, Sharp Dressed Man, Tush, Sleeping Bag. Le Grange, Legs among others have made ZZ Top of of the finest bands in America.This is a collection of song from their entire career.If you have not heard ZZ Top or if you just want their hit songs, this CD is for you. Enjoy..........."
5,Informative for anyone interested in monastic life,"The author, a Trappist monk, is know to friends of mine. The book is very reader friendly and also quite informative. The author describes the spiritual life of monastics in general with emphasis on the Trappist life. While this book does not specifically address how a lay person might use these spiritual practices, it is clear that one could begin to incorporate them into their daily life. This book could be useful for any person interested in deepening their relationship with God.Chapters include silence, work, prayer, and the other components of monastic life. Clear, understandable rational for the benefits of the specific practices are given. A minor drawback is a lack of reference to the Rule of Benedict or Holy Scripture for the practice. However, the readability of the book makes up for this."
4,Good wicking and absorption,I really like this product. It adds a good amount of absorption to any incontinent product. I would recommend the brief or underwear have standing leak guards for best use of this product.
1,VERY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,GO WITH THE TRANQUILITY SUPER PLUS EXTRA LONG BOOSTER THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE BEST!PLUS IF..YOU DONT LIKE THESE..AFTER YOU TRIED JUST ONE..YOU CAN NOT GET REFUND..NOT SO WITH THE TRANQUILITY..THESE FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A LOAD IN YOUR PANTS. HORRIBLEDO NOT RECCOMEND!COMPANY NOT PLESANT TO WORK WITH EITHER VERY UNHAPPY. I WAS A FOOL TO TRY AND LEAVE MY TRANQUILITY...NEVER AGAIN!UPDATE:Tena came out with these new pads but if you get the 11 plus they are bigger and better then both og the above and they are hour glass shaped...now THEY are my new booster liners that I will never stop using even better then tranquility..def do not buy the ones on this page i promise...you WILL be unhappy! they are just straight narrow and thick very uncomfortable thick!
1,Unrealistic and boring,"Thought I'd try a new author of medical thrillers. Was I ever disappointed. First off, this author seems to know next tonothing about the reality of hospitals and the role of nurses.A DOCTOR administering a Demerol shot in a hospital???? PLEASE. Where does this guy get his inaccurate information? Also, a nurse would NEVER leave pills with a patient -- it is his/her job to administer them personally so that it can be documented on the chart -- a legal record.I hate it when authors get small facts wrong, tells me they are lazy and makes the book totally flop for me.As for the plot.....well, there's another problem.Don't waste your money on this one."
4,Concise view of the decline,"I am not a historian, just an interested person. This book is a good concise view of the decline of Rome, however it is not a page turner. It is heavy on archeological findings and light on connecting the dots. The author goes to pains to not push his ideas too hard."
3,The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization,"The research and facts are good. The chronological storytelling could be better and is not up to the challenge of the many facts involved. It makes reading more difficult. The analysis of the economic, political and financial background (cause effect) for the fall of the emprire and defense and administrative systems are also short on depth.Geographical locations and city names of the time need to be compared to the actual names more frequently to improve orientation.Facts, names and other historic elements are good and very informative. Anecdotes and life stories of the time are also very good and give a good impression of the issues at hand for those living in that era.Overall positive.I would recommend it taking into account the above.Randal C.F. Croes"
3,Probably not the Best Book on This Topic to Start With,"First let me disclose that I know very little about this topic; that's why I picked up the book. If, like me, you are looking for a good introduction to the topic, this is not the best book to start with. The author is writing for an informed audience.That said, I did learn a lot by reading it. I was amazed to learn how much archeologist can determine with little more than old pottery, coins and graffitti. I was surprised to learn that the empire was far more complex and fragmented than I had previously believed. I also got a good picture of how little we know about the Roman Empire, how many questions there still are, and how much debate continues. It seems the question, ""Did Rome FALL?"" is still unanswered.Ultimately, I learned that ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" has become one of the great myths of the modern era. We interpret and teach it in the way that best reinforces our own values."
4,A Scholarly Analysis of the Fall of Rome,"Did Rome really fall? Did it matter? Was the fall of Rome just the loss of a collapsing city that left life much the same under the new barbarian overlords? These and others are the questions that Bryan Ward-Perkins asks in this book. This book is not a narrative of the events surrounding Rome's fall, but an argument that it truly did constitute an event of great magnitude. It is a struggle to read at times but it contains much useful information that cannot be found elsewhere."
5,Top to down reference for cache design,"The book deals with different kinds of cache design, real world cache problems and interesting cache tricks. good to have as an on shelf reference for a practicing design engineer."
2,I find it rather basic and for the beginner only:,"I would recoommend this book for beginners, I also would say that black belts in Karate might find this a good book. However as a jujitsu practioner for 41 years I would have to poass on this book."
2,DOES NOT STAND UP TO MODERN VIEWING,"Over acting by everyone with hackneyed plot. But interesting to see the drab 1950 New Zealand scene. Six a'clock closing in the pubs. Dancing in the village hall , small town horse racing etc."
2,Defective Disc,"Great concert, even though it's similar to their last production, it's still worth it. The first DVD (Glasgow concert) must have been of poor quality as it froze up, skipped, froze up, skipped, etc, for the duration of the entire video. The second disc worked fine. I have a new DVD player and haven't experienced this with any other disc, and I've played plenty. I'm lazy and probably won't go through the time and process of returning it (especially after I assumed it would work and threw out the receipt and pacakging), but was disappointed in a defective disc being shipped to me. For New Order fans, as long as it works, def worth picking up."
3,Not as pleased as most...,I have had this vacuum since it debuted last Christmas. Over the first few months it work as good as could be expected for a broom vac. Now after a year I find it doesnt hold charge well...and the vacuum barley works. I still use it for small things but it can no longer keep up with my 18X20 kitchen. I was thinking of purchasing the bissell flip it but the reviews seem to make me look in another direction. Hope this review will save you some money
4,Handy little Vac,Very light and portable. Good price. I used it for the first time and it picked up rather well. The little can that holds larger particles does fill up quickly. Of course I am using it to pick up cat litter. But it beats sweeping with a broom which takes much longer and I still can't get every little particle whereas this does.
3,"Noisy, yet effective.","Pros:Cleans well and into corners.Holds it's charge long enough to finish cleaning.Does a better job than any other of the same sort that we have tried.The cordless factor allows a lot more freedom in cleaning quickly.Cons:Too noisy (might as well be running a vacuum cleaner ... wakes our daughter, and makes her cry if she hears it).Debris capture area is too small.Filter needs to be cleaned ... and has to be completely dry before running again.Overall:This is great if noise is not an issue (no napping infants, or any animal or human with sensitive hearing). It is also great if you aren't trying to clean a whole house with it (we have a lot of bare floors).I'm ordering a commercial rated Rubbermaid mechanical sweeper (non-electric) to replace it due to the noise, filter and debris capture size issues. Otherwise, my mother now uses it and loves it (except having to wait for the filter to dry)."
5,Everyone Must Have One,If you are like me and thought that the Swiffer was the greatest thing invented. You will be adding the Bissell Catch-All to that list. This thing is great is picks up everything.
2,What a piece of #!$#@$!!!,"Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this Bissell piece of garbage. Bought a year ago and just threw out!!! Hardly used because battery would last maybe 10-minutes. Canister to hold garbage way too small and the damn thing keeps turning off whe trying to vacuum under sofa's or bed.Save your money and get a broom, works better."
1,Don't buy it.,I bought it for $19.99 and it is a dog... battery management requires only charging for 8 hours and constantly having the battery in the charger and charging too long... or it's in the device and dead... designer expects you to vacuum for 15 minutes every 8 hours !!! Dust collector is too small for normal use... changing pads is weird... have to take off pad to recharge the battery. Nice idea... very flawed design.
4,Great for laminate wood flooring!,"I have a new home and my entire downstairs is laminate wood. I have three cats and a toddler, so needless to say, I have a ton of sweeping and cleaning to do on a daily basis. The Catch All has done a grea job on crumbs, dirt and cat hair. I just love it! The way the duster hooks on is great, it stays put and the vac works well too. Real sucking power. My only slight complaint is getting crumbs out of corners is challenging. If can be done, but with a bit more effor than is needed on the rest of the floor. Overall, this product is a winner!"
1,Poor quality,"I bought this as I read in these reviews that it would be good for hardwood floors. Within the first week of using it on brand new hardwood floors and tile, it left behind scratches. It is now in my closet. I don't recommend this for hardwood floors."
1,Very poor,"It has almost no suction power, I get more for my money with a wet rag than this item. Also battery charge tends to get quite warm when charging battery. Probably wouldn't want to leave this charging while you are away. Do yourself a favor get a swiffer instead."
2,No difference between this and the dustbuster on a stick....,"None. Actually may be a bit worse. Doesn't really cut it for kitchen sweep up with small children. Just doesn't pick much up over the size of dust. Probably would be great if you're just getting pet hair or daily dust, but if you have children under five, then this won't cut it. The catch tray is also too small, even for much pet hair probably. And, the on switch is on top of the unit, so if you're trying to get under kitchen cabinet overhangs, it turns itself off. AND, the battery charging thing is a pain - the other kind has a plug in to the unit as opposed to a charging unit (those always seem to disappear at my house).Oh well. Move this one upstairs for dust and finally cave in for a real one. Drat. I really liked the cordless concept."
4,A Great Primer,"Understanding the Scriptures is a very easy to read primer on the seven Sacraments of the Church as in the Church today. Mr. Stravinskas explains each sacrament well, without going into unnecessary detail that would lose the average reader. In the first chapter the author explains what a sacrament is; then he devotes a chapter to each sacrament. One of the most interesting parts of the book is the epilogue in which the author speaks out on his opinions on the state of the sacraments in the Church today!This is a book you will enjoy reading, it's not a boring discourse and it's easy enough for young adults to read. This book is solidly orthodox Catholicism without any special interest spin found so often in Catholic books these days."
4,To the reader from the Uss Independence:,"i enjoyed the book very much and i'd like to speak with you, i to would like to be a Seal, and id like to hear about your experiences. please email me."
4,"Very good, but not enough!","To be honest, I am a little disappointed. I expected more details about different types of equipment used in different missions. But I might have felt this way, because I couldn't get enough of that stuff! All in all, the book is fun to read. It is written very well and contains many very good pictures."
5,Condiments on Ice,"This is an excellent product to use when entertaining. All your condiments remain fresh and cold for several hours. It's really handy to fill the separate, removable sections and refrigerate until ready for use. I highly recommend this quality item! The first time I used mine it got great reviews from guests."
2,"Great hardware, Poor software","This mouse seems very durable and has good ergonomics. The wheel button has a little too much resistance, but maybe it'll loosen up after a while. The tracking is great. Hardware-wise, this mouse gets 5 stars.The software (called ""Office Program Selector"") is poor. You can't customize what any of the buttons do. The side buttons are for the back and forward functions in your browser. I would like to be able to assign them to other functions (which you could do with Microsoft mouse devices 5 years ago), but the software won't let me.The middle button opens up a menu that allows you to launch eight programs (Word, Excel, IE, Outlook, etc.) with one click. The problem is, you can't customize the programs that are listed. So, the software gets 1/5 stars, and is now uninstalled on my machine.Hopefully, Iogear will release a new version of their software that fixes these problems. Until then, this mouse gets a thumbs down."
1,Average performance,Installation was very easy. But I had later troubles with this unit. But after reinstalling the driver it was ok. Performace is average.
1,Very Uncomfortable,I bought 2 and one worked for about 2 months before needing replacement. Its the most uncomfortable mouse Iv'e ever used I wish the other one would break too. I have big hands and this mouse still needs to be smaller. I feel like i have to strech my fingers to click and then it hurts my palm. I found a mouse that is much more comfortable and easy to use here is the linkMicrosoft Intellimouse Optical Mouse
2,"Good mouse, short life","I really liked my Iogear mouse while it was alive. However, in less than a year, it stopped working, and I replaced it with a MS wireless mouse. I really didn't care for the hypersensitivity, but I did like the quick launch feature on this mouse. No matter what, though, I'll take reliability over gadgets every time."
2,The mouse is tough to control,True to its name it has high sensitivity. Too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live.Start moving in all directions.On my couch the mouse is dead.If the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive.But when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck. The paws/foot of the mouse is sticky.Not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse....I am returning this product.Even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen.
2,Don't believe the Hype,"[...]The mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse. I have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse. This is NOT it. Unfortunately with this one, the sensor doesn't stand still. My screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there, the arrow jumps in all directions about 2-3 arrow spaces around. Don't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse. My old optical was better."
2,A once-a-year tool,"Use the masonry blade if you've got one 4x4 tile to cut or trim. Use the grinding/metal cutting blade if you've got paper thin metal to cut or trim. Otherwise it's a trip back to the hardware store for either a replacement or something much more robust. My first one ended with the arbor lock breaking and the blade permenantly affixed. Also, the gear mechanism is so cheesy it stripped out and now there's no torque on the blade. I went back for a second zip mate (maybe the first was just a dud?) and the second has done the same as the first (stripped out gears). But don't think I was out cutting brick or concrete with this thing. It was all light duty work. When cutting masonry the blade makes its way through the material on its own. You don't force it. But this item can't even keep pace with what it was designed to do. If I find something more sturdy I'll let you know."
2,Frustrated?,"This attachment is not worth the plastic it's made out of. I'm ready to throw mine away. There's no efficient way of removing the arbor to change out cutting wheels if the arbor is on too tight. The gear system is not adequate to take the elbow grease required to break the tight seal and you can't get vise grips on it, without damage, to hold it. Good luck!"
2,"Nice accessory, but with an alignment problem","I purchased the Rotozip tool a year ago, and love it. I then purchased the Zip Mate attachment, and have been disappointed with it ever since. It does a nice job of cutting, and such, but the problem is with the alignment procedure for the pinion gear. If you install the gear into the Rotozip, and don't get it down far enough, it will rub an axel inside the Zip Mate, and destroy your attachment. The tip of the pinion gear axel will also round over, not allowing you to remove the Zip Mate attachment without taking the unit apart. I wish there was some way to see how far up the gear is setting so that you could re-ajust if needed. Other then that, I love my Rotozip tool"
5,"Quick shipping, great price!","I love amazon because I can find everything in one place that I need! And, with Prime, it makes it so worth it to not have to go to so many stores to find these random products (that I usually forget I need when I'm at the store anyhow)!This filter was a perfect fit, perfect price and got to me very quickly! Thanks!"
1,Not a Bissell - DO NOT BUY,"What was sent to me is not a Bissell brand filter. Does not fit my Bissell vacuum, it is too small. It says it fits Claenview and power Force vacuums. It is made by More Quality Less Money. Generic filter, DO NOT BUY. I read other reviews that said the same thing; I should have listened to them. It's difficult to return since it is not sold from Amazon. I will be sending it back anyways."
4,Made to Brissell specs,These style 7 hepa filters are made to the Brissell design specs. You should replace this filter once a year to maintain clean air from your vacuum.
1,HEPA is just HYPE!!,"i think this is just another marketing ploy to make you pay more for an item. it says replace filter every 3 months - you will get an indicator light letting you know when to replace, and you will clearly see so on a filter - it will be dirty. WELL, neither happened yet, and its 9 months into heavy use on 2 different HEPA vaccuum cleaners. i bought extras in advance thinking ill need them, but SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
3,Shorter than the original Bissell filter,"As others have noted, this filter fits, but is slightly shorter (~1/8"") shorter than the original Bissell filter. Either update the product or note that in the description. It seems this will affect it's effectiveness and compromise its ""HEPA"" characteristics."
5,"Perfect fit, works great.",Bought this to replace my original factory HEPA Filter on my Bissell vacuum. Fits perfectly and works just like the original. Will buy again when the time comes around to replace it.
5,It is a great price compared local,"I bought this and was happy with the price, the time to ship, and the quality of the product. I saved 50% of what it would have cost me at the local wal mart."
5,Bissell No 7 Filter,"My upright vac was beginning to blow some foul odors. When I removed the old filter it was dirty and brown. Time to replace the post-motor HEPA filter.The new Filter arrived in good condition and was a genuine Bissell. The filter is sturdy and should last a while.Before replacing the HEPA filter, I cleaned the air outlet with a sanitizing wipe. A quick change and the vac is as good as new.Be sure to clean the other two ""sponge type"" filters (if your vac has them) for peak performance."
1,Incorrect Fit for Style 7,"Purchased the filter from Amazon.com (vs. the Fulfilled by Amazon vendors), and still did not receive a genuine Bissell product -- a generic version. Also had the same issue as a previous reviewer of the filter being about 1mm to 2mm too small (thus defeating the point of being an air filter). I ended up folding up a piece of flat cardboard to fill in the space -- seems to work OK, but not ideal of course.In short, poor manufacturing quality on this generic version of the Style 7 Bissell filter."
1,NJite,The filter received was not a genuine Bissell type 7 filter. It was a generic made by Crucial Vacuum. There is a small 1/8 inch gap on the top. This defeats the purpose of a HEPA filter as most of the air bypasses the filter.
2,Not Bissell Brand,"Recieved the filter in a generic brand bag. False advertising for the product. Haven't check the fit yet, but I'm hoping I don't have big gaps like some other people. Don't buy this if you want the actual Bissell Brand."
5,replacement filter,Again this fit my vacuum perfect and the vacuum is running better than ever. Would order from here again.
3,Bissell Filter #7,"Sent without packaging, but looks like the real thing. Works fine and best price around."
4,"Amazing on carpet, amazingly bad on bare floors","After much on-line research, I purchased this machine. It is amazing. The first time I used it, the Bissell picked up so much dirt that you would have sworn my carpet had never been vacuumed before! It left my carpets looking great. However, I couldn't give it five stars because on my bare floor, it just blew the dirt around, so don't buy this machine if you have lots of bare floors."
5,Authentic,I tried to order another of these and it definitely wasn't what I was looking for. This is the real deal. It works and fits perfectly.
5,exactly as ordered,order arrived in three days....super saver. saved $4.50 per box over the large chain stores.
1,poor packaging,The staples were packed very poorly. The boxes had come apart and staples were everywhere. It is very difficult to load them into the flooring nailer since they are broke apart.
2,NAILS,"The flooring nails are a great product, but way over priced. I purchased the same nails at a local center for half the price."
1,Nails came No Nailer,"Bought these Bostitch nails at the same time I bought the Bostitch Pneumatic floor nailer on Amazon. Nails came very quickly but nailer never came. Lots of excuses from Amazon and CSN but never got the nailer. Notified price of nails went down after order came. Price of Bostitch nailer went up $300. Can not say as to how they work as I have no way of using them without a nailer. Looks like the best use for them might be a paper weight. Amazon has went down a little bit in my eyes as they did not respond to what I thought was a ""Bait and Switch"" scheme. Just a lot of different excuses from Amazon and CSN."
1,Floor Cleats,Same great product as the store but a lower price. Cleats hold great but staples are more cost efficient.
3,"Product fine, but packaging really stinks.","The product (L-nails) is fine. I am happy with how they shoot and hold. The problem is the packaging. I ordered 6 boxes the first time and 4 boxes the second. In both cases, one of the boxes broke open and the ten or so nail ""clips"" disintegrated into about 75 to 80 little nail clips (even to the point of single nails). Quite a pain to have to deal with all those little guys. Hey, Stanley - Bostitch, fix your packaging! You're messing with my productivity!"
5,Great quality,"Great product, superb holding. I used these to install bruce hardwood in my hallway, and stair landings. Good price too."
4,dwill,"good nails bad packing , nails all over the place. hard to load in to gun. better off buying from the big store."
1,shipping nightmare,The nails arrived in pieces. The shipping container was sub par and thus they were almost impossible to use. The shipper was the problem not the nails. I was unable to use half of the nails....
4,Bostitch FLN-200 Flooring L-nails,"Delivered quicker than anticipated. At the time of purchase, they where cheaper than Home Depot. Worked well with the Hardcore Tools Pneumatic 2-in-1 Flooring Nailer/Stapler."
3,need more nails,"If you are installing 2 1/4"" hardwood flooring, one box(1000 nails) is needed per 100 SF - nailing every 6-8"""
1,Didn't receive as shown,"We didn't receive the nails as shown on amazon's site. We received the nails loose in a huge box, so they were broken apart and unusable. There was no box showing that the nails we received were in fact Bostitch nails. When we tried to use the nails we received they jammed or went into the wood and bent. These were totaly worthless. We went to a local store and purchased a real box of Bostitch nails and they worked perfectly. Don't waste your $ on these nails."
1,Not suitable for shipping.,"I have to mention that the nails are superb. Excellent holding power and no jams. Made in Canada, not overseas.The nails are packed in a paper box which is not suitable for shipping. Ordered 4 packs,all arrived in pieces. Bostitch should use a different packaging materialfor online stores. My advise, buy locally. It costs $5 more per 1000 than on Amazon in my local HD."
3,Poor packaging in shipment,"I was happy to receive my shipment within three days of the order but like others I was disappointed with the way the cleats were packaged. One box broke open and and several rails of cleats splintered into dozens of pieces. I guess I'll push then off to the side and hope I don't have to feed 10-20 cleats into the nailer at a time. Bottom line, they were cheaper than the big box store but since 20% are in small pieces where exactly is the savings. Not worth the hassle, buy them at HD where you can open the box and inspect them. Poor job Amazon."
2,half county,Watching DVD after the 5th song is wasting of time and one good country song. And also the proof that after all Ray Price is not a country singer. Jimmy Day is on steel guitar. I was glad it is only half of his concert.
4,Hoppin,"For the most part this album offers remarkably cynical (but perceptive) lyrics, coupled, oddly enough, with happy latin-influenced music. ""Somebody"" at the end does offer some hope, however. Musically the album is brilliant, finding many memorable grooves, mixing twangy guitars, percussion, and horns."
2,Not Very Good,"This is the closest thing to pop music that Byrne has recorded since the split of Talking Heads. It's unfortunate that it didn't work out. First of all, Byrne's voice, which usually adds energy and intrigue to the music, merely gets in the way on this album. (""Girls On My Mind"" in particular) On top of that, many of the songs are just plain irritating (""Monkey Man"",""Twistin' In The Wind"",Girls On My Mind"") or forgettable (""Hanging Upside Down"",""She's Mad"") All of that said, this album does have some good points, like the catchy refrain on ""Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)"" and another on ""Million Miles Away"". Overall, this album isn't terrible, it's just not at the level of Byrne's other solo albums."
5,"Superb, finely balanced album","Melding rock with latin sensibilities has always held a danger for all but the most gifted musicians. Byrne himself has produced a few different records in this style - Rei Momo, and a live video and tour - but these didn't really hit the spot, with the studio recording lacking the liveliness of a true latin band, and the tours sounding incoherent and unrehearsed. However ""Uh Oh"" stands out, as Bryne manages to truly hit the sweet spot, perfectly melding his dry satirical verses with the happy exhuberance of the latin band. The recording is absolutely superb, bursting with life and pointedly tongue-in-cheek lyrics.Not only my favourite recording by Byrne, but one of my all time favourite albums."
3,"A number of errors, alas","This book is fun reading, especially if you have a few minutes to spare in the smallest room in your house. At the risk of sounding picky, I do have to point out that there are some obvious errors. For example: Why do US FM station frequencies always end in an odd number? The authors claim that it's just a whim that all the FM spectrum slices (0.2 MHz each) ""start on odd number boundaries"". But this would make the FM band extend from 88.1 to 108.1: wrong!The true explanation is much simpler. The FM part of the spectrum extends from 88 to 108 MHz. The 0.2 MHz slices actually start on even boundaries, as you would expect: the lowest slice is from 88.0 to 88.2. A station on this slice has frequency 88.1, the CENTER (unmodulated) frequency of the slice, not the start. The last slice, of course, is from 107.8 to 108.0, with nominal frequency 107.9."
5,Another good book,"This is book 5 in the Tall Dark and Dangerous series...I started reading this series on the day after Christmas (7 days ago) and I have been not stop since. I can't help it, I have this need to find out what happens to the next seal member.Harvard really strikes me as an older college professor type. PJ strikes me as the sparky come from the wrong side of the tracks type. Their love is great...rough in the beginning...not sure I was comfy with all the feminist feelings that went on. Scenes were good and wow was there a HUGE bomb dropped (metaphorically speaking)...."
3,HARVARD'S EDUCATION,"FROM THE BACK COVER:For eight weeks FInCOM agent P.J. Richards is being given access to the absolutely-no-women-allowed world of the U.S. Navy SEALs, and she isn't about to be distrated by anything...or anyone. And that includes Senior Chief ""Harvard"" Becker. Harvard believes that there is no room for women in a combat zone. It's too dangerous, too tough...and with P.J. involved, too distracting. He might respect her sharp intellect and her shooting abilities, but he still doesn't want the responsibility of making sure she stays alive. But P.J. isn't a woman who backs down easily, and to her mind, Harvard has a lot to learn."
5,You got me to try it!,"After my divorce I had trouble meeting people. All my friends were dating online, but I was afraid to. My girlfriend had recommended this book to me and I was amazed! There is so much information in it! It's smart, witty and easy to read! I am also not very internet savvy, so I found its explanations really helpful. My thoughts about dating on the internet have changed immensely and I am now enjoying ""getting out there again."" Thanks, Evan!"
3,There's already many online dating books...,"... which makes it hard for me to rate this one more than an average 3-star. The problem is all books about online dating offer the same advice. When internet dating was new 10 years ago, a book such as this would have been helpful!If you are a newbie to internet dating, I recommend this book!However, if you have been dating online for a year or two, it seems the advice offered in the book are basic common sense suggestions - be honest, post a good photo, write a good positive profile!"
2,outdated,"This one is easy to read and does have some tips if you know NOTHING about internet dating. However, much of the information is outdated and not very helpful."
