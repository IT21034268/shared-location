4,4 out of 5 cuz pinocchio is a great movie but Disney fouled up the end game.,"WTF mate! Pinocchio is one of the best Disney accomplishments so i would presume the Blu ray would bring it justice...however we civilians are denied the right to view this masterpiece in it's 1080p full-screen or wide-screen glory we are forced to view Pinocchio with black side bars because some genius wants everyone to view the movie the ""Right"" way (a 1.33:1 ratio) rather than the natural 16x9 ratio of our TV)...apparently no one told the Disney staff there was plenty of room on the disk to have the full-screen, wide-screen, and this blu ray studio first ""Disney view"" I recommend the movie based on its value as a masterpiece but this new found idea called ""Disney View"" is quite upsetting and will probably ruin the lovely Snow white! soon to be released btw"
5,Pinocchio DVD,This new DVD set is wonderful. The second disc contains all kinds of additional fun things. I'm especially grateful for Amazon's low price guarantee which saved me an additional $1.00.
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS MOVIE","I first saw this movie when I was a child many, many moons ago and fell in love with it. A true classic that has held up over time. You and your kids will love it, too. If you are a Disney fan (or even if you're not) you HAVE to get this movie."
3,Cheap Way Out,Disney took the cheap way out by releasing this movie in 4x3 full screen format instead of one of the widescreen formats that Blu Ray disks are normally released in. This is the only Blu Ray disc I have seen in 4 x 3 format. I returned the Blu Ray disc because I refuse to pay Disney's premium price for a non widescreen Blu Ray of Pinoccio. I hope Disney re releases it in widescreen because it is an excellent movie.
1,Disney video,"The one I bought at a premium price was advertised as being new and sealed. It was from an affiliated store with Amazon.com The seller went by at least 3 different names and one was ?""Milano"". What I rec'd was a pirated piece of junk. When I complained, the crook said he made a mistake and would replace the video but that I should not tell Amazon that I had been sent junk. I never did get the promised video from that crook and so I stopped ordering anything outside the Amazon.com system for a long time and I still do not like the idea of ordering outside the system. I guess the only good thing to come from this is that the pirating crook did not get ahold of my credit card info because he probably would have stollen my identity and run up my bill."
1,Ooops - who let Goofy in the copy-room?,"Pinocchio is one of my favorite movies and my children love it as well. What a gift it was to get it on DVD! But upon putting it in the player today, found out that the Prince of Egypt was actually on it. The cover and holder showed Pinocchio. This was a very sad mistake by Buena Vista Home Entertainment."
1,This was a fake,Don't believe the item was authentic. Then when I contacted the vendor to return I never got a response. This was a gift and not only was I embarrassed I lost my money. This will make me hesitant to order from another vendor.
5,Best bonus material !,"Although this film is a classic and one of my favorites, I particularly loved the bonus material included in this package. The ""deleted scenes"" the ""alternate ending"" and other material make this a well-worth purchase for any film buff or persons interested in Disney and animation. It's one of the best from that golden age of classics and still holds up against the newer computer generated disappointments out there these days."
3,don't miss the book,"A real classic for sure. It's well worth it to read the book first. The story is of far more substance than the movie portrays, but the movie is a wonderful little sketch comedy and vignette with amazing artwork, animation and music."
1,playability,It wasn't clear this could not be played on a VCR in the US. that was in the small print
5,love it,"Bought this for my mother. Fast shipping, the DVD was not in the original shrink wrap but the DVD was sealed. No problems with the DVD itself it played well."
4,Nice classic,"This movie is quite different in some parts than the original Pinocchio tale - but that was typical of Disney, what with putting in musical numbers and talking animals. For a Disney-ified tale, Pinocchio was actually a pretty decent film, and one of my childhood favorites, and one of the better ones in the Disney library."
5,Disney Classic,"I'm SO glad Disney is going through their classics and making the transfer to bluray. I love the story, characters, music, among many other things. Everyone should have this classic as part of their collection."
1,Doesn't Play,Bought this as a gift for my niece and won't play in many types of DVD players. Might be burned copy from original?
4,Looks Quite Different in Adult Eyes,"This is one I know I have not seen since I was a child. For example, I completely missed the pederasty implications of ""Pleasure Island,"" where the bad boys are taken and do not come back -- at least as boys. OK, they are turned into donkeys and sold to the mines, but I suspect the Disney studios were able to recognize that a synonym for ""donkey"" is ""ass."" That's right; their asses were sold into slavery!Once again, I had forgotten most of the details, including the wonderful clocks and mechanical toys in Geppetto's shop. Or the way he set up housekeeping in Monstero's belly. He and his cat are fishing while his goldfish looks on placidly in her fish bowl.This is yet another Disney classic that is worth sharing with your children and/or grandchildren, but you may have to explain some of the more arcane aspects. 1940 was a long, long time ago."
3,"Great film, Awful Disc","First off, let me say that Pinocchio is my favorite of all the Disney animated films. Which makes it all the more frustrating that it was treated so shabbily in this DVD release. While the video and audio quality are decent, they are not nearly as good as they should have been, given the state of the technology. And, frankly, the ""supplements"" are a joke. A picture on the disc is a feature? Get with it, Disney."
5,The best Disney film of all-time!!!!!!,Pinocchio is my favorite Disney movie of all time!!!!!!! I'm glad they decided to come out with a 60th anniversary release. It is up there with such movies as Lady and the Tramp and Bambi. It is a classic a must have!!!!!!!!
5,deserves more than just 5,Pinocchio is a movie with good morals and great animation. The songs are delightful and it's a must for any Disney fan!
4,A Photographer to Think About,"Man Ray left his mark on photography not only as a photographer but as an innovator. In the book Man Ray: Paris Photographs 1920-34 he pushed the formal boundaries to create his own imaginative style. The photos as well as the layout of book have been carefully executed through his knowledge of design.This book features objects, nudes, portraits and Rayographs. The space between truth and fiction is bridged through the elements of design and his images are visually pleasing. His nudes define femininity. They are ideal for the male gaze which captures the essence of the female form through erotic eyes. It is evident that Man Ray knew the rules therefore he could break them. Rayographs were made by placing objects directly on film. Ray created graphically interesting images using this process which contained both dada and surrealist ideas."
2,pages missing,"The book was in excellent condition, except for several pages missing on the chapter of how she made the etching of the rabbit. Disappointing, to say the least, as that was the part of the book I wanted to see."
4,GREAT!!!,I have had a few bags in the past.. and kick one around once in a while with my friends. I have to say that the weight that the sand gives this bag is really great. It's excellent for stalls and tricks and just kicking it around to kill time.
3,want something ot of the ordinary?,"If you can find a copy of these short stories, you will find something out of the ordinary to read. Some stories are adolesent, some are dated, but some are interesting."
2,Borring no imagination,"Skip this one, you'll fall asleep. Most of the stories are borring, even though there are a couple of exceptions."
5,Great Woman's Wool Ski Hat,Great hat that fits even larger size heads. I purchased this for my 16 year old and she loves it! Great colors that really bring out the detail of the knitting. She also likes that it is lined so it stays in place and is less itchy than most out door hats! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new ski/winter hat!
5,awesome hat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Absolutely love my 'wool chullo fleece lined ski hat with ear flaps'........I live in Oregon and its pretty cold in the winter. This is the first cap that has kept my head and ears warm, and its pretty too. I've got lots of compliments on it. I'm going to buy another one, only without the fleece for when its not quite that cold. I love it!!"
3,Ladies Colorful Wool Ski Hat,"I wss looking for a nice, colorful wool ladies ski hat to give as a present. I found this one and tbought tbat I might like it.When I received it, I was genuinely pleased as the colors were rich and the hat seemed like it would be both warm and of high quality. I think tbe receiver of this gift will be pleased."
5,womens accessories,I love this hat for skiing. The lining kept me nice and warm in blizzard conditions. I wore it every day of my week long ski trip.
2,Only for Lawrence die-hards,"This was Lawrence's first published novel in the UK, and represents the writer's early experiment in the quest for an established style.Far too much descriptive detail, and too little narrative, to be considered an enjoyable read. It is however interesting to note the early appearance of themes that were to dominate later Lawrence works. In particular, the nature-civilisation dichotomy, which became a Lawrence trademark, is apparent here in the relationship between the cultured, educated narrator and his best friend, the raw-boned but affable farmer, George.Readers wishing to introduce themselves to Lawrence would be better advised to start with the book published two years later, and that marked the beginning of his literary reputation: ""Sons and Lovers"""
5,One of my favorite,This is not your typical Stephen King nightmare flicks. It is more thought provoking and Christopher Walken does an outstanding job of a man revived from a prolonged coma with a special ability. Even if you don't like Stephen King movies you will like this one.
4,Very good movie.,I hadn't seen this film in about 20 years. It was rougher and had more moments of horror and gore than I had remembered but Walken's and Sheen's performances were excellent and it's a good story.
3,It's ok,I bought this movie because it was the only Stephen King movie I didn't have. It was ok. I think a man would like it more that I did.
4,A complete overhaul...,"As always, the book is better, but this film does a fairly decent job of getting the point across. All the essential plot elements remain: Johnny Smith gets into an automobile accident, Johnny Smith goes into a five year coma, Johnny Smith wakes up to discover that his entire life is just about gone (girlfriend gone, job gone, legs just about useless), but in a way God has thrown him a bone by giving him the power of second sight with a simple touch of someone's hand. All the touching, heartwarming details of story remain. It's still an extremely sad story about a life gone terribly wrong, and a man's slow decent into lonely madness, and there's no doubt that this is Christopher Walken's immortal classic performance. As always, though, I beg you to read the novel first.Oh, yeah, and the music is great too..."
3,Not what you'd expect from Stephen King,"School teacher who has a car accident (Hi, Pet Sematary, again) falls into a coma, and when he awakes, he possesses a supernatural ability to predict the future at the cost of his own life as it begins to kill him, slowly. Very good movie that sort of fails to find a genre to fit into but delivers the goods with a great cast and excellent use of events to develop plot."
2,No tears for Christopher,I'm not sure what the others were writing about but the ending is no tear-jerker. This movie is weak and while Mr. Walken does his usual good performance there's not much that can be done to make this stinker any better. Definitely not a movie I would recommend to anyone.
3,Stephen King,Not as good as the book and quite dated for today's state of the art but still a good story.
3,Not as good as the book,"As is usually the case, the book was better than the movie. Steven King's writing is best left to the imagination of the reader."
3,What was David Cronenberg Thinking?,Out of all of the Stephen King novels this has to be one of the most half-assed film adaptation to date. The atmosphere wasn't there. What makes a Stephen King novel so good is that Stephen King takes the readear and puts them in the shoes of the characters who are in trouble. I mean when I read the novel The Dead Zone I became Johnny Smith. I suffered with him as he was going through the trials and tribulations after he had woken up from that coma and discovered that he had the gift of psychic ability. And I became terrified with him when he discovered the terrible fate awaiting mankind unless he acted and acted quickly. I felt none of that empathy for any of the characters in the movie.
2,Not all that great!,The only thing this movie has going for it is that Christopher Walkin is a great actor and was perfecty cast as Johnny but the movie itself is rather flat and lifeless.
2,The Dull Zone,"The movie follows the book very well. Usually I prefer it when a movie attempts to be true to the book, except when the book is written by King. King is an excellent author, but his books do not translate to film very well.The Dead Zone is a prime example of a great book that made a boring movie. There isn't enough character development to make you care what's going on. This is one case where they should have focused on one aspect of the book and left the rest out.Christopher Walken is the one reedeming factor in this movie. There is one scene where Walken gets angry and you catch a preview of some of his future roles. If you're a Christopher Walken fan then that one scene is worth the price of the DVD."
2,it's fair,"This movie wasn't that great but it's one that was relatively close to the book, unlike a lot of them. Most of the time you can read the same thing in the books and they are all out better.I wouldn't recomend buying it.. maybe renting or waiting for it to come on TV"
2,Didn't Like The Movie Or The Book!,"When I first saw this movie I thought it was okay but not the best I saw it again and I didn't like it and was totally bored. I read the book by Stephen King which I didn't really like too much either so it's not my favorite movie or book, I preferred the books and movies The Shining and Firestarter."
1,very upset,i was very upset with this movie. If you have read this book... dont watch the movie. There are so many different scenes that were switched around from the book. for example in the book johnny tutored a highschool kid not a elementery kid. there was a fire at a graduation party not a drowning. this movie swayed from the book big time!
4,THE DEAD ZONE,"A special collector's edition, The Dead Zone is well worth purchasing. Based on one of Stephen King's earlier novels, it is excitingly fast-paced and entertaining. Christopher Walken is outstanding in the starring role of the psychic who has a gift he would not have asked for, one that in the end proves life-saving on a grand scale. Buy the movie! You won't be sorry."
5,The Wolf is loose!,A truely scary film. Christopher Walkin plays the main character 'Johny' with panache. This film was a good adaption of The Stephen King book and manages to keep the audience spell bound through out. Martin Sheen plays the potential future president chillingly and overall worthy of a 5 star rating.
5,Goodie,I love this movie I remember seeing this years ago and it took me some time to find a copy I like Christopher Walken & love Stephen King movies
4,The Dead Zone lives...,"I saw the Dead Zone many years ago and was a movie I wanted in my collection. The movie, an early David Cronenberg venture, is one of those that makes you think, what would I do if I was in the same situation? A moderately strong story with good acting especially by Christopher Walken in the lead role. Throughly enjoyable and one you should see at least once if not twice."
3,One of the first,"This may be one of the few first adaptations of a Stephen King novel. Christopher Walken is a fantastic actor, but it seems something is missing in the movie. I think the director could have done a better job putting this together, seems a little disorganized and bland at times.This is another Stephen King movie that I would like to see redone again on a grander scale."
4,Watch Martin Sheen's Chilling Portrayal Of Greg Stillson,"This film is a good adaption of King's ""Deadzone."" It is a good film but not great. It is about Johnny emerging from a 5-year-long coma with extraordinary psychic powers allowing him to see visions in the past, present and future. With these powers Johnny gets an opportunity to save the world from a nuclear exchange and takes that opportunity at the cost of his own life. Martin Sheen is convincing as a psychotic Senate hopeful aspiring to be the President of the USA."
4,The Dead Zone is one frighteing & unforgettable jouney,"A unforgettable film next to CARRIE & SALEM`S LOT this is another of Stephen King`s mesmerizing novels adapted to the screen thanks mostley to the landmark performance of Christopher Walken. His chracter Johnny Smith,a school teacher who after survivng a fatal car crash inherits the ability to foresee the future. Outstanding performence from Walken Along with THE DEER HUNTER & THE DOGS OF WAR this is another classic from Christopher Walken. A horror film with this magnitude and the abillty to place a chill in your soul is something of a lost art nowadays with today`s unappealing and unoriginal Horror films."
3,Better Then The Book!,I like Stephen King and have enjoyed most of his books but I didn't like the book The Dead Zone that this movie was based on but I think this movie was okay and I think it's actually better then the book and it's very rare when a movie is actually better then the book it came from.
2,Verbose,"I feel like the message of the book is good and useful... but this could have been an essay instead of a 250 page book. Boys aren't encouraged to explore their emotions, which leads to feelings being bottled up and ignored. This can lead to emotional problems in some boys. I didn't find their case studies to be very compelling or their conclusions to be particularly helpful or actionable."
4,Raising Cain,"I photocopied the chapter ""Romancing the Stone"" about boys' developing sexuality and plan to give it to my daughter to read when she becomes interested in boys. It tells so clearly how boys will do and say anything to have sex and how they know what girls want desperately to hear. That chapter was the most interesting to me, not having grown up male."
5,Raising Cain,"I am so thankful I found this book.Emotional literacy!!!How logical!!!How horrific that we still don't know this is the most important literacy we have to master first and for most and than we can go about other achievements.I recommend this book to everyone!Not just parents,not just fathers...Thank you Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson.I am learning to understand myself and my boys!"
5,Great book for parents required book for teachers,"This is a great book. Kindlon and Thompson have provided an eloquent and readable discussion of the challenges facing boys in our society and our schools. I am a father of two boys and received my doctorate in Education a few years ago. As both a parent and educator for more than twenty years, I enjoyed reading each chapter of this book. I have also read Pollack and Gurian's books. I find Pollack pompous and arrogant in his opinions and advice. Frankly, I have not seen the separation anxieties that he describes in the boys that I have taught and counseled. Gurian draws extensive, simplistic conclusions from a select set of research findings - he seems to have predated the recent research regarding testosterone. Thompson and Kindlon, on the other hand, provide a balanced, quiet voice that relies on their years of experience with boys. Their descriptions matched my experiences and understanding of child psychology perfectly. Their advice is invaluable."
5,excellent & complete - this book deserves wider attention!,"Anyone interested in or involved in teaching, coaching or raising boys must read this. Michael Thompson and Daniel Kindlon have done their research and work with boys. This book is timely, informative, and vitally important. This book will challenge the old notion that ""boys will be boys!"" as a way of forgiving their behaviors. It reminds us that boys are as complex in their emotions as any other human being. A must read."
1,I've been marketed!,"According to the dust jacket, if you love a boy, were a boy, or care about boys and the men they become, read this book."" Well gosh, what a coincidence, that includes me! The premise of this book, that we should pay more attention to the emotional lives of boys, isn't exactly a trailblazer, considering the degree to which we've re-evaluated sex roles in recent decades. I can't help thinking that the book was devised to fill an available market niche left open by ""Reviving Ophelia."" The ""product"" is a rambling series of pop psych anecdotes (I sometimes ask, is there any other kind of psych?)and patronizing sermons from the all too male authors. God forbid that my boys should grown up to be as shallow and as self-satisfied as they."
1,a tired rehash of stuff you've heard before,"Raising Cain is a tired rehash of child-rearing advice you've heard a million times. It's too bad that parents who are willing to spend moneyand, say, six hours of reading time to learn more about their sons will be so poorly rewarded. My advice: spend that six hours with your boys, doing something fun. Save the money for pizza and ice cream."
2,"Not so great for parents, maybe good for professional counselors and such","This book contains a lot of psycho babble. It seems to be written mostly for professional family counselors and psychologists and such. For them it might be useful, but if you're a ""normal"" parent (meaning not working in such a field) then there are better parenting books out there that are much less opaque."
2,It's no Reviving Ophelia,"Largely anecdotal, this book does little to enlighten regarding the problems little boys really face and, more importantly, how to solve them. I am even more troubled by the ""namby pamby"" approach--they are little boys, not little girls, after all."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This book has been a tremendous help, even when I had no idea I needed any help. I am so grateful I have this book in my home to refer to as I embrace the jouurney of raising my three sons!"
5,"Really, REALLY good book about boys.","Not only did I learn about some of the things that my son will go through as he grows up, I learned a lot about his dad and other boys in my life. I think this had to be one of the most informative books about boys and young men I have ever read."
5,Raising Cain a must read for all who are raising or educating boys.,"This book is fantastic and written by 2 men who really know what they are talking about. It is written with clarity and in depth knowledge about boys regarding every aspect of their life. This is something that we all need to be aware of when raising boys and dealing with boys. Emotional illiteracy is widespread in our culture because of the way we socialise boys, as we don't allow them to get in touch with their feelings. This disconnection from the inner world causes much pain to him, and people who are close to him, as they often are unable to connect deeply with others, or to be truly empathetic. I applaud the men who wrote this book and I am at present working with a male client who is getting a great deal from the concepts discussed therein. It is a must read."
3,Made me think and worry more than most any book I've read,"I must say this book really shook me up. As a mother of 2 boys, I was upset to read about how cruel boys can be to each other as teens, and by how closed off they become from their emotions. The book did a wonderful job of pointing out the scary parts of raising boys, but in my opinion anyway did not do enough to answer the question they raise---how can we prevent all this awful stuff from happening? The advice given is what most parents would try to do anyway---keep the lines of communication open, be there but don't be smothering, etc. I would like to know more about how specifically I can help my sons weather childhood and grow into happy adults. After reading this book, I think one could get the impulse the only good way to do this is keep them home at all times away from all the cruelty!"
2,Predictable,"The book may be good for people whom have little understanding of children in general. Of course boys have emotions and ofcourse they are trained not to express those. It's up to the parents to ensure that boys learn to express their emotions. I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it, instead of stories of angry, sad boys."
4,Good look into the emotional life of boys.,"I found this book to be very insightful and interesting. I had to read a book for a college psychology course and this was on the book list. The book is formatted in a very interesting way. The writers do not simply give you a buch of information about boys and their thoughts. They focuss on experiences and stories they have encountered with boys. They then use these experiences and interperet them and relate them to what they see as an area of concern for boys. Things they consider is emotions, violence, relationships, and boy sterotyping. Because it is almost a collection of stories the book continues to be very comelling. Like the cover states I would say that this is ""...required reading for anyone raisin-or educating-a boy"""
5,Best boy guide ever,"I don't know what I did without this book. It is the best insight into why boys do what they do and the real feelings and emotions we don't see. I have recommended it to all my friends with boys and would recommend that if you have a boy, this is a must read."
5,Awesome,"An absolute must-read for ALL parents of both boys AND girls. Being a feminist, I had to keep reminding myself that when we take care of our boys we also take care of our girls. It has transformed the ways I look at my son and also my husband and other men in my life.Along with Reviving Ophelia it should be mandatory reading for all parents!(...)"
1,Personal Beliefs and Values,"This book is more for those who believe in a liberal approach to raising their children. While I believed that this book was focusing on treating your child with respect and love...teaching your child in turn to respect and love...it was apparent from reading it that the focus was more on allowing your child to be free from criticism and discipline. I would not suggest this book for anyone who believes in more traditional approaches to raising their children. Also, I do have concern regarding the fact that the authors are the parents of daughters and have written this book by mere observation through a clinical setting."
5,How to Play the Hawaiian Ukulele: 10 Easy Lessons,Great Book! Really easy to follow with plenty of good pictures of finger positions.
3,Depends on how much you already know about music.,"Personally, this book did NOT help me learn how to play the ukulele. In some parts, it seems like you should know what certain things mean (such as music notes that are connected and so on.) Strumming is confusing, I wasn't sure if they meant to strum every string or just one or one and another! I found sites giving tips and info about how to play the ukulele and that gave me more info in less time and it helped me learn way more than the book. This book seems more helpful to people who have an understanding in what they are planning to do (they are ""music savvy""). I honestly regret buying this book, but thats me personally."
4,Hawaiian Ukulele,Package received prior to Christmas even thought they couldn't promise early delivery... Outstanding! Package well wrapped to avoid water damage and prompt delivery.Thank you!
3,its ok,"this movie is okbut lets face it, hogan is not the greatest actor in the world.i like no holds barred betterget that instead"
5,Classic!,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift that never was able to be given so I opened it up and had a movie night with friends.I am in no way saying this is an award winning movie with award winning performances, but it does include a star-studded cast and plenty of corny jokes that are so indicative of the time period. My friends and I had an amazing time re-watching this childhood staple and enjoyed the humorous nostalgia that came along with it!"
3,"Suburban Commando, Hulkamania forever","It helps to like Hulk Hogan, but most families should enjoy this light fare. Sure the special effects are B grade but you can overlook that considering when it was made and the small budget they will suffice. The acting is a little hammy, but I still found this a fun hour and a half. I'm always glad to see light entertainment and Christopher Lloyd and Hulk Hogan are definitely a good match up in this comedy. When an architect and his family are hurting for money they rent out a room. Little do they know the man that rents it is a space mercenary with good causes and a special resentment towards humans. Or so he says as we soon see he may have a heart afterall. The action gets interesting when bounty hunters come looking for Hulk. Good quality DVD with reasonably good replay."
4,"Hmmm, not too bad",A 90's edition of a cheezy 50's creature feature; and it's actually good. Who'd a thunk it?
5,Tremors-Probably the BEST film I have ever have ever viewed!,"If you want to see a movie that is so creepy and fun then you must see this movie! If you actually put yourself in the characters shoes then you would see how scary it would be. I mean worms coming out of the ground without warning and eating you alive! That's scary. Then factor in the humor of Kevin Bacon and you have a formula that could make Sisckle & Ebert give it two thumbs up! Lets just say YOU must buy this movie, if you don't you'll want to see again and again anyway."
5,A fun movie with a great cast and tight screenplay.,"Tremors tells the classic story of a small community fighting for survival against underground monsters. It's classic horror-movie stuff with a twist: unlike most Hollywood horror flicks, the characters look and talk like real people, and as the story progresses, you actually root for them to win. The last horror flick I saw where I didn't cheer for the monsters was the original 'Night of the Living Dead' (1969). The cast makes the people of Perfection real to us, and the dialogue is as sharp and funny as the best Mel Brooks movie. The action is fast-paced, but the tone is always positive. This film is great fun; I never get tired of watching it. Be sure to check out the ""Making of..."" feature and the original ending; excellent documentaries from the film-makers. You'll enjoy this disk for years to come."
5,Laugh out loud funny,"I thought this movie was hilarious. The two main characters Val and Earl were the best part. Everytime they tried to leave Perfection, something would stop them. ""We just waited one day too long to leave""The 'Graboids' are voracious eaters who travel through dirt like fish through water. They sense vibrations caused by those walking on top, reminiscent of the giant worms from Dune. They then come to the surface and have a snack.Great movie. Not really scary, no sex or profanity. Good for the whole family."
3,Good movie - bad transfer,"The film Tremors is as good as ever - campy, funny, silly, and lots of fun. However, this HD-DVD transfer is not worthy of the medium. The transfer improvement consists only of heavily over-sharpened footage (artifacts and edge halos) and way too much contrast. If you are even slightly discerning about the quality of your video (and if you're watching HD-DVD, I assume you are), then this rendition is somewhat disappointing.Still, it's Tremors, and that counts for a lot :)"
5,Great Movie!,Tremors is such a good movie because it is not a horror movie but and adventure movie. It has a good touch of comedy in it too and that makes is it great. Definitely a must see.
5,Great Movie Ahoy!,"Better than Disney! Has nevadie rednecks, men fight the best, got a lotta guns, and I like it and the great Mummy movie. I hate Disney's poltical correctness, and choose this over it!"
3,okay horror movie,Kevin Bacon was probably the best thing about this movie.the scary parts werent very scary though.still worth seeing because Kevin Bacon and a couple creepy scenes
2,For fans only,I wasn't pleased with the video and audio transfer. The bottom line is that this HD DVD is for fans only.
3,Vacant,This movie was kinda empty. It was about killer worms that live undergorund terrorizing a small town in no mans land. Not exactly a horror flick but worth adding to the collection.l
3,trembly,"trmours was a great film. the hilariously bad one-liners, combined with the horrible acting (by some people), mixed with the failed attempts to scare me into watching the rest of the movie really made it worth watching. I doubt that you'll find a movie that will make you laugh harder. Where Ghostbusters got stupid, Tremors keeps on truckin'. no explanations, no nothing, and the girl didn't even get naked! This is definately a flick to watch with a group of guy buddies, or to snuggle up to with your girl. I'd've given it 5 stars if the girl had been hotter. she looked like a ... porn star, though, so i had to take off 2 stars from this C-Movie. enjoy!"
5,I absolutely love the movie!,"Love the special effects, the characters and the plot. Val & Earl may be country handymen, but they are heroic - very responsible. Rhonda the seismologist student is smart and a survival. Burt & wife are a matching pair. Great potrayal of Val & Rhonda subtle attractions. And the creatures, they learn fast. Each can only be destroyed in a different way, first by accident upon hitting RC drain head on, second by elephant gun, third by ""bomb fishing technique"" and last by tricking it into jumping off the cliff. Absolutely great movie!"
4,One of my gulity pleasures,If you want a good spoof of the old 50' & early 60's horror movie then go no further. Its a great film to watch during some of your down time when ever that happens.
5,But under the ground...,"In homage to 1950's giant bug movies Tremors is about giant mutant worms that suck up people under the ground. The greatest thing about this film is the outlandish characters and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously. The movie is definately more of horror movie than the sequels, but there are some very good comedy bits instead of just having a straight up comic relief character. The special effects are genuin, no CG crap, or mat paintings. The acting is funny, Michael Gross is more of an (...) in this movie than a hero like he is in the others, but I still like him better than the two leads. Worth every penny, one of my favorite movies."
1,"You are kidding, Right?","This is possibly the worst movie I have ever had to sit through, and believe me, I have seen some really horrible movies. The acting is deplorable. The ""special"" effects aren't special. It was a dog. No, that is an insult to that majestic animal. My husband is an Ed Wood fan. Even those movies have a comical appeal to them, whereas this movie is nothing short of inane. If there is a God in heaven, this movie will fade into obscurity, never to be heard from again."
4,Fun to Watch,"This movie clearly shows that the cast and the director didn't take the movie seriously. But that's okay because Tremors is fun to watch, hilarious in some scenes, and not too much blood and gore to make it just like a horror flick. All the actors played their parts very well and the plot is good enough for a movie like this. In fact, my major dissapointment is that the monsters don't look anything like the thing on the cover.All,in all, a great video to watch when trying to relax or having a party."
4,"Stupid, but not that bad","Well...the idea of the movie is...uh...well STUPID! But it is not that bad actually, It is very funny and Kevin Bacon is...oh...soo sexy. if you want to see a movie who's scary, find another one, but if you want a funny ( And a little bit creepy ) one, I highly recommend it!"
4,Tremors,"""Tremors"" is a delightful surprise of a monster movie, taking advice from the old-fashioned 1950s films of its kind. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward star as a couple of independent cusses that come across an extraordinary discovery--a decapitated sheep rancher and his gruesome devoured flock. Along with a earthquake specialist, they are forced to fight for their lives against a pack of underground flesh-eating, giant worms. Superb performances from Bacon and Ward, who carry the film with their charming wit and ruthless attitudes. Excellent special effects and a script that doesn't take itself too seriously makes ""Tremors"" one of the most entertaining, campy monster movies of the last ten years. Director: Ron Underwood. Cast: Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross, Reba McEntire, Victor Wong. Rated PG-13 for violence, gore, and language. 98 minutes."
4,A definite classic of mosterous proportion!,"Tremors combines comedy, adventure and action into one film that will always be remembered as a classic. If you enjoy Sci-fi and action based movies then this is a right choice for you. Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and Michael Gross all live in Perfection, Nevada where the graboids start attacking. Armed with Burk's arsenal of M-16s, Uzis, shotguns, handguns, these graboids don't stand a chance or do they? One most memorable scenes is ""Uzi for U"", in which a graboid crashes into Burk's basement where his Wall of weaponry is located, and Burk and his wife use a plethora of guns to fire numerous bullets into the graboid. Although the movie is completly entertaining, the DVD lacks 5.1 digital sound, and has limited special features."
4,Very entertaining,Giant killer worms? It's better than it sounds. It never takes itself too seriously and maintains interest by posing a series of problems that the characters solve intelligently. I think this film accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do--entertain with a clever script about people who react to the unbelievable in a believable way.
4,A Classic!,"For me, the word ""classic"" means a movie that has stood the test of time. I believe ""Tremors"" has stood the test of time. I still enjoy putting it on now and again."
3,Cool Flick,"Another ""better-than-I-expected"" movie. Bacon is okay, Fred Ward is solid (as always), but Michael Gross & ?!Reba McIntyre?! steal this movie! Worms were never so unpredictable. A six-pack flick that will make you jump, laugh and pause-while-you-piss. Recommended."
5,Excellent!!!!,I've seen parts of this movie many times when it's shown on TV and I decided to get my own DVD 2 months ago. Since then I've probably seen it 30 times. This movie is really a classic. All the main characters are lovable and they have great chemistry together. A must have in any DVD collection.
2,Classic movie,"Movie was good but the delivery was poor. Movie feed continuously stopped & started, So far not a fan of the service"
4,"I laughed, my wife was startled!",A funny cult classic. Everybody should watch it at least once just to get a feel for the genre.
4,ACTION PACKED AND FUNNY,Lots of action and comedy with great peformances by Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon. By far the best of them.
3,liked it,this is a pretty good horror movie. I would suggest this movie to die hard horror fnas though.
1,Please,"I can't believe they made a movie this bad, and worse yet i sat and watched it.In the 1950's this would have made my all time monster list when i was 10 years old.The best part is when they showed Finn Cater bare legs.By the why i found myself rooting for the worms."
2,Disappointing reflections on a life,"I found this book boring and disappointingly wretched. Some of the good insights the author shared were overwhelmed by a drawn out book of what seemed like incurable self-pity. This mood unfortunately permeates the book, preventing the reader from seeing someone who is learning about herself and God through the hard knocks of life. As the book progresses, ""inner reflection"" turns into a continued wallowing in the quagmire of the past, leaving the reader annoyed rather than sympathetic. Furthermore, this is one of those books that needed an editor to prune it before it went to the publishers. The book is 205 pages long, but Bondi could have said everything she needed to say in 1/3 of that length. Her repetition is annoying. This book has potential that a good editor could make use of, but as it is, it isn't worth reading."
5,"Learning from revelation, God is good--not terrifying.","Systematic theology or memoir? Yes. The organization and intent is theological leading us from our existence in God, our humanity, our desire for the good, crucifixion, resurrection, and beyond. The method is to use her own life to lead us through the topics. Bondi suffered from traumatic childhood experiences including bad revival preaching. She was maimed by an image of a wrathful God that demands our sacrifice. Through study, prayer, and revelation, she learns that God, as God and as a human being, came among us to bring us healing....Read Chapter 4 before going to hear any Good Friday or Easter sermons."
3,Beautiful and depressing,"Roberta Bondi is well grounded in theology and church history and she blends wonderfully her personal stories with this knowledge of the faith. What is especially beautiful and moving is her realization of the true meaning of God's love she found in her Aunt Ree and in Mother Jane at the Anglican Benedictine Monastery. Her mother's sacrificial life and valuing of beauty were also ways she began to ""know God"". The only man who fared well was Richard. What is lacking for me in this book is what we can learn about God from maleness. Her life experiences, especially with teachers, were so cruel. The book becomes bogged down in her depression, and I did too! The repetitiveness of her memories was confusing and unnecessary. Perhaps some editing would help, but then perhaps we do repeat those most memorable stories as we try to make meaning of them!"
3,"3 stars for Marty Balin, but...","...otherwise avoid this. Buy a Jefferson Airplane or Jefferson Starship compilation or album instead. The songs here are all great. But, these are remakes. It even says on the album cover, ""recorded in 1999."" Balin's hayday certainly wasn't 1999. His voice is in top shape, but my advice to you would be to buy an Airplane or Jefferson Starship album or compilation. That is truly the way you will get 'Marty Balin's Greatest Hits.'Unless you are an Airplane/Starship or Marty Balin collector, just avoid this. He sounds great. However, there is one positive: The interviews on disc two are excellent. But, it just can't save the CD."
1,Crouching Frenchman - Hidden Plot,"Apparently in 17th Century France, the laws of gravity were suspended for a time. Everyone leaps around on wires to the point that it is getting silly. The swordfighting is O.K. but, it's heavly influenced by Wu Shu Kung Fu which is understandable given the stunt coreographer for the movie. The acting is wooden with half the cast speaking with a French accent and everyone else speaking Californian.Justin Chambers can't pronounce D'Artagnian, it sound like he is saying ""Darten"" overall, it's not that great a version of the Three Musketeers."
3,"It's not Errol Flynn, but it is fun","I've never understood the tidal wave of revulsion for The Musketeer. It has a lot of problems - Peter Hyams' typically limited cinematography that rations color like it was wartime, the atrocious swordwork from the blandest bunch of Musketeers ever to have a camera pointed at them, the worst credits sequence of all time and an impressive ladder fight that is really just a reprise of stunt director Xin Xin Xiong's own work in Once Upon a Time in China - but for all that it's an enjoyable romp and David Arnold's unapologetically fullblown romantic score (quite possibly based on his rejected score for Cutthroat Island) is rather splendid. Certainly as modern-day swashbucklers go, it's better than most. The DVD extras are pretty perfunctory though."
1,Enough with the Musketeers,"It's not so much the fact that there have been far too many Musketeer films, as the fact that this movie stinks!!!The acting is totally atrocious!!! SOme of the worst acting I've seen on film. Mena Suvari was so good in American Beauty, but in this dud she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.Whoever that guy is playing D'artanan...he looked a bit like Chris O'Donnell, who did play this character in the three musketeers, he needs to take some acting classes or find a new career. What a bore!While this fellow was nice to look at, he was such a bad actor! He needs to just stick to something easy, like male modeling.This is just another attempt at a swashbuckler film, and it failed miserably. Reminds me of some made for t.v. movie that might show up on the WB network.Watch the Musketeer film with Chris O'Donnell and Kiefer Sutherland. It's a much better made film."
3,It's fun but that's about all you can get from this film.,"Peter Hyam's should take lessons from Steven Speilberg or even James Cameron at making a entertaining film most of his films are garbage and they don't amount to anything except agood time but to expect to pay 5 to 9 dollars for his movieswhen most of them are just straight to video releases is tomuch to contemplate.If you expect to get a good telling ofthis classic then maybe you should look at some of the british productions or even Disney's 3 Musketeers good fight scenesand but no where near as good as the matrix Justin Chamberswho plays D'artaign who couldn't act his way out of a paperbag who plays the hero like a cardbord cutout is obviouslyhere as look's , Mina Suvari is given ditzy cardboard linesand Tim Roth what good actor he is wasted with a one demensional charachter who is just bent on killing but if you watch this forfun you will get that out of it."
1,Fluff and Drivel: Perfect waste of film,"With a ""pert near"" absence of plot, acting, and storyline, Musketeer falls flat on its face. What looks to be a pseudo-copy of the Disney version with Oliver Platt et al, is a hopeless effort with truly awful screenwriting, character development, and fight scenes that imploy so much cloth and whirling that it's impossible to tell who ever gets wounded. I distinctly notice within the first five minutes, however, that the film was quite dead. Please don't make me ever watch a film where most actors have a British accent, but the lead actor mumbles along with an L.A. drawl. Please don't make the mistake of renting this movie: save your money, watch the Disney version instead, which should rent for about a buck at your local video store. You'll thank me for it someday."
1,ugh!,"I'm not sure who I am more dissapointed in: the lead actor or the director. Maybe I am too used to watching actors who know how to deliver their lines, but clearly Justin Chambers does not. The utter lack of passion in his delivery gave me the impression that the director wanted him to read his lines as quickly as he could in order to get the movie over with as soon as possible. I don't blame him."
1,I wish there was a zero star..,Unless something comes out in the future to trump this...It's going to go down for me as the worst film of all time. If you have a pet peeve that ruins a movie for you then it is probably in here. I feel symphathy for Tim Roth who must have took this role on a dare.I felt so blindsided when I watched this because I was not expecting the utter trash this film is. The negative review in the Spotlight Review section are right on the money. You couldn't pay me to watch this again. Too bad there isn't a zero star.
1,How did this happen?,"If you have any respect for a story, characters or an era...DONT WATCH THIS. The names resemble the characters from a classic story written by Andre Dumas. This is about as far as the similarity goes. This is a big budget disaster. Did they try to keep it real by lighting the night scenes with candles? It provides a washed out set which might have been its redeeming feature.Dumas is turning in his grave."
1,The worst ever,"This is absolutely the worst 17th century movie I have ever seen.Words cannot describe how much it revolted me.They could do a better job if they would not try to make a film at all.If halfway through the movie, the actors began to turn into lizards, it would not have surprised me.Controlling the urge to vomit was hard to say the least.As an armourer, reenactor, historian, and having studied the sword arts for more than two decades, I can honestly say that I believe in my own heart that Micky Mouse could have played the lead role and the little pigs could have been the Three Musketeers, which by the way, we do not even get to know the Musketeers in the movie, due to the focus being on superhuman acts of levitation and flight.But if you must watch it, please bear in mind that this movie is pure fantasy when it comes to any historical value and I would not recommend it even to children if you ever want them to learn ""real"" storylines, from ""real"" books, based on ""real"" history."
2,Uhhhh... Umm... There is little to like about this movie...,"But I can't bring myself to give it only one star. Probably because the fight coriographer seemed to put so mush effort into the thing... too bad most of the fight scenes were either too dark to see what was going on, or badly shot making the fight scenes a confusing mess. Anyway, I was actually going to write a much longer review of this movie, but there is no way I could do better than wild_man_dave from Austin who said just about all that needed to be said. The only thing that I want to add is that if you are a fan of the Musketeer books like I am the only way you will ever enjoy this movie (even as a cheesy action) is to make sure you see this movie as having no connection what so ever to the Musketeer books."
3,Needs work...but fair,"A good action film where Chambers makes a noticeable first hand appearance. And the role Roth plays does add some price to the movie. But, there are some things that are needed to improve this DVD."
3,Say what you will...,"I found this movie extremely enjoyable. I didn't go to see the movie because of the THREE MUSKETEERS, after all it's original title was D'Artagnan. So, to be honest I went to see Mena Suvari and was quite pleased by the overall result of the film. I will admit that there was some poor editing. For example, when all the Musketeers arrive to help D'Artagnan he greets his horse wearing his blue musketeer cloak. In the very next scene he is not wearing it, and it is handed to him. I noticed this in the movie theater and was excited because to be honest, I'm not usually that quick.BUT! If you enjoy movies that take you to another place and another time, then by all means this is a decent movie worth checking out. Or if your Mena Suvari fan, of course she's cute in this too! Enjoy!"
2,"One for all, and all for blah!","I love swashbuckling movies. There are far too few made now so it is always with excitment when one is. But in the end this adaptation just does not come through. Tim Roth is excellent as the villain. Stephen Rhea has some good moments as the Cardinal. But they never really let him shine. Porthos was a rare find in this film, he had most of the best lines.D'Artangan is too American to really work, he was a CK model after all.The action scenes were poorly done, the fencing bad and the wirework way too obvious. It just does not work well. I hope they continue to make films with flashy swordplay and all the things that make us like a good old adventure film. But sadly this one is not it."
1,At least the title was right,"THE musteteer was about ""A"" musteteer. The whole story was horrible. You don't have to be a fan of the older Musteteer movies to know this was BAD. My advise is to watch the 15 second preview of the movie. This displays the best action that takes place in the entire movie and you can't tell just how bad the acting was. I wish I never wasted my time watching it and I was able to watch it free. Just don't bother with this one."
2,The Bad & The Good,"The star of the show is Justin Chambers and he gets incidental billing which is ridiculous despite his lack of acting skills. Having a weak lead actor is not the way to have box-office success. Stupid dialog doesn't help either, along with the Rambo action mentality in which the good guy doesn't get hit from close range.On the upside, some of the action scenes were spectacular, the best swordplay I've ever seen. The ones at the beginning and the end of the film were the best, with some incredible stunt work.This movie is beautifully photographed, too. Tim Roth was a good villain, as usual, and the heroes - even if they couldn't act - were fun to watch. The language is tame in here and the film should be rated PG, not PG- 13."
2,Mediocre at best,"I will not review this based on the book, as I was never a big fan of the book anyways, but on the film itself.Mostly, I simply found most of the characters to be bland and lifeless, with the notible exception of the villian Febre, and the plot and dialogue to be fairly weak and unexciting.The swordfighting skills displayed in the movie were dazzling, but (as another reviewer also mentioned) considering that everyone appeared almost identicle, it was a little hard to tell at times who was fighting whom. Also, while again the fight scenes were dazzling, there was no practicle reason why some of the more over the top ones were even engaged in. I am referring mostly to the fight outside the tower on ropes (why didn't someone attempt to cut D'Artagnan's rope instead of engaging him in an ariel fencing match?) and the fight on the ladders (why would Febre give up stable ground to fight D'Artagnan on unsure footing?)."
1,Why are there soooo many ladders here???,"While my wife and I are fans of this genre of film, we were at first appalled, and then disgusted by this poorly executed version. Some people have praised the fight sequences, but I found them lacking for the most part, and laughable in others--esp. the men on ropes on the castle's turret, and in the room full of ladders. Why were there so many ladders there anyway? Most disturbing were the inconsistencies in the plot. Why doesn't the hero make it back to the queen BEFORE the bad guys whom he beats up at the river scene? Why does he ride to Paris rather than to the ferry, where he could have saved Lord Buckingham and foiled the cardinal's plot? Why was this movie even made?? Save your money...we were disappointed even though we only rented it."
1,"Wow, this movie was a sad attempt of entertainment","Allright. I fell asleep. I wasn't even tired and I fell asleep. I never fall asleep. That's sad.If I could give this 0 stars I would have. The movie sounds interesting, but it makes little sense and has an ending that could of been guessed five minutes into the movie.Don't watch it. Please. Unless you really need some sleep."
1,Insult to Dumas and all fans of the genre,"Is it possible to give **minus** five stars? I feel ashamed at being forced by Amazon.com to offer this debacle even 1 star.This film, from its very beginnings, had me saying aloud what an incredible mistake it was to waste good money on buying it.And an even greater insult was to squander the not inconsiderable talents of Tim Roth and Stephen Rea. I could only shake my head in disbelief as scene after horrid scene unfolded.It felt like some of the worst fan fiction I've ever read. And the finale with the ladders? Obviously the stunt coordinator has spent his entire life living in a box with no air holes, and nothing but Jackie Chan movies to help lighten his otherwise empty hours.Ten thumbs down, way down."
1,Quite possible the worst movie of all times. 0 stars,"This movie [stinks]. The story is nothing like the original, the acting is horrific, the swordfighting utterly ridiculous.The scene that sums it all up is when the guards won't chase after a carriage going about 1 mph and everyone escapes.I have no idea how on earth anyone could make a movie so terrible. Extremely torturous to watch. Do not buy it, do not rent it. In fact, just read the book, which is awesome."
3,musketeer madness,I did not enjoy this film as much as I did the first time I saw it. Maybe I grew up?
1,"Don't buy it !! This is not a movie, but a joke in the dark!","The picture is dark, and so dark that sometimes you can't even see the movie !!This is incredible, actors are speaking like if they were reading their text. No emotion, no feeling !What a deception !!"
1,"Insulting, Monsieur!","Born and raised in France I will tell you this movie is a supreme insult to Mr. Alexandre Dumas! The original masterpiece has been hacked to bits by a Hollywood mob hooked on fluff and with no regards whatsoever for substance; the characters are shallow, the acting without flavor and the the whole movie altogether pointless. The fighting scenes would have been enjoyable had I not been bored to tears by the senseless rubbish stuffed in between them.I give it one star for the mere reason the Amazon does not offer the possibility of a lower grade. Save your money, buy the book instead!"
1,What a shame,"Wow, it is really really bad movie. I would rate it a B-Hong-Kongmartial arts movie (not even just B-movie). I wonder who came up with this ``wonderful'' idea to introduce Chinese fighting into this classical story. Complete failure. Jerking plot (and just motion, even in fighting sequence). Clothing was Ok and Mena Suvari acted well. Actually, many actors were potentially good, BUT the director and ``fighting horeographer'' are amazingly not good."
1,This is not a movie for people who enjoy watching movies!,This movie is outrageous and ridiculous and stupid and corny and just not one to watch and enjoy and absorb often. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this mish mash of scenes. It don't make much sense. Very little character development and even less fun...
1,I can't believe I saw this worthless piece of crap.,"I just want to say that I feel sorry for the wasted Blockbuster coupon - ""rent one movie get another free"".So I rented ""Heist"",which is another story, and this ""masterpiece"".People from Newark of De United States might enjoy this [junk] but not me.My advice to all who concider to buy or rent this movie, don't do it."
2,justin didn't do justice,"i felt this was just a mish mash of scenes. it didn't flow nicely along and the star could no way handle the lead. after seeing MAN IN THE IRON MASK, you saw the unity of the musketeers, something i didn't get out of this. 5 of us watched it together and in the end we all agreed it was pretty boring."
2,You've seen it before....no really you have,"The Musketeer is just the same as the 3 Musketeer story that has been told over about 6 to 8 times already. All of those a better than this although The Musketeer has a few entaining sword battles at least and Tim Roth is good as the villain. Although Tim Roth's villain with the eye patch has been seen before and is nothing new. Michael Wincott was very good in the same role in the Disney 3 Musketeers film too. Plus the end fight between Justin Chambers and Tim Roth involving ladders is kind of entertaining but it makes you wonder why all those ladders are even there though. If they were gonna make yet another one, they could of at least offered an original story. The Iron Mask wasn't fantastic but at least it gave the Musketeers something new to do."
4,"If you love Latin Music, Antonio Banderas or Armand Assante.","Ok, so Armand Assante's cuban ""accent"" isn't exactley convincing and the sparks between Dolores (Antonio's wife) and Cesar go nowhere, BUT, the music, dancing and THOSE GUYS are AWESOME!!! This continues to be one of my very favorite movies. The story is simple and predictable and that's okay because it's so much fun. There are some creative bits thrown in that make the familiarity of story just a bit different and the music is really phenominal-I want to get up and dance everytime I see it!The book definitely should be read, but AFTER seeing the movie-it's darker and will detract from the fun of the film. Oh, by the way, Antonio has NEVER looked better!"
4,Not just for Latinos,"For those who have read the Hijuelos book from which this film is adapted, you may be disappointed because it lacks the detail that the book provides. However, the visuals provided by ensemble performance scenes and stunning performances by the entire cast let you even deeper into the world of the Latino music scene of 1950's New York City. The story is as moving as the music is splendid. Get this movie for those late nights when a little glamour and heartbreak is needed."
3,MAMBO KINGS,"I found this movie just average, but then I might have expected more from this film because of all the hype it had been given."
2,Dull and unimaginative,"Very disappointing drama (done in by a cliche-ridden script and rather uninspiring performances) of two Cuban brothers coming to America to make a name for themselves. Banderas and Assante aren't believable for a second as the two Cubanos, neither is the love affair between Banderas and Moriarty."
1,Very Bad Movie,"This is really one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It does an injustice to the Pulitizer Prize winning novel titled ""The Mambo Kings Play Songs Of Love"" which the movie is based on.If you must see this movie, check it out at a local library, or rent it, but don't spend the money to own this video. You're much better off reading the novel."
4,Great Film. Exhilirating And Romantic.,"""The Mambo Kings"" is an exhilirating and sweet, romantic story. I totally liked it. I'm Hispanic so I appreciate the great work done in this film. Antonio Banderas gives an entertaining performance and the music is pure enjoyment! I especially liked the cinematography and dramatic elements of the screenplay. ""The Mambo Kings"" is just a pure delight and good time at the movies. Cubanos will really like it too! This is a fun film that's sweet, heartbreaking, wildly erotic and romantic. One of the best films based on a Latino subject ever."
4,"Glad it is available, but this is not restored","It is great to have this Youngson compilation available on DVD in America, but the print quality is only fair. The images are occasionally a bit washed out, and the print is not as sharp as what can usually be found on DVD. It is perfectly watchable, about as good as broadcast TV once was, but it is not at the level of restored DVD quality. The film itself is great, with clips from many great Laurel and Hardy silent classics, and material on their solo material as well. I would have to recommended it to Laurel and Hardy fans, but with reservations in that it is not typical DVD quality, but closer to typical broacast TV quality. I guess five stars for the movie and three for the quality would average a four star rating."
2,Laurel & Hardy Perils,"The Further Perils of Laurel and HardyI received this item this week(March 7 2008) & it was one I did not know was avalable & saw thru a link. I have the other items in this Youngson series from other publishers late last year. This one is poor to, say the least, with faded & washed-out images although the sound is OK. The grain is very high and contrary to another review, PAL TV in Australia in the 1950s & 60s did not look anything as bad as the images in this DVD. The other Youngsons that came out last year were better although the highest priced one did leave a lot to be desired in picture quality also but not like the Further Perils. If only Warner bros would buy more of these things for extras on their great DVD releases then we would have restoration similar to what they have provided on at least one L&H; DVD set. But to have this title in the collection gets us to more completion of the Youngson compilations on DVD."
2,not effective,"I was looking for something with progressive relaxation. The script of this cd basically tells you to go to sleep over and over again, more annoying than relaxing."
2,Very Brief and Unoriginal; didn't work for me at all,"This sleep CD resembles some other guided imagery CDs I own, but this one is rather generic and nothing special. For example, I could imagine myself making up a meditation like this quite easily. The entire meditation lasts only 17 minutes, followed by 17 minutes of music. Mary Maddox doesn't have a lot to say--just ordinary things like, ""breeeeth deeeeply, in and out..."". Personally, I don't enjoy her voice, either; it's too syrupy and sing-songy for me, and it irritates me when she draws words out so much. This is my opinion and my experience. I am glad that others have had success with this; but I can't write a fake review just to get votes. It may help you make your decision if you are a hard-core insomniac. I do like some guided imagery CDs, for example, those by Bellaruth Naperstak. I'll be trying more CDs from amazon, and posting reviews about my experiences with them."
2,Somewhat Helpful,OK but not great. The female voice is not very soothing. I recommend Susie Mantell's Your Present; I believe it is far more effective.
3,Sleep A Little Easier.,"I did find this more helpful than not, however, the woman's voice is not very pleasant. The music is very relaxing and nice, but then the woman's voice pops in there unexpectedly and startles you. There's got to be better out there!"
4,Works Well,"I've been using this for a couple of weeks and have noticed an improvement in my sleep pattern. I didn't really think that it would work, but it did. I'm impressed."
1,Big Disappointment,I found Mary's voice hard to listen to. It was too shaky to keep my focused on relaxing. I can no longer listen to the CD. I would not recommend this CD to anyone.
5,"Very enjoyable, very effective","I have used this CD now for about three months. It is not only very pleasant to listen to, it is also very intelligent. Mary suggests that you not 'try' to sleep, but just relax and pay attention to your body and thoughts. As you do this, you slowly relax more and more until you effortlessly slip into sleep.Now, when I lay down to sleep, I automatically start to scan my body, readjust my position until I feel comfortable, and observe my thoughts. As I do this, I often fall asleep without the CD.Highly recommended."
4,Sleep Easy: Guided Meditation for Deep Rest,"At first I didn't like the CD because the woman's voice seemed a little to hippy-trippy, laid back to the point that was distracting. BUT I love it now, because her voice has a relaxed soothing quality. It's also very helpful to me that the whole point of the CD is being ""easy,"" relaxing. I don't have to concentrate on golden light or relaxing my toes or anything. As the name suggest it's just eeeasy."
3,Mostly Recycled Material,"In general, I love the Maddoxes' work. Mary has an amazing, soothing voice and is very articulate and imaginative in her descriptions of the thoughts and feelings and ideas she guides you though. But this CD seemed to be a recycling of the 'Just Relax' CD material, sometimes verbatim. I didn't hear anything new, which was disappointing. I would have preferred to be taken on a journey. Andrew Weil has double CD set about getting to sleep and the journeys on the second CD about preparing for sleep and moving towards sleep (as if you are on a beach and walking slowly into water) are more what I was hoping for.I also would prefer a second meditation for sleep rather than a whole other track of music. Music, for some reason, keeps me awake. A soothing voice is more likely to help me relax and sleep."
2,Received a used set,"Nothing fundamentally wrong with it, but the manufacturer's original box had been opened before and rather clumsily taped back together, and the ""aluminum"" case is covered in small scratches and dents. I don't have the time to return the set for replacement since it was bought as a gift for an upcoming occasion. Disappointing."
5,Great Lesson Plans And Workshop,"I purchased this book in order to attend a workshop given by Mary Ann Johnson and was very pleased with both the workshop and the book. Tutankhamun: Time Capsule contains about twenty lesson plans, which could be used with a variety of ages and skill levels. They are fast paced, hands-on, and fun. I wish I had attended this workshop before viewing the King Tut exhibit, which is currently appearing in Seattle. Mary Ann Johnson has a wealth of knowledge and experience in this subject area."
4,Pretty good Hitchcock and I'm glad I saw it,"YOUNG AND INNOCENT was an interesting movie where a writer is accused of murder and attempts sereral daring escapes to find the real murderer and prove his innocence. This movie sort of reminded me of one that I saw but didn't review, MURDER.As the stroy reaches the ending, it gets really ""moody"", and then the real murderer is uncovered in a unique way, so I think you should watch this and see what happens."
5,cooking with seitan,it was what i needed because i am learning how. the book has many easy steps to help me. i am glad i choose this book.
1,Complete garbage glass is almost as thin as paper,"I ordered 2 sets of these and gave one to a friend as a gift. He was making us a couple of cocktails put the lid on the shaker and within the first shake it shattered. My set 3 glasses broke the first use. This is the cheapest quality glass I have ever seen. As soon as you unpack the item and handle a glass it feels like it could break in your hand. The glass at the local dollar store is fine china compared to this junk! I believe in the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" but in this case you dont get anywhere close to getting what you pay for. I only paid $8 with free shipping!"
3,Decorative 8-Piece Set,"I got the 8 piece set; I feel like a lot of reviews for some of the other sets. The glassware does have a few bubbles and imperfections but Amazon was great about sending replacements for any broken glasses. I got my sets for under $8 each set which was worth the cost, but I probably wouldn't pay $20 for them, they're just okay. I wouldn't recommend using them as gifts since they do have a number of imperfections but they're nice as decorative glassware and they have a nice weight to them. I use the big martini glass for either flowers or as a big candy dish."
3,So-So,"The glasses are kind of cool. For the money, it is an interesting purchase. The tray is really cheesy--chipped and not worth using."
2,Good value...,"A lot of glassware for the money...Flaws in glass takes away the quality. Many air bubbles in glass,,,,But.....You won't fret so much if they break when you take into account the purchase price.Amazon is great as they replaced unit having received one with broken glass,,Way to go AMAZON<<<always a five star operation."
2,DON'T BUY THIS SET!!!,"When I ordered this set, I thought it was a great deal. But, the first time we tried to use the ""shaker"", we dropped ice into it and it shattered all over the place. The glasses are nice though, haven't been able to use them yet due to having no shaker. Now we have to spend another $8 we spent on this set, to get a new shaker. Not that big a deal, just be warned...."
4,Great starter set or decor for the price.,"This set is a great starter set for someone looking to enhance their bar area. Or to be used as decoration. Don't expect for it to be a well used set. The glass is very thin and easily breakable. The tray I was a lil dissapointed with. They call it acryllic, I call it plastic. It will make a great piece for your house. My first set arrived broken and used...but of course, Amazon rocks and they replaced the set. You cannot beat Amazon's, Service, Selection & Price. Thus... buy this and your satisfaction will of course be guaranteed. Buy it for $20 or less, your getting a great bargain. Any other price is ""OK.""(speaking of the 8 piece circle martini set)"
2,Looked good at first....,This looked like a great set until my boyfriend tried to make his first martini... the shaker shattered in his hands. i guess thats what you get for buying something cheap...
2,arrived broken,"Nice set, the glass is thin. I havent used it yet, but, wouldnt be surprised if it breaks when we do. One of the glasses arrived with the stem broken completely off. It is DEFINITELY thin glass. Very thin. I would have been VERY mad to have paid more than the $7.50 I did for it."
4,good for what it is!,I ordered this set because I was in need of everyday sort of martini glasses. They are nice looking but made of lightweight glass. They are good for casual entertaining because for $20 who cares if you break them.
1,MArtini Glasses,was very disappointed when the glasses came broken did not even get to enjoy the use of the for the party that they were originally purchased for
3,Smaller that we thought.,"These are great glasses. The tray came a bit chipped on delivery, but it was small enough to keep.They are beautiful glasses that seemed a bit smaller than we had expected.We've yet to use them, but plan to serve dessert in them soon."
3,Glassware Bejeweled 8-Piece Martini Set,"The glass is okay. I don't like the tray that much, not very good."
4,Handle with care,"This item is very nice for the price. It would have received 5 stars, however, the glass is VERY fragile! They are very thin. After the set was used the first time we had 2 of the 4 glasses in tact. They were broken while sitting in the sink. We were just not careful enough when washing them. I would purchase these again even knowing how fragile they are."
2,Not worth it,"These are very thin, very brittle glass. The edge of one of the glasses got a minor chip going into the dishwasher before the first use, so I was very gentle with them, and still the shaker broke the very first time it was used. I'm not known for superstrength, OR for breaking glasses in the kitchen/dining room..."
1,Very flimsy....,We ordered the item twice because first time it came broken. But second time also was the same result. You may like it if the set comes in one piece.
1,UNHAPPY,"THIS ITEM ARRIVED USELESS. I ASKED THE SALERS TO INDICATE WHAT CAN I DO TO GET IT FIXED, BUT NEVER RECEIVED AN ANSWER."
2,Screens wore out quickly,The screens on this product wore out very quickly and are $20 to replace which is almost the cost of the entire product at $35. Everything else seems fine.
3,"Adequate, but not stellar","The stylus/pen fits my Axim x51 and serves it's purpose for me--primarily a stylus, but as a back up pen. The pen skips occasionally but still works. It was fairly pricey, so combined with performance, I've rated it 3 of 5."
2,So Disappointed!!!,"I have loved every Virginia Henley book I have ever read, except this one. I went from appauled to angered to very flustrated. First of all I think it is dangerouse and unrealistic to have, what can only be called RAPE, turn into love between the two main charaters. Especially sence the rape took place when Kitty was just a child and Patrick was a grown man. It really turned my stomach. I have to agree completely with one of the other reviewers who said, it is really hard to like either one of these charaters. If you are thinking of starting to read some of Virginia Henley's work please do not start with this one. All of her other books that I have read have been wonderful."
3,not her best,"I did not feel this was Virginia Henley's best work. Perhaps the fact that is a reprint of an earlier book is the reason her characters aren't as easy to love and the writing is sometimes a bit disjointed? I suggest readers would prefer to read ""Seduced"" first - THAT is a truly sensational read."
1,Not worth a look.,"Enticed is a disappointing read, less a story of romance than a catalogue of sexual perversions. Kitty jumps from one to the next, beginning with her rape at the hands of the man Henley would have us believe is the hero of the piece, through two marriages to other men that make Patrick a sideline character for a significant portion of the book. By the time she finally finds her way back to Patrick again, the book has gone on too long, and neither of the romantic leads have built up enough charisma to make the ending believable or compelling. Skip it."
1,I loved all of the Henley books so far except this one!,"Of the Henley books I've read thus far, this one was by far the worst! I skipped through most of the book, only reading the steamy scences, which weren't as good as they normally are! Save your money!"
2,Not her best,"I love Virginia Henley but these characters are so disconnected and unromantic. There is simply nothing endearing about any of the players in this book, in fact most of all the characters are so flawed and dark I hate to consider it a romance. Definately put this on your ""if there is nothing else to read"" list."
1,insipid,this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain. Read something substantial for a change!
1,An insult to volleyball and cheaply made.,"This dvd is a complete joke,and I believe my single purchase paid for the entire production. I am ashamed that I purchased it. This might be helpful to anyone who has NEVER seen or played volleybal. Furthermore, this product certainly cannot be called ""advanced."" It is so pathetic that I cannot even hand it down to the 12 year-old level coaches. Pay for shipping and you can have my copy!"
5,Great garden flag at a reasonable price.,This just the garden flag I wanted because it is colorful and reasonable price. I live in Florida and my Redskin garden flags must be replaced every year so this is perfect.
4,Great Holster Rides lower than a duty holster,"All in all I like this holster. The fit is perfect for my Springfield TRP half rail, and also for Rock Island 2011 VZ w/ Full Length Rail. The retention is adjustable, and drawing the firearm take some practice, but I am very confident it is secure. I really like drop holsters and with this holster the firearm rides lower than a standard duty holster. I would recommend it."
3,it was ok needed for games to play,it was ok but needed more sims games to play it did not know itbut it was fast cheap and easy to get
5,Watercolor Secrets for Painting Light,The best book on intepreting light for an artist that I have read.... and I have read well over a hundred by now.
3,A good & kinky read.,"This was the first Kinky Friedman book I read, having known of him by reputation for many years. It lived up to all I've heard of his books: fast-paced, quirky humor, a wild cast of characters, a touch hard-boiled. But Dashiel Hammett he's not. As in many mystery novels, the writing in this book, although fun, breaks no new literary ground and is typical for the genre. If you're looking for a good, easy read, you'll certanly enjoy this!"
1,Uranium ??? Please !!,"I thought this was the perfect fit for my nuklear powered car and bought a dozen of this. Little did I realize that the radioactivity would be so low that I can barely run the car and not be able to launch the counter-traffic missiles or the retroguns designed to take down chasing cops.I dont want to get started on the time machine. It malfunctioned just when I had set the year to 2064 (just to see if my girl would be with me till that time). A serious of beeps with warnings of insufficient power and the whole damn machine went up in smokes killing my children and maiming my grandma. The emissions bamaged my drain my face my vital organs and my hair. now i am bald, have effeminate voice, runny nose and an infantile p.e.n.i.s.oh yea. my girl left me.Don't recommend this stuff."
2,Neighbor's Dog Liked it More than I thought...,"I got this product to keep my neighbor's pesky dog out of my goddamned garden!I coated some of my seeds with this stuff before I planted a recent carrot patch. As expected, the dog came and ate all of the carrots. I expected him to get sick or at least no longer enjoy the carrots due to their Uranium nature, but he loved it! He continued to eat the carrots, visibly growing as he ate them. He left my garden at least 6 inches taller and with a spryness I have never seen out of the damn old mutt. I watched this scene from my window with horror and I still am not sure what to do about this. At night I can see a faint green glow coming from the neighbor's doghouse which I assume is a result of my carrot shenanigans.I only gave this product 2 starts because it grew, overnight, the largest carrots I have ever seen. They were 2' long and a vibrant orange that I have never seen before."
2,Disappointed,"My dad is currently going through radiation treatment for Colon Cancer which is fine and all, but he has to drive 45 minutes away for it and is usually too weak to drive afterward so my mom has to tag along as well. Well I bought this a few weeks ago for his BDay and put under their bed hoping it would help cure him. Oh boy was I wrong, now his cancer has spread to other organs and gave my mom Testicular Cancer . I'm sorry but I can't rate this product higher than 2 stars for the Turkey Neck Cancer that it gave to my mom."
2,"Hey, was that supposed to happen?","I though this stuff was supposed to glow in the dark, boy I was disappointed. I am upset because I've been carrying this stuff in my pocket as a good luck stone. My teeth and hair have all fallen out, and my eyes bleed from time to time. The worse was when I went to meet a friend at the airport and set off some alarms and got the snot beat outta me by some TSA goons. Then the FBI took it away from me after questioning me for 4 days! In short, screw this item!"
1,Don't use in a teleportation device!,"I bought this product as the final ingredient for my teleportation device. Well, it worked just fine for powering up the machine, but unfortunately my cat followed my into it during a test run. Now I'm half cat! I would be ok with that, I'm fond enough of cats to be one, but now my wife left me, because, well, fluffy was fixed. I can't see my kids anymore because the judge ruled that someone who jumps out the window regularly to beat up other cats is a bad influence on children. This product has ruined my life!"
3,Works on teeth AND marble headstones.,"I purchased this product after reading reviews saying it whitens teeth. It does, in fact, whiten teeth and they do stay white! I would venture to say that they might have a slight luminescence now. It made my teeth so white, that I thought I would use it to clean the marble where I work. WOW can this product clean marble slabs! Even better than it whitens teeth! I have now cleaned all the headstones in the cemetery where I work. I can now here a bunch of people banging on my office door, probably to thank me for cleaning those headstones. They have become very insistent! They must think I am really smart for using Uranium to clean the headstones, they keep saying ""Braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaains! Braaaaaaaaaaaaaains!""Please sendPoulan Pro PP3516AVX 16-Inch 35cc 2-Cycle Gas-Powered Anti-Vibration Chain SawandFiskars 7884 X27 36-Inch Super Splitting AxeI think they are on Prime...hopefully I can make it until tomorrow."
1,Out Of Stock For Xmas?!,"I've had trouble finding both a Nintendo Wii and Uranium Ore for the kids this Christmas. I would suggest that the manufacturers increase their production for the holidays, as few of us have time to stand in long lines at Best Buy or broker deals with the Chinese Prime Minister."
1,Dont use this as vag cream!,I was hoping to get to warp factor 8 with my girlfriend. Instead she turned into Hulk and tossed me through a wall. Now shes in the park fighting with the National Guard.
3,NOT as seen on TV,"This is a fairly mid-grade Uranium. I don't think I'd purchase generic again. It's just not the same as real thing.Also, bad idea to microwave this kind of Uranium."
4,...and I thought it would be difficult.,"Trapped on in this supreme-being forsaken world with no fuel for my starship, and here I find they distribute fuel for a reasonable price. Only 500 more metric tons and I'm out of here! This world really is odd..."
5,I'm a godmother!!!!! :o),"I gave this as a gift to my friend and her husband who were having a hard time getting pregnant. It worked like a charm!!! They are now proud parents and they've asked me to be the godmother!*anyone know where I can find 1,547 one legged onesies? oh, and the neck hole should be large enough to accomdate two heads."
2,Help! Please help!,"I purchased this uranium ore several week ago, and nowhere on the package did it say anything about not using it as a f flavor enhancer, like salt or paprika, and I'm starting to feel a little funny. Has anyone else had this experience? I'm not sure whether or not I ought to go to the doctor."
3,"Great for vaporizing a small city, not so much for MASS destruction","Nice pendulous mushroom cloud, nice heat flash, good amount of fallout, but if you're looking to take out a major metropolitan area with one clean shot you're going to have to look elsewhere. Many of my comrades have opted for the ANAL DOUCHE SYRINGE"
2,Easier method,"Uranium ore is process intensive. I suggest forgoing this product and buying the yellow cake instead. I understand Iraq has a large quantity for sale, at reasonable prices. Don't tell the USA, they are still looking for it. They will never think to look on Amazon."
4,Amazing!,How did they get this piece of space rock all the way from Uranus? (that planet's name always cracks me up!) Each rock individually numbered as well...mine is number 235...
3,Half-life needs work,"There are other isotopes that have a much better half-life.Product needs more development.I have also discovered that after a spider wandered out of the container and bit me, that I can do whatever a spider can and that I have a preference for redheaded women, just like my gentle Uncle Ben.These side effects should have been noted by the manufacturer."
1,Hidden Corn Syrup Not on the Label,"I mixed this with Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz like chocolate milk and i got a tooth ache. Turns out My teeth were a little loose and almost falling out. Not sure what the correlation is, but I think it has hidden corn syrup. Plus it tastes a little gritty."
4,Permanent hair removal,"I'll never have to pay for one of those painful, overpriced Brazilian waxings again! Just keep this miracle product on you at all times and within days you'll have a sexy clean look without the worry of ingrown hairs or five o'clock shadow. Of course, you'll have to be comfortable with having a bald head and bloody stools."
4,An almost perfect home reactor solution.,"If you are a home reactor enthusiast like I am, you're always on the lookout for a conveniently sized fuel product. Trying buying a can this size through the usual channels! Trying buying more without an international treaty and some sort of sovereign authority! I only wish this Uranium Ore was Amazon Prime."
5,"I can't caution you enough, buy only new, unused uranium ore","The used stuff has a nasty aroma, and sometimes isn't all that hygienic. Well, it really depends on what you want to use it for I suppose..."
3,Clearly not in NEW condition,"I was very excited to receive a new can of Uranium Ore as seeing my previous can was really beginning to show it's age from the frequent and repeated use that I was putting it through.Imagine my surprise when I received this can only to find that it was not in mint condition, a little investigation and tracing of radioactive isotopes in dead spys all over the world lead me to conclude that this Uranium Ore is clearly from an old Soviet Union nuclear reactor."
2,Disappointed,"This is a sample of uranium-238, not the much rarer uranium-235 that I was led to believe after visiting the vendor's website. If you want uranium-235 or uranium-234, you need to look elsewhere. On a side note, Images SI does have other radioactive materials for sale on their website. I was particularly pleased to find some cesium-137. Be warned that it costs more than the uranium however.To the reviewers who talk about making explosive devices using this as fuel -- good luck. You are looking for plutonium-239, not uranium-238. Unless you have a nuclear reactor in your basement, this sample isn't going to be of much help to you."
1,Poodle still can't talk,"I bought this a few days ago as I read a canine training book that said Uranium Ore heightened canine intelligence. Since my family doesn't have a Geiger counter, we figured we'd just be safe if we kept the uranium in an airtight tupperware container with some used pencil lead. I placed the uranium ore under my standard poodle's makeshift bed and left it there for about six months. Lo and behold, our poodle figured out barking at nothing was illogical! Hence, since I saw the success and always wanted to have long, in-depth discussions with my poodle on American policy, I left the ore there for another six months. She now has six arms and still doesn't talk.I would give this .00000000001 star, but that's not possible. What a useless item."
4,Should do the trick...,"Bought this to go with the historically accurate recreation of Los Alamos that a small group of us have been working on over in New Mexico. Eagerly looking forward to finishing off our little gadget as soon as I can get on board a standard airine with it (random bag checks have picked it up twice now, but on the bright side all the airport sniffer dogs have dropped dead).Excellent product at an excellent price!"
3,"I expected to see the ""Customers who bought this also viewed""","to include gas centrifuges. After all, what good is slightly enriched uranium unless you also have a gas centrifuge? Weirdly, however, it appears people interested in the Uranium are also interested in Cheese Wheel (whole). Color me suspicious, but someone who wants insufficiently enriched uranium, doesn't want a gas centrifuge but also wants a cheese wheel, to be a bit scary."
1,Less than satisfying enlargement,"I purchased this product to enhance my physique. Specifically, the nethers. I applied it just as it said on the label, ""rub judiciously to area desired to enlarge"". and I waited. And waited. And waited. The best effect I received was a warm glowing that my girlfriend found unnerving, though illuminating. Overall, this product did not work as well as the pumps or pills that I buy from spam emails. Would not buy this product again unless my Geiger counter needs to be calibrated. which it never does. because i don't own one."
3,Is bad,"You measly Americans... You buy inferior uranium from Internet and expect good quality... You and your technology, it's why you no strong like before... I buy vodka from bar and I get free uranium, in mother Russia you no buy uranium, free uranium comes to you...But I buy this uranium to ""try it out"" and it is very bad... It's very weak and my failed nuclear bomb not even kill me, I instead have four arms, but the ladies love it, if you know what I mean...Sergei, More Vodka!"
1,Not very enrichment friendly,"After ordering 17,897 units of this product I was very disappointed to find I still didn't have enough Uranium for my project.Several of my lead researchers advised me that I would need at least need another 500,000 units to go ahead with my 'final solution.'I was so angry at this news I had four of them beheaded. Now I am left with one clumsy scientist and 17,897 units of low grade Uranium which are of absolutely no use to anyone.Not only that, the Uranium you see sold above is of low grade and I would not recommend it to anyone looking to blow up a small to medium sized country off the Mediterranean sea.If you want my advice, contact the Russians.Since doing so I have never looked back. Allahu Akbar!"
1,Could not create fission! Do not buy!,"Using my training from derpaderpastan, I set out to weaponize this material. The material was of very poor quality, and simply not fissible (that's the technical term for it). I was eventually able to get what I needed on ebay, and I received a great discount on a Uranium + Plutonium bundle. The Ayatollah Qaqamanie is going to be very pleased.p.s.Hello CIA/NSA :-)"
4,My secret flan ingredient,And the secret of my brilliant smile. Useful for many chemistry and physics homeschool experiments. Replaces over 32 AA size batteries. Gets rid of all fleas and tics on household pets. However I'm deducting 1 star because it didn't help with weight loss despite all the product claims.
1,Homeland Security has NO sense of humor.,"I bought this stuff in an effort to jack up the performance of my step through Honda 90. I was tired of getting whooped by mopeds. When the product arrived the UPS guy didn't look familiar and neither did his 3 strip searching, Patriot Act citing buddies. In the future I'll remember not to keep large amounts of fertilizer on hand as well as short pieces of black pipe. I also regret my decision to go for the ZZ Top look. On the more positive side, the weather at Gitmo is great! They don't let us out much, but it never seems to rain here. They do give us some ""monitored"" internet time."
2,Can of cancer,"I got some of this stuff to cover myself with during Halloween. I thought it would be cool to walk around glow in the dark.Instead the day before Christmas I got diagnosed for cancer of everything and I've got [...] less for chemotherapy treatments (great, more radiation) since I can't return this can of death.On a happy note, my wife just found out she was pregnant. I hope our kid doesn't have two heads and ten arms. Well, if the baby does maybe we can send it to India where it will be worshiped as a god."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I ordered this product to do some tests on huma- I mean NON-human subjects, and wouldn't you know, the container broke open mid-shipping. I opened the box it was shipped in and the Uranium flooded my arms and entered my blood stream. I have already grown six new arms, as well as four new legs. You read right, I have fourteen limbs.What was left in the container I used in my experiment, and it FAILED! Now I have to find a burial site.DO NOT BUY!"
1,Worst CD ever,"These guys have really gone downhill in the last fifteen years. I tried several times to play this disc in my CD player, and when it didn't take, only after I wiped off the data side with my TWM t-shirt did I get any sound at all.Man, this band should have stuck with its original sound from 1985."
2,Not Pure Enough of a Sample,"Tried to refine and sell to Osama bin Laden (HA you thought he was dead, didn't you?). He tested it and the purity of the refined metal was a measly 48.773%. Only enough to decimate about 40 square miles."
2,Not enough delivery options,"I bought this stuff to power my Delorian on a trip back to 1955. All went well until I got there. At first I was shocked it had all been used up on one trip but then I thought, ""my bad, it was -50 years I was travelling, I'll just order some more"". I was horrified to discover that they would not deliver to 1955. When I rang the phone number for the company there seemed to be a Chinese Laundry at the other end and they said they had never heard of Amazon and had no Uranium ore. I hate to think what might have happened if I hadn't known that there would be a lightning strike that would provide the 1.21 gigawatts I needed to get home.Good product, poor customer service."
2,Ineffective for promoting vivid dreams,"I bought this product because I heard from my Native American friends that it promotes vivid dreams. I have used it under my pillow for three weeks and no luck so far, though most of my hair has fallen out and my teeth are loose."
1,Nyet!,"I no recommend this product for mad scientist, evil overlord, enemy's of James Bonds or little girls. Is too expensive and too small for building even small nuclear device much less power global death beam. I have brother Pavel that sell three times as much for half price. Come to Minsk and go to ""Lenin's Tomb"" bar in the east side of town, talk to Boris the bartender and tell him the password ""Borscht"", he will let you in basement. Walk to second freezer, inside is Pavel's office. Cash only."
3,Not what I needed,"Since I was unable to get what I needed from the nuclear wessels I bought this as a replacement. Needless to say this did nothing to fix the fractured dilithium crystals. So I lent it to a friend who was trying to replace his Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator well that was a dismal failure, and he was so angry. I then gave it to the crazy scientist down the street for some project he was working on. He said he had better stuff from a unnamed source. Oh well I guess I will just use it to power my killer robot."
3,Great Product but not sold complete,"This is a great product but for any serious application, you must also buy this :Oxo Good Grips Salad SpinnerThis is so you can centrifuge it and increase its applications.Good luck!"
5,A godsend!,"I have been looking for this for years! Finally, the perfect thing to put in the trunk of my '64 Chevy Malibu!"
1,A very substandard fissile material!,"I purchased this product because I wanted to make a 5 megaton bomb to impress my neighbors at our fourth of July barbecue. Unfortunately, when all was said and done, I was embarrassed when the yield was less than 500 kt. No birds on fire, no boiling rivers, nothing.I want my money back!"
1,Looks too much like Skinny & Sweet,"I think this product should be recalled, specifically because it's packaging looks too much like Skinny & Sweet. I mean there's a big radilogical symbol on the side, but I thought that jut meant it tasted really good. I put some in my bosses coffee, and well... he's dead now. luckily I only confided this fact with my friends in the women's room.After checking the stalls first.I mean, I'm not an idiot. I don';t want word of this getting around or anything,Anyway, recall the stuff, make new packaging and I won't have to go stealing bodies from the morgue.Not that... I... stole a body or anything like that."
3,A tasty alternative,"Mixed with a little garlic, some finely chopped basil and pine nuts this makes a fine alternative for pesto. And it has an added advantage which is that if the lighting fails in your home it will produce sufficient illumination to make your kids and pets glow in the dark, enabling you easily to locate them."
2,Not sure what happened,"Three days after receiving this uranium, all seemed well, only now, every day I come home from work, I can't seem to figure out if I have a cat. Weird."
1,Be careful!!!,"I live in Iraq and I purchased this a while ago. Now, I am in Guantanamo Bay and they are using the Uranium I bought here as evidence to convict me of WMD's. Great product but if you are live or are somehow Middle Eastern affiliated, don't buy it. Bush will have you locked up and molested like they did me. Be WARNED!!!"
1,Poor addition to cake mix!,"I thought it would add more Yellow Flavor to myDuncan Hines Classic Yellow Cake Mix. I added six canisters of Uranium Ore but maybe it wasn't enough. My cake just didn't improve. It didn't taste like much but the inside of my mouth & my throat have turned an acidic, bile-y yellow & viscous tendrils of black esophagus have been spewing out when I cough.I would not recommend this product to any stay-at-home moms or 30-minute chefs looking to add a little something to theirSweet 'N Low Yellow Cake MixorWomen's Bean Project Golden Cornbread Mix.As a saffron substitute it certainly saves $$$ but your dinner party guests will know you're a cheapskate! Save yourself from the shame by choosing high-quality spices over cheap imitation Uranium!"
5,Miniature Mushroom Cloud,"After I bought this little can of Uranium, I bought myself a miniature centrifuge off eBay. Before long I had enough critical mass to make a mini nuclear bomb.So then I detonated my little nuke with a Black Cat firecracker in my garage.All of a sudden there was a miniature mushroom cloud spreading radioactive materials all over my garage. So now, every time, I go into my garage, I first have to put on one of those plastic yellow suits and the alien-looking face mask.It was a fun experiment, but one my neighbors complained to the H.O. saying I wasn't zoned for the production and detonation of nuclear materials."
3,needs better packaging,"I have purchased uranium ore from several different vendors and typically they come in led lined containers and larger quantities this Tim container is flimsy and small, the centrifuge then I put this sample in spins well at high speed and I feel my end product will be ready for my cabin retreat in the woods within weeks I recommend this ore dues to the good spin rate and hi radioactive content"
4,Amazing,"GREAT SCOTT!! This product is amazing! But please, whatever you do, DO NOT expose this product to 1.21 Gigawatts. The future of mankind depends on it!"
3,Good to see uranium here..,"First, I'm not sure what the abundance of U-238 is in this sample. In any case, if you want this for ""experimenting,"" note that this is NOT the U-235 that you probably should be looking for. If this sample is pure, even though it's just U-238, it deserves 4 stars. But only 3 for now, since no information is provided here."
1,Did not make my canoe go any faster,"Ungainly shape and small size proved to cause wet hands and canoe actually seemed to go slower. I'm not sure if there's any connection, but there were a lot dead fish floating on the way back. Very bad ore."
5,Fun for the whole family + excellent upgrade for your spudgun,"Not only do all 4 of us college students living here love this stuff (it goes great on pizza, and keeps it piping hot for hours!), our cats have taken a liking to using it as a face-scratcher, and it's done wonders for their coats. Far less dander now, and their glow-in-the-dark tags are even visible during the day!As an added bonus, once you've depleted the entire jar, you can upgrade your spudgun to use depleted uranium rounds! Using high-pressure steel parts instead of PVC is highly recommended if you do this, but the increased range and damage is worth it."
4,Best Uranium Ore I ever bought,"I recently bought this product because I read in an online article that it can help with male enhancement. I grew at least three inches overnight!!! Although, the only setback is that I now have pustules growing out of my eyeballs making it very difficult to see. All in all: worth it."
2,Performance enhancement,"I added some of this to my protein shake to give me MOAR power. I haven't seen any benefits yet, unless you count growing a tail. I mean, don't get me wrong, the tail gives me better balance...but baby, I need power."
1,"Dont buy this product, bad for you","This product bad for you, dont buy, it no work. I will buy all left over to bury away to protect all world."
4,Bush/Cheney brilliant coup,"The Bush administration, with help from Congress, AIPAC, and an ersatz Fourth Estate, has accomplished its mission to freedom-nudge both Afghanistan and Iraq back to the stone age, denying the bad guys the infrastructure and electricity needed to access the internets, with the intention of purchasing large quantities of uranium and bonus free shipping and the added convenience of ""one-click"" check-out that only a quality outfit like Amazon can offer."
5,If you know where to get a ton of this;,"I'll buy it; however, I'll have you ship it to Alaska in care of S. Palin."
2,"Okay, I guess",I didn't buy this from Amazon but the other seller took forever to send it so I'm giving it 1 star.I gave it another star for the frustration free packaging.
4,Actinirriffic!,"This will do wonders for my efforts reloading 30mm anti-tank ammunition.Also, description does not mention that it ships ""wrapped in a special CIA napkin""."
2,Don't buy used.,I purchased this product used and was deeply disappointed with its performance: or utter lack thereof.Don't be cheap: spring for the new stuff or you'll regret buying this item.
3,Do not leave this stuff lying about!,"I had a can of this that I had on a shelf. One day I noticed that the lid was off and a spider was building a web in the can. I tried to smash it, but it crawled up my arm and bit me. Now I keep having these strange feelings that something bad is happening, and an urge to fight crime, climb up walls, and swing from threads."
3,Seconday use saved it.,"When I first recieved this product I was vey excited. I exposed myself immediately and got fitted for tights. However my super powers did not manifest in the promised 2-4 weeks. Instead I got cancer. I was incredibly displeased with this turn of events, and almost requested my money back. The product redeemed itself after I gave it to my annoying neighbor and not only gave HIM cancer, but also mutated his dog into a rampaging monster."
2,Do not buy if seal is broken,"Imagine my dismay when I, much like a wide-eyed little girl on Christmas Day, eagerly unscrewed the cap to my very first container of Uranium Ore only to discover...that it had millipedes crawling around in it. Hundreds of them. And they're all radioactive, so of course they're each about as big as my cat. And with TWICE the legs. No thanks to you, Uranium Ore Inc, I have to knit god knows how many millipede snow booties. I mean...I have to. They're my pets now. They'll probably vomit radioactive bile all over me if I don't appease them.Plus, as soon as I got this thing in the mail, the Libyans were all over me. And I gotta knit snow booties for THEM now."
4,"Finally, a multi-purpose health and beauty aid that works!","For years I've sworn by my Smith's Rosebud Salve - not only for chapped lips, but its other suggested uses as well: diaper rash, rough cuticles, and a skin preparation, among others.But Uranium Ore trumps it. It goes on smoothly and with a minimum of greasy feeling on my skin. Any feeling at all, actually, over time.And I'm still discovering new uses! I wear product in my hair to remedy my thick, dry, thirsty locks and the combination skin of my scalp. Pomades, glosses, gels, serums - I've tried them all.On a whim I dolloped some UO in my hand and ran it through my hair. It worked great! For six days I had incredible hold, shine, shape, and body. Now that my pores sealed permanently due to the chemical burns I no longer struggle to keep up with the hippest hairstyles and I save hundreds of dollars a year on salons. And my bald pate is a rich, shiny, lobster red, which has (unforseen benefits) turned quite a few heads!"
3,Very low CPM count,"Other sites sell pieces with much higher CPM for less than half the cost. I found this out only after I received the shipment. Hopefully the CPM level is high enough to power my flux capacitor, even though it's supposed to have plutonium; but that's not available through Amazon.On a side note, if anyone speaks fluent German, contact me, looking for a partner to help kill Hitler - Should be back in no time!"
1,Yellowcaked--NOT!,"This didn't power up my bomb, me, or anything else around here for that matter. I mean come on!It's radioactive, it's not radioactive, I'm radioactive, you're radioactive.. I don't know, YOU figure it out!"
5,Great For Tomatoes!!!,"In preperation for the upcoming zombie apocalypse I bought this Uranium to give a little extra ""umph"" to the Miracle Grow that I usually spray on my garden. Being able to garden in the middle of the night was an unexpected benefit of this miracle product. The vegetables started to glow beautifully which made them easier to pick, however some of the little buggers do try to bite me while I'm working. I told my neighbor that he was welcome to anything in my garden not realizing how territorial the tomatoes had become. They didn't recognize him and he lost an arm. Fortunately he gained a tentacle in its place so it's all good."
5,Great stuff!,"This saved me a TON of money! My grandma had this huge tumor on the right side of her head. The doctors wanted an insane amount of money to treat it. I bought some of this stuff, made it into a paste with a little water, and rubbed it into the tumor area for a few months. The thing withered and fell off! Fantastic. I only used about half of the tin, too, goes a long way. I gave the rest to neighborhood kids that came by for trick-or-treat. Forget your oncologist...pick up some of this and you should be good to go."
2,Power my spaceship this wouldn't!,"Homesick for planet Dagobah I am. Fuel for my spaceship I need. Bought this product last year I did. (To raise the funds, many years of signing autographs at Geek conferences it took me.) Hundreds of containers I purchased. Melted them I did, fuel rods to make. But, sadly, power my ship they would not. Too low-grade. So for the foreseeable future, stuck here on Earth I remain."
2,"Turtles now teenagers, lack Karate skills","This product doesn't work as well as I would have hoped. I kept three cans in a terrarium with my 4 pet turtles for two years (starting when they were 11). Today, while they are definitely teenagers, they completely lack the following:-Any kind of karate skills-Prounounced valley accent-Tendency to fight crime-Dislike of my paper shredderThere may have been an effect, however, as three of my turtles now seem to enjoy pizza."
1,Peanuts?,"My child has a severe peanut allergy, and I want to know if it is safe to feed Uranium Ore to him. They really should put a label on this stating one way or another. I called the manufacturer, but they acted like I was crazy for even asking. They must not have kids, otherwise they would understand. I mean, even if this Uranium Ore was processed on equipment used to process peanuts, it could be dangerous for my boy. He's very allergic."
4,Please HELP!!!!!!!!,I bought this product about 3 month ago and I could't be more satisfied. But since I stored it in my basement radroaches are appering all around my house and I'm afraid of going into my basement since then.Could anyone come and exterminate these radroaches? 300 bottlecaps reward!!!!!!!!!!!please response quickly!!!!
1,Not amusing comments.,Given the Iranian Islamic Mullahs truly believe God chose them to murder billions of infidels with Uranium 235 warheads in a surreptitious-triggered global thermonuclear war. (Parthians kill one third of human race-Rev 9:18) These uranium comments are a tad bit inappropriate. Don't ya think folks?
1,Deeply disappointed - this is not the love of my life.,"I've never been so disappointed in all my life. I thought this was an advert for a mail order bride from the Ukraine. Imagine my surprise on receiving a cream that makes your testicles glow green in a dark room. I don't see the point in it really. I mean, green testicles? Why? I really must wear my glasses next time I shop on Amazon.If anyone would like to buy this off me, give me a yell. Willing to do a part-exchange for a Ukrainian mail-order bride."
5,"Ex-Prez ""Dubya"" Has Been Searching Forever For This Stuff",Does anyone know his address? I gots to tell him that those WMDs he was searching for over in Iraq was right here on Amazon.com all along!
1,you have dissapointed our gweat leader,"I wecently bought this item to destwoy the wite devil and our brothers from the south. My father died twying to harness the powar of my good fwend Uranium and it's twusted allies plutonium and the very special kwyptonite. We heard that Tony Stark and Cwarke Kent came to attack our gworious countwy, we sent wockets glorious weapons of mass destwuction, we attacked a man called Doctor Jones my son short wound was his twusted ally against our arch nemisis the Thuggee Cuwtist they twied to say that Kim Jong Il was nothing but a panda in a man suit who hated the sardines, we do not hate the sardines we love all fish tuna and the ferwocious tuna fish.

Goodbye my beauties Kim Jong-Un xxx"
2,"Ok ore. I only got a pebl. Thi s ore is barley radioactive and ""cold"" at best","This ore isn't too active. It only has 433 counts a minuate. This a ripoff, double the price you can buy high grade uranium ore off of ebay that emits 130,000 counts This ore is barley radioactive. You can find watch hands more radioactive watch hands insted. [...]/ the ore here is a joke."
4,Truly organic!,"My tomatoes and cucumbers have never had better yields! Best of all, its organic!! I mix a little with the compost every month and amend my garden every 2 months.Funny, though, the deer and opossums have stopped browsing through the garden. I think the 4 foot tall Praying Mantis, and 18 inch wide garden spiders have done their job.Now if I could only get the kids to STOP saddling the tomato horn worms and convice them their NOT beneficial insects.Love this stuff!!"
3,How hip does it get.?,If I could only get this in a gluten-free form it would be a big hit at the co-op. The colors are great for all readings.
1,DOES NOT WORK!!!!,"It doesn't work! When I fit it into my warhead right next to the pulse emitter, It did nothing when I hit the button! If you need High quality stuff for use in the south, do not buy this. I would recommend the good ol' fashioned C-4 and a few spec ops for your demo-needs."
3,Mislabeled.,"The container said it was ""Uranium Ore"" but when I opened it, it was clearly Plutonium. I still used it, but I was severely disappointed."
2,"""Frustration Free"" packaging is anything but","I don't know why Amazon chose to package it using their standard cardboard boxes. I never even received this package, but what I DID receive was several FBI agents knocking on my door wondering why the UPS driver died half way to my house. I thought UPS outfits protected them from this sort of thing? More importantly, I never got my package. Which is a shame, I ordered some nice looking bottled water with it that is apparently from some fresh springs in northern Canada. Guess the UPS people will be drinking THAT, too. Two stars because the bottle looks nice. I might see if the feds will give it to me so I can put some scented candles in there or something. My UPS driver always said to look on the bright side of life, so I guess I will. Rest his soul."
2,Buy the Enriched Version,"I run a secret nuclear facility for a country that would prefer to go nameless. Imagine our surprise when we got our Uranium into the lab and realized it wasnt't the ENRICHED uranium. Sure, this stuff is good for an acetate or practical jokes, but if you need to make some high grade plutonium you better look elsewhere. I'd like to say this products poor review does not refect upon Amazon at all. With the sactions in full effect [...] is about the only way for us to get our materials into the country. Their delivery to the desert is top notch.Oh and... Death to America."
2,Very Bad Customer Service,"I ordered 6 of these to make a bomb so that I could blackmail humanity for $1,000,000,000. It arrived no problem. However, I called the customer service number to find out how I could have it refined and enriched and they told me they only sold the ore. I asked if they had any suggestions at all, and the girl snaps, ""Try Iran!"" Are you kidding me? The cheapest flight is like $3000 round trip! You can bet I'll buy my Uranium Ore from a more customer service oriented company next time."
2,YOU CALL THIS ORE???!!!???,"I had high expectations for this product, as overall, I have been very satisfied with the variety of products I've purchased on Amazon in the past. Thus my disapointment with this one.First off, my kids say it has a ""chalky"" aftertaste (whatever that means - kids!!!). Add to that, it really doesn't appear to soothe ANYTHING on a baby as far as I can tell, and most frustratingly, well, all I can say is that compared to other animal feeds, this produces the toughest veal that I have ever eaten, bar none, when it's not fighting your fork.And I've noticd anothere curous thing, wen I am hloding the jar rel close toom my hed it mars me a little bi woozy buthet ljpopoo ';oo81.dbsio k"
4,"Awesome, killer product","Fantastic, does exactly what it says on the tin. One star off because I can't drive faster than 87 MPH now."
1,"Watch out, product contains filler","I bought this product some years ago and didn't open it until today, ONLY TO DISCOVER that Amazon had replaced half of it with Lead-206. Unlike the other reviewer who lost half of his Uranium completely, I had the same mass that I ordered, only half of it had been replaced with Lead-206, Bismuth, Radium, Thallium and a few others.This is unacceptable customer service Amazon."
3,Ode to Uranium Ore,"I had purchased uranium oreI regret that I didn't buy moreI had only mutated halfwayWhen the cia took me awayWonderful, marvelous uranium oreIt murdered the cat and it burned through the floorBut alas, as I was poor-fatedI ran out before I was mutatedNow my left side is green, droopy, hairy and I lookLike part stroke victim part stephen king bookThis is my ode to uranium oreI loved thee yet I needed some more.PS fyi the shipping costs are a liiiittle bit pricey. Might want to think of adjusting it, just a hair."
3,Passed by Prime (Klaproth's Limerick),"There once was a man named KlaprothWho cooked up some pitchblende-y brothThis bright German fellowMixed cake that was yellowAnd found something new in the frothHe'd already discovered TitaniumBecause of the size of his craniumSo not wanting to strain usHe thought of UranusAnd called his new product ""Uranium""Now Amazon's got it in stockI'll admit that one came as a shockAn ore in a tinRadioactive withinWith a four-million year ticking clockI just noticed while writing this rhymeThat this product ain't covered by PrimeThough small, it's got weightSo you'll pay lots for freightAnd spending that much is a crimeSo although I'd have wanted much moreThan this tiny container of oreI'll have to make doWith one U 92For my Geiger device checking choreBut if science is your main ambitionSince Amazon gives you permissionPlease cover your a$$If you want to tint glassAnd you can't tell your fusion from fissionAmanda Richards, December 12, 2007"
2,Doesn't work too well.,"Grinding this stuff for hours only took my mining from 360-362. Total BS. Needs moar ore. Oh well, at least it's not as bad as the grinding I went through with Herbalism.Also, my gnome grew three inches and an extra pinky finger. Is this normal? I'm going to contact the manufacturer."
1,Never arrived!,"What a total ripoff! I ordered this 2 weeks ago and the postman never delived it. (In fact I think he quit because we have a new postman now.) If you order this make sure you choose the ""extra special handling"" shipping option."
1,Doesn't work,This doesn't work at all. It came early thank goodness but after I ate the whole jar I was still constipated. The only thing it did was make my pee glow in the dark. What a rip-off!
4,AND...now I'm a mutant!,"So I ordered this Uranium ore sample, in order to test my new geiger counter. Everything was going fine...until lasers started shooting out of my eyes. This was a horrible thing for me to go through. I burned down my house, my car, and my little dog Fluffy! Luckily, I had a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses that stopped my eyes from being beams of lasery death. I didn't know what to do! Then I heard someone calling to me (IN my Mind!). They said they could keep me safe, and help me harness my new ability. I went to where the voice kept calling me. Much to my surprise, it was a bunch of other people just like me, who bought this ore sample. They called themselves mutants and the voice that was calling me was a man in a wheelchair called Professor X. He was one of the first customers of this product. I was going to rate this ore a one star, but with my new found powers and a bunch of really cool friends. This Mutant gave it five stars!"
1,Tastes terrible!,"I've never heard of a Uranium flavored Oreo, but thought I would give it try. Based on the taste alone, this stuff is not worth it."
3,Warning: This is NOT chewing tobacco!,"I feel kinda bad giving this 3 Stars because it might be partially my fault but I thought this was Skoal when I ordered it, and from a purely chewing tobacco perspective it was quite poor. Made my mouth feel all ookie, and it burned a hole through my spittoon. (The missus was ticked off, right into the new carpet!)My bad, I guess. But in my defense, nowhere on the package does it say ""This is not Skoal!"" I keep meaning to return it, but I been tired... so very tired, can barely get out of bed. Oh, and now my kidneys are failing too, so I guess this fake Skoal is really the least of my problems."
5,Diva Mexican,This album is awsome. Im very gald i bought it. I recommend this cd to the whole world.
1,I hope this is tongue in cheek,"Is it hate speech to call someone who teaches falsehood a liar? Should nothing be said about the false claims of Jack T Chick? He supposedly hasn't granted a public interview in approximately 30 years. Is he alive? Is he real? The level of anti-Catholicism is virtually unparalleled. And as a Catholic (by the way, Catholic is Christian, and to be less is to be less than the Body of Christ), I am offended that he makes false statements and hides behind comics. Despite this, I will pray for those behind these falsehoods. God bless."
4,An in-depth look into this subject,"Even if you don't agree with Chick's religious outlook (or his way of promoting it) this is an excellent sourcebook for the study of his tracts, booklets which it seems we have all seen at one time or another. These tracts take on Mormons, Catholics, homosexuals, Muslims, liberals, Satanists... you name it! This books provides ""reviews"" of the tracts, some example illustrations, talks about variations in various booklets, some of which have been in print for 40 years. Whether your a fan of Chick's views or are just interested in this medium this is an excellent book."
4,Fun Film,"Great Synatra score! Funny premise played very well by the versatile Gibson. Hunt is not my favorite actress, but she holds her own as a powerful businesswoman without falling into any of the stereotypes normally associated with such rolls. Ashley Johnson puts in a good turn as Gibson's 15 year old daughter, I look forward to seeing more of her in the future."
3,I still don't know what women want.,"I went to watch this movie with some friends of mine. In the middle of the movie, one of my friends whispered,""This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen."" At the end of the movie he said,""That movie was horrible."" What starts of as an ingenious comedy, slowly transforms into a slow typical love story. Now love stories can be really good, if they are subtle and do not resort to cliches and standard plot elements. This movie makes it's point by smacking you, rather than caressing. I would still rent this movie, because the funnier half of the movie is memorable. The latter may actually be touching to those who enjoy the genre.The ending is a bit dissapointing, and the funny gun runs out of ammunition before the movie is half over."
1,Who writes these things???,"DREK... absolute, pure drek. Offensive in its man-only-thinks-of-sex premise, even more offensive that Mel Gibson, like so many aging actors, is paired with ever-younger female costars. That studios still pay actors like Gibson to make such drek, and that those studios pay screenwriters to write it, and that people go see the movie in the theater and then buy the dvd, is as great a mystery to me as any."
2,Boring!,"This movie was just boring. The only funny parts were in the commercials. The movie was also so predictable, that even before I watched it I knew what was going to happen."
3,Predictable fare marginally redeemed by strong performancess,"Given the basic outline of the premise of this story - a misogynistic ad executive (Mel Gibson) who loses a promotion to a successful woman (Helen Hunt) is magically able to read women's thoughts - you can pretty much guess the rest of the plot, scene by scene. Gibson and Hunt both give engaging performances, but it isn't enough to overcome the total predictability of the storyline. Despite the ""high concept"" premise, this is stale ground. Sometimes, however, you just want to relax with a simple romantic comedy, and this movie will fill the bill."
2,What Women Want,"This movie sounded really great and original, but at most times, it just feels like you're wasting your time. You hardly get any laughs (just one), and the so little parts which are meant to make you llaugh are just way too overdone and boring. I don't really recommend this moviealthough it sounds really promising."
3,WHAT WE WANTED,"THIS MOVIE WAS A BIT DISSAPOINTING. NOT THE MEL GIBSON MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE I EXPECT. MAYBE IT NEEDED SOME HOMER SIMPSON INPUT. A FEW BANGS HERE AND THERE, SORT OF, NOT REALLY. LACKED A REALLY GOOD PLOT. MAYBE MEL SHOULD HAVE HAD HIS MIND READING MAGIC GOING WHEN THE WRITERS WERE PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. IT WAS NOT A BAD MOVIE, OVERALL. MIGHT WATCH AGAIN WHEN IT COMES TO CABLE."
3,its ok - a few continuity errors,"1) when he thinks he has cured himself ---by ridding himself of the ability to hear womens thouhgts...he is standing in a stores cosmetic area---notice the floor beneath him---all white tile---- two seconds later---wide angle shot---floor suddenly gets a pattern..near end of movie he goes to apartment of helen hunt, rings the bell / intercom system ---note the number of buttons and the lighting fixtures...change from 4 buttons to 2....and the fixtures are different as well---its a decent story tho--but i always notice these things...drives me nuts"
2,One of the worse by Mel Gibson,"Helen Hunt was her usual self - acted well, portrayed a good character and was beautiful. Mel Gibson, as much as I looked forward to seeing him in the movie, was uncomfortably ""gay-like"" - and by all means I have nothing against gay people but he wasn't trying to act like one in this movie, he was trying to be a hot shot women's man. He just couldn't act it. Somehow Mel is not good acting funny in that way. Storyline was so-so. I would say rent it if you're curious about the movie, but don't bother buying."
2,"Dissapointment,","Mel Gibson should choose better scripts to do. First the Patriot, now this... And testicular cancer is relevant, depending on the temperature of female conversations. You can see it, but dont go with high expectations."
2,Spoiled by the end,"This started out as a descent movie. As other reviews state, it is a fun watch. Fun that is, until my wife asked me what I thought the message was going to be. When the end came, the message was clear: Women cannot do wrong. Just look at what they think (all thinking pretty much the exact same). Men (shown with Gibson's character) cannot do right. This movie was a fun movie, but much too 1-dimensional to need such a strong, Hollywood cliche message (those are for the 2-dimensional movies). Lose the agenda and it would have been a good movie right up until the end."
3,Would You Consider This A Chick Flick?,"This movie can't truly be called a chick flick because the main character (Mel Gibson) was considered a man's man. In most chick flicks it's too mushy, but this movie, if a guy wanted to watch a movie with a chick, he could actually watch it and not feel any less of a man. I recommend this as a date movie. Feel free to rent it and watch it with your lady.This actually reminds me of an ebook that's floating around called the masculine confident man. This character exuded it and it added to his charm with men and women.[...]"
1,Don't bother,This is the worst film I have seen for at least 3 years I was so bored at the end of this I thought I had died and gone to hell. my advice is if you want a bonfire buy this film otherwise avoid it
1,"Interesting Idea, Terrible Movie","As a romantic comedy addict, I expected a lot from this movie. The original idea was very interesting and could have made an excellent comedy about women and emotions. MISTAKE! this is one of the worst film i ever seen in my whole life and without a doubt the most predictable and boring piece of garbage. The acting is terrible: Mel Gibson is Over-The-Top and horrendous.You can't believe him one second. I was ashamed for him. Then, we got Helen Hunt (the worst actress in history): To say that this girl can't act is an understatement. She made me sick. One-dimensional and absolutly horrible performance. The only good points are the solid performance from Marisa Tomei and the enjoyable Bette midler guest appearence but they just can't save the film. Avoid this movie at all cost: It's just too BAD. A waste of time, efforts and movie reels. 2 hours of my life i'll never get back. If you enjoy romantic comedies, check out ""Chocolat"" or ""You've Got Mail""."
1,What I want...an end to mel gibson movies!,"Yes I am reviewing another Mel Gibson movie,and yes,it's not worth the silicon it's recorded on!Every once in a while a film will come out that really will make you want to hunt down the cast,crew and backers,and inflict pain on them.This is such a film!Truely awful from beginning to end,if you really must buy this,don't watch it,just use it as a coaster or something,for your own sanity!"
1,This movie deserves to burn!,"Mel Gibson gets hit by lightning three times and doesn't die? What type of script is this? Who's supposed to believe this tripe? Helen Hunt looks like an overgrown owl and any man in Mel Gibson's place would use his powers for the good of sex instead of throwing it all away. Also, when he says he's gay, I truly believed him because JUST LOOK AT HIM!!!! This was obviously a chick flick and every man's nightmare and I'd watch out because I know who the writers are. BEWARE."
4,Will Have You Dancing,"I loved this movie, not just because I'm a Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson fan, but because it just thrilled me! The great band music, Frank and Dean and Sammy Davis - the sound track is just great. On top of that the dialogue is witty and smart. The love story evolves at the right pace, with the proper hurdles along the way. The first time I watched it I wasn't sure how the main characters nearly came crashing down, but that just inspired me to watch it again! and again! and again!"
4,I like it. I love it! I want some more of it!!,"Yeah, give it to me, baby. Give me some more! What a tasty little movie!Now, let me be serious. This movie is delicious! Gibson and Hunt are both terrific. Have you seen Braveheart? Well, that movie is only good because of Mel Gibson. What Women Want is good and funny for the same reason. Maybe Helen Hunt had a little to do with that, but Gibson alone is sufficient for a movie's goodness and funniness. Basically, Gibson and hunt made this movie work; the screenwriter and director and everyone other than Gibson and Hunt had nothing to do with it."
4,Female empowerment with a love story,"This movie was wonderful. It made me laugh, cry, and filled my heart with love. This is definatly a chick-flick kind of movie, so if you're not into those you probably won't like this movie very much. Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in the movie. He has so really hilarious scenes throughout What Women Want. Another thing I really liked about the movie was the main female characters portrayal. She was a highly successful women in the corprate world. She shows real independence as a person, she's a really strong character. Her character gives off a women power feel. This is yet another reason this movie is so good. It is empowers you to be a women. I would highly recommend this movie to any female."
4,Mel Gibson at his best!,"The subject matter of this film will generally be hated by men and loved by women. (Just read the reviews if you don't believe me) Subject matter aside, the acting was superb! I imagine Mel Gibson had a great time doing this film. He expressed just about every imaginable emotion all in two hours. It takes a great actor to combine comedy and seriousness successfully, which I believe he did. This movie may not be a ""classic"", but if you just want a few laughs, I definately recommend it."
4,Good Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is part serious, and part funny. I believe that the movie really does give men an insight as to what women really want, but does it in a humorous way, making the movie enjoyable to watch. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Distaff.,"Rather pretentious comedy featuring Mel Gibson, who, despite all the emasculation, is in bumpy, toothy, silly-little-boy mode. What women want, indeed! He's a Don Juan in the advertising world, who gets zapped by his blow-dryer while drinking some interesting-looking Cabernet. The result? He's given the ability to read women's thoughts. This is distressing, at first. Regressive, too: according to the writers (all women), these Turn-Of-The-Millennium-I'm-Every-Woman women primarily want to feast their eyes on Mel's tooshy. Hear me ROAR! Well, our hero soon learns to use his newfound Superpowers for his own profit, but then . . . ah, but then, the movie suddenly gets very serious. Most of the second act is dull. The movie finally wears out its welcome starting with about the last 15 minutes. Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend . . . which is REALLY What Women Want! (Kidding, kidding -- sheesh)"
2,A slight twist on a cliched genre,"""What Women Want"" is merely a slight twist on the cliched genre of romance-comedy, adding in the unique aspect of Mel's ability to hear women's thoughts. This idea had enormous potential, and potential to be funny. But this was not the case.A few cute jokes, a strange scene of Mel dancing in the bathroom in pantyhouse and lipstick, and the obligatory cheesy make up with his daughter at the end of the movie after a rocky relationship. We all saw it coming.It's a good date movie, but little else."
1,Dumb movie -- don't waste your money,"I'm not even going to spend much time writing this review because this movie is not worth my time. But anyway, the movie had a few cute moments, but other than that, neither my fiance or I enjoyed watching it. We didn't even finish it before deciding to sell it off. Definately not recommended. If you really feel the urge to watch it, rent it first."
1,A total flop,"I'm sorry but I think Mel Gibson is much too old for the character of this role. I thought the story line relied too much on crude humour, obviously Hollywood doesn't think that people can enjoy a movie without a little naughty stuff in their movies.Well their wrong, I didn't enjoy this movie because of the objectionable and disgusting crude humour,etc.. I thought that it was silly, and shallow, and definately this is not Mel Gibson's best. He's much too old for this part.I don't know what Hollywood wants women to think they want, but I know that I was sorry to have wasted my time watching it. His character is manipulative, and disgusting. I don't understand how the director, could glamourize this. It has too many offensive things for me to like it.I think that the romance storyline was ridiculous and silly."
4,Homage to 'ol blue eyes via Mel Gibson,"This is a fun and cute movie that made me laugh at his male angsts. If only my husband could read my mind right now he'd stop playing video games and.... anyways, my favorite part is where Mel dances around to Frank with the coat rack. Why doesn't Mel, beautiful blue eyes, do more comedies????"
4,Cute Movie and that's all!,"Yesterday I went to the cinema with my 2 friends to see that movie at first I wanted to see the movie ""save the last dance"" but my friend told me her sister saw it and it ,,,wasnt very good, so I went to see with them that movie after seeing the preview for it and it seemed funny.This movie is cute Mel Gibson really did a great job as the chvnistic man with alot of charm and Helen Hunt also did a great job but this movie wasn't excellent it was cute but 2 long so if ur a fan of cute romance comdies go see it"
3,Funny and Frivolous,"A one-joke movie, but in the hands of Mel Gibson, a very enjoyable joke. Mel gets the power to read women's minds, and uses it to romantically pursue and professionally undermine the perky-as-usual Helen Hunt. Pure entertaining fluff."
4,Fabulous!,"Okay, I admit it, I bought this just because it had Mel Gibson in it. But it was great! I thought the plot was totally orginial, no one has done anything like it. And it was funny without trying to hard and it had drama without making you weepy. I really enjoyed it. Just to brief you, it is about a guy named Nick Marshall who is in advertising. He is a real ladies man. Then one day he gets an electric shock after falling in the bath tub with a blow dryer and the morning after he discovers that he can read women's thoughts. I highly recommeded this. Its a very good date movie."
2,Almost a must-rent (hint: don't bother buying),"I'm neutral to Mel Gibson. He's getting old. The movie wasn't acted all that great, but it did have some humor. It's almost a must-rent, but not quite. I wish I'd rented something else, but at least now I can say I've seen the movie, and that I'm truly traumatized by seeing Mel Gibson dressed up like a woman. *shudder*"
2,Boring,"This was boring after about twenty minutes. After the boredom came self-reproach, for having thought that this idea could be properly exploited by fairly talentless writers like these.It's about the level of an average ""Friends"" episode, which I'll admit would make it funny enough for some."
4,Great flick...,"Hey, wow! What a great surprise this movie was. I got this movie for my wife, expecting it to be a total and complete romance with little to nothing in it for me. I was laughing my head off for the first hour. It wasn't until the last twenty plus minutes that it got overly emotional and even then it wasn't too bad. Only thing is, I am not sure if my wife likes it as much as I do. I got an A+ for the effort though. I definitely recommend this movie for some laughs. The emotional ending didn't produce any tears though. As for the type of movie, it reminds me of As Good as it Gets, but with no Oscar potential."
3,Rent don't buy,"This is a definite ""chick flick"" as my husband calls it. As previous reviewers mention, the start was slow, the middle funny, and the ending was disappointing. Would be a fun movie to watch with friends of the female persuasion. Don't force your guy buddies to watch."
2,rent if you're bored and have seen everything else,"The premise of this movie is very good - Mel Gibson, after a freak accident, can ""hear"" what women are thinking. However, the director should have given a little thought to what men want.Mel can read the thoughts of all women and the woman he choses is....HELEN HUNT? Not to bash Helen Hunt too much, but she is neither a particularly good actress nor particularly attractive. Her popularity in Hollywood can only be explained by one thing - she seems to be the only actress who can play a neurotic woman. And that wasn't called for in this flick.Let's see: the characters in the movie have no depth, the ending is quite frankly pathetic; the movie is entirely too long and unfortunately feels predictable. If you buy this movie before seeing it first, you are a fool."
1,Highly Inept,"In Mel Gibson's latest vehicle--and I use the term in all seriousness; his films are like beautiful, empty cars that he somehow manages to power with his charisma--he plays a womanizing cad with a lot of charm and no manners. He's involved in a highly implausible freak accident involving a lightning bolt and a hair dryer which allows him to hear what women are thinking. He learns to be more accepting and eventually develops something akin to human empathy. And, heaven help us, there is even a cameo by Bette Midler. It's a great date movie; it's light and fluffy, like popcorn or cotton, and there's some funny business with Mel as he does funny woman things, like waxing his legs and trying on pantyhose. The soundtrack is so uninspired that, frankly, it finds itself right at home."
3,Rent before you buy ......,It was a funny movie up intil the end then it lost it.My husband and I were cracking up all through the movie then about what felt like a half an hour but was more like 10 minutes. This was the point where I said Nope not buying this one. The movie just fell apart.But the CD looks good.
3,Disappointed,"I wanted to like this movie - after all Helen Hunt is in it. But the chemistry between Hunt and Gibson just wasn't there. gibson couldn't pull off the change from a womanizer to an understanding man in two and a half hours. The writers couldn't make me believe that the Hunt character would ever fall for the Gibson character. What saved this movie from total failure was the concept that Gibson could hear the thoughts of women (not read them, but hear them) - and it was those thoughts that made the movie funny - at least in the beginning of the movie."
2,Depressing!!,"It's a comedy, but you won't laugh. I was very depressed when I watched this movie, the idea was wonderful but the story [was bad], the performance also is so stupid, if you watch Helen Hunt you will be confused weather you are watching Mad About You, As Good as it Gets or even Twister!!In briefe, if you are getting this movie, don't expect much!!"
3,A bit contrived but the actors make it work,"If you enjoy Mel Gibson, and can appreciate Helen Hunt, this could be enjoyable, light entertainment. I enjoyed it, but was disappointed because, with a little work, it could have been fabulous. The plot took a long time to really start, some of the humor was cliche, some of the ""women's viewpoints"" were over-generalized, and the main character's ""change of viewpoint"" was a bit overkill. However, watching Mel and Helen act together made it work for me - the on-screen chemistry was there, and the overall movie intent came across as genuine.Enjoy with popcorn and your girlfriends!"
5,What Women Want - DVD,Arrived in the condition I had hoped it would. A very entertaining movie. Very well made. Great acting. One of my favorites.
2,Duck and Cover,"Duck and Cover, Take the Money and Run, etc are some of the phrases that come to mind when I think of how I would describe this movie. No, more correctly these are phrases that would describe why Mel Gibson would ever make a movie like this. They had to drag me to the theatre in the first place to see this film. Luckily I needed no such assistance when the film ended. Seriously, this is a very forced comedy and not a very good one."
5,Mel Gibson the female mind reader.,In this story Mel Gibsons character is in advertising and a single dad who winds up with a new female boss along the way he has a mishap at home when he wakes up he can hear womens thoughts which in the long run gives him a great advantage. Overall great story line makes me wish i could read womens thoughts.
2,This movie sucks,"I thought this movie would be soo funny, but its not. Its not even funny at all. I laughed like once or twice, that's it . The same cheesy love sick movie that we see all the time, only this one has a horrible story plot to it."
3,Eh.,"This movie started out to kind of funny, and really interesting... But nearing the end it kind of got boring and relentless. If I were one of you, I would rent the movie. ...."
3,don't take this too seriously!!,"This is a cute story, and to those of you contemplating renting it -- if you really like Mel, go for it. He is funny and very cute. while his character is hardly a gentleman, by the end of this fil he is a different person. i thought that he & helen hunt had a great chemistry together despite what other reviewers here thought. Rent for a light romance/comedy night<"
2,predictable,"predictable hollywood flick. not horrible if you've just eaten too much, it's 1 in the morning, and you need something to zone out with. aside from that scenario, not worth the time."
2,What Women Don't Want!,"What Women Want was a smash hit when it was released but this romantic comedy is unfunny and way too long. Mel Gibson gives another solid performance but I just couldn't relate to this film and I am a woman! Helen Hunt was so over-rated when this film was making millions of dollars at the box office but jeez you never hear anything about her anymore, her ship has sailed. This is a movie you rent or borrow from a friend, not worth purchasing!"
4,Good Film!,"I enjoyed this one. The acting was good, and the music was astounding. This is a classy film... and one I have now seen several times. (It doesn't seem to get old as quickly as some others.) Gibson plays a ""man's man"" bent on sleeping with many, many women. He changes into a much more sensitive figure as the movie progresses. It is astounding that all of the women in his life think in complete, coherent, and honest thoughts. That one problem aside, this movie kept me very entertained.Gibson did a terrific job, as did Helen Hunt (about whom I am not very fond, usually). Rent this one if you haven't seen it yet!"
2,the end does not justify the means,"I found that most of the good parts of the movie to be in the trailer, but isn't that the way of movies today? In all honesty, the movie was okay. It had it's cute moments but when the entire package doesn't deliver and I go away unsatisfied I can't in good conscious recommend a movie. For me the end negated anything that was good about the movie."
2,I hope not.,"Rather pretentious comedy featuring Mel Gibson, who, despite all the emasculation, is in bumpy, toothy, silly-little-boy mode. What women want, indeed! He's a Don Juan in the advertising world, who gets zapped by his blow-dryer while drinking some interesting-looking Cabernet. The result? He's given the ability to read women's thoughts. This is distressing, at first. Regressive, too: according to the writers (all women), these Turn-Of-The-Millennium-I'm-Every-Woman women primarily want to feast their eyes on Mel's tooshy.

1,"Great premise, bad movie","What a great premise. Mel Gibson, a male chauvanist of the worst order, can hear what women think. The previews looked like the movie was going to be a great comedy. If you're looking for comedy, though, just watch the previews. All of the funny parts are in the previews, and the movie turns into a romantic drama about Mel Gibson's character reforming and seeking better relationships with his daughter and boss. This had all the makings of a truly fun comedy, and there are great actors in this movie, but it just doesn't satisfy. Perhaps if I had known going in that this movie was a drama, I would have appreciated it more, but this is a movie in search of a theme. Also, Mel Gibson's character is hard to like as he first is a chauvanist, then uses his gift to manipulate people, then finally reforms. By the time he's turned things around, it's too late to turn this movie around. Definately one that I would skip."
2,Hmmm...,Enjoyable but rent it first or buy on sale or second. It is fun but not sure if it is worth full price.
4,Solid Movie,"I Have looked at the movie reveiws some people have made about this movie. I thought this movie was a solid movie. The movie gave men hope of what women really want, but by no means the answers. I think this movie tought me to listen a little more to women. I think one of the best parts is when Mel is going to try and save the day. Thisgs blow up and his face, and HH is the one that saves him. I think it makes women realize that men like to be saved as well. I think it's a good learning film for both men and women. I though Mel did an excellent job. Go and buy this movie, because I am going to."
2,Acoustic Samurai,"I love the idea of an unplugged paul gilbert. It was great, but we listen to gilbert for more his guitar playing, not his singing."
4,Blood and Honor,"I enjoyed this book. I think people of all ages would enjoy BLOOD AND HONOR. It is about the hardships that young boy went through. He was a Christian and a Nazi, which created a conflict. All of his friends were Nazis and they were taught to hate Christianity. Some parts at the end were disturbing but other than those few parts it was a good book. Of course if you want to find out the ending you will have to read it for yourself."
4,Musique mix 2006.,"This is a basic mix of Daft Punk. Over the years... if you've heard it, but never owned one, this is a great starter CD into a new world. I recommend watching ""Interstella 5555"" this will explain everything. Its on youtube. then buy them all as you fall in LOVE.. other then that- there's a lot of the same songs here as on all the other cds combined."
3,This is a cheapy boat,This boat is not cool it kinda goes fast but then when the battery become dead you got to go to the store and buy more thats why I retured mine. so before buying this one buy the ''SEA RAY''(...) because it brings a battery pack which you can charge the battery and don`t have to buy any more batterys.''CHEAPY''
4,My review of the Radio Controlled Sea Hawk Speed Boat,"This boat is a great boat for amateur r/c enthusiasts, but it is not too durable...I had purchased it and within 2 weeks i began to have problems with it. The overall size and style of the boat is great but its speed is not really anything to brag about.. I pesonally feel that it is a great boat dispite it's few faults. i highly recomend that you purchase this product.Owen W."
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I realized from the title this was not a how to poker book but figured it would be something along the lines of anthony holdens book big deal but i was very disappointed with this book.It cover the authors poker games with his buddies in some off the wall home games (granted i am slanted more towards holdem)Other chapters dealing with a poker cruise and his dealings with a woman poker player hitting him up for advice,a chapter about internet poker dealing with a lot of rules and regs dealing with them in the USA.Also has a chapter about books dealing with gambling mostly by Dostoyevsky.On the back of the book it talks about the author being in the world series of poker and i was hoping it would have a little more to do with that but it had maybe three or four pages dealing with this.This was one of those books i keep reading hoping it would get better i felt it never did if you have not red anthony holden's book big deal try that one i could not recommend this book"
4,Wild Animal Baby: Flying Whales & Other Stories,This is the fourth title in the Wild Animal Baby series that I've purchased for this library. Little ones can learn about nature (National Wildlife Federation produces these) and have fun at the same time!
2,"Too much ""Tour"" in this Brian Wilson DVD.","This DVD takes what was really a wonderful tour and hatchets it up into so many pieces the viewer is never allowed to sit back and enjoy a concert. Every song is followed with 3-5 minutes of hijinx, fawning celebrity interviews, or spaced out ramblings from Brian himself. To make matters worse, the song selection features just about every number Brian covered that was originally sung by Mike Love, ignoring many of the gems Brian performed that he actually originated as lead vocalist. If you saw this tour, this mess of a DVD is a real disapointment."
3,"Poor form, poor instruction",I would not recommend this to anyone; particularly a beginner because their foundation training would be flawed. Usually the idiot books are quite good but not this one. The guide on the DVD has very bad form and should not be instructing. Avoid this one. To be safe and develop good form try any of Lee Holdens DVD's; he is a very good instructor.
1,Not worth the time,"I read this hoping for an insight, I got very little from it.There are better books with more information at a basic level in less pages."
5,T'ai Chi Forms Grand Champion & Team USA Martial Arts Coach,"The T'ai Chi Forms Grand Champion (Sifu Hong Yijiao) & Team USA Martial Arts Coach (Michael Steward, Sr.) captured the essence of this book. In their excellant ratings below.It paints a vision and explains T'ai Chi & Qigong using Western science and cultural concepts. As a San Francisco teacher wrote, ""it brings Qigong to the people, as Apple did with the computer.""The medical research and modern terminology are effective reference tools for T'ai Chi & Qigong teachers as well as their students."
2,Self-advertisement,"When purchasing this book/dvd combination, I was hoping to get an introduction to Tai Chi that I could practically evaluate and practice. Instead, what I received was a poorly veiled advertisement for the author's 4 DVD set of instructional videos.While the book does contain certain valuable facts about Tai Chi (history, etc), this is not something that you can pick up and begin doing Tai Chi exercises within an hour. The DVD on the other hand is almost completely useless and while advertising the full length 4 DVD set - looks as if it were filmed in the author's living room with long curtains hiding his sofa.I would not recommend this product. Two stars b/c the book isn't all that bad - but is not a practical application of Tai Chi - and that may have been my mistake."
5,Looking to get into Tai Chi? This is THE BOOK for you!,"Stress at work. Find yourself sitting in front of the television all weekend. Turning into a zombie? Been there, done that.Let me clarify this: I've never been 'up' on the Eastern arts, and until I picked up this book, I had no clue about Eastern Medicine. As a 'good Christian boy', that sounded a bit outside my realm.But, after reading Mr. Douglas' book and watching hte included DVD, I must say that I have fallen for Tai Chi and Qi-Gong 100% !!!The breathing techniques you learn early on help tremendously, especially when done daily.Now that I've read the book, I have been actively seeking a Tai Chi class here in my hometown.Easy to read and simple to follow, Mr. Douglas presents Tai Chi in a way that anyone could understand.Oh, and if you have physical limitations, DO NOT WORRY! Mr. Douglas includes information that demonstrates how you can participate in Tai Chi, too!"
5,Helpful for grasshopper,I wanted a book to tell me more about Tai Chi. This book does that in easy to understand terms.
5,makes the learning process entertaining,"This book is one of the most entertaining that I have (of all my books, not just tai chi.) It also speeds up the learning process as well because you are enjoying and remembering what you are reading. The Kuang Ping Yang style that is presented is not the style that I practice but the book is absolutely loaded with both essential and interesting information. If you want a fun book that has everything a beginner needs to know but does not act as a sleeping pill, this is the book for you."
1,Useless,"If you want to learn the form of this style, look else ware. Instructions on the form are very poor. One photo for a posture is not enough to understand how to communicate the movements of the form. The rest of the information given in the book is rather superficial.This book serves no purpose at any level..."
4,chi,detail description and instructions on how to use tai chi and the reason and uses for the program. So far it has been very helpful.
3,Very Informative but...,I found this book to be very informative but... there were just too many subtle (or not so subtle actually) advertisements by the author for his full length DVD program. The DVD that was included with the book was a disappointment to me also and was one hint after another to purchase the whole program from the author. The DVD also seemed to lack the essence of Tai Chi/Qigong and was very choppy (since of course it was actually a preview of the author's full length DVD program). I will refer to the book again but I don't ever want to suffer through the included DVD again.
5,A good introduction to Tai Chi & Qigong,Length:: 0:55 MinsThis is a brief video note receiving and recommending the Complete Idiot's Guide to Tai Chi & Qigong.
1,This is an OK book for beginners,"If you are just beginning Tai Chi this book is a start but by all means not the authority on the art. There are many books and DVD that will teach you a step-by-step way of doing tai chi. One of the best books on teaching tai chi is ""Teaching Tai Chi Effectively"" by Dr. Paul Lam. Even if you are a new student to tai chi Dr. Lam's book will help you more than this one."
2,Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi and Qi Gong,I don't find this DVD to be idiot friendly and I feel I must have bought the wrong DVD/Book. I thought it would be easy to follow and it isn't. The title is very misleading and I don't know if others have had the same problem with this book/DVD.
5,FANTASTIC Reference Book for student & teacher!,"This book is OUTSTANDING. It's a great reference tool for both the beginning student and the Instructor of T'ai Chi. I personally recommend this book to ALL of my T'ai Chi students. I have been teaching Yang Style T'ai Chi (48 step and 108 step) for the past 13 years, and am proud to be listed in the directory of this very fine book. This book promotes ALL styles of T'ai Chi. It encourages students to find a suitable class, and helps them to do so. Keep up the good work, Bill! We Love ya!"
5,Learning about Tai Chi and QiGong,"As a new student of Tai Chi and QiGong, I have enjoyed reading this book. Since I only take class once a week, there were a lot of questions and gaps in my basis knowledge of Tai Chi and QiGong. This book is a wonderful supplement to my class and has exposed me to QiGong which is now a necessary part of my week. QiGong is a series of exercises which combine breathing and relaxation. I enjoy sitting on my outside porch and doing my QiGong exercises as the stresses of the week flow away. This was a bonus as I bought the book to learn about Tai Chi. If you want to learn about Tai Chi and QiGong, I would recommend this book because it is easy to understate and is fun to read. After reading this book I have recommended it to the other students in my Tai Chi class."
2,Not true Tai Chi,"The author continues to cover the same ground on how good Tai Chi is for one medically. After about the 10th time it becomes over kill. I haven't finished the book as I'm turned off by the lack of information that is true information on how to practice Tai Chi, look for a teacher, etc. As I have now found a true Tai Chi teacher, I realize how poor this book really is. This is the authors own style and does not necessarily reflect the main Tai Chi styles taught. If you're looking for a book on ""real"" Tai Chi, this isn't it."
3,To basic,This is a great resource for someone who is looking for a very general perspective on Tai Chi. I was looking for something a little more specific. The book goes over a set of Yang 64 that I've never heard of very well in a step by step format and even comes with a cd. Unfortunatly I think the book wastes to much time talking about how to choose a style of Tai CHi and a school but its all information I did not find helpful and seemed more like filler.
4,An easy book on a difficult topic for we westerners,"This guide takes the ancient practices of T'ai Chi and QiGong and fits them into the 20th/21st century life style. It's fun, it's practical and it's serious. Using it as a guide could improve your quality of life."
2,Misleading,Misleading-----thought that we were getting a dvd for instruction as well as the book. The book is to difficult to follow but the author will be more than glad to sell you another dvd for instruction. I wish that I had not wasted the money!
1,An excersise in being wrong,"Wow, this book makes you realise how unbelievably wrong a single author can be, and pass it off as fact. She presents the argument that heavy metal and roleplaying games will cause teenagers to kill themselves, kill others, and worship the devil.It's sad that a person can believe this, and devote so much time to this. I'm sure when Gary Gygax sat down in 1970 to write Dungeons and Dragons he said 'right, my ultimate goal here is to make teenagers worship satan Hahahahaha (maniacle laughter no doubt followed). Or Judas Priest said 'yes, if we make our fans kill themselves then we'll have none left! ha! Brilliant!'An interesting book, but only when viewed from afar, as a study in how deluded some people can really be."
4,4 stars because I did enjoy reading it even though...,"... I was really expecting a lot more from this book. I purchased it for the story ""Don't Look Now"", which is often said is a mere shadow of what I think is a great film(even though the book came first). I felt that all of the stories pulled you in to begin with, but the endings were just flat? ""Not after Midnight"" was pretty good but again the ending did no justice. ""The Way of the Cross"" was also interesting, great character development from the little boy ""Robin"" way too wise for his age and ""Rev. Babcock"" talk about conflicted! But again the ending just left you empty? Not that I wanted blood and ghastliness, but just a bit more force or painful irony,à la ""The Twilight Zone""This is a good book to read to and from work (if you take the train or bus of course!)"
3,Misses the Mark,"I waited for this toy with baited breath and am sorry to say that after all the hype for this model, it was a dissapointment. The ears split and don't ""hit the mark"" and the shaft has no vibrate setting, only a rather phlegmatic rotation setting. Will keep searching for the right solo toy. Wish I had spent the money on something more classic. This ""new impoved"" model was neither."
4,Rabbit is Great!,"Let's get the negative out of the way first. The battery cover is very loose and I expect it to fall off at any time. Also, turning on the pearls really cuts back on the vibrating rabbit, which pretty much leaves you a choice of using one or the other. The pearls are also pretty loud.Now, for the positive. The rabbit is awesome! The ears are perfectly positioned and are firm enough to provide just the right amount of friction. The control for the rabbit provides a good range of vibration, which is easily adjustable.The insertable portion is smoother and firmer than toys I've had previously, which is a definate plus. I am well pleased with the product overall."
1,Disappointed,Not what I expected. Not much vibration when in use. Not worth the money. Used a few times and now found a lovely home in the city dump.
1,Terrible,"Everyone has raved about this product however, when I inserted 3 brand new batteries in and adjusted the intensity up, it BARLEY moved at all and the rabbit ears might just as well been non-exsistent. When the product was inserted it stopped ALL together, nothing, nada, zilch!!!I am LIVID that I just threw away 50.00 on something that does not work and cannot be returned and certainely wont be replaced.What a rip off.Perhaps this certian item was a ""lemon"" but I wont be throwing any more money away just to find out. Buyer Beware"
5,Nice review of cursive handwriting,"We used this book in a fourth grade class. It is not meant to be the first introduction to cursive (that should happen in grade 3) - this 96 page color workbook reviews manuscript letters (10 pages), reviews the capital cursive letters, and then covers some of the tricky letter combinations that occur in cursive writing. It provides practice in different writing forms, and has improved my daugthers handwriting. It filled in the gaps that we seem to have from the introduction to cursive in Grade 3."
2,Not his best work,"This CD includes two of Elvis' movie soundtracks from 1965, Harum Scarum (aka Harem Holiday) and Girl Happy. While both soundtracks reached the top 10 on the US album charts and Girl Happy was certified GOLD, they are not particularly strong albums. This set is recommended only for avid Elvis fans."
5,Wait and Hope,"This book is about patience - not just in the sense of waiting but in the sense of tolerating the most awful life circumstances one could imagine upon oneself, until they ultimately make way for better times that are made sweeter by perspective. Although the book itself may be an exercise in patience (it is very long!) it is very much worth reading, entertaining throughout, and divided into ""digestibly"" sized chapters. Indeed, a two-hundred-year-old novel that has stood the test of time must be pretty good, right? It is."
5,Excellent edition of the book,"This is an excellent edition of the book, it even includes a small timeline biography of Alexandre Dumas which was very insightful. Overall no complaints with this product at all."
3,Not sure why this didn't appeal to me,"I like reading older books, and I like reading longer books, but this older longer book just seemed to drag on and on. The section describing the ""drug trip"" was particularly tedious. I did some reading about the book and apparently this was a popular sort of scene in the time period in which Dumas was writing. I was yawning through it. While there was war, violence, and intrigue, I think a good editor ""trimming off the fat"" would have really helped Dumas's writing for most of the last 2/3 of the book."
5,This was a Great Book!!!,"I was required to read this book for my English class and was not exactly thrilled. I finished reading it and was completly stunned at Dumas's intelligance & brilliance. The book was wonderful & kept me reading to find out what would happen next. I felt as if I knew each & everyone of the character's keenness, evilness, kindness, & image. Although, it did have a few slow parts, the ending was wonderful. I would definatly read it again."
4,Big Long Book(that's a plus),"Well, as any person would first notice about this book, it's HUGE! Or, at least it looked that way. I found the random use of French words irritating and i think that if a book is going to be translated they should at least translate it all of the way. I understand that the French is supposed to make an impression on me, but i like to know what i'm reading about. I love the plot. I love being able to constantly have to remember people who have not been mentioned in around 400 pages and have to test my brain to keep the plot straight. The other great thing is to be able to realize what's happening befor eit has been pointed out. READ THIS! pace yourself, and, if you don't like remembering too much at once, make a flow chart!"
5,Great book!,"I read this book when I was 14 and I loved it, I still do! this is well worth reading. It is an exciting tale of adventure and revenge and one man's story! I loved it! read it!"
5,Great book,My husband has been wanting this book for a long time and when I gave to him he was so excited! The book came in perfect condition and fast shipping!
1,Scholastic version of the Count incomplete,"I purchased the Scholastic version of the book so I could finish reading the novel (I had it on my PDA and lost my PDA). After finishing reading the Scholastic printing of the book, I found the book seemed to leave many unanswered questions, so I thought I would re-read it. It was then that I discovered that the scholastic publication is missing some of the chapters (though the included chapters are sequentially numbered). In fact, a person reading the Scholastic printing would never understand the most important act which caused Edmond Dantes so much grief, as that most important chapter, ""the Conspiracy"" is one of the omitted chapters. Thus, this printing is, in my humble opinion, worthless.The book, as a whole, is great, and I recommend the book (in its complete form) to anyone."
4,Great book,"The story is very captating, it taps into two of humanities' basic desires; revenge and power. Too many french words were left unexplained in the book, I assume that they were just copied from the original text. That is the only reason that the book was kept from attaining the ultimate goal of five stars. If you liked the Three Musketeers, you'll love this book"
5,The greatest piece of fiction in the world!,"This is, without a doubt, the most masterful piece of storytelling to ever have been written. Alexandre Dumas paints a canvas of characters that are larger-than-life, with motives such as revenge, deceit, greed, lust, vindictiveness, and a sense of justice propelling them. This book has everything!If you are looking for an epic adventure, then this is the ultimate book for you.This book has been my favorite novel since I was required to read it in 9th grade English class. Over the years I have visited and revisited it, and have yet to grow tired of it."
1,Missing content,"This review applies only to the 2002 Modern Library Classics edition of the book. I read the book partly online but mostly as this paperback. At the very end there is, in this paperback edition, a very important section missing. It's in chapter 113. Right after Dantes takes his leave of Mercedes, and before he meets Morrel in the cemetery, the online version includes what must be several pages where Dantes returns to the Chateau d'If. Inexplicably, the whole episode is missing in this paperback edition."
5,A truly remarkable work!,"This is one of the best books ever written. The characterizations are remarkable. Certainly a ""must-have"" for anyone who likes to read. It is a long book, but the richness of the text will more than compensate you for the time spent reading.The characters all comport themselves with a dignity and nobility that cannot be seen or portrayed by people of our time period. It is as though all of the characters have the distinction of Anthony Hopkins(and this still does not do it justice!). This work is a feast for the mind!"
1,a trick,"you find it almost impossible to determine the translator of this book, either from the amazon description or even from an examination of the physical book itself. only by an in-depth reading of almost the entire introduction is it made clear that the translation is quite old, and considered one of the worst. surprised eco put his name to this."
4,clandestine exact revenge,"Great story, but very wordy. Had a lot of trouble getting through a few chapters but it was well worth the effort. Inversely there were a few chapters that were great, and I flew through"
3,READ DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY,"i really really liked this book when we had to read it for school back in 10th grade. we only had to read the abridged version (which was kick ass) so i went for the unabridged to see what it was all about....long story short i'm never going to know. this thing is longer than a dictionary. as in over a thousand pages. an amazing story but if i re-read it i'll go with the abridged version. ive never heard of a book that had me thinking ""yeah, i'd read 1100 pages of that"""
3,Good Book,"I bought this book because it was a classic, and nothing bad has happened to my Kinde 2 yet. So far, it is an okay book."
5,Alexandre Dumas - Creative Writer or Tedious Instinct?,"My AP English teacher recommended this book for me to read over the monthly required reading list, and I thought, ""Oh great, what a great idea....<yawn>"". But it was for two months because of its length, so I took it.Each chapter includes a specific idea to the plot that keeps you wanting to read more. I would bring this book to work and read a chapter a day during my 15 minute break and would go overboard reading two chapters because it just keeps getting better and better! Each new idea came as a surprise for me, and so much is in it that I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good book.Alexandre Dumas sure knew what he was doing when he read this, so I definitely recommend this."
3,"Wonderful book, DREADFUL edition","I picked up the book because I found the movie very entertaining and thought it'd be nice to read the classic novel. I bought this edition and was halfway through it before I found out it was abridged. It does not say so anywhere on the book and I frankly don't know how that is allowed. As soon as I found out I went and got the complete version of the book and started all over. It astounds me how much they cut out. They pretty much butchered the story. Please read the book because is fabulous, but not this version."
2,Mis information,"Unfortunately when I ordered this edition, it was not shown that this is only the abridged version. I was looking forward to getting into a good story, when on the first page I see that is is abridged. I specifically looked when I ordered to see if it was the short version and there were no indications to that effect. So be careful! If you want the full version you have to make sure that you don't order this exact item."
5,ADVENTURE,"Dumas... Master of adventure. His books take you away, but you have to keep up with the pace. Fantasy is in a mix with reality. What is true and what is Dumas?"
4,"""Wait and Hope""","""All human wisdom is summed up in two words-wait and hope"".(Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte-Cristo). That is not enough to live but it helps one survive and life is based on surviving. Hopes and dreams of happiness crushed for Edmon Dantres on the day they were supposed to come true, every single one of them. But he beat prison, he beat death, he beat all his misfurtunes, he became bigger-that-life, the Count of Monte-Cristo, just to get his revenge to all those who broke his life.This is a novel about a man whose only goal became revenge but was it the right thing to do? This book is not too deep but it has some kind of sense of exitment that keeps you reading every single page."
3,The Count of Monte Cristo,Book was ok. I should have read the description better. It may be a good gift for my niece.
1,A shameless abridgment,"Although billed by Amazon as unabridged, this is a butchering of the story that would make Dumas roll in his grave. The back of the box says ""abridged,"" yet somehow the store insists it is unabridged, simply because it is longer than other audio additions. Make no mistake, many rich and wonderful (not to mention important) are left off with no attempt to apologize, repent, or make amends. A proper COUNT audio book should be in the neighborhood of 30 CDs...this one is only 14, although this information is concealed in the product description. The picture shown is not accurate. BEWARE!"
1,Does a terrible description presage a terrible version?,""""" This is the best version of this book in kindle store! It contents a unique images plus a dinamic table of content. The book made up in original way. """"I don't think a book description this illiterate (referring to both language and technology) can be taken seriously. No spell check? No grammar check? Give me a break!Moving along to the next version..."
5,A way to live,"Out of all the many books that I have read, I would have to say that ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is one of the most personally influential books that I have ever read. I had used to have a terrible temper, but here I saw the value of controling ones rage. Edmond endured a trial by fire and with inventiveness and unwavering steadfastness was able to achieve his goals. His revenge in each was a fitting exactment of justice. I personally love the revenge on Danglers. While the ending was predictable, I think that was the whole point. Revenge certainly is a dish better served cold. Anyone looking for an original story, and one that has obviously insipired many writers of our day. Read ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", and feel that certain power that only a classic novel can create."
5,The County of Monte Cristo,"Love this book, can read over and over again. Compelling, cannot put the book down. Highly recommendThe Count of Monte Cristo-a must read for everyone. Classic!!"
2,Terribly converted e-book format,I couldn't get past the first 5 chapters in this book due to the number of typos and poor translation. As soon as I'd begin to be immersed in the story a string of typos would trip me up and frustrate me. Often times I'd find myself re-reading a paragraph more than once to try and figure out what was being said because of the bad translation. This is certainly not a Wordsworth e-book conversion! You're better off just buying the book instead of this.
4,Thoughtful and well written classic,"They do not write stories like this anymore. It is a complex and long read but worthy of the time. Without any spoilers, after about 150 pages into it, the novel will be hard to put down!"
3,free for kindle. it's in my queue,It's on my kindle waiting to be read. I downloaded a ton of free books. I didn't have any issues getting it to my kindle. I have it as a reference book.
5,Great version,This is the full version. Great read! If you are going to buy one this is the true book no short cuts.
4,Great translation,"This is one of the books I should have read ages ago but have never picked up. I first started to read a different translation, but the language and sentence structure gave it no narrative flow. The Buss translation is terrific. The adventure tale of wrongful imprisonment and revenge keeps you reading for long periods of time. A little history lesson about Napolean and the Borgias is painless and welcome. When we read older books we are reminded how little human emotions have changed over 200 years.This translation is highly recommended."
4,Good Book,"I couldn't put the book down for the first 300 pages. It pretty much has everything - wit, wisdom, an interesting plot and a bit of History. It didn't get a five star rating because it seemed like it was a different author with a totally different style in the middle section and picked up back again at the last part.I understand this is a good translation of the book."
4,"The Story is excellent, and this is the Unabridged edition","This is the only Unabridged edition of The Count of Monte Cristo I have been able to find for Kindle. It looks like a public domain copy that has been adapted, but it is formatted well. It doesn't say who the translator is. It has the whole 117 chapters. It is worth the 99 cents, if you want the unabridged version. I think if you read the abridged you are missing out on some great parts of a great story. I gave this 4 stars because it looks like the public domain and has no extas that a lot of the big publishers have, but still, a great buy and a great version."
4,A classic Novel!,"As human beings, we, for the most part believe in justice. When you strike me on one cheek, I should be allowed to strike you on the other, or at the very least sue you in court for the monetary damages your strike caused me. This sense of justice often transcends both culture and age. However, in many situations, justice does not occur. Evil men and women prosper at the expense of the good without consequence. Crimes and wrong doings go unpunished by the court of law. The question becomes should humans be allowed to take revenge for the crimes and evil committed against them when the legal system is too corrupt, lazy or ineffective to do anything about it. This question of vengeance is really the central question of Alexander Dumas classic novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, a thrilling tale of crime, escape and vengeance set in 19th century, post-Revolution France."
4,The Count of Monte Cristo,I bought this book for one of my children for a summer reading project. I needed a specific version and was glad I could search Amazon by ISBN. The book arrived quickly and the price was reasonable. I'm sure other family members will enjoy the book when the project is complete.
2,Disappointed,I thought this was a book about the sandwich. I was so disappointed. They should add an epilogue describing the origins of the sandwich. Then it might be worth reading. :P
2,Not impressed,This book was VERY well worn and the pages are falling out. Not happy at all.Will be more careful about buying used books in the future.
2,"The book is great, this edition isnt","Please note that the product details dont mention it but this is an ABRIDGED edition and as such, leaves exactly those details out that make the book a classic. Dont get suckered into buying this edition coz it's cheap."
5,"This version is ABRIDGED, Amazon info has been updated, thanks!","Updated to 5-star: Originally I gave this a low rating because it was incorrectly marked as the Unabridged version. Amazon has corrected this, so I'm editing my review. Great book at a great price. Thanks, Amazon!Old Review: Note: 1-star rating is only to bring attention to the edition of the book! I'm sure this is a great book, I'm really looking forward to reading it, but after much debate I decided to get the Unabridged version, and ordered this item - I got the book in the picture, but it's Abridged. Not worth returning (Great deal, $5 book!), but just a heads up for others in the same boat."
2,It's not the Monte Cristo story - it's just a brief overview of it,"I only give this book 2 stars because I love the story. But I can't rate this edition higher because... well, to say that there are chapters missing in this edition would be to say nothing. I have read the original: it consists of two volumes each one of which is twice as thick as this book! Because chunks are take out, a lot of times you can't quite catch the story and figure out why things went the way they went. The story of Cadrousse and Andrea is missing completely, the reason why Villefort had a change of heart is not clear, the story of Danglars being kidnapped by the Roman bandits, Danglars' daughter running away from home, the results of Monte Cristo's visit to the telegraph... and that's not all! Good 3/4 of the original story is completely missing! It's sad that classics are disrespected in such an outrageous way."
1,ditto,"i had a similar experience as previously indicated. in fact i ordered both the unabridged and abridged versions of this product and received the exact same product (despite the fact that the allegedly unabridged version was 2X the cost.) if you'll notice, the picture are confusing and therefore you don't know what you will be receiving. now i am looking elsewhere for an unabridged version as the information on amazon is inconclusive and ultimately unhelpful."
2,I'm really sorry I read the unabridged version,"The unabridged version of this is huge, huge. Like 1200 pages.I actually did read all of it. First time, though, that I would have to count myself sorry that I read the unabridged version of anything.There were exciting elements to the plot, to be sure, but after Dantes makes sure that M. Morrel is taken care of (p. 300 in the Penguin Classics edition: the part where the narrator skips ahead 10 years without telling you), the next 800 pages or so really drag. It's obvious that, at this time, writers were being paid by the word.Could be much stronger as a shorter (er, say, 200 pages) novel."
1,what the hell,"are reviews for the great and wonderful novel by Dumas doing here under ths comic book? Shame on you Amazon for this ridiculous connection and false advertising. To quote John, Give Me a Break!"
3,Not the best Dumas book,"First, I love the idea of the Count of Monte Cristo but this book was far too wordy and took too long to get good. I had to push through it. The count seemed so cold in the book that I did not invest much emotion into him, he lost Edmond in his personality until the very end. Although the plots for revenge were far better in the book I can actually say that I liked the movie better. First time for everything. The two were completely different. Kindle did a good job of converting it to digital though. I am a very fast reader and it took forever to read this book! Much prefer the Three Musketeers."
5,Incredible,"I have read this book 3 times and it is still my absolute favorite. The language, detail, and life of Edmond Dantes as depicted by Dumas is unlike any other book I have read. There is no filler or boring moments. Every line gives great insight into the characters. The idea Dumas presents is novel and paints revenge different than any way I thought about in the past. The movie is a disaster and distortion of the main points the book presents by the way. A must read."
3,Translation,"This is a very poor translation of The Count of Monte Cristo. The story is wonderful, but get it somewhere else."
5,Easy to digest and fun,"Just finished this marvelous classic. Don't delay - start reading today, this new translation is fabulous. Now it's on to Madame Bovary!"
4,ssoooo good!,"This is a great book full of betrayal and deceit. It may be long but it's definitely worth reading.Edmond Dantes was a sailor from Marseilles, poised to be married to Mercedes, a beautifl village girl. However, enemies of Dantes plan his arrest on the day that is planned for his wedding and he is condemnned to imprisonment on a desolate island in the dreaded Chateau D'If. Here, he meets the priest Faria who helps plan Dantes' escape and tells him of a treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond escapes the prison and goes to retreive the treasure and changes his identity. Now he is called the Count of Monte Cristo. He goes back to the mainland to retreive his love and seek revenge on his betrayers.I used a copy by signet classics, the editing was terrible and I found at least five typos; it was kind of distracting. I do highly recommend reading the book though!!!(only get a different version)"
5,"Whoa, what a book!!!","A brilliant piece of literature, a real tribute to French literature, Alexandre Dumas is a genius with all the subplots and major plots that he intertwines which makes this a superb novel. I found myself guessing about what was going to happen next but each time I tried to guess, I was wrong. I loved the character development. There were so many characters in this novel and each character brought new attributes to ""the table"" which made the book even more interesting. Also I loved the plot development. There were so many subplots that all ended up tying into the main plot which made the book that much more interesting. Starting out as an honest sailor in Marseilles, he is framed for being a Bonapartist, and is sentenced to life in jail... With little hope for escape he is left to die in his cell, but when he meets Abbe Faria his luck just starts to turn around... With this in mind I would definitely encourage others to read this book!"
2,"Fabulous Book, Lousy Copy","Not a bad translation, but AVOID AT ALL COSTSThis is an abridged version, and as such a waste and a slap in the face to the author's original vision.I'm doubly upset because I didnt notice this was abridged till I already bought it, and was already 200 pages into it."
5,an exciting tale of revenge,this book is awesome. Its a little complicated because of all of the characters and the past crimes they have commited but in the end the characters all tie together in weird twists of fate. You'll enjoy every one. The book is so different from the movie. Way better!! It goes into more detail and depth.
4,"Generally OK, but suffers from contemporary usage blight","A good translation from the nineties, but a definite product of the intellectually stilted academic elite, i.e. the translator takes pains to correct the ""benighted"" errors of the author by inserting common vulgar usage such as (and here I am quoting from memory) ""We were surprised by him answering us,"" ""...he or she"" rather than ""his"" as the gender comprehensive, ""...as if it was"" (rather than ""as if it were...""). I guess we all can be thankful for the translator's avoidance of the awful ""their"" as the gender comprehensive.I found the annotations in the back surprisingly difficult to work with, considering the fine annotations extant in the other Penguin editions of Dumas. The weakness here is that the annotations are by chapter heading rather than page number, hence making their lookup much more difficult.A good read overall, however."
5,There was nothing wrong :),"I ordered the used version of the Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas and the book had said it was in ""good"" condition, but I felt like it was in very good conition. The cover had no knicks or bent edges to it and the inside was just fine. There were no markings or folds in it at all, and I'm pretty sure there weren't ripped pages."
5,One of my two favorite books,I absolutely love The Count of Monte Cristo and look forward to reading it again (and again). Revenge is sweet!
1,mauvais livre,"This a really crummy translation. No one is credited anywhere, though there's some worthy who contributed an introduction."
2,"Four stars for story, one star for translation","I agree with everyone else when I say that the story of 'The Count' is gripping, exciting, etc. The translations, on the other hand, especially this one, leave much to be desired. The English is stilted and uninspiring, and many times it seems like the text was translated word-for-word without necessary changes in sentence structure.Alexandre Dumas is much better in the original French."
5,Another Classic,"Was forced to read as a teenager and just read again in my 40's. Wonderfully written (maybe a little wordy), awesome characters, love story, adventure, intrigue, etc. What more could you ask of a book?"
5,Excellent Classic!,"The book is a little hard to follow, but the storylines come together perfectly! I was amazed at the level of detail and planning foresight of the author. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their knowledge of famous classics.Dumas is a literary genius!"
5,Christmas gift,My son is an avid reader and is interested in reading the classics. The look of the cover is very nice according to my son. He said he is looking forward to reading The Count of Monte Cristo! It's is the second classic I have purchased for him and will continue purchasing more of the classics to help him build up his library of classic books.
5,Great Story,"This is an excellent book. I love the classics and had somehow managed to have never read this one until last year. Amazingly, it feels like a story upon a story upon a story. It has the beautiful quality of building anticipation from beginning to end and continuing the story when you are afraid it is about to end! More recent books always leave you with the feeling that you want to know what will happen next when the book has ended, this story gives you everything you could ever want and more beyond your imagination. I highly recommend it!"
5,"Fantastic Classic, Best Version",The greatest story of revenge ever told! The un-abridged version is the only way to go with this book. The everyman's library hardcover is a beautiful book with very nice pages. It is a very sleek stylish looking book too when you remove the cover slip.
1,Wrong Product,"When I paid for this book, I ordered the ADULT version of The Count of Monte Cristo. I was sent a copy of an illustrated children's version which is what I DID NOT order. What I tried to purchase was the exact book that fit the description I read before I added it to my cart. I still love Amazon, just a bad experience with this purchase. Oh well."
5,The Count of Monte Cristo is a gorgeous novel of suspense.,"The Count of Monte Cristo has to have been one of the memorable books I have ever encountered. It is one of those great stories capable of pulling the reader in, overcoming the barriers of time, lanuage and culture. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to spend a lot of time with a truly enjoyable novel."
5,Excelent Book Shows the nature of vengence on a person,"Dauntes a sailor on the verge of of marrying the woman he truley loves. Is betrayed by the people he trusts. And hate and vengance keeps him going throught his time in prison. Dumas describs in detail how he plots and scemes to get his revenge on those who wronged him. How it consumes him every waking hour of his life. He beleves he is doing gods vengence on those who wronged him. But starts doughting it all when little Edword dies unsuspectingly. and how he realizes vengence is for god to do not him, and that this vengence has cost him his happiness all those years. And he realizes that the Young woman he saved from slavery really loves him (she realizes vengence has caused her unhappiness), and that he can really be happy again with her. The unabridged version is the best one."
5,excellent service,I received a beautiful book to give my daughter for her birthday. The condition was just as it was described and the service was excellent.
5,Awesome!,Very entertaining adventure-fiction classic. Once you begin you can't put it down. Highly recommended.Now I have to read Aledandre Duma'sThe Three Musketeersas well.
5,Awesome Book,Excellent version of this book. The Count of Monte Cristo has never had a better translation.
2,Abridged,"While it doesn't indicate it, this is a heavily abridged version of the story, and pretty much just deals with the elements contained in the 2002 film. It's still a good story, but gets 2 stars for not indicating that it's abridged, and because even at 1400 pages, the full unedited story by Dumas is MUCH richer and makes for a much more satisfying story. Do not cheat yourself of that satisfaction by settling for 1/3 of the story."
3,Bad shipping for a good book.,"I bought this book new thinking I would get a book in perfect condition, wrong. I am in no way insulting the book the book is great. In no way was the book protected. No bubble wrap or anything. The book was shoved in a box and was not secured or covered and the box was not even taped shut. The box fell open on my porch because it was not secure. The book had minor scratches and rips on the cover, back, and pages due to shipping, and the box was way to big. So I guess that is ""priority shipping""."
2,Unreal...,"I like Sci-Fi books, and tried something new...the classic, The Count of Monte Cristo. Needless to say, it's not much more believable, the odds of colonizing Mars are better than these events."
3,Histoire d'une Revanche,"""Histoire d'une Revanche"" was a book adapted from ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and I am obliged to read this for my french class. My teacher showed us part of the movie (in english!) and so far I find it very interesting. Reading it in frecn takes longer for moi beacuse I'm not exactly that good in french and our books are so old and falling apart. It seems a good book to continue readin so I'd recommend people to read it but find an english copy because the french one is out of print."
1,Really?,"OK. Short and Sweet. Basically I needed a SPECIFIC book to read over summer for my english class. TRUSTING the seller, I ordered there book, which gives the specific kind of book because there are many many versions, and I needed this one. SO I order it, even get the fast shipping because I needed it in a week or so...they sent me a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT version from what i ordered. ON TOP OF THAT THE SELLER DOES NOT RESPOND TO MY EMAIL SO I CANT RETURN. THEN I HAD TO GET ANOTHER BOOK. SO THANK YOU. MAKE SURE TO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. NEVER. THEY WONT GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY'S WORTH. (THE SELLER : any_book)"
1,Formatting is wrong,"Someone at Amazon needs to fix the left-hand margin... the left margin is wider than the right, and it drives me nuts! It shouldn't be that hard.This seems to happen a lot with the free classics from Project Gutenberg."
1,Count of Monte Cristo,"Story has good twists, but there are too many French places and people which makes the audio confusing."
3,THE COUNT OF MONEY CRISTO,"COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is excellent until Edmond Dantes escapes from prison and suddenly becomes Barack Obama with a sack full of cash bailing everyone out. Edmond isnt obsessed with revenge, he's an obsessed do-gooder and effeminate fop. Edmond is the omniscient (know it all), mystery man who takes years and years to accomplish his revenge. By page 500 you dont care if he does or doesnt.I'm surprised the villains didnt die of old age, and its amazing that Mercedes even remembered him.See the movie and spare yourself the tedium of reading the book."
1,"Terrible, terrible edition","A wonderful classic story butchered by a senseless editor who removed major portions of the story without letting the reader know. The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there."
1,Half the story omitted,"I thought this story was very difficult to follow. I even restarted it after reading the first hundred or so pages. Now I know why...there are several chapters intentionally omitted in this version, making it impossible to make sense of the text. I am angered that the publisher butchered the story without letting the consumer know that it had been done. Do not buy this book, or any other ""Enriched Classic""."
5,The BEST book I've ever read. I'll miss it.,"Monsieur Le Comte is incredible!!!! The best book I've ever read; I'll miss it... I could not tear myself away from this book... My two year-old recognizes it as ""papi's book"" because I could not put it down.... I kept my wife up with the story and got a chance to relive it that way. She loved it too.Dumas makes you fall in love with his characters, with Mercedes, Edmond Dantes, Abbe Faria, Valentine, Haydee, M.Morrel.... and he makes you hate the bad guys, Danglars, Villefort, Morcef... But in the end you end up doubting just like M. Le Comte.... Every character has an incredible story and every story will take you deap into the time and place and the feeling of it all....This book cannot be described. It must be read. If you will only read one good book in your life; make sure it's this one."
4,Don't read the abridged version!,"While I really enjoyed The Count of Monte Cristo, I felt that there was something missing. Imagine my shock when I came here and read the reviews stating that the unabridged book is 1400 pages long; and I realized that I had read the ABRIDGED version at 472 pages long!! Obviously, they cut a lot out of the abridged version. While it was still very good, it was lacking and I felt there were ""holes"" in the story (now I know why). I'll definitely be buying the unabridged version so I can re-read it."
5,Buy the Buss...,"Lots of people try the Count of Monte Cristo and give up... it is very long, very complicated and in the original English translation, very hard to read and enjoy. Robin Buss's (1996) translation for Penguin Classics is fantastic - delivering the complete and unabridged (1316 page) original story translated into smoothly flowing idiomatically correct English. Sure, you can pick up the 1850s version for free on Project Gutenburg, but if you're going to commit to a novel of this quality and length, why not spend the $5 and experience the best it has to offer?"
5,BRILLANT!!!,"I loved this book and it has easily became my favorite!! When I first started this book I didn't make it past the first page because I just couldn't get into it. However, a few weeks later I opened the book again and couldn't stop reading. Don't let the page count deter you. This book is genius. The count of monte cristo has it all and just when you think you've seen the last of a character, he/she pops right back up. I love how everything comes together. Make sure to read the unabridged version because other wise you would just miss out on all the stuff that makes this book great. And you can't go wrong with the Robin Buss translation. Enjoy!!"
5,A great book.,"The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing story filled with action, betrayal, romance, and vengeance. Edmond Dantes is a young sailor who has everything he needs in life. He has a wife and a large amount of money to start a family. He is betrayed by his friends and sent to the dreaded Chateau d'If, and is imprisoned for life. Edmond thinks his life is over, so he swears vengeance to all who betrayed him. Edmond makes a miraculous escape and puts his plans into motion. He is determined to gain vengeance and nothing thrown in his way will stop him. He adopts the name Count of Monte Cristo and becomes friends with the ones who betrayed him. He gains his vengeance slowly by revealing little secrets about each of them, while revealing nothing at all about him. This is a story of a man who was wrongfully accused, and was able to escape and return the favor to his friends. The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing book by Alexandre Dumas, and it is also one of his best."
5,The best book in the world,"I have just finished reading this, which in my opinion is the best book in the world. Everything about it is amazing. The plot is captivating and fulfilling. Dantes's intricately planned vengeance on the men who ruined his life is so detailed and amazing it leaves me speachless. I love how the book leaves hints of future events and things which at one point may not make sense. Later, however, their purpose is revealed and they help the reader to understand the current events as well as show the how the past, present, and future of Edmond Dantes's life is connected. All those who have given this book 1 star are simpletons who were forced into reading it and never even tried to appreciate it."
5,Not just a great adventure novel...,"Alexandre Dumas was considered in his time to be the foremost adventure novelist. What he created in The Count of Monte Cristo is so much more. The story chronicles the journey of Edmund Dantes, a young and hopelessly naive sailor as he matures into the worldy and cynical Count bent on revenge. Had Dumas ended there, he would have written a stupendous and sweeping saga of adventure and drama. The greater relevence of the story is in its moral telling: Edmund Dantes regains his humanity and learns to live again. Here is a story of spiritual redemption, told against the backdrop of post-Napoleanistic France. It is a tale of love, of loss, of revenge, and of the rekindling of the heart. While the unabridged story is long, it is best enjoyed while seated in front of a fire, with a warm beverage in hand. Few narratives are as satisfying to the soul as this one is."
5,This is the Complete and Unabridged and IT IS BETTER!,"Little known fact :Dumas was paid by his Royal benefactor ""By the Line"":Hence his novels tended to be Very Long. But in the Count of Monte Cristo this is just More of a Good Thing. This novel of over 1000 pages is to be savored for its many attributes. The characters seem to come to life as The Count goes thru his trials and tribulations. This has it all: Adventure,suspense,joy, tragedy ,Love , hate and Let's not forget Revenge. This book is a great read and if you take the easy way and read another abridged version then you are not savoring a mouth watering chocolate moose but settling for a cardboard tasting diet cookie."
5,The ultimate REVENGE book. A fantastic read,"I've read this book twice and I'll read it again. This is one of the best novels ever. The ultimate story of revenge, it is truly realistic. I recommend this book highly."
4,A classic story told in a nice edit,I sought out the Bantam Classic version of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo as I feel it is presented in an easy to read format. The book allows many areas for note taking and highlighting. I would recommend this version of the classic to any High School or College Student who is studying this work. I also recommend Dumas' story as it is a great tale.
5,Positively Stunning,"I just finished reading this book for school, and I absolutely loved it!! Dumas' captivating writing style combined with the intriguing tale of Edmond Dantes make this novel a must read for all lovers of classics and quality literature."
2,"Abridged version, buyer beware.","This is the abridged version of the Dumas classic.Having not read the original yet, I can only compare itto The Three Musketeers. Dumas' writing style losesenergy in the abridging process. The reader ought tobe aware that the story has been simplified and summarized.If you want the true flavor of Dumas, order the unabridgedversion."
2,save yourself dont read this book! watch the movie instead,"THIS BOOK IS BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I watched the movie, and loved it, but was completely and totally bored by the book. on the other hand the movie was wonderful. lots of action and drama. it is about a young man who is framed and taken to the prison island of monte christo. he escapes and finds treasure in a hidden cove. He uses the riches to take revenge on his enemy who framed him. please take my advice and just watch the movie."
1,My Kindle Froze,"After I downloaded this book, I went to change my font; My Kindle froze up, I powered it off, and now it won't turn back on. I am about to call customer service. I would suggest not downloading this book if I were you, quite yet..."
1,Limited availablity DISAPPOINTING FROM AMAZON,"Having just got a new Kindle I was searching for some classics to read and was really excited to find this book.That is until I tried, in vain, to download it to my Kindle.Apparently it is NOT available to customers in Canada.Amazon - WHY IS THAT?"
1,A weak and long novel offering little substance.,"The text is long, but is an easy read. The characters are all flat, with the exception being one of the villians. There is the occasional bright spot, but these are usually separated by two or three hundred pages. I would only recommend this novel to people whose age is counted using a single digit."
1,poorly bound and defective,"The copy , Pequin bound, Count of Monte Cristo fell apart in my hands, as I turned a page it fell out. This began to happen on page 10 and then an entire section, about 30 pages fell out. I had been taping the pages back in place but with the big chunk I sewed along the binding edge and secured the bundle back in the book with tape. The pages continued to fall out and by page 55 I gave up and bought another copy from a different source. This is my first book purchase from Amazon... hmmmm... it will be a long time before I make another."
5,The Adventures of The Count of Monte Cristo,"The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is an excellent book for people who like classics with an actual meaning to it. This book desribes a man's life and the friends who betrayed him because of their jealousy. As he makes a ""comeback"" as a completely different and sophisticated man, the Count of Monte Cristo gives no mercy to those who betrayed him. With all this merciless revenge, Dumas shows the real meaning of love and how forgiving may be the solution to your problems. The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite number one book and I recommend this book to people of all ages!"
5,Astounding book!,"When I first started this book, I thought, ""Oh, I'm never going to finish!"" That was very wrong. This masterpiece of a novel is next-to-impossible to put down. I became so involved in the book that, when I finished, I felt sort of deprived. I wished the book would continue for another 1,000 pages. By the way, if you're going to read this book, don't read the abridged version. It is NOTHING like the unabridged, original copy."
5,Best book EVER,"This is my all-time favorite book. I've read it at least 15 times. This book has something to offer to absolutely anyone that can read -- revenge, romance, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, political intrigue, history, etc. The cast of characters is unforgettable and well developed. The depth and breadth of the revenge plot in this book is unprecedented and unmatched. I wrote a paper on this book for my Revenge Literature class in college. Whenever I have been dissatisfied with recent books and need something really great to fall back on, I pick this book up again and love it just as much."
5,READ THIS BOOK....NOW!!!!!,"I have spent hundreds of dollars on this site and have never been provoked to write a review...until now. The Count of Monte Cristo has got to be one of the greatest books ever written. I'm telling you now, read this unabridged version, and it will change the way you look at fiction for the rest of your life. I promise. I'm an avid reader (I teach high school literature) and made it to my late 20's without ever reading this unabridged version. Man am I glad I decided to pick it up and read it. Don't be scared by the number of pages (1245). I absolutely promise you will finish it in no time. I mentioned to the person who suggested I read this version this comment, ""there is no soul on this earth who would not like this book"". Pretty intense I know, but do yourself a favor...buy the book, read it, get lost in it, tell other people about it, and love literature. You will not be disappointed. Have fun...I DID!!!!"
5,Finally - modern and unabridged on Kindle,"This review is for the Kindle edition ASIN: B002RI9KL8. Don't get any other Kindle edition, even though they might be cheaper. This is complete and unabridged and with a superb modern translation by Robyn Buss."
5,The Count of Monte Cristo; Sould You Read It?,"The Count of Monte Cristo, some people did not know it was a book until the movie came out, some people still don't even know it is a book. I thought it was an exciting, keep you on the edge of your chair, hafta turn the page, cliff hanger. That is, until you get past the first five pages of boring mush (literally only 5 pages). It is a classic story about a man who has everything going for him; until, on his wedding day his supposed friends frame him and send him to the legendary Chateau d'If for the rest of his life. But when he escapes from prison and finds a gigantic treasure, he sets out to reclaim his lost love and exact a slow, fitting punishment on his betrayers. Will he find his beloved Mercedes and get his revenge against his enemies, or will his whole plot go ka-put?"
5,The Best Book Ever,"This is the best book I have ever read. I am not usually the type that likes to read books as long as this but The Count of Monte Cristo was worth all the pages. I have never been more excited to read a book before. Each time I picked it up I would tell myself I only had time to read one chapter but I always read about ten chapters before finally and reluctantly putting the book down. If I was to recommend any book to anyone, this would be the book. No matter what you are looking for in a book you can find it in this book."
5,The Counte Of Monte Cristo,"Assigned the book as a termpaper project, I dreaded the thought of having to read this 1400 page monster. But as soon as I began read this book I was quite pleased with the plot. I admired Dumas' ability to patiently draw out the story as to build mounds and mounds of suspense. How he played out the revenge of the Count is the most interesting and compelling part of the story. What an amazing book!"
3,Pay attention,"This book clearly states that it is abridged on the back cover. I realize it would be helpful if it was stated on this pages title but that just goes to show you that you always need to do your research folks. I can't vouch for this edition specifically but the first version I read was abridged very enjoyable. I do however prefer the unabridged. Also whenever purchasing a book originally written in another language you should always check for reviews about the translation, there are usually multiple translations of various quality from different publishers."
5,Favorite Book,A book that you don't want to put down. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys reading.
2,"Careful, this one's ABRIDGED!","This isn't a review so much as a warning; I never read the book once I found out that it is an abridged edition. It says so across the back of the book, but there's nothing about it on Amazon's page. I sent the book back and received a refund. If you want to read Alexandre Dumas's complete masterpiece, find yourself another edition."
1,ABRIDGED!!,"Nowhere in the description of this item or in the book itself does it mention that this is an abridged book with a number of plot resolving sections omitted. Amazon - you must state in the listing for these ""Enriched Classics"" books that they are abridged and therefore are useless as school books, etc. Very misleading by the publisher!"
3,WARNING: THIS IS THE ABRIDGED VERSION,"This is getting 3 stars because the story is GREAT, but THIS EDITION IS ABRIDGED. Nowhere on the book does it say it's abridged, but it is. It is approximately 600 pages long, while the original is over 1300 pages --- that is some SERIOUS EDITING.There are some pretty important words in the half they ripped out; including some major developments for specific characters -- a murder, a family leaving one of the targets of the Count's wrath, etc.This is a GREAT story, just not this edition."
2,TOO LOOONG,"I thought it was time I read this classic. Didn't know until I finished it's 1312 pages! Started out fine. but really bogged down. Dumas kept dragging in so many characters, it was hard to keep them all straight.Part of the problem was that, if I read wiki correctly, it was originally written as a serial - you know, like soap operas that never have a conclusion. There really wasn't a conclusion, in my mind, to this book.Bought free from Amazon and downloaded to my BlackBerry and read a chapter a day for 3 months. Since I always have my phone with me, could read it while waiting for a plane or on a plane at home and abroad or in a line etc."
5,Best Written Book,"It is rare to find in modern writing the wonderful complexity that exists in this book. It is a classic for a reason, and i consider it one of the best written stories i have ever read."
1,Waste of money!,"This review is for this version, not the book itself, which is amazing. You find it almost impossible to determine the translator of this book, either from the amazon description or even from an examination book itself. Only by an in-depth reading of almost the book is it made clear that the translation is quite poor, and considered one of the worst."
1,Horrible,Don't waste your time reading this edition. There are many grammatical errors in this edition. Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book.
3,difficult to read,"very wordy and difficult to read... I realize writers from that era really talked that way, but this story was especially wordy and hard to get through.. I will try again eventually."
5,Great story of redemption,"Sweet revenge at it's finest.Love, romance, long friendship gone wrong.It's all in here. Not like the movie, so don't beterribly disappointed."
2,"what I bought, not what i expected","Count of MC is quite possibly one of the best books ever written. This 300-450 page novel does not do it justice. A lot of passages have been edited out and in some way translated extremely poorly. As a fan of Dumas or just a reader I would NOT recommend this book, instead go and get the 1000-1100 page version, idk if they make it in a softcover though, but that edition is EPIC.This is like watching a movie in fastforward, you miss a ton of the most important vital conversations/scenes b/c you're only skipping through for the action, and then just as you're about to get interested it'll end.Great for highschool book reports terrible for people that actually enjoy reading."
5,The Best book of all!,"The Count of Monte Cristo is truly the best book I have ever read. The book is about a young salior named Edmond Dantes who is framed for a terrible crime by ones whom he named friends. In prison he plans revenge. Once free he seeks his revenge.If you don't mind a challenge then the Count Of Monte Cristo is for you. This tale of adventure, vengence, and romance is one all should read."
4,OK,The device did exactly what I bought it for. It worked OK. The amplifier performed as expected. I liked it.
1,Nothing different -- Money down the drain,"Bought two of these based on reviews, which I now see was an inappropriate measure as the units are useless. Picked up nothing different-new than before, with the only difference being that I lost five of the twenty-four stations I was picking up from my outdoor antenna before installation.Junk."
3,Almost impressive.,"Helped with a few TV channels but the real thing was the great FM (anyone ever heard of FM Radio) reception. I have a old school Sansui reciever 1970's era, and this thing doubles the reception DB's on it. As for a tv doing better..... Not so much."
2,Didn't work well for DTV signals,Wanted to split my DTV Antenna signal to go to another DTV in the house. Barely made any difference at all only allowing reception of a few of the stronger DTV channel signals on the second DTV and no difference on the orignally connected DTV.
4,Item as Described,"10db gain. Improved the HDTV air signal reception. Using plain 46"" rabbitears, 25mi from towers, get 4 more channels, still need to adjust the rabbitears for a couple different channels, but not nearly as much as before, could probably use a little more gain to fix that completely, but made an improvement for me anyway."
1,Does not work (for me),"This product reduced my signal. I used it for a week, adjusting my antenna only to loose signal strength and channels. Once I disconnected the unit my signal strenght increased and I received more channels."
1,Low db cable signal booster,"The RCA 10db cable signal booster didn't have the strengh to maximize my cable TV picture quality. 10db is low but the big problem was it doesn't have a return path. This is needed so the cable company can talk to your digital box, but w/out return path the digital box is unable to talk back, (send information back to cable company). Did order 18db cable signal booster with return path, thank you."
2,Thumbs down,The first time I watched these years agoI liked them. Today they seem a little outdated??Just did not enjoy them really. Thumbs down.
4,Mission Impossible,"The first movie is better than the rest. But, my son loves them and that's what counts."
3,Harmless fluff for a light read,"I didn't really dislike this book, but this isn't a ""keeper"" and not one I would re-read. The ghost aspect of this book was pretty silly. I have read other ""ghost"" romances, and those were redeemed by having some humor in them, but this one didn't. I also was disappointed that more wasn't made of the issue of the friendship between the hero and the heroine's brother, and how the death of the brother affected both of them. I didn't feel like I really got ""into the heads"" of the main characters enough to grow to care for them--too much time was spent on traipsing all over the house for the disappearing ghosts. This book is like cotton candy--you can read it through once if you don't have anything better to do, but it doesn't satisfy for very long. I think that the author probably could do a lot better. Her writing was good, but the plot and characters weren't very well-developed."
4,epilator,"Purchased this product but it doesn't have 220 volts capability so useless while i travelled to india, it works fine, but had to purchase an additional adatoper and made it useless till the time had it. otherwise overall it is good"
5,What a great single!,"While I rarely find remixes not annoying, much less good, both remixes here are fabulous. I particularly like the Baxendale mix, which makes the title track sound very much like, well, Baxendale, who are another great band. Anyway, the real key to why you should buy this is the awesome b-side ""Buying Records Won't Make Me Feel Better"". Its a slow song with lyrics which I've found to be all too true. But, I must confess that buying this CD did make me feel a bit happier."
1,Waste of Money and Time,"As part of my job, I read this book because I had heard so much about it. It was not only a disappointment, but also a waste of my time. I could not believe the drivel it contained. The writing is so poor that the text is actually difficult to follow, and, to top it all off, the concepts are so trite, hackneyed and saccharine that following the text yields nothing. No insight, no information, no enhanced awareness. Nothing. I am at a loss to explain the good word of mouth this paperback has received except to suggest that perhaps the people who order it for prisoners don't actually read it before ordering. It's a waste of paper, newsprint and glue."
5,our favorite doll,"I purchased this doll for my 18 month old daughter 2 years ago after looking around for a while. This doll is just the perfect size to tote around and has a really sweet face and nice vanilla smell. ""Nilla baby"" was recently lost on a trip and, despite having about 15 other dolls, we had to buy a replacement to put under the Christmas tree (she actually sat on Santa's lap and told him she wanted Nilla baby home for Christmas because she was ""really worried about her""). So now we own #2."
3,drawer organizer,Slide out section does not attach making it easier for it to slide around inside the drawer. All else is fine.
3,Too tall for my drawer,"I like the organizer, but I didn't check how deep my middle desk drawer was and it's too tall, so if you are considering this for a desk, measure before you order. Otherwise, it's ok."
3,No dimensions?,"The description has adjustable width and ""depth"" (which in English means top-to-bottom""). 16"" deep would be a waste basket not a drawer organizer. How about length, width, and depth (height)?"
5,It does not get much better or more concise than this!,"Nothing I write will come close to the appropriate praise that this little book deserves. Michael Himes, a professor of theology at Boston College, known for his excellent video series from which this book was derived, does an amazing job at summarizing the essential elements of what it means to be part of the Catholic Christian community.This is as fun a book to read as it is informative. Having looked at many ""Introductions to Catholicism"" in order to better recommend particular books to inquirers, I would not hesitate to endorse this book."
5,"An eye-opening, powerful work","So often we stereotype autistics as being very limited in their ability to do basic functions of daily life. While this is true of some autistics, this book reveals that autism is not a single,universal condition, but a spectrum with a wide range of abilities as well as disabilities (the book's editor, who is autistic, is a college instructor). This book opens both the mind and the heart, enlightening readers about the variety of people who fall under the umbrella ""autistic""."
3,Nicely written and interesting to read,Nicely illustrated and easy to read. I often enjoy only the plates in art history books however I found the text interesting as well in this book.
1,Poor quality,The stickers came off within two months of use. They peel off easily and move too much for my taste.
3,"My Favorite ""Intellectual"" Read","Great writing, refreshingly intellectual, yet clear. Makes me think. An excellent break from the novels that make up the majority of my reading materials."
4,Bat'riffic,This is one of many albums made in the late sixties to cash in on the Batman tv show craze.It has some great action music that remind's me of many tv spy and cop show's like Man From U.N.C.L.E. and I Spy.If your a fan of these show's you will enjoy this music.
3,Better off buying the workbooks,"I bought this Kaplan SAT book, and their verbal and math workbooks for the SAT. In comparison, I would buy the 2 workbooks over this book. I feel like I have learned more strategies, which were also more clearly presented, and got better examples from the combination of those two books, than what I learned from this book. Also, the scales for the practice tests aren't true to a real SAT."
5,Best SAT prep EVER,"If you don't believe me, then listen to this true story:I got this book in the mail 2 days before my SAT exam. The day before the exam, I decided to read the verbal section, and then when I did a practice SAT, my verbal score jumped 100 points from 630 to 730. Amazing, non?"
4,Good hearted 80s coming-of-age mini-classic,"Sweet, unabashedly sentimental coming of age tale, set in a resort the Catskills mountains- an area that was once the summer get away for upper-middle class Jewish families fromall over the New York area.The dancing is hot, the acting is a mix (Grey and Orbach are very good, Swayze tries hard,looks great, but is a better dancer than actor ).The ending feels very Hollywood, which is too bad, because the film seemed to promisemore complexity in its gently satirical look at early 60s America in the first half.Plus some very creaky, cliche sub-plots start to invade the film as well.Yet the story is told with an honest and good heart, and there's a reason it's becomea mini-classic. Do I think it's a great movie? No. But can I understand why ageneration that grew up with it cherish it as a wonderful coming of age fantasy?Absolutely."
3,Classic,"Bought for my wife for Easter. Classic movie. However I didn't notice a big difference with this Blu-Ray compared to regular DVD. If you like this movie, I would recommend for the price."
4,Finally the edition fans have waited for...,"What child of the 80s doesn't remember Johnny pulling Baby out of that corner and letting the whole world know that real men do dance?! Well, we can all breath a sigh of relief because the wonderful people over at Lionsgate have finally put out a version that includes lots and lots of extras including deleted scenes, alternate scenes, extended scenes, outtakes plus more that haven't been included in any edition before. My only complaint is that they left out Dirty Dancing Live in Concert...which means I'll probably hang onto my Ultimate version but nonetheless I'm thrilled with the new extras. If you loved this movie 20 years ago, be sure to pick it up for the next 20."
5,I WIN!,"I finally did it. I got him to watch a chick flick. Despite Mr. Bronson's constants groans of pain and disgust, he watched the whole thing (and survived!). This is one of my favorite movies of all time so it really meant a lot that I was able to share it with him. After 7 months of horror flicks, a little change was nice (i love you honey).There's not much I can say about this movie that someone else hasn't already written. I love the music, the dancing is awesome, and the story is well written. For the longest time, I'd always cry at the end of the movie because, gosh darn it, I wanted my happy ending! Finding it (my happy ending) with Mr. Bronson made me look at it in a completely different way.I'm done be mushy, I promise! I'm making myself sick with the immense sappiness of it all."
5,INCREDIBLE,"NEVER HAVE I SEEN A MOVIE THAT IS FILLED WITH AS MUCH ""STUFF"" AS THIS ONE. i WILL NEVER FORGET THIS MOVIE, IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST i HAVE SEEN"
3,Gotta love it,"My review is actually about the DVD itself, not so much the movie. The movie, if anyone reading this has actually not seen it (!), is so bad its great! There are so many things to love about this movie, from the dialogue (bad but campy) to the acting (acceptable) to the plot (nostalgic) to the dancing (great) to the love story (somewhat engaging) etc. etc.The DVD itself, however, is supposed to contain additional scenes and material that the avid fan of this movie could not be too excited about. Well, perhaps my expectations were too high, but I expected outtakes and interviews that just did not exist. The bios I can get anywhere, and the additional scenes I had seen before. There is nothing added to this DVD that makes it ""collectible"". The movie itself is enough!"
2,"""Some people count, and some don't""","The stab at Ayn Rand was the only really enjoyable part of this movie. The rest is just flatulance. The songs were good, but wouldn't you agree that they were a little too 80s to be part of the early 1960s? Jennifer Grey is believable as the love-struck adolescent; everyone else is so-so. If you want a good Patrick Swayze film, see ""Ghost."""
3,"This movie is better than ""Planet of the Apes""","I can still remember the first time I saw Dirty Dancing. It was just after I watched my favorite movie ""Planet of the Apes"" for the 27th time. It wasn't nearly as good, but the part where Baby dances with Martin and Johnny gets mad is funny. I also enjoyed the scene where Lisa is kissing Brian and her boyfriend Chris walks in. Whew! What a predicament. You should buy this movie. It's pretty good."
1,Non-working DVD,"I received my Dirty Dancing Keepsake edition DVD in a timely manner. Since I was busy with my job, I didn't get to view it right away. When I did play it on my laptop, only the 2nd DVD would play, the one with all the interviews and information on how they made the movie, etc. I then went to play the actual movie and it would not play on my laptop. When I got home that night, I put the DVD in my TV/DVD player. Sure enough it would not play in that machine either.As of this writing, this issue has not yet been resolved with Amazon. I have purchased many movies through Amazon and this is the first time I've ever run into a problem like this. Hopefully my Keepsake edition will be replaced soon and at no cost to me. Time will tell whether I purchase future movies at Amazon."
5,Review for Dirty Dancing,"This movie is a classic, and it was great to see it in the blu-ray format. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is a fan of this movie. It would also make a great gift idea."
5,60's or 80's,This has got to be one of the most 50ish value movies with the most 80's soundtrak which makes it double great. I love and you will too. What girl wouldn't love to be swept off her feet by Patrick Swayze and in thos pants at that!! WOW!!
5,From the 80's,"Dirty Dancing is one of my favorite movies. Its a lot like Grease. I don't know which one I like better. It has great songs, great acting, and great dancing. Thats probably why they named it Dirty DANCING. It is very fun to watch and you could never get sick of it. This is one movie that will live on."
3,Eh boring till the end.,"When I watched this movie for the first time I thought it was just another ordinary movie. Nothing really interested me; the dancing, the love story, and the couple problems did not stop me from leaving the television set to do something else. It was not till the end of the movie till I started to enjoy it. The dancing scene at the end was probably the best part. The music and the dancing just made me want to get up and dance. Overall it was an alright movie which had a great ending."
3,Use Good Judgement,"This movie should be previewed by parents before even considering letting your children (teens and NO younger) watch it if you are the least bit concerned about the influences of its content affecting the moral character of your child. Good acting, several scenes could have been left out and still had a good story to tell."
2,very average&overrated,this film was okay but by no means worthy of all the hype.Jennifer Gray is a weak actress.as for Patrick Swayze he is a 2nd tier dancing John Travolta knock off.catchy but nothing that merits all the Love it got.
2,Summing up the plotline:,"Basically, a nice, wholesome girl from a good, caring family looses her virginity to a male prostitute, helps a female prostitute get an illegal abortion (which almost kills her) then WONDERS and is ANGRY about why her father is worried about her and doesn't want her going near the aforementioned people.Well duh.....The soundtrack is decent; I suppose that's worth another star"
1,nomad,I ordered DVD Dirty Dancing expecting it to be used in Uk and find it is not compatible with UK player although purchased in GBP
1,not what i ordered,"i ordered the ""dirty dancing"" dvd, the description online said it was the fullscreen version. when it arrived it was the widescreen version. i do not care for movies in the widescreen. i have checked back since i got my order and it is still being advertised as the ""fullscreen version. i love the movie and always have, that's why i ordered it in dvd. i really think it should be advertised as it really is so other people don't get the wrong product like i did"
1,"I love this movie, but the streaming was unsuccessful.","Had a big problem streaming the video. The video would get stuck every few minutes. We didn't even get to finish watching the movie, which stinks, because I paid $1.99 to watch it. :-("
5,Loved it,I hadn't seen this movie until now and loved it. Now I know what everyone is talking about when they reference it.
5,This movie changed my life when I was a kid.,"One reviewer put down this movie because of its ""relative morality"". The thing is, Baby wasn't underage (I think the reviewer said she was 16). Her dad says that she is going off to college in the fall, so you should assume that she is 18. Anyway, while the music and dancing are fun, that is not what this movie is about to me. Its about Baby's coming of age. There are a lot of deep interactions between people here."
5,Brillient!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dirty Dancing is my all time favourate movie, I first saw it when I was about 5 years old(even though i shouldn't have done!), and later on I decided to buy it, It has a great story line which deals with very serious situations. Patrick Swayze is a brillient dancer and absalutely gorgeous!!!!!!! Jennifer Grey is also very good as Baby. I recomend this film to anyone who loves a good old fashioned love story or even if you don't your'll still love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Kitten's Thought's on the Dirty Dancing,I first saw bits and pieces of the movie but i fell in love with the movie. Then i could not figure out what the movie was called. So i spent about 6 months trying to figure out what it was called. So i finally figured it out and i went out and bought it. When i got home i put it in and watched the whole thing for the first time. It made me feel kind of mushy inside. Then i watched it over and over again. I must have watched it about 40 times that night. I think that it is the best movie i have ever watched in my life i havent yet found a better movie. I think that is the best movie in my whole house.
4,Dirty Dancing,The dancing and the music overshadow the well-worn storyline in the classic Patrick Dempsey flick. A movie to be enjoyed over and over again for the dancing and the music.
5,"Still a Favorite, After All These Years!","The energy, music, dancing and scenery--not to mention the chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey--have made this movie one that still makes me laugh and makes me cry. It's a ""feel good"" movie to watch again and again."
5,Worth waiting for,"The entire family Stewart loved "" Dirty Dancing"" when it hit the UK cinemas. Since those days, we've played the CDs incessantly and watched and watched the video, in widescreen. We couldn't wait to see the DVD version ( We pre-ordered for safety) and now we have it we can savour it all over again and again with a myriad of extras due to the capability of the new format, in perfect audio and video. My suggestion ? - BUY!!!"
5,"A great glimpse of the now played-out ""Titanic"" Syndrome","I loved this movie. I saw this not too long ago. I had seen the movoie Titanic and thought ""poor boy meets rich girl, how cozy."" But now I see where the inspiration was! The movies music makes you want to dance, and the coreograpy makes you could dance like that with Patrick Swayze. I loved it and I give it 5 stars."
5,Love my Dirty Dancing DVD,"This limited edition Dirty Dancing Keepsake DVD collection is a must for all fans of this movie. It has not only the movie but lots of additional footage, interviews, and even screen tests of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey."
4,Great Movie but the Special DVD features aren't that special,"This is an awesome movie, but I held out buying the original DVD until they came out with a Collector's Edition DVD with special features.As it turns out, I was somewhat disappointed by the special features. The commentary was good, but the featurette was only about 7 minutes long. Also, the 3 music videos were pretty bad quality (I am sure they were transferred off of tape that was about 15 years old). Also, the musical didn't really hold my interest. However, this DVD has so many extra features that if you only like half of them, that is still quite a bit."
3,"OK, but I was expecting the extra scenes","Don't be fooled - this version does not have the additional scenes that have been showing when this movie plays on TV. That's the main reason why I ordered the movie, but I'm disappointed. Also, the color is dark, not bright and crisp like others have said. Oh, well."
5,Who doesn't love this film?,"Great blooper in the movie. The scene where Cynthia Rhodes, is training Baby with Patrick Swayze in his room. Cynthia picks up the tone arm, and places it on the record, immediately puts the tone arm back onto its holder, and the song Hungry Eyes starts. The needle never touched the record!"
5,Great CD!,The CD was in great shape and played well. I was very happy with it as well as the service I received. It arrived exactly when expected.
1,Color is way off on Blu-ray,"I have a Samsung Blu-Ray, and the BR disc of the 20th Anniversary version of Dirty Dancing. The picture quality of the movie is just awful, particularly on the indoor scenes. Faces and backgrounds were almost fuchsia, almost always. I did not adjust my TV color, since all of the ""extras"", including extended scenes, outtakes, and deleted scenes were perfect quality. What a pity. My first BR disc purchase and such a disappointment. The manufacturer should be ashamed.Dirty Dancing (20th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]"
1,Nothing but trouble,I think the title is enough said but never received movie and no contact to refund or fix the problem until i filed claim with amazon!
1,**** never received this dvd from amazon,"On 4/13/09 I ordered 2 dvds (Flashdance and Dirty Dancing). I received Flashdance almost immediately, but to this day, I have never received Dirty Dancing. I just received my bank statement this week and Amazon withdrew funds for both movies (Flashdance - $6.43 / Dirty Dancing - $22.94) on 4/14/09. Please help me straighten this out.Laurie Mobilia"
1,baaaddd!!!!,"""Nobody puts babay in a corner."" That one line doomed an already bad film to the garbage heap."
1,Over over overated,"I must be one of the few people on the face of the planet that can't stand this movie. I don't care about that fact either because nothing could convince me to put up with this boring old movie again. I had the misfortune of seeing this some time ago, and even more misfortune of seeing the stage show. Boring. I'd rather pull my eyelashes out one by one or something equally as torturous. I know I'm not going to convince many people about this mundane tired movie, but I feel better having said my peice and maybe I could save someone from the pain."
3,Corny movie,"This is one of the worst chick flicks ever. This movie cameout in the late 80's and did fit with the time period, butnow feels so corny and lame. The plot, the acting, and justabout everything. Patrick Swayze always was an overratedactor, and how can you like Jennifer Grey? She seems likea big time whiney snob. The soundtrack helped improve themovie but couldn't save the cheese that this movie reaked.Honestly, the 80's was a cheesy decade and movies like thisand Footloose helped make that so. If you are young you shouldreally pass on these type of movies because they are lame andcheesy despite the good soundtracks."
5,Unbelivable!,"I have always loved this movie and when I decided to buy this DVD I didn't expect to get the movie, music videos, concert, how the movie was made and lots of other things! It is truly collector's edition.The movie itself is a beautiful love story with a girl and a boy which we can all be. I think it wakes the best in us.And one more important thing: after this movie you'll go to dancing lessons, definetly!"
5,Best DVD I have ever seen,I have been a fan of Dirty dancing for a long time . I have it on VHS but I bought it on DVD because I wanted to feel the music. What I saw on the DVD is beyond my expectations. I don't mind borowing movies to my friends but this one is staying home. It is too good!!!The movie seemd like a totaly new movie. I love it!!!
5,Wow!,What's not to love? I'm so glad to have one of my favorite movies in DVD. The anniversry edition is just a bonus.
5,Where is Patrick?,I certainly enjoyed watching Dirty Dancing over. The special features are nice. Lots of memory. The only thing is there are no interview with Patrick Swayze...really strange...
4,Classic,It's a classic movie and this is by far the best place to find movies like this one!!! just perfect!
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,"I always thought this was a lame movie, but I really love it now that I've seen it. Yes, it IS a chick-flick, so if you don't like those types of movies, don't buy it."
4,definitely a keeper :),"Dirty Dancing was always one of my favorites, so I was thrilled when I saw they made a special edition with extra features after Patrick Swayze passed away!! The product arrived quickly and was in great condition!"
2,Limited Edition Keepsake,"Beware!!!! If you are a 'Dirty Dancing' fan you will realize this edition has some scenes that are missing from the original movie. I'm extremely disappointed in this DVD. I tried to find the edition that had all the scenes, knowing there was one like this out there. No one stated in the reviews that the movie had been edited. I watch this one anyway just because I don't want to take a chance on ordering another one and have the same thing happen again. I would gladly pay the money for a complete movie, but no one seems to state this in the reviews. Order a different version!!!"
4,Dirty Dancing,Very good movie enjoyed it as much as original which came out several years ago. Would recommend it to all.
5,Hopelessly Romantic Feel Good Movie,"A romantic novel with pictures. Its not a 'deep' movie, nor do I believe it was supposed to be. Its just a feel good movie for us hopeless romantics...much like 'Pretty Woman' was. I would love to see a director 'pair' Gray & Swayze together again...maybe a return visit to 'Kellermans' with the rest of the cast."
5,Wonderful,"This is a movie that I have always wanted to see. Not only is the movie entertaining to watch, but it also has an excellent story line. I would highly recommend it."
1,Puke,"Okay, now you know my alltime unfavorite 80's movie. Sure its set in the early 60's - then tell me why the hell are they dancing to 80's songs? I almost shelved Patrick Swayze after this one but he was redeemed by Roadhouse. This movie could only be enjoyed by a pack of prepublescent girls at a slumber party who are wondering what its like to lose their virginity. And am I the only one who thinks that Jennifer Gray is a total dog? Sure she's got a hot body but that face! UGGG! That is the one thing that kept this movie from scorring with the guys in my opinion. Skip it, rent roadhouse instead. Better plot, better chicks!"
2,dirty dancing,i was disappointed ... i wanted widescreen presentation... i got full screen... very very angry of you.... the box said widescreen movie.. the best way to see any movie... i love this movie ..
2,Extremely overated with mediocre dancing...,If you've ever seen any truly inspired or exuberant dancing you'll find this film very run of the mill. The script is very predictable with characters that aren't particulary sympathic or endearing.To see some good dancing check out 'Dance with Me' with Chayanne and Vanessa Williams.
5,movie,I love watching Dirty Dancing. I loved Patrick Swayze in this movie and will miss him. My daughter and I love this movie.
5,I have an OCD with this movie!,"Yes I am a psycho, and yes I love this movie! It is THE BEST thing since sliced bread...and pizza. It reminds me of the good ol' days when I looked Jennifer Grey. I miss those days. And for awhile I even looked Patrick Swayze. But now, I just look like Neil. Watch this movie because it's really good and you'll just want get up and D-A-N-C-E...dance!"
2,The crazy Swayze film career,"Patrick Swayze has appeared in a number of worthwhile movies and some corny ones, too. Swayze's two biggest pictures fall in that corny category - GHOST and, of course, DIRTY DANCING. Fans who like the actor in such silliness should take a look at his better films, including POINT BREAK, THE OUTSIDERS and ROADHOUSE, even if Ben Gazzarra upstaged him the latter."
5,Excellent Children's Book,This is a fun and educational book with great illustrations. A must-have for your child's library.
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book. Grey's life didn't really start until about 11 in the story and then was basically skimmed over till she went to the monastery and that was all about ""pleasing a few monks"" I didn't finish it. I stopped reading about the time she was going to leave the monastery. Quite graphic & crude sex terms."
1,Voice synthesis is very bad,"Don't buy this if you are looking for a translator that pronounces (speaks) words. It sounds like early 1980's computer voice synthesizers and the result is very poor. Enligh is my first language, and it is difficult for me to understand the English words it speaks. Some of the words, I could only understand because I was looking at the written word on the screen at the same time I was listening to the spoken word. When I tried the French words on several native French-speaking people, it was difficult for them as well. It does written translations OK. The user interface is a little bit awkward and not very intuitive."
2,decent movie,Old movie so the quality is poor but it is informative about the llfe of Handel. I would play it on something other than a computer to improve quality a bit.
4,bra can sing!,"from first hearing this cd i knew this cat was on to somthing,the lyrics were a little heavy for me on a few songs,but,there was a large variety so i was satisfied. thanks jovan my girl loves it to she always sings you dont have to cry. this is a must buy cd got to have it."
5,Sexy!,I first heard of Jovan through a friend of mine who told me I had to get his album. I just purchased it a few days ago and it is already on the top of my list of favorites. It is a MASTERPIECE! The music is very classy and the words take you to a whole new level. His music is sexy and his writing is mature and thoughful. For Brian McKnight and Eric Benet fans: Watch out. There is a new treasure in Soul/R&B: JOVAN!
4,Great Record,"One of the best R&B albums of the year. U Got It Bad, U Turn and Help Me particularly stand out."
4,GOOD!,This iz a good album!I liked the first single but then it got very annoying!Y?Because the radio stations and tv stations kept on playing the song!VERY ANNOYING!But the song iz great!
5,U Cant Shush Usher u Citics!,"Usher has an ego which is truly shown in this Album andis well worth havin in your cd player!01 intro lude no point listenin 2 really!02 U know the song ""U remind me"" this will get u in the mood 4 the rest of his album!!03 feat.

Skip em!10 ok short an sweet!11 yes this is gud an shud be placed further up the albumSack the rest of the album unless u r bored and feel like explorin songs that aint goodOh TTP is gud listen 2 that its 16!"
1,Did I hear what I think I did?,"What the hell? What is it with everyone saying N*****? It does not look good, it's vulgar, and offensive. I hope that artists stop saying it. I don't think that Usher needs to use that word to make good music."
3,usher,"this cd isn't anything special. I like usher and all but this cd starts to get on your nerves after a while. It has some good songs such as:I don't know- the beat is nice but usher's voice isn't right for the beat.you got it bad- this is a great song and in my opinion the best song on the cd.If i want to- Usher comes of a little cocky in this song, but this still a great songu dont have to call- this is a good continuation of you got it bad and this is one of the better songs on the album.other than these songs the cd is pretty bland. On most of the song's Usher's beats don't got well with his voice. He could have done much better on this cd and i wouldn't advise anyone to buy it. You'd be better of to download it because it's not worth the money."
4,Usher Holds His Own.,"With Tyrese's ""2000 Watts"" dimming on the charts and the cherry bomb that was Sisqo's last album, the only twentysomething male vocalist in mainstream r&b that seems to matter is Usher Raymond (with a special mention, of course, to Donnell Jones). As far as modern r&b records go, ""8701"" is a surprisingly good, tight groove that overall stays consistent throughout the ride. You know the hits: ""U Remind Me,"" ""U Got it Bad,"" and ""U Don't Have to Call,"" but the rest of the disc is filled with smokin' cuts. The best of the bunch is the head-bobbingly delicious ""I Don't Know,"" a jam so good, you don't mind P.Diddy's cameo. ""8701"" isn't perfect, with only a couple of subpar tunes, but for your money, this album gives you mucho bang for your buck and earns a B+ in my school of music."
5,You will like this CD too,"This CD was given to me as a present. I wasnt a fan before, but now I truly love his music. It is smooth, has a beat, expresses emotions once in awhile but is never depressing. In fact, it is such a feel good CD, I recommended it to friends. Dont think twice. Buy it."
4,GREAT CONTEMPORARY R&B ALBUM,"Usher's 8701 is the album that confirms that he is one of the superstars of the overcrowded R&B genre.Like his previous album,he displays his sex appeal on tracks such as ""Twork It Out"".He gives his best performances on ""U Remind Me"",""U Don't Have To Call""(Both songs won a Grammy Award) but ""Can You Help Me?"" is the real showstopper on the album.Some songs are also pleasant to listen to,such as the sultry""How Do I Say?"" and the break-up song""Separated"". A worthwhile album."
1,"late and later, no show","I ordered this cd Dec 8th 2009 and have not recieved this at all, the seller is at fault and I'll never buy from them again!!!! VSH"
3,"""U Remind Me""","I bought this CD for the sole purpose of having the single ""U Remind Me"". This song is awesome and a lot of people can relate to it. I wasn't too impressed with all the other tracks on it though. They were all kind of weak and just didn't have same quality as the single. However, the song with P Diddy wasn't too bad, just could have been done better. Also, the track ""Twork It Out"" kind of makes you want to get your freak on. In short, I wouldn't have bought this CD if his single wasn't always sold out in stores, but the song ""U Remind Me"" is tight so I guess it was worth it."
2,It Doesn't Have Soul.,"I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it."
5,Buy THIS version (import),"The difference is that there are 3 different songs: Track 6. pop ya collar; 16.TTP and 17. SeparatedThe US version has U R the one for track 15.The most important reason to buy this one is for the song ""separated"". One of Usher's best songs ever. You can't find this song on iTunes."
4,Very Good album,"8701 the cd title, tell us the year when little Usher started singing, in 1987 up to the realease of this album where we can find a whole new mature Usher in it, in 2001.I bought the album because I love the first to singles, ""U remind me"" and ""U got it bad"" however I found some other great songs like ""I don't know"" (feat P.Diddy) ""If I want to"" ""I can let you go"" or ""U R the one"", all of them have great beats and are relly catchy. Also there is another great ballad apart from ""U got it bad"" that is ""Can you help me"", and please, don't skip the interlude because is a great beginning for that song.Other two reasons to buy the CD is Usher's voice that is great in every song and the enhanced CD.Go and buy it!"
4,R & B defined by Usher,"Not a bad album. After hearing some of the songs, it's evident this is a typical R & B album. Of course, if you like Usher, that's what you'd expect. ""U Remind Me"" is a great song, no matter where you hear it. The rest of the CD features a mesh of classic R & B (""Twork it out, ""U got it bad""), sappy romantic ballads (""Can U help me""), a hot Latin party-scene beat (""How do I say""), and a new-wave rap (""If I want to"", ""I can't let u go"", ""U r the one""). I personally prefer the faster stuff, but to those who like slow and smooth R & B, don't hesitate to listen to this 8701."
4,Usher is Back (with some experimentation),"This CD takes a little getting used to. The single ""U Remind Me"" and the fast tracks ""If I want To"", ""I Can't Let U Go"" and ""Good Ol' Ghetto"" are really tight - they grab you on the first listen because they are so catchy and unique. However, there were some songs I was not too impressed with on my first listen, but with time they grew on me, such as ""U R The One."" I don't really like ""U Got It Bad"" or ""You Don't Have to Call"" - I find them too slow. There is a good mix of slow songs and fast ones - personally I prefer the fast ones. Give this CD a chance - it's worth the money. The slow jam ""Can you Help Me"" is really sweet. By the way, Usher has also grown vocally - he sounds more soulful. And you probably don't care, but I also recommend Craig David's Born to Do It and (unrelated) the Backstreet Boys'Millenium and Black and Blue as albums that you can listen to from start to finish like Usher."
3,It's not what I expected from Usher,"It's a good album, but I thought he could have done a little better, I have his first two albums and they were fabulous. I like some of the songs on his new one, but still I think he could have done better."
5,Crystal Jordans Review,"My name is Crystal Jordan and I attend Albemarle Middle School(Home of the BULLDOGS).Well Usher I think that your albulm 8701 is off the chins.Eva since the song U Remind Me came out, I have really been felling that.If this is not to much to ask you,Would you come to my school in Albemarle to talk to the students about how drugs are very bad for your body.Well my words are getting shorso GOTS TO BOUNCE. HALLA.Love your #1 fan Crystal Jordan."
5,NICEEEEEEEEEEEE.,I LOVE THIS CD AND ITS GREAT ITS OFF THE CHAIN. I LIKE THE WAY ALL HIS SONGS ARE DIFFERRNT AND HOW NONE OF THEM ARE THE SAME. I LIKE THAT. IF U LIKE USHER U'LL LIKE THIS CD. GREAT JOB.
5,We LUV USHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"right now me and my friend r listening 2 the cd and it is the very best!!!!!!!All 15 songs r awesome!!!!!!! especially can u help me, my friend luvs twork it out and u-turn and u got it bad and. . .ALL OF THEM!!!!!!!Usher swears a little but dont most people?His songs r really great, they all hav great lyrics and r fun 2 dance 2!!! Especially the slow songs!!!!"
4,hmmm wheres separated tho?,the only thing bad about this cd is that it doesnt include separated which i think is his best ballad ever...find it on the net its a great song!
3,I almost did not buy this album,"Mainly because the radio kept playing U Remind me, U got it bad or U don't have to call and I was sick of hearing those songs. Then I bought the album and played track U R the One, U-Turn and I can't let you go. I like a few more songs, but I don't play track 2, 5 or 8 at all."
4,usher was creative then,now THIS is the usher I liked who actually released good music instead of that stale let it burn and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. He was on fiyah in summer 2001 till 2002 with his blazing hot videos and being himself with a little bit of michael jackson influence instead of trying to be his minime like he does all the time today and not even be close to dancing as great.
4,Usher Is At It Again!!!!,Usher has never let me down with his CD's. He is the only R&B; male artist that I can listen to and not skip through the songs.The production on this one is.....on point and on top of it's game!!! The Neptunes come through on the tracks that they produce. J.D. comes through with his part also.The lyrics are good and the Babyface produced songs are really good and soulful. I recommend fans of R&B; and Hip Hop alike to get this one...it's really good. Peace out folks!!!
2,2.5 Actually...,"This CD is 2.5 stars actually. Anyway, I was VERY dissapointed at this CD! I listened to the 30 second sound clips and thought 'Hey, what a great album' but when I went to Wal-Mart, got it, and then listened to it, I thought 'blah'. Usher sounds like Eminem! (Not a compliment by the way) His music is just...blah. The only good parts of the songs are in the middle but by then you are SO frustrated by the beginning of the song, you already skipped the song. I wish I could return this CD and get my money back but sadly, I can't. Ugh."
3,Yahoo,This is possitively genious...Everything glitters...The price was even DYNOMITE...You'd be the biggest retardnot to want this....That's the bottom line
4,Finally a CD with real music!!!!,"Its about time Usher released another cd. This cd is great, but is missing a couple of tracks that were suppose to be on the original version of this album. Unfortunately since they got on to [a downloaded site], he delayed the cd and took those tracks off. If those tracks were still on, i'd give it 5 stars. But if you want a good R&B/Hip-hop album, that isn't like all the other so-called R&B today, then get this cd. ...."
1,Disapointed,"I usually love Usher. 3 of his songs were good ( U got it Bad, U Remind Me, and I Don't Know) but I've heard those 3 songs a thousand times and I didn't feel like listening to them again. I got this for Christmas and yes I did suffer through the whole cd, trying to keep and open mind but the rest of the CD was bad. Now I remember why I stopped buying cds."
5,This is the best cd I have ever bought!,"This is such a good cd, i couldn't stop listening to songs on it like: ""U Got It Bad"" and ""I Don't Know"". I like how Usher mixed in a lot of slow songs with fast ones. He did an OK job on ""My Way"", but there is no way he can top this cd.This is a definite buy for anyone who likes the songs ""U Remind Me"" and ""U Got It Bad"". Even if you don't, then you should still listen to this cd ALL THE WAY THROUGH a couple of times.If anybody, and i mean anybody, says that 8701 is not the best cd they have ever heard, than they can go to hell.BUY IT NOW!"
3,Pretty good,"This CD was alright if you ask me. I dont think the production really fit Usher on some songs. even though there was some bad there was also some really good, like the obvious ""U Got It Bad"" and ""U Dont Have To Call"". some other good songs are ""U REmind Me"" and ""Can U Help Me"". on these songs Usher sings charismatically with great songs and production. this was an okay Cdand Confessions is way better, R&B and Usher fans should still cop this CD."
5,itz a very good album!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ushers best album,ITS MUCH BETTER THEN CONFESSIONS!!!!!!!!!!!CUZ U HAVE 2 SKIP SO MANY TRACKS ON CONFESSIONZ.....GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!
3,Expecting good result in my breeding Cockatiels,I don't know how the product works. One day my birds starting mating and the next day I started using the product. Today is just day two that I have used it. I will write more after eggs hatched.
2,Only got one bowl!,"Only one of the four bowls got delivered to me and by the time I got online to complain, this item was no longer in stock and it was more trouble to return it than to settle for 1/4 of the product I paid full price for... Such a shame too, as i do so love that one bowl!"
5,GREAT MEMORIES,"bEAUTIFUL FILM QUALITY FROM THE ""GOLDEN AGE OF HOLLYWOOD"" WELL WORTH THE TIME AND MONEY TO ENJOY."
3,Why not more stereo?,"Been looking forward to a ""Girl Crazy"" DVD for years, but I'm disappointed that only one number will be issued in stereo. I recorded the film off the air years ago and replaced the soundtrack of all the numbers with the stereo versions from the Rhino CD, and it's amazing! Watching this film with all the numbers in stereo is really a joy - why couldn't WB Video have done the same thing and given us the option of watching it in stereo or mono? A big missed opportunity."
5,Amazing Collection!,"This is an amazing collection! I bought this set for the movies, and I am thrilled.The extra nice surprise- I was completely blown away by the huge amount of extras. Each dvd comes with loads of special features- commentaries, interviews, lots more (two pages of extras per film), and even old newsreel footage. I haven't even looked at the ""extra"" special features dvd that came with the set yet. It also came with a hardcover book with info about the films and the actors, and great images of behind the scenes and all of the movie posters. Additionally- there was a folder with many photographs (like large, high-quality postcards), which are a treasure in themselves.I am so glad I bought this set- what a bargain! My whole family loves it."
4,Relics of the classic age,"MGM had great stars like Judy Garland. They had great music writers like the Gershwin brothers and others. They had great silky black and white photography, sharp as any DVD without the color. What they didn't have was great plots. These movies were little throwaways, a Saturday afternoon's entertainment meant to be changed every week. Babes on Broadway starts pretty well, and ends with a hideous blackface routine that is supposed to ""make"" the team of kids on Broadway. Times have changed."
1,"Garland, the true star.","Even Mickey Rooney has to admit that it was his privilege to work with Judy Garland. She is the authentic star. And what of the grandfinale of Girl Crazy? Stages by Busby Berkeley, musical direction by Roger Edens, orchestration by Conrad Salinger (these ar the names that matter), Garland sings the Gershwins' I Got Rhythm. A defining moment of popular music as it used to be written, and has long since gone wawy."
4,Only watched it for Ewan,"When I rented Nora from the video store, I was pleasantly suprised to find the first film I'd ever seen about James Joyce. If you like literature- such books as The Unbearable Lightness of Being, you would adore James Joyce's work. Nora, like the movie version of T.U.L.O.B lost some literary beauty (as all books-turned-movies do), but not so much that I lost total interest. I give it an A minus!"
4,Very interesting at times but .... sometimes disturbing,Truly it was a very good movie. Ewan McGregor one of my all-time favorite actors and veryyy goodlooking i might add was extremely good in this film. I think this film is for movie lovers because you have to really WATCH it not just try to watch it and be rather confused. My friend watched it with me and hated it and said I ruined her life for renting it. But I can watch the movies that are really boring to people. And I really liked this film. Ewan was so great in this and had a really strong presence and even though...and some of the love scenes disturb me to this day ..it was very good and well made ( well because Ewan made it of course!)
1,Don't Bother,A horrible movie which makes Dull & ordinary (with the exception of sex) one of the most complex writers/individuals that Ireland has produced. If cinematography alone is your sole requisite in a film by all means buy the DVD. One good aspect of the movie; Ewan & Susan Lynch's rendition of 'The Lass of Aughrim'...but you can download that.
1,ewan mcgregor's hot,"although ewan mcgregor is my ultimate favorite actor in the entire world..i have to say that this was a terrible movie. and yes..sadly, ewan co-produced it! <i don't why he would ever sign to be co-producer of THAT film..it should have been moulin rouge!> So back to the movie..I hated Susan Lynch in this film. has she ever heard of shaving? I know this is back in the day so I'll give her that much. But she was a little TOO hairy for me. This movie is really graphic and it shows a lot of uh..stuff. Ewan was so cute in it! But I think there could have been a better Nora picked. This is definitlely an erotic film like the actual overview says. the reason why i gave this film only 1 star is because it was so hard to follow! i figured out in the middle that time was jumping VERY fast. they should have dates as subtitles. It jumped ahead quickly, it was too graphic, and overall..it's probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. sorry ewan!!!"
2,Not so Good,"I bought this DVD. I didn't really like it. 1. It doesn't show the first part of the theme. Also, on each episode, it has the same credits at the end all the time. You wouldn't know who the guest stars were. It also doesn't include the real theme song. The picture wasn't so good, same with the sound. I did like the extras, but the 20 episodes weren't worth it. I reccommend you buy the ""Beverly Hillbillies Ultimate Collections"" volume 1 & 2.That has the theme song, real credits. Better quality."
4,BHillibillies02,Episodes were great. The music prelude was lousy. I would rather have heard the original music.
1,Beverly Hillbillies,Very rough video. Looks like it was taped off of someone's TV...Very noisy and blurry. Love the episodes but not the quality...
1,Don't be Deceived!,"Don't be fooled, this is a cheap public domain copy of Beverly Hillbillies episodes; hence they do not contain the original music (Ballad of Jed Clampett, etc). and the sound and picture quality are abyssmal, not to mention the product stamp on every frame of the disc. If you're a true affectionado of the Hillbillies try ""The Ultimate Collection"" discs as they were produced by the estate of Paul Henning the creator of the show. Only the first two volumes have been released and hopefully a company will release genuine episodes as opposed to these public domain ripoffs."
2,Just in case you didn't know what you were watching...,"""The Beverly Hillbillies Collection"" is plastered in the lower-right corner of the screen during the show.The Theme by Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs missing as well.What a shame."
4,GREAT FOR BUDGET,"Well as I said, great for a budget DVD set...We have had a few other BEVERLY HILLBILLIES on budget DVD's before and this is about as good as your going to get in this price range...However, they do leave out the original famous intro song...But I understand that might have been part of some type *Legal Agreement* to release as a budget set........BOB"
2,Rather poor quality,Sad to say the pictures are rather blur. Sound is ok.All my other DVDs from Amazon have better quality. Wonder why this one is so bad.
4,Contemplating,"Have been interested in starting an advocacy organization. This book is clearly written, appears to be authoritative and comes from a person who seems to care about the field. I finished the book mildly encouraged but with some respect for the complexities involved. Note that this is only about the legal issues of non profits, not ""managing"" non profits per se."
1,Why?,"I found this book useless. Very short, confusing explanations of product types and color guides. Everything is illustrated with pictures of her own products--do you want to pay money for an advertisement?The Bobbi Brown or Kevyn Aucoin books would be more helpful than this if you want to learn how to apply makeup."
5,Great read!,"I recently read this again. It's just as good a second time. Kaylin Neya is a complicated, interesting character in a well developed plot. The City is believable with its different races working together, most of the time. There is magic, but Kaylin doesn't really understand hers, nor anyone else's. Michelle West doesn't try to explain it all at once, which would bog the story down to a crawl. (Hear that, Stephen Lawhead?) the story draws you into her world and drives along at a fast clip. I love the book and am reading the second one in the series already!"
3,Good read not great,"I basicly liked this book. Some of the characters were interesting. The death of the children was a little hard to take sometimes. I never really got to like Kaylin. She just didn't seem real for some reason. If the author works a little more on Kaylin, makes her more likable, i mean she does care about the children and does heal them but something is missing."
4,Good story series,Interesting characters with good background stories. Good story progression. I would recommend this as a whole series for the adventure that it is.
3,"Check it out at the library, but don't take it home.","This was a very interesting book with detailed characters and a creative new world to explore. The biggest issue that I faced with this novel was that it was very confusing. Some of the explanations for things are unfathomable; I would find myself re-reading the section multiple times and still be unable to understand it. I think it's a very unique and different new world, but Sagara sometimes puts the reader on overload with too much information to absorb or understand at once. Having said this, it was an enjoyable read, but not something that I can see myself reading over and over again. Borrow it from a friend, or check it out at the library, but don't take it home expecting to get multiple readings out of it. Just my thoughts; happy reading!!"
4,Cast in Shadow,"Story is good and really like the cast because they were different. Because it has being from other world that are not like us, it is the type of Sifi I like to read."
2,Kinda disappointing...,"Looking for a ""new"" author to read their stuff, and...well, if this is the start of the series, I hope it vastly improves. No back story whatsoever, no idea why the main character is in the situation she's in, no idea of any real description of any of the races, whether this is a purely fantasy world, or based upon real life.I still haven't finished it yet, but only 1/3rd of the way through, and had to go to something else, for now. Will try it from scratch at a later time."
2,"Interesting world, claustrophobic writing","While I don't regret purchasing this book, I found the writing style very claustrophobic. It was sometimes unclear what was happening and how everything worked. The drawback to such a finely detailed world is that it's difficult for the author to introduce all the content we need to know in an interesting way. I found the characters actions somewhat unrealistic, perhaps because I didn't know enough about the class and race dynamics involved. The author is a perfectly competent writer, but I just didn't like her style. I'd recommend reading excerpts before buying to see if you have the same reaction."
2,Not very good,"I'm with the other reviewers. Confusing, needing to reread pages because of the choppy writing and the heroine is not very likeable. Keeping the reader in the dark about what's going on made it hard to read, I almost gave up on it. I certainly didnt hurry to finish the book. At least I got more done around the house because it wasn't hard to put down."
4,Couldn't put it down,"Couldn't put this down. Non stop action and plot really pulls you in. the only downside is that in my opinion the author is not very good at describing things in a way you can visualize (IE, people, landscapes, buildings, etc...)"
2,"Even after finishing the book, I still wasn't quite sure what it was about","Once an impoverished and homeless orphan, Kaylin has worked toward becoming a Hawk, the equivalent of a police force in this fantasy world. The recent deaths of local children hit entirely too close to home as she becomes involved with trying to discover who/what is causing them. Although I haven't exactly come to expect greatness from Luna books, this was disappointing. I spent most of the book confused -- not only about the immediate goings-on, but also about the entire plot in general. I didn't feel I had enough information or understanding about the world the protagonist lives in or even about Kaylin herself for the story to come together and make sense. Fans of other books published under Harlequin's Luna imprint will be disappointed in the absence of any romantic element to the book whatsoever."
5,A Very Fun Start to A New Series!,"I really enjoyed this book! At first, the dry narration - dry in humour, not in interest - was a bit off-putting. I think that this would not have been in the case if the book was written in first-person, rather than third, but as I became more accustomed to her style, I really loved it! And it's always so exciting to start a new series! In some ways, this book reminded me of what I remember from reading Maggie Furey's _Aurian_ a long time ago, and more recently, Maria V. Snyder's books. Either way, I am really enjoying this series and am quite excited to continue reading them!"
4,Did I enjoy it BECAUSE I had no idea what was happening?,"At the end all I could come up with was, 'I really like it, but I have no idea why.'I think I enjoyed it for the same reason I hated it. I'm a little tired of too much detail, predictability, and some authors tendancey to spell everything out from page one. Cast in Shadow did not spell out anything....I'm still trying to process it several days later. It bordered on infuriating-the feeling that I just never really figured out what they were talking about, what was going on, or the general point of anything. But it was also very entertaining and I can't wait to get Cast in Courtlight."
4,Engaging and fast paced = great read!,"I picked this up just a week ago and have since been compelled to buy both of the follow-ups, and I can't wait until the fourth book is coincidentally released next month! Kayla was raised in a tough neighborhood but now belongs to a quasi-police force called the hawks. As much as she tries to forget her violent and painful past she can't escape the mysterious marks on her body, and when she is assigned to investigate the murder of children bearing similar marks Kaylin is forced to draw on strength and magic she didn't know she possesed. Complicating an already complex situation, her new partner is not exactly new to her. He's from her old neighborhood and was like a brother to her until a startling act of violence forever ended her childhood. Through the course of the investigation Kaylin will encounter magic and ancient races that will help her realize she might of escaped her past, but it will still affect her future."
4,Cast In Shadow,"A fast moving, believable sci fi. Written with humor, the characters bring the imagination to full alert. Looking forward to seeing the heroine grow to her full potential in future stories."
2,"Confusing, overly long fantasy. Nothing urban about it","The cover and description on the back of this book made me think thiswas an urban fantasy. It's not. There is nothing urban about it.That's not to say it's a bad book, it's not, but it is straight upfantasy.The author tried very hard to create her own unique fantasy world fullof magic and otherworldly creatures, but the result is a bitconfusing. Even after finishing the book I'm still a little confused.This book is also way too long for the story. It could have been halfas long and had a much better pace. I found myself getting frustratedas Kaylin was called before her superior's for the twelfth time andyelled at, threatened, and given no explanation for her repeatedquestions. It felt very, very, redundant.Also, this is nothing romantic in this book. Nothing at all. Iprefer some romantic elements in these kind of books I felt it'sabsence here."
1,How many incomplete sentences can you fit on one page?,"I really wanted to like this, but it's one of the worst-written fantasies I've ever read. Apparently little money is expended on editing at Luna Books. The writing is so awkward, repetitive and dull that much of it simply wastes space and insults the reader's intelligence. It's about what I'd expect a talented eighth-grader to write. There are multiple incomplete sentences on every page, the descriptions are lackluster and cliched and the dialogue is dull and staccato.It's so disappointing that this book wasn't edited adequately. If the author had been challenged to tighten the writing, it could have been turned into something readable, if not actually good. I'm astonished at the positive promotional comments on the jacket and wonder if the reviewers actually read the book."
3,Great characters except for the heroine,"The world in which the author writes is very interesting. All the races are intriguing. The heroine - Kaylin starts off fairly interesting and goes downhill from there. I can't understand why the other characters think so highly of her. She is frequently terribly annoying. Another difficulty is the writing style. It is somewhat confusing. Several times I had to go back and reread a sentence. The book is not worth that. If Michelle Sagara can make her main character more interesting, the setting of this world shows considerable promise."
4,A very enjoyable read!,"Kaylin is a member of the Hawks (the city of Elantra's police force). She is given an assignment to investigate a series of deaths in the Nightshade, the fief she had escaped from seven years earlier, with a Dragon Lord and a man she knows she can't trust as her partners. Deaths linked closely to her and the mysterious markings that cover her body. Kaylin is forced to deal with not only the murderers but her past and unusual powers as well.This is the first book I have read by Michelle Sagara and I look forward to reading more by her in the future. The plot moved quickly and although some scenes were hard to follow/understand they were later explained and I did not feel they detracted from the story. The next book in the series comes out in August and I cannot wait to read it. I would definitely recommend this book."
2,Not so good,"I bought this book a while back but just now got around to reading it. I'm a fan of luna but I wonder what they thought when they were reading this. Its really confusing in the beginning throwing characters in there that dont have much of an explaination since they aren't human. It would have been better for me if there were more details about their society since its other worldly like, to be honest I dont feel anything towards the characters. If one of them died, I'd be like oh well I guess. The main character is double sided, like she wants to still be friends with Severn, yet killing him at the same time?? Its mainly lacking alot of explaination. But I will trudge on and finish it and probably read the others since I already bought them, which I know regret. I had high hopes from the 5 star rating i saw. Just proves to show I need to read the first one before purchasing the books that follow after. Hope this review helps."
3,"Easy, fun read","I enjoyed this book, however at times there weren't enough details to really understand what is going on. This is a slight flaw in the entire series. That said I've read every book and find it an enjoyable read."
3,last squeezing of the grapes,"This is nearly the last of the carry on ""hospital"" movies. By now they have run out of original ideas. In the ""carry on again doctor"" movie by Wham the audio commentary by one of the actors uses the expression ""bottom of the barrel"" to describe these later films. You should not buy this if you are new to Carry On. Instead buy one of the more highly rated movies. If you are a collector this is worth your buying it.It looks like this is not the wham version which has an audio commentary about the filming and is 9:16 screen size."
1,Veto and disregard,"This book is not worth the time to read or even browse. Stick with his ""Five Day Course in Thinking"" if you can find a copy or his ""Thinking Course."""
4,How Woodstock Changed Graham's Life :>),"I have long been a fan of Graham Parker and The Rumor. I've noticed that some who have reviewed this CD mention the sound is so much different. I would think so. I believe it's the years living in the hills of Woodstock N.Y. that has done so. The biggest bonus of this CD is having his good friend, Garth Hudson of The Band playing on it. This is one fine CD and another musical journey for Parker."
2,Should've been called Above and Beyond Annoying...,"Kyla's behavior through out this whole book came across as irrational. When she wasnt talking to herself about how much she still loved her dead hubby, she was actting selfish and just plain self absorbed. When she finds out about Trav's lies, she then turns into giantic, rightous bitch.This book would've been half way decent if the heroine could've been more lovable or more reasonable.. her love for her dead hubby came across as unbeliveable.. if she did love him al ALL at any point in her life.Get ready to spend your afternoon annoyed to all hell, if you do decide to try this book. Not one of her better books, at all..."
2,Just skip it.,"Sandra Brown is a wonderful story teller who is usually so adept at developing characters and designing surprising and intricate plots. However, with this novel I had to force myself to continue reading the novel after discovering the quintessential letters were sappy and sadly lacking. If like me, you are a Sandra Brown fan, just skip this one and go on to another of her novels."
2,Almost fell asleep,I found this book by Sandra Brown to be incredibly boring. It was very annoying how Kyla was trying to be faithful to her deceased husband throughout the book. This book just did nothing for me.
2,A Classic Love Story?,"Don't be fooled by the inscription on the cover. This book is classic only in the Harlequin Romance sense. The premise could have been interesting if the story itself wasn't so annoying. The main characters are a man driven by an obsession and a compulsively grieving widow. I felt like handing out referrals to a good psychologist. The language is stilted and slightly off-putting. There are a few moments in the book which could be touching, but were handled ineptly by the writer."
5,Unbelievable Story,"I thought this was a wonderful book.The story was a great love story.The main character,Kyla,loved her late husband so deeply that she is not able to turn loose of him after he dies to make room for another love.It causes her more pain in the long run.Kyla is a young mother whoes Marine husband is killed the day after the couple's first child is born. She picks up the pieces of her life and trys to continue caring for herself and her son.Through a chain of events,Kyla meets the best friend of her deceased husband,Trevor. Trevor falls in love with Kyla the first time he sees her and pursues her effections. Trevor does not tell Kyla who he is for fear that she will reject him do to his connection to her late husband. When the truth comes out, it causes a big blowup between Kyla and Trevor. The end of the book is dynamic."
4,"I enjoyed it, but -","I enjoyed the novel, but Kyla's behavior became very frustrating after a while. Her undying love for her 1st husband was beautiful, but even after poor Trevor managed to marry her, it was about a month before she'd get close to him. And after he slavishly did all she could dream of, she still said some really wretched, ugly things to him when she found out the truth (which of course she does). Personally, I'm dying to find out what happens to Babs. Is there any hope Sandra Brown will write a story about Babs, a woman who is not strictly chaste like all of Brown's heroines, but still has a wonderfyul heart?"
1,"If you see it, just throw it straight into the trash","I picked this book up at the airport to kill time. The book was so bad that I threw it in the trashcan to make sure no one else had a chance to waste their time. Kyla's irrational attachment to her dead husband was increadibly annoying. She needed counseling and it doesn't look like she had any. Someone else mentioned to skip this book and go to another. I will read another Sandra Brown book, but if the next one is as silly as this one, then I'll be through with her."
5,Another excellent novel,What can I say more. I'm a dedicated SB reader. I love her novels. This is one of the best. Just great. Burcu Ergen
5,Osmonds Bio,Bought for my mother. She has enjoyed it as well as the other gifts she received involving the Osmond family.
4,FAB OSMONDS!,"This was an historic look at the Osmond history and lifestyle of the guys. Really interesting from their beginnings to 1998 when it finished, but the interviews with the Osmonds were lovely and quite in depth."
1,good for a b-day prsent?,my brother loves these game. )hes favorite is the one for computer but we lost the disk when i was in kindergarten) when this comes out tell me how great it is!
3,Not as bad as the others say. Good for killing an afternoon or evening.,"Go into this with low expectations and you should come away pleased. Sure, this is a bit of a rip-off of ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" movies, but don't let that steer you away. I mean, you probably liked those movies right? Like chocolate? Like peanut butter? Mix 'em together and what have you got? Maybe something else you like, ah?This flick is definitely a step up from the usual cheap and bad sci-fi fare that you find out there (think ""Carnosaur 3: Primal Species""). Decent albeit derivative story with decent SFX and at least four decent actors (John Savage, Martin Kove, Michelle Yoh and James Marshall). It's got all the sci-fi/horror science-gone-awry along with picking-off-the-elite-military-unit-one-by-one elements that you'd expect and, perhaps, prefer.Check it out. It won't hurt you."
3,Pass the popcorn,"I've seen a lot worse than this, despite what everybody else says, it's an okay popcorn movie. It has a ton of mistakes but still viewable. For those of you who like that kind of movie, it starts kinda slow, but as soon as they enter the underground complex the shooting starts.I give it a solid three stars regardless of the mistakes, worth a rent or buy it used (I did) and I'm not sorry.BYE!"
4,william friedkin is still dining out on this film,"This is really a great and gritty film, about the only one by William Friedkin that I truly care about. It looks just smashing on BluRay and comes with a bevy of extras worthy of a classic. Heck, just the chance to see New York City in the early Seventies make this riveting, never mind the headlong chase after a drug smuggling operation by the incomparable Gene Hackman. But it's $20 more expensive than the regular DVD and on sale at Amazon the difference is even worse: $23 versus $8, which is almost three times as much. If you don't own it yet, it's so good this might be worth the extra cost. But boy that's a big price jump. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
4,I loved it,Being that I saw this movie before it was a must for me to get this movie ! so now i haVe it and enjoying it the case was perfect the Dvd was perfect quality !
1,The French Connection,This DVD was very disappointing because it was not the full movie. It ended in America with the Frenchman returning home. The movie was much longer with Popeye Doyle going to to Paris to follow up on the case. The most exciting and important conclusion of the film was deleted.
1,"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE.","C'mon people! How fun is it to watch a racist, lewd, borrish, and dumb person beating up people for no f-----g reason. As little as possible. All the film does is show two unorthadox sleep in car all night, hold up bars just because there are black people there, and reapeatedly getting the same food as 24 minutes ago. And a point that should go out, THERE IS NO CAR CHASE! Just someone chasing a train! I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars! BYE!"
4,the french connection review,"I was 7 or 8 yrs old at that time during the actual screening of this version . I can`t understand the whole thing at the time, now I`m 49 yrs old and begun to wonder and understand that drug dealing is more dangerous b4 than at present, with a very dedicated cop as Gene Hackman, if only this film be shwn to the present police set up, only then they can ralize how the power of the will can turn or pin down criminals. I appreciate what Gene Hackman had portrayed in this film. I salute him. I wonder if any one of those police setup can match the integrity of police forces b4, dealing with narcotics syndicate."
5,Absolutely the best!,"Why do you think it won 5 Oscars, huh? Because, you had an excellent cast of two Americans and a couple of European imports, an intense director, incredible material to adapt, and a very good screenwriter known for hard-hitting cop movies. In the end, it walks for with Best Picture, Director (Friedkin), Actor (Hackman), Screenplay (Ernest Tidyman), and Film Editing. That is impressive, especially with such compition as ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""Nicholas and Alexandra."" This film is an absolute treasure -- one for your library collecton of Best Picture films (like I do at home)!"
1,Disappointed Buyer,The picture of the product with Gene Hackman on the cover of the jewel case IS NOT what I received. All I got was the movie in a blank jewel case. Isn't that false advertising?
3,non stop action,"If you like a gritty, non-stop action movie, you will love what you see here. Popeye, the psycho cop who cares about nothing except getting his prey, was a defining role for Hackman. The car chase scene ranks as one of the best ever. NYC looks like a filthy mess ( which it was, and still is ), and adds to the effect of the film. Great action movie!!"
3,"An okay film, but...","...why did William Friedkin earn an Oscar for this film and not The Exorcist? The Exorcist is better directed than this film, I must say. Anyway, this film stars Gene Hackman (God, he's in a lot of movies). It was released in 1971 and I think it won best picture. Did it? I'm not sure...anyway, rent it if you like car-chase movies."
5,You can almost smell NYC!,"""Hey, ya ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?"" Gotta love this film. Great acting, great NYC feel, great realism and fantastic villains. The hoodlums ain't bad either. Hackman is a revelation. You can see why he's still in such demand as an actor. Don't miss this one."
5,THE BEST CRIME MOVIE EVER MADE!,"French Connection is a exciting action/crime film starring Gene Hackman as Popeye Dole, a N.Y. Narcotics Cop who is investigating the recent flow of herion coming into N.Y. He and his partner (Roy Shrieder) get into the absorbing process of phone tapping, following suspects, and stakeouts. A real good crime movie from director William Friedkin. One of the best films ever made, also has the most exciting chase scene in history. A winner!!"
4,THE FRENCH CONNECTION,"DEFINITELY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST. IT CONTAINS SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT ONE WANTS TO VIEW IT SEVERAL TIMES OVER, JUST SO THAT YOU HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING!"
3,Good but not great,"This movie was good, but it wasn't THAT good.The ending itself is a HUGE left-off-hanging disappointment.It doesn't really stand out from a lot of other cop movies that received far less attention."
2,A thoroughly dated movie,"Man, what a bore. I watched it because of all the accolades this movie has received over the years. Maybe it was good years ago, but this movie has not aged well at all. I mean, cmon, the whole premise is around $500,000 worth of heroin. Please. Even in today's dollars, that's a joke. The movie spends 10 minutes watching the cops rip the car apart trying to find where the drugs are stashed. Today, drug traffickers rent 26 foot Ryder trucks to move the stuff around. The vaunted chase scene was ok, but again, it's nothing special compared to what's done today.Essentially, almost the entire movie consists of watching a couple unlikeable cops tail bad guys for over an hour. Yawn."
2,Yawn,"This movie is almost as old as I am, and it shows. I just don't have an hour to invest in getting interested in a movie. I just about gave up at the hour mark, but pushed through it. This is just a snoozer of a film.The ending is just ridiculous, there's no tension, Roy's character barely speaks. If not for Hackman this movie wouldn't even be watchable."
4,4.2 out of 5,"Adapted from Robin Moore's fact-based novel, THE FRENCH CONNECTION was the breakthrough film for both direction William Friedkin, who later went on to direct THE EXORCIST, and Gene Hackman. Hackman stars in his Academy Award-winning role as ""Popeye"" Doyle, a New York City cop who, along with partner ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider), stumbles upon a drug ring headed by a Frenchman (Fernando Rey) who uses an innocent-seeming actor (Frederic de Pasquale) to cover the operation. Along with Hackman's forementioned award for ""Best Actor"", the film also took in Best Director for Friedkin; Best Film Editing; Best Writing (Ernest Tidyman) and a deserved Best Picture. The chase scenes are outstanding and some of the best ever filmed; Hackman is excellent in one of his greatest roles. Action fans won't want to pass this one by; followed by FRENCH CONNECTION II and a floppish TV movie."
3,"In retrospect, this seems a bit over-rated","There are some interesting aspects to this film, but viewing it in 2013, I was surprised that it seemed slow, given its reputation as a dynamic film. Also, although Gene Hackman is decent in the film, he because a much better actor later. Overall it was a bit of a letdown. But it looks good on the Blu-ray."
4,Beautiful,"This is a very nice version of Swan lake. The dancing is wonderful and the principles are good. My only down point is Mikhalchenko. Her technique is a bit rusty. She is a bit old school. But, the ball room scene is amazing. TOTAL DRAMA. The music for the variations of the black swan and the prince go really well with the over all mood. Best version on the market"
4,Good overal picture,"The book has a good overall explanation of techniques used by firefighters. There are examples of personal experiences which help illustrate the need for the protocols discussed. As with all good books however, it contradicts itself while describing the recommended procedures based on the extenuating circumstances."
3,Promotional Material,"This item was used as one of our promotional books. Some of it was beneficial but some ofit was repeats of other materials. Since the author is from the North East there tactics differfrom what is used in our region. Nothing against the author but I wish the people who picthe material for us would use material that is more ""relevant"" tactic/construction wise to Ft. Worth."
2,bought for promotional exam,"long winded NY firefighter with a lot of ""I did's"" and ""I"", ""I"", ""I"". I thought the read was teadious and not very educational."
5,Covers Everything,"This book is excellent for the beginner, intermediate and advanced art enthusiast. It crosses over all cultures and eras and connects them all using unique and interesting themes. It also covers the basic design elements and visual fundamentals and can be used again and again for any art class: drawing, painting, sculpture, art appreciation."
2,inadequate disclosure,Received the book in a timely fashion but the CD-ROM and the Timeline were NOT included. This should have been clearly stated in the listing! The Timeline was to be a 60th birthday present for my twin sister.
5,Thorough and enjoyable,"One of the best art history guides I've read. Well illustrated, organized and extremely diverse as far as media, styles, and cultures. Fine for beginners, or for people who already know a fair amount about art and artists."
4,Cute and Funny,"I didn't think I'd like this movie. As it takes real genius to pull off a ""narrative"" or the story teller aspect, which this director was obviously lacking the talent to do... However, putting that aside, I thought the over-all movie was funny, the acting was ok, the concept was great... and was well worth buying."
2,Give me a break,"This movie had too many production issues. Even though I love to watch Vivica Fox, her narration in this movie annoyed the heck out of me. She talked to the camera WAY too much for the movie's own good. Anthony Anderson was the only character that I truly liked in the movie. His attitude and playful posturings was a refreshing change of pace to the (numerous) annoying crying and whining scenes. I have to ask one question to Morris: Why did you do this movie? Are you that desperate for money? Are time really that bad? It started off really bad, but got interesting towards the middle, then it ended predictably. Hands down one of the worst of the new ""blackploitative"" films of our era. Do yourself a favor, see this movie when it's in the $1.99, 5 day rental section of Blockbuster. You'll still have overpaid though."
3,Two Can Play That Game,"I thought that the movie was pretty funny. It was much better than How to be a Player, same writer. Anthony Anderson and Mo'Nique kept me in stitches. I didn't like that Viveca narrated the whole movie, that got on my nerves. This movie is definately worth checking out and not just a rental! This was a well acted movie. Bobbie Brown could've had a larger role I thought. If you're depressed, this will sure bring you a couple of laughs to take your mind off your worries"
1,train wreck on cable...,"One has to wonder what good film wasn't made for this p.o.s. Too many cliches to count: every sister is an exec, every brother is a player.Some garbage has to be watched to see how bad it can be. I'm in the wrong business. Would have been made for tv except for all the swearing.Now to read the five-star hallucinations."
5,I've always loved this movie!,"I've loved this movie since the first time I seen it, the quality and sound is just like being back in the theater."
1,Low quality sound,The volume is low and even with my Tv turned all the way up I can barely hear it : (
5,Two Can Play That Game,"I liked this Film~ I thought it was full of fun and I found myself very amused with this Woman vs.Man thinking! I had to laugh during some of the 10 step's in this film~ Why? Because some of it I've played the Game that way myself~ and it worked, well to a degree~If you are looking for a ""Fun Film""~ buy this one ~ The whole Cast was nothing but perfection~ It was IMO a good Film~Buy it yourself and ""Enjoy""~"
2,just okay,The movie has the characters that you liked and scenes that are funny. But I didn't like the story. I am not a game player when it comes to relationships so I had lost interest.
3,Can and do play that game!,"I thought it was a cute movie! If you're looking for some endearing drama and Oscar nominees, skip it! But if you're after some laughs and a feel good ending, it's worth the money. Vivica and Morris take the corporate thing perhaps a tad too far, but they look great doing it. The movie really plays to what really goes on inside a sista's head when she thinks she's in control. I loved her dialog to the camera! Hey, she's talking to you! To all of us who've been in that situation at some point in time. It's a real relief from the gansta, thug, and poor black folks in the ghetto movies."
4,Good Movie,"Two Can Play That Game features the oh so sexy Morris Chestnut and Vivica A. Fox. This film is a comedy about the games men and women play in a relationship and the rules each sex believes they are supposed to abide by in a relationship. Two Can Play That Game reflects the real-life drama of how to react in situations that develop in a relationship and whether or not one should get advice from one's know-it-all friends, (Tamala Jones, Wendy Racquel, Monique, and Anthony Anderson). The characters are all intelligent and professional African Americans, which is a change from what Hollywood usually displays. This movie will keep you laughing and will have you saying, ""ain't that the truth"" and have you thinking ""damn, that's good."" This is a great purchase."
3,What they don't mention,"This book was cute. We bought a couple and intended them to be gifts for our parents, first time grandparents. What is not mentioned at all in the description is that this book has a lot of talk about God and teaching grandchildren about christian values. If this is the kind of family you are a part of then this would be a great little gift. But it is not always appropriate for everyone and because there was no warning we now have to return these books."
5,Always Have Popsicles,This is a great gift for new grandparents. I give friends that are having their first grandchild one. They seem to enjoy it. It has cute things to do with kids.
3,Fair,"The cover was almost ripped off. I didn't see that in the description. The book returned on time,so I'm thankful for that."
1,Fugettaboutit,"This album is a fraud - this is not Remedy. Remedy is the greatest rap singer of our time. He performs with members of the Wu Tang Clan and would vomit if he knew that this type of music was going out over his name. Napster snapster, this is a bigger crime. Remedy makes his own beats WRITES all his own words and they mean something. Remedy better get a lawyer, both the real one and the fake one."
2,NEW AGED ALBUM,"This is not a wu album, but for those of you looking for some instrumental work by ""Remedy,"" in this case a non wu-tang clan member, pick it up."
2,The Breakup Club,"Breaking up is the catalyst that will transform the lives for four people. Lucy Miller-Materson finds that her husband, who has recently flipped out in front of their family, has made one New Year's resolution, to leave her. Her sister's life of serial monogamy's most recent break up has left Miranda with many regrets, and what if's. Miranda's new room-mate and the girl Lucy has recently hired as an assitant, Roxy, walked out of her own wedding, and Christopher, the single father competing with Lucy for a promotion, faces the challenges of being a noncustodial dad on a daily basis.Told from each of their points of view, this story often seems very disjointed. However, the fact that each does manage to make a comeback from disaster is noteworthy. Yet, a cleaner ending without more resolution would have been appreciated.Amanda Killgore"
3,Good Book,"I thought the book was pretty good. I like how the characters had different situations when it came to their break-ups. It gives us insight on how to deal and what to expect in most cases of being the one who are dumped or doing the dumping. Its humorous, I liked it, lol."
3,Average,"I am usually a fan of this author. However, I am giving this book three stars because it is not up to par with her last book, at all.The premise of The Breakup Club is fairly standard chick lit stuff. While the story is midly entertaining, I felt as though some pages just dragged and dragged. For example, the opening chapter in which the author sets up the entire premise (yes, I agree it is important) but she just went on and on describing in minute details the Thanksgiving scene.There were too many exchanges describing ""lifted eyebrows"" and ""food being removed from clothing"".So, basically, this is not a horrible book, but it is way too slow.I have mentioned this in the past. RED DRESS INK has become hugely hit or miss with me - with lately more misses than hits."
2,In Th South of France,"This book is a bit of a disappointment. Although it contains some beautiful, artistic pictures, I was looking for a book that would highlight all the specific cities and villages with actual photos--not artsy shots. I wanted a book that would remind me of my trip to Nice, Monaco etc. and this one does not."
4,"Good Chips, Ok Container...","The chips are great. They are clay chips that we enjoy, we picked a design that exactly matched what we previously had as we were running out of chips on evenings when we had a larger crowd. By adding this set we now have additional colors to increase the values and more chips.The only drawback to this set is the container. Sometimes it feels like it may buckle under the weight of the chips, but so far hasnt. My real issue with the container is that there are 10 rows of 75 chips. Which does not allow for an easy break down by color for each of the rows, its a nit picky detail which detracts from my overall satisfaction with the product."
5,Great kit for the inquisitive kid!!,"The Scientific Explorer's Ultimate Crystal Growining Science KitScientific Explorer's Ultimate Crystal Growing Science Kitis a great kit for variety and interaction. I got this for my 8 year old grandson who is a real science 'explorer' and he just loved it. He was into the kit and growing crystals before you could say Jack Robinson. (Okay, that's an old saying!) He loved that there were so many to grow and all the varieties kept him interested. He is a real fan of science experiments and this kit just kept him involved and enthused through all of the kinds of crystals he was growing. It is a real value for the price and I know that any child interested in science will like it."
3,FUN but instructions were not very clear,We bought this crystal kit to help us with a Science fair project for my 2nd grader and although it was a huge hit with the science fair it was not very good as far as instructions go. One of the crystals didn't even grow and my husband is pretty good with science. Also the containers were not big enough to hold the chemicals plus the growing crystals. The blue Geode was my daughters favorite.
3,Crystals,"I bought this for my eight yr old son for Christmas and we have done some of the cystals, they do not work that well and I had to do most of the pouring and mixing and all being that I didnt want chemicals all over my kitchen. I rated this poorly because its not very hands on for kids and they crystals left alot to be desired, did not get any to look like the box."
1,Doesn't grow crystals,"My 10 year old son requested this gift for x-mas and is very disappointed. We tried 3 times to ""grow"" crystals. All we got were flat pancakes. We followed the instructions - but no crystals ever grew. After the 3 times, he was done with trying and, like I said, very disappointed."
1,Check the box,When we got this product the instuctions were missing from the box.We cannot even grow the crystals because we can't get instructions :(
2,Instructions leave something to be desired,Watch out if you think you can give this to a kid and not help out extensively! The instructions are skimpy at best but the materials seem to be okay.
4,Crystal Growing Science Kit,"This was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals. I told him I did something like that when I was a child, grew rock formations in a fish bowl."
2,To messy to ever want to do the projects,"We have only done a couple of projects, it is extremely messy and will stain. My highschooler had no real interest in it, as my middle schooler finds it interesting but often forgets it even exsists in the house. Everyone in our house lost interest in it pretty quickly. Best for a parent that loves doing these type of activities WITH their kid and doesn't worry to much about messes or stains in their home. Not overly educational, it just tells you to mix this with that, so you are just throwing ingredients together but not really sure what or why it is making formations... not overly amazing formations either... although maybe if we did more, there might be better formations to complete."
3,ultimate crystal growing kit,"not sure, it was a gift to my grandson, he has not opened it yet, he loves rocks so I hope it is something that he will enjoy"
4,"Fun, but limited fun!","I got this for my 5-year-old son who loves science. The directions are simple, but patience of a 5-year-old is not! I really wanted him to be involved, but I had to pretty much do the whole thing while he watched and his attention wasn't really in it so basically- I had a lot of fun! I recommend this for maybe 6 years and older. This was my fault being over eager for a project that was for a child too young to have the patience! And please don't misunderstand me! This kit was fun!!!"
5,Growing crystals,Enjoyed seeing actual crystals grow and the experiments were detailed correctly and tried Parental guidance is necessary for through out these experiments you will need to boil water My daughter used project of blue sapphire sparkled crystals and was able to use scientific method to presentation
4,fun,time consuming but fun for tweens on indoor play days. adult supervision recommended. the picture on box is misleading though
2,It's CHEAP in many ways,"This Spanish DVD series seemingly look like the canceled Ultimate Uncut series, but this is a very different matter. First, the footages are not the same as they used on the Ultimate Uncut series. It's the same as the remasterd and cropped footages of the Seasonbox Series. Product Details say that the aspect ratio is 1.33:1 but it's a lie. Second, the included audio is Spanish ONLY. There's even no Japanese original audio. Third, there are no menus in the DVD. I don't understand why the FUNimation is releasing the Spanish series like this. It's really cheap, but in many ways. You should exercise caution before making a purchase."
1,A hugh bore..the trailer gives all the good stuff away,"Wow what a dissapointment a big disapointment. I found the trailer funny and could not wait to see this movie and was the movie ever boring and bad. The trailer gives away all the funny moments and all the funny moments are when Uma Thurman's charactors tells Strepp's charactor about there sex life. The film is very boring and has hardley no funny moments, it also drags on and on and on. The acting is not that good also. Overall dont waste your time watching this waste of a movie."
1,Take home message: Religious Bigots are Oh-so-cool!,"Lovely acting and dear moments in a movie that could have been really good.But, the movie ended; and, I almost felt sick to my stomach. The two main characters have let their souls die on the ancient, twin altars of religious bigotry and social conformity.Meryl Streep's part - the antiseptic, re-worked Archie Bunker of the 21st century - is bigoted, hypocritical and professionally corrupt. And, the movie basically laughs and gives it all a pass.Surely, the 60's were fought in vain."
3,AN OK CHICK FLICK,"This was an alright movie I could watch all the way through and be entertained. I didn't care for the end, it left me kinda dissappointed. This is the kind of movie I wouldn't buy, but if it was ever on tv, I'd probably watch again."
2,should have been better,finally got around to watching this film because I've always been a Huge fan of Meryl Streep's&heard about the story that has Uma Thurman&Bryan Greenburg in a story of a Relationship between a Older Woman&a Younger Man. the interesting story is that the Younger Man's Mother happens to be Uma's character's Shrink. but the Movie has so many cliches&drags in places. I didn't like how it ended&I felt it could have had more bite in the middle. after a while the film feels run of the mill&a waste of the Talent that was Assembled.
2,"watch the trailer, don't bother with the movie",This movie was extremely disappointing. I don't know why it was marketed as a comedy. The only two funny parts of the movie were in the trailer. The rest of the movie was a dramatic softcore porn. Meryl Streep's performance was terrible. I couldn't believe it. She looked very uncomfortable in front of the camera.
1,"OMG, it's bad.","Wow. A movie about age difference in a relationships. Wow. What an earth-shattering idea! wow. Add a punch of bored actor and clumsy acting and have one wow of a mediocre movie. I don't know what bothers me more: Hollywood's inability to make great movies, or the publics' insatiable appetite for movies that they will watch craps and don't know it."
4,It surprised me,"I rented this expecting only a light comedy with the expected jokes seen in the trailers. The movie surprised me. It was not just fluff (what I was expecting). There are many reviews here that outline the basic plot, so I'll skip that. I found I could relate to much of the movie. I was divorced and single in NYC in my 30's, I'm Jewish and was in therapy, much of what I saw rang true to my experiences.The only false note for me was the fabulousness of everyone's apartments (except the grandparents). The characters would have to be fabulously rich to have that much space....but such is artistic liscense in the movies. After all the 800 sq foot one bedroom apartment just isn't attractive on screen.I'm happy to say, the ending took me by surprise and it's what really made me love the movie."
2,Couldn't/didn't reach its prime :-(,"I had looked forward to seeing this movie since I heard the cast and the premise. It failed to deliver however and I was actually very disappointed in it. I found it a little long winded in parts and slow going in general. There was so much room for more humour and yet it never got off the ground. Honestly, the only thing I was impressed with was Uma Thurmans younger boyfriend/Meryl Streeps son, Bryan Greenberg. He's hot.Overall, I am sorry to say that Meryl Streeps talent was severely wasted here and I'm hoping her Devil Wears Prada movie is much much better. She and this movie were both off the boil. Don't rush to see this."
3,Pretty decent movie all the way up to the end,I would have given this movie 4 or 5 stars if the ending hadn't left me so utterly disappointed. I wouldn't buy this movie and I'll probably not watch it again.
1,Very Long And BORING Movie....Waste of Film !,"I rented this moving thinking it would be good.....Big Mistake! Save yourself some time and money and don't rent or buy this movie...waste of good film and I really like Meryl Streep. There is no exciting plot, no great acting just very dull. If you do happen to rent the movie anyway just be prepared."
1,Prime,"Hallo, unfortunately this kind of DVD does not work within European countries, therefore I am going to return it back to Amazon. But the movie itself is great, funny and Meryl Streep is incredibly great!"
2,TOO SLOW AND BAD ENDING,"FOR ME, it was a very slow movie, i was hoping to find it more interesting later.. but i stayed and stayed watching it for what? for that bad ending? damn .. at least i thought it would have a happy ending. Wasn't funny for me at all.. and thats it :D"
4,This was a good movie.,This movie was easy to watch and enjoyable and I liked the story and the actors. Meryl Streep is always great.
3,"Fair play, but not over-the-top good.","The movie portrays deeper aspects of complicated relationships, and for that I applaud it. Unfortunately, the Jewish mother seems far more interesting than either of the two romantic leads. Additionally, any time a relationship begins by a man looking in the phone book for a woman who he saw at the movie theater, the odds are against it - not because of religion or age difference, but because neither the movie theater or the phone book are appropriate places to look for love. All in all, I think it deserves a 50% rating."
1,I wanted to like this but I have to be honest...,"I was a bit excited to see this but I was dissapointed.I bet you know already the plot of this movie but I would like to point out the things that are ""wrong"" about this movie:1.The lovers in the movie does'nt have the chemistry2.Cheesy lines, specially the scene when theyre breaking up while having sex...EEEEWWWWW!3.Uma's character was'nt developed.4.Streep's (good performance,as usual)character does'nt really help the movie as a whole.These days,its really hard to find a good romantic movie and this one in particular is not good.Watch at your own risk."
1,an embarrassment,"How did I get hoodwinked into wasting 2 hours in renting this movie?? Meryl Streep seems to wearing a mask, doing a SNL parodie of herself ""acting"" Jewish. Every bad cliche in the book, along with silly dialog, and shallow charactors are stuffed into this unfunny bore of a movie."
2,Another New York chick flick,"The older woman, younger man theme is just really harsh.Add a Jewish doctor for a mother who is treating theolder woman after her divorce and you get a disaster thatreally never convinces us of more than animal passion.As a basis for a long term marriage with children,a ""happy ending"" is probably a disaster?It takes more for a successful marriage than just lust..."
3,just average.,"The plot is decent and so too the acting, especially from Meryl. The reason i have it three stars is because the editing was poor and some scenes were just pure "" filler "" as a throw in that didn't add anything to the film. Mant times a scene would end just "" hanging "" and would immediately cut to a new scence that didn't correspond to well the previous one. I think the direcor and editor are to blame for this dilemna that shows its ugly head once too many times. In other words the story line seemed fragmented and not cohevise. A good movie should have complimentary scenes that run smoothly throughout, provided there is good editing. This movie jumped all over the place and seemed rather rushed."
3,I don't know why I didn't like this more than I did,"It seems like this should have been a great film, it was only good. Meryl,it's true can do no wrong. Uma did excellent work, as did Bryan. Some of the writing was excellent, particularly regarding the issues of age, clashing cultures, etc. Meryl played a Jewish therapist and mother; it could have been stereotypical, but in her capable hands it wasn't. But, there were sitcom elements such as a nebbishy best friend to the leading man, someone who is more involved with throwing custard pies than he is in exploring his failed relationships. The pies in the face routines were an off note in this often-thoughtful film."
3,Almost Recommended,"""Prime"" scores a few points for trying something different, but its aspirations do not sustain its length. Uma Thurman is a 37-year old divorcee, and Bryan Greenberg is a 23-year old aspiring artist, and the two are involved in an older-younger romance. The ads for this film made it look like more of a comedy than it is, and they also made much more of the fact that Uma's therapist (Meryl Streep) turns out to be Bryan's mother. Those are just parts of this film, which shoots for an offbeat examination of how sometimes we love and learn and move on, and how that's an okay thing. Unfortunately, the movie kind of drags and meanders its way to this realization, some scenes seem undeveloped, and others just seem downright stolen from better movies (like ""Notting Hill""). It's a valiant effort from a young director. Perhaps he'll hit closer to the mark next time out. Worth a look on cable, not really worth buying."
2,A slight entertainment,"Somewhat weak romantic comedy, better at the romance than the comedy. The usually fabulous Meryl Streep's comedic acting seemed awkward to me in this although I thought Uma Thurman did a good job as did the male lead."
2,There's always Uma,"If I try to watch another Manhattan comedy romance flick, I shall poke my eyeballs out first in order to better appreciate it. Meryl, Uma, what are you thinking? Ah, Money of course. Who can blame you? Formula, formula, formula. The really big problem here was the numbskull leading man. Clearly a Mafioso insert ""actor"".Are we really expected to believe this stud dudoo is an artist? Who is loved by Uma? No acting required....just read the lines, raise the eyebrows in that sexy TV manner and be ""cool"". I'm not an airhead chick that this movie was manufactured to target, so it is easier for me to be objective//\\ a poop is a poop. My wife even thought it was terrible. What more can I say?Oh yes, really bad pop music score to boot."
2,Disables Itself on Users' Computers,"McAfee has been trying for over three months to resolve various problems with the product disabling itself on users' computers.With an anti-virus product, of course, that's about as bad a bug as you can get.In my case, the product disables itself every time I use Roxio's Drag-to-Disc.The forums at McAfee are full of different instances of this same problem."
2,tremendous amount of blather,"I couldn't sleep tonight so I decided to read this book. Steenbarger is an excellent writer and can definitely tell a good story, but the problem is, and it's a large one, it's very jumbled and interrupted with another recommendation for another book that he thinks is great but tells you little about. And so it goes. Halfway through I began to wonder if any of this would change. I continued on, and the answer is no. Lots and lots recommendations, some stories about his ABC plan. Not much value overall. I'd give it a pass. /TKL"

1,"Worthy reading for any student of political philosophy, but ultimately dangerous to our republic.","To correct the previous reviewer - Wilson did not think separation of power didn't exist, but that in reality they shouldn't exist. If you favor a historicist government unlimited in size and scope, and reject the universal truths espoused in the Declaration of Independence, then this is your book and Wilson is your man."
4,Quiet I am listening!!!,I am wondering why I bought this CD. I find the music sparse and minimal yet I want more. There are no big surprises or monster hooks just subtle nuances of sound and voice. What I really like about the music is how easy it is to listen to and at the same time how difficult is to stay focused on the music and not get lost in some deep thought. A nice change of pace for the fast -pace world.
1,in a galaxie far far away (from good art),"comes these bozos (just look at the picture of Damon--he IS bozo!)--boy this band is terrible. very bad Renaissance music vibe. stupid lyrics. no real melodies. avoid avoid avoid--danger, Will Robinson."
4,if one is born outside of bullfighting culture and would like a peek inside this provides it,A lot of times people end up hating something because they cant understand it. I am not going to get into the politics of bullfighting but If one wants to appreciate the tradition and view bullfighting as more of an art this book will help you get a peek at it.
4,Excellent primer for bullfighting lore.,"I've reread this book for the third time this time. Main, and very vital, misgiving is that I miss the pictures in the real book. If you don't want to miss the former, get the paperback or hardcover. It's worth more than half the totality of the book."
4,Not just the bullfight,"Hemingway's love letter to the people of pre-Franco Spain, to the sights and sounds and grand traditions and to the bullfight (la fiesta) particularly. I can imagine no book being a more thorough explanation of the tradition of bullfighting and a discussion of the men and animals which are brought together in the ring.Hemingway is here too, with his thoughts on death, writing, and life; wine and women. He pours disdain on the cowards of the ring and shows his love of life and the bravery of the great bulls and the men who understand them. The book transcends its subject in the hands of this master."
4,"Great for learning, not travelling","It is a good book to get some background information about what you will see when you enter the bullring. It isn't 100% interesting in that some parts of it are off the subject, but for the most part it is great because I promise that going into a bullfight with no advance knowledge is a bad idea. Also, remember that it was written in 1932 and is maybe not 100% up to ""the times"" in a way, but it shows Hemingway's style of writing which for the most part is an excellent style. I think that you should buy it because it has some helpful things in it about everything relating to bullfighting from where to sit, to what to what, to where to go, to how to tell if a bull is brave or cowardly, etc. Again, for the most part, it is a great classic novel about a great classic sport (but ""not in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word"" (from the book)). So if you are going to have something to do with a bullfight you should read this book."
3,The ABC of Bullfgihting,"This is the only book I found written in English that describes the Bullfighting with great detail. I do not consider it to be a great novel but it is closer to be a ""text book"". The art and technique of bullfighting is explained to you in a warm, friendly and casual way, just likes your grandfather or a close friend would."
4,An excellent piece of bullfighting literature,"I found this book fascinating. I am not a big Hemingway fan, but I am a fan of bullfighting, and it was great to read of the Spanish history of the sport. The only complaint I have is that at times he tends to ramble...however, this book is a superb starting point for any who are intersted in bullfighting...and it has great photos too!!"
1,Absolute Drivel,"I read this book for the literary circle at my high school, and we unanimously declared it the worst thing we had ever read. It had no structure, so it appeared to be a mixed-up jumble of thoughts. Since there was no structure, the author strays off the ""topic"" (supposedly bullfights) quite frequently into little discussions about ""venereal diseases"", which he claims are relevant as they are a cause of death to many bullfighters.Perhaps if you have a Spanish background or love bullfighting, or possibly Ernest Hemmingway, it is possible you could relate to this book and enjoy it.Please note that our lit. circle read other books by Ernest Hemmingway. Those books, including ""A Farewell to Arms"", ""The Old Man and the Sea"", and ""The Sun Also Rises"", are definitely worth the read. Just because you liked other books by the same author, please do not assume you will like this one. I LOVED ""The Old Man and the Sea"" and ""The Sun Also Rises"", but I couldn't stand this book."
1,"Great Writer. Horrific, outdated material.","Hemmingway may be a classic - but that doesn't mean this book has any place in literary history.How can an intelligent person defend a blood sport between man and animal that is unfair from the get-go? In bullfighting, the bull, whether he wins the fight or not, will always be sent to a gruesome death. It is a hideous, cruel sport that every Spaniard and supporter, should be ashamed of. Why it has not been outlawed, is a disgrace.Burn this book!"
3,The Key,"A friend pressed me a while back to read Hemingway. I hadn't touched him since Freshman English--getting to be a VERY long time ago. I was most impressed by ""The Undefeated."" It's a world class short story, but I knew I was missing parts of it. This is the explanation--enough about bull-fighting as Hemingway understood it and as it was practiced between the wars to let us who have not grown up in the culture understand it.For that reason, it's earned a place on my shelves.In other ways, it's outdated--reviews of the style of bullfighters dead 50 years or more--or self-indulgent. (""The Natural History of the Dead"" is thrown in for reasons comprehensible only to Hemingway.) Be prepared to skim.But when you read Hemingway with a bull-fighting setting, have this book handy."
1,Too drawn out!,I usually enjoy reading this author however that was not the case in this particular title. The plot was too drawn out.
5,How did I miss this?,"I love this cookbook. Miyoko has so many interesting and innovative ideas on how to prepare meals. I live in the UK and all the ingredients she lists are readily available to me. I bought the her Artisian Cheese cookbook, then watched some online videos of her and after that I was hooked and got this book. I can't wait to make some of these recipes."
1,Good cookbook but a poor kindle version,"This is a very good cookbook, but only in traditional format. Unfortunately it does not have an indexed table of contents rendering the Kindle version nearly useless as a reference book which is ultimately what a cookbook is. Cookbook authors who publish ebooks please do your homework and think of what you are doing."
3,Enjoyable to watch after watching the classic movie Tremors,Good not great. It was fun to watch after watching the first movie Tremors but I wouldn't exactly recommend it.
2,Not as good as #1,"This one was not even close to as good as the first one, it had a little better graphics, more graboids, but it was stupid! It is okay for one of those ""So dumb it's funny"" movies, just to sit and watch. Take my advice, the first one is the very best, one of my personal favorite movies!"
3,"a sequel thats good, but no Kevin Bacon",Bacon bits didnt do this one. it lags in a few spots then its great when they transform into the next stage. Fred Ward and Michael Geoss reprise theire roles. Gross goes all out in this one and the explosion at the end is great.a must see for fans of the first one
4,"I like this sequel, but the first is SLIGHTLY better.","I have loved the Tremors movie since I was a little kid, so I was excited to see the sequel. It was just as fun, but it is not as memorable for me as its predecessor. I think I liked the cast of characters as a whole more in the first movie. However, Burt and Earl are still at the top of their game, and I do remember that I found the evolution of the graboids to be an exciting twist the first time I saw the movie. It's a fun film that I think more people should see."
2,Not quite...,"Tremors 2 doesn't live up to what I had hoped for. The movie has its funny moments, but just doesn't hook the viewer like the original. A key ingredient missing in this movie is Kevin Bacon. If you haven't seen the first Tremors, I would strongly recommend NOT viewing the sequel. However, if you enjoyed the first one, the sequel may be worth your time."
3,As Good As The First,"In this sequel, Kevin Bacon's character is long gone - settled down - but Fred Ward is still around, disgruntled and miserable from losing out on the big money deals that came his way after first battling the worms.TREMORS 2 sees Ward's character and a cocky young sidekick taking on a new breed of the worms in Mexico. And once again, that's the plot. Nothing too complicated, which works well for this movie.TREMORS 2 maintains the same quirky humour that made the first movie enjoyable. The characters have no more depth than those in a comic book, but that's perfect - TREMORS 2 seems like a live-action comic fantasy, and can be very funny."
1,"As a sequel, it fails.","Guys, just listen. This isn't a great movie. If you've only seen it, and not the original, it's okay. But to point everyone in the correct direction...buy the original. It's so great and funny. It should have been titled ""Val and Earl"" (The two main characters) rather than ""Tremors."" The character interaction is what made that movie. This film doesn't have, or master, nearly any of those qualities. The original is a barrel of laughs."
1,In denial that there is this/any sequel to Tremors.,"This was oneof the lamest sequels to any given movie. First off, you could tell they wrote around availability. Examples, primary ones. Weren't able to bring back Kevin Bacon but, keep Fred Ward in it, even though the bubby thing between the two was seamless in Tremors. Can't bring Reba back in, well, let's say they were divorsed. Please, that notion is an easy out to admit she wasn't coming back to it.The newer evovled ""tremors"" was a stupid idea. Tremors was called Tremors for a reason, the monsters shook the ground, that registered on the richter scale. These stupid chicken designed ones in 2 takes away fro mthe whole point and the name. Now if it had evolved and was huge, Godzilla size, then it could still be called Tremors, and add to it.My love for the first movie can't be ruined but, 2 doesn't even exist as far as I'm conscerned, it wasn't Tremors and 2 never needed to be made.Honestly, if I could select 0 stars, I would."
3,"Good fun, especially for a direct-to-video sequel.","Fred Ward returns as handyman Earl Bassett, and has just been hired to kill another batch of graboids in a Mexican oil refinery. Everything runs smoothly, until they mutate. Direct-to-video sequel is much better than you might think, with good special effects, good performances (nice chemistry between Ward and Helen Shaver), and a good sense of mindless fun. It takes too long to actually get going (A good 60 minutes before the mutation occurs) but once it does, the last half-hour approaches the same exciting thrills and big laughs the original generated.*** 1/2 out of *****"
4,Good lesser Vladimir,"Vladimir Nabokov is perhaps my very favorite author, and so I approached this work withthe mindset of ""it must be at least good."" It is. It contains the subtlety and puzzling qualities and droll humor of his great works and still manages to work in its own little bit of beauty. It also has its duller stretches, it lacks a real point, and it is more than vaguely pretentious, but nothing unforgivable. As his first full-length work in English, perhaps it should be treated more as an experiment in compositional workability than anything else.The relative ease of reading this as compared to Nabokov's best, like 'Pale Fire' and 'Lolita,' may make it a good introduction to novices."
5,Sebastian Knight was pretty bright,"A book like this is so full of gems that for all intents and purposes it is without flaw. Understanding Sebastian Knight pretty much means understanding how literary genius works. The book is loaded with humour that will be above the head of most err stupid people. I saw Nabokov sitting and smiling at me at times as I read. The world is full of Dr. Goodmann's - that is for sure. Best to take a long time and read this book slowly, out loud of course, doesn't that go without saying?"
3,no batterflies please,"Nabokov intension, until he discovered for himself the wonderful world of pop-culture (cf. Lolita and Ada), was really to describe truth and beauty (see 'Luzhin's defense', 'Gift' etc.) in the tradition of the Old World, and play less with cheep riddles and collective phobias. His dealing with the issue of death, as in 'Ultima Thule' etc., appears also here; the last book written by Knight is, however, written about in a pale and uninspiring way (Nabokov could not make his vision clear?), and, surprisingly for Nabokov, is not free of commonplaces and dejavous. All in all the book is original and interesting, as nearly everything Nabokov wrote. And, by the way, the treatment of the relation narrator-genius (commonplace in itself, unfortunately) looks better than in Mann's Doctor Faustus, where it is taken quite heavily (one does not see the traces of the hammer blows).Side remark: the stars practice is really annoying: isn't there a way to write about books without grading them?"
5,Dragonheart,"What's not to like about these movies. My kids still love them, even as teenagers. They like to watch them over and over."
4,Still a good and enjoying movie!,"The second installment of the Dragonheart Saga is cleary aimed at a younger audience (although the first movie seems to be aimed for people between 12-30, too). Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed Dragonheart 2: A New Beginning, concerning the story, characters, CGI Effects (Drake still looks great altough Draco in the first part looked better :)) and especially the great and majestic Film Music, composed and arranged by newcomer Marc McKenzie (5 Stars for the Music,...). The only thing I found negative is that Drake the young Dragon doesn't really seem to be the main character of the story - he doesn't come up and show himself very much during the movie. And it would have been good to have watched Dragonheart 2: A New Beginning in the cinemas, and NOT on DVD/VHS only. All-in-all: 4 Stars for an enjoying, entertaining and warm-hearted movie!"
1,Nothing Like DragonHeart,I was so looking forward to this movie. What a disappointment. It was NOTHING like the first movie. I guess a good (great)act is hard to follow. If your looking for a good fantasy movie I recommend the origional Dragonheart or Excalubur. If your thinking about purchasing this movie PLEASE rent it first to see if you like it.
3,Entertaining,"This Movies was interesting. you don't really need to see the first one to enjoy it. Although there is some action i wished we could see the dragon, Drake, more often and that the Dragon battle at the end would last longer. Otherwise this movies was pretty good."
4,"Good, but not as good as the original","A New Beginning is a good movie with a good polt, but it has a long way to go before it can surpass the original. The writers did a good job in explaining how another dragon could be alive if Draco was the last. The story is heartwarming, and the action scenes are good. The animation isn't as good as the original either. THis is a great movie for kids to see as it has a good message, but if your looking for another original Dragonheart, then this isn't the mvoie for you!"
3,Go with the original,This movie could have been better. Or not . Anyway the movie does have it`s ups and downs . It`s ups 1# nice martial arts scenes 2# Cool plot twist everything comes together at the end. 3# Nice mythology. The Downs ( there are many) 1# No real explantion for Drake `s exsitits 2# Stableboy and dragon could have been done by other actors 3#You don`t see a true friendship between the boy and the dragon till much later in the movie. 4#Things are a bit sketching with the plot at frist. 5# Draco and bowen a not talked about very much. 6# when they are things sound really off. 7# Could have been longer 8# Can never live up to the original.
5,Aweee! Drake is so cute! ^_^,I loved this movie! If you liked the first one you definately have to see this one. Its totally different but practically as good as the first ^_^ Dragonheart and Dragonheart: a New Begining are my two fave movies! As you can see I am a dragonluver ^_~ Hey I hope this movie is open for sequels :P
1,Draco would not approve of this.,"I am not someone who hates sequals. I absolutly hate the first Dragonheart it is a masterpiece. Great effects, great story, sad ending. It is a five star movie all the way. This is horible. First of all the effects are awful. Many dragon films form the 1960s looked better. Drake looks like a cartoon. The plot is worse then the effects. It involves finding a dragon egg. Where did he come from. The first said draco was the last one. Now this movie said he wasn't. THIS RUINS THE FIRST MOVIE. The acting stinks. I can't believe anyone over the age of 5 would like this... Watch the first Dragonheart."
1,PIECE OF CRAP!,"Dragonheart did not need a sequel. The story was told. It is over. The first movie peaked therfore, end of franchise. This has bad acting, terrible C.G.I., and stupid story. Stick with the first."
3,Better than your average made for video releases,"Dragonheart part 1 is one of my all time favorite movies. When I heard that part 2 was a direct to video release, I didn't know what to expect.I was quite impressed though. The plot is excellent, it is only the unknown actors shoddy acting that ruins things. The animation is quite mediocre, not up to par with the original. The dragon drake, looks like he's come out of a cartoon. Drake is voiced by Robby Benson, while good, he seems lame compared to Sean Connery's Draco.Considering the fact that I liked the plot, I wish they had made this a big budget, made for the silver screen release. A good plot is ruined by bad acting and low production costs. I mean Dragonheart is one of my favorites and I wish they had spent some more money on the sequel.Having said that, this is a good movie to rent. Dunno if i'd buy it though but it is definitely worth watching."
4,Most strips stuck,This was a great way to make the tub safe for our 1 year old. He loves his bath time and we didn't want to restrict him to smaller tubs and convert to the bigger tub later so this was a great option! Thanks 3M for an easy to use product. Only 1 strip didn't stick :)
1,"Either flawed production, or deliberate omission of a key detail","Let me put this in perspective:The description nowhere TELLS YOU that you have to connect the mini-plug into the adapter for the 1/4"" -- duh. Of course it doesn't say so. That's obvious.EQUALLY obvious to anyone who works with audio is that the main plug is (or should be) a 1/8"" (3.5mm). The description nowhere TELLS YOU that, granted. But just as with understanding that one connects the mini into the 1/4, that is a *completely* reasonable inference.So when I found that the small plug would not fit into my laptop, and that only with force would it go into my Zoom H2 (which now I'm afraid I may have damaged), I saw it, in effect, as de facto deception. Either the slightly-longer mini-plug is flawed in production, OR it's a nonstandard size, fitting ONLY their 1/4"" unit.As long as you're OK with always using that bulky 1/4"" thing, and evidently NOT being able to use it with your computer or portable recorder, don't worry."
5,:) It works very good with other products,I am unsure how well it works by itself but for curly hair it seems to help along with other hair products. It will have your curls under control! :D I used it today and plopped my hair and my curls were shiny and soft and tight. I used with it Dr. Bronner's hair rinse and hair creme. :)
4,good product,"This is the only ""natural"" mousse I have tried. I like it! It smells fresh and applies nicely. My hair is fine/curly and this stuff works good. I will stick with this mousse."
5,Its reputation as one of the best scifi stories is not overrated,Herbert's Dune series is a life's work that made the world of literature better. It introduced characters and circumstances that carved out a place for world building and space travel in literature that few other stories ever accomplished.
1,What a let down,"Having only read the two Dune novels and having loved the first one so much, I couldn't believe how dull this one was. What a huge let down. Do I even dare reading the third, fourth and fifth. No; I sleep well enough as it is."
5,If you want to read only one SF-Fantasy book in your life...,"I have read this book 20-25 times, and every time I read it I get something new from it. It's complex themes blend togather perfectly with the books main plot. I particularly loved the philosophy and the treatment of characters and delicate social issues like religon, sexuality and politics. This is a must read for any one, if u read only one SF in your lfie, make sure it is Dune. The only regret that you will have is that the book is only 400 pages."
4,One of the Few True SciFi Masterpieces of the 20th Century,"I'd like to get inside Frank Herbert's brain and find out what planet he came from. You just aren't a normal person if you can create entire worlds (and a universe) and make an epic saga out of it.Although the story behind Dune has distinctive political/economic flair to it (centered around the spice and spice mining), it's so much more than that. The inclusion of the Fremen prophecy regarding the coming of the ""One"" (a.k.a., Quisatz Haderach; hope I spelled it right) the mental capabilities of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and the Machine building Tleilaxu cilvilization bring entirely new depth to this enigmatic futuristic world. The story is quite complex and the reader should vigilantly read to grasp all the details. (I'm not going to give away the story, just read the book)."
4,A great book if the movie got you interested,"Ok, I admit it I love science fiction. I love this series, but I would have never gotten into it if I hadn't seen the movie first. This book is a great way to dive further into the Dune unverse but beware it is long and sometimes a bit slow. The following books aren't much better especially if the first one didn't do it for you. I highly recommend this book to anyone who really liked the movie. If you are a science fiction fan who hasn't seen the movie I suggest reading Dune : House Atreides by Brian Herbert, first. Then decide if you want to pursue the series."
5,The best book ever written,"I only read Dune this year, but I ended up reading it two timesin a row. This is, by far, the best book ever written in humanhistory. I've made Dune my Holy Book. I've never seen /anything/ as richly detailed in politics, religion, and description as Dune."
2,Dull,This is one of those rare occasions where the movie is actually better than the book! The author spent to much time describing the sand and other such nonsense. Bot the politics of the book and the Fremen people were pretty cool.
2,A story as lush as the planet it is set on!,"Come on! This book is over rated. It is an amusing story but unengaging. The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them. I did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved...but it wasn't, it turned into the X-files! i.e. continuous suspense, convolutions, but no resolution. A story must have a beginning, middle, and, and, um, an end? The recent appearance of the Dune 'brand extension' books ""House Atreides"" and "" 'Harkonen"" confirm that the story continues, be it chronologically before or after the original Dune. Should have been a trilogy at most."
3,A necessary coda to a masterpiece,"After reading Dune you just want more of that universe no? It was to sci-fi literature what Star Wars was to sci-fi films. This sequel is short, has very little action, has nowhere near the scope of the first book, but was interesting to read none the less, because it expanded upon the Dune universe. We do get to see Paul's character evolve, but other than that, no other characters seem to be developed very well at all (with the exception of the ghola Idaho). Where was Jessica for example? - and Chani, Stilgar, etc. seem to be glossed over. I wish Herbert would have doubled the size of this book, and maybe then it would have seemed less like a quickie coda."
4,kinda complicated but worth it,"I really actually liked reading Dune. It was full of many complicated things that stacked up and stacked up. But it also keeps you hooked. The story line was good and I thought that it all tied together very well in the end. It made me want to finish it to see what would happen in the end. Its a book you have to read over and over again to really understand it and to really catch it all, in a year or two I will probably go back and read it again."
5,This book was great!!,"I read Dune when I was in middle school. My dad suggested it. I loved it!! In some points, it was hard to understand, and in others, it almost scaired me, because of the amount of suspence. Frank Herbert had a very complex imagination while writing Dune. There are only two kinds of people, I believe, that could write a book as interesting as Dune. Either a genious or a lunitic. and I don't believe Frank Herbert to be a lunatic!"
5,The all time classic Sci-Fi Novel,This is a must have. I'd even say one of the best novels ever written. The idea behind the entire Dune Universe is tremendously well worked out. Frank Herbert's craftmanship is to be studied for ages if you ask me. Many popular sci-fi and fantasy novels haven't got more to tell than the neverending fight between good and evil. The good is white and the bad is black - how very boring. Frank Herbert paints us a universe that is so detailed in both characterization and storyline that it truely becomes real. Marvellous!!!
3,"Great book, poor publisher","As stated in most of the reviews, Dune is a must read for sci-fi fans. I don't want to comment on the story as much as the publisher of this specific book. I purchased a hardcover because I can usually count on a higher quality printing. However, I was discouraged by this book's lack of quality. There were many misspelled words and the printing of letters was incomplete, leaving the bottom portion of a letter but not the top. Overall, I would recommend purchasing Dune, but not from this publisher."
5,Price?,"Why is this e-book $16 and the actual book can be picked up for $3 at betterworldbooks.com? This is nothing short of ridiculous price gouging. Shame, this is the reason why most people haven't made the switch from paper and ink to kindle.."
3,"A complete departure stylistically, yet worth reading","I put this book down the first time I attempted to read it simply because the first book had such a triumphant ending that the dark nature of 'Dune Messiah' just didn't work for me. I had attempted to read this book just having completed the first one. My second attempt came two months later and this time I read it entirely in a matter of days. I'm glad I did. 'Dune' is an epic in every sense of the word. 'Dune Messiah' is anything but an epic. It is a singular story dealing mostly with the inherent problems of religion and politics becoming one. Paul struggles with the consequenses of the jihad yet feels powerless to stop it. He is nothing more than a figurehead to his Qizara and wants to be free of this and the burden of prescience. I don't wish to give anything away but this book is worth reading if only for the fantastic ending. And by the way, 'Children of Dune' is a return to the epic style with which 'Dune' was written."
1,"great book, outrageous kindle price. Shame on Penguin","""Dune"" is a wonderful book. I read it years ago and loved Herbert's talent for world-building. ""Fear is the mindkiller..."" is a mantra that I've used over and over.So why am I giving it a 1 star rating? Like other Kindle readers, I'm appalled at the price, which is actually higher than the price for the hardback. As other reviewers have pointed out, the Kindle edition is also highly flawed--formatting and spelling errors abound. Is it so much to ask the publisher to get it right? Also, this is a 40 year old book. Penguin has no business charging this much for a non-print edition of a book that is readily available in multiple editions used and is ten bucks new in paper."
1,Cost of the Kindle version,Why is the kindle version more expensive than a hard copy? I thought it was suppose to go the other way! Don't get it. Could someone explain this phenomenon.
1,"A Great Book, Horrible Price","I had this book. I've read it twice. When I moved I left it so that the next person would be able to read it and enjoy it, knowing that I would probably get a digital version the next time I wanted to read it. $14.99 for a 40 year old book that can be picked up in innumerable used book stores? That much for a book that is 40 years old? There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version. Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass. I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet. Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake. Set a reasonable price for this book, and I'd happily purchase it!"
1,The Kindle edition is still chock full o' errors.,The re-listed Kindle edition of this book still contains a ridiculous number of typographical errors.
4,Terrible publishing,"The story is great. But the price is wrong. The publisher has no printing cost, no distribution cost, and worst of all no one bothered to proof read it."
2,Dune,"Many readers often incorrectly guess the title as being inspired by the desert regions of Saudi Arabia. While the massive machines of the oil refineries of Arabia and the Northwest are in part, the author was more inclined towards the fragile ecology of the duneform stuctures near Reedsport, Oregon ...Often difficult to suppose the author's real meaning.Interesting book."
1,Nice but slow reading,"Lot's of hype, good substance/plot/characters, but no suspense. There is a lot to slog through and this book is slow reading. I did have to put it down after ^150 pages because after a while, I just wasn't interested. Who are these Dune cultists? Living in a big city, I can't say I've met one."
3,Hugely Overrated by a Nostalgic Older Crowd,"I can see how this book was once considered great, just like Star Wars once had the best special effects and the Cubs were once a good baseball team... A LONG TIME AGO. Modern readers will likely find Dune slow paced, overly ambitious, and mediocre at best."
2,Boring and Disappointing,"A famous quote in the book is, ""Fear is the mind-killer"". I agree if you fear reading boring books as alternative to treating insominia.There were some good parts of the book that sparked interest, but they were few and far in between.I read the marketing ploys trying to convince the LOR fans that Dune was their science fiction savior. It's pure nonsense.What I can't understand is how overrated this book was. Even English majors I know gave me positive accounts of this book."
2,"Go ahead, click ""not helpful...""","...but I honestly don't see what's so great about this book. Daniel Keyes' ""Flowers for Algernon"" and Arthur C. Clarke's ""Childhood's End"" are both better science fiction stories than Dune. They make powerful, emotional statements about the human condition without rambling on incessingly or clogging the pages with useless action scenes. If you want epic literature, read Lord ot the Rings. That story about an innocent hobbit thrown into a destructive war is a million times more epic and personable than this rambling nonsence about a superhuman destined for greatness since birth. Everything is predictable about the plot, not to mention the fact that Paul is next to impossible to relate to.On the other hand, Frank Herbert DID exert a lot of artistic effort into this, which is to be commeneded. Perhaps he should have exerted this effort into a better idea."
1,unbelievably boring and tedious description without end,A friend told me that DUNE was different from the run of the mill sci-fi endless spillage of adverbs and adjectives. After three chapters of the most tedious and unnecessary descriptions of the tiniest details I decided he didn't know what he was talking about. Boring junk with a capital J!
4,"Confusing but still Interseting,","I found this book to be quite confusing. Evertything happens very fast and then cuts to a different seen. However, I thought that it was a very well written sci-fi novel. It is full of action and suspense. It also delves very deep into religion and philosphy. I thought that the characters were written in very good detail which is, in my opinion, the best part of the book. This a book that I would not recommend for many people. I would only recommend this for science-fiction readers that also have an interest in philosophy. Overall, this was a very well written novel and interesting novel."
2,Not a Fun Read,"You have to give Frank Herbert credit for having a great imagination and stamina. That's about all you have to give him credit for.The plot is cumbersome. The characters have no charisma. The whole idea of this high culture developing on this barren rock seems pretty far-fetched. Herbert's invented ceremonies and cultural mores are wonderful, but they can't support the bloated story and anemic characters. Masochism not being my strong suit, I gave up on this one after about a hundred pages."
2,way over rated,It really puzzles me how this book could have so many five stars. How a slow book like this could achieve a rating close to Ender's Game is indeed quite incomprehensible. Are there many fans from the 1960s editions rating it?
2,zzzzzzzzz,"How can anyone find Dune to be entertaining. Frank Herbert rambles on incessantly about politics, religion, and society. There is little action and Herbert never goes into detail about the technologies of his universe. However, he never seems to shut up about his philosophy either. This is a VERY tedious book. The concept is quite fascinating, but the book itself lacks the entertainment factor."
2,No-go at this station.,"I can't help but feel the need to write a less-than-memorable review on these books of Frank Herbert. I'm on the verge of giving it away, but if you read them, over %90 of them are people sitting on rock ledges or balconies thinking of plans and plans and plans. The action scenes seemed to be written as if they were afterthoughts, almost a ""by the way"" feeling. The characters were elaborate, but making them ACT was impossible, and that's why I gave the whole Dune series 2-stars instead of one. If you're thinking about reading them, ask someone who has already read them and then get a summary; it'll be quicker."
3,OK but no Lord of the Rings,DUNE was an ok book. I read it once and that was enough but it was rather enjoyable.However Mr Herbert seemed to want to invent a religion based on the Holy Scriptures (he used enough Bible references!) but without its discipline. He failed.As for Huge on Brazil if that is the kind of person who recommends this book -- don't bother. But I rather think that he is making fun of the book.Dune is ok but IT AINT THAT GREAT.
2,There are better choices out there,"Having been recommended by friends as a must read in the sci-fi genre, I finished reading the original Dune trilogy, expecting something spectacular. Unfortunately, I found myself disappointed and want my time back :).Herbert has created a colorful and exotic world. The writing is very detailed. However, I found the series to have too much pretentious babble with little real substance behind it. The first book, Dune, is the best book of series. The second is barely readable. The third one bored me to tears at times. For a classic sci-fi series with real plot twisters (or ""a feint within a feint within a feint"" in Herbert's words) and intelligent discussions, read Isaac Asimov's Robot series and Foundation series. For a fantasy series with enticing plots and moving character, read Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy."
4,"good book, minor formatting errors","*Slight spoiler alert*This is not a normal review. Due to the fact this book is decades old, and is far from new. This version is just the kindle version. This is more of a format review. In this edition, there is a wonderful intro by Frank Herbert's son Brian. It is truly written by a son that is proud of his father. If your a Dad, be prepared to cry.I was a little disappointed with the book formatting though. Every once in awhile there are are sentences split in half, leaving some awkward spaces. Other than that, it's good. The story hasn't changed, so if you were among the many that hated this book back in the day, you'll still hate it.OverallI give this ebook 4 out of 5 stars."
5,Nicely Done,"I enjoyed this book to be sure, and although it was quite lengthy, I found myself unable to part with it easily. I finished it within a week simply because the story was so gripping. I'm not sure how Herbert manages it, but it seems that he can endlessly descibe something yet never bore someone. Highly Recommended."
3,Pretty good but not the greatest,"Dune was pretty good, but I don't think it is the greatest book I've ever read. It started off well, but it seemed like the last part of the book was rushed with the author jumping over large periods of time. I also had difficulty finding any characters that I could really like. They all seemed a little shifty. I will probably eventually read the rest of the books to see what happens, but I won't be rushing out to buy them."
2,It;s just not very good,"I read the Dune novels as a teenager and recently started re-reading them 15 years later.Dune Messiah is exactly as I remembered it: a disappointment not just in comparison to Dune, but a true mediocrity in its own right, with a surprising amount of fragements of thoughts and ruminations that just don't make any sense. The point of Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune, is to enjoy the much grand God-Emperor of Dune."
5,this is the book I'll take to the desert island!!!,"Well, this is simply the best book I've read EVER, starting the best SF series ever written by the human being. The plot is awesome, the scenery is witty, the writing is simply splendid... If you'll ever plan to go to the desert island, this is the definite no. 1 choice."
5,More then FINE It is SHEDERVAU,"I am Russian man And Live in Kazachstan. I ret DUne approx 4 yeras ago And I fallen love in this book I not ret only last book about DUNE By Russian it called Brotherhood of Dune When I ret Children of Dune I begin to search film by D. Lynch ""Dune"" When i did it I saw this one 20 times in same day!!!!"
3,Dune,"The book, Dune, written by Frank Herbert was interesting novel. This book was good, although at times it was confusing. Herbert takes you into his imagination which allows your mind to run wild. Many times i was lost because his world is nothing like we know the world as it is today. This book is in the future and is based upon a war over spices. In which, a man, Paul fights against the emperor. If you want to read something which allows your mind to run wild this is a book for you."
5,!!!The God of good books!!!,"GREAT BOOK. Love the way Herbert has made up a ""new"" religion, based on Islam and Christianety...It gives the reader a perfect picture into a futur, where humans relly more on other people, then robots. Also the part about ""making a perfect humaniod"" is great."
4,"Sci fi master, book binding disaster","Dune is simply amazing. The book is even more in depth than the movies. I had never read the books before, but I recently saw the Children of Dune mini-series, and it got me interested. I'm sorry I didn't pick up this book sooner, it's excellent.The sad part is, that the mass market paper back edition is poorly produced. My main gripe is that the margin is way to close to the binding of the book. I have to come close to destroying the thing just to bend the book open enough so I can so those words down the inside edge of the paper.I heavily reccomend Dune to anyone who's a sci fi fan. I also reccomend picking up a different printing of the book."
5,Dune - Spice of the Day,"Probably the best of his works, Frank Herbert's DUNE is a masterpiece by a master of authors. The story line is rich, with realistic characters portraying people as they really are and not loaded with sugarcoated individuals that survive the entire book and the next four in the series. It begins with Paul Atreides being brought to the desert planet Arrakis, the sole producer of spice, by his father the Duke Leto Atreides. Ambushed in a strange world with his father killed, Paul is taken in by the desert Fremen to become the Kwizatz Haderach... This book can only be compared to Herbert's The Godmakers, another one of Herbert's greatest works. I am also a fan of John Robert Reule (J.R.R.) Tolkien, Tom Clancy, and Clive Cussler; Herbert is one of my favorite authors among the few whose books I look for."
5,Awesome,"Is this book great, or what? But seriously, it is a rare insight into the bitter rewards of power, along with all the other levels this book has to offer. Religeon; how much of this is created, & how much is self-creating. Economics; Muad'Dib - the supreme energy eater. Politics: Bene Tlalaxu, Bene Gesserit, House Atredies, The House of Ix, The Fremen, The Guild, oh yeah. Finally, this concludes the story of Paul Atredies (The Preacher is another story...) who sought to make his future, only to find his future made him."
2,the movie was better,"If you have never read this book, here it is...Dune... Arabs in space, some of whom are on drugs.Humanity devolves back into tribalism/feudalism, with attendant problems of religion and war. Dark, cult-ish, historical hodgepodge, all in sci-fi drag.Sorry, but throwing in some spaceships and anti-grav gadgets doesn't qualify Dune as a science fiction story. This story is simply a relic of the hippie-dippy culture... toss out rationality and other elements of modern civilization, and substitute supposed mind-expanding drugs, Eastern mysticism, and revolution.If that sounds like something you would enjoy (perhaps if you're an old hippie, or a ""turn on, drop out"" type) go for it.The movie was beautifully done, however. Even Frank liked it. Only problem with it was the story."
3,Good... To a point,"This book is good enough for someone to read if they aren't busy, and are almost bored out of their minds, and if they don't stop reading this book, they will end up finishing it without a problem. The only problem that I have with this book are with the rest of the series, which seems to be milking his worlds for all that they are worth, and in retrospect, I realize that I have read books that are a lot better.If you like politics, this book would seem a lot better to you. I can understand the politics, but it doesn't seem to really interest me all that much. I also like fantasy books more than science fiction, and I would rather have the main character that seems all-powerful to have some more impressing abilites than to simply see into the future, and then to find out that he isn't the only one that can do that in the universe made it almost like he wasn't THAT special, and was simply the right person in the right place at the right time."
2,"Sorry, but I really didn't like it very much","I guess it's just personal taste, but I'm sorry to say that I did not really like Dune that much. I really wanted to; I know it has a great reputation, and legions of fans who have read it multiple times. I just finished reading it last night. The overall setting and the complex story were fine. The opening scene, the visit from the Reverend Mother, was intriguing. But, somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just didn't click with me. You know how some books have wonderfully-crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you? Well, this book was not like that. Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded. As well, while there was a great assortment of characters, I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.I had previously read a couple of Herbert's sci-fi novels, and liked them, but this one, well, doesn't get 5 stars from me. Your mileage may vary...I won't be reading any of the remaining books."
5,it's a godly work!,"i've read the negative reviews and could not believe my eyes! some people compared this series to the LOTR! first LOTR is not SCIENCE FICTION you idiots! it's FANTASY at it's best!!second i hate people who write a review without even reading the whole book! i've read all six of the original dune novels and the ones frank herbert's son wrote and i think all 11 books are great, especially the original novels..this series is not for novice sci-fi readers! so if you are new to this genre stay away from these books or if you don't like them keep your thoughts for yourself!"
3,"Very imaginative, vivid images, quite a fantastique world","This is one of those situations where I actually preferred the movie to the book. Although the book gave much more background than the movie, it was much easier to follow the book after having seen the movie. I think if I had read the book first, I would have been lost completely. The movie is also part of my permanent collection. I mean, who could resist Kyle McLachlan as the Kwizatz Had'arrach?"
1,Buy this book at amazon.co.uk for HALF PRICE!!!,Ridiculous pricing here.Get an Amazon.co.uk account. Change your Kindle Registration to the address of a friend in the UK. Buy the SF Masterworks Kindle edition of Dune for 4.99 ($8.00 US)This is what I would do if I didn't still have a paperback version of this book handy. Does it violate any policies? I don't know. But I certainly felt violated when I saw Penguin's price for this e-book.
2,Disappointing,"I am an avid SF Fan who has long been about to read ""Dune"", and this summer I finally started. I really had high expectations, especially after reading all the raving reviews in this forum.Sadly, I found this book hard to get into, slow-paced and a little too confused to really catch my interest. I made it through just because I felt I had to, and was actually relieved when it finally ended and I could start reading the next book that I had in line waiting for me. Not recommended!"
5,It's Dune...Top Notch,"I bought this for Kindle, so I have yet been able to recognize the benefit or difference of this version (40th Anniversary) vs. previous versions. As for the book itself, it had been a while since I had read it. Again, Frank Herbert is absolutely amazing in creating the Dune universe...many levels superior to the ""clever"" sci-fi"" prevalent today. My favorite aspect of the Dune series is the contemplation of humans moving toward the Omega Moment, or in other words the process by which humans could evolve in virtual gods. This is a topic that Herbert covered in other non-Dune books that he wrote as well. It is a topic that is more and more discussed even by serious scientists and philosophers in light of discoveries of the epigenome among the fundamental nature of the universe. Herbert was way ahead of his time."
4,Dune,"The book of Dune is a well thought up book. It is deep it went over my head a lot of the time. Dune is book about a boy that is the age of 14-15. He taught me that fear cannot affect the way do things, if you always think positive. Paul grew up learning from the best, I think that is the way that things should be learning from the best and practicing every day. This alows you to be the best. I liked the principal of being the Messiah you knew that he would not really die. The part that I really did not like is trieing to understand the new words and their definitions and picture that in my mind Eric C"
5,THIS is the masterpiece of Science-Fiction,"I'am a science-fiction fan and I have read lots of very good books, but Dune is by far the best. I have never read such a good book. It has everything : Action, philosophy, psychology, everything is perfect. If I had to choose through my (big) collection of SF books, I would take this one without any hesitation. Really, there is no word to describe how fantastic it is."
3,doesn't live up to the expectations,This is the book about the reign of Paul and his sister Alia. I think it lacks A LOT of Dunes dense atmosphere. A disapointment. The thoughts and thinkings of the main characters are severly reduced. The plot itself is also not nearly as intriguing as in Dune (I even have some trouble recalling it). Perhaps it would have been preferable that Dune would have remained as a finished work itself? I wouldn't have missed Dune Messiah
5,"""Dune""amic!","Thanks to this book, I have a hard time picking a favorite story. I no longer want to be a jedi, but a Fremen leader! Such a great story, that you will keep it in the front of your library so you can read it again, and again"
2,Not as good as the first book,"Dune Messiah was a bit of a boring and wordy book. It mostly has to do with the rule of Paul Mau'dib and his reign as Emperor over Dune and the universe. Plots to remove him from his position as a godhead are formulated and carried out by people all around. Basically, it was a good story, but dry and boring in comparison to Dune. Read the book if you plan to continue with the Dune Chronicles like I have."
4,Good book!,"I liked Dune and so far I'm liking Children of Dune better then Dune Messiah, that's why I only gave it 4 stars. It was a great book that bridges the stories in Dune and Children of Dune well. You have to read this book if you want to be well read in the classics of Science Fiction. Frank Herbert is an awesome writer and this was a very enjoyable tale. Its made more enjoyable by the fact that it is the prerequisite to reading Children of Dune, which is GREAT!"
5,The Supreme Science Fiction Story,"Dune is the best hard science fiction novel that I ever read. Frank Herbert's deep understanding of issues range from economics all the way to desert tundra. The center plot of Paul of Atrides measures easily with the epic sagas of antiquity. Majestic heroes, horrendous villains, an exotic environment, terrible wars, court backstabbing, messianic thrills, WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK?I read it back in College, and after countless SCFI stories this is easily the best one."
3,I had expected more but a good read wnyway.,"Although the scope seems limited compared to Dune, there is plenty of intrigue to captivate readers. While not as gripping as Dune itself, Dune Messiah features new faces and new places, as well as old friends. I found it somewhat disjointed to begin but as the final chapters approached and the senarios emerged I couldn't put the book down."
2,Not worth the money,"While Dune was rich in historical and sociological vision (a pun), Dune Messiah is a poorly executed commercial sequel. Readers of Dune can explore age old conflicts based upon wealth, power, and religion. Herbert uses the planet Dune to retell the story of religious incarnation and to explore the conflict between religion and power without the baggage of historical and religious bias. While Dune Messiah promises to continue the brillant story telling of Dune, the characters become one dimensional. Instead of exploring religious conflict, Dune Messiah wastes the time of its readers in living Paul's drug induced hallucinations."
4,Good,"This book is a really good science fiction novel. Hard to start and get into because the writer created his own world and terminology (I suggest reading a few of the appendixes and checking out the glossary at the back), but really worth the trouble."
5,Bought it!,"Okay now I have all of the Dune series from way back-but, I did go an purchase the new hardcovers with Brian Herbert's Introductions-They are so wonderful to read! The book is exquisite."
3,Herbert's worst is still pretty good,"For some reason, this book didn't turn out so well. As a die-hard Dune fan, I read this book just twice. I re-read the whole series every year, but I skip this one and never miss it. Children of Dune gives you enough plotline information that it's not really necessary to ever open Dune Messiah. If you haven't read this one yet, skip it and just go to the incredible #3."
5,a staggering creation of an entire cosmic culture,"This is the original, astonishingly intricate construction of a complete universe, painting a bright allegory of good and evil;giving breath to a wealth of characters that incorporate all the qualities of epic figures ranging from Moses on the mountain to Lucifer after his plunge."
3,Good messages,"I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. The premise was very creative. There were some good messages about preparing for the future, and refraining before showing anger."
4,Slow in areas but still a great work.,"I was hesitant to read this book because I had seen the disastrous movie several years earlier.However, I can testify that David Lynch made absolutely no effort whatsoever to turn the book into a script. He just filmed portions of the book being ""acted out"", almost at random. The result: surprise...the movie made no sense.The book is quite a masterful piece of writing, describing an outer space society that has a fully explained economy and political structure, all while maintaining a good pace given the inherent dryness of many of the topics involved.Subsequent attempts to make a decent movie from the material also failed...but it remains a very good book."
5,Dune,The best SF book ever written and thats saying something as I have been reading and collecting SF books for over 50 years... I just wish that his son Biran was half the writter that Frank was... Anyway I love the entire series.
2,A mere shadow of the magnificence that was Dune.,"Unfortuantly, Dune Messiah does not live up to Dune. Dune I gave five stars, however, this book does not go in depth about anything. It merely skimms the top of everything and doesn't explain or explore as well as it could have, and should have.Dune Messiah attempts to build on Dune, the ultimate in sci-fi, and fails miserably. Instead of bettering the Dune story, it weakens it with bad plot twists that are nothing like that of Dune.I had trouble reading the end of this book because it starts out slow, and doesn't improve. It laggs through the whole story whereas Dune the origional glued you to the book.Finally, Messiah mocks the origional Dune by weakenning the structure with which Dune was created and the glory was origionally born.So if you're looking to find the magic that Dune brought, don't read Massiha, it just doesn't live up to the name Dune."
3,Does not hit par with foundation,"Sure the book had some good concepts but the way the author had to constanly remind me that paul was a hero, got a bit on my case. Also the man managed to write a 500 page novel in which hardly anything takes palce. Having read foundation by asimov i find that this collection is paled in comparison. The work was creative but not creative enough to be hailed like the way it is."
1,Great book: worst narrator!,This is indeed one of the best science fiction works produced however I must give it a miserable review on account of the almost criminal selection of narrators! There are a great many text to speech programs available which offer a more enjoyable listening experience! I am no stranger to audiobooks but this one is almost unbearable to listen to on account of the deplorable narration!
4,Not as good as Dune but still good.,"I loved Dune but this book does make a good addition to the Dune books, it was a little slower in pace and to much politics but the scheming and lies were absolutly brilliant, if you've read Dune and liked it why not go ahead and read the entire series."
5,Timeless masterpiece,"Dune is without a doubt one of the best novels ever to be written. It takes the reader far off into the future where space travel is made possible by a substance called the spice melange, only available from a single planet in the known universe, planet Arrakis, also known as Dune.Long before Dune there was a Butlerian Jihad when artifficial intelligence threatened to end human life. Ever since, computers have been banned, high technology being replaced by other means, specially trained humans acting as computational minds.Intriguing and original concepts. Frank Herbert writes about many different aspects thus painting a comprehensive and complete picture of his vision.A must read not only for the sci-fi fan."
5,BEST SCI-FI BOOK EVER!,"Well if not book definately series. This is an addictive series. a must for anyone who calls themselves a sci fi fan, and anyone who doesn't! This was very real and detailed. Frank Herbert really understands human nature. The only problem is that there are no sentient species. Odds are there would be at least one in the universe. Otherwise great book."
5,Perfect!,Exellent product! It's perfect conditions and is that I've was searching for.. =) I'm really very happy whit this book! Here in my country I can't find it..Exellent product! It's perfect conditions and is that I've was searching for.. =) I'm really very happy whit this book! Here in my country I can't find it..
5,A masterpiece,"This, the first installment of the best selling Dune series. Is, and will always be, a true masterpiece. The complex characters and locations make the reader captivated. This book is a must read."
5,This masterpiece is one incredible spiritual trip,"Well,what can i say that hasn't been said already this is as i said is one incredible spiritual adveture for the your mind,one big spiritualistic trip on a foreign desert world. truly a classic masterpiece."
4,THIS NOVEL IS BOUND TO BE A GREAT ONE!!!,"I have just begun DUNE (I'm only on Chapter 3) and its already captivating me. The concepts and ideas in this novel are extremely intelligent but a slight bit tedious and complex. If you ask me, DUNE is not as much of a Sci-fi novel as it is a Fantasy one; but still, quite a bit of it is Sci-fi material. Herbert really does great on this magnificent piece of classic Sci-fi literature!"
2,Deadly boring,"This book is supposed to be the most sold science fiction novel in the world. It's beyond my comprehension. I loved the computer game and the movie was OK, but in spite of several frantic attempts I couldn't force myself to finish the book. There's simply nothing going on in it!"
2,Dune [Abridged] - Audiobook,"This is not a review of Dune, per se, about which I cannot say enough good things. The audiobook, however, is extremely disappointing--at least relative to expectations. It is not an abridged version of Dune. It is a set of selected readings: it only contains four random selections for a total of 3.5 hours, drawn from across the entire original trilogy. My understanding of abridged is that a twelve hour or so book is reduced to eight or nine hours--usually done with audio books to make the story flow better to a listening audience. While it is very interesting to hear Frank Herbert read selected passages, this tape will not give you Dune."
1,Not the best,"I had great expectations when I picked this book up from the store last month. This book is okay, but certainly not ""the best"" as many claim. My suspicion is that people on this review site tend to be a small but determined bunch of supporters. The biggest flaw is that the book is boring. It truly is difficult to keep turning the page. After being 1/2-way through, I just had to toss the book out. If you scroll through the ""real"" reviews, you will find this is a common lament. Also, it doesn't have the same emotional life as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and does not draw one in. Dune is certainly not in the same league as Tolkien's works."
1,"Good idea, but bad book...","I know this is considered a classic and one of the supreme Sci-Fi novels of all time and that's why I was excited to read it. However, I found it boring and disjointed. Some of the characters are interesting and the story has it's moments but it's not worth the time it takes to read it. The story spends too much time building up to events which are either unsatisfying or over the top. The main character was extremely shallow and what personality he did have was still obscure. I didn't care for him at all. He seemed to be as bored as I was with the things going on around him. The book had good concepts but they were never really put to good use. I really wanted this book to be good. I was on it's side to begin with, but now I can see why Herbert had such a hard time finding someone to publish it."
1,Boring,"Clearly, you have to be a fan of the robot genre to remotely even come close to liking this book. The first chapter gets off to a very slow start, the storyline becomes boring rapidly, and after a while, the book is unreadable. I would imagine that those disappointed with this highly overrated book would turn to other science fiction. Lord of the Rings puts this book to shame. J.R.R. Tolkien makes this author look unimaginative to say the least. If you want real science fiction, start with The Hobbit and go onto the LORD OF THE RINGS. Put this book where it belongs: in the GARBAGE bin."
3,Fine Fiction: Aesthetical Failure,"This was a great book in terms of the plot and such, but let's be honest here: this book is ugly. Seriously, as soon as my divorce is finalized (of which I partially blame this book and others of the like) and I start dating again, I will destroy this book. When I start bringing girls back to my apartment again, do I really want them to see this. The girl will ask ""Oh, I didn't know you were into Egyptology, that's hot.""Then I'll have to say, ""Nah, baby, that ain't about old Egypt; that's a science fiction epic about human houses several thousand years in the future fighting over control of a desert world that is infested with car-eating worms and Tuskan-raiders.""Also, the part about the worms was really lame. Ripping off Star Wars isn't cool."
1,Ghastly,"A hatful of people with unreadable alien names, and a central character called Paul. Vastly advanced civilisations who retain a totally monarchic society. Never have so many dreadful Science Fiction cliches been brought together in one book. Ghastly."
3,Kindle Version Review,"While I would regularly rate this book 5 stars, the Kindle version is very poorly edited, and formating and spelling errors occur regularly. Words with missing spaces in between them show up on almost every other page. Just because something is in a digital format doesn't mean the publisher gets a pass on, what should be, run of the mill quality control for every single book they put out.Also, a note to Amazon. Book reviews need to be separated by format and editions. I cannot stress this enough. My complaints about this book are irrelevant to anyone who's not looking at the Kindle version, yet it will show up as a review for all versions of this book. This is a particular problem with popular public domain books, like Pride and Prejudice, that have multiple releases from different publishers, all with varying quality of of formating and editing, yet still share reviews."
1,Kindle version,"I have climbed out of bed to write this for you, because I can take it no longer. Whoever made the kindle version should be fired. The book itself is great. However, random missing spaces, extra spaces, italics that begin or end when they shouldn't, mis-spellings of stillsuit as ""stulsuit""....Please, buy another version. This is an embarrassment to e-publishing....and you'd think with it being on the computer it'd be easier to check for errors. Guess not.Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Dune."
3,"Initially slow, but a MUST-READ for ""Dune"" enthusiasts!","In comparison to the original ""Dune"", ""Dune: Messiah"" is a lot slower and takes more dedication. After immediately reading it, I was a bit disappointed, but that was before finishing the other books. ""Dune: Messiah"" now reveals itself to me as a gateway into a larger universe as envisioned by Frank Herbert. It foreshadows events that take place in the following books (not necessarily in order) in detail so that one might better understand Muad'Dib and how he is a springboard for all that happens with his son Leto and beyond.If you casually enjoyed ""Dune"", I do not recommend ""Dune: Messiah"" as it requires reading the following books to fully understand. If you were enthralled by ""Dune"", and intend to read the entire saga however, reading this book is a MUST. It is necessary to understand and enjoy the following four novels."
4,"Great story, but no match for the original.","Dune Messiah is a much less ambitious book that its predecessor, but that doesn't mean it comes short as one of the greatest sci-fi books ever. Much shorter than ""Dune"", this sequel focuses on just a couple of storylines at a time, and basically serves its purpose: present the outcome of Paul Muadib as ruler of the universe and prepare us for the coming of his children, whose actions, narrated on the forecoming novels, are the real juice of the saga. Anyway, Dune Messiah has a simple, entertaining story, but you certainly can't stop there. In order to find out what's the destiny of the universe, you need to read the ones that follow this sequel."
2,Embarrassing Ebook,"After reading the Kindle sample of this book, I have to agree with the many critical reviews of this edition. This is not a review of the writing, which is excellent, but of this electronic edition of the title.Aside from the fact that $15 for the electronic edition of a book that is over 40 years old and has already been widely published as a mass market paperback for for half the price is obscene, the quality of this Kindle edition is so horrible I would not want it if it was free. DUNE is one of the great classics of scifi literature but this ebook is an embarrassment to both the publisher and the author and I would urge anyone interested in reading this book to pass on this edition. Instead, find any one of the cheap tens of thousands of used copies that are easily available of this title."
3,"Great story, poor quality paperback","I am not making a comment on the story, but if you love this book and you're thinking of buying it, don't get this edition. The book is not very sturdy and is poorly bound. Let's face it, it's a big book! And it needs to be well made so that the binding doesn't break halfway through the book. :("
4,Sword of Damocles,"Dune Messiah, the follow-up to Dune takes place 12 years after the end of the first book. Paul is now emperor and is finding that the real challenge is not gaining an empire, but ruling it. He has become cynical and disillusioned, as plots against him abound and the jihad continues.Although Dune Messiah is an enjoyable sequel it lacks the sweep and grandeur of Dune, while keeping its complexity. In Dune Messiah the complexity is the result of Herbert just not fleshing out the story enough. I've read the novel twice and I still don't understand exactly the nature of the conspiracy against Paul. Why the stoneburner if Duncan Idaho was programmed to kill Paul. Why did Paul feel that Chani's death was necessary? What was the point of the dwarf? It seemed as if Herbert had more in mind than he put on paper, and the reader is left to fill in the blanks."
3,Best Book ever!,"This is not my favorite book, that would be Enders Game. But this is the best book ever. Sound like a contradiction? It's not. Enders Game is my favorite for some sentimental reasons best left to another forum. Dune is, quite simply, the most complete novel ever written. It has everything!The one downside to this tale are the names. Come on, we don't need some guy who's name has 27 consonants in it. Let's just call him Bob for expediency, shall we?Otherwise, this book has it all. Read it, and you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it."
1,This may be the biggest disappointment for a sequal... ever!,"Dune has about seven interweaving plot layers. This book has maybe one, which is life and death. At just 278 pages this book is by far the shortest book in the six book series. If you've loved Dune, you'll probably hate the sequal so don't read it."
1,Dune,I own the Kindle Fire. Why should I have to pay more for an e-book then one thats actually printed and shipped and stored? Thats crazy.
3,Not the same book that won the Hugo Award,"I first read an Ace printing from the late 60's early 70's., so many years ago. I just read a ""newer"" edition. They aren't the same book?! It's like someone came and changed Huck Finn... ha,ha... I know he tried to make it ""better""... more literary, but he took out Paul's humanity and replaced it with a Messiah. It was more of a love story in a very strange culture with more mystical stuff about the spice and the second moon. There was a sound weapon that has disappeared completely as well. In my opinion he ruined it by messing with it? He lived too long and tried to make perfection better...It reminds me of the pigs in animal farm who can in the night and changed the laws on the wall.We should go back to that Ace edition.... the laws were better."
2,Not so great,"Like many other of the reviewers listed here, I decided to read this book based on the positive feedback I've received from friends and the many glowing reviews at Amazon.I managed to read about 100 pages before I realised that this book was boring and going nowhere very fast. Maybe I've been spoiled by author's such as George Martin & Dan Simmons who write truly captivating prose.Dune is one of those books that I may get back to one day (with emphasis on the ""may"")."
2,Eeeehhh.....skip this one,"I basically found Dune to be an airball in comparison to the reviews some people gave me. The plot was too intricate, the book was too long, and for God's sake it is a pain to have to flip back to the glossary every page or so. I actually began to uderstand the book at page 425 when the Baron is discussing his plans with Thufir Hawat...but I shouldn't have to read that much for it to get interesting. And I hate to get all of you SF freaks angry...but Frank Herbert was a BAD WRITER. Some of the things he describes are very clunkily worded, sentences either too brief or two wordy. Plus he never used the word ""and"" in the entire book. An example would be a sentence like ""He walked over to the case, opened it."" It just got annoying after awhile. It is a long dull story told with modest talent."
3,Take Your Melange in Small Doses or Not at All,"Dune is a masterpiece to some, but it is pure drivel to others. I began reading it with high hopes. About 10 pages in, I got drowsy and set the book down. I found it extremely hard to pick it up again. In the end I got about 150 pages into it before realizing I should only read ten pages a day (and read another book full time) or just quit it altogether. I have yet to take either initiative (although I have started a different book). I can appreciate Herbert's world building, but the pace is incredibly slow and the writing itself is pretty abysmal. It's just not my cup of tea. Many others seem to enjoy taking their tea with a large dollop of mélange. In my opinion, it's a love-hate affair and I'm one of those indecisive types who are stuck in the middle."
2,have never been able to get into it,"Dune is supposed to be one of the best SF novels of all time. I like SF, so I should read Dune. In fact, I have started to read it at least half a dozen times, but I have never managed to get beyond the first few dozen pages. It just doesn't appeal. There may be some brilliant ideas in there but the writing is so ponderous, it kills any desire to read further."
5,Ain't Dune that good?,"I was introduced to ""The Book"" ( Frank Herbert's Dune)by a close friend. He told me that once you read Dune your life will never be the same. I thought ""Hell! never liked SF"". But in respect for his opinion, i decided to read it anyway. In my way back home one question was disturbing my brain. ""- Ain't Dune That good?"". Well I'll tell you all that i ""devoured"" Dune in about 48 hours. Once you start to read it you can't stop before you finish it. It is so amazing. What kind of mind could develop such a masterpice? Frank Herbert (God bless his soul!!) was a genious. He created the ""Bible of Science Fiction"". Listen to my words as i say ""- Buy it now. You won't be disapointed.""""Ain't Dune that good?"" ""F_ _ K. I'm preety sure of it."""
5,Best Sci-Fi Novel I've Ever Read,I've been enchanted with this novel ever since I read it as a child. A must read.
5,Dune-- The Greatest Sci-Fi Series ever written!,"I picked up Dune, not even being a fan of Sci-Fi literature; yet when I was finished, I rushed to the book store and bought all 5 of it's sequels!Frank Herbert is an equisitly talented writer, from whos style and extensive research came a novel that can only be described as magical.Dune, is the story of a young boy with extraordinary powers, who rises to power, on the desert planet known as Arrakis.Filled with every kind of challange and adventure, from gigantic sand worms, to gripping battles, and even sweet love ""affairs""; Dune is the most exciting series I've ever read.My only regret, is that I don't have a talent with words worthy of this book's greatness."
4,Dune messiah,"Solid read! A little slow at times, but a good 3rd Dune. I'm ready to see what appens next, which accomplishes the author's goal."
4,My first Dune experience,"I put off reading this a long time and finally got caught up to read it. I thought it was a good read, but not as great as some claimed it to be. Maybe the expectation was unrealistic and I would've been better off not having any and be surprised by it. Overall it was entertaining."
2,What was the point of this book again?,"This book was a complete let-down from the first one. The ending was well done, but other than that I cannot find anything at all good about this book. The first half of the book is completely pointless, unlike the first book we don't need to know about the characters because they are basically the same. The only reason I finished this book was to read the next book."
5,Science Fiction masterpiece of the Millenium,"This is by far the most absorbing and entertaining science fiction book I have ever read. It must be read, again and again. If you've seen the film, read the book!!"
5,A Childhood Treasure,"it is written in the apocryphal new testament, within the pages of the Apocalypse of Baruch...""around the sun flies a phoenix, the phoenix excretes a worm and the worm excretes cinamon. this is eaten by the kings and princes of the earth.""thats all ive got to say... this man (Frank Herbert) was certainly well read.love, Snow-Flake. xxx*******ps. since writing this article it has come to my attention that the 'apocalypse' of Baruch has been removed from professor eliotts current edition of the new testament aprocrypha... so if you want to read the words i quote above for yourself you will need to aquire a first edition hard back. very expensive im afraid. tc.*******"
5,addictive,"my favorite story besides to ""kill a mockingbird"". two and three are excellent as well, didnt like fourth book and stoped there"
4,Good but not Great,"Good, but not GreatMost people read Amazon reviews and take their advice. For this book most were 5 stars. This book is a must read for any sci-fi fan but the content is somewhat dry, literally. The center of the book is Arakis, the sole producer of immortality drug, spice. The whole planet is composed of spice and sand. That is where Paul Atrides is betrayed and left to die. Our hero is 15 when he comes upon the desert people who begin to worship him as one of their own. Author Frank Herbert did a fine job on this book, it is filled with information and you can picture it, I think a bit too much. It is waaayyy too descriptive to the point where is seems that the book is never going to end. The action scenes are very short. This book is a must read for any sci-fi fan but it is not for most anyone else."
5,Paul Deconstructed,"I'm not sure why Dune Messiah gets the bad rap apart from Herbert's books... I can only think that the fall of the ""Great Hero"" is a disappointment to some? But then, this is Paul Deconstructed. And if you are a bit annoyed with Paul Atriedes that he became bitter and turned his back on his empire, his people and his children then I'm afraid you've fallen into Frank Herbert's trap... He warned you; Don't worship this guy. Addendum: One of my favorite scenes out of this book is when one of Paul's former Fedykin encounters a true sea (while on Jihad) for the first time. It illustrates the true impact the Fremen deification of Paul has really had on the culture. Heart wrenching."
5,My favorite book ever,"I was never a big sci-fi guy, but Dune blew me away. The story is great-- if you're not into sci-fi don't worry-- this book is a classic revenge story that happens to be set in the future. There are no robots or cliche star trek moments here. Super original, super great, a super book,My favorite ever.If you die without reading this book you are making a colossal mistake."
2,"Nah, I Don't Buy It.","This book was a very long and mostly boring brood-fest in which the protagonist finds himself trapped in an unhappy and inevitable fate. This fate being the jihad to be carried out by his followers. I just don't buy it. Why can't he stop it? I think that Frank Herbert wants us to be so impressed with the over-complex under-explained dialogue that we feel like we are too small to have a valid opinion. The protagonist is just so inhumanly smart, so vastly more intelligent than us, we cannot possibly know of his problems. But then Paul Atreides doesn't exist, there is only Frank Herbert, and he is only human. To me it just smells of BS.The first book (Dune) was good. But like the Earth's Children series, I think it ends there. If you read Dune and want another Frank Herbert, I recommend picking up ""The White Plague"". Not the best book, not even top ten but intriguing and original."
4,Interesting continuation.,"Like dune, it is flawed, spending too much time on internal monologue and exposition better left to the reader. Also like Dune, it is brilliant in many ways--symbolism, philosophy, intrigue, etc. I think one of the reasons that people didn't like it as much as Dune was because they were expecting more of the same and got, instead, a very changed universe (with several contradictions). Sequels in far-future sci fi always lack the wonder of discovering a new world; but in a way, watching the development is just as fascinating. If you liked Dune, read Dune Messiah."
3,"Good, but still second best.","I loved the first Dune book. It was an absolute masterpiece! But this second book was alright. It was a good book, but it didn't really grip you like the first book did. I kept waiting to be stunned by some unforeseen event at the beginning, but it never happened until the middle of the story. Overall, this was a good book that hopefully leads up to a great third book in Children of Dune. I hope that the third book can pick up some of the slack that was left behind."
5,A Masterpiece,"The best way I can describe Dune is that it takes the political and strategical elements of the latest books in the Ender series (Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets) and takes them even further in depth, all the while being supported by an incredible plot. The emphasis put on the importance of every little action affecting the overall outcome helps to paint a beautiful and intricate picture for the reader. The depth of this world is amazing, Herbert creates an entire alien culture better than any I have ever found. He has even made an entire ecosystem with everything having a purpose and explanation. This novel does not disappoint in the least and I recommend it to any sci-fi book reader."
3,Entirely too expensive!,I love this book but i refuse to pay $15 for the Kindle edition when the paperback can be had at a used bookstore for less than a buck. The publisher has made millions off this book over decades. There is no justification for this asking price by the publisher.
1,Formatting makes these ebook unreadable.,I purchased this Kindle book because I wanted to re-read the book but also wanted to have the electronic version. Huge mistake. The book is horribly formatted and is almost impossible to read. One font size results in words being dropped from the end of a page and the next size down results in last passage of a page also appearing on the next page. It appears that there is not a way to get the text to appear correctly. Fifteen pages into the book and I have given up trying to read this great work in the format.
3,Good story - poor EBook,"After seeing the movie I wanted to read the book. I liked the story, sadly the Kindle edition is another poor scan with OCR Error and has obviously not been corrected. Many missing spaces or wrong characters 'j' instead of 'f' etc...5 stars for the story, but only 2 for the scanning."
2,Kindle edition: no quality control,"Note that I am reviewing only the form, not the content of the book. Many word sequences written in italic are mergedlikethis. Do the publishers believe that a Kindle edition require no proofing?"
1,Ridiculous Price,"$15 for a poorly formatted, un-proofread eBook version of a book that is more than 40 years old is a travesty. Love my Kindle, love the book, but stuff like this makes me seriously question the long term chances for eBooks; you can pick up a gently used version of this book for <$1 from various places for crying out loud."
1,Kindle version is awful,"I'll start by saying that I LOVE the book Dune and have for years. The story itself is magnificent and should get five stars. The only reason I'm only giving my review one star is because the Kindle version is so full of typos and formatting errors. I can't believe I paid so much (more than a print book!) for a Kindle version that is so appallingly badly edited.If this were a physical book, it would never have made it to the printer. I can't imagine that this version was even proofread. It's distracting and disruptive, and ruins the flow of the story to be correcting things in my head as I read.Awful. DO NOT buy the Kindle version. Save your money and buy a $2 used paperback copy."
5,"great read, geniously written.","the book may have a high reading level and fairly difficult to understand at times, but if you stick with it I garuntee you will like this book."
3,The Saga continues,"This is a lot shorter then Dune. Parts of it are very enjoyable but they never give you enough time to sink your teeth into to enjoy it. I felt it was written on a much more of a ""Kids level,"" but hey if you like this book then more power to you. Ever great serise has its lack-luster member and this is it for the Dune books."
5,Frightening and Powerful.,"Frank Herbert's masterpiece Dune, is definitely one of The Greats in science fiction. The power and the horror of religious fervor on a dead planet where the minds of the people are terrifyingly fatalistic is captured in surreal and mesmerizing clarity. Where water is so scarce, the people dehydrate their dead for their water, and death is an oh so real component of everyday life, you can feel how the barren landscape imprints itself in the minds of the characters, as messiahnic insanity devours an entire world in its jaws."
5,one of the best books-period!,"If you are a fan of sci-fi, or even if you're not, this is truly one of the greatest books ever. Frank Herbert creates a fantastic world filled with amazing creatures like the sand worms, and unforgetable characters, such as Lady Jessica and Pual Maud'dib Atriedes.In the story there is one main plot, yet there are also sub plots, like Paul becoming the kwisatz haderach--the male Bene Geserit. I can't really put this book into words--you just have to read it for yourself. And if you have trouble understanding this beautiful and complex Dune universe, there is also the handy glossary in the back to help you understand the words. But don't just sit there reading this review--read Dune!"
5,Landmark,"Dune is a timeless book. The writing style is superior to many novels, even after 35 years. I admit that I tried reading Dune and then quit(I was in the 7th grade). But after I saw the movie I wanted to read the book. Was I ever glad that I did! Buy this book. Oh, the sequels. People have mixed feelings about the sequels, so I recommend that you read them at your local library before deciding to buy them. P.S. This book is far better than anything Heinlein ever wrote."
5,I really adore this book,"I'm absolutely satisfied of this book. It contains not only scince-fiction themesbut also problems of all world like the resonibility of leaders, the fanatism, political methods. It also represents what will happen if there's such melange addiction in the world. Ecologycal problems of Dune shows exactly how we can exhaust the resources of our planet. At last the stoy of persons as Lito, Paul, Jesika are told with great tallent."
3,Dune Messiah,"This is probably my least favorite of the Dune Chronicles, but it is a necessary continuation of the story. Still, a very well written sequel that stands up with the first book."
3,Mixed feelings...,"It didn't take me long to finish this book. I loved it from the very beginning and I couldn't put it down but I hate the way it ends: like a stupid fairy tale for kids where good characters are rewarded and bad are punished. And it did remind me of another book, much older than Dune. That is ""Pharaoh"" by Boleslaw Prus. The Prince =Paul, his misstress=Chani, the sons that don't live too long, the priests=Bene G., etc.etc.etc.etc. Therefore only 3 stars and I don't think I'll buy another volume."
3,Good enough,"This book, seemed as though it was very clearly intended to bridge the first and third books. It in and of itself was short, not significantly deep, or very interesting. It may have been important with regard to the overall series, but as a stand alone novel, it was not very interesting. It has forced me to continue on with the series, only to see if there is overall vindication.I would add though, that Dune is one of my favorite books (and yes, I love the movie), so i was predisposed to enjoy the story, it just did not live up to the original."
5,And it'll keep getting better...,"Dune Messiah was a fantastic read. Chronicling Paul's life as messiah on Arrakis, and Paul's inability (read as unwillingness) to accept his own Golden Path. Paul rules Dune and Spice production as only an Atreides could do...This book foreshadows so many of the wonderful happenings in future books, albeit it stands as a novel of it's own merit and splendor.If you liked the first novel, you'll love this short gem in Herbert's universe."
5,A Sci-fi Masterpiece,"I found this book to be extremely intriguing. I had never bought science fiction and had never really cared for it. Frank Herbert did an excellent job of entrancing me into his work. This book is fast paced and keeps the readers attention well. Once started on this awesome adventure, Herbert takes the reader through politics, scandal, betrayal, religion, addiction, love, revenge, and of course the desert. The ending leaves you hanging and forces you to read the next one. This book is well worth the read a couple of times."
3,Complex and well-written with unsympathetic characters,"Frank Herbert weaves an impressively complex tale set during a time of ""stagnation"" in the human race, who are now spread throughout the galaxy and governed under a harsh feudal system. Plot threads include paranoid politics, mystical religions, mind-expanding drugs, prophecies, ancient feuds, and plots within plots all centered on the inhospitable desert planet of Arrakis. Despite all its complexity and imagination, the book is not among my favorites. The paranoid, scheming world the characters live in made them all unsympathetic, merciless pragmatists who wielded (or even created) religion as a tool. I enjoyed it as kind of a dystopia, but felt no connection to any of the characters."
4,Unexpected plot-twists to great book,"Dune is the SF ""everything including the kitchen sink"" classic. It is the rise of the hero. In ""Messiah"" we get the Greek tragic hero's fall.Once again, Herbert dealt with complex themes with far-reaching implications. Will a man detroy himself rather than become something which he is not? Will a hero allow himself to become a focal point for great evil? Great concept.Many who have read this book are disappointed--they wanted another sprawling space melodrama. Instead, we get a morality play. But every time I've read this novel, my opinion of it has gone up. Read it. Think about it. Herbert said he had this book in his head when he wrote Dune. Ask yourself what he's saying. Your opinion of it will improve too."
3,It was okay,"This book lacked the vision of the first story. Paul has grown into emperor and must set things into action for the future. The Bene Gesserit, the Tleilaxu, the Guild, and even some Fremen plot to wrestle control away from Paul. This story is really about politics and Frank Herbert's personal philosophy's on ruling. There is a good story there, but it drags and lacks the sense of discovery that you get from the first installment. It was a worthwhile read, and I do plan to read the third book in the series. I personally think that Herbert may have had the third book in mind first and wrote the second as only a segue to the third book. Happy reading!"
1,Wow.,"Is this book boring or what? I got through the first 100 pages with great difficulty (it was hard to keep from falling asleep) but it didn't get any better. So, I bagged it. I have no idea what the hype was about. I have enjoyed sci-fi and fantasy books before, so that wasn't the problem. It just happens to be a very tedious book."
1,okay,"Hype aside, it's a good, albeit not spectacular story. I was actually a little put off by the grammar and boring parts. I did have to force myself to accept ""spice"" et al. Is it anti-semitic? It could be interpreted as such, but I'm not sure. It's worth a look, but don't buy into the hype. And I hope the don't make another movie. Uhhh..."
1,twaddle-dee-twaddle-dum,"Prose that would make a Dungeons and Dragon novel blush, boring , narcassistic characters, plot goes nowhere...1 star"
1,...sorry...,"After reading Ender's Game...well, to put it lightly, lets just say I got cabin fever.I admit--I have NOT finished the book yet (a side effect of cabin fever), and I WAS intrigued at first. 200 pages in...and nothing remotely exciting was happening. I argue with myself, wondering if I should finish it or not. Will something utterly fascinating grab my attention just 20 pages on? Or will the rest of the l o n g book be a total drab?Dune certainly has a good plot idea, I'm just not sure that Frank Herbert has the gift of grabbing a reader's attention.Please R&R!"
1,The Mountain has birthed a mouse,"Time after time I've seen Dune acclaimed as one of the masterpieces of SF. It consistently tops the charts when readers are asked for the best SF novels. Being a SF reader myself it was almost heretic not to have read it before, so after more than 30 years I decided to give it a try. Awfull, is the word that best describes my experience. I couldn't find any sense of wonder or anything else for that matter that justified such high praises. To compare it to The Lord of the Rings is to commit a crime. This novel is a fraud, a naked king pretending to be wearing the finest clothes. Forget the hype, this is a complete waste of time."
1,"Dune, the book: 5 stars. Dune, the kindle version: 1 star","Dune is an amazing journey, and anyone who has thought of reading definitely should. However, I want to know why the Kindle version is more expensive than any other version?! I'm starting to get REALLY sick of all this. Well, Amazon got their $189 out of the person who bought the Kindle itself for me, but they sure won't get any more money from me for books that are outrageously overpriced."
5,Dune: A Classic that Stands the Test of Time.,"The making of a man and the future of a planet are intertwined in this Science Fiction classic. Paul Atreides is the heir to his Father's Dukedom on th Planet Arrakis. The planet is the key to intergalatic commerece because of its large supply of spice. As Paul completes the rite of passage from child to man a new generation make their mark and it all begins in Dune.Rarely, does a story capture me from the beginning like Herbert does here. The characters leave an indelible mark on the reader and move the story at a brisk pace. This is not an average sci-fi story. It has many levels of religious, political and ecological overtones that still hold significant meaning in today' world. I highly reccomend this brilliant Hugo and Nebula Award winning novel."
5,Nothing compares to it...,Dune is by far the best book I have ever read. I can't recommend it highly enough. I have never found myself so immersed in a fictional world. Words can't describe the beauty of it. Reading Dune is one of the few things I still vividly remember from my childhood...the experience was that intense.
2,A review of the actual quality of this edition,"All opinions aside about the plot or quality of writing of this story, the build quality of this book itself is horrible. The copy I have has strange spacing on many pages, offset sometimes, different sized fonts on other pages. I recommend buying another paperback, not this one."
2,What happened?,"Dune is a colossal work. Dune Messiah is a disappointing work. I don't understand how the same man could have written both books. Dune has strong characterization and a strong plot; Dune Messiah has neither. Dune Messiah substitutes characterization with psycho-babble. Half the dialogue in this book doesn't make any sense and doesn't further the plot. The ending is strong, but it doesn't make up for all the nonsense that Herbert subjected me to. (Don't let anyone try to tell you that this book is ""deeper"" than Dune because of all the confusing things the characters say. ""Deep"" only equals ""confusing"" for people who can't read.) All that said, Dune Messiah made me feel like I was reading Fanfic. It was mildly entertaining, but please don't confuse it with the real thing."
4,One of the true classics of Science Fiction,"It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest feats in science fiction. Frank Herbert created one of the most detailed, most fascinating worlds in the history of SF. He didn't only create of single world, but an entire intergalactic empire, of which the world of Arakis (Dune) is the lynchpin.The characters are well rounded, with even minor characters having believable motives and some with histories that are obviously well thought out and full understood by the author even if he only hints at them within the book.Dune is a massive tome, but it takes that many pages to tell the epic tale that Herbert has set out upon. Definitely not to be missed. The only reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of five were (1) The books that follow are actually better than the first and (2) Herbert's foreshadowing is a little heavy handed...at times he tells us EXACTLY what will dozens of pages before it does."
4,WHAT IS THE PROBLEM!?!,"First off let me say that of course theis wasn't as good as the first Dune nothing ever would be.-But that doesn't mean it's not woth reading. If every book you have to read has to be a masterpice like Dune!-The charector development was good i loved seeing the problems Paul Artrdies actions, and how he is disgued with what he created, It was overal, avery short but good read, and i highly recomend it to anyone who liked the first book."
3,READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"okay, i read this book. i loved it... 2 years later i tried to read it again and i couldn't finish. yes this is a good book. i warn you though. don't read past the third book!!!! it isn't very good.i think you should read it. if you like it, read 2+3. if you don't like it then you don't. what ever it is a book! not the end of the world!!!"
1,There is no way I am paying this much for this Kindle book,"Will not pay $17 for a Kindle of a 46 year old book! This is just a trumped marketing scheme. What really blows is the $8 version is available at the Amazon UK. Seems the publishers have blocked this sensible version from the US Amazon site. Finally to top it all off, numerous typographical errors throughout the eBook. More evidence of a poor attempt to simply pull some more money from saps."
4,A perfect combination of politics and action and death,This book is ok but it has a very slow beging it may take about a month or two to read. I would also recomend the movie after you finish the book. The movie that relates off the story is Dune the one that is 5 hours long so read it!!!!!!!-someone
2,Dune,"Dune seem to have some really cool concepts yet, it was two slow in the beginning so I really never could get into it. the whole benne gesseritt theory was cool where jessica could change the water of life so it couldnt kill you.Thanks for readingSincerelyTyler"
1,An over-rated piece of fiction,"I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: ""it was kinda boring."" If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters."
4,confusing words,This bookwas certainly memorable but it almost lacked in sense. It would have been a lot better if he said normal words than making up his own dictionary. I think the people above are overestimating its quality.
5,A Sci-fi Bible,"I first read Dune when I was 12 and I make sure to re-read it at least once a year. This book, and the five that follow it, will blow you away. Following a very medieval/feudal system of politics, set over 8,000 years in the future, this is a book of intrigue, war, and a messiah, all rolled into one. The two main houses, the Harkonnens and the Atreides, are enemies and when House Atreides is given control of the planet Dune, where the mind-expanding spice is mined, all hell breaks loose. The Harkonnens, backed by the Emperor, seek to destroy House Atreides, little knowing that the Atreides heir is the new Messiah.This book will change your way of thinking in regards to science fiction and once you read Dune, you will want more."
5,A remarkable and intriguing work,"Herbert, in a way that so few else have, has crafted a new world full of life and detail. mMore than just a work of science fistion, Dune articulates several resonating stories of humanity intertwined in a single (though complex) plot. The writting is superb and provides a beautiful portrait of Dune and it's characters. Everyone should at least try to read this book, though I understand it may not be for everyone given it's themes and subject matter."
4,"Amazing book, but.....","Dune is a great book, the problem however is with this edition. There are several obvious spelling errors, and at least twice i've seen whole lines repeated twice in a row. Try a different editon."
5,Well worth the time,"For one reason or another, I put off reading this ""classic"" for years. What can I say? If you haven't read it... read it. It's wonderful storytelling. The tale incorporates recognizable political and religious references without being trapped in specifics of previous or current historical events. A grand tour indeed."
5,Best sci-fi novel ever written. Demands multiple readings.,"This is one of perhaps 8 books that I would give a 10 toand would be my unhesitating answer to the question, ""Whatis the best sci-fi novel of all time?""Herbert has achieved what very very few sci-fi writers do:he has created a complex and utterly believable ""universe""that is almost wholly alien to our own. Yet despite thisyawning gulf, Herbert spells nothing out; we learn about theuniverse by seeing it through the eyes of theextraordinarily compelling characters who inhabit it.This is not an easy read, and it takes more than a singlereading to really appreciate it. NB: do NOT make any assumptions based on the movie. It simplydoesn't compare."
3,Lotsa sand & and guys in stillsuits - what more do you want?,"Presently, I write this review. Presently, Dune is a solid piece of SF, but not without its flaws. Presently, Herbert saw it necessary to use the word presently at least once every other page. I also find the idea of some futuristic fiefdom a little unlikely, and remained unconvinced by the end. Better than Star Wars. Not that that is any great feat. Can anyone direct me to a good stillsuit manufacturer? I am planning on moving to Arizona."
5,test of time,consider how long ago this book was written...and yet it still stands as a sci-fi classic. The movie was a poor attempt to capture the developed characters...Paul...follow his evolving life in the follow-on books..an innocent evolved into a god...just good old fashion reading!!!
5,Alternative Reality,This is The MASTERPIECE of Sci-fi.Its greatness is the ability of F.Herbert to create a real world with a realistic culture in such a way that the reader enters so deeply in this alternative reality that begins to think like a fremen would do and he can't look at the sand on the beach without thinking that it would be better to walk in a non-ritmic way because the worm can hear you.So you enter into a world you'll never forget and the words that the Bene-Gesserit say to fight the fear will never let you alone
1,3/4 of it is missing!,This video description says 4 episodes of Morocco and Russia but it only shows 1 episode of Morocco! 1 episode of Morocco is missing and there is nothing at all on Russia! :(
2,Mature Audience Only,"My daughter (age 9) and I went into the local skate shop and picked up an issue of this mag as recommended by the young clerk. I thought it'd be good to look at since my daughter is showing an interest in the sport and we're thinking about a better board for her.We thumbed through it together and I found that some of the articles were well-written and interesting, but some were really profane - lots of nasty stuff and promoting an unhealthy lifestyle. There were also no female skaters and nothing good to say about women - bummer.So I let her look at the pictures and tore out some of the text - probably 10 pages. There was a pretty cool DVD (an extended ad for element skateboards) that came with it that I think she'll enjoy. But parents should be aware that this is not kid-friendly."
1,Still have not received first issue,My grandson is in prison and has been waiting for the magazine but nothing yet. I don't know who you can find out what happened.
2,static in reception and speaker interference,"I have been a longtime Nokia supporter, and love that they sell simple, easy-to-navigate phones that pick up great reception. However, I returned this phone after one day of use because:- the sound quality was not good: static was present in the background of all of my calls.- when I put the phone near any speaker, the phone caused the speakers to make very disruptive bleeping noises. This included my car stereo and my speakerphone at work."
3,Tiny phone for tiny hands (i.e. men need not apply),"I'm not going to bore you with the many features that this particular phone has since its user's guide is online at Nokia. My complaint is about how small the numbers (4,6,7,9) are. To dial a number one has to actually use both hands since using one hand can lead to mistakenly dial the intended number. I don't have large hands at all and have found this problem to be very cumbersome to overcome with one hand. One user also complained about the screen going blank when recharging. I agree with him. This happens only if the phone is off but the user is left wondering whether the phone is charging or completely charged. I don't know of any phone that blanks out when charging.-AC"
5,Excellent cell phone,"This cell phone is for people who want an updated phone in mobile technology, and of course to talk and call people. The features are great, and this sleek cell phone will fit almost everywhere. Color screen and a voice recorder, you'll find something that you'll like!"
4,Its a basic phone but loud,This is a decent phone ive had it about a year now this is my first phone and i am 16. Its somewhat stylish i guess ive seen a couple people with it is a very good basic call phone and texting. other features include internet which is expensive and kinda worthless. The only thing i can complain about is about 9 onths in i was at my computer doing some school work i placed it near the speaker and a friend called it made a reall loud staticy noise (my speakers were up pretty loud so that could of contributed to it)it was actually starteling and made me jump up and turn off the computer. about a weak later i put it on my tv entering my room layed down and another friend called and it did it again not as loud but still pretty annoying. Anyway its not like the world will end but you might get startled once in awhile.
1,Battery and screen suck,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, because I wanted a simple phone that is light, tri-band, and with a decent battery (up to 2 weeks standby time nowadays is quite reasonable).The battery in standby didn't last more than 3 days, and if you turn off the phone to recharge the battery, the screen becomes totally dark: it is then impossible to know whether the phone is recharging, or whether it became fully charged, which I've never seen with the other Nokia phones!If these characterstics are generic, then get rid of it A.S.A.P.!!!!"
2,it's decent,"I've had this phone since October. I got it because it was so small and adorable. At first I was happy with it...but once I actually started using it, that all changed. Good news first..PROS:-Loud volume-Easy to use-Lots of included ringtones..some are cute, some are a little out there-Voice recorderCONS:-CONSTANTLY drops calls-Recieves text messages HOURS after people send them-VERY small text messages--160 characters...most phones have over 800-The buttons make a very loud clicking noise sometimes so you have to shut off the phone for a few minutes-Bad battery life..if you send a few messages a day and talk on the phone for a few minutes, you're gonna have to charge it all night-You can't have real music tones-Voice recorder can't be your ringtone-Very bad speaker interference..I have to keep it a few feet away from the computer/tv and anything else with speakersI wish more people would have said bad things about this phone before I bought it! Stay away from this phone if possible.."
4,Wow!!,"This is the first book of Leiber's that I have read and I am very impressed. Though the book was written in the 1950's it is able to transend 40 odd years and still be relevent in todays thinking. The most interesting twist is how Leiber moved away from science explaining the supernatural to science using the supernatural to maintain control on an ignorant society of peasents. Another impressive twist to the book was Leiber's ability to move the focus of the novel from between three different, yet important characters, without any interuption. I can not wait to read more of his books."
3,"Yup, he's back","Yes, the man with the lazy flow is back. I'm talkin' about Mase. This single contains his two newest hits, ""Welcome Back"", the laid-back summer-jam that samples the ""Welcome Back Kotter"" theme to joyous effect, and ""Breathe, Stretch, Shake"", the bouncy dance joint. Both are pretty nice songs, except the new ""cleaner"" Mase can't seem to get away from some cliched lines in ""Breathe, Stretch, Shake"", an otherwise nice song. While his comeback didn't make as big of a splash as he would've liked, you can never count out Mase and the ever-changing Bad Boy roster."
1,Absolutely terrible!,"I have read Jane Austen over and over for years, and really enjoyed the ""modern"" movies Sense & Sensibility, Emma, and Pride and Prejudice (with Keira Knightley, although I think they treated it more like a dramatization of a Charlotte Bronte novel than Jane Austen). I was really looking forward to this movie, but when I was finished watching, I felt incredibly disappointed. Tom Lefroy was portrayed as a jerk, who seemed to have no real appreciation of Jane as a person, but just saw her as a woman to conquer. Jane was an idiot and I never could figure out what she was supposed to see in the guy. The sexual innuendos were thoroughly 2007, and stuck out like a sore thumb. I tried the movie again a second time, and couldn't get through it. Next time I'll stick to my previous rule - rent before you buy! A total waste."
2,Ugh... why did I watch this??,"When I first heard about Becoming Jane, I was so excited to see it because I have always loved Jane Austen's stories. Well, I watched it on DVD with a friend, and was thoroughly disappointed!The music is fine, the costumes are fine, the scenery is fine... but the acting! the dialogue was so boring, or too risque'. I didn't see how Jane would even have fallen for Tom Lefroy in the first place. He seemed a complete jerk. I could go on and on, but I won't bore you.I want those 120 minutes of my life back!If you want to see a good film based on Austen's life, watch Miss Austen Regrets (included in the new 2008 ""Sense and Sensibility"" by the BBC.)""Regrets"" has great acting, humor, sexual tension, beautiful music and scenery.Watch it!!"
3,"nice movie, not so nice accent...","i enjoyed the movie, though it was terribly disappointing in the end, but that's the true story so i can't really complain about it. the only thing that i didn't like is Anne Hathaway as Jane. she just didn't fit the character well enough and i didn't find her believable. she also didn't speak convincingly, the accent actually sounded fake (i know it was fake but they should have chosen someone that spoke well enough to be cast as the part) i love Hathaway as an actress, i just don't believe that she was right for this role. the movie is one that i will watch again and i do recommend it if you can get past the speaking."
3,Giving them one more try...,"I purchased ""Becoming Jane"" on DVD from this company in August 2011; it didn't have ANY special features on it as the product review said it would; that's the only reason I ordered it. If this Blu-ray disc doesn't have them either, I'm lodging a complaint."
5,Warm and self sacrificing,Jane and Tom meet fall in love and there are many obstacles to overcome. Different ending bittersweet. Loved it. Will not tell all as it will ruin the movie.
4,tragic love creates author,"I loved this story. Looking at Becoming Jane was enjoyable on so many levels. First I loved theperformances of Anne Hathaway and all the family Austen. I particularly watched James McAvoy...I hadseen him in Atonement, but in this movie he is particularly appealing and watchable. I highly recommendletting go of any prejudices against sentimentality and just look at the landscapes and feelings ofEngland at his time of life. Watching this makes me more appreciative of LOVE and LIFE in the now."
1,Total rubbish,"I understand liberties must be taken when making a nonfiction movie. However, this piece of dreck has as much truth about Austen as ""Shakespeare in Love"" has about the Bard. It doesn't even try to show what Austen's world was really like. To those folks who first met Austen via this film, I strongly encourage you to learn about the real Jane. There are several Web sites about her and her works."
3,Well-done but not enjoyable,"It should first be understood that this movie can hardly be described as ""biographical"" since the so-called inspiration for Mr. Darcy hardly amounted to more than a passing mention in Jane Austen's life. That's fine though- it's not like we're dealing with a George Washington or Napoleon biopic here; I'm sure Jane Austen would have appreciated the conceit. In any case, as a movie I found it well acted and beautifully filmed. As a story, I've hardly ever seen something so depressing. None of the Merrie England atmosphere of the usual Jane Austen adaptation here; the chilling grimness is palpable. Unfulfilled love, impending destitution, mercenary calculations, rapidly aging people, oppressive social mores, general unhappiness, and the knowledge of Jane's early death combine to make this the downer of the year."
5,Jane at her finest,"This movie has blown both my wife and I away. It is every bit as good as Keira Knightley's Pride and Prejudice, Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility and the list could go on. This totally fictional tale of Jane Austen's life is a pure work of art. The language is spot on, the accents are spot on and above all they couldn't have found a better Jane Austen than the performance of Anne Hathaway. You see parts of all of her books incorporated into this story of a brief and emotionally moving part of her life. Bravo!If you like Jane Austen, this is a must see!"
3,It Seemed Like a Good Idea,"We both appreciate Jane Austin's works, and generally appreciate British acting and film production; having said that we tried out this film hoping for a pleasant evening's entertainment.It only took about 30 minutes to decide this movie wasn't communicating with us at all. My wife looked at me and asked if I was enjoying the movie and I told her no and I asked if she was and she responded with a no also.The biggest problem we were both having was we were bored by the movie; a contributing factor was a frequent problem understanding their words.The scenery and cast were outstanding with many familiar faces, some of whom are absolute favorites of ours. But for us it simply did not coalesce into a cohesive whole.My recommendation is definitely to view before buying; if the ingredients works for you after viewing then by all means add it to your collection. As for us I just didn't work and we will probably not watch it again."
4,The one that got away AND becoming a legend.,"Becoming Jane focuses on the life of writer Jane Austen. Anne Hathaway steps fearlessly into the role of the literary icon. Hathaway's performance left a good impression on me, she is a special and diverse actress, loved her accent in th film even though other reviewers did not. James McAvoy is an extraordinary actor as well, this was my first exposure to this enchanting thespian, his charm and wit make him a standout in this regal film. Parts of the movie are a bit slow but I enjoyed the experience, the costumes and language of the film fit perfectly with the time period. Give this unnoticed gem a viewing, enjoy!"
5,A well done Classic,"An interesting take on Jane Austen's life which sheds light on some of the circumstances and characters that served as an inspiration for the creation of her own literary universe.On the technical side, good image quality with a nice film-looking video, great contrast and color balance.Superb audio: -English uncompressed 5.1 @24 bits-English and Latin American Spanish 5.1 Dolby DigitalSeveral subtitle tracks:-English SDH, French, and Latin American SpanishIf you like period Drama this is a flick not to miss."
2,No bonus features,"The movie is great (I rented it from the library). But I found out since purchasing this DVD on Amazon that there is no way to find who has the copy with bonus features. I am hard of hearing and need SUBTITLES. The DVD I purchased was only the movie and nothing else. No subtitles, no director's cut, no interviews.I would love to find a copy with bonus features but I don't know how to do it."
1,Not a Good Investment,"The purchase of this film was a complete waste of my money. The plot was trite, disappointing, stale and sophomoric, and the acting was no better. Otherwise...."
2,Becoming sleepy-a movie to nap by,"This movie did not hold my interest. I would have liked the beginning to be more about Jane's formative years and what led her to the writing. I thought Anne Hathaway was an abysmal choice for the lead. There are so many more talented English actresses who would have been better. It was like seeing all of the Anne Hathaway-isms rolled into this movie. I didn't buy her has beloved Jane, no spark. With a modified script, less of a fantasized romance-more true to real life would have been better. However gave it two stars for the English (really Irish) countryside and James MCavoy (gorgeous eyes!). Julie Walters was fantastic, as usual."
4,Cute,"While this film is certainly not the most thought-provoking movie I've ever seen, it was fun and I quite enjoyed it. I think that McAvoy and Hathaway worked wonderfully together. This movie is a great choice for girl's night in."
2,What would Jane think?,"If you are looking for a feel-good romance film, this isn't a bad choice. The kissing, the loving looks, and secret hand-holding all help to make this a beautiful, predictable love story. But I warn you, if you've seen Pride and Prejudice 2005 (with Knightley and McFaden), then you are basically seeing the same story over again here.First, let me clarify that this IS NOT the true story of Jane Austen. I believe that many people have that misconseption. This is a Hollywood film with Anne Hathaway, so how could it be real? Want to know more about Jane? Read about her life in books and on the web. But don't watch this and believe it is true.There are a few objectionable scenes (rearside nudity, a married couple fondling each other in bed, etc.), and I believe that this film almost earned a PG-13 rating. But in the end, I say PG is fine, and it turned out to be a nice love story. I wouldn't watch it again soon, though"
1,Disturbing,"I'm a true Jane Austen fan....have read every book many times over and watched every BBC production. I was completely put off by the sight of Anne Hathaway's thong underwear showing through her cotton nightgown in the candlelight. Am I only one disturbed by this? For me, this was like reading a huge type-o in a pretty good book. It stopped me dead, I couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie and it's the only thing about the film that stands out in my mind. I'm pretty sure that's what editing is for...but maybe this movie's editors didn't know that it was extremely unlikely that ladies wore thongs in Jane Austen's day."
1,Horribly Disappointing,"First, I will be upfront: I didn't get very far in this movie. There are few movies that I will stop in the middle (in fact, I can't think of any), but this was one of them. I was very disappointed with this movie. It makes fun of Jane Austen. It criticizes everything about Jane Austen's time period. Everything in the movie seemed designed to mock, from the pond filled with scum in front of a great house to an unpolished mirror that could hardly be looked in to show the sisters reflections. It blatantly attacks Christianity ( or being faithful to your spouse before you ever even meet them, by keeping your wedding vows). As strange as it sounds, I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen. It is a movie full of lies. Particularly the lie that by being faithful to your spouse you are missing out. The opposite is true. Hopefully, the movie improved by the end, but I couldn't make it that far to find out."
3,"Lacking one thing......okay, two","This would have been a GREAT movie if they had done what we ALL wanted...if they had ended up together AND it wouldn't have hurt if they had some hot, steamy sex! haha! I mean, gosh, I was just wishing they would with their chemistry's thermostat as high as it was. Man, they were so in love, it sucked that they didn't end up together. I know it was because of her selfless decision....but GEEZE...let the love of your life go because you want his family to have a better way of life? Geeze-BE POSITIVE and BELIEVE you will end up making great $$$ writing (like she ENDED UP DOING!) GEEZE! It sucked...that part did.A good one to watch that DOES have the extras this was lacking...The Notebook!"
3,Becoming Jane,"This was a well acted movie, but has some very unexceptable scenes.The although, brief scene was very very unneccesary and ruined the film for me."
5,Becoming Jane,This was a delightful movie. It showed the ups and downs of young love and ultimately making tough decisions regarding one's future.
2,Disappointing,"I'm surprised this movie is averaging at 4 stars.The actors did their job but something went amiss either in the script or in the editing room. I didn't find the love story convincing at all, and that was the main focus of the movie. This movie was rather haphazard. The scenes that could have been developed and dramatic passed by the opportunity and had no sizzle, while ""filler"" scenes used up precious time. Too bad."
3,"Ok, but a bit dissapointing","I dont know what it was, but something was missing from this film. I cant put my finger on it but as I was sitting in the movie theater watching it, I just kept thinking about it. I like Anne Hathoway as an actress, and thought she did a good enough job portraying Jane, I still think a British actress would have been a much better choice. Anne's accent was distracting at times and it pulled me away from the movie. All the other actors did a fine job and the movie looked pretty enough. But still, somthing is lacking and I think it just doesn't have that spark that certain other period films have. It seems just a bit too modern at times. I would recommend it however to people who like watching period films. It wasn't a bad film, just a lacking one."
5,Great movie for my daughter,Bought this for my daughter. This is a good movie if you like classic books made into movies or movies made about those authors.Also good if you're a girl.
2,"Please, not Anne Hathaway for this role!","I can only say that the good things about this movie are: the score, the setting, and the costumes. Everything else was lackluster.Why was Anne Hathaway cast as Jane Austen? She can't even get the English accent correct! Even I can do a better one than she! She also is the most unconvincing actress available. Her portrayal of Austen is weak and forced. Too bad Keira Knightley couldn't have been cast as Jane, except she already did a brilliant job as Lizzy Bennett.I really have nothing else positive to say about this film. I even have to say that the DVD is of poor quality: hold it up to a light and put your hand in front of it. You can see your hand through the DVD, meaning that it is cheap. My DVD player had trouble reading it.Luckily I didn't buy this, but borrowed it from a friend. I don't think I would've given it away if I had bought it, but thrown it away to spare them the misery created by it."
3,Not bad...,"I saw this at the theaters, and it was okay. I don't personally think Anne Hathaway is very pretty. She's DEFINATELY not my favorite actress. but, I do like James MacAvoy. It was a sweetish movie, but Pride and Prejudice is much better..."
5,Wonderful,"Being a Jane Austen fan, I knew right away that I would love this movie! Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy are two of my favorite actors and they did a great job."
4,Had to View a Second Time,"This film was worth watching a second time, but it wasn't because I fell in love with it on the first viewing. I had a hard time accepting Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen and found myself listening to her acting the accent rather than what she was saying as the character. Ultimately, the second viewing allowed me to relax into the biographical account of a writer whose books (and film adaptations of the books) I've enjoyed so much. I knew little if anything about Jane Austen the woman and it was a good way to wrap up my Austen viewing fest with a story dedicated to her life rather than the lives of her madeup characters. Worth my time and, I think, worth the time of anyone with an interest in Austen's work.Ophelia, September 2008"
4,Becoming Jane Austen,"Nicely done movie and well acted as well! ""Becoming Jane"" shows us a young Jane Austen already dabbling in writing, but hasn't as yet grown into the writer we know her as today. This movie is really about Jane finding out who she really is and wants from life.In ""Becoming Jane"", we learn of Jane's family life and about the social circumstances surrounding life and etiquette during the era in which she grows up. Life is really confining for women back then. It seems that a woman is pushed into marrying a wealthy man regardless if her has feelings of love for him or not.... And being a spinster is definitely frowned upon altogether, let along deciding to create a career for yourself as a writer.We see a side of Jane Austen's personality we may never know about from reading her novels and about the love she gave up for the sake of foraging ahead to become one of the world's greatest women writers."
2,Hollywood Fluff - Not for Anglophiles.,"While it wouldn't be fair to compare this to the A&E Pride and Prejudice, or the BBC's Persuasion, or even Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility as those were stories actually created by Jane Austen whereas this is merely a biography of Jane Austen, perhaps it would then be fair to compare it to Shakespeare in Love, then? In any case, this film fails badly in comparison to any of those. Becoming Jane is painful to observe in many places, especially where they strove, ridiculously, to fit famous phrases from Austen's work into places in the story. This was a thematic idea in the film which I found unendurable."
5,GREAT MOVIE,WHAT A DELIGHT TO WATCH!AND THE PERIOD SETTING AND COLOR AND PRODUCTION WERE WONDERFUL! LOVED IT!
4,Jane was becoming,"Sort of like watching the real life Pride and Prejudice. It is a movie wive's like and husbands can watch. The costumes and country scenes look convincing, and the acting is credible."
4,Wonderful romantic story true to Jane Austen,Love this movie. Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy give great performances. Style stays true to classic Jane Austen. The movie arrived promptly and in new perfect condition.
2,Plain Jane,"This is a fascinating story, about one of the most beloved authors in history. The main problem is that it presents the love story as if it were true, and there's no real confirmation that such was the case. All the research I did after watching the movie (trying to see whether it was based on a real story) shows that the ""relationship"" might have simply been a little flirtation, and not, as it is presented here, true love. Besides, James McAvoy is utterly compelling, but Anne Hathaway has zero appeal, and I found her to be an uninteresting and very plain Jane."
4,"Sweet, sad film","OK. So it isn't historically accurate. OK so Anne Hathaway is American and she's too tall to play Jane Austen. I will be buying this film the minute it comes out because I almost irrationally loved it the two times I saw in in the theatre. The supporting cast is excellent, the Ireland location stunning and the soundtrack lovely. I will, however, be buying this film because James McAvoy makes everyone and everything around him in this movie, better. He is a gifted actor and you can't help but fall in love with him and his character in this film. You know going in that there will not be a happy ending in the ""romantic"" sense...but the journey is sad and sweet. It is just a lovely film."
5,Beautifully done,This is such a good movie and to actually get it on blu ray is even better. Blu ray quality makes even romantic movies look crisp and beautiful.
2,Contrived and so far from what we know about Jane Austen it is impossible to make the leap,"This is no ""Mrs. Brown."" It is a fictitious assumption about Jane Austen and her paramours made into a romantic tale that hardly holds up with plot contrivances galore and the inevitable heartbreak. Watch it once then forget that you did. It is harmless."
4,Great,This is a very exciting movie. When I first saw it I was on the edge of my seat. I unfortunately missed this movie in the cinema. I didn't even get round to seeing it o video until mid 1998. Great performances by Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt. Terrific music score by James Horner and spectacular special effects. You'll love this movie.
1,Do Not Waste Money On The Blu-ray version,I like this movie and my daughter loves it. We were excited about the blu-ray. We have had the DVD version for years. The blu-ray arrived and if you already have the DVD.....please save your money. The image and sound on the blu-ray are no improvement. In fact in many places the image is inferior....far inferior. The DVD has bright colors and has an fun feel to it. The remastered BR is dark and the colors are dead. The image blurs considerably on fast moving scenes. It is the worst BR I have seen since Wedding Singer.
5,Jumanji,This has always been a family favorite! I purchased this movie for my son as a birthday gift and he was thrilled. AWESOME!
4,jumunji,This is a great movie. Funny different unique story would be scary if it happened in real life. Characters help make this movie great.
5,A Wild Ride!,"Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, and Kirsten Dunst star in this phenomenal adaptation of the award-winning childrens book."
4,Fantasy and Magic,"A youg man discovers a game board; but, he does not have any idea of the magical powers of this board.

5,love it,"love the movie and had to own it, delivered quickly, reasonable price, enjoyed ever second watching at my leasure, you will enjoy it too."
