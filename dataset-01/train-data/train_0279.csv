5,A Must Have Book For All Mercedes-Benz Owners,"This book covers a wide range of Mercedes-Benz models, and is a favorite book amung the enthusiasts of the marque.This book offers much in the way of technical information, but does not read as a technical manual. Each chapter is filled with information that you will want to read, even if you do not own that specific model, as it provides an interesting insight on the engineering of the Mercedes-Benz autombile.Members of the Mercedes-Benz Club of America find this a great source of information."
2,Repair book for Mercedes Benz s420,This book was not what one would expect by description. It is complicated and not specific to the S420 as described. This book is geered more for a top mechanic or a automobile builder who would have a vast amount of knowledge about cars. It is not for the average person wanting to know about their car. I got the book and sent it right back with the hour as it was not for me and did not tell me nothing for my S420.
2,Mercedes Benz Technical Companion,this book is good for older model. no tech information about MB 2001 SL 500.
1,Don't waste your money,"I actually belong to the Mercedes Club - who had a lot to do with the contents of this book - and I was very disappointed. I do have an older Mercedes (1969), and I do my own work, and practically nothing in this book was helpful. There are some common problems that are covered, like replacing the rear sub-frame mounts on the swing-axle rear ends, or how to fix the climate control sliders that often break on older models, but this is all info that's available on the internet for free - with better photos! The factory shop manuals are very expensive, but if you're looking for a way to fix a specific problem on your specific model - they're the way to go. One other option is to buy ""Glenn's Mercedes Repair"" also available on Amazon (I did, and I love it) - for an older Mercedes reference, it's the best $13.99 you'll ever spend, and it was better illustrated and photographed than the Haynes manuals to boot."
3,Do not judge a book by its cover.,This book is full of excerpts from magazines published by The Star from various years. Good for general knowledge but this is not the book for you if you are looking for a detailed repair manual for a specific model.
4,Wonderful,"Even though my model wasn't covered very much, the Companion had a lot of pertinent information. I would recommend it for anyone who has an older Mercedes and likes to do their own work."
2,not what i expected,"i bought this book thinking that it would be a good refrence and guide for doing repairs and maintnence on my79 300d. in reading the reveiws on amazon i got that empresion. not exactly. it is collaberation of articles in a mecedes magazine. yes it may have some helpful info, and some tecnical gudance, but it is not necessarly going to have your spacific problem. if you are lookiing for a complete guide to repairs and maintnece this is not your book."
1,"This should be titled ""A history of SouthWest interiors"".","When I purchased the book I thought that it would present a modern overview of southwestern interior design; however, it offered a historical overview complete with hundreds of black and white photos of ancient architect. If your looking for a history lesson without going to the museum, then this is the book for you. Incidentally, I returned it immediatly. It does have a fancy title though."
1,Misleading Title,This book is a historical archive of what are referred to as homes. Mostly black and white photos of Indian dwellings that does not lend to actual interior decorating. This title belongs to the history section in a high school library. I had purchased and returned this work in the same breath.
3,A TOUGH READ,"This is what I would call a 'Dark, dark story of two lives that actually never meet. I would not place it in a ""historical novel"" category as the actual historical value was very meager. The story of Robin, the soldier and Agate, the slave girl are actually two diffirent stories altogether and the book never brings them together as I expected. The reason I call it a 'dark' read is simply that despair,tragedy,and total lack of hope fills the pages from beginning to end. The flow between the two main characters is clumsy at best. Mix all that in with mythical characters in and out of the story and you are left thinking that maybe YOU have fallen into a Wolf Pit.The only reason I give this work even three stars is because of the poetic style of the author, not for its' contents."
3,"No ""Cold Mountain""","This book has 1) lyrical prose, 2) a good rendering of time and place, 3)believeable characters, and 4) obtuse reflections. It does not have a strong narrative thrust. There is no plot as such. Because the last civil war book I read was ""Cold Mountain"" I was expecting something equally engaging. It didn't happen. The poignancy of wolves and green children was elusive."
5,Exceptional book for anyone that is dating!,"This is a book that everyone that is dating, planing to begin dating or will be getting back into dating, needs to read. The authors have a God given gift of writing the truth in a way that is not offensive. This book should be a requirement for any person that you want to date, and of course a requirement for you too!"
5,Ties that Bind,"Pella and Peterson have done it again! Wonderful book. Interesting facts about the building of the railroad. Sweet love story. Helps a lot to read the first 2 books in the series first,but not absolutely necessary.Really shows how a strong faith in God can get one through tragedy,adventure and love. You feel as though you know the characters like family. A must read series!"
4,Pretty good bubble maker!,"So I love blowing bubbles with the kids. I have been looking for a replacement for one that was amazing at blowing huge bubbles that wound up broken last year. This one sort of fits the bill. I can get it to work really well, but my significant other couldn't get it to work for him. Of course my almost two year old wants to try but it is way to big for him.The bubble recipe that comes on the packaging works really well, it is 16 cups water, 2 cups dawn dish soap, and 2 tablespoons Baking POWDER.It is straight forward with instructions on the package, and for 10 bucks worth a shot. Not good for days when there is any wind. But still has a good wow factor when you get the hang of it!"
1,Boy did I want to like this thing...,"I am envious of the other reviews. I worked at this for several hours, let the solution sit overnight as recommended, etc. No deal - probably 3 volleyball sized bubbles in 4 hours? I could do that with a coathanger and standard bubble mix. I gave up, not trying to make a career of this after all, and the kid next door monkeyed with it for a few hours too. I live north of SF by an hour, cant imagine that the climate was significant barrier, but who knows... I may even try it again, not a huge investment. Hope your luck is better than mine."
5,Great item!! :-),We love the Bubble Thing. We have had one for at least 6 years and our boys love when we take it out to play. (The boys are now 20 and 17.) Every 4th of July we have a picnic at my mother's house and the Bubble Thing comes with us. Everyone from the grandparents to the youngest cousin plays with it. The reason we bought a new one is that the old one cracked. We hope to have this until we have grandchildren.
2,No support; Does not work with XP,"I purchased this along with 64 meg memory card. The camera has no support and the patches on the web site are virtually worthless. From what I have found, it seems KB Gear went out of business in late 2001. Yet Amazon, nor anyone else who has thier products for sale care to mention this. After great pains, I finally got the USB bus on my XP machine to recognize the camera, but it would only attempt to download from it once out of perhaps 20 times. It always works from the serial port, but only with high res pictures. Low rez pictures always error out and cause the program to shut down. And high res take about 1 minute per pic (so 30 pics = 30 minutes) from serial port."
1,The company is going out of business,"Try any email support or phone number for reaching this company they will said: disconnected! And I can guest why. JamP3 or JamCam both have drivers that crash the operating system! The software of JamCam is very annoying. The quality of picture is very bad, my cheaper Logitech webcam and Labtec webcam have better quality. You have to wait 8 seconds between pictures, not because of the flash even with picture without flash. Time is money, buy anything else than product from kbgear! The camera can take just 8 pictures because of its low memory..."
1,Buyers Beware!!!,"My daughters were each given a Jam Cam 2.0 last summer. We were unable to get either to operate despite all attempts by ourselves, very computer-savvy friends, and calls to tech support. By the time we gave up it was too late for returns or exchanges. I wrote the company's corporate AND consumer relations offices to explain our predicament. It has now been months without so much as an acknowledgement of our letters. Given KB Gear's utter disregard and lack of meaningful support I feel compelled to discourage purchase of any of their products!!"
3,Pretty Good for the Price...,"The JamCam's photo isn't exceptional but is handy for taking pictures about the house for most purposes. The cameras options are easy to manuever after a few uses. The software that comes was rather pesky, but it's not a huge drawback, it works. I don't what another was talking about that it ate batteries. I've stilll got the originasl battery in it after about 30 pictures. Over all it's a good buy."
1,disappointed user,"I have had this jamcam camera for approx 6 months, having bourght it on price alone. It has cost me nearly 75 to have the software put onto my computer by a proffessional company as I could not get it to accept material by myself. It has only worked on 3 occassions when I have tried to download any photo's. i now wish I had sved my money and bourght a recognised man i.e kodac. I am on windows XP. Yours Sincerely Chris Boswell"
3,A decent digital for the price...,"I'm surprised at some of the problems other buyers seem to be having with this camera. I recently bought one, my first digital, and so far, have had No problems with it. The software loaded up fine the first time and I was able to take and download pictures right from the start. It IS an inexpensive, low-resolution camera so I wasn't expecting 35 mm quality pictures. But for the price, I'm perfectly happy with the results. Eventually I may move on to a more expensive, higher resolution camera, but to start out on, this is a nice, inexpensive way to experiment with digital photography, in my opinion."
2,I don't know what I was thinking...,"Bad software, hard to understand manual and just too difficult for the child I bought it for. We did much better spending more money and getting a ""real"" digital camera!"
2,"If you have no $$ and need a cheap digital cam, get more $$","We owned this camera for a couple years without a problem. It takes pretty marginal pictures but we didn't have money for an expensive digital camera and wanted to take spontaneous (and free) photos of our dogs, friends, etc. Works ok for that but the resolution is poor so you'll immediately be thinking upgrade.But as soon as we upgraded to Win XP, the USB download ceased to work. The Win XP driver just doesn't do USB. The serial cable download works ok but is very slow. BTW, the camera has been finicky about downloading the pictures on stored on the MMC card.Disregard any suggestions that you could use a card reader to read an MMC card with JamCam photos. Doesn't work. Apparently, the JamCam uses a proprietary format that the card readers see as unformatted."
1,I actually give this product zero stars.,"This is NOT a camera for amatures!This camera is so difficult to use you need to be a seasoned professional to use it.The big down side to this camera is only takes a few picture. If you want to be able to take more, you have to use a memory card (which is sold seperately)."
3,pretty good,"This camera is good for outside use. It often comes out bad if you take a picture inside. Also, the place for the memory card is very exposed. If you take it in and out too much, the memory card loses it's contact, and sometimes dosen't work. Also, the downloading program does not work too well on Windows XP, but works good on ME."
3,battery power,"I'm happy with my first digital camera but probably will go upmarket once I get used to it.The Jamcam 3.0 is okay for the price I paid.What is the best type of 9v battery to use with the Jamcam as I've already gone through two batteries in less than a fortnight.Where can I buy a 16MB Multi Media Card for the Jamcam 3.0 and how much do they cost?John, Wellington NZ"
4,Performs as advertised,"If you haven't guessed, this is a toy digital camera. What a great little toy tho!It performs as advertised. It setup fast, software is fairly friendly and the kids can take it without a worry. The images are only good for emailing or lite web publishing. Don't expect to print anything worth framing.I got web pages for my nephews with this camera and they can take pictures and publish them on the web.On the downside, a memory card expansion was a tough find. I ended up buying one from KB Gear because I couldn't be sure what other cards would work. The KB cards are expensive."
1,Be forwarned,"Camera worked great-when it worked, which was for approximately 4 months. I called KBGear to see how I could get it fixed, and was told that they had none in the warehouse, they all go to major retailers. Because they had none, and did not know when some would be produced, they would not fix, replace or otherwise try to compensate for their faulty product. I was told to ""keep trying back"" to see if they get any in, but if they don't I'm just out of luck. Their one year warranty is basically worthless. Just be warned if you get one, it's striclty purchased as-is."
3,Use alkaline battery,The battery issue is easily solved by using an alkaline battery. My camera had problems with battery life but that does not seem to be the case when an alkaline battery is used. A regular battery seems to not be able to recover after 5 or 6 shots. I have gotten 30+ shots from the current battery with no sign of weakening.
2,two and a half stars,"This is my first digital camera. It is a good price and very easy to install and use but the quality of the pictures is average (as should be expected at this price). The fact that the 9volt battery does not come with it is a little annoying. It is very very light so it feels like a toy... I have a small problem with the USB connection but that could be my laptop's fault... The serial port connection works just fine. The fact that it has both is a plus. Finally, remember it only holds 8 pictures..."
1,XP User Beware!! Will Not Work With XP!!,buyers beware the software drivers do not work with Windows XP I could not get it to work and the update on the company website doesn't help. The company is also out of business and will not be able to assist you. Buyer Beware!! Amazon Beware!!
3,Good first digital camera,"I received my JamCam as a Christmas gift - I've used it to take many photos so far. For the price, you cannot get a better camera. As for using it to take print quality photos, I'd look elsewhere. You cannot get ultra clear photos with this camera but you can get fun shots - I use it for my dogs :) Its nice to be able to download the photos right away and see if any turned out.I use a rechargable battery with my JamCam with no problems.All in all, I'd say that my experience with JamCam has been fairly good. I won't buy another and my next digital camera will be higher quality. But for what I use it for, my JamCam has performed well. You cannot expect a $1000 camera quality photo from the JamCam. If you go in with that thought, you'll enjoy your camera :)"
1,junk-junk-junk,does not work with xp no customer support. downloads from website worthless.has anyone contacted the better buisness on this company?
1,Does not Work With XP,CAUTION - I am a computer savvy user and spent MANY hours trying to get the JAM 3.0 to work with XP. I have not had any sucess downloading my kids pictures on XP and the updated drivers posted on JAMCAMs site (dated 2001) do not work.
1,Not worth the trouble,"I bought this camera with the idea that I could get some ""quick & dirty"" shots when I want to email a photo to friends or family. I returned it 2 days later.The camera is easy to use, and uploading the pictures is also easy, but I wouldn't bother. The quality was so bad that it's just not worth the trouble. And I wasn't expecting much...Remember the science/art project in elementary school where you made a camera by sticking a pinhole in a cardboard box? This camera reminded me of that. The only differences being the flash and the digital format.I'm going to wait until the technology improves and the prices go down..."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought my JamCam at K-mart, chiefly due to the low price. Outdoor pictures in sunlight are passable for e-mail, but indoor shots are impossible (no flash on this camera) I've also found that the battery dies FAST, so keep some spares with you. I'm pleased with my purchase, altho I have found the JamCam to be a ""gateway"" camera....I now want a ""real"" digital camera LOL! All in all, the JamCam is a neat little toy to keep around."
4,Great for kids starting out!,It was perfect for my 7 year old - simple to use/download/etc. Cheaper than regular camera and wasted film while learning the basics of photography.
4,Cool Little Camera,I just got this little camera and the pictures that I have taken so far have been good. It seems easy to use and for a starter camera it is great. I look forward to taking more pictures with my little camera.
2,Go for something better.,"The old cliche that you get what you pay for makes another apperance with this digital camera. Although the specs look OK and the pricetag looks excellent, the reality is that unless you're in an office-setting (regarding the lighting and general distance the camera will have to deal with) the camera performs very poorly. It's a great teenager camera (which is obviously the entire point from just looking at the camera packaging itself and the name) because it's cheap and it does the job, but if you're looking for any pictures from your trip to France that you can look at 10 years from now and sigh over with your kids, this is not the camera. Under no circumstances have I found it to be good taking outdoor pictures, no matter the lighting. The camera also reacts poorly to colored lighting (like house lamps).Great birthday present for your 16 year old, but if you want real pictures, I look elsewhere."
2,Disappontment,I have enjoyed the Jesse Stone movies and music. Was hoping this CD would sound the same.If your into jazz this CD is for you well played and wriiten.Lets release again the Jesse Stone Sound track again.
2,Nice but seems dangerous.,"I got these for my 11 month old daughter to play with in the tub. I liked that they had bright colored numbers on them and no holes for water to seep in and mildew. But the tops of the ducks heads are very hard and pointy. If you stepped on one of these or if baby fell down on one, I'm positive the sharp points would break the skin. I had to be careful with her in the tub while she played with them because she likes to forcefully wave her toys around and if she were to hit herself in the head with one...OUCH! The ducks really did surprise me with this. I wish I had not bought them at all. I'm not going to let her play with them anymore. I'll get her some that don't have pointy, hard edges on them."
1,Buyer Beware Content,"This book was authored by a cult leader in the 70s who thought she was pioneering a new form of therapy to treat schizophrenic patients. The content of the book can be graphic, disturbing, and readers beware, these techniques are more harmful than helpful. Reparenting is practiced by some therapists today, but in different forms. If I had the option of 0 stars, that would be my rating."
5,Marianne proves her talent,"When this album came out in '87, a critic called it ""music to slit your wrists by."" Marianne took it as a compliment. The CD is definitely a downer to those unfamiliar with Marianne. With this, she explores old blues and torch standards, and also does a new version of ""As Tears Go By,"" her first hit back in '64, updating to suit her much-changed voice, and sinking her teeth into the intense world-weary feel of the lyrics. She also does a version of ""Yesterdays,"" first done by Lady Day herself, Billie Holiday. A real highlight, that one. Even Sinatra couldn't do that one justice. While I wouldn't recommend it as an intro to Marianne's music, it is definitely a treasure and proves that Marianne Faithfull is an artist worth her weight in gold (even though she doesn't have many gold records to back that up)."
2,Bloated,"This is a 2-disc set bloated to 5 discs by redundant playing of the same scenes for different narratives. Audio quality variable with the narrations often overcome by the music. Editing poor as infrequent use of maps and credits given at the end of first half of disc and again at end of disc. Iwo Jima only occupies one half of disc 5 and naval battles are glided over, so misleading title. In all, kind of boring to watch.Disc 1: Pearl HarborDisc 2: New Guinea/Guadalcanal & the SolomonsDisc 3: Tarawa/KwajaleinDisc 4: Saipan & Tinian/PeleliuDisc 5: Iwo Jima/Okinawa"
1,"With the sound off, it's a tad better","I'm not sure how the soundtrack made it past QC, but half the time you can't hear the amateur-quality narration for the sound effects and music in the background. Video clips replayed several times don't add anything to the experience, and in the end it's time you'll never have back again. Get something from Time Life instead, which actually previews its discs before selling them. Spending money on something this bad is affrontery towards yourself. Iwo Jima's hardly in here anyway."
1,Bland with SEEDS and peels!,"I was VERY disappointed when I received these pears. They are not peeled and the seeds are not removed. The peels alone I could probably forgive, but many pieces have seeds and/or core, which make for difficult eating, especially for children. Even the taste is rather bland. They are not sweet pears at all, and are leathery texture. Definitely not a child-friendly snack! Now I'm stuck with fifty bucks worth of seeded dried pears, because you can't return food. Definitely would NOT recommend!"
1,Texture like beef jerky,I was so distracted by the horribly chewy texture I don't remember much about the taste. The Granny Smith apples are crunchy and tasty. Neither of my kids or I enjoyed the pears.
5,Gem for all to behold!,"Black Diamond is indeed a precious gem! Joan Wolf's caliber of writing is reminiscent of classic Mary Higgins Clark. Wolf transports the reader into her suspenseful novel by masterfully developing her characters so that the reader is not reading about them, but is interacting with each of them. Without a doubt, this is a page-turner, impossible to set down!"
1,NOT WHAT WAS PICTURED,"RECEIVED KIT THAT CAN BE PURCHASED FOR HALF OF WHAT I PAID. NO FERRULS ON BRAZINGTIPS,BLOW MOLD KIT BOX SUBSTANDARD."
5,good book for children,"I like the content and intent of this book. With this book and other similar to it, I treat it as any other book I might give him to read. That seems to make it more acceptable to him than if I single it out and make a big deal over it. It speaks well to my 8 yr. old and certainly is information I like for him to have."
4,Great topical book,"All these books published by Elf are helpful to raising kids who are more secure, hopeful, and empowered. Any kid with there parents to would benifit by having this book and talking about it together. Good getting to know you kid for parents."
4,This is good for little ones!,"My daughter did enjoy reading book. I just wish it was a story, and not little different stories. The delivery was fast. Thank you"
2,Not for me.,For my taste these are way to hard. If your a Pro with finger tips made of steel these may be very good for you cuz they do produce a very nice sound. But if your a newbie like me or only pick up a guitar every now and then these are very difficult to play with.I wish I knew what were the strings that came originally came with my guitar cuz those were much easier to play with.
4,Very nice set of premium strings,"These stings are very good. Personally I prefer the d'ddario phosphor bronze, but the polywebs last 3 times as long.Another upside to the polywebs is that they eliminate string noise, and ""string grab"" on your fingers when sliding up by fiths, octaves, or when just changing chords quickly. The fingers kind of glide over the stings.Downside is that the coating does noticeably effect the richness of the tone when the strings start to age, and will never sound exactly like a top quality un-coated new phosphor bronze set.Then again my ears are very very particular to tone quality and timbre, and some say they don't notice any difference."
1,How not to ship,The only item that I have EVER ordered through Amazon that was not double boxed. They just put postage on the flimsy box and mailed. The unit arrived in 100+ parts. I urge anyone not to order from this shipper. They wanted me to ship the pieces back to them at my cost. Not worth my time!!
3,Ancient medical arts,"A romance novel although the love affair is a woman's drive to fulfill her destiny as a healer. This story takes place during a time during ancient Roman days when someone who is gifted in the medical arts is revered. The prime character seeks new medical knowledge and finds it in her many journeys, at the same time trying to solve the mystery of her heritage.Wood has researched the ancient healing arts and the vast use of herbal remedies, She makes us ask, ""has medicine really come very far?"" The way the author integrates the myths and legends brings excitement as well as authenticity to the story. Very believable."
3,Eh.,"I'm only a little impressed with this book. After having read The Dreaming, I had high expectations from Barbarba Wood and felt slightly let down after reading Soul Flame. It was entertaining at best in some parts and seemed to drag in others."
4,Nice book... nice reading,"As almost all of her books, Barbara takes you to the past and makes you to live there, this is a good book but it has some things that I think are not true, for example it says that Cleopatra was white as milk and in every book of Cleopatra that I have read says that Cleopatra was almost brown, and some other things that in some books are different.The 2 love stories of Selene are different and I don't know if it could be as easy to forget as Andreas did, but is a book and you read to have fun.You will be inside the story all the time and you will love Selene for what she does for the people."
4,Athens Doormat Review,"Door mat looks good and sturdy. Seems easy to maintain. Does not lay flat against my tile portch, if that is a draw back."
5,GREAT SIZE + GREAT VALUE !!!!!!!,"I am cheap + picky about quality. I shopped all over for a doormat and finally found this and we LOVE it! It is twice the size of our old (standard size) one, and it is pretty good quality. It will definately hold up for a while. The big box stores are asking comparable $30 for this, and since we bought enough to get free shipping, this cost us only $9.99, and was well worth it! I HIGHLY recommend this product!"
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I DIDN'T RECEIVE THE MAT YET. BUT I ALREADY ORDERED IT, I AM DISAPPOINTED TO SEE, OTHERS GOT THE SAME ITEM FOR 12.OO DOLLARS. AND 9.99. BUT I AM PAYING DOUBLE THE PRICE."
4,Fun read with a pace that picks up at the end,"When I started this book, I thought it was going too slow, and it was a bit predictable. Then toward the middle the plot got more convoluted which is the way I like it. Archer is a fairly good writer, and obviously has enough experience within this diplomatic community to know or be able to get information on what is going on. It was a surprise to me to find out Archer is British, and writing about American groups. Occasionally I wonder if these groups such as the CIA, FBI, and England's own similar groups are as morally ambiguous as Archer and people like Tom Clancy indicate they are. If so, maybe the media and public ought to get more involved in policing these groups. However, this was an enjoyable and quick read. I plan to read more of his work in the future. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh"
4,Read it!,"One of many other books I've read for J.A. I like his style of writing, just perfect!A good book for a fast read! Sensible, and interesting!"
1,What's going on?,"I am very disappointed with the effect put in by Jeffrey Archer. This book is full of loopholes and is ""unbelievable"". And just like many other readers had already pointed out, the characters are one-dimensional. And let me point out some more plots that are unrealistic. 1. The reason that the bullet missed the Russian leader at the football game. 2. The 180 degree change in character on the Deputy director of CIA in the Oval Office toward the end. How could a person at his level chickens out so easily? The least a layman will do is to consult a lawyer before agreeing to anything. 3. That the director of CIA is still around after the President had the perfect opportunity to hang her, after the President had the opportunity to hang her. ...And many more that you will discover."
2,A long sigh....,"This book made me think about those who were forced into early retirement plan of a downsizing corporate. An easy and quite predictable read. I wish Mr. Archer would force himself into retirement to keep his goodness in our memory instead of cash-in by his deteriorating story-telling ability. I will not read anything from Archer from now on. Thanks anyway, Mr. Archer, for the many good moments that you've contributed to my life. Bye."
2,Pathetic,"I had not read one of Archer's books in some time. When I finished this book, I was so disappointed in this effort. This book is poorly written and I had to reread certain pages to understand which character was doing what. I hope his next effort is better."
2,Shallow and disappointing not a classic Archer novel,"For an Archer novel this one is a disappointment. It starts out with an untenable premise. That is, the president of the United States can't fire a CIA director on his own accord. Then goes on to the usual plot line of an out of control goverment agency & it's director. He even takes the obligatory slap at the republicans and even that doesn't help the story. I found this book to be rather shallow and boring. Very unusual for an Archer book. I have enjoyed all of his other books. This one appears to be hurriedly written so Mr Archer can make some money with his name. There were points when I even questioned whether he did all the writing."
1,Painful to read after first 50 pages,"A poorly researched story involving unrealistic charcters and an implausible plot. A CIA assassin for 28 years, Connors suddenly gets demoted to the Cleveland office without objection? Utterly ridiculous. A CIA director with more power than the president secretly orchestrating world events? Preposterous. Each character jumps from event to event without the smallest inkling of how any of this could possibly happen. If you have any knowledge of how the US government and its intelligence agencies work read at your own peril. For those whose current comic book selection is too tame, you may find this edible. Did JA really write this?"
3,interesting,Not Archer's best but I enjoy reading his books. This book was entertaining and less dated than the others.
4,Vintage Archer...edge of your seat suspense,"Archer has done it again with a suspenseful ""spy"" book that one cannot put down. Easy to read, gripping...one is vaulted into the well-defined settings and quickly connects with the characters. Only 4 stars as it was predictable in some areas...otherwise a great one!"
3,"GOOD & FAST PACED, AN ENJOYABLE READ!!!!","REMINDS ME OF A MATTER OF HONOR. WELL WRITTEN, flows great and interesting. A little far fetched, but enjoyable."
4,The perfect companion on a rainy afternoon.,"As with all of his works, Archer makes no attempt to do anything except entertain the reader. His in-accuracy's in referring to the Remington 700 rifle, as a break-action (it's really a bolt-action), his choice of a hollow point round, notoriously inaccurate , and being able to identify a boattail slug from seeing the full round, can all be forgiven as long as he keeps writing great fiction."
4,Archer is Incredible Truely Understands What Readers Want!,"Right from the first paragraph he had me. I would have given it 5 stars but was a little disappointed in the ending, justice didn`t completely prevail.A MUST READ! I can`t wait for his next one."
2,"A terrible book, but if you like the obvious......",I must admit that the pace of the action goes on and on. But that's about it! It's very hard to feel any sympathy for the main character and this makes it hard to enjoy the story. It's like a bad movie. Lot's of action but there's no point to it!
1,have to give one star as nothing lower was avialiable,"The story is full of so many loopholes that one wonders whether Lord Archer was not trying to get some free publicity before the London mayorship polls. The plot is hackneyed, there is no originality. Some of the loopholes has been mentioned in other reviews, but there are many more glaring ones. For Archer fans( a category to which I also belong) I would advise better not to read the novel, and remember his thriller writing skills based on ""Shall we tell the President"" and "" A matter of honour""."
2,A quick read but ultimately unsatisfying.,"How much you enjoy this book will depend on how much of a stickler you are for realistic plot resolutions. Many of the ways the author comes up with the plot twists are absolutely absurd. Case in point: the President's Chief of Staff must have had some incredible mind-reading training, because he sure as hell wasn't reaching conclusions grounded in any form of logical deduction or analysis with which I am familiar. Still, the pace is pretty quick and the characters are interesting enough to hold your attention for the long plane ride it will take to read the entire book. This is no ""cracking good read"" but it is better than being stuck in a center seat watching ""Waterboy,"" that's for sure..."
4,Another Good One,Archer is an amazing story-teller and has given another good one. Although not as good as some of his others still a good read.
3,Good Vacation Time-Killer,"Like most authors of this genre, Archer starts out at a high intensity but with fairly plausible characters and plot lines for the first hundred pages, but to maintain the ever-increasing tension, the characters and the plot have to move off into never-never land. By the time you get to the last fifty pages, he's off the charts. But long before that, you're hooked on the adreneline rush and you stick with it until the end. Not a great book, but a pleasant way to kill a rainy weekend at the beach or wait out a blizzard on the ski slopes. I wouldn't buy it, but I'll read a few more of Archer's books from the library to see if they are better or worse than this one."
4,My first Archer novel...,"Although I have read J. Archer's short stories, The Eleventh Commandment is my first novel. Hence, I do not have any basis of comparison vs. his past novels, which most readers say are a lot better. Regardless of that observation, I have found this book very enjoyable. The opening scene has caught my attention & the subsequent events are definite page-turners. I agree that the story takes you for a (roller coaster) ride from one country to another & the events may be quite surreal. But what is specifically there which is not believable? For someone who has not worked with the secret service, much more with the NCOs, Connor's every movement is livid & brings us closer to feeling his dilemma. My only negative comment though is on how Mr. Archer portrayed Connor's character...a seemingly flawless person. But overlooking this shortcoming, The Eleventh Commandment is a very enjoyable read."
4,KNOW BEFORE YOU SPEAK,"I like this authors work very much; his short stories remind me of Maugham, but he seems unable to write anything about firearmsthat is correct. He is desparately in need of an editor knowledgeable in this field because the lack of versimilitude en-gendered by these glaring errors are a shock to the readers sensibilities.P.S. I could be this editor"
3,The Twelfth Commandment is to read it!!,First book I read of Jeffrey Archers'. From that point I went on to read 5 others. Archer shows diversity as an author as this novel is a spy thriller like A Matter of Honour. Very good story.
5,What a Great book! I finished it in one sitting!!!!,I found this book as exciting as The Day of the Jackal. It was a surprise ending but not difficult to figure out. This is one of Archer's best.
2,Tom Clancy Wannabe falls WAYYY short of the Mark,"HAving been a fan of Jeffrey Archer for many years, I was looking forward to once again enjoying a book with rich characters and insider realism. Unfortunately this had neither. With the exception of a grand sacrafice made for the main character by his best friend.Gone from this novel was anything that showed that the author honestly had a clue about the world he was writing about. From the unbelievable two dimensional director of the CIA to the sheer ignorance and gullibility of the hero's family this book leaves the reader wishing for more meat and less sizzle.If you a GOOD spy story, check out Clancy's latest Rainbow Six.If you want a children's spy story then perhaps this will suffice."
3,Doesn't Tax Your Brain,"After spending the summer reading books that put you on a roller coaster ride, it was refreshing to read one that felt like being on a carousel. Although not as good as his previous work, I did enjoy it. I have read all of his books, this one being the least character driven. Unfortunately, Archer is at his best when his characters are fully developed."
2,The Doomsday Conspiracy of J Archer---disappointing,"This novel was almost an insult for the Archer fans. I did not see any good plot nor articulate coincidences, which the author usually loves. No character development, which is unusual for the author, no witty conversations. I doubt he actually wrote it. I recommend ALL of his previous books up the the Fourth Estate. They have all of the above."
1,No Beginning to his Talent,"It always amazes me how anyone can enjoy such leaden, clumsy prose. If there was ever a case for dumbing down, it has to be Jeffrey's output and the end users. Sad. Irretrievably sad"
2,Not the best book of Jeffrey Archer,"I was a little surprised with this book , I expected a lot more from Archer , but this book is full of non believable characters like Helen Dexter and some others.It tells the story of a secret CIA agent who does a lot of non ofcial work , he was about to retire when a last job was asked to him , kill Zerimski , a russian presidential candidate but he didn't knew this was a trap for him to get caught and for the CIA to get hands clean on the murder of a colombian presidential candidate.This book is fast and easy reading but most of it is non believable , it's like a movie , short and with a lot of plot holes.I recommend this book only for Archer fans , I like his work in general , but I didn't like this one that much , it's not that bad but like I said , most of it is non believable.If you want to read a short an easy reading book maybe you'll like it , but in my case I didn't."
2,eleventh commandment not up to par with today's thrillers,"Jeffry Archer's book ""The Eleventh Commandment"" was written ten years too late. The plot of the novel is tired and has been done before and since the collapse of communism in Russsia, a lot. The plot has to do with our hero being set up by his boss to kill the Russian President so the CIA won't have to face anymore budget cuts. Also, they want our hero out of the way so he can't squeal to the president about covert operations. If you have not read Jeffry Archer before, do not start with this novel. Almost anything else he has written is better."
2,Havent read yet,"I have not yet read this book, but find that paying 11 dollars for a book 200 pages long deplorable, especially when the print version is going for less than half that. Where is the justification. Both publishers and authors are taking liberties in the new digital age, because consumers no longer physically hold books in their hands they seldom see when they are getting ripped off."
2,watch the weather channel,"The Eleventh Commandment belongs in Archer's head, not on paperback. It's poorly written with a washy protagonist, and an incredible villian. The plot is threadbare.For first time readers of Archer: Please don't judge him on this appalling work, he is better than this."
5,Excellent Read....Couldn't put it down.,"Archer does it again with the Eleventh Commandment. This book is a page turner for anyone who likes suspense novels. The charactors are interesting, the settings varied and appropriate. I LOVED it!!"
2,Definitely Not Archer,"After reading all of Archer's other books, expectations were set high. But this book disappoints. The pace does not pick up, the ending is rather lame (and quite predicable), and the various settings not grand enough."
3,"Not as good JA's others, but 3 *s for JA beats almost anyone","This latest offering is a disappointment when compared to Archer's other books, but still a quick and interesting read. Surprisingly, and disappointingly, given that the author is Jeffrey Archer, the twists and turns of the plot are predictable. Also, being from the Washington DC area, where some of the action of the book takes place, I wished Archer had done a better job with his research. This book screams WAIT TO YOU SEE THE MOVIE! Maybe Archer is falling into the regrettable habit of many of the more popular writers of writing a book to a movie?"
2,I did not enjoy reading it at all.....,"Its Funny to think a person such as Jerrery Archer who has written books as Kane and Abel {which is almost a legend} to write a very mediocre book such as The 11th commandment ... The book starts off well but then it starts to the stuck in the same place for long moments and this is very frustrating and boring ...in short after i finished this book i felt very dissatisfied at the story and the very predictable ending that this book has...ahhh thats one more point the book is extremly predictable all the way .... I will not recommend this book .... look for another book from JA or many other good fiction authors ,i am not going to write a list here."
4,A quick read on a par with Archer's other books,"I found this to be a quick and enjoyable read. While not up there as my favorite Archer book (Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less), it had all the elements to keep me interested. With the fall of the Soviet Union, I worry that there might not be enough bad guys for today's fiction, but fear not, we learn of the Soviet mafia and one CIA agents loyalty to his president."
4,Next best thing to being there yourself,"I have had the pleasure of reading 12 Red Hearrings and this was even better. There was enought turns to keep even the best CIA readers behind the wheel. I did have one big fear through the book, could this be how it really is in the real world? If so I would rather have my President chase skirts. Great book"
2,not to the high standards of his previous novels,"the latest from Archer is not his best nor does it show his interest.the thrill of Kane and Abel,the determination of Prodigal daughter,the well researching of The fist among equals are all missing.Archer should not have written in haste. The book could have taken an interesting turn if Connor had successfully assasinated in his first attempt and we would have seen a nuclear stanoff."
3,I expected more of Archer,"Having read virtually every Archer book, The 11th Commandment fell short of all expectations. Its a far cry from Kane & Abel (my all time fav. Archer book). A simple plot and preditable ending. I do hope the next book will get better."
5,The Eleventh Commandment,This was my first Jeffrey Archer novel. I will certainly read others. This was fast paced with several unexpected twists.
3,"Very good story, but disappointing end.","It was a very good story that kept my attention right up to the end. Unfortunately, the ending was a big disappointment. The bad guys didn't get the punishment they deserved and justice was not served. Not what I expected at all."
3,We filled the empty landscape with Archer's words.,"This book on tape was our companion driving through the deserts of the southwest. The book shared some similarities with the desert, every now and then there was a peak, then long, flat, dry stretches. Actually the story was not bad,it just got a little absurd in spots. The main characters and the premise was interesting and I found myself rewriting it for the screen and casting the movie, so I guess it couldn't have been too absurd. It was a good summer read - a great time killer on a southwestern trek."
3,He's not Le Carre.,"This book has its high points, but in general it is much too obvious. Mr. Archer builds characters and dialogue fairly well but lost me with the confusion of his plot lines and obviousness; and the ending was just too silly to believe. However, this is a vast improvement from his prior book, 'Kane and Able' which I would give only a single * to.vGe"
4,"Eleventh Commandment, my rating","Jeffrey Archer has the ability to incorporate politics into his writing, and not make it boring. Not only isn't it boring, he creates intrigue, excitement, mystery, suspense and double-crossing all in one story. A very good read for the person who enjoys conspiracy theories with a political view, with a good dose of double- crossing."
3,"Good and fast paced, an enjoyable read","REMINDS ME OF A MATTER OF HONOR. WELL WRITTEN, flows great and interesting. A little far fetched, but enjoyable."
5,egg mold,this mold is huge...not medium sized. I am using this item for ceramic art making and not for candy making.
2,TOO SMALL,"I have Mad About The Sixties and Mad About The Seventies. Both of these publications are 8-1/4"" x 10-1/2"" (87 square inches), or about the same size as the original magazines. For some totally inexplicable reason, the aptly self-named ""Idiots"" at Mad decided to downsize Mad About The Fifties to 6-1/4"" x 7-3/4"" (48 square inches), a little over half the size of the original magazine. The print is much smaller, as are the drawings. In reducing the size of the drawings, much of the original detail is lost. This is particularly noticeable with artists such as Jack Davis, where exquisite detail is one of the hallmarks of his craft. The ""Idiots"" dropped the ball on this one."
3,"Small, again.",I don't rank this book higher because of the size. I don't know why the publishers made it again. I have from Mad about the sixties to Mad about the eighties and the size of the books is just perfect. They reduce the size in Mad about the nineties and made again with this one. Sometimes it's hard to read but anyway not a bad compilation.
5,A great MAD Book,"This is a great and very funny book. It collects comics and features from various MAD Magazines during 1952-1959. It is a great deal, and is the perfect size for reading during class."
2,Formatting is choppy and difficult on the kindle.,Does not translate well to the kindle. It might be worth buying if it was sold at a price of about 99 cents.
2,a pleasant enough look at 18th ordinary life,"Eleven-year-old Anna Green Winslow, from the prominent Winslow family of Massachusetts, was dispatched from Nova Scotia to Boston to be ""finished"" in 1771. Soon after her arrival and through the spring of 1773, Anna kept a diary of her daily life, advances in sewing and writing and dancing, and social engagements. It's not scintillating, but it is a nice look at the everyday life of a young girl at the birth of the American Revolution. You will learn a lot about the lives of the 18th century well-bred women. Parts of it are unintentionally funny as the Puritan Anna, despite the religious imprecations to modesty, is just as fashion-conscious as any modern teenager.At barely more than 100 pages, Diary of Anna Green Winslow, A Boston School Girl of 1771 is definitely worth a read."
3,"Nice book for begenner, but lacks in breeding information","Good information, excellent photos, easy to read. I was expecting a upto date discussion about breeding and information on feeding (other than gold fish). I was disappointed"
1,Apsolute Waste of Money,What a waste of money. You'd better of reading an article or an expert advise on the Internet than reading the entire book. Which adds to my frustration is the extra cost I encountered on shipping the book internationally.It has absolutely neither a meaningful new peace of information nor a serious know how.
5,Great suspenders.,When these suspenders arrived I was pleasantly surprised. From looking at the picture I had assumed that the suspenders were not very wide but they were the perfect width. The suspenders are worth the money.
4,Campy and Fun,"The print/design is fabulous. I thought these were campy and fun... I am not an electrician, but as an artist and snappy dresser, I thought- why not? After all, I love suspenders.But since I am a medium-build woman standing a scant 5'4"" they look a bit wide on me. Oh well. Hence the 4 stars.The silly and colorful design makes up for the odd scale. In their defense, the clips are mega-strong, and they are sewn well.I would recommend them to most."
5,The best!,"This is a wonderful CD. You can really feel the emotions of living in paradise and then having to return to reality. Jerry Jeff is as creative as ever and still has that touch. It really made us long to go to Belize, and we did, with Jerry Jeff along all the way!"
4,just what I was looking for,Not my favorite CD of all time but this one stays in my changer. Every song is interesting and has its own allure. I don't use the skip button on this CD.Good Stuff.
2,"Just OK, I'd pass on this one","This is an OK CD. Not one of his better efforts. The best song on this CD, Boats To Build was of course not written by Jerry Jeff but by Guy Clark. It is very dissapointing to see Jerry Jeff's lack of original songwriting in recent years. His best stuff has always been songs not written by him but atleast he used to write a decent song once in awhile"
5,Does Get Much Better,"I recently bought this for $5.00 used. I am afraid I feel like I stole something from the shop steward. This disc is amazing from start to finish. A mix of blues, stunning solos, jazzy tunes. It's crisp, clean and Ronnie Earl at his very best. No one who has reviewed this has come away with anything but glowing kudos; 12 sensational offerings, one better than the next. How could this end up for $5.00? It's worth four times that much."
1,Red Horsemen is a dull event,"I love reading, but this book actually made me dislike it enough that I started looking for reasons not to read. Hopefully it is just this book."
4,"In a word, ""WOW!""","Jack Yocke wants to make his name big in the Washington Post as a top reporter. He found himself in Russia near a nuclear meltdown. Over a million dead to simply hide the fact of twenty thousand tactical nuclear weapons were missing.Rear Admiral Jake Grafton, Deputy Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is dispatched to Moscow. He and his team are to ensure that all the weapons are destroyed before they disappear into a Middle East terrorist pipeline. Grafton soon finds that some American officials want him to fail.British billionaire Nigel Keren was murdered. His body was found floating in the sea near his yacht. Contacts in Israeli intelligence have proof he was actually the victim of a hit squad from WITHIN the CIA. Grafton soon knows way too much and has been targeted for assassination."
4,Not his best - but better than most.,"I'm a fan of Stephen Coonts, and look forward to every new release.I snatched this up the moment I saw it in my bookshop, and it took me all of a day to read it.Like all Mr Coonts' books, this is great fun. The Admiral allows himself to go completely O.T.T. at times, Toad rushes around, being horny and dreadfully in love, the bad guys are as cold and calculating as anything you're ever likely to read.. and hey, it's a good read.Don't try to find too much in it - simply enjoy it. It's a very good addition to Jake Grafton's history, and everything works pretty well.No, it's not Mr. Coonts' best. But then - his worst is a darn' sight better than the best of most of the writers who work in this genre."
4,More thinking than action adventure. Still a good book.,I thought parts of the book dragged. The whole story was more spy adventure than action adventure. Not that that is bad. It was just not as exciting as the previous books in the series.
5,Stephen Coonts is an excellant author.,He knows how to tell a gripping story that can keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat from start to finish. I rate this book 5 star and an A+.
5,Makes daughters meal time fun,"My daughter (4yrs old) loves these, we take them everywhere. They are perfectly sized for small hands. Easy to clean, dishwasher proof. Stainless steel seems good quality as no rust after being through the dishwasher multiple times."
3,Simple and Understated,This frame is a perfect choice for when you want the picture to be the center of attention and not the frame. The low price on this frame makes it a great addition to a gift basket for family or friends...don't forget to place in a special photo before wrapping this holiday gift.
4,i love this,I love this and other Grace Jones songs when she sings with force and demands respect for herself and her natural singing ability. My favorite song is Nipple to the Bottle. I love her strong voice over the almost reggae style beats.
4,interesting.,I chose 4 stars because it was a good book . I'm not in love with it for 5. All the spoiled and riches we have now and what people thought was amazing back in the day cannot compare. I'm so grateful for all my clothes and shoes especially stretchy pants!
2,"Manners, Customs and Dress during the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance","The text for the book is fine, but although the author constructs his book around art depicting the customs and dress of earlier times, not one of the many illustrations is included in the digitized version I received from amazon.com. This essentially negates the book's purpose for existing."
1,This version has no pictures,"Do not bother with this version. The pictures are missing. Get this one instead:Manners, Customs, and Dress During the Middle Ages, and During the Renaissance Period (Mobi Classics)"
3,Good information but...missing something.,"The book is filled with a great deal of relevant information and pictures, but it has one glaring omission. It's missing an index, so finding specific topics can become problematic due to the sheer thickness of the book. Again, very informative though."
3,I want more!,"I downloaded a Kindle version of this book. I found the book really fascinating because I am interested in history and how ordinary people lived in ancient times. The only problem I had with the Kindle version is that the illustrations were not included. I have an imagination and the words help paint a picture in my mind; but the illustrations in the original were mighty helpful. So in this Kindle version, because the illustrations were not included, the reading experience was not as complete or as illuminating. Not having the illustrations, the pictures and the maps, left much to be desired. Can you do something about that?"
1,Manners Custom and Dress During the Middle Ages,"This e-book is slow going. I am reading it on my Samsung Strato. Reading on the Strato is easy and the download from Amazon was easy as well. I haven't found a list of chapters, I can't tell if I am reading the book or the prolog. The pictures don't show up either, there is just the picture captions. Maybe reading it on a full computer would be different. I will keep reading and see how it goes."
3,after reading it,I had a lot of expectations on this book even tho I knew it was a little obsolete and not so punctual. In any case I am glad for the purchase as it can be read without any difficulty by anyone who is curious about the European Middle Ages. Juts for general readers.
3,No images,"This book has good information, but it would be helpful if the images had actually been included, and not just the placeholder text. For the price I paid, I expected images."
4,Diamond in the rough,"This CD is a nice find, especially for the ""true"" Canned Heat fan which I am one. The first album ever given to me was the very first Canned Heat album, and that was the day I became addicted to boogie and blues. The music on this CD is not what you would expect to find on your typical Canned Heat CD. This one takes you through the years, giving you a taste of all the best players through the history of Canned Heat. This is a collection of some of Canned Heats best instrumentals. I enjoyed this one."
4,Cooking Heat!,"Ruf Records and Fito de la Parra have done a great job in assembling these Canned Heat instrumentals (yes, there are some occasional vocals but the overwhelming focus is on the instrumentality). This cd charts the band over almost thirty years and it's a great journey. If you aren't jumping around the room with the joy of all this by the time it's done you must be cloth-eared or clinically dead. Recommended, especially to those who's knowledge of Canned Heat stops at 'Goin' Up The Country'."
4,The meeting of the old and new. An incredible performance.,"There is little question Ronnie Earl is at the top of the blues guitar class and this CD combining the Chicago Blues stlye and passion of Jimmy Rogers and Mr Earl works very well. If you like Chicago Blues, buy it! Oh hell, buy it anyway, you'll learn to love it."
2,more books and movies,still it is a bad movie pls do not buy this moive it is not good ok? ty and bye
3,Not one of Goosebumps best's,"It's an alright 2-episode video tape, but it only includes 2 episodes and it's only 44 minutes long. Instead of releasing the episodes seprateley R.L. Stine should really considder releasingGoosebumps, Season 1, 2 and 3. I would ask for more seasons, but that's all they got, 3 seasons, that's it. And if you read my review on the Scary House DVD then you probably know I thout that was a season. Oh yeah if you haven't seen these episodes yet then don't pay $20 for it."
1,WORST EVER,This movie was soooooo dumb the first one had a stupid ending and made No sence. The second movie was good UNTIL the ending. I REALY TRULY HATED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS MOVIE!!!!!
3,Goosebumps: One Day at Horrorland,"What can I say? I was entertained during my viewing of this episode. Although not one of the show's best, it was often quite funny and sometimes a little forbidding and eerie; but obviously, it is more designed to frighten little ones. This episode was alot of the time designed to be more humorous than scary and for the most part, it succeeds in being a nice little two-part episode. Obviously not on the same lines as ""The Haunted Mask"" episode, but it still was entertaining."
2,It was nothing like the book.,It was very good except for one thing it missed out quite a lot of bits includeing The Doom Slide and the ending was completely different to the book which was frankly better then the telly program. But the sequel which is a com game is much better then the first part of the story.
1,Horrible Horrorland,"We bought this DVD for five bucks, and I think we paid for the entire production. My son is eleven, and he enjoyed the book. Of course adjustments are made for teleplays, like the removal of a character or a changed ending, but it was so laughably awful in acting, costume, script and overall production values, that we were never frightened, and we only laughed in sheet derision. Avoid at any cost. My nine-year-old daughter says, ""I've seen cartoons scarier than this!"""
2,books and movies,i like the book but this movie ugh and i like rl stine a lot but this sry but dont buy this!
4,Goosebumbs One Day at Horrorland DVD,"I Bought this DVD for my 10 year old daughter who is a big goosebumbs fan. One Day at Horrorland was her favorite book, she really enjoyed the movie although it left out alot of the main story. Still very enjoyable. I would recommend for any goosebumbs fans."
5,Helps kids deal with the wait for mail-deliverys!,"I'm waiting for something to come in the mail,and it makes me feel happier when I think of how the Muppet Babies felt when their package didn't come. I feel that way when all we get is either bills for my father or some catalog with clothes in it. It always makes me feel better when I remember the Muppet Babies catching the mail and it's nothing but envelopes-not the ""Build it Yourself Playhouse"". I'm looking for my tape. I think I might find it tommorow in a stack of tapes under the TV. I also liked the other episode where they build their own amusement park. I like how the Muppet Babies help you deal with everyday problems such as I have listed. I highly recommend it for any kid who ever lost hope in the post-office!!:)"
5,deserves a dvd release,"Muppet Babies is the greatest cartoon ever. I mean, The series lasted a total of 107 episodes. They need to be released on DVD. VHS IS SO 80'S. Please release Muppet Babies On DVD!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,trouble with textured walls,I bought the unit several years ago and it works great on smooth walls. Then I put a textured wall in our pantry and the unit would beep all the time.
2,Worked well... at first,"I bought this because I had read the positive reviews and thought I would try it out despite the cheap price, which made me wonder about its quality. I have to admit, the product did work well at first. But after using it just one time, it no longer functions properly!It still alerts me to ""studs"" in the wall, but they are surprisingly never in the same location on the wall twice. I tried it 10 times and had 10 different marks in different locations on my wall. Don't buy the product, but just put the money to getting a nicer product."
1,Depends on who you are,"If you are a plaintiff's attorney or really really stupid this book will appeal to you. It is a self-serving collection of lies, micharacterizations, and falsehoods financed by the ATLA in hopes that gullible voters will take their word for everything that is said. Similar to any Michael Moore film, this book puts its hands over its ears and screams CORPORATIONS, CORPORATIONS, CORPORATIONS!!! at the top of its lungs, expecting that the average reader will agree with its communist leanings and denounce the pigs who place safety before profits.All in all, a waste of time and money."
5,Giselle w/ fabulous Kain & Augustyn,"The partnership of Karen Kain and Frank Augustyn was dynamic in the 1970s when I saw them dance the Bluebird pas de deux in Nureyev's Sleeping Beauty with the National Ballet of Canada at the Met in NY on their first visiting American tour. This 1976 film was made at the height of their professional careers, and it is a wonderful ballet performance DVD experience watching them paired in Giselle. If you are a purist and fault finder about the rest of the production, so be it -- I had seen Makarova's Giselle with ABT in the '70s which was more emotive, but no less technically sound and visually appealing -- however, you cannot deny the talent and attractiveness (she gorgeous & graceful, he a superlative athlete) of the Kain/Augustyn duo, and how fortunate it is to have a full length ballet on DVD featuring them."
2,Definitely not the nicest Giselle ever,"I did not enjoy this dvd that much, Karen is a good dancer but the choreography and stage/ costumes were a bit weird. I also did not like her mad scene, her hair came out all at once and was all over her face the whole time. The Wilis costumes were Yellow! Or looked it, and the way they appeared was so weird. Also they chucked hilarion over the edge of a cliff when they danced him to death. Karens dancing is good and i though the Queen of the Wilis was quite good but all in all i far prefer the Kirov version with Galina Mezentseva and Konstantin Zaklinsky."
2,Everything was tick tocking but the watch,"I have always been satisfied with my purchases thru amazon, but this time I don't know what happened. The watch came in a torn box, it did not have any instructions, it was not attached to the package which was obvious that someone had taken it out of the package and last but not least it did not work. The not working part could have been a dead battery, but when I purchased this watch, I expected it to come to me with working batteries. Sorry, but I was very unhappy with this purchase."
5,The Ghost Who Walks,"I found an old copy of ""The Son of the Phantom"" when I was a kid. It was my first introduction to the character of the Phantom and I loved it. I have bought a copy to give to my nephews so they can share my enjoyment. From what I've read it seems like the plot of the new Phantom movie will be similar to the plot of this book. I wish someone would put out a new version of this book so more people could read it.See alsoThe Phantom: Jungle Action;The Phantom: Death In The Deep Woods"
4,"I don't know much about techno-pop, but...","I hate techno-pop, as a rule. I love this album, though. I bought it fifteen years ago and I still get the urge to put it on the turntable and give it a complete listen-through once in awhile. Too bad the b-side of the single of ""Duel"" isn't on the album. It's like ""Jewel"" only with the lyrics of ""Duel"" shouted in accompaniment. Oh, well, maybe they'll re-release this someday with that as a bonus track."
3,"Slick, lush, electronic pop. Reeks of Trevor Horn","If you already own all of the Art of Noise catalog and are still wanting, give this a spin. Produced by Trevor Horn (of The Buggles), A Secret Wish is chock-full of 80's-isms (orchestra-hit samples, gated reverb snare drums, big keyboard sounds.) At the time, this was all very high-grade and impressive. By today's standards, this record's kind of cute, though. The songs are good enough to overshadow all the hackneyed production clichés."
4,A MASTERPIECE OF 80'S AVANT-GARDE FM RADIO,"The true highlight of this recording is the 2nd track, ""The Murder Of Love"" - this CD is worth the price just for that incredible composition all on its own. Otherwise, an amazing listening experience from start to finish, best played uninterrupted with a great set of headphones."
5,Still Rings True..,"I first heard P-M along with the Smiths ""How Soon is Now"" and i was forever turned to ""new wave"" or ""Mod"" Music back in the eighties...P was WAY ahead of their times and i was glad to have found so early in my lifeEven today, the same tunes still evokes the emotions that it did almost 20 years ago.in order for any music to be great, it must be timeless. i.e. you can't tell when it was made..and this album, my friend, is such an album.it will ring true for me even when i turn eighty!aloha"
5,"Duel, a great song","When Secret Wish was released I was only 9. But some days ago I really got hooked by the song ""Duel"". This is a really great song, like the whole CD."
4,Very 80's,"I heard this material for the first time online. Can't remember the internet station but it may have been Alternative 80's or something like that. I lived in Boston from 1980 to 1987. And was surprised that I don't recall hearing it way back in the day. It seemed to strike a chord with me. Something about the mood of the overall material is very appealing. It has a silly and serious German quality in the lyrics, 'cause they are a German band. Picture Mike Meyer ""Dieter."" But the best songs are haunting and a great document of that time."
4,"A masterpiece, but there's better. . .","I only give four stars for one reason: There is a Japanese edition of ""A Secret Wish"" that includes more and different tracks. Especially ""Dream Within A Dream"" is more ambient, beginning much more smoothly with a solo trumpet floating into the song before the bass. Look out for that import! In addition you will get as bonus tracks the exented versions of ""Dr. Mabuse"", ""P-Machinery"" and ""Duel"" and Propaganda's really cool cover of ""Femme Fatale"". I found that edition already owning the regular one - and it's worth to have both."
4,Hilarious!,"When I first saw this movie, it was at midnight on a random cable channel because I couldn't sleep. Never have I been so grateful for my insomnia! This movie was funny and rang true from begining to end. As a native New Yorker I couldn't stop laughing at every typecast Renee Taylor hit right on the nose, and the witchcraft backdrop reminded me of my grandmother. And who doesn't love the story of Romeo and Juliet? The only thing that annoyed me is I missed the ending, but I'm going to buy myself a copy!"
1,this was one of the dumbest movies ever,"I wouldn't have sat through this movie, or probably have even turned it on, if Angelina Jolie wasn't in it. If you're a fan of hers, this movie might be worth catching on TV just to see one of her earlier roles and hear the accent she does, which I thought was pretty well done. But other than that, there is no reason to watch it. The jokes are lame, the story is just rehashed, poorly written modernized Romeo and Juliet. The characters are flat and you have to reason to understand why these two fell in love, except for a physical attraction, and you find even less reason for their parents eventually agreement. Overal a huge waste of time."
5,Romantic Comedy,Introducing ANGELINA JOLIE!!! This is such a funny movie for anyone who appreciates Italian culture. We are shown a part of the Bronx that's made for Italian's. A lot of talent and laughs.
4,Not bad,Amazon suggested this movie to me. I've never seen it before then. I enjoy some of Angelina's movies. I never seen her in a movie when she was young before. So I was pretty excited about ordering this movie. It wasn't bad. It was a little corny the first time I watched it. About a year later I watched it again and I enjoyed it. I think I expected too much from this movie the first time. And that is why I didn't enjoy it as much.
2,NOT my Big Fat Italian Wedding,I bought this movie for my Italian-American husband who loved My Big Fat Greek Wedding. They are nowhere near the same. I'm actually mystified at the rave reviews. It shows Italian-Americans as mostly white trashy kind of people. I didn't care for the portrayal at all.I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,wow this is dated,"Such a young Angelina Jolie. Old movie, seemingly low budget, I had a hard time trying to get through it."
3,angelina jolie,"i saw it just for angelina. god she is soooooooo beautiful in this movie, other than that the movie is.. bad"
2,not that good,"i didn't think this movie was that good, and only worth watching to see angie, thought i though her accent was horrible. You wonder why she chooses these roles, she is such a good actress, and she is oddly gorgeous. i dont think this movie is worth watching, but for those jolie fans, you don't want to miss it."
3,Functional option for mounting flash off camera,"I chose this item in contrast to many that cost way more and some that cost less. It is a good value and will work for what I bought it for. For my setup, I needed to add a clamp to the bottom, as I'm using this with long primes and they don't always have a hole that this needs to mount to. Adding the clamp allows me to attach to multiple lenses, on available feet."
1,disappointing because the battery was dead,"The watch was very attractive and well priced, but ultimately disappointing because it did not work. Apparently it was shipped with a dead battery which was not checked out in advance. This should not have happened. The watch was returned for a refund."
5,Grace Jones Portfolio,Great! A throwback to the early 80's. Grace is in fine form in this disco CD. I strongly recommend it!
2,Ridiculously Campy,"Having heard the singles from this album ( the club classic I Need A Man and the still gorgeous ballad La Vie En Rose ) I decided to take the plunge and get Grace Jones' debut album Portfolio. Maybe this worked for people in the late seventies when this was released, but of for me, as a whole , it doesn't. This is SO CAMP it should have come with a bag of marshmellos for toasting and a merit badge for anyone capable of sitting through the entire thing. The singles of course I still like. But the remainder of the album is thinner than rice paper. Does the world really need a disco version of Send in the Clowns? I thought not...."
5,Love it or hate it.,"I'm not a critic. I agree with every post here. Good to very, very bad but, for the value of hearing Grace Johns singing songs from ""Annie"" to ""La Vie en Rose"" is worth every penny. I want to know what she was thinking or what her producers were thinking when they made this album. It may be for the die hard fans. At the end of the day I don't dismiss her as a novelty. Yes, she has done better work but if one doesn't take it too seriously it is a good album. Who out there has milked every way to extend a show-tune in disco? People really will ask who the hell is singing the disco version of ""Tomorrow"" or a song from ""La Cage"". Go ahead and laugh but there is no one else like her."
3,You Gotta Lover Her,"Hey, no one ever said that Grace Jones was going to be the next Maria Callas, but she does have the ability to interpret a song in a very distinct and chronilogical manner. I cannot see many young people buying this album or even knowing who Grace is but for those of you who spent the seventies in your favorite dance club, you couldn't escape the sound that Grace made.She is an icon for that time and a symbol of boldness and brashness for that era. Her voice may stray a bit off key but her voice rings with a joy that can only be associated with those times.Here she takes on the standards of the day, mostly from Broadway musicals and adds a bit of her own unique style and salsa reggae flavor.If she can make Conan the Barbarian take notice, she can easily warm your heart as she takes you back to the days when the hustle was the rage!"
1,Sophomoric,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after hearing the author on NPR, but I am thoroughly disappointed. The writing reminds me of student essays shoddily constructed out of poor Internet research. Beyond the factual errors other reviewers have mentioned, the narrative is sloppy and needs a good edit. At times she leaves out critical information, referring to characters she has yet to introduce. She must not have thought anyone would read it to leave it in such a state."
2,American Bloomsbury Disappointing,"I couldn't resist buying American Bloomsbury by Susan Cheever because the subject matter fascinated me. It's about the lives of several renowned American writers in Concord MA in the 1840's, including Louisa May Alcott, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. While the historical facts were indeed fascinating, I found Cheever's writing style to be more like a term paper than what could have been an inspiring and involved account of an amazing intellectual group of individuals who came together and influenced the literary history of our country. Even worse, as I pushed myself through the book, the time line and relationships were presented in a very confusing way, jumping back and forth over the course of a few years. I was glad to read about these incredible writers' lives, but I wish it had been in a more engaging and organized format."
2,Not very good.,"I agree with all of the previous reviews in stating that a lot of the facts are wrong. I'm currently reading The Concord Quartet: Alcott, Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau and the Friendship That Freed the American Mind by Samuel A. Schreiner Jr., and it's a much better book."
2,Sympathy for the slavers,"This is an interesting book--about more interesting people.I must say that I find Ms Cheever's sympathy for the slave holders, antipathy for the abolitionists, and down right disgust for anyone who was moved by John Brown very disturbing. Her heart goes out to the 5 men executed by John Brown in Kansas, but not a word for those who died in the middle passage or more directly as a result of the 'peculiar institution.' She finds it difficult to understand why the Transcendentalists could have been so mislead. They weren't. John Brown was right."
1,A BIG disappointment!,"After reading Megan Marshall's engrossing book about the Peabody sisters, I was intrigued by Susan Cheever's 'American Bloomsbury' and borrowed it from the library. Thank goodness I didn't buy it! A 'nice early review' quoted on Cheever's website (without a source) described the book as a ""dishy romp"" with the ""Concord gang"" and, indeed, Cheever has managed to turn one of the richest, most fascinating periods of American life and letters into a cheesy bodice-ripper. And it's so poorly written! Although Cheever purports to teach writing at the graduate level the book is full of cliches such as ""Alcott's voice reached out through the century,....drawing characters that seem to come alive on the page..."" or clunkers like ""Thoreau...had already written a lot and graduated from Harvard."" Written a lot? After Marshall's vivid, nuanced and thought-provoking depiction of this circle, 'American Bloomsbury' is an embarrassment."
2,Cursory look at literary figures,"I had high hopes for American Bloomsbury after hearing Susan Cheever interviewed on NPR. Some of what she wrote was interesting and new to me, but overall the book was not satisfying. It was interesting to read biographical details, especially of Thoreau and Hawthorne, but I felt that she was just scratching the surface and not really delving into her subjects' lives or works. She also has the annoying habit of adding uninteresting tidbits about her visits to the authors' homes or towns which don't really add anything to the narrative. I don't know enough about these figures to know what I was missing, but that didn't stop me from feeling that there was more to know."
1,Extremely disappointing,"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review. I am not overly-knowledgeable about the ""Concordians,"" but am reasonably literate. I'm much more familiar with the London Bloomsburians, and love literary biography. I am not qualified to speak to the alleged plethora of inaccuracies in the book, but even without that, it's a very disappointing book. Yes, it's readable and somewhat entertaining, but I'm learning very little about the thought and inner lives of the Transcendentalists. The book also moves confusingly between what would charitably be called analysis, and chronology. I suppose this is a fault of editing, but it makes the book less coherent. The only positive to having bought this is that I now plan to read some of the good books recommended by other disappointed reviewers."
2,"Trash Tabloid ""Literary History""","This book reads like a series of front page stories from a trash tabloid. It is gossipy in tone with very little substance or thought. It is as if the author did a skimming summary of other works and through this book together in order to meet a deadline. ""Chapters"" are often 3-4 pages long. At times the leap between topics between chapters leaves one puzzled and confused.She would have done better to created a pot boiler of a 19th century soap opera graphic novel - that would have been worth seeing and would have put the book in the proper context."
2,"Engaging, but is it fiction?","I'm still scratching my head over this one. One the surface, its concept is fascinating: some of the greatest thinkers and strongest personalities of the 19th century presented in an engaging narrative format. Even so, it's hard to tell how much of this book is ""story"" and how much is ""fact"". Cheevers's attempts at presenting a linear narrative are also not so successful. I think it is this ""fiction-like"" presentation that confused me... Each scene had me questioning its authenticity or factual accuracy (even if it was true, it's hard to read it as such)."
2,Book looks better on internet then in real life,"Charming COFFEE TABLE BOOK, and NO more. ""Ultimate"" nothing. Book has no voluptous descriptions, and WHERE is the part that tells you how to choose? I didn't find it in the book. Contents are too utilitarian, and overall book is too boring for the bathtub or bedside, but fine for coffee table. Key perfumes missing. Goes into details and boring history on the HOUSES, NOT the scents themselves. Dissappointing."
3,Okay,This book was okay; but for someone that is looking into adding perfumes to their line of products. Wasn't what I expected.
2,Meh.,It is so-so. Lots of repetition. Didn't really cover a couple of training issues I had. Not bad for beginners.
3,Not quite what I expected...,"A decent book, with some good advice, and some good PR for the breed. However, this author is the same one who has written several other 'Breed for Dummies' books, and apparently hasn't had a lot of experience with all of them. This book would've been much better had it been written by someone with a lot of experience in the breed, like Stratton or Jessup. The training section with simplistic and very biased, the author didn't even mention alternate training methods, and gave no suggestions for what to do if this method doesn't work. The breed specific information in this book can be found on many websites and most pit bull books, and the non-breed specific information is available in any all-breed dog book. This book probably isn't worth the money."
1,Awful...,"I love erasure, but this is not even a songs dvd, it seems like a bad home movie, this is trash... that's where its going..."
2,strange,"Evidently Erasure's Vince Clarke directed this video. Great cover, it has a groove the original lacked ( Peter Gabriel wrote and recorded this one many years ago) but what I can't help asking is WHO DID ANDY BELL'S PLASTIC SURGERY???? He has that pulled-too-tight look about his face that is not only disturbing, but distracting."
1,Garbage,"Doesn't warrant a real review, pure garbage, no value, a waste of a CD. No wonder it sells used for 2 dollars. Don't waste your time."
4,Hiccups for Elephant,The book Hiccups for Elephant is a great children's book. It is about an elephant that has the hiccups. The other animals in the book are trying to sleep. But elephant can't because he has the hiccups. Elephant wakes them up on accident. So in the story all the animals work together. So they can find a way he will stop hiccupping. The book is funny and teaches a great lesson. About how important it is to work together and try to figure things out. This book I think is for kids between ages 4 -7 years old. This is a great book and it's funny. With the small words it helps children learn to read.It's a great book for the kids.The person reading it will enjoy it too.
3,"Red Leaf, Yellow Leaf!","Red Leaf, Yellow Leaf was an all right book! It was about how trees are planted, which leafs belong to which trees, and also how workers come and pick up tree sprouts to get transplanted and they tend them year after year then once the trees start to settle in they get measured, marked, and then uprooted again the workers load the tree up and take it to a place where people can go and buy it and re-plant it in their yard and that's what the kid in the story did! I don't think kids would really enjoy this book because it was pretty boring in my opinion but also very educational to the point kids would learn many things from this book!"
5,Another Brilliant Book By Crispin,"An absolutely wonderful book. The most amazing characters spring forth - the cavalry Major (you must always have a Major) whose happiest day was when they replaced horses with tanks, the inspector who has to baby his pipe so much he can hardly finish a sentence, the spinster sisters who own a horrendous painting they insist is a Botticelli, which they sell tickets to at the annual church fair. They share a hearing aid, and must pass it back and forth during an interrogation. There is also a musician who earns his living writing movie scores (as did Crispin), and must write 12 seconds of music to accompany the monster eating the children. The tavern owner who never gets out of bed, the hunt saboteur who mouths left-wind idiocies. It goes on and on."
4,Nice book with some good twist,"This is my first time reading the a book from this author. So I didn't catch the previous books leading up to this one. I really enjoyed this book and read it in one day. Although I was happy with the way it ended, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Jonas (poor guy)."
4,Good sequel to Unforgettable,"Even tho I enjoyed Unforgettable more, this is still a good story on the 'best friends become lovers (at last)' plot.For some reason I never empathised with the heroine I thought she could not see the obvious and the hero well what took him so long? But as always it all worked out in the end. There were some funny characters Selma, Uncle Willy and Jonas, (hope he hooks up with Toni Wright), deserve their own stories."
5,A Beautiful Story,"I have waited a long time for this story and I must say the wait was worth it. Ophelia & Solomon was meant for each other from the beginning. It seem like everyone around them notice except them even Solomon uncle knew it. It was really nice when both of them stop playing games with each others and face the fact that they were in love. JONAS! What can you say about him, except that he has his own story in the making."
5,Two Hearts Beating As One,"Wow,Wow i just finished The Beautiful Ones and it was outstanding.I could just feel the emotions of the characters as they swirled their way through the thick throngs of love.Along the way i found my self laughing a bit and to my surprise a tear or two was shed along the way.All in all a well crafted love story,one am sure you'll relate to, if youv'e ever been battled tested in the ways of having true love reside in your heart.Much praise Ms.BYRD!!"
5,decent people facing zero tolerance for self-interest,"Rather than a personal account of the Cultural Revolution's horrors, or a big historical overview, Chan, Madsen and Unger give us the story of a local community. Speaking in a matter-of-fact way, the villagers tell us what happened in the waves of political campaigns. As with other puritanical movements of world history, we see the force and appeal of extreme self-righteousness. We see what happens when idealism means zero tolerance for self-interest, and zealots lose almost all restraint in condemning other people's selfishness. We also see how the waves of idealism crest, break, and finally recede before the villagers' basic decency.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"
4,Real Life Examples of How God Wants to Work In Our Lives,Barbies willingness to share a period of brokeness in her life and her spiritual journey is very moving for me. And the way that God speaks to her during this time of her life in His perfect way and perfect timing leaves me craving for the same experience and subsequent blessing more precious than any worldly possession.
3,"wife enjoys it, poorly designed shut off","This product it small discrete and gets the job done. The only flaw is the twist action needed to shut the device off. Twist to turn on then twist to turn off, but a hair pass the off point twist open the battery compartment. It super annoying."
2,"Nice touch, but low quality","I bought the White Nights Doc Johnson Pocket Rocket after purchasing many quality Doc Johnson products, however, when first trying to use the product it took me 5 tries (and 5 different batteries) to actually get the battery to work correctly. The seal, upon further inspection, does not seal tightly enough to allow the battery enough contact with the cells to keep the product going. I've tried to rig the connection and it seems to be working okay, though not as satisfactory as I thought. I would recommend buying this product if you're willing to deal with a less than perfect model."
1,waist of money,I bought it as a gag gift for a baby shower but when I put the battery in and turned it on nothing. I am waiting to hear back from them about wether or not I can return it since it didn't work at all. It's pretty cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. If I was using it as it was intended I think I'd invest in a much better one.
2,Not enough power for me,I have always used vibrating eggs but they would always stop working because of the wiring coming loose. So I decided to try something wireless. I bought this product and while it may have enough power to produce strong enough vibrations for some it certainly doesn't for me.
1,Didn't do anything :(,Tried for 45 minutes and nothing only worth the money you spent on it sadly makes you wanting watt more
4,Great for the price,"It was well worth the price, yes when your turning it off it may open up, But to me it's not much of a problem. It's a little bit noisy but i dont mind. the plastic head did come off, if your picky then it might not be for you. i just wanted something simple and that would give me what i wanted and it does that."
1,Second Flop,This is my second one and it stopped working after 2 uses.I changed batteries and nothing...............Same thing happened before pssshh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Our little fun toy,Was received when promised and in a timely manner and worked great for awhile but after five or ten uses it has started coming apart when it is placed in the off position. At first you could turn it from on to off and it would stay together but now that has changed and it comes apart. When it is on and working it works great and gets the job done. It is just irritating to have to assemble it before each use.
3,helpful little tool,"Well, I was wanting a small vibrator, didn't know what to start with. Saw this on amazon, reviews were good, so I got one and really have enjoyed it. I take medicine that has some sexual side effects, so this little tool works well for us. Be careful when turning it off, if you turn it too far the batteries will fall out. Great for the shower, just keep the plastic cap on."
5,Still Love it and Buying a New Copy!,"I bought this album on vinyl when it was released (what, 20 years ago?). Like a dummy, I gave away all of my vinyl a long time ago. I just came across this album again (on CD) and was so pleased that it lived up to my memories of it. The songs are infectious, gorgeous. Badarou is a genius and even if you don't usually like synthesizer, you owe it to yourself to check this out (then listen to Art of Noise's ""Ambient Collection"" if you liked this one)."
3,Newer version is better,"I'd admit, when I first got this figure I fell in love with it. That being said, the newer version (Vintage or Saga Legends) is a whole lot better. This IG-88 is stiff and the wiring is attached to his body. In the newer version, the wires look realistic and creep next to the body. Check it out!"
2,Not as advertised,"This product was a gift and I was sadly informed it was a ""multi-language"" toy-not how it was advertised online. I would not have purchased this if I had known it had this added component."
4,I loved the book very much,"Although I didn't read the whole book,I feel like I know everything already. I learned a lot from this book."
1,Cheap,"These are poorly made and do not work very well. They don't hold an edge, and extremely sharp tools are a requirement for wood turning. They seem to be made from some low quality steel, and tend to burn when sharpened on a grinder. However, they were not expensive, and I guess you get what you pay for. Over all, if you are a beginning turner like I am, my advice is to spring for the more expensive tools, you will be more happy with them during use."
2,Save your money and buy good chisels,"The old addage ""you get what you pay for"" is certainly true with these chisels. They are not straight, the wood is cheap and splits easily, The metal collets offer no support what so ever. Bottom line. Save your money and get some GOOD chisels."
2,Low quality,Very cheaply made as reflected by the price. Doesn't hold edges and the handles eventually separate from the shank.May be good for occasional fine work but that's it.The handles feel very light thus the balance of the chisels is off making them difficult to hold steady while turning.
3,Formatting Issues,"There are some formatting issues especially where the line numbers are concerned and with the e-Edition they should have included colour plates because of all the tablets out there now...or just B/W plates if they're thinking of the Kindle devices...but the Fire will be out soon so....The poems are, of course, brilliant but this is just another formatting flub I've a number of times from reputable publishers who've rushed their ebook versions into press without proper editing."
2,it seems the published never tok in the hand a book,Horrendous binding: too much glue on the back; on the top of that sheets too thick. Result: you can not keep the book open without a sensible constant effort. This takes away a remarkable part of the pleasure of reading.
5,Why no reviews of the Longman edition?,"As I write this there are seven reviews of this book on the page for the Longman Annotated English Poets edition of Blake, and not a one of them is about this edition. They are mainly people arguing that Blake is a good poet and should be read, or complaining about the Penguin edition of his works. What gives? I want to know if I should spend the money on THIS EDITION, the one on whose page I am currently writing this review, the one that is quite expensive, and the one whose product page does not, for some annoying reason, disclose whether it contains the colored plates that probably belong in any expensive edition of Blake. Does it?"
3,the little lamb has no idea,"blake's poems are not black ink on these newsprint pages...blake's poems are engraved plates wild and colorful...but it's fantastic anyway blake is not The Lamb and not The Tygertirzah los orc urizen enitharmon vala rahab urthona, all divided and united in the cruelties of holiness...jerusalem the four zoas the book of urizen the song of los...echoing our cries."
4,Plenty of Salient Points to Ponder,"This is an important book. Wayne Dawkins providesan insider's view of a pivotal decade in the historyof the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ).As Dawkins points out, black journalists, while stillseverely underrepresented in print and broadcast media,are indispensable and invaluable in the coverage of every major event in the 1990s, including the Los Angeles riots,O.J. Simpson trial, Million Man March and U.S. presidential elections.However, black journalists and NABJ still face significant challenges, not the least of which is NABJ's effort to growits organization in the face of declining membership, attackson media diversity and a certain apathy among many blacks inthe profession.Dawkins examines these challenges in Rugged Waterswhile providing plenty of salient points to ponder."
1,"Poorly written, a waste of time","A poor read, full of socialist views. It amazes me this lady can make a living."
4,"Odd, Strange.......But Oh So Good!",Everyone is pretty used to this eccentric lady's vocal-ability'sand this album is older but sure still very enjoyable.Nex to amanda Lear Grace is one that still keeps going strong World wide.Buy the Cd and get carried away by the woman called Grace Jones..............
4,One of her very best recordings!,"Grace Jones debut album on Island Records was one of the best in her relativley short music career. A cool blend of funk, new wave, reggae and rock all add to the greatness of this underated album. The album vastly consists of cover versions of tracks as diverse as PRIVATE LIFE, LOVE IS THE DRUG and a great pumping remake of Tamla Motowns THE HUNTER GETS CAPTURED BY THE GAME with that being one of the highlights of the album, showcasing Jones' vocal abilities. The album also scores well on the rock driven track BREAKDOWN and the pleasantly mellow, PARS. The album ranges from good to very good and is one well worth having if you're a Grace Jones fan."
4,Testing on a Grand Scale,"This book isn't for the teacher who'd like to make a weekly quiz for their class. This is intended for those who are interested in large scale institutional testing, like TOEFL. It doesn't give much information on writing test items, but covers how to write testing guidelines in great detail. It also covers how to evaluate items and tests, and it goes into detail about reliability and validity without getting to deep into statistics. In general, I found the style of this book to be very easy to read since it is written with test administrators in mind rather than test writting techies. If you're interested in the process of making large scale institutional tests, then this is a good book, but if you're looking for a book to help you write test items, then you should look elsewhere."
4,KB Gear JamCam,"I've had the JamCam now for about a month and it performs as well as you would expect a $50 digital camera to perform. Actually, it takes pretty good pictures and are wonderful for e-mail or posting to a web site.The one complaint I have is that I could'nt use a MMC (multi media card) reader. Something about ""proprietary format"", which I don't know much about. I have to say though, My batteries are still going strong and I've downloaded about 250 pictures using the usb cable.All in all You can't beat the price. I would recomend it as a good camera to keep in the car.One more thing. Get a 16MB memory card to go with it. It increases your max photos to 69 in high resolution."
1,Don't Buy This Product,I could not get the JamCam software to work on either of my systems: Windows 2000 or Windows XP. I have installed a lot of software over many years and it is obvious when a product is poorly designed. It is clearly not designed for XP. The uninstall removes system drivers that XP has to replace. Software should not be this difficult to install or use. Do yourself a favor: spend a couple of more bucks and get a quality product.
1,Just not worth the trouble,"This is a word of advice to any would-be buyers of the jamcam 3.0: ""Don't!"". The product is a toy at best. But the real problem (yes, there is one worse) is the business practices of this company. Non-existent customer support (emails bounce), invalid toll-free numbers, and unclaimable rebate offers. There is defintiely something fishy going on. I would go as far as to say beware of KBgear in general. I learned at a price. I rate this product a one-star only b/c a zero rating is not possible."
1,Garbage,"Do not buy this camera. The software is terrible and the drivers don't install correctly in Windows 2000. After I finally got the thing installed, I took some pictures. It takes a long time to take one picture and you have to hold the camera still while you do it. Downloading the pictures from the camera to the PC via USB is very slow as well. The most disappointing thing about this camera is the picture quality. Quite honestly, the other problems were nothing because this camera is so inexpensive... but the picture quality is terrible. Even in the highest resolution it looks awful. Each pixel looks about 8 times bigger than it should be in the highest resolution. Worst digital camera ever."
4,need the software,I need the soft ware for the cam mine has a crack in it from missuse if u have it i would realy apreciate it send it to me ty a little gift would b sent rite back
1,Stay away from it!,"This camera has been a complete waste of money. I have not been able to get it to work on any of three different computers with Windows 95, Windows ME or Windows XP. The customer service number printed in the manual is a false number and there is no contact or help in their website. Money is better spent with a more reputable company."
1,Garbage!,"Not even a child will be happy with the pictures that this ""camera"" produces! Horrible color, horrible clarity. There is NOTHING to recommend this camera unless you want to dissuade your kid from photography forever.The company seems to have gone belly up as the phone numbers have been disconnected. So don't expect a rebate if you were foolish enough (as I was) to purchase this worthless product."
1,KB Gear did not honor rebate,"The camera is mediocre at best. Really do need the extra multimedia memory though. No LCD for previewing pictures is a real handicap. Lots of my pictures don't come out at all. It seems to be very lighting sensitive. The battery wears down very quickly too. Get a rechargeable ... you'll need it. For what I ended up paying, I expect a lot more quality in the pictures."
1,JamCam 3.0 looks good; works badly,"... I hope XP Pro works a lot differently from XP home. I purchased a JamCam 3.0 for my 9-year old and tried moving pictures to a Dell 8200 machine. So far, no luck: XP Home complains about non-compliant software and drivers, KB Gear tech support offers updated drivers and updates to the JamCam software (both, incidentally, are needed to make XP happy.) Well, I followed all the instructions and advice - hours of work checking cable connections, USB ports, telling XP where to find the new updated JamCam drivers (c:\windows\system\system32\drivers) - to no avail! I am now convinced that the JamCam software is not XP ready. I'll try it on a laptop with 98 and see how it goes. Bad, bad, bad. It's really too bad because the JamCam is a nice piece of hardware for kids."
4,Worth the Price,"This is a cool little camera for the price. It's not going to impress any professional photographers and can't really compete with a [price] hi-res digital cam. However, for the cost of a couple rolls of film you get a great little point and shoot. Bought this for my 4 year-old daughter for Christmas and she is having an absolute blast with it! She has even managed to take some pretty good-looking pictures. Pros: Simple to use, battery life is about like other dig. cams, decent picture quality, software is fair, unit seems durable. Cons: Serial interface is SLOW (USB is tolerable). You will definately want a memory card - the defualt 8 picture storage just isn't enough Also, make sure you follow the manufacturer's recommendations and use only SANDISK memory. I tried another brand first and it did not work properly with this cam."
3,If you are buying this camera for the Rebate Forget it.,"The camera is average and does a decent job if using for ebay. However, I know three people (myself and 2 others) who have purchased this camera because of the mail in rebate and none of us (even after repeated phone calls) have received our rebate."
2,Hints on MMC card with this camera,"Forget the rebate -- it appears they are about of business.If you want to use an MMC card to expand the memory, try wedging in a thin piece of cardboard on top of the card. Otherwise, it doesn't get a good connection and you lose all your pictures and/or the camera locks up."
2,Camera works great but forget about getting your rebate!,"I purchased this camera in July of 2001. The camera works exactly as described and is very good for home purposes. Unfortunately, the rebate which was a major part of the reason why I purchased this model still has not been paid. The customer service department at Kb Gear Jamcam was not very helpful. They continue to tell me it is being processed. I have recommended this camera to others to purchase and they too have never received their rebate. Good camera, but beware of the customer service."
3,JAMCAM - What you would expect,Bought it for my 9 year old. Takes pretty good pictures. I am using it with Windows 95 sdo I had to use the serial cable-Which means I had to get a PS2 Mouse and open up a serial port - (this is described on the web page for jam cam. ) Once I did that it worked like a charm. I now need an MMC card just so we can download less often. A great camera for the price - Others in this price range do not give you a flash and must be used with more modern systems like Windows 98 or later. I'd do it again - a great starter camera for a low price.
1,This camera sucks!,"It is not compatible with Windows XP despite the defunct company's claim on the web site. I spent hours trying to install the drivers to get the software to work, to no avail. Not at all user friendly. Additionally, the company is out of business (wonder why?) so there is no tech support via phone or email. Stay away!"
4,"Good ""Toy"" Camera","Good camera for the price. The sweet spot for the fixed focal length lens appears to be about 5 feet. This is the perfect digital camera for a child or young adult - a much better choice than those ""disposable"" 35mm cameras. Noticed some weird pixelation when the camera got closer to the subject (at or around 3 feet). The colors sometimes get washed out by the flash."
1,Should have just burned my money. Would get more enjoyment.,"First off I don't know why the camera says it take 800 x 600 pixels? The Highest res. I can get is 640 x 480 pixels???? Second when I center someone or something and take a picture, they are not centered in the pic. I have to move the camera so the person or object of interest is in the right corner of the the camera just to get them centered in the pic! The software was, well ok I guess. Overall this camera should be recalled! ... In case you do buy it, for the best image quality you need to set the timer and put it down. Make sure you have good lighting, the images always seemed to bright or way to dark. Outside pics seamed to work best. ... Oh ya the only reason I gave the camera a STAR is because it made me!!!!!"
4,Fun little camera,Bought the camera about a week ago and use it on my Mac and son's PC. Had no trouble loading it on either-very simple. Take's a great picture for e-mailing etc. Would recommend the camera for anyone who wants to get into digital cameras and not spend a lot of money.
4,A Good Little Product,"I bought this JamCam with low expectations. Turned out to be a good deal (...). Running mine on one of our older systems-233 with win95. Exceptionally quick downloads and using something like VicMan's Photo Editor adds to the fun. Pictures taken in low light conditions outside or in and with flash, come out very well. Pictures taken indoors of people and in a place such as a kitchen and with 3-60 watt bulbs overhead (and flash not used) come out perfect. Use only high quality batteries such as Duracell etc. as any others won't do. Invest in a 9-volt adapter for downloads to PC and use only the highest quality rechargeable if you go the other route for the 9 volt. Software is simple to install and very little reading of the manual is required. Get the hang of it for awhile by playing around, you'll find its worth more than you paid. MMC cards apparently have capacity for 10 million pic repeats, best advice: buy the lower mb storage ones."
3,Good deal for the [money] but doesn't work with Windows XP,"This camera was a good deal when we got it. It suited our purposes just fine. Taking quick pictures to upload to the internet or send over an e-mail. Picture quality is not great if trying to blow up a pic or print it out, but that was expected for the price. However, we upgraded our operating system from Windows 98 to Windows XP and suddenly the program could no longer detect the camera. Downloaded the new XP compatible drivers and it still doesn't work. Thank goodness the kids computer has Windows 98 still and we can use it on there, but if it didn't...waste of my money.I would say not to buy this camera unless you plan on never upgrading past Windows 98."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I have used this camera for about 2 years. It takes nice pictures for emailing, but they aren't great quality for prints. I OFTEN have problems with the software...."
3,camera seems great....downloading is the problem,"We have tried downloading pictures, after much difficulty just installing the software and receive error-log messages. After some experimenting we have determined the program will only download our pictures taken in the higher resolution don't try taking pictures in at the lower resolution."
1,Where is the help when I need it?,"I have recieved a jamcam for christmas. I am sure it is a great camera. I doubt if I will ever know. During the christmas hub I managed to lose the disk. I have written to jamcam ""webmaster"" only to have the email sent back as being unable to deliver. I have conatced Kbear only to find out that they do not have the software and I need to contact jamcam ""webmaster"". Why would they bother to put a web page that claims to be for help, when it really is no help at all. Can someone help me get a disk with the proper software?"
2,"Limited use camera, Lower end Company","Camera OK for well lighted area, small size photo, Goodfor Kids and web use...software furnished had some problemsbut worked it out..(time involved).Company did not send rebate and phones numbers furnishedwere invaled..put your money into something better from abetter company."
5,Outstanding camera,I have had my JamCam for about 1 year and I am very pleased with it. I would thoroughly advise anyone who is in need of an inexpensive and good digital camera to purchase this one.
1,"Company out of business, camera horrible","I bought this camera based on Amazon.com reviews stating it was fine for family emailing. It arrived and looked easy. Come to find out, the software included is outdated for any of the new windows software. It can not find the ports or drivers in it's install. Tried to contact company to find that the phone is disconnected and company website shutdown. Spent two days trying to download the driver software I needed off the internet and none of it worked. I do NOT recommend this camera at all - there is no support for it if you have any issues. I notice that it's for sale everywhere, and given the company has gone under, find this to be very bad ""retailmanship""."
3,use on windows xp,"I'm not interested in reviewing this camera ( I think its OK), but just letting people with one know that it will work with windows xp if you use the serial cable - the downloads take about a minute each, but they DO download."
2,Don't expect much.,"The camera itself is a nice device to start with; it lacks a few features, but for $(...), I can live without them. Where the product falls flat on it's face is the software that comes with it. There's no way to get images out of the camera without the software, which looks like it was done by a not-very-talented high schooler as their first 'real' program, and has the bugs and glitches to prove it. Electronic support is limited to the online 'knowledge base' and download areas - no mention of any customer support or other contact, other than the webmaster. A feedback/problem letter has gone unanswered for over a month.I'd rate the camera at 4 stars; the software drags the whole thing down to 2."
3,Okay for limited duty.,"I've owned mine for over a year & have been impressed with it in several ways. First is the new, lowered price; real digital cameras at such a nice price are quite a development! The applications this camera seems best suited to are: e-mailing photos, webpage posting or limited photo printing (4"" x 6"" max), as in school papers or nonprofessional grade work reports. The resolution is up to these tasks, but not much more. It has no zoom lens, which limits its usefulness. It does have a good indoor flash, and it has an expandable memory (MultiMediaCards, generally harder to find & a bit higher cost than other memory formats). The camera will download into the PC via USB (forget about painfully slow serial port options), but the only way to fly is to use a separate MMC card reader (a little more $, but no battery use and much better speed). All in all, this is a great camera for younger students and beginners whose main interest is computer-based digital photography."
4,great camera to take whereever.,this is great camera. I've had it for awhile its great to email pictures and and even printing but small pictures are bad. get an MMC card yes you need this for this camera. is fun to do. even seems better than my cusins hi tech camera. so I would recommend this with a MMC card. good luck. its good for first time digital camera.
1,HORRIBLE....WASTE OF MONEY,"I purchased the JamCam 3.0 for my son...what a total waste of money...there are no drivers on the cd so you have to go to either KB Gear's website or JamCam's and try to find a link that actually works, if you find that and click on download you get a window with the QuickTime icon that does NOTHING...no drivers, no pictures...when my computer tries to find the hardware it doesn't exist even though its been properly installed as per the instructions included in the user's guide...also they DON'T respond to any of the emails regarding these problems...what a waste!"
1,Ouch!!!,"Do not buy this if you have Windows XP. I bought the camera for my children because it sounded perfect for them. I was fooled by the Windows XP downloads available on the products website. I spent 2 days installing, uninstalling, trying to contact the company, and searching their help database. Nothing worked. So I have nothing good to say. (Their phone number is disconnected.)When I bought the camera my expectations were low. I understand you get what you pay for. After all it was only for my kids to play with. But I did expect it to at least work. It failed at that."
3,Decent camera for the price,"This camera would be great for kids. It's easy to use and does pretty much what it is described to do. For this price, though, don't expect miracles. I'm afraid you'll have to pay much, much more for a good digital camera."
1,Stay away,"Not wanting to commit to a $300 camera purchase, I tried this as an interim solution just so I could take digital pictures. It seriously has some problems. I could not get this working under windows 2000, even though there is a limited FAQ on their page that says it will work with it, though I still had some problems. I mailed support, told them that I've read the FAQ, did everything, still getting this message, and they respond to me w/ cut and paste off the FAQ. I also had some problems geting it to work under windows 98 through the native USB interface, but after it installs like 8 software packages one of them could talk to the camera. Then I finally saw my picture. It came out so awful I seriously can't even describe it. Like 16 color, scaled up pixellated image that made me howl. Anyway, I was expecting it to be a low quality, fun, yet workable camera, and it was so far below that. Stay away!"
1,VERY BAD CAMERA,"Im telling you, do not buy this camera. It's not even worth...dollars. The pictures are come out very blurry, and the flash is so bright.. You could get blind from it. And not to mention you have to buy a battery for it every 2 weeks. overall i rate this camera zero stars, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. even if your a begginer."
2,This is really not a digital camera,The jam cam looked so cool up until I opend it! This is not a digital camera it dosen't have a monitor. You have to upload the pics onto your computer just to look at how they came out!
1,Jam Cam company not reliable,"I purchested a Jam Cam about 1 year ago and it was working fine and then something went wrong with the program--It will not download my pictures anymore. I have tried to contact JamCam and the sight just tells me it is for Sale. I have asked on the internet and read some reviews for this and they are all in the same boat as me. I would not recomment this camera to anyone for any price and you should be ashamed to even advertise this product, because there is no way to contact them if something is wrong."
1,"Great digital camera for the price, BUT","Great digital camera for the price, but KB Gear did not upgrade its software to run under Windows XP. I gave it to my son who has an Apple computer and he still uses it."
3,It's better than I expected for the price,"I was looking for [an inexpensive] digital camera for posting to web based auctions. Well, this is about as [inexpensive] as it gets. Yes, the OEM battery won't last a day, but the good one I bought has lasted for 3 dozen pictures *and* downloads and is still going. If you're looking for something to use like a *real* camera, buy something else. If you want to email pictures to friends or post pictures on an auction site, this camera will work until you want to spend enough money for a real digital camera."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought this same camera ... and took it home and had nothing but problems. I have windows 2000 and the USB would not work at all, and I could not find updated drivers for it. The serial port finally worked after rebooting a couple times, but as you can imagine, it was pretty slow. Then, after a few days of having it, the LCD on the back of the camera started displaying non-letters, and the camera would not respond, even when it was reset by removing the batteries."
1,Frustrated in Texas,"The unit simply did not work. I couldn't get it to work and neither could any friends or associates. The USB plug into the camera did not fit correctly. The phone number provided in the back of the instructions was ""no longer in service"" and the ""contact us"" portion of the web site was (unbelievably) inoperable. My adice is to STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! JH"
1,do not purchase this camera,the quality is less than stellar(to put it very nicely). The batteries die really quick too. I got it as a gift but if you are debating on whether or not you should? dont buy it. I would definitely save up and buy another camera. You can buy it on ebay for $5 -10...which is somewhat worth the price.hope I helped.
2,Problems with windows XP,"The camera is easy to use, especially for kids (bought it for my daughter). But when I tried to upgrade it for windows XP it was and upgrade nightmare. I found a website with the stuff I needed, but even they said it was going to be rough and may not work, luckily it did. Total time for finding and upgrading was almost 2 hours. The website was thejamcam.com."
1,Don't bother.,"If your into pictures at all, don't bother with this camera. The picture quality on your computer screen is washed out and uneven...I'd hate to see what it looked like if I chose to print it. Outdoor shots are a little bit better, but all in all I'd put my money in a better quality digital camera."
4,The BEST CHEAP digicam u can buy,"I just got the JAMCAM 3.0 in the mail today. WOW! It's really cool. This cam has the most features u can get for a less than 100$ digicam (Multimedia card expansion- i also bought a 28MB MMC so now i can keep about 120 pictures in the best quality, USB connection-really fast, and really easy to use). The picture Quality is really cool(except for indoor pictures- when it uses flash the object needs to be far away or get washed out and when it doesn't use flash the colors come out strange. That is the case in indoor only). GET THIS CAM if you are into gadgets or want to buy it to your kid. I am 19 yrs old and love it. Amazing huh?"
3,NO SUPPORT,"THE CAMERA IS NOT BAD.THE JAMCAM WAS A GIFT FOR A 10 YEAR OLD.I LOADED THE SOFTWARE ON MY COMPUTER TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT SO I COULD TEACH THE 10 YR OLD. THE PICTURES WOULDNOT DOWN LOAD FROM THE JAMCAM .I CALLED THE SUPPORT LINE ""A TOLL CALL"",AFTER AN HOUR OF TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WE GOT IT YO WORK .IN THE PROSSES MY DESKTOP AND INTERNET GOT MESSEDUP AND I HAD TO RELOAD MY SOFTWEAR. THE TEC REP TOLD ME HE HAD NEVER SEEN A JAMCAM. WHEN I TRYED TO LOAD THE SOFTWEAR ON THE 10 YR OLD'S COMPUTER THE PICTUERS WOULD NOT DOWNLOAD.I CALLED THE SUPPORT LINE AND IT WAS OUT OF SERVICE. I E-MAILED JAMCAM AND AM STILL WAITING FOR AN ANSWER."
1,Jamcam 3 digital camera,"it has poor resolution, no battery, no memory and is basically a toy for kids. KBGear attracts buyers with a phony $30 rebate and then goes to great efforts to cheat people out of it. First they send a postcard saying ""this item is not valid for rebate"" then they have one phone # refer you to second and then a third which never answers. Emails to KBGear also go unanswered. I have spoken to numerous people who all had the same experience. Avoid this dishonest company."
1,Not compatible with some models of Compaq Presario,"This camera is NOT compatible with some models of Compaq Presario. Although mine, which runs Win 98, is NOT the one mentioned at their website, it didn't work. I spent more than 1 hour talking to customer service (very friendly, but it's NOT a toll-free number!) and they didn't have a clue about it. I had to return the camera just a few days after I got it. I can say you run out of batteries pretty fast: I took only a couple of pictures (about 8, the maximum capacity without extra memory) and the indicator was already in the middle. Even if the camera works for you, download the newest drivers from their site and you can get free extra memory."
4,a few great songs,"Hello, I've bought the CD. The best songs are: Lloraras, La Murga and Raquel. El Canario should have included anotrher song. Also, Cali Pachanguero or Pa'Bravo Yo could make a more complete guide to what Salsa is.Enjoy!"
5,Blues,"I discovered Ronnie Earl recently and have been buying everything I can of his. For a person who likes electric, modern blues, he is unsurpassed! Just sorry it took so long for me to discover him. He is right up there with SRV! as far as playig that blues guitar."
1,"So Beautiful, So Useless","This 2012 calendar is the 4th Vettriano wall calendar I have had. This year, they switched the date format up, so that the weeks start on Mondays. Not a big deal at first, but when every other calendar I use has a Sunday start: my iPhone, iPad, Outlook, etc, it makes this one cumbersome to use. I have it hanging in my office and while I am on a call with a client, I need to be able to know at a glance, what day we are talking about. This doesn't cut it.It's like a bad date: All show and no substance."
3,"good pictures, not much information","Someone else described this as a ""coffee table"" book. that is exactly right. the pictures are nice, but there is not much information in it. If you are looking for a book about sedona to help you know what to do there or how to get around or just good basic information - you won't find it here. and it's too big to take it with you on vacation."
4,"Okay, but not what I was looking for","This is a large, thin paperback which would probably be a nice souvenir of Sedona (I haven't been yet!) but was not what I was hoping for. It's my own fault for not reading the reviews more closely. It's a little more useful than a (very) similar book called ""Secret Sedona"" which is also a large thin, paperback filled with nice photographs but not the practical information I am looking for as I plan our upcoming trip. I bought several books about Sedona from Amazon recently and none of them have been as useful as the information I can find on the web."
3,Really small,"I was expecting this to be a lot bigger. If you need a small funnel, then it sure does funnel stuff."
5,Plesant scent,"Now that I have this cleaner, it's true that I clean my counters more often. The scent is pleasing and it cuts grease quite well."
4,Works fine- would like more grapefruit scent,"No issues with the cleaning ability of this product. I would like to smell more grapefruit scent, though the general fragrance is citrusy and pleasant. I do like that the products are not tested on critters, and are safer than the commercial products."
4,Who is mad?,"Agnes open the play with a monologue in which she contemplates the possibility that one day, unexpectedly, she might turn mad. She says she contemplates it with astonishment, but she does not sound very astonished at all, she is more... fashinated by the idea. Her husband is listening, but not listening at all as if he could not hear Agnes, or her talking about the possibility of becoming mad was perfectly normal, or she has been mad a long time and he discounts her.I won't spoil the play, but (for me) it is an interesting investigation in what it means to be mad. Indeed it is not clear who is mad, probably all of them, possibly none. The bounderies of madness are not clearly drawn and characters seem to shift in and out of it on a continuous basis. Rules of the polite society are called into question. Is it mad to break them or to upkeep them?The play is enjoyable to read, but not overly so, it is above everything else, enjoyable to think about."
4,One of the coolest X-Mas albums around,"I first discovered Charles Brown on Alligator's great Christmas collect. The track that is on that collection 'Merry Christmas Baby' is also the first track and the finest on this album as well. This is by no means a one or two hit wonder. This whole CD is fanastic! Charles Brown has a distinc vocal style, which is covered in a mellow smokey blues sound. His piano playing is sparse, but excellent and his backing band is very capable. Charles guitarist also plays a very sparse style as well leaving plenty of room for Charles great vocals. He sings like no other and willbring you in instantly. Listing to this album makes you want to spike the egg nog and start a fire in the fireplace. If you like the blue and\or like great Christmas music buy this album. You will not be disappointed."
2,"Good, with a caveat","Charles Brown is a blues legend and this CD purports to present a selection of his classics. But beware: Though not advertized as such, several of his most famous tracks are later recordings and nowhere near as satisfying as the originals. Though his original Christmas album is unfortunately out of print, you may want to try and find it used somewhere else. It will be worth the effort as it is one of the greatest Christmas blues albums, along with James Brown's ""Santa, Please Come to the Ghetto."""
1,Don't Buy if You're Looking for the Classic Please Come Home for Christmas!,"The sole reason I ordered this was for the classic ""Please Come Home for Christmas"" - even thought its Charles Brown, the version on this CD is different, its terrrible and is not the one that became the gold standard for R&B Christmas tunes - I didn't even bother to listen to anything else on the disc, Very disappointing."
2,Disappointing DVD of a Classic SF Series,"Oldies.com has been releasing the Rocky Jones series (classic SF from the 50s) on DVD--admittedly, only in the compilation versions rather than the TV episodes they originally were, but still, they've been releasing them.This particular serial is one of the more entertaining ones, but to look at it, absolutely no quality control was performed. The video looks as though it was transferred directly from VHS (including frequent interference patterns when the picture brightens during the many explosions), the sound quality is uneven, and it's just a disappointment.Here's hoping other Rocky Jones releases will be better-done; this one was disappointing in the extreme."
4,Both one of Wambaugh's funniest and one of his most heart-wrenching,"This isn't quite up to classics like THE NEW CENTAURIANS, THE BLUE KNIGHT, or THE CHOIRBOYS, but I do consider it as one of his best lesser known books. The introductions to each of the characters are often hilarous as we see various ""clowns"" hired into the Mineral Springs PD by the title character. However, one might become a bit impatient since you need to get well into the book before you have a true sense of where the story is going. Buried under the many anecdotal type scenes, but ultimately rising into prominance is the common bond linkng the title character, the main investigative officer, and the millionaire who hires the latter, and it's this theme that gives the entire book meaning and rewards the patient reader."
3,The Usual,"Wambaugh formula--middle-aged cops who eat & drink too much, who've seen too much & lost too much, and are so burned out that they're looking for another life, if they're lucky enough to reach retirement. And a mystery to be solved, from the thinnest of clues, with a bent ending & no resolution. And all wrapped in stories cops tell each other--with great dialogue, well developed male characters, and one-dimensional females. Ah, the job, the job! Starting each of the early chapters off with point-of-view that shifts with each character was irksome to me, but, otherwise, a good read, overlong for its novella content. Here's its irony: Wambaugh is trapped in the world that his characters are trying to escape, even as he writes about it. Experience makes cynics of us all, and cops get cynical fast, including those who write about what they learned."
1,How did this book get published?,"I finished this book last night and went, this afternoon, to AMAZON to check the reader reviews. I am surprised that people liked this book. The plot is silly, goes nowhere, and started from nowhere. Several of the scenes and characters are not even tangentially related to the story. I've never read any other of his books. I'm sure others have to be better or else this one would not have been published."
4,can't tell the difference,There are cut marks. One of the reviewers said that the sealer rolls didn't have cutting marks. They most certainly do. I like the narrower size as I can divide food into individual serving more readily.
4,Good Product Good Retailer DotComParts,The K&N filter was protected by an outer box with packing around the retail box contained inside. There was no damage to the filter and the filter was exactly as described in the product description. The shipment was on time and I was notified when and how it was shipped via email. I would by from DotComParts again.
5,I want to believe / the truth is out there...,"It's fashionable to have a K&N Filter. I don't know if it does what is purported, and I have no way of proving it doesn't. Ergo, I can at least rest easily knowing I am trying to give my 460 BB Ford the air it needs. I honestly can't discern any change in performance or gas mileage."
1,"cheap looking, very low quality item","the item does not look like an oil bronzed. There is a uneven brown paint with some yellow spots and scratches. It is a very low quality item, not worth $94. You will very disappointed! I would not recommend this item."
3,How to honor the past and be in the present,"3 1/2With his sophomore release, Pine already is assuredly conjuring some of Coltrane's smoother, less-combative, mid-career quartet work along with offering subtle ways to look forward. Sure, he is not the seminal blower who produces line after line of profound soloing, but between many inspired runs and the compositional openness Pine surrounds himself with he elevates what could have been simply routine post-bebop."
5,I LOVE COLLAGE'S MUSIC,WOW I LOVE COLLAGE'S MUSIC.I DONT LISTEN TO ANY OTHER SONGS BUT ALL OF COLLAGE'S ALL THE TIME.HIS MUSIC IS AWESOME I HOPE HE KEEPS MAKING MORE AND SOON.HE'S A COOL DUDE
4,"funny, nevrotic and eccentric","as I sayd: funny, nevrotic and eccentric.it's great!!!! just listen and DANCE it!!"
4,Very good tool,"Tool cuts great. The bottoming design makes it difficult to over do it reaming primer pockets. The stock handle is knurled for a good grip, although its small size makes my hand cramp after a while, which is the only reason this isn't a five star review. Chucking the cutter into an electric drill solves that little problem nicely. Like that, I was able to cut the crimps out of about a hundred rounds of lake city .308 brass in around ten minutes. I highly recommend this tool."
5,It's a good story and very good characters,I like Noah Gordon books and this is one of the good stories.A doctor during the American Revolution. If you like good reading and American History.You must read it.
1,Junk Plastic,The plastic cover of this wall outlet is a piece of junk. It's so hard to make this plastic piece flush to the wall with the rubber gasket it comes with. Don't waste your money on a piece of junk like this. All the other items I have bought from Hansgrohe were very good so I don't know how they could design something like this. Why can't they make this piece metal & screw directly onto the nipple on the wall. Can somebody tell me where I can purchase a good wall outlet that is not made of plastic & comes in brused nickle?
5,Solid as a Rubber Rock,Do not hesitate to buy this if you are worried that the ball will not hold up to the abuse that you are considering. This ball is solid and durable. It will even hold up to bouncing off the floor or a wall with no complaints. It's about the size of a #5 soccer ball so is great for goalkeeper or throw-in distance training. Excellent for core training and young players like the novelty of using it.
3,"Great shoe, but sizing is tricky","These shoes are fine if you can get the right size. I've ordered several in the same size and they were actually different. Watch the Youth versus Adult as they vary in width, but not length in the same size. They are a great shoe to wear in the summer, they dry quickly and can just get washed with the hose."
4,Love Dem Crocs!,"Love Crocs for my toddler. He's been wearing the Cayman's since he was able to walk and they are always our go to shoe. They run a little big, so we've found that going a size smaller works."
3,Crocs for less,We purchased these authentic crocs for my 7 year old son. They were a great price and exactly what is seen in stores for $[...] What a great deal!
5,Tried and true,We bought these for my daughter after having had such success with them for my son. She had a bit of an adjustment period (one kept falling off) but now walks in them like a pro. They take her from playground to pool without having to stop and change her shoes. My son is on his second pair and they are the only shoes he will wear all summer.
2,NOT DURABLE,These shoes are not durable at all. My son who is 2 only wore these for a few days before the black plastic piece that holds the strap on the back broke off. I could never get it back on right and eventually lost the piece. They are now completely broken and cannot be worn at all.
4,Cayman/Classic Croc for toddlers,My three year old son loves them. Very sturdy and easy for him to get on. A little pricey for a toddler shoe.
1,Disappointed!,"We order these for my son's birthday. They arrived on time on his birthday but they were obviously in Used condition. The bottom of the crocs were worn, and the alligator images on the sides were scratched off."
5,Great shoes; color not quite what you view,"These shoes are a staple for my daughter. As soon as she wears the soles down or out grows a pair we get a new one. But, the color I saw on the screen was much more muted than what we got, so if you aren't super particular about the color, or have bought the specific color before and know what you are in for, the online purchasing is perfect!"
4,Love the color,"Couldn't resist the low price. Got the ""Tomato"" color (orange) for my 2 yr old. Stands out from the other toddlers shoes at daycare so she'll never misplace them! I don't wear Crocs however I get them for my daughter (she has other styles and colors) because it protects her little toes, especially when playing outside."
5,I love Crocs,My son loves them. Fast delivery and in perfect condition. T he color was great to match his Mario Brothers clip on's. I would recomend this item to any one.
2,Crocs,"If you get the length you need, then they are way too wide - like boats and way too big for children to keep on their feet."
1,if zeros were allowable; worst customer services! scam alert!,"I ordered blue crocs for my child in a certain size. They sent me bright neon crocs, in a smaller size. Why? I don't know. I ask for an exchange or refund, and I have yet to receive any. This has been going on for months and it is yet to be resolved. I finally put a review to see if I can get a different outcome."
3,Amazon Messed Up Our Croc Order Twice!!,"I ordered the Navy size 11-12 for my son, and received a completely different style croc in the mail (Croc Crocband Clog). I went through the process of sending those back and reordered the navy a secone time. The second pair I received was the correct style, but the wrong color. While the item was labeled ""Navy"", it was a blue pair. After the hasstle of returning one pair already, I threw in the towel and just gave the blue ones to my kid. Usually Amazon gets the orders correct, but in this instance they completely screwed the pooch.The shoes are the classic croc that are tried and true and last just about forever. Cross your fingers when you order and hope you get the correct color."
2,Broke within a month,"My son had a pair of crocs last summer and wore them every day. They held up beautifully. So, I bought him a pair (same color and style) for this year and within a month the strap broke off. At $20, these shoes should stand up better than that. I don't know what happened to their quality, but these were a disappointment."
5,Our second pair of crocs.,"I love these shoes because they are so quick to put on and easy to clean. My son enjoys wearing them, so they must be comfortable too. In addition, the navy ones I picked aren't some outlandish color, so they go well with many of his things. We're extremely happy with them!"
5,Great arrival time,"The shoes were a fantastic price, they fit great, and arrived sooner than expected. Couldn't have asked for any better service."
1,Defective pair,The strap broke within 6 weeks of receiving the item. Our now 19 month old has another pair of Crocs (lego blocks) that she has worn more and those are still fine. Her previous pair she was able to wear until she outgrew with no problems.I am very frustrated I cannot return/exchange these when it seems I must have received a defective pair.
3,Great at first but then...,"I love that my 2 1/2 year old can easily put these shoes on herself quickly and easily. They are great for the summer heat, stomping in puddles AND they are adorable on. BUT she has recently (after about 2 months wear) been falling down in them (mainly when running but sometimes when walking too). Maybe they have gotten stretched out because of the material...? :("
5,Sooo comfy!,"I love the Crocs, they are so comfortable and fit perfect for my babies... easy to clean and they can put them on themselves.This particular pair I bough came fast and exactly as shown in the picture, prices is good, you could find them in a mall store with similar price, but if you have no time or can't find the color you need, buy them online."
5,Great for Toddlers,I got these for my daughter to easily slip on for swim lessons and when we were going in the back yard to play. She is 20 months and can get them on herself which is a big bonus. We got the pink ones and she never wants to take them off. They also dry very quickly if you have a child like mine who likes to jump in her pool with them on.
2,buckle broke within an hour,"I think I would have loved this shoe for my 3 year old, but the black buckle piece broke within an hour of her wearing it! She was just around the house and it popped off and the inside was broken. The color was cute though. Wish Amazon had not run out so I could have exchanged them. I had to take a refund instead. Probably why they were only $[...]when I bought them!"
5,Comfortable and perfect for toddlers,"My two year old loves these. She is in a size 6 and I ordered her the 6-7's and they are perfect. She can also wear them with socks. Considering she hates closed toe shoes, these ones passed the test!"
2,Crocs not the same,"I love my work crocs so I ordered this for my daily use, and all reviews said order smaller way to big !! So I usually wear a 81/2 to 9 in shoes (on the smaller side normally) so I ordered a 8 and wow they were way to small !! And even with my foot in them it felt too unstable. Not a great choice for me :("
2,Not for wide feet,We purchased these from an outlet store so perhaps they were not made properly. However I was informed that the color combination between the shoe and strap was the only difference so I am posting this review for Moms who have toddlers with wide feet. After one hour of wearing the shoes my son developed blisters on the side of both feet. We threw the shoes away. Will not buy another pair. Too bad since I liked the anti microbial aspect and breathability.
2,"Children, wear with caution!","I really don't want to sound like a naysayer, but I remember reading somewhere that, due to the soft nature of these shoes, then have gotten stuck in the edge of escalators. My children are older, so I didn't worry, but my family and I saw this happen to a young boy first hand. It was quite frightening, and I hate to think of what could have happened if my husband hadn't rushed over and pressed the emergency stop button on the escalator. If your child wears these, please take caution to keep his/her feet away from the sides of escalators."
4,Crocs Cayman,Everithing in fine in this shop.Thanks a lot for you help keep working youy guys arer making a very good job.LR
5,Fun croc!,"My son loves these crocs! He wears them all the time and they are easy on and off, In fact he have gotten over 5 months of use so far and they have made it from Spring to Fall...and still look great. The bright green color is cute on a little boy, and I highly recommend these shoes!"
5,Best summer shoe!,"My son wore these all summer. They're easy to put on. He's 3 and did not need any help. They're comfortable and durable. Considering he's worn them everyday, they're still in good shape. At the playground, he could get wet in the sprinklers and continue playing without needing to change shoes. Will buy him another pair for next summer too!"
4,just what I expected,"I ordered these shoes for my son when he outgrew the last pair of Crocs. He prefers these shoes over his others, though we insist that he wear sneakers for the support when he will be walking or running around a lot. For everyday wear, these are nice and cool and easy on his feet (we tried another pair of sandals and they gave him a HUGE blister.) I am just as satisfied with these as I have been with the (2) other pairs my son has had."
2,sizing chart confusing,"Maybe it is me, but I ordered shoes in what I thought were my daughters size and they came in the exact size of my son's, whose feet are two sizes bigger. I could have misordered but I was pretty careful about it. The sizing chart is confusing.I agree with the woman who says the shoes are too expensive for what they are. That is probably true for kids' shoes in general, though."
2,Blisters,I always buy my kids crocs before going to Disney every year. I have never had a problem before. They usually walk alot and stay comfy. This year my 8 year old got horrible blisters on the top of his feet where the shoe opening is. Needless to say he wore gym shoes the rest of the trip. Poor kid was very uncomfortable. I think it might be this style. My other two children wore different styles.
3,love the shoes not the color,"I ordered these crocs for my daughter in the chocolate brown. When we received them they were not the same color as shown. They were washed out looking. We love the shoes, just disappointed with the color representation."
4,My child's favorite,"My child loves the classic crocs. I've bought her various shoes from Crocs in the past, but the Cayman/ Classic Clog remains as her all time favorite style. I ordered the next size up (10-11m toddler/kid) when I noticed that current shoes were fitting little tight. We just received it and they are way too big on her. Although it is the next size up, there seem to be a huge size difference between 8-9m and 10-11m. Other than that, they are the same great product we are used to. We are keeping them for next summer."
2,Broke the first time she wore them!,The croc buttons were not snapped together tightly. She was heart broken but without the straps she can't keep them on her feet. I saved three of the buttons but no such luck on the first one that came off.
5,Toddling in Crocs,"I bought these for my granddaughter who just turned one and is just starting to walk. She is fascinated by the fuchsia color. Watching her toddle around in them was too cute! They are so much lighter than her other shoes and she never tried to take them off. She is always trying to get her other shoes off. I was afraid they might fall off as she was walking but they stayed on even when she sat down and when she got back up. She wears a size 4 shoe and I ordered a size 4-5 and they are just right for her. Even though the strap isn't tight to her foot they stay on. She has a little room to grow and is wearing them with socks right now, but when the weather gets warmer...no more socks. I'm going to get her some more colors and these will be her main footwear for the summer. Grammy is going to try to get some to match. She's still too young to be humiliated by that!"
2,Strap ripped during 3rd use,"I ordered these Croc shoes for my daughter in July, and she wore them 3 times and the strap ripped: Crocs Toddler/Little Kid Cayman Sandal,Black,12-13 M US Little KidShe wore the same pair of crocs nearly every day last year, and they made it through the entire school year. The new ones didn't make it through the 1st week of school. It's still September and time to go school shoe-shopping all over again. I am not too pleased."
1,Wrong size and color and model...,"Horrible customer service, unresponsive. I ordered purple and I got a Disney Cars model and on a different size. I wrote an e=mail and never received an answer from them. Thank god Crocs is a great company and I was able to exchange them on a Crocs concept store. I dont recommend this vendor"
1,This products isn't an original Crocs,"Hi, I ordered this pair of crocs shoes for my little boy, and I was very dissapointed, because I noticed that the name of Crocs on the bach side of the trap, was inverted in the right foot. I never saw an original crocs shoes with this kind of mistake, so I thought I was frauded."
1,CROC RIVETS,We own several pairs of the old Crocs type slingbacks which had rivets that held the strap in place. These rivets have broken in the past and we had ordered replacements (not free may I add). When I called today I was told that the new style Crocs have machine rivets and therefore the old style is no longer available. I find this to be extremely poor customer service.
2,Sizing is odd,I bought these crocs for my granddaughter and was very dissapointed that they were too big for her. The sizing is odd so I had to return them
5,The only shoe my son will wear!,"I have 4 kids and my younger two have sweaty feet. Crocs are one of the few shoes that will not get stinky from wearing. I throw them in the top of the dishwasher to wash and then re-shine with the Crocs butter buffer.They are the go-to shoe for my 9yo son and he wears them almost exclusively. We are in So. Cal. so he can wear them year round. We have tried the different styles and the classic is his favorite. I have stocked up on these when the Crocs outlet comes to town. He'll wear fun ankle socks with them when the weather is cooler.I have never had problems with straps breaking and we decorate them with home made ""Jibbitz"" made from 2 buttons sewn together and a fun item glued to the top button.Highly recommend and please do not base your view of Crocs by the knock-off versions sold all over.... the material is not the same and the Crocs comfort/quality only comes from a real genuine Crocs shoe."
2,"Not good for an active child, ok for quick visits to backyard.","Not a big fan of these shoes. After my three year old daughter fell numerous times while running in these shoes, we limit her use of them to quick trips to the pool or backyard. She is not allowed to run in them and doesn't like to wear them as they make her fall down. She has a narrow foot, and perhaps this attributes to that a bit. These shoes are very wide and loose. Probably more suited to a child with wide feet or a child that doesn't run and play (do they exist)? I will not be purchasing these again, as I have found the Keen Newport to be a much better, durable, safer shoe for my child to wear all summer."
3,Hefty price,"Don't get me wrong, my son loves them, and they are easy to rinse off or get wet. But they are just as expensive as mine."
2,too short too wide,"My son has been wearing crocs for years. He has worn the classic style. I thought this would just be the next size up. But the sizing seemed off. We ordered a boys size 2. The size 2 was about 1/4 inch longer than the size 1 that he had outgrown. But the width was 3/4 of an inch wider in the heel area, at least and equally wide or wider in the toe area. The size was described by Amazon as Medium or M. I looked up the same shoe on the crocs.com website and it was described as their ""roomiest"" or widest fit of the three fit styles they listed. So I think this shoe should be listed as a W or Wide not medium, especially since Crocs run wide anyway. I had my son put one old shoe on and one new shoe on and took a picture. I was hoping to be able to post the picture so that potential buyers could see how wide this shoe is. This shoe would probably fit a kid with short toes and very wide or chubby feet. I am returning them as they do not fit my child's average size 2 foot."
4,"Durable, comfortable, and convenient",We live in a wet climate so the yard is often squishy. These are great play shoes for here. It is also customary to take your shoes off upon entering houses so they are very convenient for that as well. The color is adorable and my daughter just loves them. The price was decent as well considering that the knockoffs cause horrible blisters on the insides of feet-these did not. All in all it was worth the purchase.
5,My 3 year old loves them!,These are very durable and last longer than the time it takes for my son to grow out of them. This is the 2nd pair that I have bought.
4,Great toddler shoes,"I love Crocs for both my boys at the beach, running through the sprinklers at the playground, and generally just playing in summer. However, why are they so darn WIDE! It works for one of my kids who has feet on the wide side. But my other child has very narrow feet and the Crocs almost fly off when he walks let alone run.Please Crocs, make a narrow version of your classics!"
1,Selling in garage sale,"While I had high hopes for these shoes, I cannot recommend them for little toddlers at least. My daughter, who is 2 1/2, stopped constantly to get out bits of grass, sand, and rocks that came in the holes around the sides. Not fun! However, I also bought some crocs with a crocband around this problem area, which are perfect and never do this, so I recommend buying some of those instead!"
4,Preferred shoe choice,"Easy on, easy off & they're waterproof!!! My daughters' preferred shoe choice (mine too!)"
4,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Seasonal Straight Shooting","Bha-dha-bing Bullseye ~ A quiver filled with the sharp contemporary seasonal Blues ,a good ideal of ""how to"" for a label com""YULE""ation. I really like how each release flies from a different sub-genera of the Blues, variety is good .The com""YULE""ation coodinator did the job with a fine shooting order, the movement between style,tempo,and spirit is with aim toward truth. The inclusion of six new tracks, yeah some are a ""new"" variation of familar seasonal hits so what, show the progression of originality Blue`s fans have come to expect.Take an arrow with tracks 1,2,3,4,8,9,and 10 , while 5,6,7,and 11 the point maybe slightly blunted. Post Script~ Real Good that could have been Real Great if the quiver held at least one more.Perhaps with the shaft of an instrumental,or additional tracks with more feminine angelic vocalization to aid in seasonal balance.***buyit*saveit*shareit*giveit*donateit***"
5,Loved the book,"I loved this book. Its a fantastic, philisophical love story set in a magical location. Clay Morgan paints a very evocative picture that ultimately speaks about religion, theology, and the worthlessness of thinking too much about life."
2,A Long Slog,"I'm afraid I don't share the opinion of most of the other reviewers. I found this book tedious, rambling and poorly organized. I am half Welsh and have visited the areas in the southeastern coalfields where my grandparents came from several times which happen to be featured often in this work. Indeed that background was the only thing that kept me reading. Perhaps a better title would be ""The Political History of the Southeastern Wales Coalfields"" because that is where he spends about 80% of his time. With chapters of sometimes 100 or more pages with no sub-titles gives a glimpse of just how hard it was to figure out where he was going with his discussions. You have to be a hard core Welshaholic to appreciate this one."
1,"Dreary,dry and dull","The title of this review may sound like a law firm but it is sadly the truth about this book.I did not buy this expecting a light ,easy read but Lordy! it is a chore [I gave up around two thirds of the way through,unwilling to be bored rigid any longer].As a textbook or source for a thesis or for someone who wanted to write an interesting book about Wales,it would be useful.If these are not your inentions give ita big miss."
3,citizen CD player,"I bought this in order to listen to recorded books. The sound is good but I was disappointed that when I turn the CD player off, it does NOT keep my place- the current page I am reading.Citizen CD160 Cd Player With Mp3 Playback And 120 Second Asp"
3,Windows XP Media Center Edition ONLY,Doesn't now work on Windows 7. Media Center does not recognize it. There are not drivers for it. May work with MythTV if you want do do all that work.
2,Raw,"Ever find yourself mesmerized by the soundtrack of an old western show? Well, maybe this cd is a little more sophistocated than that, but if you're expecting gorgeous ambient soundscapes as is on ""Desert Solitaire"", it's not to be found. This is really raw and gritty. I was unimpressed. I have played it only a couple of times since purchasing it."
2,not the best Roach music,"As a long-time steve roach fan this is not a cd that I would recomend, it sounds very typical of western music from a movie and sounds like an afterthought recording from Steve. I would rate this CD as among his worst among great recordings he has done in the past."
5,Takes the listener out to the old lonely West,"Imagine a soundtrack for the old West, not the John Wayne and Clint Eastwood cowboy west but the hard workin', lone desert where men and women worked hard in the hot sun. This is the mood that sets in as the listener follows the guitar twangs, harmonica slides and eerie ambient chords as the pieces carry the listener along the trail. It clearly combines the work of a skilled sound designer like Steve Roach who creates the wonderful ambient atmosphere and Roger King who stimulates the listener with the guitar slides and twangs. It's smooth, it's rough, its strange and it brings back what once was the lonely plains of the West."
4,Music from the Great American Desert,"Steve Roach has definitely done more adventurous work. But here he tackles a definite genre - fake western movie music. This genre may or may not have been invented by Duane Eddy & Link Wray; in any case, many others have tried their hands at it including Ikue Mori, Scenic, & Neil Young, ""Dust to Dust"" stands as evocative late nite music, drone that entertains but rarely disturbs, perhaps better heard unexpectedly on the radio than on one's own CD. The ambient sounds (rain & thunder) are either fitting or corny, depending on your mood. I've heard music much like this on PBS documentaries - ""The Farmer's Wife"" comes to mind. No new musical trails are broken. But there's room for all in The Great American Desert & time will tell if this Roach / King collaboration survives there."
5,Eastbay Men's Elite shorts,Great shorts for running. Very comfortable and refresh feeling.I can run extra miles compared to running in my old shorts.
3,Only Thing Van Damme Made Worth Mentioning,"Since the 90's Van Damme's career has gone from bad to worse. Because of his limited acting he joined the ranks of Stallone and Schwarzenneger as an action hero. After over a decade of making plotless films, Nowhere to Run is the only film Van Damme should list on his resume. For the first time fans could take him seriously and it was refreshing not seeing him in mid air balancing a plane on one foot and a horse on the other. This is a good, uncomplicated film for movie buffs, Van Damme fans especially. Though a lot of them won't appreciate the lack of superficial action. Van Damme finally did something right when he took part in this movie. Unfortunately he followed this film up with a long list of wrongs that killed his career."
2,Formulaic B movie,"In the 1940s and 1950s people flocked to see B westerns. Although it may not have been that way at the time they are now seen as mostly bad cinema with a few decent actors and plots found if you go through dozens of them.The action Movies of the 80s and 90s are now becoming viewed the same way as the B western. Underdog good guys vs powerful bad guy, marginal writing and acting, bad music, a formulaic plot that you can see a mile away......the only difference being a little more violence, cursing and nudity in these than the B western.This movie falls into that category. Some said this was Van Damme's best acting. Poor guy. Some decent action scenes give this the second star. Outside of that a way to spend a mindless 100 minutes."
5,"Nowhere to Run - Entertaining - ""Yes""","Loved this movie and loved Van Damme and Arquette in it. It was action packed,had romance,drama and seeing VanDamme more out of his action type movies was refreshing. I liked the storyline and all the actors in it. I'm a big Arquette fan and thought she looked great and her and VanDamme definitely have chemistry,I wasn't bored for a minute. I owned this first on vhs but will be purchasing it again now that it's on blu-ray!"
4,Good for its Genre,"This is an older movie, which I owned on VHS. I always liked Van Damme during the time he was at the top of his game (although he has more recently made some movies that are highly lacking). Although this is a bit dated, it's a good story and Van Damme delivers. Beware that there are a couple of nude scenes, so it's not for the young. If you want a classic drama/action feature, where the good guy has faults, but is inspired to do the right thing and prevails in the end, then this is a good choice."
3,Not bad at all !,"First of all, there are not many action scenes so if you expect a lot of fighting you will be disappointed. But it does have something that rarely appear in Van Damme's flick, a love scene and a good one with the lovely Rosanna Arquette. Also featured Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill from Silence of the lambs) as main bad guy. Basically it is a standard Van Damme action flick with extra bonus, Rosanna Arquette. The DVD is OK. Good picture quality and Dolby surround 2.0 is fine."
4,a two-time movie,"waht i mean by this is that when u watch this movie for the first time ur gonna think ""Wow,what a great movie""and thats true. i liked it a lot.but ur gonna watch it a second time and its not gonna be as fun,see?its a great movie,but not a whole lot of martial arts action in it at all.well anyway if ur a Van Damme fan,get it,but if not,skip it.(I like Van Damme movies but i got this one for free from a friend and im sorta glad i didn't spend 10 bucks on it)"
5,BEST DAMME MOVIE EVER!!!!!!,"This was such a well made movie and i don't understand why JCVD doesn't do more movies like this! They made JCVD more human than he was in films like Universal Soldier and Bloodsport because he was not the ""i will kick your ass any day"" guy. He was the ""i will kick your ass to protect this family"" guy. It also had an ending that the others didn't, but i won't spoil it for you. I love this movie, JCVD's best work!"
3,Larger than expected and a very thin coating of vinyl,I just didn't realize quite how large these were - I had purchased for a kitchen wall grid I have that I hang my pans on. The old white S hooks had yellowed after years and were just too disgusting to look at. My kitchen is red so I figured these would be great.The hooks are large and strong. Too big really for what I got them for. But the other problem is the vinyl coating is so thin that anything you hang them on will tear the coating and anything you hang on them will tear the coating. I used them down in the garage now and on the shower curtain rod to hang wet things like bras LOL. But the coating does wear off/tear where it meets the curtain rod.
5,Positive,"This album is simply wonderful. It's hard to believe Frankie Laine is 85, his voice sounds so warm and clear."
3,Some songs Mr. Laine should have omitted. Amazing for 86.,"There are three songs on the cd that Mr. Laine should have omitted because they seemed to be out of his range. By that I mean his voice required a more mellow tone. But given that he was 85 when he recoded the album, he is amazing. There are two songs that are very moving, both ballads: ""How Do You Keep The Music Playing,"" and ""Until Now."" Move over Tony Bennet. If you wouldn't know that Frankie Laine is 86, you have to say that you are listening to a very talented song stylist. I'm going to buy future albums by him, because it's so refreshing to hear decent music. No doubt, the legendary singer should keep singing. But he needs more new material..new songs. He could have a renaissance if radio stations would air this cd."
1,Nothing free here,"I just bought the 5 tray unit and you're to get a free composter fork tool. Well, you get nothing free because they add $4.95 extra on the shipping for it. I ordered this unit sans fork because I can't stand cheesy slimy marketing strategies. The composter looks alright so I'll comment more when I get it."
3,"Good for chicks, not chickens","I purchased this with the intention of keeping my chickens' scratch feed off the ground in the pen, for hygiene purposes to keep them healthy. Unfortunately it tips very easily and the grain ends up on the ground anyway! Best use for baby chicks..."
3,"Excellent Story, Horrible Writing","OK, this story was sweet but what in the world happened to the editing? I am sorry but when I have to pick up a pen and make grammatical corrections, I get ticked off. I was amazed at how great the story is but how poorly it was written. I strongly suggest use of an editor. An editor is the authors best friend when it comes to their writing. I am still not sure if I understand how this book was published without it being edited. For such a great story-I am sure the book will need to be edited before it goes any further. I suggest editing it right away!"
5,A Little Bit of Everything,"Strivers Row is a good, different story that encompasses a little bit of everything--family, frendships, romance, academics and nostaglia for those who want to return to those college days. Grandmother Mary was something else; she did somewhat redeem herself, but Aunt Phyl saved the day. Strivers Row is about setting goals, working hard, realizing your dream and reaching back to help others. Add this delightful debut novel to your reading collection."
3,The music,"I saw this movie in the theater years and years ago. I remember liking it, but mainly I still remember that song Rosanna. My mom came from somewhere near those parts and I asked her about it. I don't know if she ever met any of them. Her parents had a general store somewhere near the area. But she had heard of them, and maybe she told me she had seen them, but I don't remember. Anyway, I'd like to see that film again on DVD. But it probably won't show up on DVD. Too bad."
5,Start with gratitude and sharing,"This volume emphasizes the value of Gratitude and sharing as guides to living an extraordinary life. I like the audio- it's a fun gift to anyone whos' heading home for the holidays-- for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Kwanza or whatever holidary you are celebrating."
4,Magic Stuff,"Possibly not in the Top3 Cope albums(that would be Peggy Suicide,Saint Julian and World Shut your Mouth)but still quite a good record by one of England's top songwriters of the 80's,90's.First track 5o'clock World is a good opener ,containing one of Cope's best known lines ""I know a place where we can hide from the human race"".Vegetation is a cool sounding,smooth tune but Charlotte Anne is THE track on this album with Cope's voice at its prettiest making a compelling connection with Julian's usual instrument embelishments.My Nation Underground,the song,never struck me as brilliant but gels ok with the rest of the album.China Doll is yet another highlight with its sweet melody an enchanting pace.Someone like Me is faster and leads to the one track that still resounds the Teardrop Explodes'sound-Easter Everywhere.The pretty medieval tinged I'm not losing Sleep is followed by last track The Great White Hoax which ends the album in a nice way.A classic pop album worth checking out."
4,burning energy....just on fire,this is a really good audience recording...and i'm kind of a bootleg snob. the performance by iggy and crew is absolutely on fire...the energy is fantastic. iggy pop is the single most important person in rock'n roll history. die-hard Stooges fans DO NOT MISS OUT on this because I've heard its ALREADY OUT OF PRINT. Essential for the hardcores.
4,Mainly on the Plains is tops,"The episode ""Mainly on the Plains"" is one of the best in the series and most literate. Boris Karloff steals the show by playing a made scientist who while traveling with our intrepid heroes from Seville to Madrid, plays out episodes from Don Quixote. There are some East German bad guys, but who cares."
4,"good reading, puns and all","Christopher Ricks' enthusiam for Dylan and the English language mirrors Dylan's enthusiasm for his music. Other reviewers have complained about Ricks' punny style getting in the way of the reading. All it showed me was that he was having a good time writing about his subject. Reading the book brought me back to the Dylan songbook and I found myself wishing that Ricks had covered this song or that song along with the many ones he did analyze. If you don't know or don't care about a particular song, or find yourself getting bogged down, you can always skip the discussion of that one and start again somewhere else in the book. I found myself not agreeing with every one of his interpretations, but what the heck, isn't that what the interpretation of complex work is all about? I liked the book and am more likely to pick up a copy of ""Chronicles"", because of it."
2,Worked fine while it lasted... sort of,"This bag was okay, it did not fit my 14 inch Remo very well. The base of the drum had a hard time fitting, and the fitting of the bag around the bottom of the bowl was meant for a drum with a more shallow bowl(?) apparently.It never fit that well.And after about 6 months of minimal use both zippers broke off entirely.Get the case if your drum is 12-13"", 14 hardly worked."
4,Very nice bag but-----,Very well made bag. It is bigger than the dimensions state. I originally ordered a large size but the medium worked fine. The material & zippers are good quality. My only refinement would be to have adjustable straps. I find that it is difficult for me to carry properly. An outside zipper pocket would be nice also. But then the price would probably be much higher.
4,kept me awake across Manitoba and Sask,"I drove across Canada in the summer of '98. It was a great trip, but sometimes the driving got boring, I got sick of all the CDs I'd brought along, and there was no good music on the radio. However, CBC was everywhere, and generally kept me amused. Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour was the highlight. I thought it was hilarious, and I'm not even Canadian."
3,Another overlooked guitarist!,"The guitarist on this recoding is somewhat of a local legend where I grew up just outside of Philadelphia, PA. His tone, technique, and vibrato are all excellent. I was lucky enough to hear some of the studio tracks before they were ""watered down"" by the record company. Another example of how the industry stifles creative artists. Regardless, the recording is still quite good, but the group was never pushed by the label. I believe there were some problems with Polydor at the time also. Dean's voice is good too. If you are a budding guitarist you should give this one a listen."
5,Breakfast for the Mind,"I thought that this was an excellent movie and that much can be gained from it, though it doesn't align perfectly with Vonnegut's novel. I was pleasantly surprised with Bruce Willis's acting, I thought that he did very well at portraying such a complex and difficult character as Dwayne Hoover. I am glad in a way that it wasn't exactly like the book, I know others complain about that aspect of it. If you ask me, it would take away from the value of the book if the movie were made exactly in it's image. I liked the movie a lot, it is one of the better ones that I have seen. It is understandable how some people may not enjoy it, it's difficult to take it all in, but if you can, I think that you will find it to be rewarding."
2,"Great effort, bad movie","There was a lot of great talent on display in this movie - Bruce Willis did a great job with a nearly impossible character, and Omar Epps did well too. The technical aspects of the film were rather impressively done as well. Unfortunately, one has to wonder what the director's goal was. Movies are made to either entertain us or challenge us. This does neither. The only challenge was to keep watching it. I never read Kurt Vonnegut's book, and I shouldn't have to in order to like the film.... and well, I didn't. Maybe Vonnegut's story was good, but the story as presented in this movie is rambling and not worth the effort of trying to make sense of."
1,Be afraid!,"Fans of the novel upon which this movie is based be warned! This cloddish film shows none of the spunk or wit of Vonnegut's masterful work! Do yourself a favour and put the two hours you would have spent watching the film version ""Breakfast of Champions"" towards reading another Vonnegut book."
2,I'd Rather They Hadn't Tried To Make This A Moovy....,"...and no disrespect to Vonnegut, I don't think he writes novels that are easily adaptable to cinema. I had BIG trouble with the ""Slaughterhouse Five"" moovy. In this I found Albert Finney's Kilgore Trout the best thing about the moovy. He looks like someone who is as confused at the accolades as much as he is willing to get per diem from a bunch of middle class denizens whose major attribute is that they nearly know how to run a good stripmall. Barbra Hershey also does well as Duane's daffy wife.But, the other players? Children, repeat after me. O-VER-ACT-ING!Read the novel, skip this moovy."
3,Why all the hate?,I've read the book and seen the movie and i don't really understand all the hate for this movie. Is it as good as the book? It certainly is not but it's good for what it is and that's an oddball movie. If you enjoy weirder slices of cinema then i think you could very well enjoy this movie. If you are a Vonnegut nut looking for the best book to movie adaptation ever made then be sure to look elsewhere.....
4,Who said,"""Illiterates need not apply""? They were right on. No this movie will not completely mimic the book, however, I think it does an excellent job of capturing the unique essence that is Vonnegut, on film. If you are familiar with Vonnegut's body of work, you will appreciate this film, and might even wet yourself laughing.You either get it, or you don't."
1,unbeleivable,"i cant beleive i sat through it.i did because it stars two great actors]willis and nolty].but there not very great in this rubish.i couldnt even follow the story half the time.what a waste of tallent,how could they sink so low to appear in this so called movie.RUBISH.its going straight in the charity bag.at least the people that watch it next wont waste so much money."
2,It could have been better...,"I feel that the people who made this movie took far too much liberty. It is not enough like the book to really even carry the title, in my opinion. The book was rather sketchy, but in a way that made it enjoyable. While the eratic behavior of the actors portraying the characters in this movie, while typically very good actors, was quite obnoxious. And i say that as a fan of just about everyone in the movie."
2,Painful to Watch,"I like Vonnegut enough to have a desire to see this movie, after all the book was pretty good and one of my favorites by Vonnegut. This movie flat out stinks. Vonnegut's books just don't translate over to the Big Screen very well and this movie is no exception. I suggest you read the book, but pass on the movie - in fact avoid it all cost."
4,VERY FUNNY MOVIE,"...I THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS AND CLEVER. I DONT THINK IT IS THE FUNNIEST OR BEST MOVIE EVER MADE,BUT IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR 4 STARS."
1,Question,"Why do people who like stupid movies think that those who don't like the same movies must not be intelligent? (This sums up both most of these posts and ""Breakfast of Champions."")"
2,Retroactive collapse,"Vonnegut is one of my favorites, and ""Breakfast of Champions"" is my favorite of his works. I looked forward for weeks to the release of the film version, only to leave deflated.What's so disappointing about the adaptation is that it works for almost the entire running length of the movie. The surreal aspects are handled well and the absurdity of life put forth by the novel is completely present.The deal is, ""BOC"" literally climaxes on the last page with a scene in which main character Kilgore Trout meets his maker, to wit Vonnegut himself. This crucial and absurd scene could have been adapted only literally, but it wasn't. It was reinterpreted, showing Trout melting into a sort of Maxfield Parrish painting. Maybe Vonnegut couldn't be had for this scene, or maybe he wouldn't agree to have an actor portray him. Who knows. This mis-done sequence, though, because it was so crucial, tainted everything that had come before."
1,I Lost My Breakfast,"I don't even want to talk about it. I hope Nick Nolte got a fat paycheck for wearing that red negligee. Makes his infamous DUI mug shot look good. The one authentic scene is where Dwayne reads about ""himself"" in Trout's book. Everything else--and I mean everything--is just awful."
2,"Altman's ""Champions""?","I understand that Robert Altman had wanted, even prior to directing ""Nashville"", to film ""Breakfast of Champions"". Watching ""Nashville"", this longtime Vonnegut fan finds it easy to believe that it was created under the influence of Kurt. It's too bad Altman didn't get around to creating a formal adaptation; I think it also too bad that his protege Rudolph, in taking a crack at it, didn't achieve, doesn't seem to have aspired to the lightness of touch one sees in Altman's deft, curve-ball satire -- that one hears in Vonnegut's droll, imperturbable literary voice for that matter. So here's my recommendation: want to see a great adaptation of ""Breakfast of Champions""? Watch ""Nashville"" (wry, sprawling satire of middle-american, mid-seventies mores and morals), and use some imagination. Have fun!"
3,This movie proves...,"exactly how difficult it is to move written word to video. The novel contains many internal thoughts of the characters, which are almost impossible to represent in on video. Nevertheless, it was a decent movie. Thank god I read the novel beforehand, or I may not have had the slightest idea what was going on..."
2,"Not a bad effort, but...","Vonnegut's novels are eccentric and abstract, and they generally don't translate well to film. This one is no exception. The performances are good, but without Vonnegut's riffs the story seems empty, little more than weirdness on top of weirdness. There are a few comical moments, but this film will leave most Vonnegut fans dissapointed and non-Vonnegut fans confused."
2,Breakfast of B.S.,"I ordered this DVD through Amazon.com It took a month to get here. That's because the dealer lives in Hong Kong. The movie itself looks like a bootleg. Poor picture quality, scenes missing and Chinese sub titles that can't be turned off. I have done alot of business with Amazon and will continue to do so but I must say I was totally disappointed in this product. BTW To return this item to the dealer will cost you $13, almost the cost od the DVD itself. Buyer Beware!"
1,"Movie So Bad, The Reviews Were Removed!","I don't imagine this review will last long on this page. A review of mine, along with about four others, was removed, presumably to protect sales. The upshot of all of the reviews stated that this film is not worth the celluloid it was filmed on.If you are a Vonnegut fan, avoid this film. If you are not a Vonnegut fan, avoid this film."
4,silicone skin kit,"I loved everything in this kit except for the belt clip device.The belt clip device was kinda cheap and poorly designed.The worst part about it was,it wasn't even the belt clip that was shown in the picture.But for what the rest of the package would have costed to buy seperately I believe it was a good deal."
5,One of my favorite Patterson novels,"I could not put this book down! I love all of Patteron's books, and this novel was fastpaced and well written. I loved the story and the characters. I would highly recommend this book."
4,My first Patterson,"This was my first Patterson book that I've read, and I was definitely satisfied after reading it. Violets are Blue is filled with excitement, keeping me on the edge of my seat. Some of the book was predictable but still a book I would recommend to people."
4,Nasty But Good,"Alex Cross is back and in this novel he is taking on vampires. I know it sounds crazy but it yet again Patterson has produced another book that is very hard to put down. Cross as usual has many things going on. First is to stop the killings that are taking place in America. He is also have women problems, nothing out of the ordinary, in which he does not want another partner to meet their end at the hands of his rival, the Mastermind. Even though this book gets kind of vulgar in some spots it is hard to put it down and that is one theme that occurs throughout all of James Patterson's works."
4,Gore Galore,"Love Patterson's work, but this was a little on the wild side. Found it interesting as far as the wanttobe vampires and perused the net to find it to be somewhat true, of course mainly in California,where else? Once we got back to the mastermind it was more my line. Enjoyed it but have read better Alex Cross Novels. will look forward to more,I do not give up on a great writer."
3,Okay but not his best,The book is ok.. I waited for the library. It's entertaining but not so realistic..come on.. Vampires?? Anywayz.. I've read all of Patterson's books and my personal favorite is When The Wind Blows.. it's like a sci fi.. but a lot better than this one.
1,violets are blue,"Having read only one other of this author's books, I am by no means an expert: however, I just felt that other readers would like to know that this is just about the most inane and unbelievable book I've read in a very long time. Not only does the plot lack spirit and creativity, but the characters are ludicrous.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Enough Already,"First I want to say I have bought first editions of Pattersons books since ""93"".I actually rate this book less than one star. I got to page 47 before deciding it was a waste of my time.Wide margins and large print have been the norm for his last few books. This man is out of story ideas. His ""Suzannes's Diary"" was a crock.I feel that I have wasted my money on his last three publishings. I will not do so again."
2,Lackluster!...,and utterly boring. I can't believe this is a James Patterson novel featuring one of my fav fictional characters (Alex Cross). Both plots in this story were lacking and revelations were flat. I give it a generous two stars because I like Alex Cross. I'm glad I didn't purchase and got grom the library instead. I do not recommend.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE!,"I have read almost every one of James Patterson's books and really enjoyed the Alex Cross series. I was even okay with his really far off premises in some of the others (kid's with wings...was he kidding?!), but this one is really dragging. This entire vampire premise is way out there and the same BS keeps happening to Alex Cross. I can usually plow through his books in a weekend, and I have had this one on my nightstand for well over a month. I read only a few chapters at a clip. This means I am BORED! I am so disappointed with this one. Wait until it comes out in paperback so you won't have to pay as much or better yet, borrow it. Save your money on this one. Maybe his next book will be back up to par."
4,This was a great book.......,"I am a really big fan of Mr. Patterson. As a person who has read everyone of his books, this one was one of my favorite. His books keep me on the edge. And this book was no different. I simply loved it. I could not put it down, I read it in one day. It was great, one page after another. It keeps you wondering and on the edge of you seat. I did not know the Mastermind was after reading Roses are Red, so I was very edger to find out. I thought it was a crazy family or John Sampson(Alex's childhood friend), but the end proved me wrong. James Patterson is a great writer and his books are execllent. The bad thing is we have to wait to long to read another great book. And then some times he don't write a book about Alex. So its a while before we could read about him. He need to write a litter faster. Maybe write two books about Alex then write one about something else. This would keep his fans intersted and happy. I hate having to wait so long to read a great book."
5,Page Turning Thriller,"I made the mistake of reading Violets are Blue before reading Roses are Red. But no matter. I could not put this book down from page one. That is a rarity for me. The only problem is that every other Patterson book I've read since pales in comparison. I don't see how he can possibly top this book, but I'm sure he'll keep trying."
1,"Do NOT read this book, out of order","Do NOT read this book if you haven't read his earlier books. Not only are there lots of confusing references to his earlier books, but also lots of spoilers. Much of this book did not make sense. Also the 'sidekick' Sampson is always wasted in these books. It's like he's just waiting around to help Cross or console him and doesn't have much to do. Big disappointment compared to Spenser and Hawk (I recommend Robert Parker novels BY FAR over these.)"
3,A new look at Patterson,"I haven't read an Alex Cross adventure since Kiss the Girls. This definitely wasn't as good but, it did make me want to go back and re read all of the Alex Cross adventures that I missed.I wasn't lost, which is a good thing about Patterson's books. I don't have to read them in order if I don't want to. I did like this book, don't get me wrong, but the two cases in one sort of made me a little confused throughout the whole ordeal. With that said, I can still picture Morgan Freeman in every story!"
1,Not worthy of James Patterson,"I have read all of the Alex Cross novels except Roses are Red -- and I guessed almost immediately the identity of the Mastermind. This book was not worthy of the talent of Mr. Patterson. As I was reading the book, I kept wondering if someone else had written this book, like Mr. Patterson's teenaged child (if he has a teenaged child). Don't waste your time on this book -- and let's keep our fingers crossed that the style that we loved in Along Came A Spider comes back in the next James Patterson novel"
3,"Good Effort, but not his best work.","I am of the opinion that James Patterson should let the Alex Cross series end with one more book. When I first started reading the cross novels, I could not put them down, one after the other I read and enjoyed. Now I look forward to the Cross novels as a quick read that requires little thinking.It might be that I am growing tired of the same old story lines with hardly anything new showing up in the personal life of Alex Cross. Or maybe I just am starting to find it really hard to believe that this detective would not ever make a mistake. I really enjoyed 1st to Die and I think that it was because it was Patterson's same style but new and refreshing characters.All in all this was a fair book. Easy to read and fast. If you like the Alex Cross series you will like this book. But I think that it is time for Dr. Cross to retire."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on...,"I enjoyed some of Patterson's early Alex Cross novels. He was never up there with Sandford or Connelly but they were fun and quick reads. At some point I lost interest. I saw this one at a library sale for 25 cents and thought, ""How could I go wrong for 25 cents?"" Turns out I got ripped off. This book is ludicrous. It seems thrown together and coming off reading one of Connelly's best, it seems like a high school fiction project. Vampires?! Oh my God!!!"
3,like vanilla ice cream,"It's good, it's fun, you enjoy it, but it's never quite as good as you wish it were. James Patterson, as always, has come up with a good, fun mystery and lots of interesting characters. Although, hopefully the next time we see Alex Cross, he'll be on to something slightly less bizarre. I just wish Patterson could write a little better. Not that I require fine literature--I like a good beach read as much as the next person. But Patterson feels compelled to spell out what's happening right in front of our faces, and he's got major issues with putting every other sentence in italics (why hasn't his editor done something about that one?). So...like the vanilla, when I finsihed this book (like most of Patterson's) my reaction was ""yep, that was good,"" ...then promptly forgot about it and moved on to the next thing."
1,Violets Are Blue,I believe that the majority of this book was cut & pasted from his previous novels. It reads like an advertisement for all his prior works.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Been a fan for a long time, but I think this was the end for me. I cannot believe how bad this novel was. NO plot, characterizations were non-existant and what a waste of my lovely birthday and Christmas gift certificates. Will not purchase any more of his books, will wait and check them out of the library if I am curious about the next one."
3,predictable--but a decent escape for a plane ride...,"OK, so we already knew the identity of the Mastermind...but we do experience Alex Cross's crisis regarding his increasing dissatisfaction with his work / family balance. While many of us can identify with that, it is not why I read Patterson's books! The vampire storyline is poorly developed, and lacks the great Alex Cross analysis into the minds of the killers. I missed the keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller that we've experienced with other Cross story lines. No surprises, no waiting to see what unexpected turn you'll face in the next chapter. This is not anywhere close to Patterson's best effort, but it does provide a mindless escape for a few hours. I feel bad for any new readers who mistakenly pick up ""Violets"" first; this is definitely not the place to start with the Alex Cross series! Here's hoping Patterson can breathe new life into the next one, and bring back the intuitive detective we know & love!"
4,Great Read!,"The book Violets are Blue was a very good sequal to the book Roses are Red, but it was not Patterson's best work."
4,Who would've thought?,"Kyle Craig as the Mastermind??? I know very little about the vampireunderground, but I do know some Goth types. So much of this book istotally unbelievable, except Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer really livedand breathed. Enough said. I love the short chapters and fast pace-Ican get through the whole novel in a day on my Kindle. I love thecharacter of Alex Cross enough to want to read more about him, despitehis shortcomings. After all, aren't we just as human?"
3,Decent Read,"I'd consider myself a moderate fan of Patterson. His Alex Cross series has kept me reading him through the years and I recently re-read this book because it was the only one with me at the time. Sadly, it wasn't as awesome as I remember, but it's still a fun adventure."
5,violets are blue,"I am a very avid fan of James Patterson, especially his Alex Cross series. This one made me come back every free minute I had. Fantastic."
5,The strange side,Alex Cross finds himself being schooled about the stranger side of the dark side where people want to be and want to believe in vampires. An interesting departure from the mundane. A good twist and second thread going on as well with Alex being stalked by the master mind. Another good book in this series.
2,James Patterson is loosing his edge with Alex Cross,Most of Alex Cross stories are engaging and thoughtprovoking. But I cannot say the same for this one. The vampire trend lead nowhere and was more of blood than of substance. His new series with 3 friends seem to be more engaging and fulfilling. He had earlier erred by unmasking the Matermind in Roses are Red. Maybe it is time to retire Alex Cross. Alex Cross has lost his edge. Predictability is not where one wants one's favorite thriller author to go. But Alex Cross seems to be going there. It is time to infuse new blood into your writing.
4,Vampires......OOOOHHH,"If you like the gory James Patterson books then this is for you. I really liked this book, partly because I love the Alex Cross series. This book is all about humans that think they're vamps and are terrorizing the city. It was a great read. If you like the Alex Cross series then come and get it."
3,fairly good,"As his other books, this one was one you had to finish, now. But something about it wasn't quite as enjoyable."
3,3 1/2 Stars --Typical Patterson Entertainment!,"While not quite as good as Roses Are Red and Patterson's early Alex Cross books, Violets Are Blue kept me totally involved in this fun and exciting read. If you've read any of Patterson's books, you'll know that his books are not great literature and his characters are not particularly well-developed -- BUT they are very fast-paced, suspenseful, thrilling and filled with surprises. Violets Are Blue is no exception. It is pure escape reading, and if you're in the mood to escape, I think this book will more than satisfy this mood. Enjoy! I'm looking to forward reading Patterson's latest, Four Blind Mice."
1,HORRIBLE,This book was the worst one yet. Normallly I like Patterson's books. They are a nice diversion from every day life...but this one was BAD! The vampire story with the brothers is not interesting and Patterson keeps trying to build suspense about who the Mastermind is...even though he already revealed the answer in Roses are Red. Whatever.....Patterson should take more time and make the books a little less predictable.
1,Huge waste of time!,"Predictable and boring. I enjoy reading good thrillers and mysteries, but this was not one of them. What a waste of time. Patterson seems to be running out of original ideas. With so many good books out there don't waste your time with this."
2,A disappointment,"This book seems to have been hastily done, more or less, trading, if you will, on the success of ROSES ARE RED. At times, it seems to evidence a flavor of ""a bit too fantastic"" which detracts from the overall story. The solid plotting of JACK & JILL, and of KISS THE GIRLS is sadly lacking in this latest offering."
1,DISAPPOINTED----BIG TIME!!,"""ROSES ARE RED"" WAS MY 1ST JAMES PATTERSON NOVEL AND IT HOOKED ME! I WAITED SEVERAL YEARS FOR ""VIOLETS ARE BLUE"" (SEQUEL) TO COME OUT! I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS BOOK! WHAT WAS PATTERSON ON??? I READ THREE CHAPTERS AND THREW IT INTO THE GARBAGE WHERE IT BELONGED. I NOTICE HE DID NOT USE THIS TYPE OF STORYLINE IN FUTURE BOOKS. WHAT A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT THIS BOOK WAS! I EMAILED MR. PATTERSON AND TOLD HIM AS MUCH!"
3,Ho hum,The overall concept of the book is probably ok - but somewhere I just thought it took a detour and went to sleep for a while. Surprising end? Sort of but also a little dissapointing.
2,Violets are blue,I really enjoyed reading Roses are Red and was very excited to read Violets are Blue. I was so disappointed. Don't bother its a bore.
3,Good But Not Great,"I recently began reading the Alex Cross series in order and was loving every minute of it. All of the previous books were very good to excellent or outstanding - deep characters, strong plots, truly evil bad guys, tremendous thrills, twists and turns......in fact Roses Are Red was SO good I jumped directly into Violets are Blue.This one just did not at all come close to Patterson's prior Cross efforts. The basic plot was far-fetched to say the least. Beyond that, what had originally built relative to the Mastermind became more and more contrived as this book progressed. While still strong compared to many other novels, this was simply not what I had come to expect from Patterson/Cross."
2,Where is the story??,I am very disappointed with this latest novel of James Patterson. I have enjoyed his stories in the past but with this book I kept looking for the story. It was the same thing chapter after chapter. Not a page turner for me. I am very disappointed in this book. Will I buy the next one by this author? Maybe.
3,To: James P: Cross Was Off Form And So Were You,"I have devoured all the Alex Cross books, so, even though this book was OK in absolute terms, it was a terrible dissapointment coming from Patterson. Perhaps the fact that the novel lacked suspense was inevitable given that Patterson gave away the mastermind's identity at the end of Roses. That said, however, even apart from that there just wasn't nearly the same level of suspense as in the other Cross books. I actually could hav lived with Alex ending after Roses, but this book was so average that he better write another, because such a great character deserves to go out on a much higher note than this. Maybe Jamilla can become part of the club in the other Patterson series and then Alex can work with them to solve the next serial killings in SF."
1,A quick read...,"...Too quick, actually. I like a mystery where I can actually participate, as a reader, in crime-solving. I enjoy the challenge of attempting to figure out ""who done it"" before the protagonist does, but with this Alex Cross mystery, like its predecessor, Roses Are Red, Patterson drops a bomb on his readers at the novel's end, and once the dust has settled, leaves oner with little more than a shred of interest in the outcome."
1,Dude; get a fact checker.,"""Eating at a diner in Woodland Hills, just off the 5 freeway""?The 5 is nowhere near Woodland Hills. Try the 101. And stop making each chapter 6 pages long, and ending in a SHOCK. It reads like Nancy Drew."
4,Gripping,Thriller as good as it gets.Finally got his man now on to next book. Can it wait to read it.
2,Hmmm,"I am the type to rush out and buy James Patterson's books as soon as they are available but I wish I hadn't rushed for this one. I don't know if it was the vampire theme but this wasn't my favorite of the Alex Cross books. I just found myself being grossed out for much of the book. After Roses are Red, I was dying for the next one but this one didn't do it for me. But I won't stray, I will be waiting for the next book with anticipation. So it wasn't horrible but it wasn't his best either."
2,Very easy read,I have read most of the Alex Cross books. Nothing new or stimulating happing throughout the book the story line was terribly predictable.
4,Riveting!,"I had read James Patterson's 1st to Die (which was good, but sad) and then went on to other authors for a while. Then I saw the blurb/excerpt for Violets are Blue. The name Jamilla Hughes jumped out at me and I decided to be pick up the book to see if Alex Cross was indeed an African American detective. To my delight he was!(But not blatantly, it's written so that he could be any ethnicity)Due to the author's short chapters I find myself flying through the book. It's very good and I can't wait to finish it and go backwards to the beginning!! I recommend starting at the beginning to anyone.Good book~"
1,Disappointing,"I've read most of the Alex Cross series and each one has gotten worse and worse. This one starts out with a bang and is a real page-turner for the first half of the book, but peters out with a disappointing middle and abrupt ending. Very unsatisfyingThis is one of the few mysteries where I guessed the culprit which took a lot of the fun out of the book. It was an obvious choice but didn't really make sense.It's clear James Patterson doesn't think much of his readers. This is the last James Patterson book for me."
3,Mixed reviews---try these instead.....,"Okay, not everyone liked this rather atypical excursion in the Alex Cross series. While you wait for the next ones, try the fine books: Just Killing Time by D. VanArman, Cross-killer by M. Montecino, Valentine by Tom Savage, Killer by James PattINSON, and the works of Bayer, Diehl and D. Wiltse!"
1,Starting to Slip,"The last two Cross novels are a clear disappointment. While ""Roses Are Red"" seemed contrived and artificial at the end. ""Violets Are Blue"" is clearly a sequel that extends the absurdities of ""Roses..."". I hope Patterson reconnects with Cross and soon. A sequel to a bad book only makes it a worse book."
2,"Even With A Bad Story, Alex Cross Still Rules","Violets Are Blue is probably the poorest James Patterson mystery I have read. Yet, when all is said and done, he has a great character in Alex Cross. Cross is a fully realized character who has become familiar in many of Patterson's other novels.I feel that the shortcoming in Violets Are Blue is the effort to reuse previous ""bad guys"" again and again even when the faithful reader is pretty likely to know ""who done it."". In addition, Violets is fairly unbelieveable as stories go, as well as bloodly and gruesome.While I remain faithful to Alex Cross, I would like to see this character get some better attention in the future."
3,Alex Cross Formula works again,"Alex Cross is back. He meets beautiful women, spars verbally and mentally with master criminal/homicidal maniacs and chases down some of hte most violent murderers in the vampire killers. I like the series. I got what I expected: short chapters, fast paced action and good versus evil, but I have to wonder if the formula is not getting a bit ragged with time."
2,Patterson phoned this one in,"There was very little of the real suspense here that I've come to expect from Patterson's novels. It started off promisingly enough, but quickly deteriorated so that before I was 1/3 through the book, I felt as if he must have written it during the commercials of Survivor. The Mastermind is pretty easy to pinpoint -- Patterson is not subtle in his clues this time around. And really, Cross' women-and-dating dilemmas are getting stale. I recommend this only as a part of the Cross series, but it's disappointing on its own merit."
3,passable,"The author is at least back on track with his writing,after a real failure or two, but ""Violets are Blue""is below the standard for Patterson. Those who haveread his previous Cross novels will come away feelinghe has knocked this one out a little too quickly, andthat maybe he was just following his own formula,rather than developing new ground.This story is believeable only if you buy into theauthor's thesis that his hero Alex Cross is the best,brightest and hardest-working detective in the country,and that, furthermore, the criminals he searches for are,likewise, the absolute worst, most intelligent, butdemented, criminals in the country.It is a lot to expect readers to accept, but, of course,many do.But, despite being derivative of his own work, this is adecent-paced story that is entertaining and worth a read."
1,Don't buy this book,"Patterson used to be pretty good at writing an entertaining novel. No more. This is a silly book, feebly plotted, and full of gore instead of plot and character development. I finally gave up on it, about 3/4 of the way through, as the outcome no longer interested me.Gerry Connell"
3,Patterson Lessons Road Rage,"Patterson books are my first choice for driving, in order to save myself from road rage in turn i find myself staying in the car to finish the last chapter. Familiar with his work, I was surprised that I was listening to a vampire story, I thought that was saved only for Ann Rice. I did find the plot a little silly, but I like Alex Cross so much I could get into his head and try and figure out the story. I can tell you that the end twist makes the book totally worth while. I can see from the reviews that this book wasn't a favorite read; however, I find that all of the Patterson books and the narrators chosen are fantastic for a short or long car ride."
2,Going Downhill....,"Tom Clancy was a top novelist. His writing quality has gone decidedly downhill over the past few years. He probably believes ""If you write it, they will buy"". I see James Patterson going the same route. This was to be the sequel to Roses are Red and the pursuit of the mastermind. What it ended up being is a romp through vampire rituals and very little regarding the mastermind. While there may be ""vampires"" in modern day, the book simply didn't cut it for me. Too far out of the realm for my tastes."
2,Not up to par.,"After managing to finish Robin Cook's stupid book, ""Shock,"" I had hoped to find something much better. Didn't do it with ""Violets Are Blue."" I wish there was someone writing about something plausible. Even Cornwell's new book was less than expected.Don't buy a new copy of ""Violets Are Blue."" If you must read Patterson, get a used book, or get from someone who paid! Far-fetched, ridiculous, a quick read but violent and descriptive."
2,a disappointed Patterson fan,"i've read most of Patterson's books and I can't believe this one was even published -- I guess if you've got a history of bestsellers, anything goes. Seems like I heard that he has a contract to produce 3 or 4 books a year right now, and it shows with Violets are Blue. It's as though he was rushing to get a book out in a week or two. Who cares about content, believability, building suspense, character development -- just get it published so we can make some bucks! I've read first-time authors who did a much superior job - including Patterson himself."
1,Sick book...,"I thought I was a true James Patterson fan, but this was the worst book I have ever read. I will not read another one of his books. The violence was disturbing and there was absolutely no character development. Usually I can't put Patterson books down, but with this book, I STRUGGLED to finish it. Save your money."
1,Surprised that I was so disappointed,"I have read a great deal of Patterson's books and have always been more than satisfied. It didn't even seem like I was reading Patterson when I was reading this book. I met Mr. Patterson at a book signing in Scottsdale, AZ and found him to be a delightful, interesting man and I will continue to purchase his books even though I was completely dissatisfied with his lastest effort."
3,two tales in one.......not a good thing,"Violets Are Blue is almost two completely separate tales in one book. One involves gruesome murders where the blood has been drained from the victims. This series of gorey murders leads into the world of modern vampires. This is frightening and intriguing and draws the reader into the dark world of fact and fiction surrounding this cult-like existence. It is both fascinating and repelling at the same time. When the Mastermind, the bad guy from Roses Are Red, turns out to be involved, then it begins to feel like two separate stories that never quite seem to fit themselves together. This would have been far better had the Mastermind not been a part of this. That part feels forced. You never feel like ""Oh yeah, now I see who it was!"" more like ""Oh, him........well, I guess so.""It just kind of fizzles in the finale."
2,disappointed,"I have read all of James Patterson's books, and was anxiously awaiting his latest. I was very disappointed in the vampire story and found a lot of the sexual scenes unnecessary for such a talented writer. In the previous book, I already knew the identity of the Mastermind, so it was no big surprise in the this book when it was revealed. I hope he continues on with the Alex Cross stories, but I also hope he returns to his writing of old and not the style in this book."
3,somehow it works,Violets Are Blue is an unusual Alex Cross novel in that it involves the supernatural or it appears to. It is actually about two stories a group of vampire killers killing like vampires are supposed to do and the return of the mastermind. There is good transition and balancing of the two storylines which Patterson does not always do and somehow Patterson is able to make an outrageous premise work to some degree . As usual the romance elemnts are the weakest part of the novel. Patterson is unconvincing at writing romantic scenes.
3,Worth reading but not his best.,"It was strange to start a book knowing 'whodunnit' from the start...or at least who was responsible for the murders in Cross's previous case. It worked though and I found myself waiting for The Mastermind to make his move or Alex to work out who it was.I have to say I was probably more interested in that conclusion than the main (I think!) plot concerning numerous killings where victims had been drained of blood or bitten to death, which seemed a bit far-fetched.That said, I still enjoyed reading it."
3,An Alex Cross semi-sequel,"I must begin my comments by suggesting Alex Cross fans read Roses are Red prior to starting Violets are Blue. The ending scene in Roses are Red is the starting scene in Violets are Blue with one important change. It's a grabber!This story seems on the surface as surreal, a bit of the Dark Side when in reality it is an even running suspense story with a predictable ending, assuming that you read Roses are Red first. However, as good as it is it also at times becomes a bit repititous, whereas many thoughts and scenes are reworked and presented over and over, probably as filler content.This book is not one of James Pattersons best offerings, but it is miles ahead of many of his others including the one Alex Cross clunker London Bridges.If you are looking for a fast read and want to tie-up some ""loose ends"" then by all means read this book. It is though a once-read forgettable novel."
3,"Alex Cross Vs. the Mastermind, part 2","Patterson is one sick puppy!! Where did he ever get the idea for this book? Anyway, modern day vampires and their minions are certainly an interesting, if unusual, subject for a book of detecting. I must admit that, disturbing though the subject was, the crisp writing and fast-paced plot kept me reading on into the night. The final solution to the mastermind situation was somewhat less satisfying, sort of an afterthought to the whole concept of the work. The author seems to be just churning out these books at a fast pace, and not really thinking them through. Possibly too many best sellers engenders a contempt for the reader in the author's mind, and he figures they'll buy anything. Often that's too true, and we see the best seller list inhabited by mere remnants of talent from writers that were really excellent at the beginnings of their published careers, and now are just living on their reputations, and the gullibility of the reading public. How sad!"
3,Not my favorite Alex Cross Mystery....,I've read all of the Alex Cross series and usually love anything that James Patterson writes. But I almost put this book down a couple of times because of the DISTURBING vampire sequences.
3,Good follow up to Roses Are Red,"After the disappointment I felt in Roses Are Red, Patterson follows up with a much better conclusion to the Mastermind case. While chasing a unique band of killer ""vampires"", Alex Cross continues to be tormented by the Mastermind, whose identity was revealed in Roses Are Red.Patterson had masterfully put together a dual villain-hunt in Cat and Mouse, but doesn't quite get it together here. Regardless, the book still had a lot of action and suspense in true James Patterson fashion."
3,Lose the romantic interests!!!,"I love Patterson's work, especially the Alex Cross series, but I would have liked this book a whole lot better if we weren't introduced to the character of Jamilla Hughes. At the end of the last Cross book, Alex is devastated because someone he's been having an affair with was killed by The Mastermind, yet, within a very short period of time, we now have Alex introduced and having romantic feelings for another partner. Having said that, the crime writing was as good as ever, even if a bit over the top, but I don't think I could stand to hear Alex say ""I couldn't forgive myself if something happened to them"" one more time."
1,No No No,"Being an avid reader and a huge J.P fan I didn't like this book at all, just too weird for me. I didn't finish it so don't know how it ended, except to take a peek to check on the mastermind.The first of these two, which is Roses Are Red, was GREAT, Very Scary in a usual Patterson way. There was a bit to much gore in this book. I do think that together Gross and Patterson are a good team, I liked the beach house and kiss the girls, they were both excellent. I can't wait for their next collaboration."
1,Disapointing waste of time,"The first few Alex Cross novels were really quite good. But for some reason, beginning with Violets Are Blue the quality of the stories began to deteriorate, becoming worse and worse and worse and worse. The plot of Violets Are Blue is disjointed and full of holes, and the writing is juvenile. Please don't waste your time or money with this book or any subsequent Alex Cross novels. I purchased and read them all. The first six Alex Cross novels remain in my library. The others have been recycled."
5,excellent,Book was in excellent condition and arrived in a very timely manner. Very pleased with this purchase.
2,Inferior follow-up to Roses Are Red,"Violets Are Blue is not a horrible book by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I'd consider it good had it been written by anyone other than the modern master of suspense, James Patterson. I found Roses Are Red to be one of the best books in the Cross series, and was really anticipating the release of Violets Are Blue, and ended up rather disappointed. The ending is quite anti-climactic for those who have read Roses are Red. The whole vampire plot sounds good when you read it on the jacket, but turns out to make this a weak entry in a great series. The ending is anything but thrilling, making the reader miss the quality writing exhibited in Kiss the Girls. Hopefully, Patterson is not falling into the trap of sacrificing quality for quantity. With any luck, the next novel will find Alex Cross back in top form."
3,Patterson's Novels are Like Cheetos...,"...not particularly good for you, not really appealing to begin with, but damned hard to turn down if they're put in front of you. And you have to wash your hands when you're finished."
1,Just keep getting worse!!!,"I began reading James Patterson 2 years ago and quickly moved through all of the Alex Cross novels. Each one captivated me and was a joy to read. Now these novels are completely without depth and character development. This, coupled with the 2 page chapters, make me feel as though I am reading a children's book. Violet's are Blue was the worst yet (even though I didn't think it could get much worse than Roses are Red). After this book, I won't buy another James Patterson. Save yourself the $, skip this book."
2,My first and last James Patterson book.,"It's hard to believe that James Patterson is a best-selling author. This plot is ridiculous! I like vampire stories as much as the next reader, but as I was reading I couldn't stop thinking this one was a farce. Furthermore, this writing is second-rate. Maybe I was expecting too much from this mystery novel- things like being able to participate in the story, suspense, character development, a little bit of actual unease (as opposed to laughing at the thought of circus performers acting as vampires under the cover of night).On the other hand, as a writer, maybe I'm jealous that Mr. Patterson can successfully get away with such mediocrity."
4,"Can Alex defeat vampires?Maybe, maybe not read and find out","The sequel to Roses are Red, this one isn't as good. This doesn't mean it's not worth reading though.This one introduces the supernatural world to the serial killer genre. Vampires are in this one and Alex must stop them along with the killer from Roses are Red, The Mastermind.How can Alex defeat vampires you ask? Well maybe he doesn't. Maybe this is where he meets his match. You'll just have to buy this book, read it and find out."
2,One book too many,"James Patterson is an excellent writer, but sometimes, you have to know when to tell your publisher you don't have any great ideas to continue a popular series. This book features two intertwined stories - each competing to see which could be the most preposterous. First, we have the silly tale of a sub-culture of modern ""vampires"", who are killing at an alarming rate, sometimes with the help of a tiger that only they can command. This story alone made this a pretty sick book. Finally, Patterson attempts to bring some closure to some of the earlier Alex Cross books by disposing of the ""Mastermind"", who really killed many of the victims wrongly attributed to other mass murderers in the previous books. The identity of the ""Mastermind"" was very dissappointing, and even laughable. Forgive me, but I couldn't take this book seriously. Please Mr Patterson, do not tarnish your reputation by continuing to pump out unimaginative trash."
1,"Time to Quit, James","We found it difficult to believe that James Patterson, or his agents and publishers could even release such a poor mystery. If you like books about cannabalism, give it a try. If you want a creative effort you can learn from, spend your time on another author because James Patterson no longer cares enough to write a decent book."
1,Violets are Blue,"Sorry I wated my time reading this waste of paper. James Patterson is one of my fav's but this thing was dreary. It seems he just needed to write something that had Detective Cross and others still alive and well. The story line is like something from S. King. Not a Patterson ""good book""."
3,"Good story, poor prose style",This guy needs an editor. I can't imagine how he has becomeso popular. This is one case in which the movies are actuallybetter than the novel. This doesn't really speak well of thewriter.
4,Cross At His Best,"As the author of ""Born to make the Kill,""I know something about serial killers. One lived in my head for more than a year. In this sequel to ""Roses are Red,"" Patterson brings back the Mastermind to taunt Cross with his unveiled threats while Alex works a serial murder case with the usual, can't-figure-it-out-until-Patterson's-ready twists and turns. This one's a page turner. It keeps you guessing right up to the end. If you're an Alex Cross fan, I'd pick it up and even if you're not, pick it up anyway."
3,Merry Xmas alex Cross,It waw such a short book. I didn't realize I was buying a mini book. I thought it was going to be a novel.Perhaps I overlooked that in the description but That was my biggest disapointment.The story was good butway to short.
3,Good,good but not à fan of the vampire sex scenes. Too graphic. Otherwise good. Love James patter sons books s.
4,Excellent,"Great book. Alex cross is the best when it comes to investigations. I recommend this book, or audio cd to others to enjoy"
4,Read the Predecessor,"Well although original, and a connection to the great novel, Roses Are Red, this book lacks the... something that I find difficult to explain, but a good, and broad out look on the underworld of vampires. Which having studied myself, found to be correct, and not wildly outlandish, making for good writing, and good story telling, some things just seemed a little to weird and unbelievable."
4,My first Patterson book won't be my last.,"Having seen (and enjoyed) a couple of the movies based on books by James Patterson, I decided to finally take a shot at one of the books itself, starting first with Violets are Blue. Although not the highest rated of Patterson's efforts, I went through it quickly and thoroughly enjoyed it. This book grabs the reader early and does not let go, effectively weaving together two main storylines (a cross-country murder spree and the Mastermind's pursuit of Alex Cross). Clearly, however, the book is not for the feint of heart - the body count is substantial and the vampire murders are described in graphic detail. Delicate subject matter notwithstanding, Patterson kept me turning the pages."
1,Total Waste of Time and Money,"I have asked my library to never allow me to weaken and take out another James Patterson book. This was, by far, his worst. Overly written just to fill the pages. No plot, no characterization, nothing."
2,Tiresome and predictable,"After several books, Alex Cross, becomes increasingly tiresome, predictable, and preachy. Neither the aforementioned Cross, nor author Patterson, seems to have grown or matured in this series.Skip this one."
2,I'll give it a last try.....,"Well actually a couple more times since I believe JP deserves a couple more tries before I really drop him into a ""kill"" file. Violets are blue is not all that bad. But it greatly lacks of depth and this is a serious flaw in book writing. If you torn the page off right from around page 240 onwards, voila!!! you have 2 novels. One's about the vampire and one is about the payback with the so called Mastermind in which it is absolutely irrelevant. My opinion is, he could've just add a couple of pages more on Roses are Red and finish it off and start with clean sheet with whatever title he would like to put. Having it like now is just utter silly. But I really like the short chapter although some of it are just meaningless and looks like he's writing that chapter after a bad night or day"
1,Alex Cross Embarrassed,"This is the worst Alex Cross book ever, had to force myself to finish it. Cannot imagine what has gone wrong with James P. that he would stoop to this kind of drivel. Used to like his books but will never buy another one."
1,violets are blue,"what has happened to james patterson? his books used to be so interesting , we could not wait for a new one to come out. and when one does it is about tigers and vampires! i did not get past the first chapter . i am glad i did not buy this book !"
2,I was quite disappointed :(,"I have read almost if not all Alex Crosses Novels and perhaps ""violets are blue"" were just too high expectation for me. After reading ""Roses are Red"", I was left hangging and waiting when would Mr. Patterson write and have another book. After reading ""violets are blue"", I don't know if I enjoyed it or just simply, think, ""that was it?"" ...I hope the next book he writes which I'm hoping to have a good story line/plot, will bring me back to excitement in reading it."
4,Violets Are Blue,"Personally, I didn't favor Violets Are Blue as I did the other Alex Cross books... This one just had a little something that was missing. I tried reading it from a newcomer's point of view, and I didn't recall many descriptions that will help newcomers to be easily acquainted with Cross. The ending wasn't even surprising or thrilling as it should be... I gave this a four star because it was such an easy read and it was thrilling at many other points in the story. I recommend this to any Cross fans, but I have to say it certainly isn't Cross's best tale. I hope Patterson will ""kick it up a notch!"" with the next Alex Cross story..."
5,I HAD FORCE MYSELF TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!!!!!!,"Another Alex Cross novel. EXCITING, INTERESTING, CAPTIVATING!!! I read this book cover to cover in 3 evening sessions. I had to force myself to put it down each night at bedtime!!!!!"
3,3 stars is more than generous,"This book was fast-paced and had an interesting premise, but the writing was lacking. It was sloppy. Alex Cross is still a great character though; that never changes."
3,"Not great, but it could have been...","I've read every Patterson novel published thus far and I would rate this in a lower group that his top tier (Kiss the Girls, Along Came a Spider, Cat and Mouse, and Roses are Red). As with all of Patterson's novels, this is an exceptionally quick read with very short chapters. This is nice if you only have a few minutes to devote to the book and don't want to stop in the middle of a lengthy chapter. That being said, knowing who the Mastermind was throughout the book (from Roses are Red) ruined what could have been an absolute ""fall out of your chair"" surprise. Patterson could have ended Roses without giving the Mastermind's identity, not revealing him until Alex sees him outside Jamilla's apartment...now that would have been outstanding! Violets are Blue is still face-paced and I enjoyed being bounced around as vampires appeared and then vanished, leaving death and mayhem in their wake."
1,vampires? puh-LEEZE...,"i love the alex cross novels, but this one was just plain goofy. he shouldn't have written it; it reads like a 'trashy novel'. his serial killer books are fascinating..and best of all, they're realistic. that's a large part of what makes them scary. this is not scary, it's ridiculous. don't waste your time."
1,Patterson Mails One In - Without Sufficient Postage,"If you're a fan of James Patterson ( or of his primary character, Alex Cross ) be kind to yourself and avoid this poorly plotted, developed, and -sadly - written addition to the ouvre. It reads as if Patterson owed the publishers a book, and wrote this one as quickly and uninterestedly as possible. If you're new to the Alex Cross novels, don't let this one put you off the entire collection. The others are much, much better. Sorry that the writer saw fit to let this meandering. not-quite-stream-of-consciousness see the light of publishing day."
2,Far too much Gore,"The Dragon Slayer becomes a Vampire Slayer??? That is what ""Violets are Blue"" is about.The graphic murder detail in the first half of the story was too much. Frankly, I made it through the first half only because of the cliff hanger of the previous book, ""Roses are Red."" I wish I had skipped the first half of this book to get to the really good writing at the end.Unfortunately, to wrap up ""Roses are Red,"" you must read ""Violets are Blue."""
4,Violets are Blue - I thought it was about Vampires... Was I suprised.,"Another great book by James Patterson. Starts the suspense immediately, and you really get to know the characters. THought it was going to be a book on Vampires, but turned into a book about the Master Mind as well. James Patterson does it in less pages than most, which is great. Many twists, and just when you think you figured it out, another change in direction. Keeps you in suspense till the very end."
2,Not the worst book I have ever read - but close,"This book will be very disapointing to Alex Cross fans. I can still remember how impressed I was with the ealier books - and that makes this one even more disappointing. I felt like James Patterson was actually trying to write this book so that it could easily be adapted for the ""big screen""."
1,"Bad , Bad, Bad","Chapters of only 3-4 partial pages, large type, generous line spacing, as though he was paid by the page or chapter. Poor characterization, repulsive sexual content. The main characters were just poorly written, and Alex Cross is getting very dull and insubstantial. I used to like Mr. Patterson, but I will not be buying any more of his books. I was barely able to finish it and had to resist throwing it across the room several times."
2,So So,"This was not one of James Patterson's best. The vampire story was lame and there was not enough of the Mastermind. Of course, if you read Roses are Red, there was no suspense about the indentity of the Mastermind. More of the Mastermind and less of the vampires would have been better."
3,Convulated Story?,"I normally cannot put down one of James Patterson's books. I even like Suzanne's Diaries for Nicholas. However, I was for the first time disappointed in this story. The plot was alot to swallow and the usual research he does is seriously missing here.It left me wondering if I still wanted to continue following Dr Alex Cross. I love all the characters associated with these books however in this one is Alex Cross getting tired with the whole process? Seems to me he is."
2,"Vampires? Oh, no....","While this may not be James Patterson's worst novel, it is not his best either. I just can't accept the premise that there are vampire cults or cells across the country and that these weirdos actually kill people to drink their blood. I could accept it in Bram Stoker and Anne Rice, who wrote romances, what ifs, in artistic fashion. I was able to suspend my disbelief mechanism for them, but not for this book.Another serious problem is the re-introduction of the downright silly villain, ""The Mastermind"" from ""Roses Are Red."" It felt as if Patterson couldn't deal with the blood suckers any longer and still had pages to fill, so he tossed in a second plot that wasn't really connected.In the rush to get books out, perhaps the writer is not thinking these plots through. Or maybe the editors just aren't paying much attention in their drive to get another best seller."
3,creepier IS better,"There are no great suprises in this typical outing from James Patterson. Once again it is a very fast paced, page turning thriller with all the pathos we have come to expect from the Alex Cross books. The one aspect of this book that made it stand out was the creepiness with the vampire killers. This brought back echoes of Along Came A Spider and gave this book a little more atmosphere than the previous couple of Cross books and is an element Mr. Patterson should employ more frequently"
2,Couldn't finish it,"Ok-I love and have read probably all of his books. I love his style-short chapters, fast moving, insights into the killers! But vampires? Nope, gave me the willies and I didn't want to read it for fear of bad dreams! Seriously! I can read killings with no problem, but there was something about the whole vampire aspect, ""drinking and feeding"" that was too much for me! I am sorry I could not finish it-I am sure it was great if you can handle that type of thing!"
3,Predictable and Boring,"I love the Alex Cross series, I read all the first books in like two weeks straight! This one was a little harder to get into and it flowed really slowly. It was also difficuly not to imagine that Alex Cross was being played by Morgan Freeman! I wish they hadn't made a movie of the series so soon. I wish Alex's kids had more of an intergral part of the stories, bit that might not be a good move.I was a little disappinted in the truth telling about the 'Mastermind', but I guess it helps with solving the current stoies. It was pretty predictablble about the identity of the Mastermind, but that made the story go a lot quicker. I liked the novel, and I didn't like it. It was a little too easy to read and not challenging enough."
2,"Violets are blue, and so is the book","Very disappointing. Story is weak, actually both stories that are going on in this book are. In past books you can't put it down and you read every word, this book you can put it down and you end up skimming some sections.It seems to happen with a lot of writers, including James Patterson, they start pumping out the books faster and faster and the quality goes way down.wait for the paperback."
2,Not his best,"His faithful readers already knew who the murderer was from his last novel-""Roses Are Red."" The book is not totally logical. As a reader who knows who the mastermind is, I was trying to tie the plot together, trying to make some sense as to who did what and why and how. The whole story is not as believable as his other books. The book left me feeling a little unsatisfied and disappointed. It might be a more enjoyable book for someone that has not read ""Roses Are Red."""
1,YOU PEOPLE MAKE ME SICK,I see when you get a lot of bad reviews for a real stinker like Violets are Blue then the reviews are suddenly UNAVAILABLE. You think thats going to help your business? NOTThats one of the worst books you ever sold and you should be ashamed for even carrying it.Poor Alex Cross.......
3,"Alex Cross is back, again facing his most deadly opponent.","Dr. Alex Cross is once again facing his arch-nemesis the Mastermind (who previously appeared in ""Roses Are Red""). As if that weren't enough to keep the detective busy, he's also trying to solve a nationwide series of ""vampire murders"" -- grisly killings that leave their victims mutilated and drained of blood.The vampire case is definitely more interesting than the one involving the Mastermind. I didn't care for that villain in ""Roses Are Red"" and he's no more interesting this time out. The vampire murders, though, are creepy and interesting, even if the vampires themselves are not.""Violets Are Blue"" makes for a generally tense and enjoyable read."
5,Read It In One Day,No im not bragging im just saying thats how great the book was. Alex Cross is obviously back and is now having to deal with not only the mastermind but also vampire cults. This was definetely the sickest Alex Cross ever. Very gross yet still in control of the story and extremely entertaining. Some may find it predictable i myself can't predict the ending to books so i think there were a few twists.When the vampire murders are finally solved is where the book really picks up. the mastermind is being even more clever but let me go ahead and get this off my chest and i will go ahead and say sorry for the caps but....THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHO THE MASTERMIND IS BY SIMPLY SITTING IN A CAR AND THINKING. IM SORRY PATTERSON THAT IS INDEED IMPOSSIBLE AND HONESTLY QUITE DUMB AND IMMATURE ON YOUR PART.That felt good. Overall this was a very entertaning book you may find it predictable and you may not. I enjoyed it and feel it is another solid entry into the cross series.
4,Handwriting On The Wall,"Looks like we are in for a series. The poem: Roses are red, Violets are blue, Sugar is sweet, And so are you. The first two verses are books. Looks like 2 more books before we find out the entire story. Sugar is sweet looks like it can play on what Sampson calls Alex Cross- ""Sugar"". Anyway, look forward to seeing how this plays out."
4,not as heartbreakingly suprising as roses are red,i loved this one. it was definatly one of the best. But at the end of roses are red was just heart stopping. I should've seen it but in the same way i couldnt. i love the way how you got to know other characters beside alex cross.
4,Great Book,"Violets are Blue by James Patterson is a captivating suspense novel. Once I started this book I could not put it down.This book is the sequel to Roses are Red. The main character Alex Cross is a Washington D.C. police detective. He has two murder cases to solve. The first set of killers leave their victims' bodies drained of blood and strange teeth marks on them. To solve this mystery detective Cross explores the secret world of modern vampire fetishes and role playing. The second case is much more personal. The Mastermind is still tormenting Alex Cross. His ex-girlfriend has been murdered and the lives of his family threatened. He must find the identity of the Mastermind before he kills again.I loved this book. Anyone who is a fan of James Patterson will enjoy reading this. It was smooth, fast paced and well written. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good mystery."
5,violets are blue,order came in better condition than i thought it would. very happy with seller and would recommend to anyone
3,I was disappointed!,"I am a new reader of this author, but I am reading Patterson pretty fast. I am a big fan of the Women's Murder Club books. My first Alex Cross was Violets are Blue. Wow...was I disappointed! It seemed to be disjointed, unfocused even. Murder after murder...and the police response was always to meet and talk (heck!he even bought doughnuts in this one!!)..no real police work like Lt. Lindsey Boxer would do. A new lead in the case didn't produce redoubled efforts or gearing up, more likely a trip home to DC for Alex. I didn't find the name Nana Mama at all believable. I guess I should reiterate that I am a fan. I just think this one was largely filler and fluff. Did I miss something? I thought you could read these in any order. Perhaps I would have been liked it more if this hadn't been the first Alex Cross for me? Ah, well. The 5th Horseman should put the world to rights."
2,silly and exploitive,"My title says it all. The Louisiana ""scene"" is, as is usual in novels, quite wrong. Detective Cross is a favorite of mine so let's hope he will have a better forum for his talents in the future."
2,Heart Burn,"Among the three reviews I had read, James Patterson is considered a talented writer. Using a style not often seen within long novels. Patterson uses small chapters barely seven pages long at the most. Designed to keep the reader reading without being bogged down by a never-ending chapter. These shorter chapters also afford Patterson the freedom to change time lapses and scenes often, without confusing the audience.Unfortunately in my opinion that was about the only clever decision Patterson made in writing this novel....I found that the book could in fact be consumed very quickly. Actually the book had only taken a day to ""consumer"". And like most fast food it left me with heartburn.While reading, the audience discovers more about the ""vampire brothers"" then they do about Cross's character. Even though the majority of the story follows Cross around as he discovers more murder scenes, goes on a bad date and tries to make amends with his children for being a workaholic."
2,Vampires?,"I am a big fan of James Patterson. That said, this novel was disappointing.The greatness of his stories is that there is something believable about them. However, the entire vampire thing in this book was dumb.The Mastermind, and the Kyle Craig twist from Roses are Red (a much better book) was essentially destroyed by this book.Would recommend his earlier work. Or something else entirely. An easy read...but not a good one. Unfulfilling."
2,Predictable,"Because I don't have the time to read, I pickup a audio CD from the library. Although I did listen to the entire thing, I can;t say that I enjoyed it. The storyline was so predictible. Hopefully his next one will be better."
2,A little bizarre...........,"I am a huge fan of James Patterson but his latest effort was a bit on the bizarre side. I was tempted to put the book down after the vampires came out of Golden Gate Park, but for some reason I decided to keep going, I almost regretted it. The intertwining of The Matermind and the freak of nature vampire children was very far fetched. Now, Patterson has left it that Cross is finally retiring, I wonder if in the next novel he will come out of retirement to find that Kyle Craig is still alive and stalking him........."
1,"A Weak Effort, Almost Ludicrous","This is perhaps the worst of the Patterson books,and that's saying something!! The writing issimplistic, the two young villains are totallyunbelievable, as is the Mastermind. There is alsofar too much hand wringing on the part of Alex Cross.I thought that the identity of the Mastermind wasrevealed in an earlier book, Roses Are Red and sureenough, it was.Patterson has got to spend more time on writing, vs.promotion."
5,A GREAT SLEEPER ANIME.,"If you like chases, big boobs, goofy charactors, and mature themes. This is the anime for you. Not recomended for minors"
5,Adidas shoes,"These shoes are so comfortable, with plenty of arch support for my high arches. I bought my first pair as a freshman in college, and they lasted for 7 years. Now I'm on my second pair!!"
2,Doesn't fit,"This product didn't fit my foot, and the material was too plastic. It was not comfortable. I have medium-wide width feet, and usually Women's size 9 fits. Not this time. I returned these shoes and got a Men's Adidas slide sandal."
2,Not what I thought,"I wear addidas sandals and when I ordered this pair it was too small. Also, I ordered the all white pair, and the white was not all white. It almost looked like it was eggshell colored. I wasn't happy with this order and returned them for a full refund."
5,one of the funniest books that i have read all year,"THIS IS SUCH A GREAT BOOK, I LAUGHED OUT LOUD WHEN I READ IT. THIS WILL MAKE ANYONE SMILE, AN EASY FUN READ NO MATTER WHAT STATE YOUR RElATIONSHIP IS IN. GREAT FUN! I CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER BOOK FROM SUZE, I THINK SHE IS GOING TO BE BIG."
2,"Good Concept, Poor Execution, Excellent Illustrations!","My familiarity with Beth Adams' (the illustrator) work drew me to John Doe. The problem is that there is too little work from Beth Adams and too much from Suzanne Yalof. The book, while offering a few funny moments here and there, was fairly boring...but it's brevity allows you to see the light at the end of the tunnel...a better book next time."
1,Not ready for Prime Time...,"Oh no! Another ""Girl meets guy, gets dumped and stays obsessed book"". If you are looking for either humour or relationship advise, keep moving."
5,I Love This Book!,"This book has helped me much more than any one ever has. If you have ever been dumped by someone that you thought was the ""one,"" this book is definatley for you to read. Two years ago, I broke up with a person that meant more to me than any one ever has and it was the hardest thing that i ever had to do. But when i picked up this book one day at a local bookestore, it impacted my life in the most positive way. I learned that i had to grow from this experience instead of wallowing in my own self pity. Thank you Suzanne for writing such a fabulous book!"
1,Not What I Expected--Shallow,"This book will be of no use when dealing with the break-up of a serious relationship. One of the suggestions is to go shopping. Great, not only will I still have a broken heart, but I'll be up to my eyeballs in credit card debt too. This book is only good for a few laughs when dealing with the break-up of a short and superficial romance."
3,"Funny (sort of), Helpful (yeah), Corny (Definitly)","I picked up Getting Over John Doe for two reasons. First, I have been ""getting over"" a guy for about six months without much success. Second, I needed a laugh (badly). WRT the first item, it was helpful (although I would never go out and buy expensive shoes on his behalf). More to the point, the book made me see that I have been dwelling on this guy for way too long. A must read for all those who have been dumped. Unfortunately, if you're looking for a laugh, this book doesn't do a very good job providing it. It has its moments, but they're overshaddowed by the long lags between them."
3,"cute, but...",The book wasn't as long or helpful as i hoped. Not worth the ten dollars on my ereader but it was a cute and uplifting read.
4,intriguing,"It is very interesting to read. It makes you obsessed while looking at any ad in order to discover if it has embeds or not. I don't know if these tricks can increase your sales or not. I have to try it first. But for sure, it can work for propaganda especially if the designer is a sharp artist in including embeds."
4,Another fun addition,"Another fast paced adventure in this series. The same characters are seen, and Henry's life on Earth is still just as confused. At the opening of the novel he is trying to convince himself that the Fairie Realm is his reation to stress and that he created it all in his mind. Of course he and the reader get to be really confused as he is abducted by aliens and later transported a la Star Trek into the Fairy Realm.The love Henry and Blue feel for each other is exploited in this and Blue is having a hard time dealing with the pressures of being the Ruler.While these books are about fairies and magic they have alot more of a tomboyish bent to them than a girly froofy fairy tale. Some very fun scenes happen and clearly this is not the last book in the series."
4,fairy realm books,"My favorite books are fantasy and while I may not put this right next to the dragon lance series, I thoroughly enjoyed the set."
2,Not at all what I was expecting,"I must say I was disappointed when I got this and the compiler it included is an Introductory Compiler. Whenever you compile any program it pops up a nice little window that informs you that your license agreement does not allow you to redistribute your programs. This bothers me somewhat because when I develop programs I like to compile and test each new bit of code that I add. The book on the other hand dives right in and if you have no programming background then you will feel like you are drowning in information. However, the author does do an adequate job of explaining what he is trying to teach."
5,SWEET book,"Before i got this book, i had NO programming knowledge at all and it sure is easy to understand for me!"
3,Exploring Spanish,It is a good resource for the classroom. I would recommend this book to Spanish teachers of middle school. Very good.
3,TOO BASIC.,I belive that the information is too basic. The only time it would be of need is that if you were going to Spain for a week. Not school material. Why? It teaches you nothing but of the rudamental facts. In other words... KEEP TRYING!!!
1,Stuffy and eggheaded.,"Both the characters and the narrator feel like they have the same blase personality, like some extra from a 1950's movie. And it's as if the author thinks nobody has ever heard of time travel, tediously explaining basic concepts. I don't want to be a jerk when this is probably his passion project, but serious sci fi fans should stay away."
5,Great Find!!,I love this book!! So glad I found it! It is very well written. I found it to be mysterious and exciting. I had a hard time putting it down. It grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go 'til the end. Definitely my kind of story. Looking forward to seeing what Mr. Cottrell comes up with next.
2,Very predictable,"I found the story to be so predictable that there was no pleasure of discovery within the pages. I knew what was going to happen almost as soon as a character was introduced.If you like to be led by the nose when you read, then this one is for you. If you prefer to be surprised and left wondering, then pass this one by. While I found the writing to be fair, the story lacked substance. I did finish the book, but I had to force myself to continue reading and when I finished I was unsatisfied."
2,I dont' care for the writing style,"This story was not quite what I expected. First of all the reader does not get to experience time travel at all; the story is told from the perspective of characters who are witnessing the effects of travel. Also, the main characters are intellectuals and therefore speak and think very differently than your average reader. Their conversations, for example, felt scripted and artificial rather than being a natural exchange."
4,Interesting Plot Twists,"The Time Ship is probably the 50th book I have read about time travel, and this one had a lot of surprises and plot twists. Even though this is an older book, and the plot moves more slowly than modern books, it keeps your attention. And the author saved a surprise to make an interesting ending!"
3,Still worth the Sunrise,"There are not too many good ones on this one.. BUT. BUT BUT BUT-You NEED SUNRISE. Just like De La Soul sampled 'I can't go for that' -Hall & Oats - with much success-- so does Red on Sunrise. Such a great song. It is so amazing.Red also covers Bob Dylan on this one and it is really good.With the exception of 'Pocket Book'--Like all Simply Red albums-- I am totaly blown away by one or two songs. Antother one or two are pretty good-- one or two are very ok, and the rest are kinda tired (like old red himself)."
4,Simply Wonderful,"I heard ""Sunrise"" on the radio about 3 weeks ago and was shocked to hear that it was Simply Red! I bought the ""Home"" cd the very next day and I haven't been able to stop playing it. This is my first Simply Red cd but it won't be my last"
5,The BEST CD I've bought in years,"It all started when I heard sunrise on the radio-I had to find out who was sampling Hall and Oates. Once I did, I got on the CDNOW website to check out the other tunes...I WAS HOOKED!!! This album has some REAL music here. I've always enjoyed Simply Red, but this album is Simply AWESOME. ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" is absolutely wonderful. Too bad new pop music can't have the same emotion. Sunrise is the most respectable ""sample"" tune I've ever heard. Congratulations, Simply Red, you have a sure hit with me."
5,they're back!!,"simply red? oh,that's the band from the 80's! well,think again. after a few dissapointing albums, that were at best background music for major shopping malls , simply red produced an album that is worthy to have the bands name on the cover . i was hoping that this would happen , well , it did !!! a must buy for every simply red fan , and for people who still have that english band from the 80's , with the red headed frontman , on their mind . LOVE IT , MODERN SOUL AT IT""S BEST!!"
3,Somewhat Weak,"Ok, I gave it a 3 and it hurt to do it. I love Mick Hucknall, and I was so excited when this CD was released because like all Red fans, I had been hoping for something new. I love the title track and Sunrise is special, but much of the rest is just not up to the incredible standards set in the past. I want more original tunes from this guy. The clever insite shown in his lyrics from past outings just wasn't there. I could never give a Red album less than a 3, but I was let down."
5,No place like HOME,"Absolutely awesome. I bought the CD a few months before it was even released in the states and I can't stop listening to it. I just can't imagine why Mick & Band haven't had as much success here as they have in Europe, but it's a shame. Hucknall is a master of songwriting, has a brilliant voice and deserves a great deal more attention. (Yes, there are quite a few covers on this album, but they still have a very unique flavor!) Every track on ""Home"" is gorgeous and the variety of songs is perfect. ""Sunrise"" is definitely a favorite, as is ""Fake."" I was a little surprised to hear ""You Make Me Feel Brand New""-but Mick pulled it off charmingly. A definite must for any SR fan or any nostalgic soul who hasn't listened in for a while."
2,sunrise...,"I live in Holland and the only two songs played on the radio here were 'Sunrise' and 'you make me feel brand new'.I loved and still love sunrise, but I considered 'you make me feel brand new' a pretty dull song.A week ago I bought this cd second hand for 2.5 euro and after listening to it for a few times I found you make me feel brand new to be one of the better songs. So actually the only song worth listening to is Sunrise, giving the album 2 stars, since the rest of the songs are below mediocre to very bad."
2,Not the Best Release from Simply Red,"While this CD was okay, it was more restrained than earlier Simply Red releases and I was disappointed with the content. Maybe it's because they're aging. Many other musicians have fallen short of their earlier works with recent releases, as their CDs yielded only 1 or 2 bankable songs from the likes of Michael Jackson, George Michael, Lionel Ritchie, etc. Simply Red's remake of Dylan's Positively 4th Street was sad to say the least; it's like doing a Stones' or Beatles' song ... don't go there.Simply Red's first US release surpasses this. Picture Book gave us tunes that are unmistakingly Simply Red, songs like Money$ Too Tight to Mention, Holding Back the Years, Sad Old Red (great jazz), Jericho, etc. Their second release, Men and Women, wasn't bad either. But I never liked any of their other works as much as Picture Book because I saw them do it live in Chicago and the show was awesome. Keep looking ... you can surely find a better Simply Red release than this."
2,average&by the numbers,back in the 80's I use to really dig Simply Red but as time wore on I noticed they got stuck in a formula&haven't changed one bit.now Mick Hucknall is a Cat that I respect His Vocals but even he can't make Average Material sound Good.since the 80's they have had songs that I have dug but nothing I'd break the Bank for.this Album is fairly run of the Mill&they have done far better in the past.
1,LOVE Sunrise... hate the rest,"I bought this CD because of Sunrise, and was hoping for at least one or two other original fun songs. I am sadly disappointed. The rest is drippy, unimaginative crud, so sorry to say. I still love Sunrise, though. Should have downloaded the song instead."
5,continuing Simply Red...,"The last Simply Red album I purchased was Stars. DirecTV offered this album as a concert. I recorded it and have been watching it ever since. Don't know what bothered anyone else, but this is the best album ever that I have heard from them. His voice and the backups are excellent!! I continue to listen to my recording and hope more will!! There is not a song that I do not like on this album."
5,A definite buy!,"I have enjoyed simply red in the past, but had not heard anything in a few years. Heard one track, and had to hear more. Its a great CD, with a couple cover tunes. Such an enjoyable cd to listen to at any time, especially in the car driving! Pick it up!!!!"
5,Home is spectacular!,"If you're a Simply Red fan, this is a MUST HAVE for your collection. If you're not...then this is a great album to start off with.You know how there are some CD's that you can listen to all the way through, without skipping any tracks? ""Home"" is one of those. Mick Hucknall has never sounded better, and the rest of Simply Red follows suit. ""Sunrise"" is definitely the ""it"" song on the album, but others, like ""Fake"", ""Home"" and ""Money in My Pocket"" are absolutely addictive. You're bound to be in a good mood after a listen.This music is the result of a lifetime of study, practice, persistence and passion...and it shows. Bravo!"
2,Simply stinky,"Can we say ""one hit wonder""! What a random cd! One would think that the creator of such a unique and intriguing song, Sunrise, would have a better cd that captured the flow and feel of that in Sunrise however this is not the case. The song Sunrise is completely out of place in this cd. If one didn't know better they would assume that this cd was made in the 80's, and not in the Blondie/David Bowie/Oingo Boing 80's but the maudlin sounds of Michael Bolton 80's. I rate this cd a capitol P capitol U."
1,Simply horrendous,"This has got to be, quite simply, one of the worst albums I've ever had the displeasure of hearing. Boring and utterly worthless garbage from a band (now a one-man band, anyway) who lost it a long, long time ago.The better moments (and I use the term very loosely), such as 'Fake' are forgettable, run-of-the-mill pop. The rest is embarassing. Avoid like the plague."
4,Dyani last studio session,"This is Johnny Dyani's last recording. The great Blue Notes bassist is heard in his peculiar afro-hard bop jazz with a clear influence of Ornette Coleman. Strong rhythmic drive, never really plain and simple in its moods. A great Billy Hart adds the often quite hypnotic music a touch of contemporary american drumming. This is fresh and original, often joyous jazz, whose influences always came unpredictably from a Music full od ""sound of surprise""."
5,Please Amazon,please place an order 4 more nocturne stategy guides. this game is mad fun and very challenging. please 4 the sake of rpgers everywhere(and so i dont have to pay 60-90$ 4 a freakin strategy guide).
5,BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ ON HEALTH,EXCELENT BOOK FOR MOTIVATION AND GHANGING YOUR BODY. ONE OF THE ONLY BOOKS THAT GIVES YOU THE TOOLS TO GHANGE YOUR THINKING SO YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR EATING HABITS. METABOLIZE GIVES YOU LOTS OF FOOD CHOICES AND PLENTY OF TASTY STUFF. GIVE IT A TRY. IT WORKS!
2,UNREALISTIC!,This is a great DIET if you like to be told what to eat and if you like sprout wheat bread.The overall program is decent but the author gives you a list of foods you MUST eat which means RESTRICTION and long-term dissatisfaction.
5,A Wonderful Cup of tea,"While traveling in Ireland I was served this wonderful tea..ever since I got back (2yrs ago) I have enjoyed this teadaily..Very smooth and bite...so when you want to relax witha good cup of tea, this is the one I would suggest."
3,Should have been better,"I have been a huge Dead to Fall fan ever since I heard them. Both Everything I Touch Falls to Pieces and Villainy & Virtue were awsome CDs. I could not wait to hear this one after I heard it was going to come out. After the first three songs I knew this CD was going to kick ass. However, all the songs start sounding the same after that. There really isn't any song that stands out above the others on this disk. Not to say this is a bad disk; it just should have been better. Maybe John should keep a few band members instead of having a completely different line-up on each disk. Just a thought since the other two are way better than this disk."
5,PERCUSSIVE GENIUS,I heard this recording in the mid seventies and when the track PARANA came on I thought what a perfect piece of music.Not only is the vocal arrangement excellent so is the rythmn to.With his wife Flora and noted session musicians he conjours up some magic on this a must for everyone as far asI am concerned.You must check out some of his other recordings like[THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS]FROM1992]also [PROMISES OF THE SUN]and [FREE]early recordings and [SEEDS ON THE GROUND]which is more percussion orientated you wont regret it.
5,Excellent Brazilian Tunes,I have been looking for a recording of this for about 25 years and finally found it. I love the musicianship on this Brazilian recording.
1,cambridge is a sham,"I ordered this set on dec 20, 2004. I still have not recieved the items as of Aug 9th, 2005. Amazon says product is back ordered every month. The vendor just doesn't want to honor its sales price from last christmas. Do not order from this company!!"
4,History?,"Over the years, I have read this novel a number of times. Contrary to many interpretations of this work, I did not view it as a historical novel, at least not the history that is represented on the surface. Instead, it is the history of Poland, Christianity and Judaism now, then and every time in between. Furthermore, it is a story of the human condition. One should not approach this novel in a literal sense. If you do, you are bound to be disappointed."
4,"Not Singer's best, but a good way to view his creative drives","This novel, a pre-history of Poland, is really a post-history of Isaac Singer. The concerns of his character and the characterization of this Poland is Singer's: a man who has a plural marriage (this time with a mother and daughter, sometimes it is two sisters, sometimes unrelated women), who grows disgusted with eating meat, and whose only faith is the belief in death. This is the end of The Family Moskat: ""Death is the real Messiah, and that is the truth!"" And here it is again, slightly less brilliant and stiring, but not without some drama and interest. Singer's Poland (like Singer's New York) is really about the difficulty of finding and maintaing belief in our world, a world that works to strip us of it with unbending will."
3,Its ok,"Pros - the reception on this is great, and there is much less static as opposed to a lot of the other fm transmitters. Good but not great quality of sound. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the highest I give it a 5Cons- Does not charge my iPod nano"
1,A year in the life,"Wanted a Kindle Fire DownloaD NOT THE ACTUAL bOOK, BUT DO NOT WANT TO RETURN IT AND PAY POSTAGE, GUESS i WILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOOK IS AVAILABLE THROUGH kINDLE fIRE"
4,Nice but not as kid expected!,"This toy gun pop sound is muffled, and its trigger is louder than when you have the amo strip. The scope is hollow and I wonder my kid likes it with lenses."
2,Toy Grizzly Rifle,"Not a very good purchase. I was trying to replace a 25 year old toy rifle that finally broke (after 2 generations of Kids used it), this one did not fill the bill. It broke within a week of getting it."
3,Cap gun....? not really,"Bought this for my 6 yr old grandson. I think the gun itself is ok but the strip caps purchased along with it really don't go off...the occasional cap that does go off from the strip simply makes a very, very low, muffled pop..You have to listen carefully and you might hear the one to two that do go off the entire strip....the sound of pulling the trigger is actually louder than the cap itself. He enjoys playing with the gun itself but would be happier if the caps worked. Purchasing the caps were a waste of money. If you want an actual ""cap gun"" where you hear the caps, this isn't it."
1,Disappointed my son...,"Well when I did the search on amazon I entered ""wooden gun"". This gun came up and so I thought it was made of wood. It's not...it's plastic and my son is very disappointed. He thought he was getting a wooden gun and he spent his own money to buy this. I feel bad for him because I helped him pick it out. It's very light weight and I am sure it will be broken in no time. I(my son) wouldn't have purchased if we had know it was plastic. =((("
2,Soft Harness,It serves the purpose. I am a female saxophonest and the harness do not fit acoss my chest. Maybe if they could come up with something that dropped a little lower; say around the waist it would receive 5 stars from me. I use it for practice but I would never ware it in public. Thank you.
1,not a wise purchase,"A hodge-podge of unrelated or adjunct information designed to flank the subject of the title or ""the middle-of-the-book tactic""..classic disguise for a chapter or less disguised as book. Two or three pages of ""how-to"" do PLR on another person; basically relaxing, visualization, and presuming hyponotic effect will then occur. More updated folks don't waste your time or dime on this one."
5,Very entertaining,One of the books that you have for times on your wish to read list. Now I got the opportunity to read it and unlike a lot of comments tell about a slow start I do not really recognized that. I was intrigued from start to finish and indeed the symbolism in the book is great. Having only read Oliver Twist and a Christmas Carol from Dickens this was a book from a different league. The story tells about real life: hardly any black and white but loads of shades of grey.
3,"An interesting book, but easy to read","the story is very interesting, but since Dickens is a person of the nineteenth century, his english may not be easily comprehand by people who is not native english speaker."
5,Trying once again,"I got this for my husband and he says it's five stars, for sure. I tried reading it twice in the past and always got bogged down but I plan to try again when he has finished reading it. I made it through James Joyce's Ulysses; I can make it through A Tale of Two Cities!"
5,A Pleasent Story,In the novel A Tale of Two Cities has many interesting characters. The one I have chosen is Mrs. Pross is a hard working woman and a trustful person but her eyes were swollen and red so she couldn't see very well. A lady was walking down the street and asked her a question that turned into a fight with Mrs. Pross holding the lady tight in her strong arms.I like this book because it has rich description. I am so glad I read this book because my mom read this book in ninth grade and I'm in sixth grade. I recommend this book because the characters come alive and you feel that your really there. I really enjoyed this book and I hope you do too if you read book!!!!!
1,Doesn't even deserve 1 star.,"This is an awful book. I would just assume to eat it than read it again. If you have anything better to do, don't read this book. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
3,Over Hyped Mumbo Jumbo,"*Short and Simple Review*Charles Dickens was payed for each word, and with that being said that explains why most people will be extremely turned off by this book. What I mean by that is Charles over describes and repeats lots of matters that dont need to be. Also with little dialogue in long periods of the books, the book tends to get boring, monotonous to read, and easy to get lost in.Difficulty wise this book is hard for those who are not proficient or advanced readers not only because of the confusing old style language, but also because of those long paragraphs i mentioned earlier. Plot is pretty straightforward and predictable throughout the book if you understand it.Overall this book is not as good as a book as i thought and i think its over hyped simply because its Charles Dickens.PS If it is required for you to read this book go to spark notes not only for summaries, but also to read their No Fear Literature section (Translates the whole novel into readable english!)"
1,?,"if you don't like reading books with way too much detail than don't buy this book. when i was reading it i couldn't understand anything it said. if you are older maybe you wouldn't think it's boring, or if you like this author's books, but i thought it was very boring and it took me forever and a half to read."
1,"IT WAS THEN THE SCARLET LETTER, NEED I SAY MORE?","This book was so bad, I considered it bad. MY eyes burned out. I almost was at the point of suciude after the first page. MY friend George suggested I read it for a book report. I didn't relize it was April Fools. Now Goerge is dead."
1,i hate it,"This book was mindless dribble. i hated it. too many words. I'd like to see him keep a sentence under 1,000 words. If I turned in a paper written in that charles guy's style, i'd get an F."
2,The end just doesn't justify the means.,"The symbolism and plot of the final three chapters of the book made what I consider to be one of the best closings of all time. However, the 300+ pages of drawn out language and wasted talk before the closing makes this book somewhat tedious and annoying. I'm a sophomore in High School and was forced to read this book for my Honors English II class. I must say that I consider myself to be an above average reader, and I would have gone crazy had it not been for the intervention of Cliff's Notes. Furthermore, I feel that the same points that Dickens got across about the French Revolution could have been expressed in half as many words. The characters wandered aimlessly among each other until they finally collided in one big bang at the end. In closing, I loved the final 3 chapters, but the immense amount of time wasted in getting there and figuring out where I was really spoiled the total experience for me."
3,nope,"i didn't like this book and i don't really know why. i guess it's just the mood i was in, it's too somber for my tastes."
2,Not so great expectations,"It's the book that turned me off of Dickens. I still shudder when I think of being forced to read it in high school. The descriptions just go on forever...make it stop!Pip, an orphan, meets an escaped convict and treats him kindly. This simple action will change Pip's life forever. Pip falls in love with Estella, a cold-hearted girl, who, thanks to bitter Miss Havisham, has been well-trained as a heartbreaker. She is wealthy and looks down on Pip, a poor boy with no expectations.When a mysterious benefactor gives Pip a fortune, Pip is sure that becoming a gentleman is the way to win Estella's heart. Pip spends most of the novel feeling ashamed of the people who love him and sacrifices everything to pursue Estella, who couldn't care less for him.I have never been brave enough to pick this one up again, even though I may well appreciate it now. This book is perfect for readers who enjoy a writer who uses twenty words when one will do!"
5,Amazon book,I have enjoyed this book.It was a good purchase and would recommend it to anyone. I am sure my family will listen to it also.
3,Inexpensive,"This is a classic novel... most kids are forced to read it (as my daughter recently was) in high school. She purchased this for her English class. She thought it was boring (so did I), but you can't beat the price on Amazon! Good buy!"
2,I'm Sorry If You Are Forced To Read This,I thought this book was tedious and unimformative with the most action at the end which was barely any. Do your best to make your english teacher spare you from reading this. Cliff Notes are even boring!
3,starts too slow - last third shines,"It takes the first two-thirds of this book to set everything in place for the rich action and powerful emotions of the last third. That is not to say that there are not a few interesting points, some entertaining action, and attractive character development early on, but most modern readers are anticipating the drama of the French Revolution, and this is a long, slow build-up. The action finally kicks off somewhere around page 200 - too late for the taste of today's bookworm.As in other Dickens novels, the young female is a weakly drawn character, not even the Agnes of David Copperfield. Why is it that we find Dickens able to create a Miss Pross or a Betsy Trotwood, but not a realistic and admirable young heroine?"
4,Really 3.5 stars,"""A Tale of Two Cities"" is essentially good. I loved the plot. I especially enjoyed the ending, which was both sad and uplifting. This novel (originally a series) shows how good an author Dickens could have been.However, Dicken's style is really what costs him the 1.5 stars in my review. I dislike the amount of microscopic attention he pays to the most insignificant things. Luckily, for Dickens, this is not as egregious as it was in ""Great Expectations"" but its still there. I can't blame Dickens for this completely. This was basically a style forced upon him by his bosses in order to sell more newspapers. However, that fact does not mean I can just ignore it. There are also some issues with unrealistic characters.Overall, if you're a patient reader, you'll be rewarded. If not, find another author."
5,One of the Greatest Dickens Novel,A Tale of Two Cities is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Dickens uses sets up his Characters and plot is fantastic. The stroy came together so perfectly in the Novels climax. I believe this is not only one of Dicken's best novels but best novel period. How could anyone give this book less than five stars?!
3,Sure...,"the descriptions might have been written to fill us in and catch our attention, or they may have been written because Dickens was paid by the word. Still, it is a good and interesting work, and I enjoyed reading it. Set aside some time, though..."
5,Truly a magnificent classic for all time,"I love when I'm able to adore a text I've heard about my entire reading life that has been described a masterpiece. Charles Dickens one of the best writers ever. I had to get over my fear of being disappointed over something that has been exhaulted. I was not only NOT disappointed, I gained further trust in myself and abilities as a fine reader. You will too. I envy those who haven't read it yet."
5,terrifying and moving,"this is dickens' most emotionally powerful novel. the final scene on the scaffold is one of the few times dickens elicits the tears without doing violence to the reader's sensibilities. the tears flow naturally and willingly. the story is nicely structured, and there are no wasted subplots, characters, or even words: everything works towards the single end of telling the story of people swept up in the destructive wave of the french revolution. the greatest achievement, though, is the unyielding atmosphere of disquiet transformed to terror that overhangs the whole book. dickens was always supremely good at creating atmosphere, or ""mood"", but TOTC is his greatest sustained effort. (that it's also one of his shortest books might have something to do with that!)"
3,Good reading,This book ought to be the required reading for every student. It will make them be thankful that they live in a time that where they can go anywhere and not asked about papers when they travel.
1,A Tale of Two Cities,This version was no better than the previous word to text system on the kindle. Disappointing to say the least.
3,Very educational,"It is dificult to read, but that is why I am reading it.To get the feel of the political scene of the times and try to understand the poverty and harsh conditions in which the common people lived. The story proves the old adage THAT POWER CORRUPTS AND ABSOLUTE POWER CORRUPTS ABSOLUTLY. This is true today in many of the cultures of the world where dictators or other corrupt leaders rule. Sometimes freedom is won by violence and war. Human nature hasn't changed and only common sense, earning our own living and decency should prevail. Only under our United States Constitution, or one simular, can people truly be free to make their own choices and receive the consequences of their of their actions."
5,Dickens' Great Historical Fiction,"This was Dicken's only historical fiction novel, but it was one of the best ever. This is one of my favorite books, and Dickens is one of my favorite authors. Dickens weaves a thrilling story of romance, conspiracy, and danger during the French Revolution time. Lucie Manette's father is finally freed from prison with the help of enigma Mr. Lorry. Then Englishman Charles Darnay is accused of treason. During the trial it is pointed out that he looks just like Sydney Carton, the defense lawyer, so he goes free. Then he, Carton, and another lawyer, Mr. Stryver, all go for Lucie Manette's affections. Darnay marries her, but all does not go well. The French police return and call Darnay to another trial, where he is pronounced guilty. The rest is for you to find out. If you like the book too, I also recommend David Copperfield."
5,Definately readable stuff.,This is a good book for a high school student to read. I recommend teachers in Language or communication studies to assign this free book for student with nooks and tablets.
4,interesting times,a good read to get a better understanding of life during those times and just how fickle legal judgements were made both in England and revolutionary France.
3,A Tale of Two Cities,Heavy going and very slow. It is however a classic. Have still not managed to finish it as the story is well known enough without getting bogged down in the 'Dickens method'
5,A classic...,"Seems our schools have drifted away from teaching to the classics in favor of material attempting to promote racial awareness. I can't type my son's outlook on that topic here, but suffice it to say he felt cheated. I came across a film version of Great Expectations and was very surprised (and disappointed!) that he wasn't familiar with the story. After watching the film, he was interested in the book. Picked up both Great Expectations and A Tale of Two Cities as a brief intro to the classics for him."
3,I expected more,"Dickens is always good, but for all the hype I expected more. I'm glad I read it and can mark it off my list."
4,4,I would recommend this book to CassidyI dislike the book because is not fun to read about it when it's fun.
4,I like it,It loaded to my kindel in a flash. It is a little had for me to understand all the words. It is a classic.
4,Charles Dickens invented Binary Code,"Amazed to find Charles Dickens has Madam Defarge using binary code to record the executions and events of the revolution. Why do I think this? Binary Code uses two numerical symbols, Knitting is comprised of only 2 stitches, K and P. Patterns are only formed when you drop, cross over, or enter from the front or back of these two stitches.I am typing this on a modern computer using computer codes that would not work without someone discovering binary code - maybe Madam Defarge has a computer hidden in her wine shop somewhere!!A very good read of an old partly known story through film."
4,"Great story, tough read","The story is compelling, a little slow to start, but it does hold your interest.I know old english can be difficult to read, but the way Dickens uses it borders on unreasonable. I almost threw in the towel a couple of times. He must have been paid by the word or line to write this book.In some parts of the book he loses the long winded alliterations, but it could be scaled back even more in all areas.This is a must read book, not only for the way the story is constructed, but for the historical background and the telling of the culture in France around the time of the revolution."
5,A Tale of Two Cities,A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a wonderful classic book! I had not read this before and even though it took me a bit to get used to the way it's written I was so engrossed in the book that I was shocked when it ended! I wanted it to go on and on. Highly recommend reading this book even if you have trouble with the way the language is written at first. You'll get used to it and love the book.
2,Tale of Two Cities,Difficult read due to it being written in old english. Now I remember why I didn't like reading it in high school. I will finish it though.
1,could not read it...,After the first memorable sentences I lost interest in the book. I was not even sure that I am reading the original in this kindle version- as if the language was not good enough.Hard to recommend. But it is Dickens so where did I go wrong?
3,A pretty good book but not the best.,"A while back I decided to expand my knowledge of literature so I started reading A Tale of Two Cities. The first part of the book is somewhat difficult to get through because it is so dry. But after you get past the boring part it really starts to get good. My main complaint was that Dickens spent too much time giving detail to objects and people. If you are patient and looking for a good book, than the A Tail of Two Cities would be a good novel to read."
4,I grew to respect it.,"I had to read this for my Freshmen Honors English class two years ago. The ending did, and still does ring a bit false to me. However, it is put together masterfully, if a bit verbosely. Nonetheless, this book is not my favorite of all time and my rating reflects that."
3,"Not a bad ending, but...","Ambrose Bierce once quipped that a novel is a short story padded. This was never more true than in Victorian England, where authors were paid by the word and being long winded was the best tactic for an author who didn't want to starve. The result of this trend is A Tale of Two Cities one of the greatest short stories padded in the history of English literature, a great forty page novella tacked on to the end of a mediocre 300 page epic. Indeed most of the parts set in revolutionary Paris are quite interesting, but unfortunately these are overshadowed by the fact that the vast majority of the story takes place in London, where astonishingly little happens. Still if you like your action and plot twists served with a large helping of melodrama then this is probably the book for you."
2,This book should actually be less than 100 pages,"This book virtually had no recognizable point for the first several hundred pages. When a distinguishable storyline actually appeared, I was able to follow, but had absolutely no clue who the characters were. I admit the last 1/3 of the book was very intriuging, but it could be severly condensed. Too much plot excess."
5,A book for all to enjoy,"I just read 'A Tale of Two Cities' in my high school gifted English class. I must say that I loved it! Not only did Dickens capture the ""truth"" of the French Revolution, but also the culture of the time. How Lucie faints(which ""ladies"" of the time did), the horrible judicial conditions, etc. It was also interesting that Dickens separated the book into 3 different parts. Some authors do that to symbolize past, present, and future. Also the fact that most of the characters have a twin(Carton and Darnay, Lucie and her mother, etc). The many references to religion and the bible[Jerry Cruncher compared to Jesus Christ(JC)-not a coincidence]. I do agree though that the beginning of the story was a bit slow, but so was the beginning of the revolution. After the first few chapters of the book, the story started to become clear:)"
2,Tale of Two Cities,"The tale of two cities compares the actions of the rich on the poor people living in the slums of Paris and London. It is a very depressing story, but is also a story that illustrates the power of the human sprit wnen ordinary people do extraordinary deeds. The depressing lives of the poor people who live in the slums are very well described, and are compared to the extravigant and opulant lives of the ""Aristocrates"" who would view a poor person in the same light as they view a stray dog. Human life has no value. When the poor begin to rise up againist their oppressors, the poor treat the aristocrates in the same way as they were treated, namely with the gillotine. Bloodshed, death and unfairness are the three words that describe this book. I enjoyed this book, but I will not read it again. Many words used are out of fashion and it is difficult to understand the language used and the structures of the sentences."
2,Ehhh...,"The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is because I AM actually very interested in the French Revolution (and this book almost killed that for me). But I just COULD NOT get into this book! I tried very hard, but ultimately, I had to toss it. The language.... .... everything. Its so boring and wordy! I just cannot understand how this is considered an amazing piece of literature. I feel very guilty about this review because society has made me feel as though I should enjoy reading a Charles Dickens' ""classic""... but I cannot deny it any longer. This sucked."
3,"It was the best of times, but could have been much better.","I have already heard several reviews for this book, hearing of those who hate it and those who love it. I am very skeptical about this book. I read both the book and the cliff notes, and found the story to be rather intriguing, and rather boring. One has said not to knock a book just because you don't understand it. Well I feel that is one of the best reasons to knock a book. Getting to the point, Charles Dickens was able to create a very good storyline, but he dumbed it down too much. I felt reading"
3,It was the best of times.. It was the worst of times..,"Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities is an excellent piece of literature. It grips the reader, with twist after twist, making you want to know what's next. The way Dickens can develop two plots independently and then merge them into a further thickening plot is amazing, and he did it before the age of ""modern"" literature."
2,More literary nonsense...,"This book, despite what every single English teacher will ever tell you, is nonsense. Dickens is, and always has been, overrated. Although there are parts of it I liked--especially the way Dickens used the present-tense for the last chapter--this book isn't all that great.Of course, as an American patriot, I'm biased. I like American authors more. To be even more biased, I like 20th Century American authors (Hemingway, Henry Miller, Fitzgerald, Michener, et cetera). Dickens wasn't completely talent-free, but for pete's sake, this book wasn't all that good.I'd feel much more enriched if we'd spent a month in my sophomore year studying ""A Farewell To Arms"" than this, if we have to stick to books about wars. Maybe some day we'll open our eyes and see that age does not a classic make."
2,It was confusing and long!!!,"""A Tale of Two Cities"" for me was a very hard book to be ""caught up"" in. After a while the book became long, boring and tiresome to read. Even though Dickens' capture of the Revolution does make you think you are there it just never really got my attention as something really good to read. If you like Dickens I'm sure it would be a great book you wouldn't wanna put down but if you aren't really fond of Dickens work I wouldn't recommend reading it, unless you need to"
2,Not impressed,This book was so old and yellowed. I hate the font and the looks of the book. I recommend you to buy a newer addition!
3,Ho-hum,"Haven't we all had to read A Tale of Two Cities for some high school English class? I did, and it was the last time I really read it until recently. It's still hard to read and I still found myself skimming through paragraphs to get to things that seem more important that the constant descriptions of landscape and unimportant characters. I find it strange to have to wade through 300 pages of words, when the story could have been fit on 100 pages easily. You could take out the entire middle of the book and still know exactly what the plot was. It's been 5 years since the first time and the second time I have read this 'classic' and it made no more sense to me now than when I was in high school and had the cliff notes. And I love to read! So read it if you have to for class, but other than that, it's a little dull."
3,interesting read,"Its not a riveting book, but the story is solid and has depth. The early pages in the book read slow and bog down in probably some unecessary detail. If you are looking to read the classics, there are others I would personally recommend before A Tale. Its all been said before though. If you haven't read it, or has been several decades, its worthwhile to know the 'classics'."
3,Better than I thought,"A Tale of Two Cities was the first difficult book I have ever read. At first I couldn't understand what was going on. Dickens' use of imagery clouded my mind. However, upon reading it further, the book started to flow better. I actually read ahead of the class because the story started to become interesting. My favorite thing that Dickens does is the way he puts something in the story that doesn't seem very relevant at the point, but turns out being very important such as Madame Defarge's ""knitting."" I also liked his way of foreshadowing like with the street lamps in the beginning.This book even helps with history and the French Revolution. I totally recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in any of Dickens' works."
3,a little disappointed,"We needed this for a prop for our play. It is pictured as a classic bound hardback book and we did not read that it had a photo on the cover. We could not use it for our play because it was a modern edition with a beautiful colored picture on the front. The story is still great and we are glad to have it in our collection, but it was not what we needed."
4,Very Good!,"This book was very entertaining even though I had to read it for school.Many interesting things happen and they make you want to keep reading to see how they end up. It is a realistic depiction of life in France during the Revolution. Any questions you have during the novel are all answered in the last couple of chapters and everything comes together;you start understand why certain things happened. It can be a little too descriptive at times, but otherwise it was very good. Pay attention to details, they will be helpful as the story progresses. TIP:KEEP ON READING, EACH PAGE IS BETTER THAN THE ONE BEFORE IT!"
4,Great in the end,"A Tale of Two cities was boring until you got to about page 300. At that point, all the information that you have come across earlier in the book is tied together and suspence is added. I recommend the book to those who have time on their hands and an extended vocabulary."
1,Fraudulent Advertising,"I did not realize that, to avoid being scammed, it was necessary to read a complete description of this product, including customer reviews, before purchasing. This book, listed as a paperback version of A Tale of Two Cities, is, in fact, a ""retelling"", I suppose for children! What an unscrupulous seller! There is an obvious intent to mislead here. Beware is right! Don't buy from this seller!"
1,A Tale of Two Cities,"This is obviously a great book, my ""one"" star rating has to do with Cassia Press, the publisher of the version I bought. DO NOT BUY IT FROM CASSIA PRESS!!! I have never read a book so carelessly proofread in all my life; repeated lines and misspelled words all over the place. How do you not take the time to spell check? There are plenty of other publishers to buy this novel from, avoid Cassia Press at all costs."
3,A Tale of Two Cities,Good book a classic . Great for the price. This book should be in every library. Dickens is an excellent author.
3,It was a gift,No feed back. It was a gift - I received not feedback.Dumb to require a set number of words in a review.
5,Great Edition,Enough biblio/source info in intros for the dedicated Dickens lover. A good buy at the discounted price on A.com or used book store. Third time reading A Tale; gets better everytime.
5,Revisit a classic!!,This is the best fictional book to read about the French Revolution. It is a timeless story beautifully told. You feel as if you are there in the crowd watching and listening to the story unfold.
4,Tale of Two Cities,"It is written in somewhat archaic language but that is not a hindrance to enjoyment. Yesterday was my 84th birthday, so I'm kind of archaic too."
3,I've read better but it wasn't the worst book I've read,"I understood this book but as to why everyone thinks it is so marvelous eludes me. I mean, ok what's with someone dying for someone else out of love. It's so fake. You wouldn't see that...not even then, sorry! Charles Dickens is an excellent author...I just don't agree that this was his best novel ever!"
2,Boring and confusing,"There are so many things happening at once, and so many coincidences that make the story seem unreal. The language is weird and I often had to go back and reread because I wasn't paying attention to what I was reading."
3,This novel has a good reason for having uneeded details!,"I was assigned this book for freshman English and knew how Dickens wrote with extreme amounts of detail. My teacher explained to us this year that Dickens was paid by each line he wrote. His ""books"" in this novel were published singularly once a week to hold the people of the town in suspense to find out what was going to happen. If you got paid by each line you wrote, you would have used extreme amounts of detail too!!!!!"
3,Overly Symptathetic With The Nobles,"I realize that at times during the French Revolution (like during the Jacobin Reign of Terror), violence did get a little out of hand. Still, the book presents a very rare case: a noble, who did not want to even be a noble, is being unfairly held by the peasants who have seized control of France and demand that all nobles be killed. The book also can be confusing at times. This is basically, (in my opinion) like all Dickens' works, average."
2,Boring and Predictable,"I guess A Tale of Two Cities is considered a classic because it's long, boring, and deals with an important event in history, IF YOUR FRENCH. Isn't that the criteria for a classic? I think adults are just fooling themselves when they read a book like A Tale of Two Cities. I think they say, ""Oh, this was written before the 1900's. It's long, it's boring, it must be a classic."" English teachers love presenting ""great"" literature to their unsuspecting students. BEWARE, YOU TOO MAY BE TAKEN ALIVE BY THE EVIL OF THE LONG AND BORING LITERATURE, KNOWN AS CLASSICS."
2,Narrator was not so great,"The story itself is great, but I was not so thrilled with the narrator of this audiobook. When he read the parts spoken by Ms. Manette he sounded like Harvey Fierstein in drag. I wish I had returned it and bought a different edition because I love listening to the story."
4,the book was good,"Yea, Charles Dickens can be a bit drab at first but the plot and underlying story is great. NOthing at all of wwhat I expected. Most of my classmates didn't like it --partly becuase they gave up at the begining. After you get a sense of the characters and the whole message--its a great book."
2,no comment,I am currently in the middle of reading this book for my english class and it is very confusing which makes it very boring. I must depend on my teacher and chapter summaries to ge through it. Maybe I'll see that importance of it when I finish it.I wrote that review way back in April 2002 and even now (Jan2003) I still think the book is confusing and boring. I considered taking another stab at it since everyone else seems to be so passionate about it but I just couldn't put my self through such tortue.
3,A great ending but...........,"I myself enjoy reading of Literature of the past: Hawthorne, Smith, Dostoyevsky, Salinger, and Orwell: but Dickenson, while praised by many as one of the greatest writers, always seemed to bore me to death. I don't understand the fascination with his writings. In my humble opinion, his style just isn't enjoyable. So this year, for tenth grade, I had to read Tale of Two Citites, I was disappointed. This seemed very boring in the begining, but since I had to read it, and I love history, I kept going. Around the last 20 chapters or so I got a suprise; I couldn't put the book down! Needless to say I think the ending was amazing, regardless of what I think of his style. I recommend the book just for the ending, but for an overall entertainment value I suggest Crime and Punishment."
2,Outstanding Opening,"Despite the amount of boredom I recieved from this book, I was very intrgued and amazed on how well written the first sentence (In this case it is so long that it is a paragraph) of A Tale of Two Cities was written. Charles Dickens seemed to sum up the whole theme of France and England with a great amount of symbolism and style."
2,"A good story, but . . .","A TALE OF TWO CITIES is far too wordy. What Dickens could have said in a line, he turned into a page. But if you like that kind of stuff, go for it. I found myself scanning the pages and I still didn't miss much."
3,"Dated in its original syntax, see the movie first.","As happens with many historically specific novels, one needs to be familiar with the timeframe and setting of the novel.Today, seeing a film of the novel or the events that surround a historical novel will greatly enhance one's experience in reading the full novel later on.One of Dickens' top novels."
3,It was okay,"I read this book with my 8th grade honors daughter. I say that because we both found it to be hard to follow. I am a college graduate. So maybe it was because we were trying to tea it for educational purposes, or maybe it was just plain too many discriptions, but we found it monotonous. However, upon completion, understanding the larger picture of the symbolicness that your past does not define your future and that no matter what death you experience, you were created to live was both powering and inspiring."
4,A Tale of Two Cities Revisited,"Have not finished reading - read in high school and revisiting - much more enjoyable this go round, and I look forward to finishing same."
5,it desirves more than 5 stars,this is a great bok about how england and france use to be. how the rich people used to be mean to the other. its also a tory about a man who was put to death because he want to keep the beloved people together forever. this is actully my favorite book because while you are reading this book you can actually see it in your imagination.......... you just cant put this book down once you've started... its just a great and awsum book!
1,Dickens rambles on way too much,"I feel this could have been a better book had he not been paid for its length. It takes him too long to say simple things. If you hated Old Man and the Sea, you too will hate this."
1,Great Cover. Otherwise...,"An endless, endless, endless story that would've been 1/3rd its length had Dickens not been being paid by the word. I still think his masterpiece is 'A Christmas Carol.' Certainly not this. Or his other exceedingly wordy tomes. But they say it's egregious to disparage a classic. Well, now I'll have to look up the meaning of ""egregious."""
1,IT WAS SO BORING I THOUGHT I WOULD DIE FROM BORDOM,"Some people may like it some don't, I am one who does not like it. I had to read the book my freshman year in high school. Now that I've graduated and look back on all the books that I have read it was one of the most boring books on the face of this earth!! Teachers and schoolboards must use this book as a touture method in school. Another boring book is Wuthering Heights, I won't even discuss that one."
4,A Tale of Two Cities,"This is one of the classics. It was required reading when I was in high school, back in the 60s. I have read it several times since, but I wanted a new copy for my library. It is beautifully written. It offers a good review of early times in French history and the descriptions are vivid, poetic and visceral in the way Dickens writes. He makes you feel just like you are there amongst the locals. He lets you feel the fear, the suffering, and lets you smell the smells of the streets of France in the time of their revolution. The book is so worth reading if it is new to you or rereading if you have read it before. I just love it."
5,Read this book.,"I cant begin to explain how powerful and dramatic this book was for me to read. I cant wait to read it again. The style of writing is older but that is what I came to love about it. I can hardly bear a modern writing style any more. After reading this I found it impossible to read some of my previous favorite books simply beacause the language is so modern and simple. I have since read many of the classics (as I would call them) from the 18th and 19th centuries. I am about to read my second Dickens novel and I can only hope it will inspire me as much as this book did. I have always enjoyed reading but this book takes my enjoyment to a whole new level. I havent stopped reading since I finished it. I also must admit, I stayed up all night reading the last part and cried like a girl after finishing it. I just sat my kindle down and had a serious reflection on what it is to be human. I quite hope everyone who loves life gets to read this book."
4,Tricky to follow but very intertaining.,This one of those great classics that I did not get around to reading until recently. I found it a little hard to follow but very entertaining. I am getting tired of mindless tv and am getting back to reading more.
2,"For God's sake, get to the point!","Don't get me wrong, Dickens is a great author. I love Oliver Twist. But rambling on for three pages just to tell the reader of the exact way Lucie's eyebrow twitched when she found that Charles was in prison does NOT make me want to turn the page for the next exciting event. I supposed the endless blabbing is what makes this a classic- I wish the standards would change."
1,No better than any other novel,"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax."
1,A Tale of One City Would Have Been Plenty,Dont buy this book! Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long. Wow I mean talk about boreing. Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times? You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times. Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there!
3,I'm not sure...,"I read this book for school, and although I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, I found the tidbits of plot hard to pick out from the filler material. I recently learned that Dickens wrote for a publication which paid him by the word, and that makes sense to me, because there sure were a lot of words! I will, however, say that I found the ending incredibly poetic and poignant. This was my favorite part of the book by far, but I'm not sure if it was because it was beautiful, or if I could see the ending in clear view. The plot was wonderful, though."
2,Alright,It was an alright book and i would recommend if you like the author Charles dickens and his previous works
4,"great descriptions, poor story","Never did know why Dickens gets so much credit. The story here is horrible, lots of ridiculous, impossible coincedences. However, the description of life in London and Paris at this time, and the horrors of the French revolution, are great. Read this shortly before visiting the museum in the Palace of Justice in Paris, which helped bring the exhibits to life."
5,Amazing,This book it slow at the start but picks up pace and has a great plot with a beautiful ending!
2,Disappointed,"I got this book because I remember reading it in High School and I wanted to revisit it and read it once more. I enjoy it in High School, but my tastes have changed."
3,Very interesting,"I hadn't read anything such like this book. Different, elaborate and just all around interesting. I have to say it took a little more time to get it but I decided to start over and see if I could get a better understand but once I read half n started again it made so much more sense."
4,Tale of two cities,All the books were great. Tale of two cities was as boring as it was in hight school. Hoped I'd enjoy it more now. Didn't.Play the games occasionally. Usually waiting in the doctor's office. Husband likes them alot more than I do.
3,A classis,Forcing a review to have a minimum number of words is silly and stupid. so there so there so there!
4,Great writing,"I love Charles Dickens and his ability to transport you to another era, this is no exception. An enjoyable read but my favourite is still Great Expectations!"
1,"Great literature, poor formatting.","This edition simply did not display properly on my Kindle 2. Long lines alternating with short lines (frequently only one word) made this edition just unreadable for me.A Tale of Two Cities (Penny Books)comes out just fine. Perhaps the lesson learned for me is to download a sample first, but the failed formatting of this edition was an unpleasant surprise."
5,A wonderful book,"Charles Dickens A Tale of Two Cities is brillant Well written and a joy to read. Charles Dickens is a genius. If you love to learn about the french revolution , this is the book to read.You wont be able to put it down."
2,"It's School, what can I say?","This book, being required by my sophmore english teacher, wasnt quite as exiting as I would have imagined. A confusing plot and old language style can have a puzzling effect on the reader. If you plan on reading this book, read it at your own pace because it can sometimes take time to keep track of what is going on."
2,"This book was incredibly confusing , to many things at once","The Tale of Two Cites was a verey intresting book at first it was just fine , not confusing at all. Then as you on go on in the book it gets very confusing. Like how it goes between the two cites. But for the most part it was a very intresting book"
2,WATCH THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is long and boring. Dickens describes the hell out of everything-just get to the point. The book only made sense when my teacher explained it. If Dickens got paid by the word then he was one rich guy.
5,Perhaps the Greatest Book I've read so far,"This is by far the best book that I've read in my 15 years of life. This book has everything that a reader could want; mystery, suspense, drama, humor, etc. There are characters in this book that you will never forget, especially Sidney Carton. Every event that happens in this book is somehow related to the plot. The scenes and events are especially vivid. Dickens is truly a master of imagery. As you read the book the characters become a part of you, and live on in your mind. If you read this book, you will not be disappointed, I guarantee it. "" It is a far, far better thing to read this book.&quot"
4,This book gives you suprise after suprise.,This book is full of completely believable coincedences. How are you to know that when ___ marries ___ that he is the son of the man who threw ___'s father into a prison where he went somewhat crazy. If you want to fill in the blanks you'll have to read the book yourself. Sorry
5,Can't go wrong w/a classic,I bought this for my granddaughter's summer reading...a great classic.You can't go wrong w/Charles Dickens..highly recommended and one of those books everyone should have read.
5,A Tale of Two Cities,"This was required reading for school, so I did not particularly enjoy the book because it is a little dry and hard to follow. Other than that, the seller was great. This had nothing to do with them."
5,What a great book . . . .,This book draws you in you with details and who an how the characters are with their personality's. It such a great book I truly think everyone should read it.
3,lol,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK.A TALE of two cities is a good book.I recommend this jaw dropping word filled book to many.
5,tale of two cities,Still a masterpiece. It is dickens.Im using this as a test to see if I like the kindle fire. Still unsure about that. I may need thetactile feel of paper. I will try something contemporary before I rule out the kindle. There is a convience to it
1,Book great. Bonus audiobook? Lies.,"Pay $1 for a free public domain book to get a bonus link to a streaming audio version that you could have gotten for free anyway, and it is not even integrated with the written text or an Audible book.5 stars for book but 1 star for ebook"
5,Must read,I can't believe I haven't read this sooner. Everyone should read this book at least once. I had such a hard time putting it down.
5,Rosemary in Spain,"I read this as part of a literature assignment in School, 60 years ago. I loved it then and I still love it now."
1,Tedious!,"Dickens has very beautiful prose, however no amount of poetry would make this a good book. I kept reading because I continued to hope that the story would eventually become interesting, and it took about 60% of the way through before anything substantial happened. Yet even then, I wasn't impressed. Some of the key characters were not sufficiently developed, so the ending lost some of its impact. B-O-R-I-N-G."
1,A Tale Of Two Cities,"I was required to read this book, for my 10th grade English class. I'm still unable to figure out why. This book, was one of the worst I have ever read. I think Charles Dickens is a great author, with many great novels, but this has to be one of his worst. It was interesting at times, but I beacme very confused in his writing, and his ideas jumped around way to much. Which required me to re-read phrases over and over just to start to understand them."
1,The worst book I have ever read!!!!!!!!!,My English teacher made me read this book and I hated every minute of it! The reason I gave this book one star is because there was no choice for zero stars. Spare yourself from reading this book.
3,Highly confusing,"I have never been a fan of Charles Dickens. Great Expectations (when forced to read it) was one of the worst books I have had to read; it was confusing, dragging, completely improbable, and generally annoying.A Tale of Two Cities was definitely an improvement on that one, but was still confusing. The plot jumped around a lot from place to place, often without much explanation as to what was going on. It was compelling in parts, and mysterious enough that I wanted to keep going, but the rest was boring.Just as an example: I was confused about two characters in the middle of the book, and whether they were two people or the same person. I assumed it would be cleared up by the end, and it was just careless reading on my part. Unfortunately, this was not the case. To this day I still have no idea if these two titles are the same person or not. I don't know about anyone else, but to me, that smacks of bad writing."
4,"Crisp, Moving Version","This abridged Pacemaker Classic is short, gripping, and demonstrates the madness that took hold in France during the Revolution's reign of terror. We follow main character Charles Darnay, a decent and dissenting member of the aristocratic Evermonde family who leaves France for England, survives a trial in England, marries there, then is tricked into returning to France to be arrested and charged. We also see the kangaroo court atmosphere that existed in France during those blood-thirsty days; the accused was easily arrested, presumed guilty, and almost always sent to the guillotine. There's also vengeance, as pertains to Madame DeFarge, determined to see that all Evermondes (guilty and blameless) are done away with.Years ago my high school classmates griped that this book (complete version) was boring. But teaching this abridged (94-page) version recently to students in Latin America was fun - most of them (like me) found it crisp and powerful."
4,A Good Review,"I think this book was great! In the beginning of this book some of the words are French or English, which makes them a little hard to read, but once you get past that it turns into an amazing book. This book is about a daughter who saves her father from insanity and brings him home to England. Years after that day the daughter is married and her husband is asked to come to France (the French Revolution is taking place), but once he gets there he is put on death trial because of his fathers' crimes. In the end of the book the husband is saved and they all go back to England."
3,sacrifice for love,I loved this book because its about romance and how a man sacrificed his life to see the women he loves to be happy and to be with her daughter and husband freed because all he did with his life was scam people and he felt good in his heart with at least one good thing that he accomplished in his life so he gave up and switched with here husband and died for her.
2,"Had to read for school, boring","I had to read this book for my summer reading for high school. It took a long time to get into the book and I found it extremely hard to understand. It had way too many antonyms, and it swirled around and would talk for 2 pages about somthing easily told it 3 sentances. Extremely boring and uninteresting. When I saw that Charles Dickens wrote it I thought ""Hey this is going to be good, I mean this is Dickens one of the best, most talked about writers of all time"" but now I think very little of the name Dickens as a writer. I hesitate to read Great Expectations, or Oliver Twist for the sheer lack of a waste of time. 100 pages into the book and I still have no idea what it is about. There was 2 good things about it 1)Where Mrs.Mannette finds her father and 2)When I quit reading it"
2,Great ending to what otherwise I found stale,"It always takes me a while before I really get interested in any story. Unfortunately this story took until almost the end before it really grabbed me. It may not be that bad for you, but I found some of the sentences extremely long. After reading David Copperfield I'm put off by his diction or older cliches, as long as the story is compelling. Many of his descriptive narratives were just too long and drawn out. I think there might have been some clever metaphors that I was just to lazy to think about; or as an excuse I don't know that much about that time in history. The end was full of action and suspense, I don't know if it was more disappointing that the story ended or that the first five-sixths of the book was flat. I hope your experience will be better than mine."
3,Interesting,"The first 3/4 was most interesting. The publisher claims it is a self biography, which however, regarding some of the stories, is questioned by Alan Davies in his biography ""A.J. Cronin - The man who created Dr Finlay"". In the end of the book Cronin gets quite religous, to much for me, who is a religious guy myself."
2,A Tale of Two Cities,It is so heavy and dark. Typically English lit. Don't remember reading it in school. Now I understand why it is free!
5,A Tale of Two Cities,"A book I read 50 years ago, this reading provided me with great respect for the book. Captures French revolutionary times along with a host of characters that are interesting and unique."
2,I know this is a classic but...,It was so hard for me to finish reading this. I get very tired every time I attempt to read some more. I just can't help it I don't really like this book. I am not the biggest Charles Dickens fan.
3,Not for me,"Not my cup of tea but the service was fine. Thanks. The 14 word minimum for reviews of the item, sucks."
5,"Excellent, interesting, beautifully written.","This is the first Dickens book I have ever read... while I have been exposed to may of his works through film. It took a minute or two to get used to the language of his time, Dickens proved to be all that I have ever heard him to be... such a wonderful story. The characters develop and interact and their lives intertwine just perfectly. It's just plain intersting!! He had such a great sense of humor and also conveys deep human emotion. I look forward to reading my next Dickens classic."
1,A Book That NEVER got to The POINT!!,I hated this book from the beginning to the end! I hated how you had to read chapter after chapter about some stupid little detail. I didn't enjoy it and do not recommend it for anyone who likes to read an exciting book that keeps you wanting to read more. This is definitely not a page-turner!
2,"Overrated ""classic""","Sure, the story has some twists at the end, but I find the language arcane as well as archaic. The story-telling is cumbersome and sometime confusing; there are large chunks of narratives about irrelevant details (such as the chapter ""The lion and the jackal"", it does little to advance the plot). The dialogues are pretentious and unnatural -- the characters speak with a lot of parenthesized texts. The actions of the people are also to some extent unexplained and unexplainable: why does Carton sacrifice himself to save Darnay? Because of his love for Lucie? At the end he is portrayed as some larger-than-life hero and martyr, but I find some hollowness and unbelievability in that.Dickens' contemporaries and French counterparts, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas, who also wrote a few books using the same backdrop (the French Revolution). I think they are both better writers and story-tellers."
1,Abosultely Awful: The worst book I've ever read,"It was the worst of times. I had to read A Tale of Two Cities for school.This book proved to any doubters that Charles Dickens was payed by the word, and arguably the most overrated writer in the history of literature.A boring, wordy book with an unexciting, weak, predictable plot.I would not reccomend this book to anybody, unless their sole intention is to rip it up and rightfully critisize it."
5,Nothing short of a masterpiece,"Prior to this book, the only book that I had read for the author was Oliver Twist, and that was because it was required material in school. Once I read this book I truly regretted never having read more books for the author. His style is simply amazing. The author introduces us to different characters one step at a time. In the beginning we don't really understand what is going on, or why a certain character is being described in detail. However, as the story progresses it quickly comes to our mind that what the author is doing is that he is weaving a masterpiece and connecting the different parts together so that what we have in the end is nothing short of a piece of art that will surely stand the test of time. The depth of the characters and the irony of the times that they live in makes this book a must read or all."
5,Review of the Nonesuch Dickens edition,"My review here is not of the novel, but rather of the Nonesuch edition of Dickens' classic. The book itself is a facsimile edition of the 1937 Nonesuch Dickens, and is published by The Overlook Press. The book is in quality hardback. The ""A Tale of Two Cities"" Nonesuch edition has the spine bound in leather and the rest of the cover is cloth-bound [the color of the cloth is gray].The dust jacket is clear quality plastic. The paper quality is of good stock and is cream in color. There is also a red satin ribbon marker.The text is set in Martin's Type and the illustrations are from the original plates. The Nonesuch Dickens Classics are sturdy, handsome editions which are affordable and will enhance any collector's library."
4,Wonderful read,"This is another book I'm sure I was supposed to read as a student and somehow missed. I'm very glad I've read it now. It is a beautiful story full of very good and very bad people. The history itself is brilliantly spelled out. This is definitely on my ""will read again"" list."
3,"It starts out good, and then ends up being boring!","I think it was interesting and all reading the first book, but when you get to books two and three, BEWARE it is boring! And it is also hard to understand!"
5,Oh Monsieur Lorry!,"I hate when people degrade this novel because they expect in their little buttercup-brains that Lucie Manette is going to have a musket-fight with Mme. Defarge or Alexander Manette will murder Lucie...it's an historical novel. And like all classics, they became classics because they showed insight into the human nature and soul. The first two books develop the plot and help the readers to develop and love or hate the characters, through a slow pace. In the third book, Charles Dickens makes a point of looking into human nature with his world-famous magnifying glass and wraps up all the plots. The pace picks up and we figure out what loyalty is. I am absolutely positive that the only part that these foo-foo heads like was when Ms. Pross beats up Mme. Defarge."
4,Not as good as nook version,"I have a Nook and a kindle keyboard.This book is free on both these two book stores.If you have purchased a Nook version ,you will find it is much better than this one."
3,A Tale of Two Cities,"My granddaughter selected this for me, as she was helping me become acquainted with Kindle, which was a Christmas gift from my daughter."
2,Ok...,Downloaded because I remembered reading this in school & wanted to refresh my memory of what it was about - I don't like how it was written...the language is too hard to follow.
4,ATale of Two Cities is one of the Best Classics I have ever Read.,"This is such a very good story, it is so hard to read at first, and then you don't want to put it down, Amazing Writer. I would recommend this to everyone."
4,As good as I remember,"I read this in high school, reread it a few weeks ago on kindle, while the experience was different, the story and dialogue still held and hit on a different level."
3,Mildly entertaining,"One of the great ironies of the universe is that better books are written and not as largely known. Never the less tthis book does manage to entertain, but it is little else. The most interesting parts deal with the historical back ground of the novel. It's faults are little characterization(Lucy Manette had no personality), melodramatic, and it is overlong. It isn't a waste of time, but you'd be better off with Kipling or Twain or Bradbury or any other great writer."
5,Brilliant!,"As so many of the reviews seem to center around Dickens' style, I will say this: it is, as nineteenth-century books often are, somewhat semantically complex, but a careful reading and accesible dictionary should remedy any problems this might cause. Though the basic plot flags at times, it is on the whole quite admirable. What elevates it to excellence, however, is the ending--the climax is one of the most stirring, evocative, and absolutely brilliant scenes I have ever read."
3,Kindle download,"Haven't read it yet, but I've always meant to do so. Having it on the Kindle app on my iPad will make it easy to read."
3,hard to understand,this book is hard to understand at first but if you read it multiple times then it makes sense .
5,A Book I've Always Loved!,"This is the second book I downloaded onto my Kindle. I read this originally some twenty-plus years ago. It is a story that I've alway loved both in the written form and in film. To me this is the best book that Dickens ever wrote and is far better than Great Expectations and the other such stories we were forced to read in High School decades ago. It might be because of the subject matter and the greater focus on the historical events than in some of his other books, that has held my interest, as I love history, but regardless of why it grabs me, I believe it is a timeless classic and I highly recommend it."
2,hard read,wouldn't have read it if I had not known the story linetoo much description of people and placesgreat story though
5,It's on my desert island list,One of the most inspiring (and educational) stories of all time. I have never forgotten Sydney Carton and the sacrifice he makes. His final words moved me to tears. This is a masterpiece.
3,My Bucket Reading List,"Have heard of the book for much of my 73 years, but knew nothing other than it was a ""classic.""So, I'm plowing through it, but feel it takes about 3 pages of reading to try to discern what's going on, if even then. I'm going to finish it, but can only tolerate about 1/2 hour each night. The old prose is baffling and gets in the way. However, I must admit experiencing how Dickens used words and apparently thought in these sentence structures is interesting. Also, my Kindle so far has not failed to come up with a meaning for all the words he uses that I've never heard of. I also signed on for the free audio version and still need to try that - perhaps it's easier to listen to than actually reading it. Hopefully in the end, I will be able to see the big picture of all the characters and be the wiser for my efforts."
2,Too boring.,I wanted to try the classics but then when I started reading I found out that they weren't for me. If you are interested in the classics than you would enjoy.
3,"It was a waste of time, It was a great use of time","I think that I just don't like Dickens. A wit, maybe to some. A sharp sense of humor maybe some think so. A barometer of the times that he lived in, could be but give me Mark Twain or John Steinbeck all day over Dickens.."
1,timeless classic wrought w/ mistakes (publisher review),"The back cover does not match ""look inside"" picture - I received a condensed version of Dickens' story consisting only of train/mistress story. Last line: ""His affair with Nellly eventually cost his his marriage."" Their typos, not mine.Title heading on every page inside reads ""A Tail of Two Cities."" Once again, their mistake (spelling), not mine.So what else is wrong with this printing? I don't know this book well enough to risk finding out...Also there is no publishing page in the book - is this a legal copy?"
1,Beware if this is to be read for high school English classes,Please note that this is not the original Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens - it is RETOLD by Lucinda Dickens Hawksley. English teachers will not accept this version for use in their classes. The Amazon photo and description is misleading. Now I get to buy the original version - hopefully it gets here before the class starts to read it. Anyone want to purchase a new RETOLD version of A Tale of Two Cities?
4,A true love story....,I was forced to read this book in accelerated english during my freshman year of high school and I hated it with every fibber of my being. Later I when back and reread the book and afterwards I had a whole new perspective of the story. I realized that this is an epic story filled with love and loss. I would recommend this book to more advanced readers because the story is written in old english so parts of it are more or less impossible to read (seriously... the first paragraph of the story is one sentence!) This novel details the lives of the nobles and peasants in both England and France in the time leading up to the French revolution. In the time since I have never forgotten the touching and memorable characters.
5,Masterpiece of Fiction,"Charles Dickens was a master and this book was one of his best. It is a departure from some of his other works which have a lot in common with each other. A Tale of Two Cities is a mystery, a spy thriller, a history, a tragedy, and a love story all rolled into one. It also happens to have the best opening lines and the best ending lines of any novel. As with any classic like this, the language and writing are not what the modern ear is used to hearing so may be a little difficult for those who are new to that. It will be well worth your time to read this book though. It will put you through a roller coaster of emotions right up to the very end. Highly recommended."
2,"I did not enjoy the book, nor did I find it informative.","""A Tale of Two Cities"" is tedious and time consuming. While many people say that it has plenty of action, Dickens spends too much time in description for it to be truly enjoyable. The language is too grand for most audiences today, but this is understandable. What is not understandable is the lack of life put into the words. Certainly the book is somewhat realistic, but it lacks realism. Too many characters maintain their high ideals in a time that is essentially war and chaos. I would not, under any circumstances reccommend this book to either an adult or a child."
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS!,My teacher made me download this and I never got past the first chapter. It's really really really really boring. at least it's free though.
1,Get a life,"Boring book, he doesn't know how to get to point. It takes him two chapters to get someone up a hill."
2,Just purchased,I have always wanted to read this book but haven't started it yet. Not fair to rate it yet. Later.
4,Think 18th century soap-opera with a dash of espionage,"This book starts off slowly. The first impression I had of this book was that it was boring. Then more characters are introduced, and more plot twists come about. The story is about a 18th century English family that get intangled in a conspiracy. It also follows a French wine shop owner who has a grudge against her families murderer. If you like espionage, love stories and historical fiction books then this is the book for you. This book spreds many genres of literature and has a little bit of everything from each. Strongly recommended."
3,Weak Characterization- Decent Plot,"The Characters in this novel are very weak. They certainly are not explored enough for anyone to be sympathetic towards any one in the book. So therefore, the strong point would have to be plot. There are marvelous moments in the story, particularly the ending, which will provide any reader with an adreniline rush. In my opinion, though, there are far too many aspects of the story that drone on with no purpose."
5,A Great Dickens Novel,"This book is great! I had to read it for English class, and I am so glad because it was a great book! Many people say it is not good because the beginning is boring and sometimes mysterious so you're like, ""What's going on?"" But if you read it through to the end, the ending is great and clarifies all. It jusifies the sometimes boring parts. Have fun reading!"
4,For anyone interested in The French Revolution.,"I tend to divide Dickens' work into two fields - the straightforward novels, and the socially relevant ones. This belongs in the latter category, which means it is slightly less fun to read. However, the worst novel by Dickens is better then most author's best. This is a great work and when I think of The French Revolution and The Reign of Terror, it is A Tale of Two Cities that I usually imagine. Also, it contains two of the most famous passages in all of literature: ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..."" and ""It is a far, far better thing I do now than I have ever done..."" It is a great novel to be sure, but it should not be your INTRODUCTION to Dickens."
4,Magnificently Intresting!!,"It was very wonderful and easy to get in to. It has some surprises, which everyone likes!"
4,what a great book!,"I first read this book in high school, and only half-heartedly, like so many things I did in high school. I'm 40 now, and have just finished reading the novel again. It's a very compelling and exciting story. Dicken's prose is beautifully poetic. And the novel's a tear-jerker! I missed that somehow when I was 17."
4,This book was difficult to at times but good plot,This is one of Dicken's finest works of writing. It diplicted the French revolution tremedously. Many the chapters were hard to understand but with a good english teacher like Mrs. Lee (Fort Morgan Colorado) I found it to have a great plot. When I was finished with the book looking back on it I realized what a great job dicken's did forshadowing the book and using great detail and repition to get main points across. Themes of the book though written a very long time ago still apply to life today. The only things I really disliked about the book was that it was drwan out and had at times too much info that was not nessicary. This was a great book and everyone should read it just to see a new style of writing.
5,Tale of two cities,I studied this as a set book at the same time as studying the French Revolution at school. Loved it then...and still now....The thing with classics: They stand the test of time.
3,"pretty good book, worth looking into",ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok and it was free so not too bad
4,Glimpse into Paris and London in the 1700's.,This is the first adult version of Dickens' I have read. Beautifully written. But I must confess to preferring a faster paced story. Feltlike forever before any real action took place. Loved the glimpse into the events surrounding the French Revolution.
4,Glad I finally read it,It took almost 2 months but I finally read the book in its entirely. Not the best book IN have ever read but a very good book with many quotable passages
3,Cities,Very difficult to understand. Butt I do know a man pays dearly in the end for a crime he did. Wont give it away.Very long..... Hard to follow for me. Guess it may just be me. Read it if you want a long book.
4,Tale of Two Cities,Have had this on my to read list a long time and finally got it done. It isn't something I would normally read but i am still glad I did. It was a real challenge for me to get through. It is a good classic but not for every one.A Tale of Two Cities
4,Love It,"Add me to the long list of fans of this book. I first read it in high school and have re-read it over the years and always find new things within it. This is not my favorite classic, but it comes close."
4,Classic,"If you haven't read this book yet, you should seriously consider reading it. While the first two chapters or so are slow going because they're filling you in on the setting and the characters, the plot quickly picks up and makes you want more. I will say this though, the first time i read this book was in the 10th grade and I predicted the ending before I was even halfway through the book (in other words, it was very predictable)."
4,This review has no title,"How do you describe a classic other than to explain the writing? How do you explain the writing without having to explain the upsetting circumstances surrounding the characters involved?The last part is easy, as is the case with the classics, most know already that A Tale of Two Cities is set in the time of the French Revolution. It begins in good times, but ends on the opposite end of the spectrum, while still finding a way to give hope to those turning the pages of history.There are visuals within these pages that will touch any reader, clear and beautiful in their wording. However, in keeping with the dual nature of things, there are also visuals that will touch the reader holding the sadness and horror of what had come about during the time of multiple executions.Life changes for many this book touches, that includes those holding it in their hands."
1,Absolute rip off,"I ordered this, then later found at Sams club same maker (Coffee mate), but liquid form of hazelnut cream. This is 35 server per bottle times 6 equals 210 serving. The one at Samsclub is 300 serving for about $7. This is $23 something. This is a big rip off. Do not buy this. You are over paying 5 times.How about the taste? I like hazelnut coffee since buying coffee from Wawa. This hazelnut is nowhere close to Wawa's cream. I think it's mostly cream, and light in hazelnut.I don't recommend you on this product, and please save your money.Amazon shipped this super quick though, and A+ for Amazon as usual."
5,Amazing,"This is absolutely wonderful. My grocery store doesn't have it so when I saw it on the AMAZING Amazon, I ordered it. I have ordered it ever since and will continue."
2,Your product photo and description do NOT match. I thought I was receiving SUGAR FREE as the photo shows!,"Incorrect photo of product, shows SUGAR FREE but rather they ship you regular... sad day for a diabetic but a good price for someone who can use it... just not me."
4,Delivering Fire,"As Prometheus gifted us with fire Messrs. Niven and Pournelle, ever the consumate collaborators, bring us into a world where magic refuses to die and the gods themselves can be held to answer for their acts. Perhaps Science Fiction's most creative team and certainly ranked amongst the greatest for their individual contributions, the Larry and Jerry act again bring us novelty and continuity in their ""Lordshills"" series."
3,Fun time waster,"High school mismatched couple drift away after high school in 1967. She's a nice Jewish girl who went to collage. He's an Italian boy who goes to Florida to lip-synch to Sinatra (his ""hero"") songs in a club. But they still think of each other often.It was okay. I like the 60s and Springsteen music. The plot and acting was just fair but not a bad film to waste time watching."
2,not good >:-/,"this is like a preview of a cd from tiffany nicole. but the actual cd never came out. anyway they are 3 very very old fashion - not very enjoyable songs. ""Just a Girl"" is probably the best song of the three, but not worth it anyway."
4,Excellent historical value,"Excellent book, voyageur poems of wonderful value. The french accent/written as pronounced was a bit difficult to read at times but overall worth the $$."
3,"Great concept, but not enough depth to fill it out","I bought this book because it joins two of my loves: perfume (and how it is created) and travel. However, as another reviewer noted, the book repeats much of the same things over and over again, but not consistently (ironically!). Words and concepts are mentioned well before they are explained. Historical context, statements, and notes are thrown in here and there, but in places where they don't ""fit"". Maybe one section, up front, to delve into the history, then another about processing operations, would be useful before the author starts traveling. Also, more description about the areas where the ingredients are grown/harvested, and how those people depend on the livelihood, would have fleshed the book out more. Some observations end up being shallow. As it is, it's not very in-depth. Still an interesting read, and her inclusion and interviews of some top fragrance developers (Lutens, Fragonard) was an excellent idea."
2,Haven't read it so............,"Take my opinion as such. But I noticed in the first pages that the author mentions gathering musk from musk deer as not harming the animals. They scrape it out of their scrotums.I'm quite interested in perfume, but I don't like people who see the world as a giant picnic table. I got that impression from this woman and it turned me off.Fascinating subject otherwise. Think I'll wait for another book though."
1,"SAP SD Interview Questions, Answers, and Explanations",This book is a wate of time and money. I will not recommend this to anyone. This book is not worth publishing. The questions are vauge and some times incomplete. The book space is wated by using double spacing and big fonts - even then only half a page is filled with one question incomplete answer and no explanation. In reality this is a 25 page book.Total waste of money.
2,Ehhhhhhhhhhh,Not worth anything close to price. At best a 10-15 dollar book. Thank god the job payed for it.
1,Waste of time and Money,"Will not recommend this book at all.I was preparing for interview so decide to invest on this book, but i am very disapointed.Contains very basic questiosn, which are not asked in real world interviews. (speaking from experience).Pocket size book which cotains hardly any thing important.Please don't waste you time and money on this."
3,sap sd,I received this book before the promised date and it was in superb condition. will definitely buy goods from this seller as he is very reliable.
5,A Thoughtful Damn,"This really is a marvelous book--full of all the details and asides that you don't get to read elsewhere. I found it amusing as well as informative. The author, Dr. Russo, clearly knows his subject--and shares his knowledge in a very entertaining way."
4,worth to watch..,"good dvd for physio or health professionals to improve basic skill of orthopedicsdescribed simply, good 3D view, it's worth to watch for studying physio.."
2,Underwhelming screwball comedy,"The Bottom Line:A movie that seems contrived and forced (even within the very generous bounds of the screwball comedy) and one that doesn't conclude so much as just end, Woman Chases Man has a couple of chuckles sprinkles throughout but really has nothing to distinguish itself or warrant a viewing.2/4"
5,Excellent Research,"I recently re-read this book, after seeing the authors sitting in Tom Hank's bus in the Da Vinci Code movie. It really is a superb piece of historical investigation. Shame the public didn't catch on to this one instead of Dan Brown's rip off. The key point of the book is that the real indentity of Christ, as far as the Knights Templar and other heretical groups were concerned, was not Jesus, but John the Baptist. The implication being that they could not have been as interested in protecting the so-called bloodline of Jesus as the Holy Blood, Holy Grail writers have suggested. The only down side to the book is that they get lost in Isis-Osiris speculation half way through it, and are at a loss to explain the significance of Mary Magdalene to the heretical tradition."
1,Trash,"What a bunch of baloney! Do these people have no awareness of how ridiculous they appear? Look, just read Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco."
4,"Alot of information, lots to think about.","I couldn't put this book down and it seemed to go on forever. It is loaded with information, much of it new to me. I found the whole Jesus, Mary Magdaline, John the Baptist political rivlary senario very interesting. I also found the Black Madonna cult research quite facinating.One thing that kept popping up for me as I read the book was a sense of anger from the author. I'm not sure what that was about but it was mildly unsettleing."
3,Another In A Long Series,"If you have any knowledge of the Templar, Rennes Le Chateau tale, there is nothing new here except more speculation - some of it well-founded and entertaining. I find the Templar mystery intriguing but this will probably be the last book I buy on the subject as I'm loosing interest in the end game of the theories.I fear that the ""shocking"" world-changing secret of the Templars would just replace one theological fairy tale/myth with another and be received as pretty ho-hum.It would be like folks saying, ""All these years we have been worshiping the Easter Bunny and it turns out that Rudolf the Reindeer was actually messiah and redeemer. We have to restore Rudolf's decendants to the throne of France so they can rule the world with divine authority. This 21st Century man asks, ""So what?"" Like its going to happen?-Greg Forest"
1,Fiction 1; Scholarship 0,"A fine example of the growing illiteracy in this land, Picknett and Prince declaim at length with neither proof nor documentation. We are expected to take their word about numerous events and accept their interpretations of various actions. They provide much interesting fiction, but present it as possible fact. This book is a complete waste of time and money. In a sensible age, this trash would be published at the authors' expense. To paraphrase the great Jon Carroll, this is the sort of tripe you read if you read this sort of tripe. I tried to give it zero stars, but the imbecile programmer won't let me."
2,Speculative but fun.,"This book should not be read as a serious history book, but rather as a fun conspiracy theory, for all those intriguing blanks in ""official"" history. The lack of serious scholarship is most clearly seen when examining the notes, which are supposed to lend the work an air of credibility. But when they reference supposed historical facts to ""as told in conversation"" with so-called experts, the whole argument falters. The templar bit is ironically the least convincing, as several dodgy sources are cited. The part about jesus being an egyptian sex-magician is fun though.Summa summarum; read it at your leisure, but do so with a critical eye. In fact, read instead the ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"", which has more facts, more fun, and almost as whacky and incoherent conclusions."
2,"Conjecture, Claims, Leaps of Imagination, Silliness","The authors must have been paid by the word.It is not sensational or new or compelling. It is a pop faux history book with some rather thrilling leaps of imagination and conclusions. It is a dull rehearsal of a fascinating topic.Still, it is worthwhile in that it challenges us to examine what true Christian history might mean. Don't expect much in the form of real conclusive history here and you won't be disappointed. Even more tedious than Holy Blood Holy Grail.Not recommended."
2,Rationalised Theories,"I purchased this book whilst in London, and believe it to be a rather amusing and quite cleverly written book. The messages it conveys, in my opinion, are cunningly sketched, as are the rationalised theories, which for me, have too many holes in them to actually believe. Decide for yourselves.Prior to reading this book, one ought to have their foundation in ancient/Templar history sorted, especially when it comes to the Blue Apples. For it is quite easy to be swayed into another's perspective, especially if one has minimal information on the subject at hand. Again, one must decide.***The Truth speaks to many of us in different ways, and is not always found in the written word, or the research of others."
2,Masonic mumbo jumbo...........,"This book is a lot of fun but generaly contains a series of mis-matched facts and stories. If you liked 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' then you should enjoy this book too.The conclusion is interesting and very funny. It seems like the authors have strung together all this mysterious secret mens business info to argue the following :1. Established religion does not care for the modern female and her rights2. There is a long standing western mystery traditionBoth facts that are well known by most people but its seems that Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince had to spend 8 years researching and travelling around Europe before they could discover these profound revelations.Upshot is that its a lot of fun but best read like a Sunday paper - skim through and don't take it too seriously."
3,Unconvincing but interesting,"The authors of this book claim they didn't start their research with any pre-conceived opinions but they do seem to have made some rather big leaps in logic. They refer to the New Testament, as we know it, as propaganda written and included in the canon to create the Christian belief system as it has been handed down to us. There may be some truth to that statement but they seem more than willing to quote from it when it serves their purpose. Many of their ""revelations"" are not new, such as Jesus' relationship with Mary Magdalene, but the theory that Christianity has it's roots in ancient Egyptian religion was new, at least to me.All of that being said, I actually enjoyed the book even though the evidence presented for the ""revelations"" is less than convincing. It did cause me to re-evaluate the evidence on which I base my own belief system and that is something we should all do from time to time."
4,Interesting theories,"The authors have spent countless hours doing their research. Their conclusions are well-documented and startling to any Christian who should read this book. It is not for everyone, but for people interested in esoteric and academic examination of the secret societies, it is a fascinating read."
2,The Revelations inside The Templar Revelation,"Typical of similar books that promise a lot but reveal little. Lots of information relating to religion, free masonry, etc., but it revealed no real purpose of the Knights Templar group or any significant accomplishments. This is not surprising since much of the information was about religion, at best a myth and at the worst a terrible imposition on human progress... just as it is today. Not a book to keep as a reference or to ever read again."
2,Bites off more than it can chew,"The book reads fast but like most psuedo-conspiratorial literature of its kind it gets imprecise. The New Testament is relied on when beneficial to their argument, but other parts are dismissed as fabrication. I find it hard to pick and choose as they did; thus as a whole I am sceptical of most of their conclusions. Also, themes that were important in the beginning of the book (i.e. the role of Mary Magdalene) tend to lose their weight as the book ends (if she was important to Jesus, and Jesus is not who the world thinks, why is she still important - it's hard to discuss without revealing spoilers!). In this vein, why is it so vital for the Priory to guard the lineage it guards? Had they addressed these and other contradicitons the book would have been too long and less compelling.Overall, the book was entertaining - a fun bit of subversion for Templar hunters."
2,Revelation?,"If you like reading fiction then this book might be for you. You must remember that the book contains distortions, deceptions and outright fantasy. It seems as though it might be a good way to make money.....the author got mine (for the last time)"
1,Go one better...,"Go one better and read a book by about the constructing of texts like this one: Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum"" , which although ostensibly a novel, contains more reliable facts than this text (I'm not being sarcastic! Eco works in so much non-fiction that one reviewer said the novel needed an index!) and does not pretend to be non-fiction. Eco's format allows much more scope for exploration of the issues of this genre beyond the mere construction of theories of conspiracy and revisionism and succeeds in entertaining, informing, and above all not taking itself too seriously!"
2,Another hard to read book by over used vocabulary Phds.,Why do historial or scientific writers feel they have to use the biggest words they can find in their books? I'm an educated man and I had to stop at least twice every page to look up words in the dictionary. I don't feel like doing this for the entire book.Most of the heavy words could have easily been substituted with single word replacements. I can use a thesaurus to find the biggest word to use too... I just choice not to in my writtings so readers can enjoy and understand rather than trying to show them how educated and well versed I am.My overall review is that this book would have been much more enjoyable if egos didn't get in the way of the topic being illustrated.
1,Garbage,"Interesting subject matter for sure. Nevertheless, when you make so many leaps, you have to start to wonder why nobody else reaches the conclusion these guys do.I wonder how much the authors' perceived hatred for catholicism jaded their research. My guess is quite a bit.After writing this review, I suspect some of the brainless sycophants out there who take one snippet of information and exclude the rest (like the authors), will now find my review ""unhelpful"". That's great--no big deal, but maybe ask yourself why is it that these two individuals, who can't read ancient greek or aramic, or hebrew, are suddenly able to seize upon the conclusions that have been missing from the world for 2000 years? Because they are as selective in their research as the church was at editing the bible."
3,Umm! What can I say...,"I can't help getting the impression that after writing Turin Shroud: In Whose Image (which I have not read...nor I think I would want to), the authors had some leftover material. And they were holidaying in the South of France anyhow...okay, so I'm being a bit cynical here. Then again I really did not gain much new information or ideas from this book. To be more specific: not the best written book I've come across - rather repetitive and not too inspiring; tells the same old story of the Grail and the legends of the Merovingian dynasty; etc. I found it took some effort to finish reading the book. Personally, I found a bit too much time was spent on the feminine principle - with the authors attempting to use this to explain a connection with a whole lot - IMHO not very convincingly."
1,A frustration,"By the time I reached page 106 of this book, my frustration with the authors and their suppositions, caused my interest level to drop to zero."
5,THIS STARTS REPLACING INFO WIPED OUT BY INQUSITIONS!!!,"You can't expect authors just relearning this story to get all the sources the first time round, but these authors have done pretty well. If you will check out all their sources, plus Manley Hall, Dr. Karen Ralls, Jean Markale, Karen King and all their ""sources"", you will fine there is plenty of info to back up this ""alternate theology"" story. The Inquisitions obviously didn't happen for no reason. Onward and upward, equality, liberty and fraternity and a respect for the Oneness in the Universe@!@!!!"
3,...,"well, when one read this book it seems like a great work of scholarship. However, if the reader researches claims made by the author, he realizes that they twisted some facts to suit their ends and support their conclusion.This book is of the 'holy blood holy grail' (which is much better than this)genre.Anyways, I give it 3 stars because you do learn many facts and it is a very interesting and entertaining read.from a 14 year old...."
3,Worth a read,"This book could be thought of as an update to Holy Blood, Holy Grail. Much has come to light since HBHG was first published. This book does a good job of bringing us up to date. They bring some newly-discovered items to light as well.The authors have their particular theories, everyone seems to have their own. They make their case just as strongly as those with differing viewpoints makes theirs. Somewhere in there lies the truth. We just have to keep on searching.This is recommended as a good addition to anyone's library or reading list concerning Rennes-le-Chateau, Mary Magdalene, Jesus, etc.Guy"
4,The Templar Revelation,"While i agree with Mr. nomo23, a reviewer who sounds very learned, about the pettiness between authors, I found the book very intriguing. It brough to light alot I didn't know about the dead sea scrolls, and Madonna worship among other things. However, I wonder just how far some things were 'stretched' to make a point at times during the book. I also must agree with one of the other 'Reviewers' that it DOES tend to leave you feeling 'beaten up' at times, as well as seeming to be 2 different books..the first 1/3rd and last 2/3rds. Over all, I'd still recommend it as a good read for anyone with an open mind, and curiosity."
2,"Engaging, yet not very convincing","I totally enjoyed reading this book. It provides an engaging and interesting perspective on Christianity and, as other reviewers have pointed out, turns our culture today upside down.While it is interesting however to imagine the world if that theory was true, the book definitely does not have the authority to do that. Poor research, unattributed STRONG statements, sources that are as valid as ""a secret newsletter distributed on the streets of Paris in 1890."" At some passages of teh book I felt insulted by the authors for failing to support their conclusionms by evidence or by using their own assumptions as evidence."
5,When did Jesus live? Revelations...,"Outstanding... It stirred my imagination and I felt very enthusiastic about it... until I found a book by a Russian mathematician Fomenko who, in his book ""History: Fiction or Science"" claims that the history we are taught in school, and that is considered as basic knowledge is... false, including the story of J.C., ! I really recommend reading the two to gain a better understanding of history and chronology."
3,"Interesting, but....","Actually an interesting book, *but* - read the Hiram Key for an alternate and maybe more accurate history of the templars."
1,Would have made a good X-File episode,"I was completely disapointed in this book. It is a work of fiction which tries very hard to appear objective. While some of the research is interesting, the premises are so far fetched, and full of holes that the conclusions lack any plausibility whatsoever. The authors will take bits and pieces of information, weave them together with ""perhaps"" and ""this could be an indication of.."", or ""one might assume"" and then use these ""facts"" to form the foundation of even more theories and hypothesis. The faith required to beleive anything in this book is exponentially higher than the faith required to believe the book it tries to refute - the Bible. If you are looking for a work of fiction and if you can completely suspend your disbelief while reading, you may find it interesting. However, if you are looking for some factual evidence against the Bible, you won't find it here."
1,"Gross inaccuracies, a ""con"" job!","The book is full of unproven suppositions. They make a poorly proven case for a point in one chapter, then in the next, they allude to it as ""as we have proven previously"". Most of their""revelations"" are such: Poorly proven.One example: They say the ""Gospel Of Mary"" refers to Mary Magdalene, and say it says so. They don't provide the quote. Well, I HAVE a copy of the Gospel Of Mary, and it clearly states it was wriiten by Mary, wife of Joseph, mother of JEsus.This is only one example of shoddy research writing. They fail to prove any of their points in the book, in fact they should make a discerning reader very skeptical!"
3,So-so,"There are some good tunes on this album, but it doesn't have the textural depth of Born Sandy Devotional. A bit more run of the mill, but would be a great source for cover tunes."
4,Some people do what they like,"And Robert Palmer did indeed do that.This album was released in 1976 after pressure drop.It rather good lp by robert some tracks I don't likethats just me. overall I give it and 8.9Robert did what he wanted without question in the70' and 80'sHow many artists can say that now of these daysand stay with record comapany for 1974 to 1985thats 11 yrs . Back in those days,record companies gave out long contractsto new artists. in the late 80's if the recordif sells you stay,if it don't your out.The cd is really over priced it's not msfl goldcd . This cd came out on cd in 1989- 1990My version is island masters sound is great for back then.Finding this can be hard? but check ebay international sitesyour sure to find one, as i did for just, $10.00"
5,Solves some mysteries,Creative Pottery offers pictoral demonstrations for pieces distinctive to several accomplished potters. Its a great resource for discovery and will aid in the development of a potter's own unique expression.
5,"Well written, beautiful photos, I hope there'll be more","Michael (please note correct spelling of Michael, it is NOT Micheal) is NOT the illustrator of Michelle's book.Michael Coakes IS an outstanding illustrator in his own right, but NOT the illustrator of his sister's book."
3,Never Without Ringo,"The skinny on the new release is that it rocks harder than Vertical Man but its songwriting is not quite as strong, close but not as memorable. The Harrison tribute stands out and should be heard by all Fab fans everywhere. Far and away, the strongest cut on the disc. No writers have commented yet about the last (hidden) throwaway track wherein Ringo plays ALL of the instruments himself - a highlight which should be a lot longer. And hats off to that out-of-left-field jazzy middle eight with Charlie Haden on bass! (When will Ringo cut a sequel to Sentimental Journey?)Is Ringo back? Did he ever really go away? Is the title Ringorama as in ""Futurama"" or as in ""Ringo Rama, Ringo Rama, Rama Rama, Ringo Ringo"" - the ultimate (hidden) Harrison tribute?"
3,It don't come easy,"Ringo is just okay in this endeavor unless you think he is wonderful regardless of his feeble attempts to recreate the magic of George, Paul and John. I am not saying that he is bad, just that he falls far short of the solo efforts of the other three. And, unless you are a fanatical Ringo fan, save your money and skip the enhanced DVD version as the DVD is lame. There is is nothing stirring on this album and you can better spend your money on George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, or any of the many Beatles albums."
3,"Drumming's great, but I can't give Ringo four stars...","I just can't take his singing for an entire record.This is his best drumming ever, though. Great chops, Rich!!And at 63 no less!! Shows that you can improve on your instrument with age. Ringo's been practicing...you can tell!"
5,A fantastic album,"This is just wonderful. Great songs, great performance, great production. Ringo's best album apart from Ringo (1973) and very nearly as good as that. Not only is it better than most of his other albums, it is also better than most of the other post-Beatles albums by John, Paul and George."
5,"Don't look past this one! Superb songs, artistry, sound, arangments, and voice.","This ranks as one of the best post Beatle's albums to date; either by John, Paul, George, or Ringo. And INSTANT AMNESIA is the best Rockin' tune for sure. One can listen to it over and over and still hear something new and exciting. The lowest ranking song is WRITE TO ME only becuase Willie Nelson's singing isn't that great (what else is new). The rest of the songs are five stars. Ringo gets excellent help from Dean Grakal, Gary Burr, Mark Hudson, Barbara Starkey, and Steve Dudas in every song on this collection. In an interview while making this album, Ringo claims that he had the other musicians recorded the songs while in one small room. He says he believes playing togther while recording is better than in seperate rooms and by overlaying tracks. With this recordings I agree. The feel and sound of a collection of professional rockers and artist comes through. Way to go RINGO!"
5,Another Great One!,"Ringo's on a role. I feel his last five releases have been outstanding. It's too bad the DJ's don't feel the same way. These songs deserve to be heard. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. It's great fun...and while you're at it, order Ringo's last four efforts as well. You won't be sorry."
1,Utter Garbage,"Like McCartney, Ringo proves the theory that multi-millionaires have literally nothing of value to say, since saying or not saying it makes no difference to them.Full of stillborn attempts at Rock, Pop, and Special Guests a-plenty, Ringorama lacks any RingoDrama, and probably won't be of any value to anyone except Ringo apologists and yer RingoGramma."
5,ringo still rockin,"just listened to ringo's latest cd 'ringorama' and i have to say it's a very strong album - possibly the best beatle solo album since double fantasy. Ringo's drumming is superb as always and his voice sounds as if he hasn't aged a day. The best tracks are the more modern ""Eye to Eye"", ""Missouri Loves Company"", ""Instant Amnesia"" (which sounds like it could have been on the white album) and the great tribute to george ""never without you"". ""Imagine me there"" is a beautiful ballad with a great solo by Clapton, and the duet with willie nelson works some magic. All in all, a must have for any Beatles fan. And the bonus DVD has great footage of the making of the album. It's very funny."
4,Mark Hudson is a Genius,"Aside from being talented and witty, Ringo is also one smart cookie for having asked Mark Hudson to produce Verticle Man and now RingoRama...you don't spend as many years in the biz as has Ringo without knowing genius when you see it...Mark has managed to paint an audible canvas of colors in this album...blending artists together the way a painter choses hues...Ringo is supported in his vision by the best players in the business in a retro-fashion as well as with fresh new sounds...""I Think, Therefore, I Rock and Roll"" is the next one to chart from this CD...MARK my words...If you want a summertime romp on CD that will sustain you year around...get this...the DVD is a must-have as well...and for fans of Mr. Hudson, it's worth the price just to see him in a kilt (wink)...VibeGirl"
1,A low blow,"First, if you haven't already picked up Ringo Rama, DO SO! Especially this deluxe edition. You won't be sorry. Why only 1 star? Well, as an earlier reviewer explained, this is the second time within 1 year that this album has been released and us Beatle people are feeling mighty taken advantage of. I'd never heard any of the three new tracks until I heard ""Blink"" in a music store today. It's a really good song, and I immediately headed right over to the Ringo section (yes, some stores still have Ringo sections!!) of the CD rack. Then I saw the price.Sorry, Ringo, but as George said, ""You can lead a horse to water ...""And Mark, if you read these reviews ... how could you, a huge Beatles fan, allow this to happen? Did you have any say in the matter? What's wrong with a less pricey EP?No wonder some people download."
5,Outstanding!!!,"This is the Ringo CD we've all been waiting for!!!TIME TAKES TIME was good, but this is a masterpiece. ""Eye to Eye,"" ""Instant Amnesia,"" and ""I Think Therefore I Rock and Roll"" are among Ringo's best work. Good hard rock and roll. It's no wonder Ringo seems so proud on the DVD--his drumming is truly outstanding (what a sound!) and his singing beyond anything you'd expect. I've been playing it over and over and over and simply don't get tired of it...Kudos to producer Mark Hudson and the rest of the musicians, who play with raunchy finesse and really seem to be enjoying themselves.DJ's out there--please, listen up and play this!!! (And not just the Harrison tribute song!).GMK"
2,not like the picture,The item is not shaped like the figure in the description and it doesn't work asw well as it should to protect the feeder from intrusion by rodents.
4,Like his outlook on life,"His positive approach represents one who hasn't forgotten the basic ABC's of life; care, share, love, enjoy, etc.As an icon of success, he portrays a down-to-earth perspective on the outlook of life and the challenges it presents.Nice book to curl up and read."
2,"good history, poor visuals","Firstly, it should be noted that this film was shot about twenty years ago, long before the restoration of the Louvre. This video gives an interesting overview of the Louvre's history, but spends disappointingly little time on the art. The lighting for much of the art shots is very poor, and the angles make it difficult to see. Much precious film time is wasted on viewing spectators instead of the building and its contents. A good view if you would enjoy the historical background of this wonderful building, but as one who has been there, a disappointing view of it's architecture and treasures."
5,Really good,"I have all the Jarvis Collection and this one is very good, as are they all. Especially the part about how the Louvre outwitted the Nazis. Well done."
4,"Good history of the Louvre and France, disappointing art tour","I do not consider the description accurate, as I would expect a ""tour of one of the world's great art galleries"" to mostly allow one to view the art of the museum. But it is mostly a history of the building. I did find the history very interesting, so I did enjoy it. But I wish it had focused more on the art. The few paintings it showed were only on screen for a brief moment (of course you can pause to view longer) and very little information was provided about the paintings. If you are interested in the history of the Louvre as a building and France's history you will enjoy it. If you want to see quality images of the art of the Louvre you may be disappointed. Also, this was originally filmed in 1978 so the quality is reflective of that time."
2,Bit too simple,"A bit too simplistic for the HS physics student. This book, instead, seems more aimed towards pre-HS students seeking a healthy head-start on physics concepts w/o being innundated w/ physics problem sets or mathematical equations and confusion. A small glimpse of the concept w/ emphasis on practical applications clearly present physics in a earnest manner to readers. Serves home-schooled students extremely well."
3,Good but not my cup of tea,"Along with his 1995 release ""THE EXPERIMENTAL GUITAR SERIES VOLUME 1: THE GUITAR AS ORCHESTRA"" Belew goes all-out with his guitar synthesizer. The results are intersting but not overly entertaining to me. I find this works best as part of a mix rather that as a disc on it's own where the sonics wear on me. Interstingingly, the CD release doesn't include ""Joan Miro's Procession Through the Insides of a Purple Antelope Across a Sea of Tuna Fish"" which is available on the compilation ""Desire Of The Rhno King""."
3,A disappointment....,"After hearing the first three track of this cd on the radio so many times, I had to get the cd. The first few track are fun, and well done. A few other songs are neat, but then there are some where you just wonder, ""what on earth!"". I was a bit suprised with the cd. The tracks, fulana, the fulana mix, and others. I expected this cd to be pura salsa, pura muscia. The first few songs are, and they are best for dancing, a few others are a little of the beaten path. Gilberto is a talented salsero, having a few other cds where he is featured, and I hope he continues to make the whole world dance. Although this is the first cd I have of his (completely), I was shocked, therefore, i cannot give it the rating that it deserves."
3,Better-than-movie DVD jacket,"The best friends love the same female. She got married Joseph, a first who confessed and proposed leaving an open space for Frank.The rest of a friends' circle exchange their spouses and partners either while not avoiding same gender quickies sometimes.Well, this work leaves really a broad room for further explorations the characters might be enjoy in the future."
4,Moments of genius,"This is a good movie, but the final 15 minutes are almost pure genius. the story comes to an emotional head, with some great dialogue, and superb acting, but Tarantino nearly steals the show with his cameo. Ever wondered why Top Gun is the greatest script in the history of Hollywood? If so watch this film!"
2,"Worthless, Except for Tarantino's Cameo","""Sleep with Me"" would be completely worthless if not for a Quentin Tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homoerotic undertones of ""Top Gun."" That lasts about two minutes. The remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious, ersatz neo-Bohemian characters. Except for Tarantino's ""Top Gun"" bit (and the twenty seconds or so when Parker Posey has her shirt off) there's nothing worthwhile here."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"This was a 70s ??? movie of very poor quality and lighting that stopped playing multiple times and had several partially skipped scenes. Again, return postage and ""restocking fees would add up to more than the cost of the CD."
1,Mammy how I love ya how I love ya,"Nothing like a jewish guy in blackface, i always say, buy this cd, get yourself some black shoe polish and blackeface youself up, get some friends over get drunk and do Jolson imiations, ehat great entertainment!"
5,Beautiful Voice and Okinawa Music!,"The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it. Rimi has a very high and beautiful voice -it was said it's the best voice in Japan in 40 years.Her music root is from Okinawa - it's very different than the average J-pop. It's more folk, traditional instrument,I especially enjoy track 7, track 8 in the CD. It's very peace, calm, tranquil.... the last track Nada Soso is a live recording..."
5,"""A Lady Must Live"" with a sense of humor and sauciness","Here is a recording that is state-of-the-art, with engaging songs, first-rate accompaniment, a performer with a keen sense of jazz who can find the humor within, and a voice that can be disarmingly sexy and yet slightly ironic.Sherman is a terrific pianist, performing in a mainstream jazz mode that is complex in its harmonies but easy on the ear. Although a jazz musician, Sherman is also attentive to the words. Listen to ""Fun To Be Fooled,"" a complex melody and a lyric demanding maturity to communicate its irony to the listener,With the confidence to be playful and sexy, Daryl Sherman's own musicianship is abetted by some of the best talent to be found, none more so than producer, Jay Leonhart."
3,rural work in Brazil,"in my coutry, the rural work is many important for the national economy, but in the book, my big coutry (and big rural space) isn't mencioned, more than 60% of the Brazilians is rural economy dependent, the urbanization crossing the 50%, the cities of the my coutry be stagned, the work market, the workers dont has especialized trainament, they are indegents in the more 300 importants cities witch many 200.000 hab.the cities is no support the intern rural imigrants, the globalization dont welcome that, you can up the investiments in medium cities, the contrasts is many big, the MST (movimento sem terra)(workers of no land), deteriorat the rural sistem, the Brazil is many different of Argentina, one zoom in the latinamerica economy you are look other world. i dont speak inglish right but i'try i'm sorry. (i buy the newsweek to study inglish but dont results)"
2,Not for multiple page use,I thought that it worked fine for single-sheet cuts but failed to cut more than 2 or 3 pages accurately. I do mini-comics made up of as manny as 12 sheets. I ruined one book by attempting to trim it.
4,lbc,"one of the albums that started the domination of hip hop by west coast rappers in the early 90's.a more than good album by warren g.nice beats and good rapping by warren g and guest star nate dogg.most recognizable songs are ""do you see"",""this dj"", and ""regulate"", one of the best rap songs ever.a classic hip hop album from the west coast and much better than what people think."
4,The classic g-funk material,"Warren-g's debut album 'Regulate g-funk era' was one of the best rap/Crip hop albums of 1994. Although not much of the media recognized warren as a great artist, hit singles like ""Regulate"" ""Do you See"" and ""This DJ"" put Warren in the house. I remember when ""Regulate"" first came out off the 'Above the rim' sdtk thats when Warren-g was really starting to get known. Any body who likes gangsta rap would like this, so get it."
5,unbeatable,"G-funk will set the mood for anything. It relaxes and gives you a natta care in the world feel. the beats are chill which is what this album represents, and the flows bring you to the streets without throwing a gat in your face. The Regulate...G Funk Era brought a happy medium that says thug life under it's breath with metaphores. Unfortunately g-dub wasn't able to duplicate the success he had with this, his first album. If you ask me, thats because this work was unbeatable."
4,Always a classic.,"It's phat to throw on these classics sometimes. If you're reading this and you don't know what ""classics"" I'm talking about, you probably never watched TV back in '94. ""Regulate"" & ""This D.J."" were always on MTV and those were the good ol' days. 6 years later and this is still a good CD. The skits are a little annoying and Warren G fans can't help but be a little disappointed in the direction he has taken since this album. Don't look down on him for today's pop-rap because everybody does their own thing. Focusing on this record though, there are other tight tracks other than the obvious and this CD makes for good listening."
3,Not great,"Regulate is one of the best G-funk songs ever. But that is largely down to Nate Dogg. Warren G is not an especially good rapper. This album is a nice album to put on once in a while, but Warren G doesn't compare to the likes of Dre and Daz Dillinger as a rapper/producer. I am not tempted to get any other Warren G albums."
1,no good,the edited version is no good. if you want to buy this cd then just buy the unedited 'regulate G funk era'. you will enjoy it much more than the edited copy.
2,Yeah this does need Regulating,"This album was such a disappointment considering the opening track, Regulate, which is a classic hip-hop tune. You cant wait to hear the rest of the album, but in terms or creativeness and quality of MUSIC on the album there is very little- Im sorry but a good album cannot be such just by some boys talking sh** rhythmically. Yeah there's a bit of a G-Funk groove on some tracks and is alright as a bit of party music, artistically its nothing and if you want some G-funk party tunes get some early Snoop"
1,What's the big deal???!!!,I didn't particularly like this album. With the exception of like 2 songs everything else is wack and forgettable!!! I haven't listened to this cd in months after the first time!!!!
5,"Regulators, the best rap album ever produced!","This is the best and greatest rap album ever made. I recommend this album to all rap enthusiats, even though this album is from 1994."
3,A classic album..... but a waste of money if you have it already,"This special edition of Warren G's classic album ""Regulate...G Funk Era"" is a waste of money to me because the second disc just features the remixes from the albums singles. The remix toRegulatewere on the CD Maxi and vinyl single and is also on Sevral Death Row compilation albums and the Japan release. Plus, the remixes to ""Do You See"" and ""This DJ"" are radio/video lyrics. India.Arie's classic debutAcoustic Soulhas the same kind of re-issue with the vinyl/cd maxi single remixes. And while the remixes aren't bad, minus the edited lyrics, they are not worth the re-purchase."
5,G-Funk,"This is Warren's Best album by far, the sound of this music just flows together so well with the rappers styles, they just melt into one another. This is definately a classic album, and although it's been around for about 6 years or so, it still seems like it hasn't aged a day.A song like ""Regulate"" is just classic and there's nothing else to it, but past that there are just some smooth songs like ""This DJ"" which was also played heavily on MTV. ""Do You See"", ""Recognize"",""Super Soul Sis"" ""So Many Ways"", ""This Is The Shack"" (even if this song Warren doesnt even rap in, it prompted me to buy the Dove Shacks album) ""What's Next"" (listen for his misspelling of Next it's funny) N-X-E-T. ""And Ya Don't Stop"" and ""Runnin' Wit No Breaks"" hold up, that would be all of them now wouldnt it, now there is no question to pick this one up. So Get It. It's a must."
3,Chinese Phrases for Dummies,"Chinese Phrases for Dummies is a must have for any traveler going to China. I'm currently here in China for one year as a Spoken English teacher at both a kindergarten and a middle school. Although I'm having difficulties with the tones in the Chinese language, the very fact that I'm trying gets a positive reaction from sales people here, especially those who come into the cities to sell their wares in the open markets. They are very obliging to the ""dumb"" American and graciously correct my pronunciation for me. This book is easy to read and you don't need to read the whole thing if you don't want to. You can concentrate on just the sections you need. I definately reccommend this book."
4,Helpful!!,This book is helpful but the words are only written in pinyin! If you want to learn the characters then I suggest you get another book. If you want to learn how to say words then this book may be helpful to you.
4,Good basics for beginner,"As someone going to China for a couple of weeks, I was looking for a book that would allow me to function without requiring in depth learning of the language. By showing both the mandarin and pinyin, allows easy pronunciation of the words and tones."
4,still bumpin,"i found this jam i had made on a mix tape i made on isley brothers music and Whitney Houston tore this up. her and Mr.biggs in the video bring back good memorys and times. Whitney Houston is one the Greatest Artists Ever,she truly has left a lasting mark on music and this jam, still is cool.gotta get my Mr.Biggs Pimp cane and step to this."
2,Fans here are overreacting...,"Fine, Whitney is a legend... But 'Just Whitney' is nothing more than OK. The lyrics and melodies are ok, but what most matters_THE VOICE_ is not quite there. I think fans must get a sense of reality and admit this album is not a big deal. I must say though I like it and the songs are very easy listenning. I like 'One of those days','My love','Unshamed'. But fans, I know you love Whitney as much as I do, but please stop saying this album is great and that Whitney couldn't do it better. She sure can do better than that and I'm sure she will."
5,"great music, can hook chris up with a great oppurtunity","while I was visiting the virgin isalnds with my friend and her family, we met great people on norman isalnd at a place called billy bones. Her name was Kirstie and we asked her about the band and we had found out it was her boyfriend. we immediatly asked how we could purchase his cd. It was a great sound and i loved it. If you would like my help to get starteds chris, I have connections with the president of one of the larger fraternities at unc- chapel hill. that is how dave matthews got started and i know that your cd will be a huge hit among the frats in north carolina."
5,Just an Awesome Mellow Instamental LP,This LP is great the piano and organ are right up there if not better then Ronnie earl on guitar. I love how they seem to leave lots of space in there music not playing on top of eachotherThis is a Great Blues / Jazz Album.
5,Extension Tubes,A well-made set that has the contacts necessary for use in the digital SLR's from nikon. It is very helpful in macro-photography. A fine purchase.
2,Terrible feel to mechanics,"I didn't try the tubes (I'm sure they worked fine), but they ground together so terribly when I opened the box that I didn't want to get them close to my camera. I found them very hard to move and I didn't like the release latches, either--had to push too hard to get them apart. The Kenko tubes are part plastic, but work perfectly (and smoothly!) with a nice fast 50mm, making for great macro photos--I recommend them instead."
3,A good place to start,"This book tries to do so much in so little pages. As the book says it is the basics of Christian education, but sometimes an overview is so broad, that you cannot see that much.While the chapters are generally good, one has to use her Bibliography in order to actually understand what happens in Christian Education. This book would be good for volunteers who want more a general idea of why Christian Education is important."
3,"Pleasant, leisure reading","This is an excellent night-stand book. A collection of short stories,typical Damon Runyan. Most of its short stories can be read in twenty minutes or less. Some I found uninteresting, others delightful. My favorites are the ""Lemon Drop Kid"" and the baby sitting bank robber. A fun book for teen-agers also.W. Dannenmaier"
4,Good for the price!,"When I saw how much Amazon was selling this package for, I had to jump on it. As the previous reviewer pointed out, the car kit alone (tape adapter and cigarette lighter plug) would usually set you back more than this package. So, keeping in mind that the CD player is basically free, it's not bad-sounding at all. A little shallow-sounding, yes, but not bad for a mass produced good from China. As for the skips the other reviewer mentioned, there is a few seconds' lag time between the start of a song and loading the 15 second buffer (whose progress you get to see on the display). If you're unlucky enough to hit a bump during these few seconds, yes, you will get a skip. But for the remainder of the song you'll be in skip-free cost-free bliss."
1,Do not buy.,"Ordered one of these units. Worked ok for a very short period of time. Sent back for a replacement, 2nd unit not working right out of the box."
4,"Good Live Disk, but .....","Vikki's Live is always enjoyable. But I like ""Live at the Greek Theatre"" much more than this CD.Because ""Live at the Greek Theatre"" is heartily and fresh mood.I could get this CD at last, so I'm happy to listen her Live and Recording sound is excellent."
2,Not for Latinos,"As much as I like Vikki I can't give this album a good rating. Vikki is capable of so much better! Not a single guitar or bass viol. The orchestra is all brass, strings,piano and drums. Also "" Te quiero dijiste"" in my memory is ""Munequita Linda"" and is performed without even mentioning the ""doll"""
5,A smashing souvenir from her PBS special,"I've got an advance copy of this CD, and it's terrific. It's the soundtrack to Vikki's PBS special, and features the Mexican-American diva performing some of the classic bilingual love songs from the '40s and '50s. I could have done without Jack Jones, but her duet with Pepe Aguilar on ""Acercate Mas"" is simply magical. And ""Tres Palabras,"" which features Arturo Sandoval playing trumpet, is one of the most sensual things Vikki has ever done. This is a great disc, a great addition to her repertoire of classic songs. People who have been waiting for Vikki to record in English again should not pass this disc up -- it's simply incredible!"
4,Good scrapbooking tips!,I really enjoy this series. Not only do I enjoy mysteries but I'm a scrapbooker as well. Keep them coming!
4,mystery and scrapbooking,I really enjoy Laura Child's writing style. Enough detail to paint the scene but no overkill. A quick read and enjoyable. I prefer her tea novels to the scrapbooking novels mainly due to the characters (don't like the hubby/exhubby). But I still enjoy the scrap novels. I like the setting of the novels.
3,Too Much Monkey Business,"I didn't really learn anything new about the Yardbirds after reading this. Considering they were one of the most exciting and important bands in rock history, I would have expected more 'meat'. I felt Alan Clayson's writing style got in the way at times, distracting somewhat. However, the photos are really outstanding, particularly the cover shot showing them at Studio 51 in London (I think). What a classic moment frozen in time. Glad I read it. Any Yardbird book is better than no Yardbird book, however, there are better ones."
3,"Not bad, not great","There are lots of pictures of the band throughout however, the author seems rather full of himself and is frequently loquacious (irony intended) simply for the sake of trying to come off as an intellectual, rather than adding anything to the story. All in all, if you can deal with the author's arrogance long enough to get through the book, it's not bad."
3,It's an OK Soundtrack ...,"but considering the fact that composer John Murphy had some pretty big shoes to fill when he worked on this particular film score, he didn't do too badly.Incorporating thematic elements from the original Basic Instinct score, composed by the late, great Jerry Goldsmith, gave the score an overall sense of continuity from the original film, but there wasn't the sense of seductive mystery and menace which made the original Basic Instinct score such a classic.In any case, the Basic Instinct 2 soundtrack isn't bad, but I still can't help feeling that there should have been more mystery within the music."
2,luke-warm service,"A somewhat jarring patchwork of a soundtrack, copy-pasting its most striking compositions straight from Jerry Goldsmith's highly original 1992 score (available on Prometheus Records). If some cues are flat one-to-one re-orchestrations, others sport pre-shrunk tempi to fit Michael Caton-Jones' tone-deaf directing."
3,Some Fun,"Smokey Wilson delivers a sometimes fun album. The joy he show playing on this album is a delight, however it does not reach the heights of 'The Man from Mars'. The highlights are 'House in Hollywood', 'Rat takin' your cheese' and 'Can't make it without you' which highlight his singing and guitar playing."
2,Do you like surf music...,"Do you like surf music, the ventures and Theremin types of sounds, then this group is just what your looking for. Not interested in vocals, then this group is for you! Well recorded and produced. Lots of it reminds me of the sound tracks for the ""Bug"" and ""Space Ship"" movies of the 50's, If Ed Wood had access to this band I'm certain they could have done the sound track for ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""."
4,"Great fun for 2.5 yo, would make good gift","Big hit at bedtime for my 2.5 yo DS. Laughed at the dog riding the goat. Silly text (...) and bright illustrations w/ good contrast. Got this book from the library, may buy it, will add it to our list of potential gift books for DS's little friends' b'days.(...)It's sweet and exuberant at the same time."
5,Great illustrations,Everyone loves this nursery rhymne but the illstrations are remarkable. My kids love this book and I really enjoy looking at the book.
1,Disappointed,"Uncomfortable, low grade materials, slides around. Pokes you in the back, flimsy. Does not work well with heavier guitars. Appearance and feel indicate a cheapo product."
4,Not just piano and orchestra,"I was a bit disappointed when I got this CD and saw that there were some vocals on it. Mel Torme fine, but Kathy Lee Gifford???? I re-burned it without most of the vocals and it is a fine CD."
3,¡Hola amigos!,"The book has been delivered in good state. The book is particularly useful for including the guidelines for the video, which so far has been impossible to order from here!It is a pity that this series of textbooks, like all publications by Houghton Mifflin in general, are so hard to find in Europe, since they are extremely well structured and ideal especially for the curriculum of international schools, or schools offering the IB programme."
4,Great series,The Boleyn Inheritance was an excellent read. This book was one of my favorites in the series. It is written in a narrative-type format by 3 different women. This format kept me very interested. It made the differences and similarities between the 3 women really stand out because you could view events from 3 different sets of eyes.
5,THE BOLEYN INHERITANCE,"Arlette Gaffrey/Author and avid reader, San Diego, but born in New OrleansI loved the OTHER BOLEYN GIRL, and I have enjoyed this one every bit as much, I've read most of Philippa Gregory's books and find each one just as good as the last. She has done a wonderful job of painting the time and place so that you can see it all very clearly. I also love the way she tells the story. I couldn't put it down once I started writing it."
5,Another fantastic Philippa Gregory book!,"I got hooked by reading ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", then enjoyed ""The Boleyn Inheritance"" as much if not more if that's possible. If you want to get into this whole great series, it starts with ""The Constant Princess"" but the ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", ""The Boleyn Inheritance"", and ""The Queen's Fool"" are the most compelling.If you want to know about the time that was somewhat skipped before ""The Queen's Fool"" you can read ""- The Last Wife of Henry VIII by Carolly Erickson"" (my rating - 3 stars) and ""Innocent Traitor: A Novel of Lady Jane Grey"" by Alison Weir (my rating 4 stars) before ""The Queen's Fool"" (my rating 5 stars). I would then skip ""The Virgin's Lover"" only because I consider it a 3 star and perhaps replace it with ""The Life of Elizabeth I by Alison Weir (4.5 stars by Amazon reviewers)"
4,A great follow-up to The Other Boleyn Girl,"Three women take turns telling the fascinating story of the Boleyn inheritance: Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard and Jane Rochford. Each character is interesting and unique in her own way. Overall, it's a great read but I thought that it dragged on a bit about two-thirds into the book, with the story wrapping up quickly at the end. Having said that, I did enjoy this book and recommend it if you like to read about the Tudor period."
4,"Interesting, Very Readable, Fictional Account of Tudor England","""The Boleyn Inheritance,"" by Philippa Gregory, was a very entertaining read. I am fascinated by Tudor England and read evreyting I can on the subject - fiction and non-fiction. Gregory writes a nice story about three women in Henry VIII's life: Jane Boleyn, Anne of Cleves, and Jane Rochford. I recommend this book to anyone wanting another view of Henry VIII's reign."
5,Another successful book of Mrs. Gregory,"I love this book as much as 'The Other Boleyn Girl' though it is a little bit different - the story is told by three woment in turn, chapter after chapter the events are described from three different angles. At first it sounded unusual but then I fully got used to it and enjoy the book immensely (just in the middle of the book now). My recommendations to all who like history and Henry VIII times."
3,Fell Short,"This book was not as good as The Other Boleyn Girl. It seemed to drag at the end, going back and forth between the three women: Anne of Cleves, Jane Boleyn and Katherine Howard. Although I loved finding out what happened to King Henry's next wives, the novel itself fell short for me."
5,Another great book by Phillipa Gregory,"I read this book shortly after finishing The Other Boleyn Girl. This book was an amazing story of the wives of King Henry VIII after the execution of Anne Boleyn and death of Jane Seymour. This story seemed to take place in a more somber, yet more dangerous, time after their deaths. Madness continued to consume the King, and England lived in fear of him. Despite this, greedy families still sent their young women to seduce him in order to further their ambitions. Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard are two of Henry VIII's lesser-known wives, and Phillipa Gregory did an amazing job of creating 3 dimensional characters out of these women. I really liked this book!"
4,...No Fury Like a Woman Beheaded,"KF Zuzulo is the author of A Genie in the House of Saud: Zubis RisesIt's almost as dead Anne Boleyn curses Henry to perceive his marital lot as intolerable, no matter who he was married to. He really was a churlish cur; and, in this version of the tale, he's not even attractive anymore. However, if you liked The Other Boleyn Girl, you'll really enjoy this extension on the story of courtly intrigue and the scheming necessary for survival. You can't blame the chaste Anne of Cleaves for being a pushover, or Jane Boleyn for being a twit, or Katherine for being a silly simp. They were just being the women they were -- the intrigue lies in how that interacts with Henry's reprehensible personality.Gregory conveys all the glamour and pageantry of courtly life in a way that makes you feel you've studied the era -- plus you get all the juicy gossip and scandal. Not as sexy as The Other Boleyn Girl, but definitely worth reading."
4,"Slow start, but good ending.","I found all three main characters to be absurdly naive at the beginning, which was annoying and distracting. However, as events unfolded, the characters became much more realistic and, consequently, I was able to get into the book a lot more. It turned out to be a great read!"
4,Historical Fiction,Nicely written follow-up to The Other Boleyn Girl. Interesting insight into the lives of relatively unknown women. The narrative style of all three women's stories added another dimension to their personalities. Very enjoyable and left me wanting more.
5,A fantastic read,"I was intrigued into the story of Kathryn Howard and Jane Rochford after watching the Tudors. I knew that the series wasn't completely historically accurate, and this book was a great attempt to reach historical accuracy. They way it was laid out and narrated was done beautifully and made it reader friendly and enjoyable. The 3 different women who speak from this book have their voices heard in and their stories told in the most unique way. I found this book to hold me the best of all the novels I've read thus far regarding the Tudors reign and King Henry's wives. If you do not wish to read a 500+ page book, I found the book-on-tape/disc to be equally if not more enjoyable to hear because the book is truly brought to life through the women speaking. Highly recommended for a leisurely read."
5,Amazing!!!!,"This is a great book it has everything from love to betrayal, the book is set in (1539 to 1547) It starts off with a little bit of where one of King Henry's past lady's in waiting for many of his past queens life has taken her from being in one of the richest courts to being a poor spinster, it then leads on to the fight between many young girls for the crown for queen of England with Anne of Cleaves finally wining. Anne's household then sets off to the court of England many events take place and the King finds he dislikes his new bride but one of his queen's maids have caught his eye it then goes on a thrilling journey that in the end leads to the scaffold. If you like these kind of stories or if you have never read anything like this before i definitely say you should get this it is a great read it kept me up all night I was so tried for school. :)"
5,Loved it!,"I loved the way this book was told from 3 points of view. I found it entirely engrossing and couldn't put it down. You really don't get to read much about Anne of Cleves, so it was interesting to read what she might have been like. There isn't much known about her, but she certainly can be considered the luckiest of Henry VIII's wives! I always thought from her Holbein portrait that she was pretty, so I've always wondered why Henry was so repulsed by her. This book gives a convincing reason that could very well have been the truth. If you liked the other books by Gregory, you will enjoy this one also. In fact, it's my favorite of the 3."
3,Repetitive and melodramatic,"This is the first P. Gregory book I've read and was disappointed. It seems, at times, as though it should be on the juvenile shelf.I give it a 3 because I do like the fact that it's told from the viewpoint of three completely different women, and I really like that it gives one a glimpse into what it could have been like for Anne of Cleves. I know so little about the 4th wive, and I was delighted to have that perspective.However, once the king marries Katherine Howard, the story goes downhill and becomes incredibly repetitive and filled with the exhaustive, melodramatic lamentations of these three women.This book would have been fine had it been shortened to about half its length.All in all, not a bad book ~ just over long. I would still recommend it to certain people."
5,Wonderful dramatization of 3 important Tudor women,"This book sneaks up on you...it starts out seeming like light historical fiction, but gradually turns into a compelling and emotional biography of three very important figures in the Henrician saga, who have been sadly overshadowed by their more notorious contemporaries (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Princesses Mary & Elizabeth...).Author Gregory captures the alternating sensuality and madness of the Tudor court, cleverly juxtaposing three first-person narratives taht serve to expertly depict their stories. Page turning entertainment, especially for genre fans."
3,Boleyn Inheritance,"As a sequal, the Boleyn Inheritance did fulfill my desire for the story not to end. But it did not top the first book. I felt too much had been skipped over, for instance Henry's marriage to Jane Seymour is glossed over completely. Katherine Howard was not nearly as likeably as Mary Boleyn, nor as savy as Anne Boleyn. I felt the book ended too soon, and should have ended with Henrys death, not Katherines. I do think Gregory has a talent for bringing historical characters to life, to make us think about how their lives must have been in context to the times. I think she is nearly as good as Josephine Tey, and I will look for more books by this author."
5,Excellent,"It was slightly confusing at the beginning of this book, since it shifts between the viewpoints of three women, but once I began to differentiate between the personality traits and roles of these three and could keep that straight, I was hooked! This book was so good that I had it open in my lap to read as I stopped at stoplights while out Christmas shopping and picked up a copy to read where I had left off while I waited in line at our local Borders. If that's not ""couldn't put it down,"" I don't know what is."
4,A great continuation of Gregory's Tudor series.,"This book is an interesting contrast and continuation of the story Phillipa Gregory started in The Other Boleyn Girl and The Constant Princess. It tells part of that story from a different viewpoint while also showing how Henry VIII changed as he aged. I was fascinated by her portrayals of Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard, two of Henry VIII's wives about which little is known. Also, Gregory paints a very humanizing portrait of Jane Boleyn, the woman who sent Anne and George to their deaths. I am a big fan of Gregory's work, and while this book isn't as much of a page turner as The Other Boleyn Girl and The Virgin's Lover, it fills a void in the continuum of her stories."
4,Very Interesting,I never really thought much of Lady Rochford but I found this book to be a great read for the unknown ladies affected by Henry VIII after Anne Boleyn. Also found Anne of Cleves to be very interesting.
3,Appropriate for Adult reading only,"This is a well written account of the Tudor court. However, after reading a good portion of it, I realized it is certainly not appropriate for my 14 year old to read. Lots of detailed sensuality...read before your children do...."
2,Let down,"I read the preview for this book, couln't wait to read a really sink my teeth british tudor novel. I was very much let down. It wasn't a mystery at all and that is what I was looking for."
5,"As good as ""The Other Boelyn Girl""!","During my vacation I have read both ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Boelyn Inheritance"". The former, while good, tended to drag a bit in my opinion. On the other hand, I could not put ""The Boelyn Inheritance"" down! Gregory does a great job of making you feel invested in these people. Although as history teacher I knew what Katherine Howard's fate was, I still found myself in tears when she met her death. You really felt sorry for this girl whose only fault was wanting to be able to act her age and love the man of her choice. On the other hand, it was great to see Anne of Cleves create a new life for herself away from her brother and King Henry. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of good historical fiction!"
2,A Servere Letdown,"This book moved sooooo slowly. it was nothing at all like the other boleyn girl. In this book, jane boleyn was a innocent, remorseful widow, Anne of cleves was confused all the time and katherine was an idiot.Im not finished with it yet but so far this sucks!"
4,Very good book,"Wow. This book is a very good sequel. I couldnt wait to find out what happens to Anne, Kitty, and Jane. There was lots of deceiving, and scheming in this book. I got my moneys worth and I recommend this book for reading. You will enjoy it!"
3,The Boleyn Inheritance,"Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite authors... however, I did not feel this was up to her usual standards... far too repetitive.At first, the use of three main characters to move the story along, seemed to work, then they seemed to be repeating, repeating, repeating... but it did throw some insights into what might have been Anne of Cleves traits and character..."
1,VERY inaccurate!,"I LOVE history and historical novels, but it really bothers me when an author takes real historical people & events, and completely changes the story! If you want to write absolute fiction, then do that! Don't use real people, places, & events and misrepresent ""history"" to people who think they are getting ""historical"" information in the novel! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS AUTHOR TO ANYONE!!"
1,wriiten for a simpleton,"This book could easily be edited down to 1/4 of it's length. It is extraordinarily boring, slow moving and deeply repetitive. I do not have amnesia nor am i a simpleton. I do not need to be reminded of mundane details every 3 or 4 pages. I kept reading this book only to see if anything was every actually going to happen. I was sorely disappointed."
3,Mediocre,"In this book the story continues w/Henry VII after beheading Anne Boleyn and the death of his third wife, Jane Seymounr. Narrated per chapter by Jane Boleyn (Anne B.'s sister in law) Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. I enjoyed Anne of Cleves point of view the best but this is not a favorite of Gregory's books, I was disappointed. It certainly presents Henry VII as the insane, terrifying murderer that he was. Pick it up at the library and read it-- is my suggestion- before purchasing it."
2,Not nearly as good as The Other Boleyn Girl,"I loved The Other Boleyn Girl, but in my opinion The Boleyn Inherityance is not nearly as good. The story is told by 3 people--Katherine Howard, Ann of Cleves and Jane Boleyn (George's wife). These 3 are not nearly as interesting as Mary, Anne and George Boleyn were in The Other Boleyn Girl. Also, Henry the VIII in The Boleyn Inheritance is grossly obese, has a smelly leg wound and is using his power to behead and persecute lots of people, so there is no real love story as there was with Katherine of Aragon; Ann of Cleves and Katherine Howard both find him repulsive."
4,Really good book!,"I really enjoyed this book. I read the first one ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" for a book club and I just had to see what happened next.(In the story I mean. I knew as far as in history) I think this would be an great book if you enjoy drama and twist on history."
2,Odd chapter structure,"I like the use of descriptions to describe the dress and atmosphere. I was not prepared for the way it is organized. It switches from the viewpoint of three different characters. So it tells of an event through one character and then switches and tells the exact event again through the other two characters. So you are basically reading the same events three times. It is nice to see the different viewpoints, but after a while it gets predictable. I became bored with the same event being told three times."
2,My least favorite Gregory Novel,"While I wanted to love this book, the constant switching of perspectives sadly left me mainy confused. The highlight is reading from Katherine Howard's point-of-view but that is not enough of a plus to make me want to read it again."
4,historical fiction/novel,Philippa Gregory makes it easy to read history.Very good novel.A pleasent reading.
3,"It was no ""Other Bolyen Girl""","The book was a compelling historical read, but the characters did not grasp me like the Mary and Anne Bolyen from the previous novel. I feel that the jumpiness that came from the switching of point of view made it hard for me to relate to anyone character. I realize that Gregory is just playing with history, but the events depicted seemed disjointed with the factual events she included, especially in the end of the novel. I feel that this book was just okay when compared to other books of hers that I have read."
4,"Divorced, beheaded, died...","divorced, beheaded, survived. For me, at least, this book combined as a little history lesson about two queens one does not often read about in this genre and some great fiction. I was impressed by Ms. Gregory's development of her characters and the way she allowed the reader to see the Tudor court from three distinct perspectives. I found this book to be superior to The Virgin's Lover, and somehow more tragic than the Other Boleyn Girl. Perhaps it was the youth of Katherine Howard or the seemingly inescapable tyranny of the Henry that is portrayed in this novel, but I found this one particularly sad and intense all at the same time. Overall, an engaging read for any Philippa Gregory fan or a fan of historical fiction."
3,I'll give it three stars,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl, I was excited for this book, especially because it was told from the first-person of three different characters.I'm not completely disappointed, but this novel was not the work I had expected from Philippa Gregory. Mrs. Gregory knows how to create well-rounded characters that breathe, we all know that, but this novel just didn't do it for me. It was too long for its content (yeah, I get that some 400-page books are great, but that doesn't mean we should all strive to write 400 pages with the content to fill 250).In The Other Boleyn Girl, the characters are dramatic and--well, people. In this book, they were all just complaining about how stupid and mean Henry VIII was, which, albeit probably true, is not what I want to read in a book. Henry VIII was probably an awful man to deal with, but that shouldn't hinder character development and personality. Unfortunately, in this book, it did.However, while it had its"
4,Fascinating look at three lesser known females in Henry VIII's court,"I believe this is my fifth Philippa Gregory book and, while (to me) it is not nearly as good as The Other Boleyn Girl, it's an entertaining read nonetheless. The Boleyn Inheritance is told from the alternating first person perspectives of Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard and Jane Boleyn, each short chapter jumping between these three lesser known females who inhabited Henry VIII's court. I enjoyed Gregory's exploration of sweet and simple Anne of Cleves (Henry's fourth wife), dimwitted and self -absorbed Katherine Howard (Henry's fifth wife) and scheming yet tormented Jane Boleyn (lady in waiting to Anne and Katherine as well as sister-in-law to Anne Boleyn). Anyone who enjoys historical fictional, particularly involving Henry VIII and his wives, will likely enjoy this book ... but just do not expect to enjoy it as much as The Other Boleyn Girl."
3,Close but not perfect,The book is good in melding the Josh Thurlow storyline to important figures who also served in the Pacific theatre in WWII. The problem is that they are too unrealistically woven into the plot and story.Overall a good read but not a great book.
5,Ambassador's Son-cn,"Beware of picking up any of the Josh Thurlow series books. You won't be able to put them down once you start. The action forces you from one chapter to the next. The thourough historical background is also an outstanding feature at least for me. As I would get to the end of the book, I felt a little pang at my heart saying ""Oh no, it's almost over, what will I do then?"""
3,Graet opportunity missed,"What a wasted chance to produce a ""best of"" Govi. This album is simply a collection of upbeat tunes from this exceptional artist. For me the best of Govi is easily the slower numbers where his technique with the guitar is far better than the so called ""greats"" like Clapton el al. Only the great Peter Green at his Zenith in the late 60's and early 70's equals Govi at his best. No Strings Attached is fine for motoring, when your concentration is elsewhere.For the real best of Govi get Sky High, Passion & Grace and Guitar Odyssey."
2,"Great, if you can't tell time","The watch is really cute, love the design but it was dead when it arrived...we'll see what a new battery does."
4,"Great music, but a little disappointed","As always, Yoko Kanno delivers a strong album, but I'm disappointed that the version of ""When Heaven's Not Enough"", as sung in the first episode of the show, doesn't seem to be on any of the soundtracks. The second soundtrack has the Steve Conte version of the song, which I love, but not the female vocalist's version. Oh well. :P"
4,good music,I've been looking for some Celtic music since we went to the local Scottish-Irish festival last summer. This is pretty close to what we heard there.
4,Great Feeder,"I really like this feeder because it makes it easy to feed my stubborn frogs in the tank I have. It also makes it easy to direct the food towards certain fish in the tank. The only down side is that the hole is very small and the only thing I have been able to feed out of it is live brown worms. And I've been having difficulty doing that because it doesn't want to suck them up. I haven't had a chance to try live brine shrimp, those also might fit. All in all this is a great feeder and I would buy again."
4,Fish Feeder,Arrived in perfect condition. Just what I needed. Wish the barrel was a bit bigger for shrimp but very useful.
4,Good Book,"This is a good book if you are looking to prepare yourself for the SAT I, i really recomend it, because i helped me a lot to get a better score in my SAT I."
2,Good book...not great,"While this book does contain a little bit for everybody, it's not presented as well as in some other books. Some great explanations and examples, but most are at a very introductory level.The chapter on ASP.NET is well organized, and everyone interested in using ASP.NET will learn something. There is a great section on data validation and a clear explanation on how to use the Application, Session, and Cookie objects. ASP developers should have little trouble ramping up to ASP.NET quickly. Be aware that the coverage of ADO.NET is sketchy at best.All in all, Programming Visual Basic .NET is a good book. Not the best book you'll ever read on the subject, but a good beginning level book. If you've every had any experience with Visual Basic or ASP, most of the examples will be very easy to pick up on. However, you'll want to pick up at least one additional book to cover some of the gaps left by this book."
3,"OK book, but there are better books","This is an OK book but there are better books. The treatement of the essential language issues isn't very good: for example, Cornell's book is *much* much better at teaching the Visual Basic .NET language and in particular the Object Oriented Principles you need for VB NET. Troelsen's book (also from Apress) is much better for applications than this book. The book ""Coding Techniques for Microsoft VB NET"" by John Connell is also a book to consider over this one. In sum, while there is nothing very wrong with this book, there are just much better books.(Question to O'Reilly - why didn't you just port Liberty's book from C# to VB NET. It would have made a better book than this one and would have been one of the best books out there....)"
1,Good Luck with your order,"It says I purchased it on 10/14/06. That's correct ...but here it is 1/12/07 and I have not received the merchandise yet. I would not call this customer service at all. When I enquired about the product, since no one from Amazon contacted me at all, I was told it's on it's way in 4-6 weeks....HUH?"
5,Hasty speculation? Nonetheless an intriguing subject.,"Though I bought it on the chance that there could be a papal election sometime soon, it wound up not making much of a diffrence in terms of the enjoyment I got out of reading this book. It is fun to speculate, I admit, and you can't help but wonder how your own views will be represented in the next papacy. So, I approached this book with questions about the likely future at the Vatican. After reading I do feel that I have a better grasp on what the future may bring, but moreso I have a much better understanding of the nature of the politics, mechanics, other earthly matters that affect the Vatican. It is made-up of people, after all, and I came away with an appreciation for the way it works as an organization. Through the author's eyes the Vatican seems a lot less byzantine (if you'll pardon my choice of words) than I had previously thought. Anyway, I recomend this book for anyone interested in current affairs, Church history."
4,rockin' indeed,"so I read the other review, and mostly agree with what was said, I think comparisons to Mogwai and Godspeed You Black Emporer! are a bit of a stretch---this band resembles early Stereolab much more than either of the two previously mentioned bands--its a hard rocking interplay of rhythmic guitar groove, feedback-laced good times--a great background, rocking type of album--wear it jogging, listen to it in the car on a road-trip--you won't be humming catchy riffs per se, but you will tap your foot in time and love the energy--its got that feedback lounge type of feel that makes one think that the girls grew up listening to Stan Getz just as much as the Velvet Underground--Bridgette Bardot followed by Sonic Youth--Esquivel with equal parts Ramones--well...you get the idea"
5,The rise and fall of the Inca Empire...,"This is one of my favorite documentaries. My interest in Peru comes from my affection for the soothing traditional folk music I've heard. This movie presents the wide range of culture and ethnic diffusion that makes this area so interesting. The history of the rise and fall of the Inca Empire is also quite remarkable. However, I like most how this movie presents its subjects artistically with mysterious and beautiful shots of the people and scenery to a backdrop of traditional music."
1,Disappointing,"The first book in this trilogy was an engaging and thoughtful thriller, a what-if change in history. The 2nd and 3rd parts after Christ clone veer more towards preaching without the hook of a good novel. Too bad."
4,Complete Satisfaction,"Ahh what a wonderful trilogy. I was totally satisfied with the ending, and was amazed at how skillfully BeauSeigneur was able to lead me down one path, then totally change directions. I suppose if I knew my Bible better he would not have been able to do this, but since I dont I was lead through the trilogy and the ups and downs of the characters. I thought this was a great, fast and thought provoking read."
4,A solid ending to a great series,"BeauSeigneur accomplishes a difficult task--ending this sophisticated, urgency-packed end times trilogy. Those familiar with Christian end-times fiction know how the book has to end. The author exposes evil, applauds righteousness, and mourns the multitudes who are deluded by the most ancient of enemies.While the author does better than most, in this genre, I found the first two books moved at a better pace than number three. This conclusion had slow spots, and occasionally was more obvious in exposing the author's viewpoints, than the previous two had been.In the end, I loved this series and hated to see it end. My sense is that the author felt the same way. I hope BeauSeigneur is discovered by the big publishing houses. Who knows, maybe he will do a similar series on the Tower of Babel?"
1,A Let Down,"After reading the first 2 books in this series, I eagerly jumped into the third. What a disappointment. The character construction and development from the first 2 books was almost totally forgotten in the final installment. It was obvious where the author wanted to go, but it was forced and contrived.I have also read what is available in the Left Behind series, and the pacing and layout of the story in these books is far better."
1,Science Fiction or Judeo-Christian Mythology?,"The first two books of the series were very exciting Sci-Fi. After about the middle of the third book however, the whole thing turns out to be nothing more than Judeo-Christian Mythology. Very disappointing. An insult to human intelligence. If you can digest evangelical propaganda, read this book. What a waste of time..."
1,"Promised much, but didn't deliver","Having read the first two books in the series, I was looking forward to what fresh ideas the author might surprise us with. The idea of the God we know not being the ""real"" God was scary to me, albeit not unknown. The gospel of Thomas also alludes to this theory. Sadly the final novel was a rehash of old ideas from a fundalmentalist viewpoint. I wish I had known this before investing my time in the series. Nothing new or revealing here."
2,Then there came this one!!!,"The first two books were great and so was this one. That is up until the end. Worst possible ending. I was so dissapointed that I almost threw the book away, but I didn't think my trash can could hold that much garbage... ergh!"
3,if you liked the first two....,"Book three of the trilogy was about as good as the preceding books. I found it long on Biblical verse myself. If you enjoyed the first 2 you'll enjoy this. If you were losing interest after the 2nd book, you won't find the 3rd volume to be more enthralling. At one point I thought the author was putting a very unique spin on traditional religious thinking and I wanted to finish the series, but that turned out to not be the case,and I must admit I skimmed a few pages to get through it."
5,AWESOME,THIS ALBUM ROCKS. DANIEL ROSSEN IS A GENIUS. CHECK OUT GRIZZLY BEAR AND DANIEL ROSSEN'S SOLO PROJECTS. HE DOES SOME AWESOME COVER SONGS.
5,Scissors,Product is exactly what I wanted. It arrived very quickly and was packaged nicely. My math students next year will be grateful to have these scissors in their little bags of goodies.....
4,A well-deserved tribute,This is a wondeful collection of performers saluting one of music's most underrated talents. It's consistently impressive material - and not just the hits. This CD is a chance to discover some of Nelson's lesser known work - and some lesser known artists who deserve your attention.
1,If you love Rick Nelson? Why do this to him?,"Terrible Terrible Terrible!! All who participated is this ugly CD.This is not worth the cost of a blank CD... You all should be ashamed! If you love Rick Nelson and his songs, you'll will understandthis hack job!"
3,Gel mouse pad,"Actually it makes a better elbow pad, if they had 2 pads, 1 at each end , it would be better."
4,A very nice mousepad at a fair price.,"The good:- Soft, smooth fabric on top, nicely sticky rubber underneath.- Adequately firm gel wrist rest.The not-so-good:- The gel wrist rest could be just a hair taller. Probably just my big hands, though, so may not apply to you.- It's not a rigid base, so as it drapes over the seam in my workspace there's a little ridge. You probably have a flat desk, so this probably doesn't apply to you either.Overall, I'm well-pleased with this. Those of you with average-sized hands and with an ordinarily flat workspace will be very happy indeed."
5,Perfect,"Don't listen to people who say it's too hard or too soft. This gel pad is the best thing I could've done to my wrists. I use computers all the time and I have had no wrist problems. I'm a software engineer.However, a few months ago my right wrist began to hurt every now and then. I wanted no chance of carpel tunneling, so I bought this gel pad. Ever since that day - I haven't had ANY pain whatsoever in my wrist. I can't believe I've been using a computer all these years without one. And for this price?It's perfect."
3,"cheap material. works, but not on my wireless mouse","It does what it's supposed to to do, give some supports to my wrist. however, a very weird thing, it doesn't work with my Microsoft Wireless optical mouse. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014J05EM. as far as i remember, some reviews mentioned this, and I should have listen to them.It's made from cheap material, ans very stinky first few days. There are many air pop on the surface, and it makes me think it's gonna be broken soon.I still give it 3 stars because it's working now, but not meet exceed my expectations, compare to my old fellowes one."
1,If you like resting your wrists on rock hard surfaces...,This thing is awful. I got it because I was resting my wrist uncomfortably on the desk and causing some carpal-tunnel syndroms in my hand. Using this has actually be WORSE than the desk itself. This thing is hard as a rock and makes my hand go numb immediately. Awful product that I am not happy with.
1,smells terrible,"It remains to be seen if this will go away, but this thin has some terrible new mousepad smell. Something chemical like Scotchgard gone bad or cheap packaging tape. Plus the gel pad seems to have air in it.Otherwise unremarkable.update:Smells like toxic chemicals. So strongly it can be smelled outside the plastic shopping bag it was tied up in 24 hours ago. The smell stays your hand for an hour after brief contact. This is not good. I'm returning this."
1,Mouse pad too thick,"I like Belkin products, I purchased this (Belkin Gel Mouse Pad), Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 and Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 for work. I like the mouse pad, but the mouse would not even move unless it was off the pad. I ended up using my old mouse pad until I can find a mouse pad that my mouse will work on. I can't send it back, because the cost to return it back is about the same amount I paid for it. SMH. I wish I would have kept my $8.00+."
5,nice pad,Like it a lot and do not understand why there are some people complaining. Recommend it for anyone using computers at least few hours a day.
3,its okay,I gave it 3 stars mostly because i don't like the finish and the fact that the gel rest is sinking in the center. I don't think its real gel inside coz it doesn't really feels soft and bouncy rather its a hand rest which seems like it may have foam base inside. Overall okay but not the best find.
5,Great little mouse pad with comfortable wrist support,I'm a software developer so I use my computer a LOT. This mouse pad is great quality and has a nice wrist support built into it. An ergo keyboard and a wrist support on the mouse are prob the two best things you can do to held your wrists if you work on the computer as much as I do.
1,Doesn't work with my Microsoft Optic mouse,This mouse pad does not work with my optic wireless mouse. The material is not condusive and the arrow does not track at all with mouse movements - it is not even close.
3,Not for optical mice,"Worked great with my $2 ball mouse and it's comfortable.Upgraded to a Logitech VX Revolution (optical mouse) and it doesn't work on this mousepad.5 Stars for this if you plan on using a ball mouse, totally worthless if using an optical."
2,Smells very strong and I hated the smell,"Yes the title you read is correct... I ordered 2 of these for work and home and now I regret. I could not bear the smell of these pads. I am surprised at the number of positive reviews. I don't know if its my dislike towards this kind of smell. I hated the smell of these... I don't even know how to put the smell into words..However, the quality seemed ok, the gel pad is fine and not hard like mentioned in some of the bad reviews here. It would have been usable for me if it was not this bad at odour. I sealed the pad in a bag with moth balls hoping the smell would change in few days, I will try to use it after few days."
4,Great for the price,This was exactly what I was looking for! Have not had any problems with it. I am not sure of the durability as I haven't had it very long. Will be putting it to good use though and so far my wrist feels better after working on the computer all day!
4,Comfortable,"This is a very comfortable mousepad. I have wrist problems and this helps alleviate the pain a lot. My only complaint is that I wish it were a bit wider, especially at the base where for some reason they decided to make it narrower."
4,Very nice pad,Pros: Very comfortable wrist paddingCons: I wish the mouse pad area was a little bigger. I have two large monitors so I need a lot of mouse movements. Sometimes the area is not enough but not very critical.
1,Not for an optical mouse!!,I ordered this mouse pad and it is so black it will not work with an optical mouse! Buyers beware. Lasers in optical mice do not seem to reflect from the very dark black material this mouse pad is made of.
5,I have 2 Now,Helps wrist and forearm fatige. Been using one for over three years and there is nothing better in a mouse pad.
1,Terrible - Belkin changed materials,"I also loved these mouse pads, have used them for years. Like the reviewer above, I just bought a new one, my third, and found that Belkin has changed them. The quality is entirely different and cheap now. The ""gel pad"" doesn't give, and I don't believe it's even gel - it feels like cheap foam."
2,Warning does NOT work with optical mouse,"I wanted a gel mouse pad because the memory foam mouse pads don't support your wrist. However, this mouse pad does not work with my optical mouse (red laser light). Odd because I have two other Belkin gel mouse pads and they work fine. Who would make a mouse pad these days that doesn't work with an optical mouse?"
5,Best value for the price,"I was really going back and forth over a couple different mouse pads w/ wrist support. They were both around $15, and luckily, I read a review on one of those that refrenced this mouse pad so I decided to check it out. I think it is very comfortable to use, and my Husband likes it too, I might order him one for his work computer. It was worth the money, and cost half of what the other ones did, I'm pretty happy with my purchase."
1,Beware this new inferior version,"My old version of this mousepad got worn after 5 years, but I did not realize that Belkin now only produces this inferior one. It smells like chemicals, the wrist pad is rather hard, and I cannot roll it up for transport as easily (it creates folds in the material). I returned the product for a refund.The only other similar product I could find was the Ultra ULT40060 Mouse Pad. So far, I like it. Best price & reviews at TigerDirect:[...]"
3,Not what I had hope for.,"The items were not as I have imagined. Although they were new, they were slightly defected in workmanship. I bought them based on price and so based on that I got what I paid for."
3,Great for Carpal Tunnel - But Belkin Changed the Design,"I've bought several of these from Amazon, so I'm averaging out my reviews. The original mouse pad that I bought was terrific, I've been using it for years now. Incredibly comfortable, and it kept away any carpal tunnel issues that I previously had.Those that I bought in the last two years or so, though, feel completely different. The rest gel for your wrist is stiff and not at all relaxing, and the mouse glides a little too easily for me (makes it harder to control).I'd give the original one I bought a five, it's an amazing mouse pad. I'd give the new ones that I bought (same exact Belkin model from Amazon) two stars, or a generous three. I wish I knew why they changed the design."
3,Great Mousepad but can be defective,Just ordered my 3rd of these. The first one lasted several years. The second I bought under a year ago and for some months now the cloth that covers the gel pad has been coming off. Has now become very uncomfortable - hence order for replacement.
5,"Good quality, but bigger than needed.","The size of the pad is truly about twice the size it needs to be (and I have a big hand), but it seems to be a good quality product."
5,very comfortable,"works just as advertised, very comfortable, especially when using for long periods of time. Makes a huge difference when using a computer for a long period of time."
3,Not that great,"I use a Logitech V200 Cordless Mouse - Black ( 931380-0403 ) for my laptop, and let me say this mousepad has not met my expectations.First of all, out of the box, there was a slight bubble in the fabric, resulting in an elevated/loose area of the mouse pad. For such a price, I would expect such obvious product/quality defects to be absent.Secondly, after some use/wear (for a few months), the mousepad started to become unresponsive to my mouse. The pointer would start jumping or not respond to certain areas on the mousepad. Also, the mousepad started to become ""stickier"" and my mouse would not glide very smoothly. And I know this is not my mouse or the computer, because I have tested other surfaces and the mouse worked just fine.The only thing I can commend this mousepad for is that it's comfortable to use."
5,Best mousepad for me,"I bought my first Belkin Gel Mouse Pad with wrist support ten years ago when I was suffering tendinitis in my hand from mouse use. The elevated wrist position was a big help and my repetitive strain injury receded ovet the next few weeks. That mouse pad eventually became frayed, worn and ugly. I replaced it with another which recently died in a similar state after quite a few years of use. I just received this third one and I like it better than its predecessors -- the wrist pad is better contoured and the Belkin logo is more tasteful and discreet. I highly recommend this product."
3,mouse pad,"Not a bad item, however it would be nicer if there was more room to move the mouse around."
2,Not for me,"I have not previously used a mouse pad with a wrist rest but thought it might be more comfortable. It seemed that way at first, but after about a week the raised portion develoved a big dent in it that kind of form fitted the heal of my hand. Still seemed comfortable enough, but then the bottom of my hand became chaffed and it no longer was pleasent to use."
1,A mousepad that doesn't work? Ridiculous!,"Guess I should have read the reviews before buying two of these to replace my aged mousepads at home and at work. Neither mouse worked when the mousepad was under it. I think the material might be too reflective for optical mice, though my coworker's optical mouse had no problems. Mine aren't off-brand mice either: one is a Dell and the other is a Microsoft. At any rate, it's best not to risk it if you have an optical mouse, in my opinion."
5,Great product,"The material is very comfortable and I love that the mouse pad and wrist pad are one piece and not separate. Some people have mentioned that it smells, it does smell a little bit, but you're not really going to notice unless you stick your nose into it and honestly it's like a new car smell. I recommend this everyone."
3,Okay for mini mouse but not for full size mouse,"This Mouse Pad is made by Belkin, and hence there is no question about the quality. It works fine with my laser wireless mouse. The gel pad is neither too soft or too hard.However, I am not very happy with this mouse pad. The mouse pad is medium sized and almost 1/4 space is taken by gel pad. This would be okay for mini mouse (travel mouse) but for a full size mouse like mine, there is not much space left for maneuver.I guess if you have comfortable space on your desk for mouse and if you are keyboard junkie, you may not need this product.The only reason I bought it was because it was cheap and I thought it will help with occasional Photoshop use. I am not using it everyday due to reasons mentioned above.Take some time to learn shortcuts on Firefox/Windows and save that frequent trip to your mouse."
5,Finally found the right pad,This is the first gel pad I've tried and its been the best mouse/wrist pad I've had. I had several stiff rubbery pads with similiar wrist supports but the gel in this one works so much better than those did. I have to agree the gel is not very yielding or form fitting but I think I prefer it this way. It is not hard at all but neither is it like the gel in an ice pak at room temperature which is more akin to water.
4,"works good, my hand falls asleep a few times daily","this mouse pad is very comfortable. But if you put your wrist over the edge then your circulation might slow like mine and your hand will fall asleep a few times a day, usually starting a few minutes after you start using it."
2,Doesnt Last,"It was ok at first, but the surface gleen wore off quickly and the wrist rest collapsed down, offering not much support after a month or so"
2,"Palm rest ""deflated"" after 1 day of use","It's a mousepad... How difficult can it be right?The palm rest ""deflated"" after only 1 day of use. After 3 days it's almost as uncomfortable as the flat desk it's sitting on. Don't waste your money on this one.."
1,UPDATE! Belkin changed these!,"I loved these mouse pads, have used them for years. I just bought a new one, my fourth, and found that Belkin has changed them. The quality is entirely different and cheap now. The weight is much lighter (the top corners don't even lay flat), the gel pad feels like a brick, and worst of all the surface is so reflective that my optical mouse does not track properly on it. As mouse pads go, these are pricey (but used to be worth it) and so I am very disappointed to see Belkin cut quality like this and rip off a longtime (now ex-) customer. It feels like they switched to a two-dollar mouse pad that they still want to sell at the old price."
5,very comfortable,"I was starting to get wrist pains with my mouse hand (""oh no! Carpal tunnel!"") so I ordered this pad.It seems small at first glance (maybe 3 mice wide), but it's all you'll need. The rubber texture on the bottom side keeps the pad stabilized on your desk. The top side is a soft fabric, so even though the wrist area's ""gel"", it feels natural and you forget that your wrist is elevated after a few minutes.It's incredibly simple and works as advertised; I wish I'd coughed up the $5 for one of these a long time ago. Very good product."
1,Doesn't work with optical mouse,"This looked exactly like the mouse pad I was replacing, but the the laser optical on my mouse doesn't work well with it and it's been sitting on my office floor since the day I got it... too inexpensive to return."
2,OMG The Fumes!,"Yeah it's comfortable and it does what it's supposed to... but the fumes coming off this thing are headache-inducing. I cannot recommend this product, unless you open the package, leave the pad outside to air-out for a week, then start using it.Gross!"
2,Absolute garbage.,I've had my mouse pad for a few weeks now and the wrist pad has completely broken down inside.. I might as well throw a block of concrete on my desk and use that.. Would not recommend or buy this product again.
2,bad smell,i agree with the other reviews. the have a bad smell that hasnt went away and it has been about two weeks now. there isnt much filling to give very much support and the material is very itchy and annoying. i reccomend teh fellowes mouse and wrist pads. they have much more of teh gel filling and teh surface is smooth and cool. not itchy. and they dont have a smell! not even when you first open it. they seem like much better quality for ur money.
2,"Hard, very hard.","It's hard to know before buying a product like this one if it's going to be soft. I'm telling you it's not. It feels a little bit softer than a table but not enough to me spending most of my time working in front of a computer screen.""Gel"" doesnt mean memory foam. If you are aware of that you are good to go."
5,Awesome mousepad,Been buying these belkin mousepads for years and they're great! Very comfortable! Thanks for offering this great product at a great price!
3,Good as intended to work,In general the product is good. What I didn't like is that the cushion where you place your wrist is not soft enough. I found it a bit harder than others I have tried before.
5,Comfortable and works well with newer laser mouse,"First, I had an ""older model"" of this same product (several years old) and the newer type of mouse with the newer type of laser did not work well on it. When I got this newer model of the mouse pad I was instantly surprised at how much better the mouse worked on it.Second, I know too many people with carpal tunnel problems, so having this type of mouse pad is a big help in that regard. It's comfortable to use and is easy on the wrist.In fact, I liked the new mouse pad I bought for use at home so much that I quickly bought a second one to use at my office."
1,Changing my review - TERRIBLE wrist pain,"Changing my review. After using it for a while, I developed TERRIBLE wrist pain. I never had wrist pain before, and I work with computers. The problem seems to be from 2 reasons: A The wrist support is far too hard and B The material sucks the heat out of your wrist.You will develop terrible pain. I stopped using the mousepad, and in a few weeks I was fine again.--Original Review Below--Has Belkin changed these? Yes. The new one I got is slightly different from the one I had for like 5 years. Is it still comfortable? Yes it's great. My crappy $20 Microsoft optical mouse tracks on it just fine.Bought one for home and one for work."
2,Makes my wrist numb,I find the wrist pad hard and uncomfortable. My wrist and hand feel numb after just a few minutes of resting on the pad. I don't recommend this product.
3,it's better than nothing - but not the best,if you are using your mouse - i think you'll love having a mousepad with a rest but a more expensive one would probably be more comfthis one is OKwe got one from walmart that is a little more cushy
2,Not good quality and short life,"I have been using it for 4 months now and the wrist rest is totally depressed in the middle where my wrist rests most of the time. It was in good shape and comfortable when I bought it, but not very durable."
5,Excellent!,Very comfortable pad - the wrist rest is just the right size and has the perfect amount of hardness and fluidity. I highly recommend it!
4,Latest ergonomics,"The wrist rest has a little dip in it, which allows your wrist to be in the correct ergonomic position. It is certainly big enough."
5,Awesome!,Bought this along with the MS ergonomic keyboard to relieve repetitive motion strain. Works great. Soft and comfy wrist support.
4,Nice,"It's a lot better than a flat pad, however after using for a hour or more my wrist will start hurting. Overall its a good product."
2,Disappointed,"It smells bad, and it doesn't work with my Microsoft X10 optical mouse.So, I'm using it upside down.Otherwise, decent wrist support."
1,TOO BIG,"I WANTED SOMETHING TO REST MY WRIST, BUT THIS CAUSED ME PAIN IN MY SHOULDER AND NECK. WISH I HAD NOT BOUGHT IT."
4,Helpful,I just received this today and have been enjoying it. I am at my computer a lot and it feels nice under my wrist.
4,Good level of comfort but smaller than expected,"On the positive side, the pad is moderately comfortable. The wrist rest is soft and allows me to use it continuously for an hour or more without the strain or discomfort I felt with my traditional mouse pad. I got this mouse mainly to prevent carpal tunnel or other conditions causing nerve damage. So far it's been doing the intended job suitably.The only drawback is the lack of space since it's design is narrow. I would have preferred a slightly larger pad for gaming or web browsing. Others who are accustomed to larger pads may experience the same annoyance. I've grown used to it and instinctively know the boundaries now.I'm not sure how durable this product is as of now. I've owned this pad for about 2 months and used it on a daily basis. I haven't noticed any wear and tear or performance issues."
3,"Good for the wrist, but did not work with my optical mouse","My wrist pain is gone, but my mouse is unresponsive. I actually get better response off my wood desk than with this mouse pad. I solved the problem by cutting the mouse pad part off and just using the wrist pad with my old mouse pad. I don't recommend this pad with an optical mouse. I can not give an opinion with a ball or laser mouse. Good luck."
3,not good with my laser mouse,"This mousepad is really comfortable, a good size (not too small, not too big), but I found that the surface is so smooth (maybe made of neoprene?) that my laser mouse doesn't work very well with it. Although I can use my mouse with it, the pointer becomes a bit ""jumpy"" and it is hard to have pin-point accuracy. However, I suspect that if you have a rollerball mouse, that this would not be a problem (although I have not tested it with one)."
5,COMFY,Just what I needed.Just the right size.Not too large to take up too much space on my desk area.The most important part is the gel pad itself .Is is thick enough to be very comfortable.GREAT PRODUCT.
