3,Redone in America?????,"Um, when looking at this DVD to replace the one my 2 yr old wore out I was surprised to locate other descriptions elsewhere which talked about using american voices for the soundtrack! It appears above you can still hear the ""Alternate UK Vocal Track"" So 3 stars for changing the voices!!! Amazon you may want to revise your description. Not to mention the second story on it.As for the original Robbie it is a riot. There is so much to notice I still see new things the 50th (??) time around. My 2 yr old asks for Robbie every day. He likes to run in the reindeer games by racing around the house."
3,Ok,These are ok but if you looking for a permanent rechargable battery look elsewhere since after several uses they simply won't stay charged.
5,Best synopsis of Isreal-Palestine relations in the last thirty years,"Mr. Carter detailed the journey of the Isreal-Palestine relations in the last thirty something years. The book is unpretentiously damning of a strong view point in the United States, and ultimately reaffirmed Mr. Carter's place in modern history and the nobel peace prize award. The book is well written and easy to read."
5,Depolarizing the Middle East,"In an era of hostility and rhetoric, it is refreshing to read an author who incisively addresses the core of the Middle East conflict, not only with books but with personal involvement and mediation.Former President Carter firmly and repeatedly, over the years, has reminded both the Israelis and Arabs that vengeance is counter-productive, the gasoline on the fire, if you will. He has been present when both sides have signed treaties acknowledging Israel's right to exist as a nation within it's legal borders, and Palestine's right to sovereignty over its own treaty-defined territory.Mr. Carter very sensibly now asks both sides, ""You have all signed the treaties; isn't it now time to fulfill the agreed conditions without further delays?""One suspects that settling this matter would do more to win the middle eastern wars than would any number of military surges and suicide bombers.Keith Dahlberg"
1,"Carter Airs his Amoral, Ahistorical Views","Nothing can say more about this book than the company it keeps. Look at the books bought by people who bought this book and you see the strain of anti-Semitism throughout. Carter spreads the claptrap that the US is at fault for Palestinians strapping bombs on their children and the mentally infirm due to our support of Israel. He fails to make a connection between cause and effect -- ex: Israel building a fence causes suicide bombers, when it is clearly the bombers that created a requirement for the fence -- in an Orwellian explanation of past events that strip them of their true context to fit his world view. Don't waste your money on this book or the ones bought by its adherents."
5,A Must Read to Understand the Facts of the Israeli/Palestinian Conflict,"An excellent book from a very wordly man. I salute Mr. Carter for writing this book and documenting the histroical facts of a 50+ year old conflict. It is factual, historical with all main points outlined. I hope all can read the book and begin to realize that it is time to focus on peace and human rights for the oppressed and imprisoned Palestinians."
1,Horrible,"You really have to wonder when a former President declares in this book that Israel first attacked Jordan in the Six Day War. Mr. Carter, it is undisputed fact that Israel pleaded with Jordan not to enter the war and that Jordan initiated hostilities by attacking Israel. Only one of many glaring mistatements of historical fact. Carter never mentions his book that his PAC The Carter Center took $10,000,000 from Saudi Arabia. Hmmmmm...You have to wonder why The Carter Center has never criticised the Saudis--one of the most rampant human rights violators in the world. Carter you are a despot and a weakling for refusing to debate Professor Alan Dershowitz on the truth of the factual basis for your book. For someone who wants to open dialogue on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, how come you--a former (thank God) U.S. President, are scared to debate your book???????????? Go back to Plains."
1,"The Bumbling, Stumbling Idiot Speaks Out","Jimmy Carter, the worst President in this century has once again revealed his naive, dictator loving and semite stupidity..Do people forget that he opened the door for the Islamic Fascists in the Middle East by pulling the rug out from under the Shah of Iran..(who had his problems to be sure but was more modern and open minded than any other leader in the Middle East with the exception of Sadat)He left us with double digit inflation, interest rates and high unemployment...His foreign policy told the world that we were a paper tiger who could be pushed around...Now he embraces dictators around the world, praise Hamas and puts most of the blame on the ONLY democracy in the Middle East..What a guy, what a joke!...An American version of Neville Chamberlain (except that Chamberlain was not an anti-semite)Thank God for Ronald Reagan who repaired much of the damage done by this fan of fascists..."
1,Very regretful,"One would expect a better, more weighed aproach from Carter....Instead, he chose the easiest path - blame one side and get away with it.Not worth a penny, let alone the price."
1,Good companion volume for Mein Kampf - Mel Gibson stocking stuffer,"If this book is not an anti-semitic screed then I don't know what is. Carter obviously has a violent hatred for the Jewish people. Like most such types, he just does not have the courage to come out and say it. It's amazing the publisher actually went to press with a book with such a title."
3,an unbiased review,"My title refers to me, not Carter. It just seems to me that most of the people are who are slamming the book are doing so not because of Carter's writing, but because they disagree with his opinions.This book was interesting to be because of Carter's Christian perspective. I believe his faith played some role, however larger or small, in his writing and forming opinions. However, spending much of my academic career entrenched in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, I saw that this was the only new thing that Carter added to discussions I've already had. For anyone versed in the conflict, there is not much new here. For someone wanting to start, this book provides a good jumping off point. The writing is clear and easy. Read it, get a background, and let your opinion take you to the next place. Although Carter's work is not as neutral as I'm sure he wants it to be, a reader from any side should be able to read and be pointed in their next direction."
2,Great sadness,"No peace has ever been in the ""holy land"" nor will there ever be. How does President Carter keep optimistic?"
2,Disappointed,"Jimmy Carter is a great humanitarian, Christian and scholar, but I was so disappointed in several of his statements in this book. I am a liberal Christian like Carter, but one who knows that what is going on between Palestine and Israel is not in the least like Apartheid in South Africa. I can only continue to pray that at some point Palestine's leaders will begin to truly negotiate for peace. Palestinian extremists are doing their own people a grave disservice."
1,Jimmy Carter has lost his mind,"I read this book, twice.I can tell you with certainty that Carter has lost his mind.He confuses myth with reality and he has no idea what he is talking about.If Carter has his way, in 30 years, we will all be speaking Arabic.If you love freedom, you will hate this book."
1,Sad that Jimmy has no proof,"I was recently loaned this book to look it over. The facts were really bad and could not be substantiated. Jimmy Carter has really fallen from his once great status of a President. The book really was about pointing fingers and not backing up his facts. I wanted to give Mr. Carter a chance since he has done some great things, but I'm dubious of anyone who back dictators and goes against his own country. I feel bad for him. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Way to go Jimmy!,"I thought this book was very interesting. I learned a lot about Jimmy Hoffa. I didnt know that the teamsters were involved in israel. I guess its true that anyone can become president, and let interest rates get to 21 percent. Way to go Jimmy! Although your brother was an alchoholic, he never ruined the country, like you did. You should have stayed with peanuts."
1,The Peanut Farmer,needs to stick to growing peanuts....or building houses.Clearly biased perspective on the subject. Jimmy seems to have an axe to grind....on Israel's head if he had his way.
5,An HONEST reflection of reality,"In this book, Carter succeeded in transparently describing the middle-east crisis through his personal experience, while avoiding hypocrisy and bias. Thus, the text presents an objective and highly ordered presentation of a very misinterpreted reality..."
4,"Well written, informative, and blunt","I just finished reading it and thought that it was great. Mr. Carter does a great job of relaying his personal thoughts on the issue, from the perspective of a man who is arguably the most knowledgeable American on the subject. My only wish is that it would contain some context outside of his own observations, like reports in the news that could correlate with his insights.As someone who has not (yet) been to the Middle East, I can't imagine a better and more informative way to learn more.I wrote extensively on the subject here, including some favorite quotes:[...]"
4,Jimmy Carter's book on Israel/Palestine,"A useful book that has some important basic information on the Israeli-Palestinian struggle and an informative chronological account. It won't win a prize for writing but one hopes it will be widely read because the message is important and persuasive. The criticisms directed at Carter on the grounds that he is anti-semitic are ridiculous. If anything, he has leaned over to be fair to Israel. But the picture he paints is not pretty."
5,that is the real american thinking,"Americans must have the right for thinking about several problems, not limited to only one point of view. That is the great Carter legacy to future generations."
5,"JIMMY HITS A MEGA BINGO, AND THE ZIONIST 'LOBBY' IS FLUMMOXED","Go, Jimmy, go! It's about time that a major politico has had the guts to speak the truth about the ugly side of the Palestinian dispossession. As Norm Finkelstein has already noted elsewhere, Carter's book could have been even better, but as it is, it is still very good, well written and most useful. Carter's book title is most appropriate, as Israeli author Uri Davis also noted years ago when he wrote his revealing book, ISRAEL: AN APARTEID STATE. If the shoe fits, Zionist partisans should be 'proud' to wear it."
5,Thank you President Carter,"Once again, President Carter plays the role of peacemaker as he lays out concisely what needs to happen in Palestine if Israel and the world want to achieve a permanent peace in that region.Unfortunately, like all those who try to be objective about Israeli Palestinian relations and promote peace in that region, Carter is being smeared with the anti-semetic brush the Israeli lobby and their spokespersons, e.g. Alan Dershowitz (who's only contribution to the Israeli Palestinian peace process is a book that he plagerized from a discredited source) use to attack anyone who disagrees with them. Anyone who thinks Jimmy Carter is anti-semetic only needs to read this book to realize just how absurd that is.The future of the world depends on the implementation of the two state solution in Palestine and time is running out. Israel already has atomic weapons and Iran says it wants them also."
1,Redemption of Failure,"Redemption of a FailureJimmy Carter loves everyone who loves him. He is so desperate to redeem his reputation that he embraces dictators who have savaged their own people. He finds positive things to say about Fidel Castro even as Castro hunts down and imprisons those who voiced their opinions to Jimmy during his visits to Cuba. Jimmy neglects to mention that as he was praising Kim Jung Il for seeking the ""way of peace,"" Kim was secretly creating nuclear weapons in violation of treaties signed during Jimmy's presidency. His latest book is filled with significant factual errors. Carter totally ignores the fact that Israel offered Arafat virtually everything he demanded at the Clinton/Barak/Arafat summit. Even Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia, who was intimately involved behind-the-scenes in the Camp David peace negotiations, called Arafat's rejection of the Barak offer ""a crime against the Palestinians - in fact against the entire region."""
2,HOW SHOULD A PRESIDENT THINK,"I have no particular opinion on the situation in the Middle East. I read this book several times. It is highly disturbing to me: Not because of any favoritism toward any group in the region, but because he states and evidently believes whole-heartedly that human actions can impact natural law.The notion that any action of any sort by any president can be based at all on the notion that the economy of the universe is going to be altered is frightening. Having Alexander I Czar of Russia with all sorts of mystical notions does not endanger the survival of mankind. Having a president of the US with such a notion and the control of the H-Bomb does."
1,Carter is Clueless about the Arab-Israeli Conflict,"Unfortunately, the far-left has a tendency to support the underdog in all cases. This book is no different. Carter automatically supports the Palestinian 'victims,' but he does not realistically consider the roots and the realities of the situation."
2,Typical anti-Israel slant,"President Carter has vast knowledge of the middle east and this book proves it. While his discourse can be dry, a person who wants a better understanding of the middle east situation should read this book.Unfortunately, Mr Carter, along with so many in the world turns a blind eye to the fact that many Palestinians care more about the destruction of Israel than they do about creating the first state the Palestinians have ever had in their history. This blindness boarders on the intentional to the point of being anti Semitic and calls in the veracity of his conclusions."
3,"Carter, honest but always naive.","Perhaps someone should ask Mr. Carter about his involvements with Saudi Arabia and Jordan during the (pre-presidential) days when he had to save his farm from failure (a man of poor judgement - then and now). It is well documented that the arabs saved Carter's skin then, and he still owes them. Carter simply refuses to understand of the dynamics of middle-eastern history - as do not apparently many of those naive reviewers listed here. I at least give him credit for his not having given up on peace - although his naive tactics will never achieve any longterm peace in the region. Perhaps the opposite effect."
1,Foolish Carter,Jimmy Carter is a fool--simply put his attitude toward the Jews and Israel is wrong--Jimmy Carter is Un-American! This book is anti Israel trash.
1,Jimmy's true colors come out,I am ashamed that this is the only President that Georgia has produced so far. He is very anti=Semitic and continues to support extremist groups that want to destroy Israel. Before you make Israel the bad guy ask yourself how many Israeli children have been sent to blow themselves up to kill Palestinians?
1,Sad day,It is a sad day for people of peace and good will that a man known as a peacemaker and a protector of human rights would put his name to a book so full of historical untruths and inaccuaracies that it will only serve to inflame an already difficult situation. If he has any ethics at all he will withdraw the book and correct those mistakes. Israel has a story. Palestine has a story. They are both right and both wrong. Any honest storyteller tells both sides and then looks for a third story that leaves grievances in the past and looks for commonality. This is not that book.
5,Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,"I salute President Carter for doing one thing most of our politicians have great difficulty doing----that is to tell the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I listened to the book on CD format and was truly touched by his insight, candor and the ability to explain it all without bad mouthing anybody. However, since the US legislature has a big sign on their doors----sold to Zionist movement it is unlikely that we will see much progress in near future."
5,Excellent,A wonderful book that sheds some light on the conflict. I thank President Carter for having the courage to write a book that he must have known would not necessarily be well received. The historical facts are insightful and the perspective is realistic and respectful. Fantastic book.
4,Excellent read,mr. carter's observations on the israeli-palestinian conflict are quite revealing and pertinent to our own conflicts in the middle east. it's bewildering that the observations made in this book are not more widely publicized. the point of view is refreshing and makes one want to pause and take stock of u.s. foreign policy and how it is perceived by the world community.
5,Jimmy Carter is like good wine...,"Jimmy Carter is like good wine, he gets better with age. In ""Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid"" he has the merit to show another side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that is not shown by the popular media.The result of the US ignorance of the Middle-East can be seen in the failure of the occupation of Iraq today. There will be no peace in the Middle East until the facts detailed by Carter in this book are recognized by the US."
5,A must read,"Nothing is wrong with the truth even if it hurts. By laying out the facts and showcasing what the average palestinian deals with, he is sharing the reality on the ground. Israel is an occupier by all means and have kept the living conditions horrific. Time for a nobel peace prize winner to write about it since in the US, the average american, have felt only Israelis have rights.Great book, read it and understand what Israel is all about."
5,Truth hurts,Of course Carter will be labled as an anti-semite because he dare question the state of Israel. Ironic how Israel and the US are the most facist countries in the world today. Well at least we are politically correct facists!
5,"Thank You Jimmy, Thank you","Carter is not up for re-election and he spells out the facts as they are - as hard as they are to swallow for Israeli-apologists. Personally, I purchased 20 books to give out to my friends, with the goal of educating them on this terrible atrocity that is occuring everyday.The Palestinians are the sacrificial lambs of modern day history. We should all be ashamed of ourselves."
4,Decide for yourself,"' To those who are curious about this book, I urge you to read it for your self and decide on your own about the matter Carter treats.As for some reviews, one will note the overwhelming prevalence of attacks on the character of this Nobel Peace Prize winner. These irrelevant attacks remind one of the old saw, ""If it looks like garbage, and smells like garbage, it probably is garbage."""
4,"let's all remember, freedom of speech","Dear Amazon,Do not cave to the people who boycott you to force you into dropping President Carter's book. I don't agree with his opinion here, but learned about the situation without drawing the same conclusion.Consider the millions who order books from you each year, then look at the zealots who insist you change your business because they don't like it. How many of the boycotters are former customers?"
1,this hayseed should stick to farming,after a botched presidency one would hope this meat head would put a lid on it. since when is he such a skilled statesman and revered thinker that we need him to weigh in on a situation of this magnitude? he should stick to peanuts; adding further fuel to an already explosive controversy about which every opinion has already been expressed is useless.
2,Tell Me It Isn't True,"I always respected Jimmy Carter as a man, even when I disagreed with his politics. His humanitarian and reconciliation efforts since leaving the White House only increased that respect. Then why did he write this mean-spirited, often falacious screed against Israel? Only he can answer that.His basic premise--that American Middle East policy has tilted toward the state of Israel at the expense of real peace progress--may even be true, but he won't pursuade many readers who are truly open minded (as opposed to the close-minded majorities, both right and left) with this unbalanced and unfair revision of history.Not Recommended."
1,Not worth it,"Shoddy scholarship, plagarized maps, and Carter's own bias makes this novel into a vitriolic polemic despite pretenses at objectivity. Many facts with regard to the conflict are innacurate. To summarize: Bad scholarship, innacurate, and pedantic. Don't waste your time."
1,A Waste of Time,"A disappointing and generally naive book by a former President eager to be back in the limelight. It offers no fresh insights or revelations to make it of interest to serious students of the Middle East, and it is too encumbered with factual errors to make it useful to the general reader seeking a better understanding of that part of the world."
1,Jimmy Carter: misleading,"I am truly dismayed that Jimmy Carter has written this book. My biggest problem is not with his description of Palestinian conditions, but his characterization of ""apartheid."" Everyone knows that the connotation of ""apartheid"" is that of injustice. So blaming Israel for apartheid is like saying that they are unjust for taking measures to protect their own people. The fact that Israeli citizens' lives are threatened EVERYDAY cannot be disputed. Any country, including the US, would have reacted in a similar way. It is fine to disagree with Israeli policies, but cannot disagree that they have the right to protect their people, their families, their children. Israel is a small country, so when one family is affected by terrorism is affects many others.So while it the condition of the Palestinian people is unfortunate, everyone knows that the moment the people renounce terrorism and accept Israel's right to exist, their troubles caused by Israel will end. Simple as that."
1,A Weak Idea,"I'm really not sure what he is trying to say, but the idea is weak. After you read this book you ask yourself ""so what?"""
1,A Lousy Book By a Lousy President,"This book is absolute drivel. First, the writing is terrible. I assume Carter did not actually write the book himself, but he could have at least found a better writer to ghost write it for him. Second, in his zeal to defend the Palestinians and attack the Israelis, our former president seems to have dispensed with careful fact-checking. Where the facts support his conclusion, he states the facts. Where the facts do not support his conclusion, he either ignores the facts, changes the facts, or invents new facts. This is inexcusable. Finally, the book is so one-sided that it fails to contribute anything meaningful to the debate about a complex situation. Instead, it comes off as ranting. President Carter will go down in history as among our least effective presidents. His book is just about as good as his presidency."
1,What a waste of money,"I don't believe that Jimmy Carter actually wrote ""Peace Not Apartheid."" The naivete illustrated in this book is more indicative of a kindergartner than a former president of the United States. It is almost as though Carter is applying for work with every tin-pot dictator in the Middle East. The lack of understanding of how the world works shown by Carter in this book makes it easy to understand why he is arguably the worst president in American history. The unending hostage crisis, the worst economy since the depression and oil crisis were his legacy before he decided to become an apologist for terrorists. Was he out of the country during 9-11. I suggest that anyone who might want to buy this book would be better served just burning the money. (I gave it one star because that was the lowest rating not because it actually deserved one.)"
1,Carter: American Traitor,"Jimmy Carter's FAILED foreign policy ,the betrayal of the Shah of Iran, created the trouble in Iran and Iraq. Now, like a cat covering his mess in the litter box, he writes this terrible book to support his own position.This is an attempt to resurrect his failed presidency first and to promote the flawed liberal agenda in the Culture of Death. He is our enemy. Shun this book."
5,A Necessary Read,"This book is a great place to start when getting familiar with the Palestinian's plight. It is easy to read and gets to the point. A lot of history is provided on the surrounding Middle Eastern countries, their leaders and involvements in the current situation.I've read a lot of the reviews by newspapers, etc. and I personally do not feel that they do it justice. The book focuses on Palestine, but that does not mean it is one sided. Carter states deficiencies by the Palestinian government.Carter brings to the public the truth of the situation. He doesn't hide behind American-Israeli interests and instead steps out of the shadows of mainstream American media. I hope that more Americans will read this and begin to do their own research as I have.I highly recommend this book to anyone who cares about humanity and human life and those who wish to make a difference in the world."
5,Breaking the the AIPACS Iron Grip,"If Carter wrote this book while he was running for President or the Senate, he would be comitting political suicide, as anyone would if they are mildly critical of Israel.The Israeli lobby must be exposed for what it is: A vey powerful organization that favors the Interest of Israel at the expense of American interest. Their funding and influence to promote the APARTHEID Israel, effectively misinforms the entire country of what is going on in Palestine. The Racism that takes place their is apparent to the whole world, but not in the US. It is 10 times worse than what took place in SA.Its time to Protect American Interests and do whats best for Israelis and Palestinians.Carter is the greatest and most compassionate US president and he should be recognized for his work and courage."
1,"A failed President. A failed man, A Failed book","Typical left wing, Jimmy Carter anti-Israel bias. Jimmy Carter, the worst President in U.S. history and a long time lover of the Arab nations that hate the U.S., continues to pick the wrong side of all political issues.The book is filled with inaccuracies, lies and bias. There is no mention of the fact that Israel has reached out it's hand for peace with all of its Arab neighbors numerous times only to be met with violence and a constant commitment to their destruction. Remember one thing that sums up the entire situatuion Carters' book discusses: If the Arabs laid down their arms, there would be peace in the middle east. If Israel laid down their arms, there would be no Israel. Amazing how much support there is a for a nation of terrorists that were dancing in the streets celebrating 9/11."
1,"zero stars, but they dont leave that option","Its good to see that one of the worst presidents ever, who was swept out office in a landslide after 4 years of malaise, is keeping busy. Unfortunately, this dictator hugging buffoon should stick to building for the poor, not writing about someting he has no idea about, which is effective foreign policy. Being the king of all paper tigers, this man is qualified to run a peanut farm, not try and resurrect a failed predidential legacy. Avoid this drivel unless you are just a complete Kool-Aid Drinker of the DNC and left wing of American politics."
1,jimmy carters foolishness,"jimmy carter new book is a testament to how little he actually knows about the current palestinian-israeli conflict. If one were to go back in history and look at Carters views they would understand where i am coming from. For example Carter once told Fidel Castro how sorry he is about the way the U.S. treated him. Carter uses the approach that Israel has tanks, and fighter planes while all the palestinians have are rocks. This is false. The palestinian militias are armed with advanced technology smuggled in throught the philedelphia corridor from Egypt, not incuding weapons from Syria. Carter uses the seperation barrier as a tool against Israel, accusing it of disrupting the Palestinians lives. Isral put up the barrier to stop suicide bombings which have decreased by more than 90% since the barrier has been put up."
1,Jimmy Carter should move to Syria,"Jimmy Carter has gone overboard in his anti-semitic, uninformed ramblings of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. He has purposely omitted key information showing how Israel has bent over backwards in trying to attain peace. Jimmy Carter's book is perfect for all Al-Qaeda members and all anti-semites -otherwise, it's only use is to prove that Jimmy Carter has truly lost his mind."
1,The Anti-Semite Revealed,"Jimmy Carter was a disgrace as a President. Under his administration we had interest rates of 16 percent and a completely failed foreign policy. Here was the genesis of our difficulties with Iran when he allowed them to hold our hostages for over a year, showing complete weakness as he suffered through a 'malaise'. Now Carter disgraces himself once again and reveals himself to be an anti-Semite who places all blame on Israel. He blithely glosses over historical facts i.e. that Israel was attacked by the Arabs on the day the UN brought it into being and has continued to be attacked by Arabs all through its history. Sharon gave back territory and what has he gotten for it - continued attacks from the Palestinian territories, showing the Palestinians for what they truly are - terrorists and murderers. Shame on you Mr. Carter."
1,Jimmy: It's all about you,"Jimmy: The fact that you put your face on the cover shows it's really all about your egomania. You can't make that the idealist's claim that the issue is ""bigger than you""."
1,Whishful thinking or cheer blindness?,I've never read a book so biased as this one. Mr. Carter case cannot be taken seriously. The book is so biased that the effect could be almost comical.
1,"Oh My, What a disappointment...","Historical revisionism. Terrible, just terrible. So many falsehoods, and ""Lies of Omission"" which as Orwell noted, are the worst kind of lie. I admired the guy for some of his stands early on, but one gets the feeling, his contemptuous and unfair treatment of the Jews of Israel might be an indicator of his own pro-Muslim sentiments, as when he helped organize the return of the Ayatollah Khomeini into power in Iran. We all saw what happened there. Does he wish the same awful fate for the Israelis? Even the book cover shows him facing against the anti-terror wall which the Israelis built, and which has cut the level of suicide bombers down to its lowest levels in decades. He clearly takes the side of the Muslim fanatics over the democratic and secular Israeli society, and does so by making a train wreck of authentic history and current events. Sad, very sad."
3,"Please be nice to Jimmy carter, to Jews, to Arabs and to all human.","I am apalled by all the commnents here. So polarized. Stop throwing muds and have a good discussion. We want peace and prosperity for all, not for some. All human are equal and bleed same blood and have transferable organs. Please do not do name calling. This is a book I like but that does not mean all isarelis are bad and carter never said that. It is the same way not all Americans voted for the war and supported Bush. Jewish Americans are same as any other americans. We all are human, created equal. Dont blame a person, blame a process. PEACE."
5,Extremely thought provoking,"After reading some of the reviews of President Carter's latest book and the defections from the Carter Center because of it, I was at first apprehensive about buying this book. I am glad I bought it and enjoyed reading it.We too often only hear one side of the ongoing Middle East conflict. True peace will only come about when the radicals on both sides of the conflict are deposed and those serious about peace come to power. It seems that many of those who have lead both Israel and the Palestinians have used the ongoing conflict to strengthen their hold on the people and were more interested in their own power than the welfare of those they were to represent. All President Carter did was to call them for it."
5,"Finally, the truth","President Carter is alone in speaking truth about the Palestinian/Israeli problem. Others speak of the need for honesty and straight talk about the range of government affairs, but go mute when Israeli theatment of Palestinians is discussed. Considering the flak he will get from this book, President Carter is truly a ""Profile in Courage."""
1,The man is a biased bigot light-weight...,"He was incompetent when he was President. And, he still remains so.The book is shallow, patronizing drivel... If he wants some quality of insight he should read Netanyahu's work and study the history of the region and of Israel's ongoing good faith... I can't believe this self-serving propaganda is even published..."
1,Some people never learn,"This book was written by the same Jimmy Carter who embraced the ailing Soviet despot Leonid Brezhnev and kissed - I emphasize - kissed him three times on his cheeks, the way only General Secretaries of fraternal parties were allowed to do. This happened at their meeting in Vienna in the late 1970s. Even Brezhnev himself was stunned. Perhaps this failed one time president suffering from acute megalomania, tried to elevate himself to a level of the General Secretary. I happen to believe that these kisses emboldened Mr. Brezhnev to invade the neighboring Afghanistan with impunity.Many people learn from their mistakes, but not the author of this book. For a proof, read the book."
2,Carter is still trying to see the world in black and white,"While the Arab world cries crocodile tears for the Palestinians, Carter suggests Israel is an apartheid state, and he supports Hugo Chavez, too. Perhaps Carter is still trying to make up for his youth in segregated Georgia. The problem is the Arab-Israeli issue is not about oppression by whites against dark-skinned people. That is a moronic call. It is about a society of people raised from birth to hate Jews, and that society is teaching the next generation to hate Jews. Every charge levelled against Israel is actually one that should be levelled against the Islamists who want only their race, their creed in control of every inch of the Middle East, then Europe, then....? The big review done by Jeff Goldberg is the best review on this book so far. It is so good that Arabs are suggesting Amazon be boycotted unless it is taken down. So much for a free exchange of ideas..."
2,My Former Favorite President !,"For decades Jimmy Carter had been my favorite President because he is a humanitarian, environmentalist and advocate for the endangered species act and wildlife conservation. However, this one-sided, biased book that maligns Isreal, the only Democracy in the Middle East, is dangerous and inhumane. I understand the plight of the Palestinians. But they need a leader akin to a Nelson Mandela or Mahatma Gandhi. Israel is a civilized and secular nation. They want peace. Jimmy Carter's book will further incite the millions of brainwashed religious zealots that want to massacre Israel. The timing of this divisive book could not be worse. And I used to think that Carter was a man who condemned violence. He essentially gives terrorists a pass in ""Palestine Peace Not Apartheid""."
1,This is a book? Wake UP,"This self important demented old man actually thinks people care about his opinion. He knows nothing about Israel or the struggle these people and knows nothing about pretty much any issue that he seems to want to meddle in. He feels this way just because he once had the title President of the United States, and for this he thinks he deserves a respectful ear, he is by far with very few exceptions, the worst, most stupid, most ineffective president the United States ever had, and he should really go quietly in the good night and leave his opinion out of an issue like the Israeli-Arab conflict, it is complicated and as very few reviewers seem to want to mention, brought on by wanton Arab oppression of their own people and the Arab leaderships desperate need to heat up the conflict to direct attention and energies away from their own crimes. Jimmy, shut up and dissapear already, your opinion is stupid, and your lifes work amounts to absolutely nothing."
4,Put Politics Aside,"Without regard to one's pollitical perspective, this book is well written and proffers real solutions to the mideast crisis that impacts the entire world. Considering political perspective, it is interesting to note that Carter must reconcile his liberal viewpoint and his born-again Christian frames of reference. That would seem as difficult as spanning the cultural gap between the interests of the middle east, and Carter accomplishes both with logic and sensitivity. This book would be five stars if it included more on implementation and less on theory."
3,Carter has done a courageous job,"your opening editorial review is unfairly biased however. How often do I find that harsh an opinion before I even get started...rarely.I found the book honest, revealing and full of wisdom. Just like it's author. Those who support the Israeli right will no doubt criticize heavily, but none of them with any honesty could say we have had a balanced dialogue about this in the US - unlike Israel where it is common conversation. Thank you Pres Carter for making an effort."
3,Palestine: No easy solutions without sincerity and fair play!,"The book leaves many questions unanswered. The issue is not that simple and even though Carter tried hard, he wasn't able to (or for that matter, no one could) find a resolution to the conflict that has plagued the Middle East for decades. What is required is sincerity, commitment,vision and fair play; unfortunately none of the leaders in the region are willing to embrace these much touted values."
1,"WEAK, SLOPPY, AND DISHONEST !!!","Another sad attempt to bash our President and cover over the mistakes of his own ""presidency""!"
1,"JIMMY BOY, YOU FAILED AGAIN","In this Mr. Carter displayed what can only be called bias. He complains about ""the Wall"", which is designed to keep out terrorists, not illegal immigrants. He had little to say about the Palestinian citizens of Israel (1/5 of Israel's population) who do not rise up to help their Palestinian brothers, even during the height of the intifada. One must ask ""Why?"".Why does Carter forget that in '67 Arab Armies from the West Bank, Golan Heights, and Gaza invaded Israel? Why does he forget that in '64 the ""teritories"" were firmly in Arab control, and yet the Palestine Liberation Organization was formed - WHAT did they plan to ""liberate""? Clearly it was Israel scheduled for ""liberation""! Mr. Carter has turned a blind eye to so much of the Israeli situation, so much that the book seems to be mere propaganda. Dee"
1,Revisionism at its Worst,"As a historian, I am appalled by President Carter's obvious lack of scholarship and attention to the most basic truths about the Middle East. You don't have to be fanatically pro-Israel to recognize how dangerous this book is, how inappropriate it is to refer to Israel as an apartheid state, and how fundamentally incorrect that basic premise is. Carter, as a ""scholar,"" continues to go for cheap dramatic thrills rather than historical accuracy. If you're pro-Palestinian and you want to learn actual facts about your heritage or your cause, don't be tempted to follow Carter blindly down his clearly ill-informed Yellow Brick Road to a land that does not exist. If you're pro-Israel, well, you've heard all this garbage before anyway, so you shouldn't be very surprised. But you should be angry."
1,Don't Buy this Book,This is a biased book that does not take into account the human aspect of the conflict and that the solution of the Palestinian organizations like Hamas is to kill the Israel Jews.I am disappointed in Jimmy Carter.
1,anti-Semitism thinly cloaked,"Carter has been the voice of the extreme left - Israel haters. When you have accomplished little and crave the spot light, what better way that to find a cause that will garner the adoration of the multitude haters of Israel around the world, the left-wing media, and the growing radical Jihad movement?Carter's book is yet another platform for spewing his hateful agenda. Don't waste your money... unless you're looking for more material to bolster and justify your anti-Semitic rhetoric."
1,lies,"Here's a classical example of how pure antisemitic views turn to history rewriting. Pure anti Israeli and anti Jewish propaganda. Too bad people believe these lies (if they really want to). Carter does not justifies his claims, nor does he give a realistic perspective of the Palestinian problem. Read Mike Evans, Joan Peters for a historical approach to the problem."
1,Horribly inaccurate,This book is filled with so many inaccuracies and outright lies that it is a disgrace. A freshman in college writing something like this would get a failing grade. The misrepresentations and distortions are so glaring as to render this volume a useless piece of drivel.
5,GREAT BOOK !,"A great and objective view of the conditions in Israel and Palestine.Bravo for Carter ! Israel and America, wake up !"
2,Anti semitic view from a renegade.,"With all due respects to a former U.S. President, Jimmy Carter never appeared as a strong leader to the world. Now that he is no longer an active President, instead of withdrawing to the background, Jimmy Carter is traveling around the world scheduling meetings with terror group such as Hamas AS IF he is representing the U.S. States Department.In my personal opinion, this book is basically just that. It's about a failed President who is trying to take political matter into his own hands. What is worse is that he did not provide an unbiased view of the situation. Israel was portrayed very unfairly in this book. There are many things Carter could do but instead he chose to be a political renegade running around in the world political arena."
4,The Middle East described and solutions offered,"The former President Carter describes the history of the major players in the Middle East in relation to israel and offers his solutions to bringing about peace. He is obviously a smart man and this book is concise in its approach to offering solutions with the different players involved. What I enjoyed are some of the small incidents that he experienced on his trips, that I wont reveal here, but offer some interesting humor to this book."
5,Bravo,Dear Mr.President. You took the risk and wrote about what you have observed over decades of direct engagement and observation. You too have paid the price of saying things as you see it.
2,Not Art...,"This book is not worth it. The size of it is deceiving. It is not art, nor is it a real collectors item. The majority of the images appear in workout magazines and are easily accessible. There is no text (which implies it has one sole purpose) and the images in the magazines are much larger than what appears in this book. The only thing this book is truly useful for is cutting up and using for a high school girl's dream poster for her bedroom."
4,thoughtful grindcore,"I'm not really a fan of Brutal Truth's brand of grindcore, with low-tuned guitars and constant blast beats, but there is a certain intelligence to it. And contrary to what some brainless bigot wrote in a review below, I think it took a lot of guts for a metal band to write a song like ""Anti-Homophobe."" In a genre so full of meaningless macho posturing, thoughtful lyrics like this are pretty refreshing. I agree completely with what the lyrics say: ""I may not be gay/But I don't care if you are/Live your life in peace/(...) if they laugh."" In general, Brutal Truth represent everything that can be so good about metal-- rage against the injustices and stupidity in the world. I wish I liked their music a little more, but they definitely have my respect."
1,"Failed amp module, no support",Sounded great. Articulate and powerful bass response- for a while.The power amp module died shortly after the warranty expired. The JBL repair center called after three weeks to tell me that JBL will no longer sell replacement amp modules. I'll probably salvage the speaker and toss the rest in the dumpster. The cabinet isn't high enough to use as a coffe table.JBL is still selling the PB12 but will not provide parts for them. They will exchange the sub while it's under warranty. After that you're on your own. Keep your receipt.I'll think long and hard before spending money on JBL products again.
1,Sound greats if it works,This unit sounds great for a reasonable price. Too bad it does not last due to the fault amp. I bought both PB10 & 12 and they all died on me in less than a year. What a waste of money!STAY AWAY FROM THIS BEAST OR PURCHASE SOME SORT OF REPLACEMENT WARRANTY.
1,I will never buy another JBL,"I am on my second subwoofer. The first failed within 6 months and it was under warranty so JBL replaced it. The second one did not even last 2 years and it started making loud noises and distorting. It will not even play now without major distortion. Needless to say it is out of warranty and I have a nice plant stand now that says JBL on the front of it. Save your money do not buy any JBL subwoofers, they are garbage!!! I have since purchased a SVS and it is like night and day, nice product and I would highly recommend them to everyone."
1,worked great for 2 yrs,"I too stand among the people who have found this sub, very sub par.It started to blow fuses. Then I find out there aren't any replacment parts.Never again JBL.I tell everyone I know about how JBL leaves customers out to dry. Where's the customer service?"
1,JBL PB12 SUX,"I would say that JBL just had a bad batch of amps from this third party company who they no longer deal with.I bought my PB12 in 2001 from BEST BUY and luckily I got extended service plan that coves the damn thing for 4 years. Well about 4 months ago it died. No power, no nothing. I guess it went to sleep and never woke up. I got a new one from Best Buy cuz it was under extended warrenty. Now I'm very scared to even crack up my sub to even half way.I have other JBL front speakers that bought for $800/pair and they ROCK, no problem what so ever. I think its just the BAD AMP Module in these JBL PB12's that are bad which are not really made by JBL. They are made by some 3rd party vendor.Hope this helps someone..."
1,Another disgruntled buyer -- Stay away from JBL,"I guess I should consider myself one of the lucky ones. My PB12 lasted almost 3 years... today it died. Same as everyone else's. Blown fuse... replace fuse... loud buzz... blown fuse... JBL's web site shows the amp assembly as unavailable.By the way, JBL isn't JBL anymore. They were bought out by Harman (of Harman-Kardon fame), as was Infinity.For the sake of principal, I will avoid all three from this point forward."
2,hmmm...,"This sub worked phenomenally for a few months... but I noticed a couple months ago that the mighty bass has been brought down to nothing more than a whisper- it powers on and detects the input (which is apparently a step better than everyone else who's bought it), but the sub barely fires- i have to actually TOUCH the driver to make sure its working. irritating."
1,didnt last long,"I had one of these subs (the original DPS-12 that is) and sure enough, buzz-pop and deathly silence once the amp blew up.If so many people have had this problem, surely JBL are selling really bad products ...can anyone say class-action?I guess I'll go with a company that has real customer service and a reliable product, like SVS , B&W etc."
1,Same as evryone else. Amp blew right after warranty.,"Sounded great for a year. Then loud popping and buzzing. I got it fixed under warranty. It was a fuse. The good times lasted about 3 months before I came home to a dead sub. No little red lights, no power, no nothing. I took it in to a shop and guess what? Amp module is bad but, they don't sell it anymore. WTF?!?! It's only a year and a half old! It's out of warranty so I think I'm screwed. Hey, at least I have a $350.00 paper weight. DAMN YOU JBL!!!!UPDATE: Only 7 years late. LOL. After the woofer blew I contacted JBL on this issue and they paid for me to ship it back to them and then sent me out the updated version of this woofer. Kudos to JBL on great costomer service."
3,Very Good Subwoofer But Bad Amp,"I bought this subwoofer about 4 months ago. It was working fine up until last week when I got up and noticed that the red leds were not on. At first I thought the unit was not recieving power, but after checking all of that I concluded it had to be the amp. I have read some other reviews by customers on this product complaining of the same thing. JBL must of shipped these things out with some faulty amps because it wouldn't turn on at all and there wasn't a power surge that hit it. I have all my home theatre products hooked up to a monster cable power center. Luckily I bought a service plan at the place I bought it cuz u only get 1 year from JBL. Good product but watch out for the faulty amp. Hopefully they will put in a good amp and this will never happen again."
1,Don't buy this unit,"Although I was pleased with the sound quality of the JBL NSPB12it did not last long. After only two months, the unit failed. Service with JBL has been a nightmare. I have taken it to a factory authorized service center who indicated that this was typical of the PB12 and parts were back ordered, that was 4 months ago. Trying to get some support from JBL is VERY disappointing. Therefore, I would NOT recommend their products."
1,Don't even bother!,"The thing sounds awesome when it works, unfortunately it won't work for long. In the past three years, I've now gone through three of these, two of which were replaced by the dealer. Now the third has blown (keeps blowing fuses, even with nothing hooked up to it). I even got a top-of-the-line protection circuit for it because they were telling me it was blowing because of other things in my house - riiiight.For what this unit costs, it shouldn't have these problems, even at the discounted [price]Don't think I'll be buying any JBL products any more!"
1,JBL Junk!,Didn't work from day one! I will never buy a JBL again! Read all the reviews. I didn't and I'm paying for it.
2,I too am a victim of the sub par SUB,"Worked well for the first 18 months, then boom, turned on the Surround Sound to be greeted by thunderous static and feedback. I'm glad it didn't fry my relatively new Sony receiver. I for one would love to be included in a class action lawsuit for something that was relatively expensive that cannot be repaired for a reasonable amount.I will never buy another JBL product again, and will be sure to let everyone I know who are always buying equipment not to touch them."
1,The E250P will die on you!,"Great subwoofer WHILE IT LASTS! I had a PB12, same subwoofer except it was a down-firing design. Exact same circuit board! I mostly used it for TV audio. It died 3 months after the 1 year warranty was up. I found out on the internet that was typical, and JBL would not repair them! It was a flawed design!So I contacted the the Harman Consumer Group (JBL) and they sold me a replacement E250P for about $250. This one lasted almost 2 years! It has the exact same circuit board as the PB12, and the exact same fried componentsI Good luck with your JBL piece of junk!"
4,I REALLY got lucky,"I bought the JBL PB-12 in 2002 and have had zero problems. I have no idea what the chance of that was, but I'm thankful given all the angst in the other postings. It's 2011, nine years later and am planning on continuing to use it. Or I can use these postings to convince my wife that it ""died"" and we need an upgrade......"
5,Wow! What a refreshing spiritual Christian recharge!,"Stunned at how worshipful and spiritually solid this book is, I found it more than just another book of inspirational Christian poetry. This volume exudes richly edifying concepts based directly upon scripture instead of solely upon personal experience. Each selection stirs my heart and spurs me to greater spiritual devotion as a Christian. Combined with the spectacular artwork and illustrations, this book awakens me every day to a fresh dimension in my Christian life. In fact, it now rests next to my Bible on my nightstand ready to infuse sustenance into my soul after a long day. No other devotional book has inspired me like this one. If you are looking for a refreshing and relevant devotional tool grounded in scripture, prompting your heart toward God, you've found it! Five stars."
4,Head and shoulders better than the first,"Now this is what I'm talking about. This album should have been the first release. PMD makes a big come back with his second solo effort. The beats are way better than the first and the lyrics sounds like lyrics from a classic EPMD album. The album is grimy, dope pure hip hop. With dope appearances by the Hit squad, this album is a must have for all EPMD fans."
3,Name is Misleading,"We did receive the correct product and the taste was actually pretty good. However, the name ""Cherry Berry"" is misleading since the product is mostly apples with some blueberries and a few strawberry pieces. We went through three bags before we ever found a cherry."
2,Wrong Item,"I was looking forward to this item, but I was sent the cheaper, non-organic version twice. Amazon informed me that they couldn't guarantee when the problem would be fixed. If someone orders this and gets the organic version, please post. I'd love to buy these in the future!"
2,Back to wrong product again.,"I had the exact same experience as ""Heather"" shown below. They sent me the less expensive NON-ORGANIC version of this product TWICE and then informed me that they couldn't guarantee when the problem would be fixed.Remember that strawberries and cherries are on every list for crops containing the most pesticide. Now add that freeze dried snacks are concentrated. Finally, take these concentrated levels and place them in a small child or toddler's body and their pesticide exosure goes through the roof. Do the math.Note to Amazon: This is a great product with fruit ""and nothing else"" in its ingredients. Please retain it and get it right to benefit the scores of us that enjoy providing healthy treats for our kids."
5,"Great Product, Great Price!","This is an excellent buy. Not only does it have a long expiration date of at least a year, but it also includes just organic fruit! Since apples are number two on the list of foods most contaminated with pesticides, it is important to make sure they are organic. This snack is 100% organic, so obviously there are little to no pesticides.Contrary to popular belief, the fruit does come in the pieces just like it does in the store, the shipping process doesn't wreck it in the least. The taste is great and it is very easy to enjoy this light and flaky snacks a few packs at a time.The only flaw is the fruit dust. The package is constructed in a way that leads to a bunch of dust accumulating at the bottom of the pack. For getting the most out of your package and optimizing cleanliness, I recommend cutting the pack down to size when about half if finished, otherwise about 6 or 7 pieces will remain at the bottom, but you will be bombarded by fruit dust when they are retrieved."
3,Also didn't get the right product,"UPDATE: did receive the ""organic"" version with the replacement shipment. great Amazon customer service! The snacks taste good - but as someone else mentioned, mostly apple with a few berries.I ordered the organic dried snacks but received the regular ones - even though the outside cardboard box was labeled organic. Wrote to amazon customer service and received very prompt reply saying that a new order was placed and I should be receiving the replacemnt soon. Don't know if the replacement will be organic?"
2,the horse lingo is hard to follow,"I found the horse lingo hard to follow, and therefore lost interest in the book. Those first chapters moved at a very slow speed as well."
1,The lack of depth of this book is unfortunate.,"I was looking forward to reading this book because I have seen so many wonderful characters within the horse and competition world. Alas, this book never even comes close. The character development was inconsistent and there are mysterious references to changes in religion which were not explained or woven into the plot. There were glaring faults related to the details of equestrian competition and training. And, for those who do not leave books unfinished, the author reverts to a convenient and abrupt end. The reader is left perplexed and unsatisfied. Jilly Cooper, you have nothing to fear."
2,Boring unless you have a great interest in horses.,"Barn Blind is full of horses. Since I have no real interest in horses, I found the endless descriptions of training and shows a bit boring. The characters are interesting, but for some reason I didn't develop a real fondness for any of them."
1,don't wast your time,"im sorry jane-but this book was so boring. you develop the characters for the first 6 chapters and nothing really happens in those chapters. I mean john screws up, margaret crys, henry spys on John, kate and axel fight and thats about it. the last chapter is alright but there's no point to the book. All it does is just explain this family's daily life and it talks way too much about horses. So, unless you have a couple hours to spare (even though i just summarized the book) and your sanity, buy a different book."
4,Useful in Internet World,"David Stauffer gives out some reasons why Cisco is so successful in the Internet industry. Among all the factors, I think ...people¡ is the most important one. It is because they can generate creative ideas for the company and so they are valuable asset. The term ...internet ecosystem¡ and last minute management¡ are important terms as well."
4,Great book for Town & Country Repair,I'll keep this brief. I bought the Haynes and the Chiltons to perform a lot of routine functions on my 1993 Town and Country. The Chilton's had a prettier cover on it but the Haynes had the guts that I always used to get the job done right. Take brakes for example. The Haynes diagrams and explanations made it very easy. The Chiltons were incomplete.
2,Haynes Dodge Plymouth Chrysler Mini-Vans 1984-1995,This book is very weak on electrical information. It has only partial wiring diagrams and really only covers the most basic of problems. Guess I should have listen to the reviewer that gave the book to his kids...
4,"Well illustrated, covers all maintenace tasks, most repair","The manual starts with an introduction to the models covered (All FWD models listed in the title, no AWD), tools required, safety advice and a brief trouble shooting guide. Then covers full strip down of engine,transmission, fuel, exhaust and electrical systems. Too brief chapter on body. The comprehensive diagrams and pictures are the strongest point of the Haynes manuals, and make them better than the far more expensive official workshop manuals as far as the average home mechanic is concerned. I have a V6 3.0 liter version, and can vouch for the manual for this model, the torque wrench settings, clearances etc. are accurate. No experience using it for the other engines. The manual does assume some experience for the major tasks like engine rebuilds, but assumes little or none in describing routine maintenance."
4,Thorough manual,I used this manual to fix a lot of problems with my Dodge Gran Caravan and found it very helpful on many occasions.
2,Lacking for 2nd generation,"Book was okay for our 1989 Voyager, but comes up severly lacking when it comes to the 1993 we have now. Lots of generalities that have to be updated from the 1980's examples. Most pictures do not cover the later models. I'm now looking for a Chrysler published manual to fill in the gaping holes."
5,Costume Makers Inspiration,"If you make costumes or just like to browze the fashions of the 1800's, you will enjoy this. Harper's Bazar has always done wonderful fashion layouts."
4,Great Book!,"26 Italian Songs and Arias is definitly more authoritative than the G. Schirmer. I love the phonetics, translations, and notes.However, the book can be disappointing. The added ornamention is clumsy most of the time, and the accompaniments are harder to play, and not as supportive for young singers. This book is great for reference, since it contains information on the composers, suggestions for ornaments, and accurate translations. But I wouldn't use it for a beginning singer."
2,Facts for travel,"This book contains the same information in the beginning of any guide book regarding money, transport, health......but no specific details. It is a compilation of articles written about different type of travel such as hitchiking, cargo boats... It is a general overview with no details on travel around the world...just bits and pieces."
4,Traveler's Handbook Rules!,"This book was very informative. We are planning an around the world trip next year and this book created a great starting point with many chapters to stimulate your thinking. We really enjoyed the listing of all the countries with information on ""when to travel"", ""safety"", and ""visas"" required. It also provided local phone numbers and addresses around the world to reach incase of an emergency. We will definitely bring this book on our travels!"
1,Lost,One Music Video + One drawn out Advertisement for Bikini Bandits = Not worth $10.Save your $10 and use it to purchase the APC DVD due out in November.
3,Get it right.,If your gonna advertise something as Uncensored and Uncut... dont blur stuff out. That defeats the purpose of releasing an Uncensored dvd.
3,hmmmm...,"well i think it was okay. made me laugh actually. i mean guys dont take everything to serious. i feel bad for the people who were expecting something wonderful.....its okay not to like this, and if it makes you dislike the band even more, oh well, thats all on you. its not like i'm going to get all huffy and puffy about it.it's just a dvd for the outsider single. maybe next time you guys should read."
1,DVD SIngle?,"I was at the show in Rochester, and I could've sworn Maynard said there was a ""live"" DVD coming out. But I guess I was a little innebriated at the time so I could be mistaken. Regardless, if you like the video that much record it off MTV and save your money. Cause the Bikini Bandits stuff is pretty corny. I was waiting for that live version of ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"". Support the band, buy the albums, but if you don't want to lose money, stay away from the Bermuda Triangle."
1,What a waste of $$$,"What a waste of money. I am as much of a Tool and APC fan as anyone else here. But I was utterly disappointed with this music DVD. I thought it was infantile to say the least. It was Maynard's idea to make this DVD and it must have taken a hell of a lot convincing for the other members of APC to go ahead with this, but the fact that they did go ahead with it shows they are sorely lacking in judgement. They have targeted the lowest common denominator with this one, completely disappointed!"
2,The video for The Outsider is terrible,"Who wants it on DVD? I thought this foolishness would end with ""The Nurse who Loved Me"". Apparently not. I was appalled when I saw this video. Please, guys, stick to what you guys do best: cryptic animation that at least implies the esoteric."
2,Well,"I really don't care to much for it. The song is my lest fav of the album. And yeah its stuped. But the Bikini Bandits have been around befor APC, so it wasnt really even there idea your bashing. And how come Tool is even apart of the covo at all?Maynard is NOT Tool, he's a part of Tool, the image the music, its Justin Danni and Adam TOO. Its not even close to the same band? Dont diss tool if you dont like APC.Maynard is a good lead singer, and writtes amazing lyrics, but thats all he does,...theres alot more to a band then ONe dude. And why does he have to make gold everytime, its a $10 DVD of a joke video, boho. So because it sucks and compleatly difrent bands whole work and legacy now are crap? I mean theres not much better these days. If you want better music, listen to Zeppelin."
3,"Not great, but....","I really excited when I heard APC was coming out with a DVD. When I put it in the player, however, I was a bit disappointed with the results. It's basically just Bikini Bandits stuff and APC happened to help them with the music. It's not exactly an APC DVD as I was lead to believe.The Bikini Bandits stuff is entertaining to some extent. It's basically low comedy porn (...). I wouldn't recommend unless that's what you're into.However, I will say that I don't think this is Maynard ""selling out"" as this is something he enjoys. It's deliberately cheesy and over the top and he wanted to do it for fun. It's not the usual great art we get from APC (or Tool, Maynard's other band), but it isn't meant to be."
1,"Terrible DVD, but better one upcoming","I love ""the outsider"" but this video ruins the song. i could care less about the bikini bandits. if you want a real good DVD by a perfect circle, on november 16 they will release a live one calle AMOTION. pass on this and wait"
2,Photo is NOT Accurate,"The photo that is used to represent the product shows the FOURTH edition of the book, and I was sent the THIRD edition. Yeah, it seems like that kind of stuff wouldn't matter, but when you're a college student using amazon.com to get textbooks and you need to get a certain edition, it makes all the difference. So now I'm beyond bummed.The product was shipped promptly though, which is the only reason this has two stars instead of one."
5,Series Maintains High Style and Adventure,"Harold Schechter's Edgar Allen Poe mystery series is one of my favorites, and I was pleased to find the third one just as engrossing as its predecessors. The books, written in the first person, freely adopt Poe's literary style--sometimes to comedic effect. Schechter does poke affectionate fun at Poe now and again, but not at the cost of dehumanizing the character. His Poe feels like a warm and admirable (if pretentious and squeamish) human being. Schechter, who is more commonly known as the writer of many above average historical true crime books, handles the adventure adroitly, too. For the full flavor, I would recommend that new readers begin with Nevermore. While the books could be taken out of order (if not without losing some context), Nevermore is powerful at establishing Poe as a character and really shouldn't be missed."
4,"Beautifully wirtten, though a little gory","Let me first say that I am a huge fan of Edgar Allan Poe and I will forever be one. One of the main reasons I bought this book was because Poe was in it. Now, this book was just beautifully written. The historical data required to make this book come alive must have taken months to collect.The whole story line centers around Mr. Poe and ""Kit"" Carson trying to track down a murderer by the nickname of the ""Liver-Eater."" The murderer brutally scalps his victims and mutulates their bodies almost past recongition. It was very thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.However, there was one problem for me. As I said before, I'm a HUGE Poe fan. Despite this, the way Mr. Schechter detailed every murder victim was just a little too much for me. Despite the goriness of the book, it was a fantastic read and has the best twist at the end."
5,A Provocative Page-Turner,"I read a review of this book in Vanity Fair that said ""Dirty hits a vein"" and that pretty much says it all. The book is a page-turner--Maran makes you root for the 3 kids she writes about till you're on the edge of your seat, wondering what'll happen to them next. Her writing is beautiful, but you hardly notice it because the story is so compelling. The points she makes by telling the kids' stories come through, but you don't feel you're being preached to. Rather, you feel you're on the wild ride Maran went on with these kids, and as she did, you come to love and respect them in the process. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good read, parent or not!"
1,phone not recvd after 8 days,Orderd on Sep 2 said two three days deliver today is 10th and have not received merchandise. Shipper in same state as me.. dont look like I will get merchanside either
5,Alejandro at his best!,"Not only the opening themes from ""La Venganza Será Terrible"", but also lots of great songs that he created.If you are looking for the book (Bar del Infierno (Spanish Edition)), I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this has nothing to do with the book, but a common name.A great CD from the dearest friend Alejandro."
3,A book with an unknown voice,"As a giant fan, I enjoyed all the references to beloved Jane Austen books. Too bad most of the reading enjoyment was wrapped up in those references. Character development was slow, and while it did improve over the course of the novel, when I finished the book I still didn't know who was talking. Whose story was this? While literate, I found it unsatisfying."
2,I don't get it,I truly think I missed the point of the book. Perhaps I don't have a talent for reading Jane Austen book discussions.
1,The Jane Austen Book Club,"Despite some portions of the book that are quite interesting and even humorous, on the whole I found the book to be profoundly boring. I would have set the book aside if it were not for the fact that my Book Group had chosen this as our monthly selection. So, I plowed through it. Come to find out the Book Group was unanimous in their appraisal that this was one boring book! The book reads like a soap opera and the movie does likewise.However, there is one redeeming value to the book: It does offer some insights into some of the possible dynamics of book groups. Yet, this is not justification enough to read the book."
3,"Not my favorite of Fowler's, but still fun.","When I found out that _TJABC_ had been made into a movie, I figured I'd better re-read it (in part to find out just how egregiously the film-makers tarted up the story for the big screen - judging by the trailer, *quite* egregiously).It's a fun short novel that doesn't ask for an emotional commitment. I can imagine Fowler writing this as r&r; after finishing Sister Noon. Her dry, wry style saw me through. But there's not quite enough there there for me to revisit these particular characters a third time."
3,Some good moments.,"Six people form a book club to discuss Jane Austen's works.Each chapter is based on a different Austen novel, as well as the life of the book club member hosting the monthly meeting.This comedy of manners is more about the intertwined lives of the book club members than actual plot events. Like an Austen novel, though, all of the characters' love lives work out in the end."
3,"Competent, engaging character portraits","My sister threw me this when I was teaching `Pride and Prejudice' in High School. If there were lots of clever parallels I dare say I missed them: I've only read 'Mansfield Park' in the last few years, and maybe `Emma' a couple of decades ago. Whatever, the novel on its own got me in from the first few pages. It's a nice structure for her to work in - alternative perspectives and ages - and she realises it capably. The characters' histories are probably more interesting than their interplay, but both are engaging. She found a receptive audience in the SF references: any friend of Ursula K. LeGuin is a friend of mine. While she didn't play it for titillation, the references to sexual deviation popped up often enough to justify raising my eyebrows at the preoccupations of the author. Still, they hardly swamped the novel which, while having a useable plot, ran on interesting and plausible character portraits."
3,For Austen Lovers - But Not Really,"A nice quick read. I can't imagine understanding some of it if you didn't know Jane Austen's novels well, but at the same time, that isn't really the plot either."
2,Not impressed...,"I love Jane Austen, so I was interested in this book. I think I was a little let down. The point of view through the whole book was never clear. I found myself trying to figure out who was the narrator, especially in the first chapter. The author had some good ideas, but I feel like she could have fleshed them out a little. If you love Jane Austen, go ahead and read it, but don't expect too much out of it."
3,Slow Start,"I wasn't that impressed with this book. It was given to me as a present. It took me three-fourths of the book to find anything in which to be interested in. I didn't seam to understand what was happening or what the plot was if it had one. Finally in the end when I was just starting to like the characters it ended leaving me questioning.""Why did I read this book""."
2,Don't bother.,"Extremely disappointing. Boring characters with stupid names like Grigg and Allegra (the author even goes so far as to point out that she is named for a Shakespeare character, and not for the allergy medication) meet once a month to discuss their monthly Austen selection. However, there is very little discussion of the chosen books. Fowler sticks random quotes from or about Austen throughout the book in places where they don't make any sense. She ends the book with a chapter summarizing all of the Austen novels, rather than weave this information into the story. It's as if Fowler has collected all of this information on Austen and is determined to use it, even if she can't figure out how to do it in an interesting way. 'Look at me, I can quote Jane Austen.' This book was so boring, I want my money and my time back."
1,Only if You Have Nothing Else to Do,It's a quick read but totally unrewarding. I never became attached to the characters and the discussions on Austen weren't developed either. Pass it up.
2,Mediocre book if you're desparate,"I bought the Jane Austen Book Club at the airport when I was making a connection, so I didn't have too much time to browse. This book couldnt even keep my attention on my very long flight though I had absolutely nothing else to do. The characters are somewhat interesting, but overall I wouldn't recommend buying this book."
3,what a disappointment,"I am a man who really enjoys Jane Austen (P&P; and Persuasion) That, plus the many rave reviews over this book, got me to pick it up when I spotted it on sale.Perhaps its been too long since I've read Austen to get all the references, but this book does nothing for me. The characters are simply uninteresting--there isn't one I'd want to meet, much less be in a book club with. The trials in their various lives, and their individual quirks, wouldn't even make a second rate Lifetime TV movie.I doubt I'll even finish--and I almost never put a book aside once I've started."
1,Disappointed,I have been a fan of Jane Austen since I was 15. I expected this book to discuss Austen's books. It does not. I feel that Jane Austen's name was used to sell this book. A real pity!
3,Entertaining but not great,"I really liked the concept of this book and found it entertaining enough, but I never got really into it. The first person plural narrator really irritated me because I never knew who was telling the story and whose opinion, etc., each chapter was. Would suggest waiting for paperback."
1,Bleah :(,"My dedication to things Jane Austen led my sister to dutifully purchase this for my birthday. As I had previously coveted it in a bookshop, I was most pleased. Sadly, it was a total disappointment. In fact, it is one of the RARE books that I just have not had the will to finish. Given that, I suppose I cannot be counted on as an informed reviewer...but nevertheless...the characters didn't appeal to me and I found it disjointed and, to put it bluntly, boring."
1,Horrible,"Jane Austen was a genius and, even all these years later, most of what Jane touches turns to gold, which explains how this piece of garbage became a bestseller. If Karen (shame on her) Fowler had marketed and sold Jane Austen toilet paper, the result would be almost as offensive to Austen's fans as this ridiculous book. After I finished it, I put it in the recycled bin, since I had no interested in keeping it in my house. I hope it's used to make toilet paper. It would be a fitting end to this pathetic novel."
2,Prejudiced,I often think that with a few notable exceptions English language fiction experienced its heyday in the 19th century and simply died in the mid-20th century. This book proved my prejudice; I couldn't finish it. The two stars are for the interesting list of Austen criticism in the back.
1,I couldn't even finish...,"Being a huge fan of Jane Austen, I was very excited about reading this. However, the farther I got, the more I felt like I had been ""suckered"" into reading it because of the title and supposed JA connection. There were some pretty disgusting things in it(and being a college student, I'm not that easily offended either), and I felt like it was not at all true to the spirit of Austen herself to include them. Besides this, most of the characters were about as lovable as Mr. Collins (Allegra especially just irritated the heck out of me!) If it weren't for the fact that this book was given to me, I would feel cheated out of my hard-earned money as well!"
2,Thank Goodness It's Not Just Me,"I thought I had lost all critical faculties when I compared my reaction to this book with the critical rave reviews. I have been a Janite in my time and see this as another failed attempt to ride on her coatails. That aside, this is a shallow, trite, boring book. It gets two stars for its flashes of wit and sometime felicity of phrase and insight."
2,A disappointing waste of money,"I rushed out to buy this book, thinking it would be as wonderful as the local book reviewer declared it to be. Well. It isn't often that I fail to finish a book out of sheer boredom but this was one of those times. Not even the slyly incisive wit of the writing style could redeem it, or persuade me to keep going, following the stereotypical characters and their cliched backgrounds. I simply didn't care about any of them or feel any stimulation through their stilted engagement with the Austen novels. I put this book on a par with ""A Year of Reading Proust"" by Phyllis Rose - writing without passion or plot hanging off the coat-tails of true greatness. Save your money!"
2,Luke warm,"I read this book, egged on by professional reviews. As I plodded through I kept asking myself, am I enjoying it? Do I like it or not? Maybe I'm not in the mood for this. It did make me laugh out loud, sometimes unintentionally, as when 3/4s of the way through the book Sylvia is revealed to be a fully bilingual Latina. How funny that her ethnicity and history really don't color in any way her insights or her interactions with other characters. As a Mexican-American myself, I am alway educating my beloved British husband in the ways of multiple perspectives. Sylvia's ethnicity seemed a good natured attempt of the author to incorporate the actual history and ethnicity of California, but it seems she has no knowledge of minority perspectives; unless, of course, that is only Allegra's right.Next time I'll stick to books recommended by friends."
2,Disappointing.,"I expected to like this book much better than I did, based on the premise. Both the development of the contemporary characters and the treatment of Jane Austen's works were superficial. And, sometimes, what seems like an original idea for narration turns out to be an impediment to enjoyment. The author gives us a first person plural narrator and I spent so much time trying to figure out who the actual narrator was that it kept me from being able to enjoy the book."
1,Too trashy,"Authors are free to write anything they choose, but not drag Jane Austen into the mud.The premise was intriguing, but the story gets tacky. Don't bother."
1,It doesn't get better!,"This was my book club's choice for this November. Started reading, kept reading hoping it would improve. Never did. It stinks. At Page 156, I decided not to waste anymore time on this drivel. Can't wait til our meeting to find out if other's felt the same."
1,Dreadful.,"I do wish the author had dropped the painfully forced Jane Austen conceit and just expanded on her own characters.The book is poorly edited and proofread (hint: there *is* a difference between ""confirmation"" and ""conformation""), and anyone who knows anything at all about dogs and dog shows will be annoyed beyond belief.Don't bother on this one. Go read Pride and Prejudice again instead."
2,not as good as I was hoping,"I found The Jane Austen Book Club a very light and fast read that was amusing at times, but overall I was disappointed. Very little happens in this book, far less than the happenings of a real Austen novel, and the book club characters don't even discuss Austen's novels that much. Fowler can be witty here and there, but her characters are flat or at least flatly written. We learn ancedotes from their pasts, but it is not clear how these memories have shaped the characters into who they are in the story. Fowler fails to convey any of the real pain or happiness of the characters; she tells us when they are happy or unhappy, but I certainly didn't feel it. She writes about the book club members letting Austen into their lives to look around and influence them, but in this I could see no connection between what the members discuss about the books and then what they did in the story. I was hoping this would be much better."
5,Jane Austen Book Club is more than its surface,"Having previously read all six Jane Austen books and being a devout member of a long-established book club and a long-ago English major, more than one of my friends bought me this book for my birthday! I read it in two days and loved it. To the rest of you who wrote previous reviews--come on, the narrator or (seventh) person is Jane Austen herself looking down from the heavens on the book club. Thank you, Karen Joy Fowler, for coming up with such a wonderful book, remarkable cast of characters, and superb references and homage to Jane Austen and her literary work. It warmed my soul when I needed it!"
1,I've been tricked!,"I thought this would be a light, humorous read centered on Jane Austen but it is instead about a boring gaggle of women (+ one man) and all of their life drama and sexual trauma. I got a little beyond page 50 but I'd rather re-read War and Peace. I was looking forward to some fun reading while sitting by the fire this evening but perhaps I'll just toss this one in. Time is precious, don't waste it on this book!"
2,Not worth the investment ...,"This book is not worth the investment of time or money, unless you have a wealth of both.The author was apparently hoping for success through the strength of her character studies; that is the only logic that can explain the thin plot. The problem is, she doesn't really know these characters. By the end of the book, you've spent so little time with any of them that you don't feel like you know them, nothing of note has happened, and the characters' stories that you have heard have been moderately interesting but not particularly revealing or moving.It's like a garden party where the food was fair but there wasn't much of it and as you're driving home you realize how glad you are to be out of there."
2,In Which I Write A Review,"I don't get why this was supposedly such a fine work of literature. I don't get the sophomoric Jane Austen discussions, I don't get a handle on the characters, I don't get the ""book club discussion questions"" at the end. I didn't find the ""subversive wit and a wise observer of human interaction"" of the author, and the ""the heady literary chat"" was probably way above my own head. I never knew there was such a thing called ""Janeites""-- so maybe this would appeal to people who are obsessed with Austen. I've never been a huge fan.As for the The Washington Post's Book World review, ""It's just as hard to explain quite why The Jane Austen Book Club is so wonderful."" - True. I agree with that! ""But that it is wonderful will soon be widely recognized, indeed, a truth universally acknowledged."" Wow- isn't that some neat prophesying!"
1,"Poor, poor Jane","A book dedicated to the wit, charm, sophistication and style of Austen's novels, this one fails to win hearts or minds using any of the above criteria. The characters are unlikeable (except maybe for the dogs), and the book is thin and insubstantially written, with no detectable ""voice"" or style. The nice irony of this book is that it will probably be read by a great many book clubs, although the sheer banality of the story is enough to put one off book clubs forever.Read Austen instead. And when you're done, read some of the feminist Austen scholars quoted in the back of this book, to get a sense of what a real engagement with Austen's work might look like."
4,"Entertaining Novel Recaps Austen, Life","While I expected a little more detail about the Austen novels, since I never read all of them, this book definitely made me want to pick up the Austen anthology on my shelf and read. I enjoyed the stories of the characters mixed in with Austen's novels. Affairs, crushes, marriages - this book has all the appeal of life. All in all, this is a book to enjoy whether you read Austen or not."
2,Should I have read more Jane Austen?,"I'm not an Austen reader but I picked this up because the author was from my home town. It was a little predictable and perhaps I was lost on the connections to the Austen novels. My book club gave it hoe-hum reviews as well, but none of us are Austen readers. I do like the incorporation of the man into the bookclub and the snide remarks about his contributions to the potluck dinners. So much like a book club to judge that."
1,Meaningless - Poor Jane !!!,"I LOVE, simply LOVE Jane Austen... Unfortunalety, I decided to read this book because of her. I guess that the author thought the same: people will buy this because of Austen's name...Poor thing, dead for almost 200 years and people milking her name for idiotic reasons...I gave up on page 168. It was going nowhere. The story is completely lukewarm, there is no conflict, the characters don't inspire any sort of feeling, nothing makes your continue reading it.I think this was the most shameless attempt to get money from a beloved author that is no longer alive to defend herself.Skip this one... go read or reread Jane's books instead!"
2,"See the movie, forget the book.","Book clubs, meet-ups, etc are quite prevalent these days. The title alone seems interesting. But alas the book does not deliver. Only a small portion of the book is spent on book club meetings, where the conversation is scattershot and shallow, although perhaps little more could be expected with the myriad of similar characters produced by Austen in her works. Much of the book is devoted to rather lackluster, meandering mini-biographies of the club members.It is only the sub-plots of Sylvia's separation from Daniel and dog-breeder Jocelyn's interest in the only male of the group Griggs that give the book any real interest or continuity. The book doesn't run out of steam because it never gets off the ground - there's no focus to speak of.In this case, the recent movie of the same name is far more interesting and better done. While retaining a good bit of the plot, what little there is, the character interactions are far more engaging. See the movie, forget the book."
3,What's all the hype?,"I must admit, I read it through and found the book club members curious and Californian to the core, if that is a fair stereotyping by me. But I guess I was expecting more to HAPPEN. This is a plotless book, or very nearly so, with Jane Austen's work as the hook. I wonder.Being in a book club of five women and one man, not a Grigg at all, I thought I might discover some parallels in our discussions with those of the JABC fictional group. I guess that their wandering off the subject fits ours. And I suppose we could be accused of the same social loyalities.Clearly this novel is not really about Austen, although Fowler includes plenty of Austen info in the epilogue-like would-be scholarly final pages, and I can't quite decide why it is so HOT! Maybe I need to discuss it with my own book club and find some feedback."
2,Boring,"What can I say? I wanted to like this book, but I just didn't. I have a rule that if I get to page 100 of a book and don't care about the characters or what happens next, I give up. Likewise with audio books: If, after listening for two hours, I am bored and unengaged I give up. I listen to many audio books and very rarely do I give up on any, but after 2 hours of this book I felt that life is too short to endure any more of this.. The narrators voice was dull and the story just didn't keep me interested."
3,Almost... but not quite!,"I thought this novel was a delightful read with all its references to Jane Austen. However, where the novel falls short is in the area of plot and character development. The best attempt at development came in the form af the daughter and her ever-questioning ways and her obvious strength. However the other characters are weak and poorly written. Sadly enough, even the daughter eventually disappoints the reader. Nothing like Austen but an ok read for a day at the beach!"
2,"Idea-10, Execution-1","Creative idea around which to construct a book - 10, Execution of said neat idea - 1, Number of pages I lasted before bailing - 83.Maybe I'm too harsh since I've not read much Jane Austen, but this book really is thin. The characters are sterotypical and the plot just doesn't go anywhere. Where's Moe with the cream pie when you need him ?"
1,Poor Jane Austen,"I bought it at the airport and even captive in a six-hour flight, this novel book failed to keep my attention. The characters are boring, the writing is mediocre, the plot is uninspired, and the narrator keeps changing without any logic. Anybody who admires Jane Austen's brilliance and wit will be sorely disappointed by this awful book. As for Jane Austen herself, I can imagine her rolling in her grave at being mentioned in the same sentence with Karen Dull Fowler."
2,Disappointing in many ways,"First let me confess that I've not made an effort to become a fan of Austen. That, alone, might put into context a reader's reaction to my less than thrilled review of this book.I stumbled in the first chapter when the first person narrator introduced all six book club members in the third person, not accounting for herself. I presumed it was some kind of literary game, but found it annoying. I don't think it was resolved.While I did finish the book, I was grumbling. It seemed light, slight, entertaining in parts, contained some wonderful lines and observations, but ultimately did not satisfy in any genre. How did all those wonderful writers get coopted into the 'blurb community'?"
1,Waste of time,"The only good part of this book are the quotations about Jane Austen in the back. That said, this book has no interesting dialog, there are few comments about Austen's books and they are random and are usually a vehicle to comment on the character making the statement. Also the action jumps all over the place affecting the flow of the narrative. Add to that the fact that you probably won't care in the slightest about these lackluster, poorly defined people. Very sorry I bought the book and wasted time reading 70 pages."
2,Kind of blah,"I expected more from this book. It was sort of interesting sometimes, but not overall. I think the movie would be better, but I haven't seen it, so I don't know. The narrative style makes it seem like a screenplay with all the flashbacks.I'd buy the book used or borrow it. It's not worth retail."
2,Boring and could not get into this,"I could not really get into this book. It jumped from character to character, and it was a little interesting learning about the lives of some of the book club, but then the story jumped to another person, or jumped so far into the future that I felt left out of their lives again. Half of the book the characters spent discussing their thoughts on Jane Austen's novels, and if you are not familiar with or interested in her novels I am sure that part would be very boring for you."
3,A rarity...the movie might be better,"This is the one exception that I can think of where the movie might be better than the book. I enjoyed the book but I felt it might have tried to tackle too many diverse characters in too many diverse situations. I think maybe it just plays better on screen. At first I thought the book differed a lot from the movie but as I started to compare them, it is actually a good interpretation, it just plays richer. I am a big fan of Austen and have read all the books and this might have also created more of a disappointment where the books do play a role I don't think they are as well used as they could have been."
4,Enjoyable,"I had seen the movie first, which actiully was a little more fun for me than the book. Maybe I was already too full of plot expectations that weren't quite fulfilled in the same way. I did enjoy the book very much, however, and have added it to my growing collection of JA peripherals."
1,Jane Austen would be horrified.,"As an avid Jane Austen fan, I was pleased when I found this book. I've enjoyed several other Austen spin off books, and looked forward to reading it. When I hit page 19, and I put the book aside to be recycled. Page 19 gives details about a college student sexual molesting a tween with his fingers. This is inappropriate in every sense, and from what I know of Jane Austen, she would horrified to have her name associated with this filth."
3,You should probably be a Jane Austen fan to read this,"I have to admit that I've tried to read Jane Austen, but haven't been successful. Try as I might, I can't connect with her style of writing. I thought if I read this book, I might gain a deeper appreciation of Jane Austen and feel inspired to try her once again, but this wasn't the case. I did enjoy this book, although there wasn't anything outstanding about it. Perhaps if I were a huge Jane Austen fan, I'd have enjoyed it more."
3,occasionally witty,"At first this seemed like a formulaic ""chick lit"" book with unmemorable characters. Even though I still think the characters were not all that memorable, the book did get better as I read on. Fowler has a wit that occasionally comes out; I didn't have any huge belly laughs but every so often there was a modest, five-second laugh."
3,I'm half and half on this one...,"While this was certainly a good book, I suppose I was most disappointed that it focused mainly on the development of the main characters and less on Jane Austen in general. Basically, they meet to talk about her and her works, and other than that, she doesn't have much at all to do with the plot. I was just looking for a bit more...possibly because the works of Jane Austen have touched my life so profoundly, and despite [most of] the characters' love of Austen, they did not seem to have that same connection with her works."
3,Best for Jane Austen Fans,"Just the other day I was lamenting over the fact that my favorite authors had to up and die on me and therefore couldn't produce anymore books. But then I discovered two books this year that continue the legacy of their forebearers (the other is Emma Brown by Clare Boylan). For Jane Austen fans, here's a way to enjoy the memories of Jane wrapped up in a modern-day imitation. Just as the title says, the book centers around the lives (and manners) of a book club which brings the main characters together on a regular basis. Not as good as the real thing, and one has to be a Jane Austen fan to really enjoy, but it's a good read that's quite fun at times."
3,Different,"I wasn't expecting a book about Jane Austen, so I wasn't disappointed in that regard. I thought the vehicle of Austen to get to know the book club characters and advance the story was very clever. (The flashback thing was a bit confusing and distracting, though.) This really was more of a book about the members of the book club and their relationships. If Oprah's book club was still doing current fiction, I could definitely see this book as a monthly selection."
1,Nothing Happens,I have to say that our book club picked this book and just found that nothing happened in it. There was no character development and the book left you wondering what the whole point of it was. We were unsure why the author chose to include-at the back of the book-comments made by other people on Jane Austen. It seemed irrelevant to us. The book was very boring and it took us weeks to finish because we just had no incentive to pick it up.
4,"More Than Just Talking ""Jane Austen""","This story is about a book club that gets together, like most book clubs, around good food and good conversation, to discuss their lives and the books they're reading. The only difference is, this club is dedicated to the novels of Jane Austen. I really enjoyed how we get to really know the club members well and about their lives in this funny, fun, touching book. I liked it, and your sister or mother will love it even more.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
4,"Good book, but a little something missing","All but one of the characters was well-developed. The remaining character is somewhat mysterious, so not knowing much about her was just fine. My only critique is that the author sets the novel in Sacramento and the surrounding areas, but doesn't explicitly say where. As a local reader, I would have loved to know if the characters were hankering down in Woodland, Vacaville, or Davis."
5,No Homework Required,"Even though I have never read any of Jane Austen's books, and have seen only one of the movie adaptations [""Clueless""], I enjoyed this book enormously."
2,Hardly worth it,"After reading the reviews of this book, I couldn't wait to read it. I wish I had waited, a long time. The book seemed contrived. An easy to follow plot line without surprises along the way. A much better book based on the same premise - a ladies' book club - is And The Ladies Of The Club."
1,Disappointing,My hopes were high as I opened this book. They quickly plummeted. The idea behind the book is genius; it's unfortunate that the author didn't fully develop its potential. I found the plot weak and the characters insipid. I enjoy Jane Austen's work. Read her novels firsthand and skip this snoring regurgitation.
2,Name Dropping and nothing more,A tiny bit has to do with Jane Austen and her very insightful novels about people and their personalities. This is a lot of tripe mixed in with a bit about knowing what Jane Austen's books are about. Ho hum... Really a bore.
2,I was ok,Beleive it or not this time I prefer the movie compare to the book. Did not really get into it. The characters didnot interest me as much as the movie were able to do. Get the movie it will entertain you for 2 hrs better than the book
2,Boring!,"I plodded my way through this book because I hate to give up and I had nothing else around to read. I found the characters boring and their discussions of the books completely uninspired. Also, the author has the annoying habit of telling you too much instead of letting you figure it out for yourself. The only reason I would recommend this book to anyone was for the interesting information at the end--after the novel is finished the author provides information about what other people have thought of Jane Austen as well as a short synopsis of each of her books."
2,Don't waste your time,If you want to read Austen buy Pride and Prejudice not this book. TJABC is long on slapstick and short on things Austen. It pales in comparison to Austen's razor wit.
2,Left me disengaged,"Although I love Jane Austen and have read all of her novels at least once, I did not love this book. I actually barely liked it. For me the high points were moments of discussion of the novels (although there really wasn't that much brought up that an avid reader wouldn't have thought of or discussed already)and parts of the characters' back stories. At moments when Fowler brings their pasts to life she gives her characters true dimension and is able to make the reader chuckle or wince. However, like some other reviewers my biggest problem with the novel is that I just didn't care about the characters in their present. It didn't matter if they ended up happy or sad. I didn't feel their joys or pain- they were just flat. I kept reading for hope of a pleasing ending, but it just seemed too wrapped up for me and as a whole was not too memorable at all."
2,I don't see the connection to Jane Austen,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, but after the first few chapters, I realized that it was not what I was expecting. The book was very slow & choppy. I also felt that the author was ""stretching"" the connection with Jane Austen, when there was very little correlation. I had to skip a few pages towards the end just to keep myself from falling asleep.I would not recommend this book."
4,Good book,"A good book though not a great one. Although there was much talk of Austen, I could have done with more of it. And I'm sure that the characters' stories in many ways were parallel to Austen's novels, but I just didn't have the time to really think about it enough to really make those connections."
3,Nothing moves in a straight line,"What an understatement. The audio version was difficult to follow. The story line is disjointed. I am a fan of Jane Austen, but I did not enjoy this book."
1,Don't buy it!,"I wanted to give it zero stars, but the program wouldn't let me. The author used the paltry ploy of borrowing Austen's name to sell a few books. My husband fell for it an bought it for me. I could barely get through the first few chapters. No Jane heroine would behave in such a passive manner as the people in this book. Not a redeeming quality among the characters, and after several chapters it seemed the plot was non-existent. You should also be warned that the book contains some disturbing tales of physical abuse."
2,not good,"I didn't enjoy this book. Flat characters, boring ""action"" (talking about reading is not action in my opinion), and the ""shocking"" secrets in the characters' personal histories are also boring. I recommend the book ""The Crimson Petal and the White"" to all avid readers....much more fun and NOT boring."
2,Big Letdown!,"I love Jane Austen and was excited to read this book. The first 50 or so pages were pretty good. I liked the characters and the premise but halfway through, the stories meandered. It was a bunch of flashbacks and recollections. Would authors today just please write a story told in linear fashion!!! Flashbacks and recollections really do not advance the plot and the plot is a problem here as other readers have mentioned. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because of the reviews about Jane Austen herself in the back. And to the writer on the book jacket who said this story was similar to one that Austen might write ---PUH LEEZE!"
2,Boring,"I made it through 2 1/2 discs before the unnecessary cussing made me throw in the towel. I skipped to the end and listened to the 7th disc. And I hadn't missed anything--there was no plot. It's mostly just a bunch of people thinking about sex. Who cares? The book has weak structure, with the book club and an out-of-place first-person narrator apparent attempts to tie the characters together. How could this possibly be compared to Jane Austen?"
1,chick-lit lite,"What a disappointment... chick-lit wrapped in literary pretense.Thin characters, thin dialogue, thin book --- more than a novella, not quite a novel.Only 250 of the short pages are story. The additional pages have quotes about Jane Austen and synopses of her novels.I'm going back to Jane Austen and Barbara Pym...."
2,A Cheat,"Complete misuse of Jane Austen's name! Unlike Austen's books, this is no page turner! The book is really a cheat in the end, the Jane Austen hook a marketing ploy of sorts that never lives up to the quality of promise. Story and characters are slim, developments built around Jane Austen books and themes serve as a literary device, but it just wasn't that well executed in terms of adding much more in terms of deeper insights into characters, even complimenting the realities of their lives, much less into the fictional world of Jane Austen itself, which served a fascinating possibility based on the book's title. And as an Austen fan, I fell for that as a buyer. As a reader, none of it panned out thematically. I can't understand how this book earned any glowing reviews. It is a trifle, at best and not remarkable at all in terms of the author's writing style, plot, intelligence or wit."
1,"Geez, a molestation scene in Chapter 1......",Many of us who love and read Austen are going to be repulsed/offended by the themes of this book. The first chapter describes in detail a molestation scene of a 15 year old girl by a young man. Not exactly something that I want to read/think about (graphically) in a book. This one goes back to the bookstore. Too much vulgarity for me. Don't pick this up; it's trash.
1,What did I miss??,"This was hardly the page turner I expected from the reviews of this book..(Obviously friends and family of the author) A fan of Jane Austen, this book doesn't begin to even compare...Slim characters and a slimmer story line...with references to the great works written by Austen. Don't be fooled by the title (as I was) This book is on sale for a reason. Save your time.I want my money back.."
1,I threw it out,"Because of its offensive sexual material, I threw this book out after reading one chapter. I teach English literature and found the book a waste of time and money."
2,Great concept...and not much else,"I admit I generally like a little plot with my books. It took me two attempts to make it through this one, because the characters don't interact that much; each meeting of the book club is accompanied by a few more flashbacks. The characters I found a little thin, and some were unconvincing. (We're told repeatedly that Allegra is more emotionally volatile than the others, but she doesn't actually act that way, and she speaks in the same dry understated way that some of the others do.) By the time I finally limped toward the end, convinced by the glowing reviews that there had to be something more here, I felt I'd been had. It's a shame that such a great idea was wasted on such a weak story."
1,Skip this one!!!,"The Jane Austen Book Club is a complete wash if you like to read real Jane Austen books. It is dull, the characters are irritating and the plot (is there one?) goes nowhere. There is no motivation to get from beginning to end. Spend your time on other books."
1,Misuse and abuse of Miss Austen's wonderful novels,"This is a trite book with barely a plot and minimal character development. As a Jane Austen fan, I am horrified that this awful book was able to misuse Jane Austen's name in order to sell books.The concept was brilliant, but the execution was very poor. Count me amongst the highly disappointed."
2,Look elsewhere for good literary fiction...,"I picked this book up because I've really enjoyed some of the literary fiction I've read lately (such as The Secret Life of Bees and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time), and was looking for something else in the same vein.Book Club? Austen? Non-glossy cover? I was in.Yeah, but no. The novel is mostly disjointed, jumping from one ill-drawn character sketch to another. And the thing that bugs me most is -- who the heck is narrating? It's told from a first-person point of view, but you have no idea who the narrator is. Other authors can pull that off (such as Toni Morrison, in Jazz), but it doesn't work for Fowler. If you want good character development, read Margaret Atwood.If you want Austen -- well, read Austen."
2,Interesting concept falls short of my expectations,"This story of a group of adults that meet over a summer to discuss the works of Jane Austen had a lot of promise, I thought.Every month they meet at someone's home to discuss one of Austen's novels. And each chapter delves a little into the life of one of the club's members. These characters, on the face of it, are an interesting and varied group: the lesbian, the divorcee, the quiet man, among others. Although the author does tell us about them, I never really felt ""attached"" to these people. There seemed to be an emotional dimension that was missing between these Austen fans and myself. And the ending is a little too tidy for my taste.But don't get me wrong. I still enjoyed reading this novel. I read all of the works written by Jane Austen a few years ago, and it was nice to be reminded of how great those novels actually are through this book club.Overall, a nice book, a good concept, but no emotional ties developed with these characters."
4,A delightful read,"I'm a little surprised by the low reviews this book has received...I am listening to the audio version and am enchanted by the style of the author and the way she weaves the different stories through the lives of her characters. I suppose if you've watched the movie first you probably have different expectation and could be disappointed. But I personally find her clever, candid and tongue-in-cheek humor to be refreshing and delightful! I do plan to watch the movie also; it's on my Netflix queue, but it's always a gamble as to which could possibly ""ruin"" the other for me...the narrator's tones and expressions certainly do help in bringing it to life. I like it, and barring a totally contrived and awful ending, I suspect I'll feel the same way at the end of the book as I do now, in the middle."
1,The film is better,"I enjoyed the film based upon the book, so decided to buy the book. So often, a great deal has to be left out of the film and of course, details are changed, so I was looking forward to reading the book.I set this book aside after only a few chapters. I found it vulgar and ""angry"" whereas the film was not. It will be donated at the next charity pick-up...not worthy of a place on my bookshelves."
2,Good Start - Lost Opportunity,"It's a classic quick summer read. Good beginning with a start on developing each member of the book club; but then it simply doesn't go anywhere. The last chapter is thrown at you like the author was told to wrap it up quick and be done with it! However, if you're on the library list waiting for the book you really want to read, and you need a short diversion... this is the book for you."
2,Great premise but.....,"I was really looking forward to this read, being a fan of Austen as well as book clubs. While I thought the writing was strong enough and tinged with a good sense of humor, I found it mildly boring and fairly plotless. Couldn't come to really care about those characters. Just kept going to find out about Jocelyn and Grigg (I am a traditional romantic at heart) and to find out who was the narrator??? Unless I missed something, the narrator was never identified?? Frustrating."
2,well....,I can say i liked the characters in this book. The part i could have done without was the whole Jane Austen theme. Would have been a good book otherwise.
1,The Jane Austen Book Club,I would actually give this a minus 1 star if that was a choice. This book has too many vulgar words which only detract from the story.It's not a book I could finish nor recommend.
4,A recommendation,"My sister-in-law recently recommended two books and I found both to be superb novels. The first was a book by the title ""The Bark of the Dogwood"" (funny, horrifying, and well-written). The second was this one: THE JANE AUSTEN BOOK CLUB. While I'm one for an unusal premise, I wasn't too optimistic that this would be a great read. After all, I'm not particularly an Austen fan. But the book is not so much about Austen as it is a rather interesting collection of people in a book club. What Fowler does with her premise is fascinating and I'll be reading more books by her. This book deserves its own book club."
1,The Jane Austin Book Club,"I, like some other Amazon reviewers, was drawn to this book by professional reviewers but was extremely disappointed. The characters were trite and rather than a job, reading it became an odious assignment that in the end, I could even make myself complete. Don't waste your money."
1,What does this have to do with Jane?,"There are so many books out right now related to Jane Austen and the books she wrote so I guess this author was trying to capitalize -- or cash in -- on this trend. I seriously wish that someone would make this writer take the name ""Jane Austen"" out of the title. It just isn't good enough to deserve to use her name. I tried to read this book when it first came out a few years ago and couldn't get past the first few chapters. I recently picked it up to try again and had the same reaction. This time I did make myself read the whole thing just to be fair to the author in case I should discover some redeeming value in later chapters. I never found much to like. Firstly, it has very little to do with Jane Austen's books and secondly, it's not all that great a story. Everyone else I know who's read it has had a pretty similar reaction so I'm not alone. Don't bother! Skip the book and go directly to the DVD (not something I usually recommend). The movie is much better."
2,In need of plot and character development,"It's interesting that many reviewers disappointed in this book are Austen fans hoping to ""hear about Austen, and Austen's brilliant characters"". The marketing for this book doesn't really give such lofty expectations, does it? Nevertheless, on its own, the book is only mildly interesting, the characters and conversations are strange and flighty, and there doesn't seem to be any real plot. I didn't find myself in the least involved or interested in these barely-developed characters.As for the author depicting the book club members to mimic Jane Austen characters, this idea is a serious stretch. I don't see the resemblance and wouldn't even have recognized such had I not read the reviews! Overall this book seems to be scattered, certainly an easy read, but the plot and character development are pretty well non-existent."
2,and the point is... what?,"Whatever it is, it's not found in this book.I'm a Jane Austen fan, so I gravitated towards this book like George W. Bush to a Baptist convention. My excitement immediately stalled, though, within twenty pages. The characters sit around and talk or go to meaningless sci-fi seminars where they bash Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The characters neither grow nor change, they remain stagnant throughout the book and the prologue to the book seems a thrown-together synopsis the author created because she didn't want to answer the question ""Whatever happened to...?""I usually never say this, but, SKIP THIS BOOK."
1,Huge disappointment.,"I made the mistake of buying this novel on a whim at a local bookshop. Usually I read several reviews before investing in an author I haven't read before, but in this case I was drawn in by the Jane Austen references and by the many, many positive jacket blurbs from well-known writers.Karen Joy Fowler must be a really nice person and/or a huge producer of blurbs that had to be repaid. I can't imagine any other reason why excellent writers would risk their reputations in recommending such a mediocre work.Fowler is far from being a modern Jane Austen. Her characters are poorly developed. The plotting is poor. Overall this is just not an interesting or appealing book.If you love Jane Austen as I do, you may find yourself appalled that her name is associated with this dreck."
3,Not Austen's Caliber,A group of women and one man meet to discuss each of the Jane Austen books. Fowler attempts to draw parallels between the group members and the plots of the Austen books. I listened to this book. I think I should have read it and intend to in the future.
4,Not bad!,"I watched the movie before I even knew there was a book. Unfortunantly I fell in love with the characters in the movie... which kinda stunk because they are portrayed at least 10 years younger in the movie. Sylvia's daughter Allegra, who is a teen in the movie, is 30 in the book. And the other women are all in their 40's except Bernadette, she's about right... So I kinda had to push my imagination into double time and try to forget the actors. I enjoy the book's wonderful vivid details and I laughed out loud at least every few pages, which was great. Very witty and sarcastic and just completely enjoyable as far as I'm concerned. Of course, I love Jane Austen so the idea of these women and 1 man doing a book club of all Jane Austen all the time was fabulous to me! I envy them and their fun times! At least we get to follow along and wish we were there with them."
3,"Unexceptional, but enjoyable.","This is an unexceptional, but enjoyable novel. Fowler creates one terrific book club, warts and all, and the plot moves along sprightly. The problem is that the novel reads like Fowler had sketched out all there was to know about the characters before starting her writing."
1,Overrated -- I did not get past page 25,"Sorry - I tend to make snap judgments about books, and I can usually tell within about 30 pages whether a book is worth my time or not. I found the writing style choppy, jumping back and forth between past and present time, and just knew that this book was not my cup of tea. So I stopped there and returned it to the library. The past events in the characters' lives, which the author felt so compelled to mention, seemed completely insignificant to me -- instead of shedding some light on the characters, which I imagine was the point of the digressions."
4,Endearing... Sneaks Up on You,"Karen Joy Fowler's The Jane Austen Book Club is a quietly endearing read. It is slyly humorous and must be fully read and pondered for complete enjoyment. This novel is a subtle pleasure-- not fully appreciated until savored and digested.Fowler's plot is superficially quiet: a six-person book club-- five women and a lone male-- gathers to read the six novels of Jane Austen. Little happens on the surface, but the characters' lives change significantly during the progress of the novel and the reader grows to know and appreciate each member of the club. In reflecting back on the novel, one is struck by how much Fowler packed into this read, and how effortless she's made her achievement appear.All told, The Jane Austen Book Club is a worthy homage to Austen herself. Don't skip the summaries of Austen's novels, diverse critical reactions to Austen, and the hilarious questions for readers (done in the voices of the novel's principal characters) at book's end."
2,The title is all I liked about this book.,"About halfway into the novel I realized the book is probably only as popular as it is because of the title. After all, us Jane Austen fans only have a handful of her books to read and re-read, so we have to get more of her in some other way... but this book by Fowler certainly is not the answer. There are some clever parallels between Austen's themes and the characters in this book, but not enough to make it interesting. In fact, I never came to like ANY of the six characters in this book, and the sparse references to Austen didn't make this book worth the while."
1,"Hands down, the worst book I've ever read","I'm not into book bashing - every book has its redeeming points - but this was just a horrible waste of time and money. My book club was in complete agreement as well. Thin, predictable characters; no plot; focus on random aspects of Austen's books; sloppy ending that glossed over details in order to wrap things up; and no discernable parallel to Austen's work. One ambitious member of my book club even pulled out old copies of Austen's novels in an attempt to find the links between Fowler's work and Austen. She found nothing. I kind of feel bad writing this review, but the book was so horrible it made me mad at everyone involved with bringing it to life. Don't waste your time - and don't fall for the ""book club"" marketing gimmick like we did."
3,neither perfect nor painful,"I brought this book along with me on a 2-week military training exercise and despite HOURS and HOURS of free time I found myself slowly-but steadily making my way through these pages. Emphasis on slowly. I was really looking forward to reading it because I loved 'Reading Lolita In Tehran' which was a book-clubby reflection on some of my favorite novels with a captivating backdrop of womens'life in Iran during the revolution...sadly, this one didn't even come close. I didn't find the characters to be all that interesting and the book club discussions lacked the pithy aphorisms that I found in 'Reading Lolita..'--But then again, I did keep on turning the pages until I reached the end and I'm not sorry that I read it...only a little disappointed that I didn't enjoy it. Not something I would recommend."
1,Where's Jane?,"Among the many things missing from this novel, the most important is any trace of Jane Austen. The author ""helpfully"" gives unhelpful one-paragraph plot summaries of the six Austen novels at the back of the book. Reduced to squibs, they read like one act TV soaps. I found this device discouraging and off-putting.The members of the ""club"" itself come weighed down with lengthy back stories. They include a dog breeder, a divorcée and her lesbian daughter, an older single woman, and a young man of unknown gender preference who demonstrates an incredible lack of knowledge of or feeling for, the novels.The actual discussions center more around the psychological makeup and motives of Austen's characters than her writing itself or any of her literary accomplishments. Heaven forbid I should ever join a club like that one!"
2,Nothing like Jane Austen,"Although I had trouble putting this book down until I finished it, I failed to find much meaning behind the events in characters' lives. There didn't seem to be much of a plot. The whole novel was pointless. I couldn't draw any connections between it and Jane Austen's novels, except for a vague one between P&P and Jocelyn and Grigg's romance (and that's by a long stretch). None of the characters were endearing. It didn't even come close to Austen. Sorry, this book sucks..."
2,Not what I expected,"Being a Jane Austen fan and having read some reviews in literary magazines, I thought I was really going to enjoy this novel. However, the characters and their plots are very weak and you are always expecting the stories to improve, but ...Sylvia, Jocelyn, Allegra are certainly not Austen characters."
3,READ BEFORE BUYING -- It's OKAY but other books were better,"I think some of the content here is relevant, but there's a lot that isn't. The Dummies book would be better, or read up on investing with Investing Without Losing (ISBN 0978834607 NOT on amazn, other stores)"
2,Idiot Real Estate,This book would be great if I was trying to decide if I wanted to be a Real Estate Agent.
2,Some good some bad some ugly,"There is some great advice for the novice agent in this book. But I think the author/agent speaks from two sides of her mouth. She promotes good ethics and attention to detail in terms of contracts and client-care. BUT, her own business is based on facilitating For Sale By Owners and an a la carte approach to representation. Both of these approaches to Agency undercut our business and our income. We spend a lot of money in this business, and are at great risk of frivilous lawsuits, burn out, and even our personal safety. Undercutting the traditional 6% (or even 5%) commission by offering limited services for a reduced rate undermines our whole industry. Any author/agent who supports cut rate real estate services should be read with skepticism."
1,Rubbish. . .pure rubbish,"I'll make this short and sweet. . .if you've been in the real estate biz for any amount of time go ahead and read this book purely for the laughs you'll get. I must agree with another reviewer about Ms. Sullivan's ""utopian view."" It's quite obvious upon reading this piece of rubbish that she never sold real estate full time.If you are new to the business please RUN from this book. Again, it bears very little resemblance to the daily life of a truly successful real estate sales person. Even her terminology is messed up. There are PLENTY of truly knowledgeable real estate gurus with wonderful, informative books. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,I feel like an idiot for buying it,I have recently become licesed and atained both a sales person and a brokers license. I thought the advice on how to pass the state exam was rubbish... here is the best advice ...study till you know the material and then take the test.The rest of the book was amaturish at best and I will just donate it to our local vets on the next charity drive
2,Try another book,"As many of the other reviewers have noted. The author is more focused on being a discount agent in her private practice. She is also is very focus on the technical aspects of real estate and real estate law. It is like taking the real estate exam all over again. I was not looking for hours of useless information like in liscensing school. I was hoping she was going to share really solid techniques to make more money but alas they where limited.I would recommend Success as a Real Estate Agent for Dummies by Dirk Zeller. It is well constructed and packed with how to's and systems to increase your income. His insights into prospecting, lead follow up, time management and sales presentations is outstanding. A truly must read for any agent. Save you money on this book and invest it into the ""original"" guide the Dummies book."
3,Book/CD-ROM,"The book version is very good. The CD-ROM version could be improved. There are drugs like flovent that I can find in the book, but haven't be able to find on the CD-ROM. New drugs like Celebrex aren't in the book or the CD-ROM. They are on their website, but I don't know if the information can be downloaded."
1,Nursing 2000 Drug Handbook - CDROM,"I am positive that I would have nothing negative to say about the actual handbook itself, but the CD-ROM is absolutely worthless. I've now had about 10 days to use this item & the software has major problems with it. I've called Amazon's 800 number to voice my dissatisfaction with this product & I will let the publisher's know as well. Each time I use the CD-ROM the program either automatically resets itself or the computer freezes & I have to reset it. If it did not have these major problems I would still have some recommendations to improve the system & would have highly recommended it to others."
4,"A good anime to watch, if you have the patient","Gasaraki is a good anime to watch, if you have the patient to sit though the entire series. It is slow paced due to the complex deep plot and political intrigue. Some viewers are bored to tears because of it.The legitimate Perfection Collection can be had for around $30 if you shop around, mostly due to the market saturation and insufficient demand of it."
2,This series lied to me.,"I was promised mech-combat. I had proper combat for the first couple of episodes, and then towards the last couple of episodes. That's less episodes than DVDs. Meh series, that cost a lot."
2,Another of the slew of late 90s Evangelion rip-offs.,"Evangelion was a very good anime, but unfortunately it spawned a number of similar, lower quality rip-offs, and Gasaraki is one of them. Evangelion combined big robots fighting with religion and psychology to dazzle many viewers worldwide. Gasaraki combined religion, a dash of mysticism, and snooze-inducing politics of apparently fictional countries to lull the few people who sought it out gently to sleep.The main female character even looks like a Rei Ayanami knock-off.I really do like the end theme though."
2,boring and stupid,"This is possibly the worst thing I ever saw. It's boring and so much stuff happens too quickly. It's storyline is pretty stupid as well. Most of the characters are useless and only three of them have of sort of personality.My Rating: 2/10This show Rating 12 and up: Violence, tobacco use, brief nudity, occasional profanity, grotesque imagery"
4,an underrated axeman shines with varied textures,the version of 'your lost little girl' is worth the price of buying this album alone--it's fantastic. especially with the incredible bruce gary (of The Knack fame) accompanying on drums. A well-rounded effort with various textures and decent production values.
5,Best Watercolour Book,I first read this as a library book and just had to have it. It is the best book I have read on still life watercolour. An added bonus is the chapter on mixed media. She shares her working methods and inspiration. It has been very valuable to my growth as an artist. Beginners may find it challenging but it is worth having in your learning library.
5,NHL DVD Review,This is a great DVD at an excellent price. I enjoyed watching the great moments in NHL Stanley Cup history.
2,Which Game #7 are included??,It seems harder and harder to get the pertinant info on these multi-disc sets. Does anyone have any info on what Game #7's are in this set??
1,Hated It!!!,"Do not buy this DVD if you have any good memories of NYC Nightlife. I was so psyched for this DVD, expecting video clips of nights at Limelight, hearing some of the music, and mentioning some of the DJs. Instead I got 2 hours of negative news footage scapegoating Peter Gatien as the cause of all drug probems in NYC in the 90's and interviews with members of law enforcement. I ejected the DVD 50 minutes into it and threw it in the garbage. What a joke!"
3,Rudy Giuliani killed NYC's nightlife,"Thanks, Rudy. I'd love to still be able to go to Limelight (now a shopping mall, in a church), but all I've got left is the Lion King. Nice legacy."
2,could have been better,boreing dont waste your moneyi was expecing much moreit was disappointingwhat more can i sayit sould have been on tv
3,Perhaps it's MY timing...but...,"I've fallen asleep both times I've tried to watch this! I've found myself glued to anything related to NYC nightlife, especially during the time in which Peter Gatien was standing tall. So far, though, this DVD hasn't captured my mind and attention.Once I'm more clear-minded, perhaps I'll be able to supply a better ""review""."
3,interesting movie not as good as the trailer...,"Interesting look at the new york club life, unfortunately, it's low budget and not that interesting, if you already have knowledge of that time."
5,The End of a Story,"Heaven and Hell, the last book in the North and South trilogy was absolutely wonderful. This book is mainly about Charles and his life in the West. And also his trying to find a place in the world after the war. Madeline is also a major character in this book with her journal entries to Orry. And the evil Bent has to make his appearance throughout. (I could have done without Bent!!) The lives of Stanley, Virgilia, Billie, Brett, and the love-to-hate-her Aston aren't covered as much in this book. I would have loved to learn more about Billie and Brett. Also would have liked to read more about Marie-Louise and her Yankee husband Theo. I found the parts of the book about them to be very touching.If you've already read the other two books you must read this one to find out what happens. You will be in for quite a few surprises. This book is definitely worth reading. A classic!!!"
3,Not as good as the first two,"Heaven and Hell was an interesting read at times, but it was not nearly as engaging as the first two novels. I think there was not enough balance with the time spent on certain characters. The book mainly focuses on Charles and Madeline with small interludes focusing on other characters. George is basically nonexistent through the novel. Several hundred pages separate sequences with Ashton, who I think is one of the most fun characters throughout the trilogy. Jakes definitely demonstrated more balance in North and South. A strength of the novel is how the reader is made to feel some of the frustrations of time period, disgust at gruesome battle scenes or the injustice and hatred which was so pervasive at that time in our history."
3,Why is this book out of print??,"While ""Heaven and Hell"" is the weakest of the ""North and South"" trilogy, it is still a worthwhile read. The story focuses on Charles primarily. Unfortunately, Brett and Billy are almost written out and Cooper becomes a hateful, bitter man. Parts of the book are frustrating (such as Charles' obsession with exacting revenge on the Indians), but for the most part, I enjoyed this book and found it to be a satisfactory conclusion to the series."
5,"A good read, that moves and kept my interest start to finish.",Although fictional history the events and surroundings are on the mark making the authors picture all the more interesting. A story well told.
2,a sequel that was absolutely unnecessary and needed,"after the great first 'north and south', this sequel actually spoiled the greatness of it. this sequel is absolutely uncalled for, way over the top and overdone. the first book, like most readers reviewed, was a great novel that should be in part of the american history. the trilogy was an overkill."
1,Pitiful,"As other reviewers note, this story takes place mostly in the west. Having (unfortunately) read all three books in the trilogy, this one was most disappointing of all. There were long, long passages that were simply too boring to read (particularly Charles' tramping about out west), and I found myself skipping ahead to find parts more interesting (like Ashton's adventures). Jakes' depiction of the Reconstruction Era is downright offensive. He almost completely overlooks the political corruption and scandal of the period in favor of promoting ideals that did not yet exist (and wouldn't for another century). Like all Jakes' novels, this book says more about the author's own agenda than it does about the period he's trying to depict."
4,freaking madness,"every time i die appeared to be the crazy hardcore music i craved one day so i grabbed the album.from note one i was pushed back in my chair.these guys are crazy.sometimes you lose track of what's goin on.but man this stuff is awesome to pump up and get crazy to.the guitar riffs are extremely powerful and drive this album.and unlike most hardcore bands, you can actually understand this singer's words for the most part, and his voice is not as high shrilled or grating as most other hardcore bands.the drumming is superb and he really keep sup with the fast paced belting guitar work.they actually don't do all that much punk type beats at all which is always good.and all of their breakdowns are extremely creative and fun to listen to.all in al, if you want to jump into the hardcore music scene, this album is a solid start."
1,Sell outs !,"OKay, i have etid's ""last night in town"" and i realy do love that album but ""hot damn"" realy, realy sucked big time! I was expecting that heavy & fast & brutal hardcore sound but insted what i got was a rip off of crapy bands like glassjaw (yuck i hate them!) deftones(their awful) and there was not hardcore or metal in this whats so ever...Therefore, etid are nothing but sell outs and a disgrace to the metalcore scene. Skip this album and get their previous ""last night in town"" now thats an great album but hot damn is awful! Don buy it!"
1,This is not music,"This is dog crap wrapped in plastic and passed off as music. I am seriously amazed so many people are rating this 5 stars.I saw them open for As I Lay Dying early this year and boy did they SUCK. Their set dragged on for ages and I was just waiting for it to be over from the first song. The guitarist with the beer gut couldn't play for crap. In fact none of them can. The vocalist is perhaps the worst I've ever heard. Super whiny and annoying yells and screams. No creative riffing, terrible vocals, everything about ETID sucks.To call them ""metalcore"" or ""metal"" like so many are is an insult to the genre. Real quality metalcore would be stuff like Caliban, Heaven Shall Burn, and As I Lay Dying. ETID belongs in the ""crapcore"" category with bands like the Blood Brothers."
1,I Wish they would Die,"These guys are terrible. They give good metal bands a bad name and really the whole genre of hardcore if you ask me. This cd reminds me of trying to take a dump when your constipated but only a pebble of crap comes out so you go to your bed with a pain in your stomach.You really have to wonder how a band that blows this much manages to get signed and have a solid fanbase.It just goes to show you how stupid the industry is.If you have a chance pick up the new Trivium cd ""Ascendancy"" and then you will hear a truly talented band."
4,"Damn, this is good. haha","Im really diggin the new Everytime I Die album. You have to give it a few listens to catch most of the things that are occuring in the album. The music is on many different levels. The tone changes from mathcore to screamo, with some breakdowns thrown in for good measure. If you are a fan of ETID then i recommend that you definitely get get this album. Also, if you are just getting into hardcore and you want to give something new a try, then this is for you too."
3,Average,"This is basically your normal cd. Has a few good tracks, and 1-3 great tracks.Ebolorama is the best track on the album. It's one of my all-time favorite songs.The other stand-out song is She's My Rushmore.Apart from that, this album isn't all that exciting."
3,Eh.....Eh;...,"Jeez I'm so in the middle on this work. It's a different approach than other metalcore, but sometimes it sounds too punky for its own good. All the songs are ALLLRRRIIIIGGGHHHTT I suppose. It really is quite a mediocre album.I'm too in the middle but I guess I recommend it. It definitely rocks from beginning to end and if youre looking for that, than you've come to the right place."
2,Not really a fan of this metalized style of hardcore!,"This record has like three songs I like, which includes the video song Ebolorama. While there are a lot of rhythm changes, they're too metalized, it's progressive and technical, but it's not really groove laden like more of a thrashy type or punky type of hardcore style. It's more mechanical like how a death metal band plays, it's a real stiff kind of a robotic kind of sound. All these types of bands doing the metalcore thing are more metal than hardcore and tend to draw from the same well musically like Norma Jean, Converge, Atreyu and etc."
2,Not worth your time,"No, it's not near-perfect and original. It's hard to be original when you're up on stage just yelling into a microphone with d-tuned guitars making every song sound somewhat alike. I DO NOT like ETID for a lot of reasons. These guys tend to be the favorite of every indie scene kid trying to branch out into some other genre. It's probably the lyrics. I find nothing satisfying about the lyrics, the tone, or the message that this band conveys. There are plenty of truly excellent hardcore bands that are more original than this, but that shouldn't matter. Botch, Converge, Coalesce, and older Cave-In blow these guys away."
1,absolute crap,"i am had the displeasure of seeing these guys live w/lamb of god on an ozzfest off date show.... i must say this is some of the worst ""hardcore"" ever they are so unoriginal and at a complete loss of talent. live they stunk up it up worse than Atreyu did and as we all know they suck live. the album from ETID takes things to a whole different level, at least live i didn't have to hear that obnoxious whining repeated over and over on the album, overall this is one of the worst knock-off hardcore bands on earth."
5,das ist gud,"It is a fine cd to own. My friend this is simple advise, buy the cd. Yes this is the shortest review I'll ever do in my life."
2,Pretty dull,"With the exception of track 7, this isn't a very good offering. Noisecore/metalcore/whatever you want to call it was at one time a very interesting genre full of potential. But inevitably it became oversaturated with carbon copy bands, same as any other music style. It's just not fun anymore.Check out Botch instead."
5,Definately worth it!,"This is a great knife set. I had a set of old, cheap knives that I abused for several years before receiving the Anolon carving set for Christmas. The high quality of the set (8"" slicing knife and a carving fork) convinced me to buy the entire set. The knives are very sharp and comfortable to use, as well as being aesthetically pleasing. The only criticism I would have is the construction of the knife block, which isn't the best but does the job."
4,"Finally, Knives that really work without spending a fortune...","The Anolon Brunello knives are really nice. Not only do they cut well, they look great on the counter. Most knife sets come with black handles and I did not want that look. These knives are beautiful and cut through most everything with ease. I am thrilled with my purchase and I felt that the price of these knives were comparable to other name brands. We were also impressed because the knives are made in Germany of forged steel, all one piece. What a great Christmas gift with all the holiday cooking we did!!"
1,Terrible blu-ray!!,"I purchased this item, couldnt wait to watch it, and then, here! Everything is upscaled, which didnt make me happy at all! Then, I watched it later on, and some episodes have the mouths moving after they say a line! That really p**sed me off! The worst thing is that the only thing in HD is the menu, and the Warning! The Gaiam ads are upscaled too! And when you watch the Superman blu-ray, there is a Gaiam logo on the bottom!! I thought those people who reviewed were crazy, but unfortunately, I was wrong! Avoid this blu-ray if you know whats good for ya!! When you read the side, it actually says ""2-disc DVD set"". I repeat ""DVD""!"
5,A+ Pregnancy Handbook,This book is used in my first trimester pregnancy classes. I looked at over 30 books to use in my classes. Hats off to Dorling Kindersley for a job well done!! The pages are bright and crisp. The pictures are laid out in just the right spots. The book covers pre-conception to Birth and beyond. It is a perfect first time mother's handbook. Enjoy!!
5,A pregnancy must have!,"A teriffic book! I enjoyed how this book was written, organized and presented to the reader. It is truly a must have if you are expecting or expecting to be expecting! I was impressed by the pictures/graphics and the chronicalling of a pregnancy. The information grouped by weeks and trimester easy to read and understand. Many of the questions I had were presented with easy to understand answers. Even my husband enjoyed this book--he read more of this book than any of the other pregnancy references I have brought home. We will definatiely be grabbing this book off the shelf as my pregnancy progresses!"
4,Fitting and Showing the Halter Horse,"Fitting and Showing the Halter Horse is a good book the for the begginer to advanced showmanship/Halter exibitor. It shows you the finer points of what the judge is looking for in you and your horse. I recomend this book if you have just started showing a horse. It realy helps you out in what equiptment to by, grooming tips, what to do when you get into the ring and much, much more!!!!"
5,Pretty Good,"This book was very helpful. It demonstrated many different ways or wrapping, trailering, braiding, ect. It covers showing for english, western, and halter. You learn some good tricks, and tech. The only thing I missed, was that it didn't cover very much in the way of actually showing in halter. Then again, it was only intended to cover how to prepare for stuff, and it really goes beyond that.I recommend it to anyone who wants to know diff. ways to braid, leg wrap, and other things."
4,"Older book, but worth reading","This book was written in the 70's, so the pictures and information is a bit older. Overall, its a great book to give you a general overview of what horse to buy, how to prepare a horse for show, what things you will need to buy, how to condition and feed. I was happy with the purchase."
3,Does not replace reading time,"This is a great alternative to Dora; however, it does not replace story time with my child. I found this book for my 3-year-old last year and we loved singing the song before bedtime. When we found this online, we thought it would be a great addition to her DVD collection. The video sets the book to music, but the words do not match the book at all times. My child enjoyed dancing to the music and watching the animation, but at the end of the day, we enjoy reading and singing the book together before bedtime."
2,Not what I expected,This dvd wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting it to be more like the cassette that came with our book but it wasn't. I read this book and played the tape with my daughter when she was little and it calmed her down so I thought the dvd would be a nice addition but the way they sang it was totally different. She had no interest in it. The other stories are old in production also. Wish it would have been better.
2,Disappointment,"I guess the fact my 21 month old seems to like the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom video should be enough. I keep trying to like it because the idea of it sounds so cute. I originally bought a set with book and cassette tape. My son likes to listen to me read the ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" rhyme but seems to find the drawings in the book uninteresting. I thought the drawings and rhyme in the book might improve with some snappy video animation and music--but the animation on this video is poor quality, cheap, and slow. My husband calls the video, especially the music, ""odious."" So far, my 21 month old likes the first 2 cartoons on the video (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and Trashy Town) but he won't sit through the final two (I can't blame him). If you want some videos your toddler should really like, I recommend Richard Scarry's ""Best ABC"" and ""Best Counting Videos Ever"""
5,Great video choice for preschoolers!,"Hooray for Scholastic for bundling these fabulous videos in an affordable format for home viewing! The quality of these Weston Woods/Scholastic videos of children's books is unparalleled: the production value is great, the original music and songs are infectious, and they are very true to the books on which they're based. Each of the videos included on this collection is destined to become a favorite with your preschooler, and I'd recommend other collections in the Scholastic video library as well. My daughter loves them so much, I decided to give them as gifts this Christmas."
5,Great Learning DVD,My 3yr old absolutely loves this DVD. He now knows the words to the songs and sings along. He is learning to recognize letters with the help of this cute and catchy production.
4,Lots of Fun,"My Boys, ages 2 and 4, enjoy watching this video. The older boy was not one for books, but watching the stories helped him make the jump to enjoying reading. This DVD has a read-along feature, where the words are displayed on the screen. The music is catchy and enjoyable."
4,Kids love it!,"My kids are 6 and 2, and this is one video they will both watch together. Chicka chicka boom boom is so catchy, I find myself singing along with it. We all like it a lot. My son also loves Trashy Town, which is about a garbage man driving around picking up trash in his garbage truck. The other stories are entertaining as well, but the first two are my kids' favorites. I like some of the Scholastic videos a lot, and this is one of my two favorites (along with Good Night Gorilla). I recommend it to anyone with young children. Also, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom helps younger children learn the alphabet as well."
5,ABC's gone hip,I read this book to my nephew when he was 4. I was not impressed. Then I found out the sentences were actually lyrics to an adorable song. I recommend this DVD so that you can hear the song and sing along with your kids. It's a great way to sing the ABC's and the animation is cute. The other stories are entertaining as well.
3,Big Bug Cards,"The cards are really big and thick. There were 26 in the box, I was hoping there was more. Some of the pictures are really nice, but others are kindve blurry and hard to see. Some cards will have an accurate name such as european honey bee, while other cards are really general and just say butterfly. Not quite what I wanted."
5,"CLACK CLACK ""SALUTE""","This group and CD is Hip-Hop's most slept on. I have been listing to M.O.P. on mix tapes for sometime now and was waiting for them to leave the underground scene and BLOW UP, but the commercial side of Hip-hop was not to fond of these true Hip-Hop Artist. Honestly it does not get any realer than these two, on every track they spit fire at you, line after line is fierce. Go get it and you'll feel what I feel on this one. Now we know who Mystical is trying to sound like."
3,"OK, but not great","This video was very average. Of course, you see alot of lovely female flesh from the ladies of the WWF (Tori, Kat, Ivori, Terri, and Trish). The only problem is that this video runs for 60 minutes, and after seeing it for 30 minutes it starts to get a little boring. Clips of the ladies PPV and Raw appearances are included too, which is cool.A word of advice to parents, though- this video DOES contain nudity (the Kat removes her top and it is uncensored). But, at least the clip of 80-year-old Mae Young removing her swimsuit at the Royal Rumble WAS censored (Thank God).So, to summarize- great if you like to see the ladies of the WWF in swimsuits and sexy outfits (and really, who doesn't?), but the tape runs a little too long and gets boring after awhile."
5,Sex Sells,"The first one really is the best! If you aren't buying this just because all of the ladies are gone..you are a jack-off! *lol* It shows some in ring stuff as well as the ladies in really skimpy and tight clothing and in some cases,what they're wearing shouldn't be considered clothing. The WWE really did have alot more attitude back in the day and the product was alot more edgy. You can see Kat's and Tori's breasts in this..don't worry, they censor Mae Young! Buy it if you're a fan, you will love it."
5,THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL!!!,"Ivory, the Kat, Terri Runnels, Tori, and the introduction of the greatest of all time Trish Stratus. This DVD started all the other divas dvds. It has the sexiest scenes that you will ever see. The Kat and Terri shwo why they were queens of skin, and Trish Stratus shows why she is going to become the all-time queen of wrestling entertainment. (wet t-shirt, oh baby)"
1,total waste of time & money,"This is so bad, it's a total waste of money and time. I'll never buy another WWF Diva series again. Hire some WCW quality Divas please!!!"
5,One of the best books on MCS,"My wife suffers from MCS. As such, I have read most of the books available concerning MCS. Most books are from a medical professional covering a particular medical theory or treatment plan for MCS. What makes this book different is that it really explains the impact of MCS on people's lives. It dispells the myths surrounding the various treatments. The book is based upon surveys and interviews with hundreds of MCS patients. As such, the advice is based upon their experiences. When discussing treatments, statistics are provided on how many people were helped, how many harmed, how many uncertain.This books is great for those new to MCS, those who have been around a long time, those who are patients, those who know someone with MCS.I would recommend this book be added to anyone's library. This is not the only excellent book on MCS ... it is now simply the first book I recommend that people read."
4,with James Darren in his first movie,"This is James Darren first movie. Supporting : Robert BlakeI was wondering about this (for me unknow) movie. It is in black and white and letterbox 1:1,85. When you've a 16:9 TV and fills your screen full.The Picture quality is not perfect but pretty good (for not restored / remastered). The Soundtrack is in mono.Subtitles: noneStory: Based on the novel Rumble on the Docks by Frank Paley (New York, 1953) and was filmed on the docks of San Pedro, CA.Fazit: Its a entertaining B-Picture"
4,Hey,"I know that everybody complains about how there is only four episodes on this vol., but if you get the first season box set, you'll find that they had to do that because there are only 22 episodes in a season! If they put all of the episodes on three DVD's, they would need an extra one for the rest of the special features. And I agree, the episodes Harper 2.0 and The Mathimatics of Tears were great episodes.PS. I am the proud owner of seasons 1 through 3, all box sets!"
3,More Please,"I really like Andromeda and the series is great. The contents are good, but for 2 discs worth of material they only had 4 episodes on them. They need to put at least 6 episodes to a volume if they aren't going to put that much extra material on them. Either that or lower the price of the vol."
5,A Great Album,"This is the BEST Bone thug offshoot ever. The Poetic Husta'z need to put out another album. This album was tight from front to back, beginning to end. There's not a weak track on it. If they ever get another record deal and put out a new album, I'll buy it the first day it comes out. Unless, of course, there's no promotion and I never hear about it.... They need to come out with a new album for real!"
1,Not the About Tao - no question.,"I bought this book at a book store a few weeks ago. I couldn't get much past page 18 where she defined ""te"" like Yoda, ""do or do not do, there is no try"". To me ""doing"" anything deliberately and with force is NOT a part of practicing Tao, period. After that definition I began questioning everything I read. Too many of her definitions were based on absolutes and force. I started to read about te in _Simple Taoism: A Guide to Living in Balance_ and realized that Diane Dreher might not know what she was talking about so much. So I came here to see if this was true. From the first review I read, I'm satisfied that what I felt about her writing is true. I will return the book immediately.However, remember I didn't get much past page 18. Read all the reviews, browse the book and make your own decision.Read this instead:Simple Taoism: A Guide to Living in Balance"
3,"okay, but not one of the first to read","I've read many other taoism books that I would recommend above this one. The writing style here is too wordy, unlike the pithy nature of the tao te ching. Some people like this more ""novel"" like style, but if you'd like a book that you can re-read many times, this isn't a good choice. Read others first, and then if you read this, it will give you a different viewpoint."
5,Finding Peace In A Book,"I absolutely loved this book. It was very informative and insightful; I could barely put it down. I learned how important it is to achieve spiritual peace with your own mind, body, and environment, before reaching peace at a higher community, national, world level. This book is a must-read for anyone who has read the Tao of Peace and for those of you who need a way to de-stress and wind-down your hectic daily life into a more simplistic, wordly, peaceful life."
1,I didn't think it was very good.,"A lot of personal stories which make's the reader feel close to the author. But a little self serving? In my life I have felt making comparisons is more harmful than anything. This book on almost every page says ""A Tao does this... a non Tao person is this and that"" I feel it puts certain people down because they are not one specific way. Being ""One with the Tao"" is not about comparison or elimination. I could not finish reading more than 60-70% of this book. There are however, some very good exercises for someone new to this, in that right I do recommend it :)"
2,Too much on personal politics,"I whole heartedly agree with the other reviewer on 'preaching militant environmentalism'. I, too, thought it was way out of place. The other disturbing aspect that kept me from focusing on the book was the smarmy comment about what a positive thing it was to be a part of an anti war movement during the Viet Nam war. Now, whether I agree or not, I just thought this was really pressing an opinion on a subject I surely did not buy this book for. Had I known these smug, self righteous opinions were to be a part of this book I would never have purchased it. Is it truly following the Tao by trying to inject your personal political agenda on others? Am I supposed to follow your path or find my own way?"
1,too new age,"She uses taoism to fit her personal beliefs rather than adapting her beliefs to fit the philosophy. It's clear she doesn't have a good grasp on what taoism is really all about. Her version is way too new age, holistic, hippie tripe for me. Further the book is written in such puerile language as if it is intended for children, give the reader some credit."
4,"Good book, too many personal stories","I love all of the Tao quotes in this book, they are all deep and thought provoking; each true in many ways. There are two drawbacks to this book; the personal stories, the ""tree-hugging"" and the small amount of actual quotes from the Tao Te Jing. Overall though, a good read and kept my attention the whole way through."
5,What a pleasure! The best Merrill Biography.,"As a Baritone voice student with an outstanding voice coach, I do what she tells me to do. She suggested listening toMerrill as well as Dietrich Fischer-Descau (as each of these Baritones had some qualities similar to my voice).I decided to read up on them and fell upon this book. What a wonderful read. I am told a great deal of thanks goes to the ghosts writer but all I care about is that I fellt Merrill's voice came through. Humble, passionate and just a regular guy who loved going to work each day."
1,sucks,"dont buy it, they converted from PDF to text file, and did not correct mistakes made by machines. You will never understand this story if you read this version."
2,Interesting Theory but where's the proof?,"The authors present an interesting theory but are we really ready to believe that John Dean led people like Haldeman, Mitchell and Nixon around by the nose? Come on! The burglars were definitely looking for something in O'Brien's office but it certainly wasn't focused on prostitutes. And where are the footnotes? How can a serious historian check the accuracy of the authors' claims if we can't check what people really said?There are much more interesting and plausible theories as to what the burglars were looking for--but we'll have to wait for more of the White House tapes to be released."
3,Small Correction,"The reference in the book to St. Irene finding the True Cross is incorrect. In Natasha's Russian Orthodox tradition the finder of the True Cross is identified as St. Helen, the mother of St. Constantine the Great. The reference to St. Irene was perhaps a Freudian slip on the part of the author."
2,"THE BEST IS YET TO COME: RING, RING IS A SOPHMORIC EFFORT","I originally purchased this album on vinyl (anyone remember that format?) from a Swedish record dealer during the late 1970s. At that time an ABBA obsessive, I was rather confused as to why ""Ring, Ring"" had never been released in the U.S. After hearing the tracks on this album, I understood why Atlantic had chosen against issuing it stateside. While some of the songs, particularly ""Ring, Ring"" itself, Agnetha's compilation ""Disillusion"" and ""I'm Just a Girl"" are pleasant enough, others, such as ""Rock 'n' Roll Band"" and ""Me and Bobby's..."" are shockingly bad. To be fair, every ABBA LP contained at least one song that should have remained in the vaults, and this effort was issued very early in their collective career. The preponderence of awful songs on this album, however, makes it one to skip for all but the most die-hard fans."
2,crude beginnings,"Listening to this you may be forgiven for marvelling how ABBA became as great as they did. Even as a first album it's a dud, full of clodhopping songs with clumsy lyrics, and as such is fit only for the absolute fanatic."
2,"My least favorite ""debut"" album","Madonna and Britney Spears had great first albums. However, this isn't one of them. While I enjoy ABBA's later albums, this one never quite rises above silly with a bunch of fillers. One example is ""Me and Bobby and Bobby's Brither."" Gosh, it's annoying now!!! I used to like it. After ABBA evolved into more mature artists (by next years 'Waterloo,' they were already MUCH better) they are more enjoyable. Far more than this ... piece of immature ...."
4,"Good Product, shipped quickly","So, what can one say about a filter? I guess an expert could say a great deal, but I'm not an expert. The company shipped the filters quickly. The filters fit the frame. The filters get ""dirty"" in a few days. It does what I expected."
4,Filtrete clean air replacement filters,Great product at an even greater price!I'm totally happy with mypurchase!I will always get my replacements at amazon.com!
3,Good product - bad marketing,"I bought my air cleaning unit at Wal-Mart and it came with one filter. When it came time to replace the dirty filter, guess what? You can't buy them at Wal-Mart. I did find them at Amazon (of course), but wowwww these things are expensive. A pack of four air cleaner filters for $69?? OK, I'm a chump and bought them. I think it does a pretty good job, but man I could have bought some gas or something for that kind of money. 3M should give away the air cleaning units just so they can sell the filters. So, this is one of those products that is actually good, but the politics of it all kind of ticks you off."
2,The Replacement Filter for..FAP02,"Im giving the ""replacement filters"" 2 stars.Only because they are overpriced ....and..Very hard to find.Why isnt this a shelf item at retail stores?They need to be replaced regularly , I dont want to hunt around looking for replacement filters..Bad move..They work great, easy to install....very limited places to purchase this filter."
3,OK but SOOOO pricey,"I'm giving this 3 stars. Yes, these filters do their job in my dusty loft apartment. But they don't last particularly long, and their price is stiff to say the least. 4 stars for performance, 2 stars for price.Also they do a terrible job marking the air purifier unit itself and the proper replacement. The wrong manual came with my unit and I had to do a lot of hunting to find the right filter."
5,"Filtrete Clean Air,",Great price on these filters when buying the 4-pack. I didn't realize how dirty this world is until I changed my filter. Thank you Fridge Filters and Amazon.
4,A Solid Read,"This is an excellent, suspenseful novel. What I found most enjoyable about the book is the way in which Bingham makes the psychological aspects of a crime more important than a crime itself. I found myself, as a reader, thinking about the motivations of the characters and their lives far more than I did about whether or not one of them would get knocked off. Part of this, I think, is because of Bingham's taut writing style. He uses short sentences and paragraphs to set the mood and then leaves a lot of the thinking behind his words to dictate how one experiences the story."
3,What motivates murder?,"Solid crime story. Not a mystery, but rather an exploration of the psychology that could prompt an average person to contemplate murder, and ultimately to be able to commit murder. This is also known as 'The Tender Poisoner'"
3,Murder in Altdorf,"This is a rather generic murder mystery set in the world of Warhammer fantasy. It is included as the third novel in the excellentThe Vampire Genevieveomnibus, although it hardly involves Genevieve at all. The principle character is Johann von Mecklenburg, an aristocrat that we've met in previous books. The story involves Johann and a few other characters trying to solve the mystery behind a spree of gruesome murders. Suspicions are spread around a number of side characters, keeping the reader guessing as to who may be the real killer.While you get some pretty graphic violence and a unique look into the psyche of some twisted individuals (something that Yeovil is so good at), this book just didn't grab my attention like most other Warhammer books have. Predictable and with somewhat flat characters, BEASTS IN VELVET doesn't live up to Yeovil's other work."
5,Castle glass cleaner,A friend of mine told me about this product saying it is streak free and perfect. Like the windows from a car wash. Sure enough she was right. It works perfectly and streak-free. The bonus is that it has the most pleasant smell that works like a room freshner. You can smell it for a while and it makes the whole experience fabulous. I HIGHLY recommend it.
4,Castle Glass Cleaner,"WOULD JUST LIKE YOU TO KNOW THAT """"CASTLE WINDOW CLEANER""""IS THE BEST ITEM THAT I HAVE EVER HAD FOR CLEANING WINDOW'S & GLASS, THANK'S TO MY NEPHEW-IN-LAW WHO IS A CAR DETAILER. NO STREAK'S!! AND IT WIPE'S RIGHT OFF, WITH NO RUBBING. THANK YOU """"CASTLE ORIGINAL""""."
3,Ginger?,"I was expecting this fragrance to have more of a ginger scent, since it's called White Ginger, but it's actually more of a light musk scent. I really don't smell any ginger in it. It's not a bad fragrance, I just wish there was more of a gingery note to it."
2,Not Completely Satisfied,"I was satisfied until 14 months after I got it the thing decided to stop reading both DVD's and CD's. I used it normally in my home and was just starting to get a decent DVD collection and it did this.It was a fine product up until this event but considering the price of DVD players I dont think its something people want to keep buying so to let you know it doesnt work after 14 months! Also when you try and contact JVC they dont get back to you.I would advise you to look around for a different product, I wish I had, and if anyone has any suggestions for me as to how to fix this please let me know .Thanks"
3,issues with installation,"I purchased this Borla header #17039 for my 1995 Jeep Cherokee 4.0 4wd. This is a well built header system...but...there should be an installation note from Borla that states that you MUST start the lower bolt that goes into the head after the #4 exhaust pipe before you install the intake manifold. You WILL NOT get that bolt in. The exhaust pipe is angled back too much and this prevents you from getting that bolt in. Then, when you try to get a socket on that bolt, your socket will be on an angle so watch your knuckles. (maybe change that bolt to an allen or socket head bolt would do the trick) The other issues that I had were that the crossover pipe ends were not round I had to resize the ends with a hammer and some tubing, also the bung placement for the O2 is to the rear so you will need to splice in some wire so that they do not contact the header."
5,Go OEM on laptop batteries or go home!!,"After going through two aftermarket batteries from a reputable maker that offered a warranty etc. and having both fail within less than 6 months I went back to OEM and I haven't looked back. OEM is the way to go unless you just like banging your head against the wall fighting to ""warranty"" those cheaper aftermarket batteries that just don't last."
2,creature from the black lagoon,"yo compre esta pelicula pensando que clint eastwood iva a estar ahi , pero no lo veo , o no se si tengo que ver la pelicula completa para verlo a el o quizas el trabajo en otra version de esa pelicula."
4,It Came From The Saturday Matinee..,"There's an art house theater near where I live that sometimes shows Creature in all it's 3D glory. What a treat! Creature and I were born in the same year , so the first place I actually saw him was at the drive-in.This DVD is a wonderful way to revisit those art house and drive-in showings of yesteryear. The video transfer is sharp and sound quality excellent.The two sequels are included , with Revenge of The Creature probably now most famous for Clint Eastwood's film debut. There is a great documentary and commentary tracks on all three films."
5,Creature of the Black Lagoon DvD,Awesome! I'd recommend this movie to everyone who saw it in the theater as a child!
2,Universal Screws Up...AGAIN,"Granted, it would have been nice of Universal to release the relevant disks in this set in the original 3-D; after all, 13 Ghosts, for instance, can be viewed at home as its director intended. However, I'm willing to make allowances based on the fact that there's really not a whole lot of 3-D product out there. No, my complaint is based on Universal's having released the set in the wrong aspect ratio; the releases are presented full-frame, despite the theatrical releases' having been shot (and exhibited) widescreen (naysayers can confirm by checking out DVD Savant's review). Would it have been so much trouble to have released nice, correctly cropped, anamorphic prints, especially since they would have cost no more to produce than pan-and-scan? Add this to your list of complaints to Universal--maybe they'll at some point start releasing product with the respect it deserves if enough people gripe (although I, for one, doubt it)."
4,The Creature really gets his revenge!,"Can't touch the original but is worth viewing! The story would do better to track the original line with more exposure in the wild, not an amusement park!"
2,not the same,"This movie is more focused on the humans in the story. It is NOT as suspenseful 5as ""TheCreature..."" and has a very perdicable plot. The movie standing byi itself was a typical B movie...boy girl like each other/capture monster/monster escapes and get revenge-the end....."
4,creature feature,"had not seen the movie in a long, long, time. scared me to death as a kid - hid behind my dad's chair. it was fun to see it now...packaging was great - no problems with the disks. enjoy"
3,WHERE'S THE 3-D???,"This a great dvd collection, the creature effects in these movies are still amazing looking even today,but i'm still disappointed that the first two were not in 3D like at the theatres,i remember watching it late night on tv in its 3D glory, sitting there with my 3D glasses on,jumping when the creature came close to the screen,or when some of the fish swimming by looked like they coming out the tv.Thank God they didn't try to colorize it like some classic movies but i still wish they would have saved the 3D effects so future viewers could've enjoyed what Black Lagoon movie watchers my age did so many years ago."
3,Creat. Blk Lgn,The set is ok. THe main feature is on a single sided disc. I still think it would be better without the double sided disc. This set comes with a cheesy little piece of foam to protect the 2nd disc from being scratched. It would have pleased customers more if the 2nd disc was on two single sided discs packaged to reflect the price paid for what should be a good boxed set of old Universal movies.
4,3 for the price of 1,"I bought this for The Creature from the Black Lagoon. The box set was pretty much the same price as the single video, so i got it. It's pretty-well put together and well, other people have written about the plots. If you want one of the movies, it's worth getting all three."
4,Creature from the Black Lagoon / Revenge of the Creature / The Creature Walks Among Us,"Great 50's Sci-Fi movies. I rememeber the 3-D images, long after they went out of use. Technoligy should be able to put that aspect back into the movies at some point. The only draw back to the collection is that there should be a widescreen version avialable."
5,Not in 3D but for the DVDs and videos that's ok.,"As you probably read that these films are classics and ,Creature From the Black Lagoon and Revenge of the Creature were originally on 3D , but it's better not to have the DVDs on 3D (It's Not). In 1989 MCA released a restored copy of the 3D version(not on amazon.com) but when you put on your Blue and Red glasses you just end up seeing the images very off focus and blue and red everywhere. Recently I viewed this movie my local theater in 3D and 3D effect was GREAT! I found later that this movie is was not good on video because (unless you has a EXTREMELY large T.V.) that the images will be overlapping. I now own the 1999 video copy not in 3D and it is still a 5 Star film."
3,Creature From The Black Lagoon Stalks Again,"CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON:The acting was good...so were the special effects. But it got kind of hard to understand scientists meeting deadly creatue in the Amazon River. I liked this movie alot.3 stars,1954,B&W;,Rated G,80 minutesREVENGE OF THE CREATURE:A good overall sequel to the original has the Gill Man being taken to an aquarium in Florida where he escapes. Equally good acting but minor special effects. Another good movie. It is amazing when he flips over the new car.3 stars,1955,B&W;,Not Rated,81 minutesCREATURE WALKS AMONG US:The final Creature film is not as good. This time,the Creature is captured by depressed scientists who almost turn him human. Another rampage at the end. Maybe the new directer had to do with it. The Creature is very strong this time2 stars,1956,Not Rated,79 minutes"
1,I never found this very entertaining.,"By the early 1950's, Universal was in the business of making true creature B-Movies with these three movies offered in this boxed set as real low budget creature features. The Creature of the Black Lagoon suit is just as you see it. A man wearing a poorly made suit and it was shot in 3D. Too bad some A-list actors were cast in these drek films.They say that these movies influence movies today, which ones? Those that go straight to home video?!"
4,Good Creature Features,"The Creature From The Black Lagoon is near masterpiece. It's too bad, then, that Revenge of the Creature and The Creature Walks Among Us are a cut below. Still, worth owning for The Creature From The Black Lagoon."
4,Scarey Movie,"I watched this as a young boy and was scared to death. My kids watched it and, while, predictably scared, enjoyed it and have seen it over 3 times now. Great old Sci Fi and well done."
5,A treasure,"All three of the creature movies and all kinds of extras.The only thing I never liked about these movies was the underwater scenes which I think detracted from it, but the people who made them thought it was important enough to spend alot of resources to produce those scenes. I guess it is a matter of taste.These movies were made in the 50's and stand head and shoulders over most of the others. The Creature and one other, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms came out nearly at the same time and both were lavishly produced and blockbusters of the day. Their quality is obvious.I often wonder why the Creature films have never been remade - since everything else has been.This set is well worth it. Ya they dont have 3D like the originals, but if they come out with them, I will buy them too."
4,Classics in Movie Making,"I have been a sci fi devotee for almost 50 years and always enjoyed the old classic movies. THe Creature Movies Represent a beloved era in fiction, and I am extremely pleased with being able to purchase same. AMAZON appears to have all areas for easy purchase and prompt delivery sown up. I highly recommend them to all. B W Dilworth"
3,"Good General Review of Subject, But Out of Date","Cults and New Faiths looks at many of the fringe religious groups running around in the late 20th century. Its strengths are that it wonderfully introduces each cult to the reader, and describes the group's beliefs and doctrines well. Orthodox Christian belief is contrasted with cult belief in each section. Large photographs are common throughout the book; something you won't find in most books on cults. Enthusiasts for political correctness will disapprove of the author's bias against these groups, though, and so should probably not bother reading the book. It should also be noted that it is rather out of date by now, and needs some revisions and updates. For those already familiar with cults, other books will prove more helpful."
1,Another Redundant Collection,"When will Polydor stop and think for a minute about how they want to re-issue the James Brown catalogue? How many times will they release ""Make it Funky"", ""Please Please Please"", ""My Thang"", ""Get on the Good Foot"", ""Doing it to Death"", and the twenty or so other extremely redundant titles? Where, for example, are ""rare"" tracks like ""Papa's got a NEW brand New Bag"" from ""Everybody's Doin' the Hustle"" or ""Give the Bass Player Some"" from ""NonStop""?Though this is a decent collection, it is sad that so much good stuff is locked in the vaults, while the same songs keep ending up on different CD's (""Star Time"", ""20 Greatest Hits"", ""CD of JB 1 & 2"", ""Dead on the Heavy Funk"", ""Funk Power 1970"", ad nauseum)."
5,The Best James Brown Collection,"IF YOUR JUST STARTING YOUR JAMES BROWN JOURNEY, OR YOU WANT SOMETHING TO TIDE YOU OVER UNTIL YOU CAN GET THE REST I'D SUGGEST THIS ONE. THERE ISN'T A SKIPPABLE TRACK ON THE ALBUM."
5,When We Were Kings,James Brown has that 'soulthing'; spreading words like clouds. Groovy beats which lift your feet. With songs like 'The Payback' 'Out Of Power' 'My Thang' and 'Night Train'. JB is a phenomenal artist and this double CD presents it to tha fullest. Go buy it!
5,"the minister of new new super heavy funk, 1933-2006.","not many words need to be said of how the whole world is feeling right now about the man we know as james brown, who has went on to be with the Good Lord Our father, who art in soulful heaven. the man always will be the hardest working man in show business, who's music and passion have kept him in full public view for over 50 years. and we won't even talk about hits!! the man had too many to count!! which still wouldn't be enough , if you asked me...lol...even up to his last performance here in joliet, illinois at the rialto square theater this past september, he still gave it all he got. mr. brown, your efforts, accomplishments, and achievements will not go unoticed by my, and a whole lot of others, too. the funk and soul of your power will shine on in the hearts of all music lovers and appreciaters all over the world!!! goodbye, mr. star time."
4,Excellent!,"A little on the pricey side compared to what you can buy at a grocery, but that's what you pay for getting WPT cards (and a fan of the WPT would appreciate the gift) but they also included a bonus set of playing cards, and the product arrived very quickly. It met and exceeded my expectations as a customer. They even put smiley faces on my reciept. :-)"
1,Over priced and none of the games are known to me,I bought this because I thought it was similar to another product that I bought that had 89 games in one handheld console. the other one cost me $22. This thing costed me $35 and it only has 20 games and I have heard of none of them... sorry. It looks nice. But is among the most inferior of these types of products.
4,Decent Little Handheld Game,"This little handheld game is great for money. Loads of fun. The only negative I have is that the graphics are confusing with the Mario type games. The pixels on the graphics are a little too small making it hard to make out what is going on. On a scale of 1 - 10, I give this game a 7."
4,Grandson loves it,"I bought 3 for my grandsons. They use them in the van and when at a restaurant, no arguing in public. Nice extra!"
4,Great set of knives!,"I have this set and love it - the wood handles are absolutely gorgeous (the photo doesn't do them justice), they feel great in the hand, and stay nice and sharp. Granted, I'm not a chef; but for everyday use I've been more than happy with them and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to someone looking for a new set."
3,You get what you pay for...,This item was marginal. It got the job done but does not compare up to brands like Cutco. Life span was about a year before rust started popping up.
1,Low Quality Battery,I used these for my toy car and it leaked in my toy car.Thank god the people who sold me the car gave me a replacement.Never ever use Energizer batteries.Use Duracell M3 instead
4,Nice resource!,"Very useful resource, great for the price! 189 pages covering home, discipline, school issues and advocacy. This contains a beginning section describing gifted traits in case you are not sure of where your child falls, through school and advocacy for gifted legislation. There is a detailed discussion on perfectionism in gifted children. Also in the back of the book and throughout are further resources and a glossary of terms. This is a used 2001 version, there may be a better updated version available re:legislative issues. The age of the version is the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5."
2,The World of Beads,"I read the reviews on this book and thought it would be great- but I don't like the way it is set up, pictures first and then directions in the second half of the book. I also think the directions could be written better- they can be a little bit confusing. I am going to get another book on this subject beacause this one isn't very good."
5,This book is absolutely wonderful,"My daughter loved the Klutz, ""Beadlings"" book. I looked forever for something similar. This is the only book I found similar to the books from Japan I used to buy as a child to make little beaded critters.If you need detailed instructions or do not have seed beed experience this book is NOT for you. It is more intermediate to advanced, but the projects are wonderful."
2,"Old, outdated and incomplete","This book contains information that is soo old its outrageous. It considers a ""large"" web site to be over 50 pages. I dont consider that as being ""large""."
5,GOTTA HAVE DVD,Took a motorcoach group on parts of Route 66 from Illinois to Flagstaff... and used this DVD to inform and relive the journey while on 66.... It was prefect to enhance our experience!!!
5,Good stuff!,Michael Wallis is the premier research for Route 66 and anything he puts out about the road should not be missed. Disc 1 and Disc 3 particularly have good information. I felt like Disc 2 was something he put out because he some leftover footage from the first disc and needed some extra money. But I watched anyway because he did visit some places that weren't on the first one. Group this DVD set with his book and the 8-map set and you're ready to hit the road.
4,Worth having,"Generous 3 disc pack, rather repetitive, preferred Billy Connelly, sorry. Glad however I got it as need maximum information before setting off."
4,Route 66 the ultimate DVD collection,I found this video to be very good and well presented and most informative about route 66.It was almost as good as being there driving the old highway.
3,Some Excellent Moments,"Over the course of her last two solo albums, Anhedoniac (1998) and Disburden Disciple (2001), Jarboe has headed towards more succinct song structures and tighter rhythms. This has culminated in THE MEN ALBUM which contains some of her strongest material yet as well as a judicious and effective use of many guest musicians and singers. My only criticism of the album is that, at nearly 100 minutes, it is far too long and I think a tighter 1 hour album could have been released. Highlights include This Is Life Meridian, To Forget (with Iva Davies of all people), Reason To Live and the gorgeously minimal Penance. Overall, THE MEN is another fascinating chapter in the career of this courageous and compelling artist."
4,Good assortment!,"Although I am not a die hard Clint fan, these are probably the movies I would choose to put in a set. An excelent value for some of the best clint."
1,Poor selection to represent Eastwood,"This selection of 6 DVDs, The Beguiled, Bronco Billy, Dirty Harry, In the Line of Fire, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and Unforgiven, is a poor sampling of his work. Hang'm High would've better represented his earlier work. Bronco Billy is one of his worst films! Any Which Way But Loose would've been a far superior choice. The others are good works, but I will avoid this collection in preference of buying my favorite individual titles."
4,Great Stuff,This is a great book especially for those folks that know nothing about the TV/entertainment industry. Ms. Jordan does an excellent job of detailing the different job descriptions and provides invaluable insider information that one outside the industry would never have access to.
3,[...],I read this book and did get advice on how to create a press kit which is pretty important. I'm pretty sure you'll find something in the book that you can use to get on TV.
3,newbury underappreciated,"Mickey Newbury was a genius singer-songwriter always underappreciated and obscure by the general public. His original version of this album was highly acclaimed by critics and fellow artists and my all time favorite. I get excited any time I hear someone is doing a Newbury song and was anxious to hear this tribute. I congradulate the effort but for the most part disappointed, no one can really do Newbury like Newbury. David Halleys version of Swiss Cottage Place was the best and kudos to Kristofferson, Dave Alvin, and Bill Frisell. Support the Newbury family and check out their website."
1,ONE STAR FOR THE EFFORT,"I'm so sick of these tribute albums. Now that it's back in print, get the real thing. What's the point?"
3,Great stand for cast iron pots,"The stand is a great product. It arrived in good condition and on time and looks great in the house, but the packaging was lousy. It came with the ""feet"" and top of the stand sticking out of the box. That really road-tested the product because it got home without damage despite the lousy packaging.Although it is a good product, I think that the price is high enough to cover some decent packaging material. They should be ashamed of their packaging! You get a new and very expensive product and you have to really really clean it well because it was traveling opened.The stand gets five stars but the packaging gets zero stars. Since there is no option for packaging, I will give three stars.Fix the packaging!!!!"
4,WWF Royal Rumble 2000,This is a pretty good event.The WWF Title Match is unbeleivably bloody. Triple H gets a HUGE chunk of wood stuck in his leg and Cactus Jack gets a faceful of tacs. It was one of the best hardcore matches I have ever seen. The Tag Team Table match was amazing. First Bubba Ray falls off of an entrance doorway atleast 10-15 feet. And then Jeff does the Swanton off the same entrance and goes through a table along with D-VON. I would advise you to stop the bikini contest when May YOung comes out and fast forward a few minutes. You will DEFINATELY not regret it. The actual Royal Rumble match itself is alright but 1999 was the best. I think this was a great ppv and would highly advise you to buy it.
4,WWF Royal Rumble 2000,"1.Tazz vs Angle-Short but good match.2.Table Match-Awesome, especially what Jeff Hardy did.3.Miss Rumble Pageant-AHHH! Mae Young!4.ICT Title Match-OK.5.Street Fight-It was great, just a little bit long.6.Royal Rumble-Awesome, it was funny when Too Cool danced with Rikishi."
3,Common people its not that good,"Triple H and Cactus Jack, Dudleys vs Hardy Boys, even the bikini contest was good, but the rumble itself was 60 minutes the WWF took from my life that I want back, this rivals with 96 as being the worst ever! Everybodys favorite The Rock, (said in 3rd person) walses into the ring and proceeds to get the crap beaten out of him for pretty much the entire match, not a way for the WWF to put over its top star. The Road-dog takes the cake as the most laziest wrestler of all as he literally lays down for around 23 minutes curled up in the corner, the only real high point is when Taka Mishinoku gets thrown over and land on his head, nice shot. Buy for Cactus and the Game only!"
3,"Nasty,wrinkled,stankay,PUPPIES!","The event was straight overall,but Mae Young flashed everyone and it was a nasty,horrible,disgusting,sight! Other than that moment,the PPV was pretty cool.Ivory or Jaqueline should have won the contest.But if you purchase this video,please.. please.... be careful of Mae Old.I'm warning you."
5,"Finally, A good WWF Pay-Per-View","After the very dismal and awful 1999 pay per views, with the exception of the St. Valentines Day Massacre, Fully Loaded 1999, and Summerslam, the 2000 year started off great! The rumble rocked and was exciting as hell, the wwf championship match was very brutal and very good, the table match was incredible, and the rest was awesome. buy this 1 now!!!!!"
4,Back on the right track,"Before Royal Rumble 2000, I was begining to loose interest in the WWF. Throughout most of 99, the ppv's were pretty boring and preditable. The majority of Royal Rumble was neither boring or predictable. The introduction of Tazz was a great way to start the event. The swimsuit contest was very entertaining and the table match was spectacular. The WWF title match lived up to all of the hype beforehand. It was possibly the most hardcore match that has ever take place in the WWF. The use of thumb tacks and barbed wire is more recognised in an ECW ring. The rumble itself was a bit disappointing. After great rumbles from 97 and 98 it was a bit of a let down. never the less, it did not spoil a great PPV which renewed my interest in wrestling."
5,Good way to kick off the year 2000,here are the year 2000's royal rumble matches. Match 1:Kurt Angle vs. Tazz. Match 2:Table Match:Hardys vs. Dudlys. Match 3:ic title:Hardcore Holly vs. Chyna vs. Jericho. Match 4:tag titles:Outlaws vs. Acolytes. Match 5:street fight for wwf title Triple H vs. Cactus Jack. Match 6:Rumble Match. plus:a bikini contest. NOTES:this was a great ppv. hhh vs. cactus and hardys vs dudlys were both show stealers in the best Rumble ever.
5,Best overall Rumble in years.,"This was the best Royal Rumble in years, and the first of the great PPVs the WWF has put on in 2000. The Royal Rumble match had one of it's best rosters ever, plus it seemed to get back to basics, making the most enjoyable Rumble matches in years. The WWF Title match was one for the ages, with Cactus Jack battling Triple H in a 5 star classic. The Table match was full of action (as all ways with the Hardy Boyz involved), and elevated the Dudley Boyz to Superstardom. Also, The Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly match, and Tazz vs. Kurt Angle match, were short, but were good matches."
4,Royal Rumble 2000 - Great Start for 2000,"I will give you a review of each match and the Special Features on a scale of 1-10.Kurt Angle vs Tazz - 6/10Great opener!!!Tag Team Table Match - 8/10Hardy Boyz vs Dudley BoyzLots of High Risk moves here. Great MatchMiss Rumble Swimsuit Competition - 0/10The Ending was probably the most sickning thing.Triple Threat WWF Intercontinental Championship - 8/10Chris Jericho vs Chyna vs Hardcore HollyGood Match between these SuperstarsWWF Tag Team Championship - 6/10New Age Outlaws vs AcolytesThis match was way too short, but had action.Street Fight WWF Championship - 10/10Triple H vs Cactus JackProbably the best WWF Championship ever.Royal Rumble Match - 5/10Very disappointing Rumble match. We all knew who was gonna winSpecial Features - 7/10Look back at 1998/1999 Rumble MatchesCactus Jack ReturnsThe Rock vs Big Show No Way Out PreviewTriple H gets stitched upDivas in SwimsuitsPretty good Special FeaturesOverall DVD gets a 50/80"
5,Street Fight!!!!,"I loved Royal Rumble! The best match was the street fight Cactus Jack vs. Triple H. If you ever see the movie "" Most Memorable Matches of 2000,"" (....) then get it because it has this match. I also liked the 30 man Royal Rumble because of who won it. My friend Patrick Grasso loved the street fight the best. But I still think that WrestleMania 17 is just a little better than this. Get this movie though!!! It will not be a waste of your money. Trust me. You will like this movie. ...."
4,WWF Royal Rumble 2000 review,"The Taz-Kurt Angle match was nothing more then a one-sided flop. The tag team tables match between The Hardy Boys-The Dudley Boys was a good reminder of the tables matches from the 1990's ECW. The 3 way bout for the IC was a solid bout for a 3 way. The world tag team title match between The New Age Outlaws & the APA was short but sweet. The Miss Rumble swimsuit contest was nothing more then a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"". The Streetfight for the world title between HHH & Cactus Jack(Mick Foley) while not as good as the ""I Quit"" match from the 1999 event,it was still a good reminder of the Japanese hardcore matches. The Royal Rumble match was not great but pretty good. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
4,WWF ROYAL RUMBLE 2000,"THIS WWF PPV WAS AWESOME. THERE WAS ONLY ONE GOOD MATCH THOUGH AND THAT WAS THE STREET FIGHT FOR THE WWF CHAMPIONSHIP BETWEEN TRIPLE H AND CACTUS JACK. TRIPLE H AMAZINGLY CAME OUT ON TOP, BUT HE WAS A BLOODT MESS. THE OTHER FIVE MATCHES WERE NOT THAT GREAT. GET THE WWF ROYAL RUMBLE FOR DVD OR VHS."
5,5 stars for a reason,"One the best WWF pay per veiws of the year 2000!!! With classic matches such as an unbelievable match between the Hardy Boys and The Dudley's, the royal rumble match itself, and one of the greatest WWF championship matches since the HBK days being Cactus Jack vs Triple HHH. this event has it all no let downs and all props, the miss rumble 2000 contest was even worth seeing twice. Definitly recommend!!!!!"
1,the miss royal rumble bikini contest did not need to be in wrestling contains nudity.,1st match kurt angle vs tazz winner tazz 2nd match tag team table match the dudlays vs the hardy boyz winners the hardy boyz. 3rd match terri vs may young vs bb vs the kat vs luna vs ivory vs jacquelne this was just sick to watch winner may young. 4th match chris jerico vs chyna vs hardcore holly winner chris jerico. 5th match noa vs apa winners noa. 6th match triple h vs cactus jack winner triple h. 7th match royal rumble match winner the rock.
1,WWF Fully Loaded,The only good match was the First-Blood End of an Era match between the Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Don't even rent this one.
4,Street Fight,"This has got to be one of the best PPVs this year. Kurt Angle met his fate by facing Tazz, the Street Fight for the WWF Championship, and of course: The Bikini Match! The only bad part is when Mae ""Old"" stripped!"
2,Royal Rumble,I would have given it a 5 star but there isn't going to be the best Royal Rumble without Stone Cold Steve Austin. I HATE THE ROCK A LOT! Stone Cold Steve Austin should be on top and he was on top until The Rock stole his spot when Stone Cold had surgery! This video is great but I would get the 1998-1999 Royal Rumbles! :)
1,extremely annoying,"I wonder if they even tried this out themselves before putting it out there. I started with the ""thighs"" section, and it was lightning speed switching between all sorts of different exercises, a couple of one, a couple of another, like dancing but nobody showing you the steps first. It was extremely annoying. Um, ""For Dummies?"" How about ONE exercise at a time. SHOW how to do it. Then do ALL the reps of that one until it's finished. THEN proceed to do the same with the next one. What is the purpose of mixing and matching them all up? I don't feel like watching it a dozen times through just to be able to follow it. I'd rather throw it in the trash and get one that works for MY convenience instead of needlessly making me do all that. BTW, I am an athletic person to start with, ability to do the exercises is in no way the problem. This was stupid."
3,I must be dumb,If this is for dummies then I am dumb. It is very bland and boring. The instructor routinely changes moves before she says what she is going to do. I found myself constantly trying to guess what was going to come next and then ended with less of a workout because I wasn't following it entirely. I constantly had the wrong arms or legs because she changes up so quickly and without notice. It's too late when your arms are already going up in the air to make then now go down at a seconds notice or to try and follow some seemingly random pattern of alternating moves. I did not like this video for that reason. She could have better explained what she was doing. I guess if you did this often enough then you would know the next move but this is supposed to be for dummies! I am not a novice at exercie and wanted this for the 15 minute workout periods.
5,Great workout video,I love this DVD because you can do a quick 15 minute workout in the morning even if you don't have much time. Then if you do have more time you can do 2 or 3. Exercises aren't too difficult and it does show advanced and more simpler moves. The only thing I don't like about this video is the name. No one is a dummy if they are making an effort to workout!
2,Could be better,"The warm-ups in this video are not for dummies. They are too quick and too complex. I do a Leslie Sansome exercise dvd for my warm-up and skip the warm-ups. It's really good that this dvd is set up so you can do that. The strength training exercises are much easier to follow, but she does not demonstrate a basic version of the exercise until about halfway through. Basic versions are shown only briefly. This would be an excellent dvd if the warm-ups were simplified and the basic versions were demonstrated at the beginning. It would also be better if another person demonstrated the basic version throughout the exercise."
5,Excellent. Loved it.,Great that you can get a full 60 min workout or divide in 15 min segments. Her hints are very helpful when it comes to modifications. My level of fitness (or lack of at this time) does not keep me from being able to follow her or keep up.
2,"Okay, is there a ""Fitness for SUPER Dummies"" workout?","This was recommended to me as a great workout for beginners, but I was totally lost in the first 60 seconds of the warmup! She keeps adding steps without a whole lot of explanation and making it look easy, which seems a bit baffling considering that she's talking to a bunch of people who think they are ""dummies"" at fitness!The ab exercises were WAY too hard! I couldn't even make it halfway through that section. She does give ""basic"" modifications for some exercises, but even the basics were too hard for me.To be fair, I think this program is probably pretty good--and I will keep working on it as I progress in my weight loss program--but if you are are a true sedentary beginner and looking for something to get you started, you might want to try something else first."
3,Dummies? This dummy can't keep up...,"Just getting started this is the 1st video I have tried. Since the word ""dummy"" is in the title I figured even I could manage.However, after using the video 4 times a week for 2 weeks I still cannot keep up with the warm up. And I repeatedly have thought the warm up routine is well beyond any beginning dummy. So, I modify and once she tosses in more steps than I can manage I just do the first couple she teaches repeatedly until she is done with the warm up.The work out portions are much easier to follow and I like the 15 minute time frame-- that is indeed my favorite part. I just remind myself that even I can make it for 15 minutes...So, good time frame, impossible non-dummy warm ups with easy to follow work out portions..."
4,15 Minute Workouts for Dummies,Arrived on time and in good condition. Easy to follow and keep up with. Provides good supplemental information while working out. Gay Gasper is pleasant to follow and inspirational.
4,Good for the price,"This is a great resource for the price. I purchased this just wanting to learn more about music in general. I'm an aspiring singer so I figured why not? There's a lot of helpful information in this book, but the only thing I can say about it is that you can find this information almost anywhere for free...however you have to remember that it's just a reference book meant to check out on the fly while you're at a music lesson or if you don't have access to the internet or a text book or something so it definitely does it's job and works great."
5,A Pocket full of Basics,Exactly what the titles suggests - compact music theory - helped my husband to bring back his music theory from his school days in order to write his music down.
5,Simplified!,"In few words, this book can thoroughly explain some of the most important fundamentals of music composition. I have been searching for a while for a book like this -- this one is great! Cheap and pocket-sized too!"
2,Very Disapointing,This book is too simplistic. Every issue is approached superficially. If you are a beginner with very few knowledge about music theory then this book might be appropriate for you since I have detected no mistakes. Otherwise if you're looking for specifics and depth don't get it...
5,For my Wife,She has been looking all over for this song. Got me some attá boy points for buying it for her.Thanks
4,A Million Dollar Collection for a Million Dollar Voice,"This four CD set chronicles the stellar career of one of the world's greatest singers. Versatility, dymanics, charisma, and charm are qualities of any Connie Francis recording. The importance of including every pre-Who's Sorry Now recording, however, is questionable in the light that many great recordings were not included in this set. Where is Time After Time, and Stardust, and Because Of You? Some rare recordings emerge on this set. Zingara, Born Free,Lonely Again, are among them. As usual, with respect to Connie's box sets, an excellent job was done throughout. This set, more affordable than her other two box sets, will allow any Connie Francis fan many hours of that great signature sound."
2,Disappointing Content,Product arrived in a timely manor and in new condition. I would not buy this product again. Disappointing content.
5,Excellent bargain,"I highly recommend this drum truck. It it very sturdy, built to handle heavy loads. (some of the drums I move weigh over 700 lbs), and at the price it can't be beat!"
2,"Poor sound quality, nullifies any reason to buy","I love Cream, I love most of the songs on this CD -HOWEVER, this CD is poorly remastered (actually it downright ...!). It is unlistenable on heaphones( I'm talking the expensive kind)."
4,"Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton, and ""the other guy""","This single-disc compilation is as near-perfect as you can get to capturing the very essence of Cream. Those who are already fortunate enough to possess all four Cream albums already would still do well to pick up this compilation, as it contains two rare singles, ""Wrapping Paper"" and ""Anyone for Tennis,"" the latter being a catchy little Eric Clapton/Martin Sharp song.While this represents one of the greatest supergroups of all time, it fails to represent a vital anchor to the band's sound: drummer Ginger Baker. Two tracks of the 20-track compilation are songs in which Ginger Baker co-wrote (""Sweet Wine"" and ""Those Were The Days"") and while these songs are excellent, one cannot ignore the sad fact that ""Toad,"" ""Blue Condition,"" and ""Pressed Rat and Warthog"" were virtually ignored here. Granted, these weren't exactly smash hits for the group, but it leaves out a significant part of this amazing group."
3,remaster quality bites!!,I bought this for convenience rather than playing my vinyl copies of Disraeli Gears and Wheels of Fire. Big mistake as the bottom end of the scale is mostly missing. It is difficult to hear Baker work his magic. Keep your vinyl or buy the box set as the remaster quality is apparently better.
2,its O.K.,I bought this when it came out years ago. I thought I would like it for the hits and the extra tracks. A good CD to have in your care. Right? The extra tracks are almost embarassing. The original Albums that were remastered have a lot more sonic boom. Pick those up.
4,Not bad,"They were only together a short time, but they were all heavyweights in classic rock. All the big ones are here except ""Doing the Scrapyard Thing""."
4,Liked the Vinyl Versions Better - But Still Fantastic,"Somehow through the scratches and pops on my 30+ year old vinyl version, the energy and power of Cream comes through better than on this CD digital version. Still, has there ever been a better live guitar rif than 'Crossroads'? No - never. The Best."
1,Dreadful Hard digital sound,This was great disappointment to me. The sound quality was one of the worst transfers I've heard in recent times. This is a great shame because the music is just sooooo good! Lets hope the more recent remasterings are better. (lets face it they just have to be)
5,The Very Best of Cream,"If your a fan of Cream, this is the CD to have! It has 20 great songs for a long time of listening pleasure."
5,Great Cd Classic Band,"As several reviewers have mentioned, Cream wasone ofthe first major super groups. The Members of the group: Jack Bruce on bass andvocals, Eric Clapton on guitar and vocals,and Ginger Baker on drums, had all been in other bands previously. This cd, The Very Best ofCream, is a concise overview of Cream as a band. It contains some of there most famous songs like ""Crossroads"" ""White Room"" ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and ""Strange Brew"" along with some lesser known gems such as ""Born on a Bad Sign.""This cd is packed with great songs, and if you're a fan of 60's rock,guitar rock, or blues rock,this group is for you. I'm a teenager,and I think more of my generation should listen to this group. In there day,they were one of the best super groups out there."
4,An excellent retrospective,"The songs off of ""Fresh Cream"" didn't do too much for me, that's why I'm only giving it a 4 out of 5... but the rest of it is acid-blues-jazz-metal, and psychedelic music at its finest. The chemistry between Clapton, Burce and Baker was volatile, and sometimes turmoiled, but nonetheless it was magical, and shows that you can accomplish a lot in just 2 years."
4,Range of Songs,"The songs were great and easy to learn words to even if you are not a Cream fan by age. My favorites were ""Tale of Brave Ulysses"", ""White room"", and last but not least, ""Crossroads"". The price for this Cd at amazon is so much lower then regular prices. I wish i could have bought my copy from here!"
4,Range of Songs,"The songs were great and easy to learn words to even if you are not a Cream fan by age. My favorites were ""Tale of Brave Ulysses"", ""White room"", and last but not least, ""Crossroads"". The price for this Cd at amazon.com is so much lower then regular prices. I wish i could have bought my copy from here!"
5,Essential listening,"As someone who grew up with Cream, this album is a delight. Eric Clapton has always had the limelight, but to me the true hero of this group was always Ginger Baker. His drumming is like no other then and now (listen to 'we're going wrong' particularly). Jack Bruce was also under-rated, particularly on the live albums. His 6 string base lines can rival Clapton. This album features most of the popular tracks for Cream, with for me none better than 'CrossRoads'. However, 'spoonful', I'm so glad', 'Sitting on top of the world', 'politican' and 'born under a bad sign' highlight the blues roots of Cream and provide the best tracks on the album."
3,Best of Cream,Great CD... however: there were many cuts that could have been left off and would not be missed. I would rather have had Quality than quanity on this CD. This was not the CD I thought it was
4,Damaged case.,"The product came with a cracked CD case, so I did not open and listen to the CD. Also, I erred as well, somehow ending up with the Very Best of Cream, where I actually wanted Disraeli Gears, which contains the song ""Dance The Night Away."" Five stars for a perfectly good album, minus one star for the cracked CD case, which I have returned for a refund."
2,review of LIVE CREAM cd,Ive yet to find any live Cream recordings that are any where near as good as Crossroads and Spoonful on Wheels of Fire. All the other stuff lacks the moral power of experiencing new space. Does anyone out there know of any other recordings that are on the same page ? Regards John Nobbs
2,Poor Sound Quality,"The Very Best Of Cream contains twenty of Cream's hits. You can check the mp3 offer for this CD to see what songs are included. I purchased this CD used so I am not out alot of money. The audio quality of this CD is poor. There is no low end, there is no high end and there is no dynamic range. In my opinion this CD does not qualify as high fidelity. Not worth listening to."
3,"Eh, It's OK...","..Not really that thrilling, I am referring to the whole series. I liked the original series quite a bit but this version did'nt really thrill me as much as some other people, but it is better than most."
4,Characters don't feel the same.,The animation of this BGC is the same (if not better) than the previous one. How ever the characters are not the same. Possibly diferent people were at the helm of the story. None the less the animation is good.
1,Weak Sloppy Art and Poor Writing Insult the Series,"The orginal 8 episode Bubblegum Crisis is a masterpiece of great futuristic anime and one of my all time favorites. The art in this new version 2040 is a total insult to the franchise and looks worse than the Flintstones or Scooby-Doo. I mean you have these monsters that look like a paper cut out with a couple of holes and bolt, and none of the great writing that came with the original. I almost never bash anime but in this case the art is so bad it deserves it. It is like someone just picked up the title to make a quick yen and spent no time, money, or thought on it because they were counting on the fame of the original to sell it. I am sure they made their money because of that but this is truly the worst quality anime I have ever seen, yes, the worst. Don't reward these makers of junk who insult the awesome original Bubblegum Crisis."
4,So starts the legacy,"This first DVD is awesome. I""m a big fan of Bubblegum Crisis and to see it out on DVD is tight. Even though it only shows how the Knight Sabers basically get to gether and interact with on another, it sets up for awesome action packed series...it's easy to get hooked on..I recommend this for anime gurus and beginners"
1,Ah Me Dis,"For your information, I have still not received my order. Granted the 28th of September is the deadline stated.Francis."
5,Great album of classic tunes...,"I bought it for my mother who use to have it when it came out years ago. She was looking for it for years and I'm happy to find it. The recording is great, no issues, sounds awesome on a 5.1 system."
5,A lovely story,"This beautifully illustrated book tells the story of how beavers transform a stream into a pond, and how that transforms the ecological community around it. It's not preachy or seemingly educational, and yet it perfectly teaches what an ecological community is. My daughter has loved this book since she was two, and we come back to it again and again as she approaches age seven. As an adult, I love it enough that we could read it every night until she leaves home and I doubt I'd tire of it."
3,decorations,"I thought that the pieces were bigger than they actually are. Am a bit disappointed but I like them anyway, and would be buying from this seller again!!"
2,Baby Deluxe Review,I needed something very fast for a baby shower and this came in right on time. I had to pay for expedited shipping of course.The product itself was OK. Kids liked it more as the designs were different. The designs didn't look as professional as the ones shown in the pictures but as I mentioned it worked for me as it was so last minute.Thanks
3,"ok, but not great","I ordered these to go on top of cupcakes for a baby shower. When they arrived, several were broken, and the colors were much more neon than I expected.I used them on the cupcakes anyways and they turned out OK, but I am not sure I would have ordered them had I known the colors were so different from the pictures."
5,Fantabulous,I actually ordered these for my sister's baby shower and we live all the way in St. Vincent which is an island in the Caribbean and I was not only impressed with how fast we got them but they were intact. Will definitely order from this company again.
4,Outstanding composition,"If not for the vocals I would give it five star. This album rivals the music of his group Helloween. The vocals reminds me of Bruce Dickinson. Most notable here is the guitar playing of Grapow(sometimes I think he is much more technical than Weikath). The title track ""The Four Season's of Life"" is to my view one of the best neo-classical composition in the genre. Very rich in riffing variation interlaced with neo-classical overtones and the keyboards harmonizes as well.The instrumental track ""Dedicated to..?"" proves that Grapow's technical playing is finely crafted. This album promises neo-classical progression, check this out!!!"
5,A map is a map,"Not much to say here. I needed a specific, street level map dn this one fits the bill."
5,A hauntingly unforgettable story.,"Bravo to Amazon.com for having information on this book. I read it in the early 80s, and have been searching for another copy for years. It is a fast-paced, credible plot. Rarely do I find a book that stays on my mind as this one has. An excellent read if you're lucky enough to find it."
4,"Medical personnel will note the big gaps, no one else will!","Never mind the huge gaps in medical science, this is still an entertaining story filled with minutae that give it life and breath. You will be there in ancient Rome with Eugeni, in greedy corporate America with Lew, in the Socialist mindset with Semyon, and believe it or not, in the cloistered nunnery with Olava. It is an ensemble cast of seemingly impossible common ground, but Sapir makes their conspiracy entirely believable. I re-read this book about once a year, along with Wilbur Smith's ""Sunbird"" and Pat Frank's ""Alas Babylon"". Yep, it's THAT good."
1,Disappointed!!,I was disappointed with this book as an experienced watercolor artist. I am in this field for > 35 years. The author only focused on one form of light and shades. Light and shades are very exciting subjects as we can see in the impressionists' masterpieces. I only found very limited scope of discussions in his book.
1,Not for beginner,I'm a beginner in watercolour. I am not able to apply the techniques taught here.This book can't work by itself. I need some artists to explain to me before I can understand the hiden secrets.I think the writer should edit it and make it more comprehesive rather than showing it like Black Magic.
1,My personal opinion,I bought this book because of its good reviews. But it is just not right for me.Probably it is only suitable for tropical watercolourists. Only one kind of light and shadow effect was mentioned. The scope was too narrow. No much I could gain as a watercolour painter. It didn't fit the word 'Mastering'. But I could understand because many 'so called' masters could not write proper concepts.
2,SpeedyLock--Nightmare,"I have wanted a serger for years and finally got one.The threading guide was helpful, but took forever (about 1 hour)to do. Finally, I was able to use it...but had such difficultywith the tension knobs. It was always either too tight or too loose. The tension control is really hard to operate and hard to get it right.I am returning the machine and going to look for one with automatic tension controls. It will make my life easier. DO not get this machine if you do not want a headache with the tension knobs because it may also ruin your project."
1,Serger for beginners--not!,"I specifically chose this serger because it was advertised for beginners. I didn't want a machine with all the bells and whistles, I had some industrial-type sewing to do, and chose this serger because it was basic and fast. Okay, so it's fast. However, I highly recommend that if you are a beginner, you DON'T buy this machine. I was having so many problems that I attempted to contact customer service/technical support. Haha! Three or four days later I got a response that began, ""Dear Ms Kerr."" I'm not Ms. Kerr. If she's reading this, the answer to her problems is that they're all her fault. The response I got did not address the questions I asked, and merely repeated what was in the rather inadequate manual. Oh, and I discovered the solution to one of the problems was to IGNORE one of the instructions in the ""instructional"" video (which was also very poorly produced). In short, unless you have serger experience and like threading and rethreading don't buy this serger."
1,Horrible Australian Black Metal,Truly one of the absolute worst black metal albums ever. A complete waste of money. The recording is absolutely horrible and it the shrieking is barely listenable. The guys wants to be like Burzum or Xasthur and he doesn't have nearly the talent. Avoid at all costs.
1,PERFORMED BY WHO?,"These songs are NOT performed by the original artists. The vocals are horrible and it's downright embarrassing to listen to it. These guys have no talent, period... - don't buy this CD!"
4,adorable happy lucky cat,I have the green version of this product that my friend got me from Japan when he visited. I absolutely love it. I asked him to get me a maneki neko and this is what he brought back. It is absolutely adorable. The only problem I have with it is it needs very direct light. It doesnt work with just ambient room lighting. It actually needs to sit in sunlight or relatively bright lamp light. But considering it wasnt very expensive for me I dont have a problem with that. It makes me smile to look at it so I think its great!
3,it's not what we thought...,she is a cute as a button but not at all what we thought. she never moves unless you put her in direct sun light....
5,Cat is timeless,"Some music you get sick of, some you can listen to over and over and still find new things. After 25 years of listening to this album, I still find it fresh and wonderful. Cat was a genius and his music will endure. I love the mix of upbeat and mellow on this album. Tuesday's Dead, Bitterblue, If I Laugh, right on down to the overplayed Peace Train are all Cat in his finest period. No serious collector should be without this album."
5,Ride on the Peace Train!,"I bought this album for my mom as a Mothers' Day gift, and I've fallen in love with it myself. But then, I'm a total hippy wannabe. ;)If you enjoy Keith Green's music, you'll enjoy Cat Stevens.If you dream of traveling in a 70's Volkswagen Westfalia Camper, you'll enjoy Cat Stevens.The sound is soft and eager. It's searching, and certain of finding the answer. And you can play it via your CD player!"
1,inauthentic is right,"It's unfortunate that all imported Thai teas seem to have artificial food coloring, and it was a nice idea for Thai Kitchen to try and come up with an all-natural analog. However, this tastes nothing like real Thai tea. They need to take this one back to the test kitchen."
4,Key's best solo effort,"Of Key's 3 solo albums, I like 'The Dragon Experience' the best. Since it's the most ambient of his works, it's the easiest album to listen cover-to-cover. It definitely lacks the trademark gothic edge of the SP stuff from the same period ('Bites', 'Remission', 'Brap'). However, I like the old-school analog, ambient, semi-structured sound on display here. And actually, I find I listen to this disc more than either 'Bites' or 'Remission' or 'Brap'.My favorite songs are 'Running (Back and Forth)', 'Shortwave Connector', 'Skeletal Mask', 'Diagnosis', & 'Maniac Shuffle'.Definitely a must-have for any Skinny Puppy fan, and if you find SP's style interesting, but too abrasive, then check this album out."
4,nice piece,"i've been slowly getting into the skinny puppy genre. i started listening to download and expanded into the cevin key and ogre solo efforts. tons of outstanding music. the dragon experience is no exception. the music is dark and anonymous. killer industrial sounds and tight beats. some tracks lull you into a trance, some awaken a long forgotten dream, others inject you with plasma hot lightning."
3,it's okay,"i like skinny puppy and all the various offshoot releases that are available. this didn't remind me of skinny puppy as other reviewers seem to believe. it doesn't have ""the edge"" of puppy. what i don't like about this release is the tracks are relatively short. with techno/ambient/industrial sounds, you want longer tracks, because just as you start getting into these, the sound is over. as other reviewers state, these are left over tracks, and indeed sound like it. in my opinion, this is not a ""must own"" cd. if you want to get it, check out the used cds."
1,inaccurate and poorly edited,"This review is of a PRIOR EDITION: If you want to be told 'Net Profit' is an expense, see page 31.Check page 5 ""Average cost method. Divide the total number of units of goods available for sale into the average purchase cost for a period of time."" Dividing an average by quantity gives garbage.Be on your toes for this type of carelessness throughout the whole book.A REAL reference book would have an index and a glossary.The US Chamber of Commerce should be ashamed to be associated with this."
3,Not sure if its worth the price???,"As in the title, Im not convinced this was worth the $$. Should be priced about twentyfive dollars less. The sound is not bad for a battery operated piano. However the keys make such a hard plastic clank when pressed that it takes away from the sound (musically) that they should be making. My daughter is 8 months old & seems to enjoy pounding on the keys & watching them light up. However do keep an eye on your little one as this piano tips easily. She will reach (from a sitting position) for the yellow happy face, and when she does get a hold of it, the whole piano topples on her as well. It is not a heavy toy, which is why it can be lifted by an infant. This will definitely not entertain her to the recommended age 3 limit, but it works for now. Just wishing it had cost less."
4,great fun and interactive,"WE bought this toy for our baby girl who is now 5 months old. She loves the music book, of course to chew on. some of the other reviews mention that the sun moves with some songs and fingers get caught. The sun does not move on my piano and I haven't seen any spots where the fingers could get pinched. Even at such a young age my little one loves this, so money well spent. The down fall to this toy is that it tips over if my little one tries to pull herself up, so supervision is needed, it is not heavy so it did not seem to hurt her. If your child cannot stand well, I would wait to put the legs on, because once they are on they are on."
3,Love the idea but the toy has a glitch,"I love this toy and so does my 8 month old son. He especially likes to pull himself up on it to play so you have to be careful that it doesn't tip over. However, the number 4 gets stuck and no matter what key I press the 4 lights up and says blue. Hopefully it's just mine but I don't know what to do about this. I haven't called the company yet."
3,Baby loves it but 2 safety issues!!!,"My 7 month old loves this toy but you definitely have to keep a close eye during use. 2 big safety issues:FIRST - I agree with the review that says: ""The piano is great except for one thing. Little hands get stuck in the slot the sun moves in. The sun moves from side to side during certain songs, and my daughter and her friends love to grab at it when it starts doing this. Inevitably, someone's hand always gets pinched and makes them start crying/screaming."" My wrist was caught in the sun and it pinched it so hard that I got a purple bruise INSTANTLY. I can only imagine how bad it would've been if it were my son and not me!!SECOND - It's not that sturdy and unless it's leaned/propped up against the wall or couch, my 15 pound baby can easily knock it over. It doesn't support much weight."
1,Pinching hazard!,"This toy is a pinching hazard. The sun's hands pinched my daughter's armpit skin quite badly leaving bruises(and quite a few tears). She was playing with it on a hot day, dressed only in her diaper, when she leaned over the sun bit to hit the keys from behind. The sun's hands moved and caught a bit of her armpit and tummy skin. Such howls! (And how can blame the poor little thing?) This toy is not safe!!!I see another reviewer has also mentioned the pinching hazard. Very disappointed that Fisher Price's standards are no longer what they once were."
4,We like it....but stay within hands reach with younger babies,"My daughter just received this baby grand piano from her grandparents as a baptism present. She is 10 months old and really seems to like it. The piano does so many things and I forsee her having a lot of fun with it and am happy that I suggested it for a present. The reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that my daughter, who is just learning to stand and cruise, stood up with the piano and she must of put to much weight towards the middle of the piano, while I was reaching for the camera, because the piano tobbled end over end with her following it. The piano started to do the same thing right after that when she tried to stand. She wasn't hurt, more scared then anything, but I would have thought it would be sturdy enough to handle her putting a little weight in the middle of it. I still recommend the piano, but stay within hands reach if your baby can't walk and keep themselves fairly steady on their own."
3,"Fun toy, but tips over easily","My 8 month old twins love playing with this, I just wish they would learn to share it! My son pulls up on it, and a few times has pulled it over on him, that it the only reason I gave it 3 stars. Otherwise it holds their attention for a long time, and they love banging on it and ""singing"" along."
1,Would have been GREAT... if it had worked.,"I was SO excited when my aunt bought this toy for my two year old daughter. I had been looking at it for a year, and it looked so adorable. When we got it, she loved it. We played with it for about a week, and it was awesome. She loved the lights and music, and I loved that it had actual pitches as well as pre-programmed songs and activities. Within a week it stopped working; I was hoping it was just the batteries, but all sound stopped short, so I feared it wasn't. I changed the batteries but it didn't help. In looking into replacement options, the cost of shipping was prohibitive, so we never got it fixed, and they are too expensive just to replace. So there it is. It won't make a peep, not even a flicker of a light. I have an adult keyboard and she likes to play on that, so I'm glad she still has a way to experiment with music, but I (and my aunt) were SO disappointed that her own little baby piano quit working."
4,Entertaining Piano,"Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers 1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.We don't have a problem with her pinching her hands yet and she has played with it everyday for almost 4 months (it is her favorite toy).I give this piano four stars because the sharps and flats (black keys on a piano) don't work."
4,Great product could use some improvement,"Our twins love it. The songs and tunes are great. They dance to it when they move it around. I would only wish it had at least a two setting volume control. Also, the kids can easily tip it over. In fact, they like to slide it around as they crawl and then tip it over. I'd recommend it to others nonetheless."
4,my son loves this.,my 5-month old son has discovered that he can play the piano with his feet. he loves it. so after that beating i'd say its durable. and i learned how to play row row row your boat on it.
2,"Awesome toy, when it worked.","I had gotten this toy back in 2008, I'm only writing this review to see if it's possible this toy has been improved since. I had received it on Amazon in 2008 (my grandfather sent it) and within a month the blue keys and lights stopped working. So I had it exchanged only the have the same thing happen a second time after two months. The third time it did it all over again so I gave up on it and sold it at a yard sale. Our daughter absolutely adored this and played it very very often. She kept playing with it even after broken, since the rest of it did. However the songs would stop the minute it ""hits"" blue keys, after a while she got annoyed. Now I'm pregnant with our second and this toy keeps ""haunting"" us. We'd really like to get it again, but is it really better after several years??"
4,"Love it, but it does pinch little fingers!","MY 10-month old loves this toy and plays with it everyday; however, We have the same issue with fingers being pinched. When your child grabs onto the sun's face or hands their fingers get pinched in the openings as the parts move. Keep an eye on this, as it pinches very hard. I placed my hand over the opening myself to feel how hard it pinches and it even hurts an adult's fingers."
2,Broken within days,We purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and within days it began to malfunction. For some reason the blue keys do not work. Even if it's just playing a song it will get to the notes that are the blue keys and just stop. Now it's just taking up space in my house.I gave it 2 stars because for the couple days it worked my daughter loved it.
5,Awesome!!,"I bought this for my niece for her first birthday.. (last May) and she still loves it.. It keeps her busy and she loves music so any toy that makes music catch her attention first!This is the only piano toy available online and I wanted one because my sister(nieces mum, ofcourse) loved her piano when she was little and I just wanted to continue the legacy with her daughter.. :)I would recommend this for my friends and family!"
5,Grandma JJO,I have 4 grandchildren and three of them just love this toy. The music it plays it delightful! I had trouble sorting out the various functions but it seems that my little 1 year old grandson has no trouble making it work. My 4th grandchild is brand new but I intend to have this toy deliverd to him on his 1st birthday.
5,Buy It,"I purchased this for my 16 month old granddaughter, She loves it. We love it, It sounds great and has several educational features. I see her using it for a long time. Glad I made the purchase."
4,Favorite Toy,"This is my daughter's favorite toy. We purchased it when she was 9 months old and she is now 16 months. It was the first toy that held her attention for more than a minute or two. It was also the first toy she could play with standing. Having a background in music myself, I appreciate the extent to which this toy teaches music. My only reservations about this toy are the sturdiness and the price. It has been durable enough for my toddler, but I wish it was another inch or two higher and the legs were slightly more substantial. That said, it has never tipped or fallen on my child. Overall, a great buy, and a must-have if you can find a good price!"
5,Best toy purchase for the price.,"We bought this for our son at 9 months and it was a hit from the start. He's now 15 months and it is still one of his all time favorites. It occurred to me just now when I saw him go to it AGAIN that we are as entertained by it as he is and that the novelty of it has never worn off. I've recommended it to several moms and grandmothers. I think it will continue to be a favorite for a long time. And the price is slightly higher than a lot of infant toys, but it's well worth it."
4,On the whole...good,"On the whole this was an interesting and accurate description of one of the most important battles in history. I especially liked the telling of how this event helped unite the various city states of Greece, the country that planted the seed of democracy.I only wish the film maker had shown us the actual site today, rather than giving us just maps and computer graphics. It would have been helpful to see just how side the space was between the mountain cliffs and the sea--also that trail around the heights. Since I will never be able to go there, this would have given me a better idea of just what the Spartans and Persians faced.There was considerable repetition of information, as this was apparently made for television with all its commercials and the lack of attention span, as opposed to those who see the DVD in one fell swoop.Nonetheless, I would recommend this as an interesting and important depiction of history."
4,Better than a movie,The documentary was a well developed work on an old subject.The addition of the sea battle is a well mentioned fact that escapes most presentations of this historical event. This is a splendid addition to any historian library.
3,not the Graphic novel,"want the original story, watch this. Goes into the actual events. which are way better then the graphic novel adaptation movie"
3,It was interesting...,"This was an interesting movie and a good supplement to the 300 movie. However after seeing 300 the fight scenes and overall mood of the film was unbelievably cheesy. If was extremely repetitive as well. If you loved 300 and need something to explain the timeperiod, battle, and fill in the holes check it out."
5,Thermopylae!,"If you are interested in this battle, buy it! This past summer I visited Greece and made a point to visit the ""battlefield."" One does not expect something along the lines of preservation of American Civil War Battlefields like Gettysburg or Antietam. The sea has receded a few miles, a delta with many farms and a 4 lane highway now go through the former waterfront where the Battle took place. There are a couple of statues, a frieze and a few maps on the other side of the road, (which would have been under water at the time of the battle, the map helpfully notes)and Kolonos Hill where the last of the Spartans were cut down on the other. This DVD, using photos, computer generated graphics and fascinating commentary by experts, is invaluable to understanding the battle, why it was fought in the first place, and its pivotal place in not just Greek but world history."
4,May Ease Some Torment!,"As a high school history teacher, I have been endlessly tormented by my students to show the movie ""300"". Coming from a highly conservative school district and an administrator who is beyond cowardly, that never was going to happen. So as a compromise I used this DVD as a ""treat"" yet still with some academic value. Overall, it had a moderate amount of interest for my students who enjoyed the maps and animation as well as the actors portraying the various historical figures. The biggest problem was--in a typical multi-cultural classroom--having white, older, male talking heads constantly break into the ""story"" to add their erudite ""two-cents"" completely turned my students off until the next sequence. Showing these gentlemen once, would have been sufficient to provide the historical credentials. Bringing them back every 6-10 minutes allowed too many interruptions to focus lower to mid-level students successfully on the topic."
3,An OK documentary but there is a huge omission,This is a good introduction to the battle of Thermopylae and the Spartan military system in general. You'll have a good basic knowledge of these events after watching this DVD. There are some minor inaccuracies in the documentary but they aren't significant. My problem with this DVD is that the 700 warriors of Thespiae who stayed to the very end with the Spartans don't rate a mention. Thespiae is a part of Boeotia in central Greece. It lost every male citizen at Thermopylae compared with Spartan's 4%. The Persians destroyed Thespiae for good measure. Citizens of Thespiae weren't trained in an agoge type system where military skill is honed or indoctrinated since childhood. Because of that I think they were much braver than the 300 Spartans. History has pretty much forgotten them and it's time a book or documentary deal with these brave men in some depth.
5,This DVD is only for a few groups of people...,"This DVD is for:-AP World History students-College students in an History class, but who are not History majors-People who loved the film 300 and want to know how much of it was based on reality-Folks who love history and want soak it up any way they canThis DVD is not for:-Historians of the ancient world-Graduate students-Spartan scholarsI mean look, this is a program put out by a cable channel with a goal of entertaining the masses and making money. For what it's worth - they've done a good job with this. There are some things that will certainly make an expert throw the remote at the TV, but I am much more PLEASED that they've created something that anyone can watch and maybe learn about a topic that they hadn't even heard of before.HISTORY channel programs are not meant to be the final say on anything - they jumped that shark a long time ago. Instead, they make History alive for folks who may not have cared before."
1,a reader,"Please don't buy this book unless you are comfortable reading vague plans and are an experienced carpenter. For all the other ""Weekenders"" like me who appreciate step-by-step instruction with diagrams/pictures, detailed information on techniques for their projects, discussion regarding suitable materials and tips on finishing the project (i.e. painting, etc.) PLEASE choose a book more suited to your skill level. ... I sense impending doom if I attempt to build his cover playhouse which, by the way, seems rather small at only 6'x6'. I think I will join the ranks and order Norm Abrams plans and video as well. DONT BUY THIS BOOK"
2,OK Book,"It would be nice if the book had more wooden houses to choose from. We are interested in a playhouse, such as the cover of the book. The cover is why I bought it. We already have a play structure. I would have liked to look at a book with just playhouses. This book goes into lots of different structures, that were simply no interest to us. Felt like this book was a waste of money for us."
5,You can build.,"Clear, concise and well illutrated. I bought this book to use as a point of departure/inspiration to build a playhouse. The authors have done a great job on all thier carpentry/design books."
4,Playhouse plans,"Found a playhouse design for my grand daughters yard. With some modifications to the design I built it in sections so it could be transported 150 miles and then set up. It is solid, definitly going to be there for awhile and she loves it. Turned out very cute, but warning an adult does fit in there but its tight.Still fun."
5,You can get better with age,"As a fan of Denise Austin's I had to purchase her latest book, Fit and Fabulous After 40 and I was very impressed with her book. I knew it would be good since Densie wrote it. It's so refreshing to have someone teaching realistic and sensible approaches to having and keeping good health. She is my favorite fitness expert and one reason for that is she's believable and real not some Hollywood star who doesn't have the knowledge and dedication that Denise has. I'm still in the process of reading her book and am enjoying every minute of it. I highly recommend it for anyone who really does want to be Fit and Fabulous After 40.Yours in fitness, Linda Snyder"
2,I was unimpressed,"I had high hopes for this book. All the material in it is very basic and mostly already known. It boasts a 28 day plan but gives everything piecemeal. By the time you get to the days plans, all it is is 7 days of menu plans. For everything else you have to search through the chapters."
3,Denise hasn't changed in years--turn back what?,"While Denise's book is filled with good advice, I couldn't get the following question out of my mind...When has this women NOT been perfect? Where is the evidence that what she professes will ""turn back the clock""? As I see it, her clock has simply not moved. That in and of itself makes certainly for healthy living, but I question if it will help erase or turn back years of unhealthy living for others. She is 44 years old (born in 1957?) and looks great. She is an example of what fitness can do for a person...if they follow it from youth...that does not describe me nor the real life that I have led."
2,Don't bother,"A lot of the nutritional information is outdated. It promises to be different, but is just more of the same old useless information."
5,Fit and Fabulous After 40,I just recently purchased Fit and Fabulous after 40 by Denise Austin from you and I have read about half of the book so far. I love Denise and therefore I love this book. I also have Lose Those last 10 lbs and Jumpstart. She is an inspiration to me and many others out there. I look forward to her next book and I am so happy that I was able to purchase this one from Amazon.com and I received it so promptly from you. Thank you so much.
4,Good buy,"This book is PACKED with information and stories of Americans and their struggle for immigration, while I feel that the book is too cramped (someitmes just too much information, and he tries to repeat his points several times) its because he's trying to drill the problem into our heads. A lot of information for a good price, and really opens your eyes."
4,ANALYSIS AND REFORMATION,"He is doing the work that we pay our elected politicians to do. Ours is not a government by politicians for politicians. Most of them are out of touch with the new reformative spirit of our times; as they will painfully learn rather shortly: that our ""government by the people"" really is ""for the people"". His clear analysis of the invasive ILLEGAL ALIENS is a vital step towards a permanent solution to a permanent threat. Predictably, patriophobes and racist-baiters will attack him ideologically."
5,A great deck!,"this was the second deck i bought. this is an amazing deck, not only is it eye candy it is an amazing and acurate deck, i recomend this to anyone who collects, is a newbie, or a long time reader!"
2,Not exciting...reads like a text book,"Purchased by accident as gift (got confused scanning all the War of 1812 books). My husband said it was not an exciting book, ""It reads like a text book"". History can and should be exciting and so should the telling of it. I disliked History throughout school, (dry text books), until after college when I started reading History for pleasure.P.S. Still can't find the book I wanted to buy."
4,Stereo Action,This is an interesting orchestral Stereo action recording. There are lots of strings. If your taste is more to horns I recommend Latin Esque or my favorite Futura by Bennie Green. There are some chorus sections on this recording that are a bit like Bob Thompson's MMM Nice. I would say if you really like stereo action buy this but get the Esquivel and Green first.
1,GREAT FIASCO !!!!,"Hello audiophile friends:Yes, this copy is a great fIASCO because the recording is in MONO SOUND, the STEREO ACTION is lost, the SOUND YOU CAN FOLLOW is Lost, and the Dynamica between the speakers of course is Lost Too. I writed to RCA in Spain presenting a claim because in the front cover of my copy they say "" STEREO ACTION "" and not MONO sound, BUT THEY NEVER ANSWER ME .If you buy this CDs. note that maybe don't is that you wait of it.Fercito( From Monterrey, México)"
5,Track List,"1. Gavin Leggit~~~ 2. East End, West End~~~ 3. Her Majesty~~~ 4. Reach Out, I'll be There~~~ 5. I'm Gonna Tell on You~~~ 6. Spare Changes~~~ 7. Big Oak Raisin~~~8. Reggae Funk~~~ 9.

3,Easy Going Fare,Fairly standard Uncle Terry. The second Doctor meets Napoleon and has a rollicking adventure. We've been there before several times. However sometimes you just need a bit of fun.
4,An Interesting Read,"Although I found it a bit hard to stay focused while reading ""The Way of Duty,"" I did like the book. Unlike textbooks that provide facts, charts, graphs and statistics, ""The Way of Duty"" gives the reader a look at what life was like for the Fish family during the Revolutionary War. The reader gets an inside look at childhood, education, religious devotion, the obstacles surrounding marriage, home life for a woman, ideas about death, childbirth, and war. It is excellent when blended with readings from textbooks that deal with the same subject matter."
1,A disappointment,"Not a difficult story to follow, staying alert will require a great deal of effort. Sudden impacts come off key and unceremoniously. Maybe a rainy day with nothing to do book."
5,Vasco's book serves as inspiration for modelers,"For my money, this title provides excellent inspiration for the modeling enthusiast. There are a wealth of high quality airbrushed profiles (after all, that's how the book defines itself), and each is backed up with a photograph or two that allows the modeler to compare and come to his or her own conclusions. I find myself picking up the book frequently for ideas and inspiration. As for the criticism made about the lack of color descriptions, I think most people interested in this title (Modelers, Luftwaffe enthusiasts) will already be well versed in the basic colors used on German fighters. In sum, this book fills a void by providing lots of well thought out interpretations for the Messerschmitt Bf.110. However, if you want detailed specs on Bf.110 variants, this is not the reference for you."
3,The Messerschmitt Bf 110 in Color Profile 1939-1945; a modeller's comments.,"Typical of Schiffer Military History books, the book is produced well, high quality is reflected in almost every aspect. However, the potential buyer should be aware that the book is EXACTLY what it claims to be, color profiles. There is not a single reference to any other angle, no top or bottom views at all. For a modeller this limits the usefulness of the book. However an even greater problem limits the book as RLM colors are not called out and the color profiles are described in poorly defined 'shades of gray'."
5,Sensemaya - Music Of Silvestre Revueltas,"Arrived quickly and unused - great service. The music is unusual and evocative. Based on the review of the performance of this piece by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, I think I expected something more melodious, but as a soundtrack to a film, it would have been incredible music."
2,Sorry to say.....,This book was not what I expected. It is mostly hotels and how to get married in Italy . Was very disappointed.
1,NOT AS EXPECTED,I FEEL THE TITLE IS MISLEADING. I WAS EXPECTING STORIES OF FAMILIES WHO HAVE SOMEONE IN JAIL. IT DIDNT HAVE ANY! IT MOSTLY DEALT WITH A RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF HOW TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.
1,DON'T BUY THIS TELEVISION!!!,"I bought this model in late June of 2004 at Best Buy in Seattle for around $600.00 - It's now January and the TV is broken....just doesn't have a picture. The ""parts"" are covered under warranty but it does NOT cover labor and every TV repair place is charging me $100 bucks an hour to fix. I'm going to end up paying at least a 1,000 for this. I've called Panasonic, I've called Best Buy and I pretty much get a ""too bad"" attitude. Plus, from the consumer websites, I've been on...I""m not the only one. Consider this a warning!!!"
1,I should have bought a Sony,"My complaint is the same as everyone else's. I have had my TV for less than 6 months. All of sudden; no picture! Sometime's it will turn on, but most of the time nothing. If I unplug it for a few minutes, than plug is back in, it works until I turn it off again. I will NEVER buy Panasonic products again. The Sony 27 HD would have cost me an extra $200, but at least I would still have a functional TV."
1,Class Action Lawsuit,I too have experianced the total black out most everyone else has. I'm so disappointed in Panasonic right now. I want my money back.Jerks
1,Another unsatisfied owner,"We bought this TV a few years ago, and we were very happy with it. However, one morning it just stopped working. We don't watch a lot of TV so it has not had a lot of wear and tear. It should have lasted longer than it did."
2,Still ticking and picture looks good but am very displeased,"I'll start by listing the good. The picture quality is great and the tv looks crisp while it's functioning in 480p which is the norm. Can't complain much about TV quality.The bad:This TV doesn't work with ANYTHING over 480p, although it is listed as HDTV ready. I thought it was my equipment but it was not. Now my warranty is way over and I can't do anything about it. THE TV WILL NOT WORK WITH ANYTHING THAT IS HDTV THAT I HOOK IT UP TO. I don't see a fix. I remember talking to Panasonic about it to no avail. This has angerred me enough to write my first review ever on a website. This TV can go to hell, I spent $550 FOR an HDTV ready and didn't get it."
1,This flimsy piece of !@#$@ broke after < 2 years,"Mine broke, too. Anyone having luck complaining? I'm not playing the warranty game b/c that's its own pit of wasted time and effort. Any company that turns out this kind of junk should embarassed."
1,A Waste of Money!!,"Ours, too, went black one month and one year after purchase. What a rip off! I will definitely not buy a Panasonic again. My Magnavox has lasted for years."
1,"Same ""no picture"" problem that others are having","When this TV works, it is great. Mine is 16 months old. Last night I turned the TV on and there was no picture, just a black screen. The sound worked fine. I could not bring up any of the settings menus either. I unplugged the set and let it sit over night. This morning I plugged it in and there is still no picture. The red light on the front is solid (no blinking). I did a search on the internet and this seems to be a common problem with this model. I have contacted Panasonic but have not heard back from them. From other's experience, I doubt that I will. Add Panasonic to the list of electronics that I will not buy again."
1,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!!,"Just like a previous reviewer, my TV lost its picture about five months after I bought it. The parts are covered, but I'm having to shell out big bucks for labor at a TV repair shop. I guess I should have have done some more research, but the low price for an HDTV attracted me. I just checked the Better Business Bureau website to file a complaint against Panasonic, only to find out they already have an UNSATISFACTORY rating!!! Unbelievable. Sony and Samsung have good ratings. I should have paid a little more and bought one of their models. Don't make the same mistake I did! Stay away from this TV!"
5,Ani Takes a Real Journey,"I've just finished reading Different Flags by Eugenia Renskoff. It's the story of a young woman who's very eager to leave home and find herself. At the beginning of the novel Ani is in California. When she gets a telegram saying that her Uncle Juan has died in Argentina, Ani buys herself a one-way ticket To Buenos Aires. After she gets to Argentina, Ani comforts her Aunt Esther and falls in love with the handsome parish priest. But, this is not just a Forbidden Love novel. It goes beyond that to show how Ani changes and becomes an adult instead of the spectator she was for most of her life. In Different Flags Ani acts, feels and wants to achieve goals. She tries hard and she makes mistakes.I really recommend this novel. It's a story I was able to relate to, and I think many women will feel the same way."
4,Most Informative and Interesting Vision of Life in Argentina,"I enjoyed reading Different Flags. The story and events thoughout the book were most interesting and informative to one who has never lived in Buenos Aires. I liked the descriptions of the characters, the story teller, her Aunt and the Priest and the neighbors. The development of their relationship and interaction with each other was skillfully done. At times I had a real vision of their home, their neighborhood and daily routines. The only criticism I have with the book is the syntax. Some of the sentences end with a preposition. Perhaps the author meant to show us how the characters would talk if this were real life. My sister has also enjoyed Different Flags, and we just passed it on to another friend."
1,Strange tale -,"Ani goes to Argentina and meets a priest. She meets a priest and falls in love. The priest remains true to his vows. Ani goes home mad. Thats the story -No need to waste your time or money on this poorly plotted, clunky and inelegant novel. Other authors have done this plot before, and with infinitely more subltey and intelligence. While it is an old story - it is certainly current and might have a chance with good editing."
2,Haven't I read this before?,"I HAD to read this book as a part of this online romance-writers curriculum. Quite frankly, I'm really not sure why. It was hard to get into. Oh, the whole Argentina thing was interesting, but being in love with a Priest? Wasn't that a movie?"
4,Resigning to Fatalism,"When god enters into one's belief system it becomes self evident that His will dominates our own leaving us with a suubordinate vision. Ani's object of affection is forbbiden by Society, her dear aunt, and most of all herself leaving her wanting and predestined to fail. In reading DF one wonders if Ani's situation resembles our own. Perhaps where there is a will there is a way. A very good read for those who struggle with free will"
4,A Simple and Touching Story,"Different Flags is a thoroughly enjoyable, simply told story of a young Argentine -American woman trying to find her place in the world. At the same time, she makes time to help her elderly aunt through an eviction from her long-time home, and she finds herself drawn to the enigmatic Padre Luis. When reading this very visual and touching story, I realized Different Flags, in the right hands, would make a great movie. Is Hollywood listening?"
4,An Argentine version of Forbidden Love,"Recently, my friends passed this novel on to me. Read Different Flags, they told me, you'll like it. And so I did. I liked Ani the young voice of this story, her aunt Esther and their neighbors. I even liked the priest, even if maybe I wasn't supposed to. The scenes telling about life in Argentina and the way the characters are presented are well done. They give the reader more than a taste of armchair travel, and I enjoyed being taken around Buenos Aires. One thing I would have liked is less prepositions. But, I'd read this book again."
4,A very interesting book about forbidden love,"It was a pleasure to read such an interesting story about Ani, a young american woman. Her life is going nowhere and finds in another country (Argentina) the love of her life... a young priest.Ani adapts to this new country and to her new life, far from her family and from the principles of the religion that was given to her when she was born.While I was reading Different Flags, I felt identified with the protagonist, the author describes feelings with beautiful and sensitive emotion."
1,:::snore:::,"This one has been done - by Colleen McCullough - and in far fairer fashion. Not only is the plot predictable, but the grammatical structure is questionable. We're using our copy to prop up the air conditioner."
1,Could have been 5 stars....,"I'm very disappointed in the shipping methods of this supplier. I bought $12.95 worth of lime leaves that are now worthless due to inadequate packaging. The item arrived via priority mail, and was wrapped in brown paper that was sopping wet. Upon unwrapping, the gel coolant pack they placed on top of my produce had leaked everywhere. To make matters worse, the leaves themselves were simply lain on a styrofoam tray with saran wrap around them! They were not even sealed! So now not only is there stickl gel all over my hands, it is all over my lime leaves.Good idea to provide this item, but terrible packaging, bad enough to prevent me from ordering from them again."
5,"A brooding, nightmarish chiller!","This is the best of the Black Oak series so far. A vacation turns into a nightmare for Ethan Proctor and his co-workers. During a cold, dark, and stormy visit to the Atlantic City boardwalk, a chilling (not only weather related) series of events begin to unfold. This book had me totally spellbound from beginning to end. The characters work well together and the addition of a new character was a real plus. I felt the fear of the victims down to my toes. And wanted to see the nemisis, shall we say neutralized, as badly as the characters. A good read indeed!"
3,Too many ancillory characters,"The Black Oak series is arguably the best thing going in the Sci-Fi/Horror genre. Charles Grant, while he's not on the same level as the genre's leading man, Peter Straub, whose complexity and style is second-to-none, is one of the most overlooked writers on the market.Grant has undertaken SEVERAL serial novel endeavors, some under his pen names Lionel Fenn and Geoffrey Marsh (good luck finding them, though. Those books are long out of print). But Black Oak has been mucho fun since its launch two summers ago.The first two installments were worthy, but last fall's ""Winter Knight"" (#3) was clearly the most exhilirating.The Black Oak series, though, is about Ethan Proctor, and Grant spends too much time on secondary characters in ""Hunting Ground.""Proctor is no Dupin, but he is the heart of the chronicle.Hopefully Grant begins to tie all this together, as ""Hunting Ground"" is the 4th installment in the series."
2,Do not waste your money.,"If you read Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, then you know Livermore's rules. As for the secret trading method (Smitten calls Pivotal Point Trading).... it boils down to trendlines. That is it. The book is so similar to the books of William ONeill I was expecting an IBD subscription card to fall out: 1. Watch the top industry groups for market signals. 2. Watch the top two stocks in each market group. 3. Cut losses at 10% (IBD is 8%). 4. Watch for volume to be up at least 50%. 5. Do not average down. 6. Buy on breakouts to new highs. etc, etc, etc."
3,its just like the books by smitten,i have read all of richard smittens books about jesse livermore. they are all very much the same. they have identical passages in different order. the trade like jesse livermore i reckon is the best or 2nd best after how to trade in stocks - due to the flow/order. i reckon first read reminiscences of a stock operator and then one of richards smittens books. richards smittens books is also about 60% repititive to reminiscences of a stock operator which i think is okay
3,good book but falls short on explaining the Pivot Trading,I mean either Smitten does not get it himself or he just plain does not want you to know....A good book on the rest and the phsychology....
2,Odd flavor...,"This tea has a nice aroma, but, it had a 'soapy' taste...I'm used to drinking Chinese Green Tea, so maybe, that's why I find the Jasmine Tea distasteful."
1,Too bitter for my taste,"Since I have been to Asia, I consider myself pretty picky when it comes to tea. A co-worker of mine gave me some of this tea and I find it be extremely bitter. I never add sugar to my tea, but with good quality green tea, it still shouldn't taste like this tea does. I will finish the box so it doesn't go to waste, but I definitely wouldn't buy this tea in the future."
5,Excellent resource for parents and teachers.,"This book is a classic. It is a very good ""how to"" book for teachers. It is full of practical information and examples that teachers can use in their classroom. It is an excellent book for parents to use to advocate for gifted education with their teachers and in their school districts. The techniques are very low cost and easy to understand. A must read and must have!"
5,Should be on every teacher's desk!,"Full of practical, reproducible material for teachers of gifted kids. Lots of advice and ideas regarding common gifted curriculum strategies like compacting, learning contracts, differentiation, independent study, and cluster grouping. Directly answers questions teachers (and parents) of the gifted ask most. Highly recommended... a great resource!"
5,G/T Teacher appreciates this book,I'm a G/T pull out teacher at a small school and I have really enjoyed the tools this book offers. I needed a way to have my identified kids served both with me in pull out and in the regular ed classroom. This has really helped.:)
2,Not a lot of material and very thin.,"As a teacher in a regular classroom, I wanted some differentiated materials aimed at my GATE kids. My aim was to look and find out how to differentiate my lesson plans so that these gate kids can utilize their higher level skills. Maybe even take a normal lesson and extend it, fun things, and puzzles. However, the substance in the book was very sparse and I was thoroughly disappointed."
5,5+ great modem! Works with OSX!,"After searching for usb v92 modems that works with Mac 10.3 I stumbled on this one. I contacted the company, and they quickly responded that it works with my system. So I reluctantly ordered the modem, not thinking it would work. Not only did it work, but OSX detected the modem, and did most of the set up for me!Also, the v92 standard is giving me noticable faster surfing on pages. Not blazing fast, but faster.Highly recommend this modem!"
1,junk,my antique 14.00 dollar internal modem has faster speeds. i checked with two different web sites that check modem speed--c- net was one of them. the internal was a lot faster in both cases.all setings were checked on the external. they were set to the max.
4,olddog,"Bought it for my wife. Good quality. Get the ""long"" size even for a person 5 ft 5 inces tall or taller. I got the reg, and it's almost too short for her - better a little longer, especially with these mummy bags."
5,AWSOME BOOK!!!,Paw Valley is one of the best books I've ever read! I can't wait for the next book so we can find out what happens to Sprinkle. I hope every kid in the world gets to read this book!
5,The best book for childen 7-16 I have seen yet,I read this book the first day I got it. I loved every second that I spent reading it. If you are looking for a book to read to your children or just to read a good fantisy book this is the book to buy. I read a lot of good books that aren't ment for my age group because supposeble the words are too hard. I don't usually like books for my age group but this is one of the few exeptions to my rule. I loved it
3,This was my first Python book,"Not too bad. It helped me develop my sense of what Python is about and I appreciate it for that. It has some good examples of the extensive class library.I was a little disappointed in its treatment of the language fundamentals (it took me ages to find something that described ""__main__""). This isn't the book to really get a grip on the structure of the language itself."
1,"DON""T YOU DARE BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is a waste of money!Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground is of course taken from WHite Blood Cells, which by the way now comes with a DVD. The other two songs are not rarities which you are led to believe here.Suzy Lee and the Robert Johnson cover Stop Breakin Down are from the original White Stripes album which does exist! It was released the day Fell In Love With A Girl was a hit.DON'T BUY THIS! THE EXTRA TRACKS ARE ON THE ORIGINAL WHITE STRIPES SELF-TITLED ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,takes a lickin,"I have service with t-mobile and upgraded from a nokia to this phone. I have unknowingly put it in a cupholder filled with water for about 1/2 an hour. Let it dry for a few months and it turned on. I have dropped this phone a million times, still works. The only problem I have ever had with it, is changing ringtones. Sometimes after I have exited out of the ringtone screen, the song i have last selected plays until finished. Probably from all the times I have dropped it. I will never get rid of this phone!!"
3,What did you say?!!?!?! Huh?!?!?!,"The phones hard to hear out of, and the casing is flimsy.It's extra features are nice... but the two problems with the phone are too key to ignore. This phone has convinced me never to buy a motorola phone again."
1,Piece of crap!,"Stopped working in then the first month. When they unlocked, they must have done something to the OS on it, since it first started having problems (flashing screen etc) and then ultimately died! :(DONT BUY!"
2,Enough to make me switch to a different brand,"This phone has been nothing but trouble. When it works, which is not often, its great. The rest of the time it drops calls like crazy. I have already sent it to the factory once to have it repaired. I have to constantly turn it off and on to get it to recognize the nearest tower. I am getting a new phone soon and am looking forward to running over this one with my truck."
2,I'll try a different brand in the future,"Reception is terrible, droped calls, failed calls, callers can't hear each other, and something is always breaking. We got 4 of these on a family plan. During the 1 year warrante period we exchanged three of them multiple times each for various reasons (backlight died, reception worse than even on the other v600s, unable to hang up calls, camera broke, entire phone just died,...). Now that the warrante is up and we have a year to go on the plan we're stuck."
5,GREAT book for the lay reader!!,"Thank you, thank you, Dr. London, for your well- and clearly-written book, explaining your economics theory in an informative, entertaining and highly readable fashion! It was fascinating to learn how the Wal-Marts and Toyotas of the world reinvented their respective industries, and how free trade and deregulation help to provide better consumer products. I'm a fan!!Sincerely,Sally Haver"
5,Great dj film,This is a classic inside look at some of the world's best DJ's. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a dj.
3,Buy it for 3 songs...,"Cold War, Double Life, and Just Get Through This Night are simply great Styx. Mr. Roboto and Haven't We Been Here before are decent too, but more on the sappy side. Uneven album, but has some gems hidden in the cheese. :)"
2,What were they thinking?,"This was somewhat enjoyable when it came out in 1984. The biggest problem this album has now is that it simply doesn't age well at all. Dennis DeYoung's writing was really starting to feel like a bad Andrew Lloyd Weber musical. Is that redundant? Was it intentional?Buy this if you are completing your collection but Styx needed to break up after this. Of course, their regroup came too late to recapture this fan."
2,Heavens To Murgatroyd!!,"This is the low point of Styx's career. ""Mr Roboto"" has found a new audience years later as a ""Dance Dance Revolution"" song, but it's really a very poor effort; None of the songs on this album are particularly interesting, and it all seems forced and labored; maybe that's owing to the division of effort between the album and the related film shown at the concerts on the tour of 1983. Whatever the reason, Styx disintegrated after this tour, reuniting briefly in 1990 and then separating for almost 10 more years after that. It's a sin to me still that such a great band ended its heyday with an album as weak as this."
4,Kilroy Was Here ~ Styx,"I see a lot of bad reviews here, I can't understand why. I know this album is not as good as Crystal Ball, The Grand Illusion, Pieces Of Eight or Paradise Theater, but it is worth 4 stars for sure! The only bad song on this album is Double Life. The voice of James Young isn't so good on this album. He sings very low and bad. He also sings ugly on Heavy Metal poisoning. Beneath you can see how I rate the songs:1. Mr. Roboto(8/10)2. Cold War(8/10)3. Don't Let It End(10/10)4. High Time(8/10)5. Heavy Metal Poisoning(6/10)6. Just Get Through This Night(10/10)7. Double Life(4/10)8. Haven't We Been Here Before(10/10)9. Don't Let It End Reprised(8/10)I don't recommend this album if you are new with Styx. If you are new with Styx you should buy The Grand Illusion, Crystal Ball or Pieces Of Eight. If you are a Styxfan and you like Cornerstone and Paradise Theater, then this is something for you."
3,Good material.,"Kilroy Was Here is a good album from Styx. I find all of the tracks to be listenable and respectable. The album consists of nine tracks. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are solid. Kilroy Was Here is in a pop rock musical direction. I've never paid much attention to the album's conceptual story. The songs that I like the most are ""Mr. Roboto,"" ""Don't Let It End,"" and ""Just Get through This Night."" ""Mr. Roboto"" has good energy and is a memorable tune. ""Don't Let It End"" is a nice ballad with good vocals from Dennis DeYoung. Tommy Shaw also does a likeable job with the vocals on ""Just Get through This Night."" ""High Time"" has cool backing vocals, too. The lyrics to ""Heavy Metal Poisoning"" are a trip, also. Kilroy was Here is worth a listen."
1,A true tour de force.,"If I ever reach the brink of suicide, yet lack the will to go through with it, I will simply listen to ""Mr. Roboto""Wait, they have it in Real audio! Goodbye cruel world."
4,You Either Love or Hate this one,"This albums is a love / hate relationship with the audience. Either this was your first experience with Styx as a kid (as it was mine) and you had fun with it and like the 'story' the music told.Or you're a die hard Styx fan who thinks this is the album that completely killed the group.Either way, if you're a fan of the 80s no collection could be complete without this one."
1,kilroy hemroidal ointment,warning do not lisen to this album it will enflame your hemroids. This album SUUUUCCCKKKSSS!
1,Kilroy was here...and he left,"An unsettling miasma of rock and roll cliches and generally bad music. All the Tylenol in the world can't cure the pain of listening to a Styx album. Get Madonna's ""Confessions on a Dancefloor"" instead."
1,Styx hits bottom and never recovers,"After steadily declining from their peak (Grand Illusion & Pieces of Eight), Styx hits bottom under the weight of Dennis DeYoung's ego and pretense, never to recover.And they dressed up like the Village People to boot."
1,stupid,"What drivel this is.The worst album by the worst band to ever have made it big.Tuneless with a ridiculous story,this is the low point of overblown arena rock."
1,GREATEST MUSICAL TRAVESTY OF ALL TIME!!!,"Let me start off by saying that I am a Styx fan. I even saw them in concert in Aug. 1999, and it was a great show. However, they didn't play any music off of this album and there is a reason why. This is without a doubt the worst music I have ever heard. There are 9 songs on the album, and each one of them are terrible. The first time I listened to this album I laughed so hard that I was in tears. ""Cold War"" and ""Heavy Metal Poisoning"" are the worst. Don't waste your time or money on this one unless you want a good laugh. Someone wrote in another review, ""Listen to their earlier music, it rocketh much more."" This is some very good advice."
1,The Single Most Embarrassing Moment in Rock and Roll,"***********************TONIGHT ONLY************************************************PUPPET SHOW*************************************************SPINAL TAP****************************************STYX: PERFORMING ""KILROY WAS HERE""**************"
2,The album that finished Styx...,"I really never liked this album, the last by the ""classic"" lineup of Styx. This album seriously wounded the band, and the subsequent tour pretty much killed it off. It's really a pity that it came to such a disasterous end. As for the album, the only song that's really good is James Young's sole contribution Heavy Metal Poisoning, a funny, rocking take on right wing religious fundie types irrational hatred of heavy metal music (remember this was the 80's when heavy metal was ""killing"" our kids...now their target is rap music). Mr. Roboto is really annoying, and Don't Let It End is the worst ballad Styx ever did. This album is pretty much DeYoung's baby, and the tour was as well. They actually acted parts on stage inbetween songs on the tour (which was in arenas, not small venues), and the fans were furious. The rift it caused in the band never healed, even to this day. So unless you're a Styx completist, skip this one."
2,Quite an intriguing curiosity,"As an album, ""Kilroy was Here"" is bad. However, I bought it for 3 dollars on vinyl and I don't regret it for a moment. It's worth it just for Mr Roboto. For the most part Mr Roboto is a pretty good song. Then at the end, it's utterly and completely ruined by the silliest ending I know. The singer sings ""Now everyone can see / My true Identity! / I'M KILROY! / KILROY! / KILROY!/ Kilroy."" This may just sound dumb, but I swear that when I heard this I was on the floor in convulsive laughter. Indeed the problem that permeates the entire CD is that Styx took themselves too seriously. This is a very stupid story (for added hilarity, it is included in the liner notes), and the sound is so very dated that it's like watching a band's career crash like the hindenburg. Mr Roboto is the funniest thing I've ever heard, the album is terrible, make your own call."
2,"Ouch, is this album bad",The concept is horrible and completely unoriginal. Don't Let It End was done much better as The Best of Times and Mr. Roboto and Heavy Metal Poisoning just plain suck.The only thing that keeps this CD from getting 1 star is Shaw's Just Get Through This Night and JY's Double Life.
4,Classic Styx,"My favorite group from my teens, Styx doesn't disappoint. These songs were burned into my consciousness, and I finally got around to replacing my LP with a DVD. Way better to own than to ""borrow"" from iTunes."
4,"Wow, what do you say about this album, 25 years later?","Styx was my favorite band growing up. I got really into them when Cornerstone was released, and followed up through Kilroy. At the time, I thought Kilroy was an interesting idea, more of a musical than an album, and very, very corny.Looking back on it now, it's still a very well known album, ""Mr. Roboto"" is pretty much universally known. So I think they made their point."
3,This Is Not As Bad As Some Think,"Besides a greatest hits album that I have, this is the only other Styx release that I own. I remember this album years ago when it first came out. You don't forget a song like ""Mr. Roboto,"" or ""Don't Let it End."" These are both good songs in my opinion. I like the keyboard playing on the album. ""Cold War"" and ""Heavy Metal Poisoning"" are also good. Not the best album, but still has some good moments."
2,Not The Best Stuff From My Favorite Band,"It's difficult to give a bad review to my favorite band especially where so many reviewers who aren't even Styx fans trashed it already. This album was probably my second least favorite, Miracles being my least favorite. I like Heavy Metal Poisoning. I usually like JY's contribution on each album anyway. I have a live version of Cold War that is much better than the studio version. I like the reprise of Don't Let End more than the hit song. This album needed another rocker. There's a reason Styx doesn't play anything from this album live. Try Equinox or Pieces of Eight. If you like your music a little weirder, try Serpent is Rising."
3,Ambitious effort at best,"When I first bought this album in the 80's, it was one of the coolest albums ever, however it just doesn't quite stand the test of time. It has some really great songs, JY's ""Double Life"" and Tommy Shaws ""Just Get Through This Night"" but it also has some really horrible songs such as ""Haven't We Been Here Before"" and ""High Time.""This album is really a marker of when Styx completely lost it's edge becoming heavily dependent on Dennis ""The Hit-Maker"" DeYoung. Tommy Shaw soon left the band due to it's lightweight nature and JY put out a great rocking album with Jan Hammer which was heavily reminescent of the original lineup of STYX of the early 70's.If you want to listen to the real STYX, buy Serpent, Styx I and II, and the last real Styx album Equinox. These are heavy on JY vocals and guitar solos."
3,Kilroy was here,The only problem that I have with this album is it's too short. I honestly could never critique this because of this reason.
2,Needs more and better songs.,"Well, I bought this CD because I love Mr. Roboto and thought the story was interesting. The problem is the record doesn't stand on its own, unlike other great Rock Operas. The songs aren't that great and don't grab the listeners attention. The role playing by the different members of STYX isn't that intriguing. And it needs to be longer. The story begins after the interesting stuff has happened: Music is persecuted, Moral Majority takes over, people become reliant on machines. The bulk of the plot is listed as back story. How great would it have been to have a number by Kilroy while he's in prison? It just needed more. This would have been a great idea for a movie had the songs been greater in quantity and quality. I was hoping this record would rank up with the Rock Opera great such as the Wall and Quadrophenia, but it ended coming up quite short."
1,"If you love Styx, skip this one!","For all the reasons you could possibly love 70's Styx you could loathe this one for all the same reasons. This album has nothing that the classic Styx albums have. The crackling solos, heavy riffs and intelligent harmonizing vocals are replaced with a mechanically overproduced overly eighties approach which lacks substance. With DeYoung doing what Lionel Richie did to the Commodores, this band didn't stand a chance after it was reduced to a ballady sappy sad shell of a rock band. Listening to this album is about as pleasurable as a root canal. It acually makes 1979's Cornerstone sound like a good album, and that's hard to do. I love Styx, so I prefer to think of this as a DeYoung solo experiment gone dreadfully wrong. 'Nuff said, don't waste your time."
4,"good solid album, but not their best","Kilroy was a good CD, good sounds, nothing really sucks on it, but its not a solid classic as say 'The Grand Illusion"" or ""Cornerstone"". But it is good, and the DVD has been released in 2007, it shows the 12 min film of ""Kilroy"" and the 1984 concert in the SuperDome. Along with classic videos"".Styx was nearing the end here, infact, I really thought after ""Parasise"" they'd go on to do solo work, its a decent CD. 8 out of 10 stars."
2,Not the best Theme Album,"Although Styx was my favorite group growning up, this was one of their weaker albums. I love the idea of a theme album, but this was simply a capitalization of their popularity at the time."
1,unmitigated disaster,"this is not only undeniably the worst music by Styx I've heard, but also the worst music anywhere! I mean, no wonder JY quit for six years and Shaw for eleven. The music is the cheesiest new wave shlock ever to ""grace"" vinyl, and the album is also lyrically inept (just listen to the stoooopid lyrics on ""Heavy Metal Poisoning""). ""Mr. Roboto"" also received NO. 1 Trash video on MTV on a countdown several years ago, and one viewing will show you why. Fans walking out of a show of this horrific travesty--that is all the verdict you need for this waste of tape. Avoid like the plague--listen to their earlier music, it rocketh MUCH more!"
2,Kilrory should have stayed home,"Styx keyboardist Dennis DeYoung finally acknowledges that he'd rather be writing broadway musicals than rock albums on the ridiculous 1984-esque ""Killroy Was Here."" Styx was getting pretty desperate in their fight against musical irrelevance by this time. But DeYoung's attempt at ""significance"" is a laughable. Granted, the title song has good guilty pleasure appeal, but the rest of it is simply disposable. If ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" is the best of the art rock story album genre, this is certainly the worst."
2,Ummm.....,"I'm not sure if I really like this game. Don't get me wrong I love B-Ball and almost every other B-Ball game I've played on consoles b4, but the graphics in this game is one pixel short of wack. The players look like half done polygons and are sooo stiff.I can hardly make a shot (in easy mode) while the opponent makes EVERY single one. But all in all after getting over the less than acceptable polygon rendering and you (I) really get entrenched in the game you kinda forget that your playing with stiff expressionless half-baked polygons.I can't make a free throw...how do you make a freethrow in this game???Purchase at your own leisure...I'll still play it (not that I'll really enjoy it) afterall I already bought it."
5,Awesome Game!!,This is the best basketball game I have ever played on PC....graphics are just mind blowing...game play...and features....not to mention the price...EA really knows how to make games. Download the demo to give it a try first.
2,Worst NBA game,"There are so many lousy plays in this game.Firstly, it is so hard to get a defensive rebound. Offensive rebound will make up 40% of your total rebounds. Once the opponent gets a offensive rebound, the opponent will keep getting the rebound until he score.Secondly, the response of the keys are so slow that switching players will be very difficult and the movement of your player are pretty slow also resulting in lousy defense.Thirdly, the opponent's guard always does the scoring regardless of who he is, even a rookie. And he will come up with a bunch of points like 50 points in a game which is ridiculous.Fourth, whenever the player attempt an unsuccessful steal or blocks the shot of the court, it is counted as a turnover.The only thing improvement from the previous games is in terms of the fast break and the inside scoring moves."
5,"A 'must' reference, especially for consumers just starting out in gem collecting or investing","The second updated, expanded edition of COLORED GEMSTONES: THE ANTOINETTE MATLINS BUYING GUIDE is on the market and it's not to be missed for any avid gem collector. Here are all the basic keys to gems; from initial assessment of the factors which lend value to descriptive names, misnomers, facts on hardness and wearability and more. A 'must' reference, especially for consumers just starting out in gem collecting or investing.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Gems,"There is a lot of good information in this book. However, it is not for someone new to the trade. Not many pictures to use while reading. makes it hard to follow certain parts of the text."
4,Good beginner reference,"I bought both this and the Renee Newman book at the same time. This one is good, and they complement each other some, but if you can get only one, I would go for the Newman book."
3,Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"Its an interesting movie. Synopsis: Earth's Van Allen Belts are on fire! And the Earth is slowly burning up in the roast spit. One daredevil Admiral with his new Nuclear Submarine has a theory that if a nuke missile is exploded in the belt, it will cause the burning belt to explode away from Earth.Of course the UN and other scientists do not think so, and send subs after this nuke sub. Meanwhile sabotage abroad the nuke sub by a pessimist causes mayhem.All the while, a good popcorn snowy-weekend movie.Not great, but also not bad.BTW, No graphics, so better since it is real."
3,1 + 5 / 2 = 3,"This might seem like one of those annoying marketing gimmicks, which is to bundle one bad product with one good one -- except that it's fairly priced and even better, available for rent. Fantastic Voyage rates a solid 5 stars for its imagination and spectacle, and also for a story that I found absolutely riveting after a couple hits. My only slam is that you could occasionally see the wires in plain view in some of the miniature shots -- but hey, this was the Sixties! On the flip-side (literally), Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea was so intellectually insulting that even my kids wouldn't watch it after the first few minutes. So, since this was an double feature, the average is 3 stars. This is similar to the 5-star The Fly and the 2-star The Fly II. But hey, who would actually watch The Fly II or Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea unless they were bundled?"
4,"If you enjoyed ""Fantastic Voyage""...","...then you should check out ""Innerspace"", from the mid eighties, which is based on a similar idea and is also a fun movie. It will be released on DVD in July 2002."
3,Please don't even think Forbidden Planet when these two come up!!!,"Of course you should add these to your collection if you are compulsive or teach a course in SF film - or are a really big Isaac Asimov fan (he wrote FV). But if you liked/loved Forbidden Planet you will not find any comparison amusing (well, you could compare Walter Pigeons' performances). Forbidden Planet is a (well deserving) classic SF film, FV and VtoBoS were both made on film."
3,Cheapo S-Saens for the mass market,"PLEASE NOTE THAT CHARLES MACKERRAS IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND ON THIS DISC which is however not bad as a sampler of the music of Saint-Saens, considering it is budget price."
2,THE MOST NEAGTIVE MOVIE ABOUT LANZA I HAVE EVER WATCHED,"This is a terrible ""tribute"" to Mario Lanza. All this DVD did was take out the bad things about Lanza and show them off. It made the impression that the only ""good"" thing about him was his voice. NOBODY IS PERFECT. So why ""glorify"" it. They never show the good in him. There is allot more good in a person then there is bad. Hollywood ruined him, and he fell for it. Yes, he did do some bad things but nobody's perfect. Are you perfect? I am not. He IS the second greatest tenor next to Caruso. This movie doesn't deserve to be on a DVD, in stead it needs to be in the trash. (The 2 star rating I gave this ""movie"" is for the acting.)"
4,This stand really holds cymbals!,"I am a big dude and I am not a pro drummer. I hit hard and wild and often out of control. Being that I am a beginner at the drums certain things tend to happen. Things get broken. So far the stand has not taken a fall though. It seems very stable and can take my abuse!... and the wingnut is a nice size, unlike the tiny, easy to lose, wingnuts that came with my drum set!"
4,Solid stand,"This is a sturdy, lightweight, inexpensive stand. I'm not a heavy-hitter, though, so if you like to bash your cymbals, you might need something beefier.My only complaint is that it didn't come with a memory-lock clamp."
3,"I like it, but...","It's sturdy enough not to fall over on you, and works great for small cymbals like 8""-12"", but it wobbles backwards with my 14"" China on it. It's also not very thick, so I doubt it will do very well if I clamp on another cymbal like I plan on doing. I plan on returning this and buying an SP880BS from guitar center for the same price as this stand."
2,Don't judge by its cover,"I bought this book for two reasons: one, because the Kinkade-like cover is gorgeous, and two, because Jesus Christ's birth in Bethlehem was the earthly beginning of his journey to the cross. I'm trying to read at least one book on the cross of Christ per year, and this was my 2004 choice. Unfortunately, what's between the front and back covers is not proportional to the beauty of the cover. Ayers is simply not a great writer; some of his turns of phrase made me cringe, if I'm honest. Overall his theology is okay, but then again, some of it was off kilter. When I'm reading a book I'm looking for a) original ideas, or b) old ideas reiterated in a fresh way. This book had none of the former and a few of the latter. Two books concerned with the relation between the manger and the cross that I'd recommend over Ayers' book are Christ Our Mediator by C.J. Mahaney (Multnomah) or Christ's Incarnation by Charles Spurgeon (Pilgrim Publications). Happy reading!"
3,Can't do better for the price,"This is really a very cool phone for the price paid, it's true, sometimes you get static, but that doesn't happens often, and you can solve it by charging your phone, but for the price paid, have you found something better??? this phone will make the job whithout you having to incurr in higher prices."
1,A chewed on phone is not acceptable,"I received this phone and opened the box and found the antenna chewed on and something spilled or spit on the handset. I am totally disgusted with this. I contacted the seller and he/she wrote back a very rude email and told me not to waste their time. I sure hope Amazon can help me get my money back. Never again will I order a product from a private seller. Buyer beware is all I can say. Used products are one thing, but to sell a product that has been chewed on YUCK!!!!!"
1,"Really, really small cap",This cap is made of nylon that is not really stretchy. It barely expands to a diameter of 5-6 inches across. It doesn't fit on me and probably won't fit on most adult heads.
5,JAR,"I love Fred Astaire Movies, classic movies there's nothing like these type of movies. excellent...."
4,Escape Entertainment,"If you are looking for something light and airy and not demanding, Astaire and Rogers are just the ticket. Contrasted with today's movies, the changes are significant. These movies are just meant to entertain. Occasionally one needs to go back in time and not be concerned with the messages of today's movies."
4,Astaire & Rogers Dance the Night Away,"This is a great collection for any Astaire &Rogers fan or if you love Movie Musicals in general. The films have transferred beautifully & the extras are pretty entertaining. The only thing I wish is that this first set had focused on the early RKO films. I would have loved to see ""The Gay Divorcee"" in this collection. But all and all a great addition to any movie library. Hopefully there'll be a second set or even just an Astaire musical collection."
5,On To Volume 2!!!!,"After years of wishing and waiting, the famous dancing couple finally comes to the longer lasting DVD with wonderful bonuses of quirky shorts and cartoons that can bring us all back to the 30s.With 5 of 10 on DVD I will now begin the wishing and waiting for the second 5. I am sure that if both Astair and Rogers were still with us they would be overjoyed to know that their work was being made to last."
5,Diane Midgett,"This is one of the greatest of Fred Astairs movies, the dancing and musical is just great, well worth the money to have in your library."
3,Astaire & Rogers Collection,I was disappointed in the collection as I believe there are better DVD's out there that I would have liked better that the ones in this particular collection. Learn from mistakes and select only the ones that give you great enjoyment.
5,Great old movies.,Great collection of old Astair/Rogers movies. Weak on plot but good occasions for singing and dancing. Nice for when you're in that kind of mood.
5,Joy with a quibble,"The appearance of this set is an occasion to celebrate, as all the reviews make clear. But dare I introduce a small note of disappointment? I would gladly have sacrificed the Barkleys of Broadway here for The Gay Divorcee (1934) whose cast, mood, etc. make it a much better companion for Top Hat et al. P.S. I see now that the Gay Divorcee was being saved for Part Two of the DVD box sets--an attempt, no doubt, to get Astaire-Rogers fans to buy all 10 films! It will succeed with me eventually, no doubt. Pardon me for being an igneous intrusion!"
4,They omitted Gay Divorcee,"I can't believe they did not include Gay Divorcee, the first and one of the best of the Astaire-Rogers productions that included the classics, Night and Day and The Continental.The Night and Day dance number is one of the most exquisite dance sequences ever choreographed.Pandro Berman must be sick in his grave."
5,Heavenly,Pandolfi is like no other pianist. This will soothe all your worries and relax you beyond belief. One of my absolute favorites!
5,By Request,This CD album is just beautiful. Not one of them is hard to listen to. They are all unforgettable. Well worth buying!
5,best material to start with design patterns,"This is book is the best place to start your learning design patterns...once you are through with it, enhance your understandin with gang of four."
1,bathomas,"This album sux. Don't buy it. No atmospherics. Beats are juvenile. ""World Music"" bent is cheesy. Why they'd need 4 dudes to produce this is beyond me. Very amateurish. They need vocals because their sounds aren't interesting enough to stand alone. I've bought albums like this before and everytime swear I never will again. Whoops. Thing is, I actually thought I'd given this a listen. Not closely enough."
2,to complicated,I paid my subscription in April; we are July and I still do not have the magazine. Every time I try to read the magazine they want to charge me for he magazine ($2.99). I am going to try one more time.
1,Horrible service- waste of money!,"Purchased a 2 year subscription through Amazon as a gift. Recipient NEVER received even one issue. I didn't find out until a year into it. When I contacted their service department, they said it was being sent to the correct address. Ummm, so why hasn't she ever gotten it? I will NOT be renewing this obviously, but I have a feeling that pursuing a refund will not be easy. Total waste of money. Awful service. Don't bother paying for something you'll never get."
3,Service not good as a gift,"I bought this as a present for my sister, not realizing it was defaulting to my address until I went through with the order. I immediately contacted the subscription company to change the address, but long story short I ended up hand delivering every issue to her for the entire year. The magazine itself is great, and as a Hispanic advertiser I can attest to it being at the forefront of Latino content, but the service was less than remarkable."
2,"Contents are boring, unless you like fashion, make-up, celebrities, etc.","For a heterosexual guy, People en Espanol is boring. Issue after issue, it's nothing but ""beautiful"" celebrities (an ""overkill"" with Penelope Cruz in every issue); what celebrity got married or divorced; overpriced fashion; jewelry; make-up; hair-do; etc. People in English has similar contents; but it also has stories on current events, politics, and other news worthy stories. If People en Espanol would follow the English verison and cover current news events, it would be much more interesting to me. As it stands now, subscribing to People in Espanol was a mistake for me!"
3,TRACK YOUR GIFT ORDERS!!!,"I have been renewing my subscription to People en Espanol for over 3 years now through Amazon. I just happened to visit my grandmother (September 2009) and ask her how she liked her magazines. I didn't see them out anywhere in her stash of reading materials. She said that she hadn't received one since October 2008. I immediately called the magazine's customer service. They stated that they had incorrectly recorded the address using Avenue instead of Drive (as listed in the order) and the magazine was noted as undeliverable since October 2008. They agreed to extend my subscription for the 11 month difference. Don't get me wrong, this is a great magazine, I was just disappointed that they failed to notify me (at my billing address, which is different than the shipping address) that my magazine ""gift"" was undeliverable. Thank goodness for grandmother's memory. I will not renew this year."
4,Hiphop and cold beer,"Corona Queens NY's best beatmen dropped this slamming Ep 2 years ago and its still worth a spin. A few remixes got new verses from Al Tariq (the last member of the trio) and Grand Puba plus you get the dancefloor vibrating Off the Books remix featuring Punisher -RIP- as a bonus. My favorite is the psychedelic keys sample on Treats. These dudes do not follow trens.Beatnuts are gonna stay dope and drunk, forever."
2,crust,a grip of crippled remixes. why would you take killer tracks and f them up? this cd is a waste.
4,just right,A good size for a few cloth diapers but you can squeeze in more if you try. I like the little handle on top. Washes and dries just fine. No complaints.
3,"Save the Money. Buy ""Ditty Bags"" instead.","This wet bag is cute. It has a zipper. It's big enough to hold a day's wet diapers. But, it's kinda pricey.I need to have at least 5. One for my diaper bag. One for my car and at least 3 to rotate between home and daycare. That can get pretty expensive.If you aren't too attached to the idea of cutesy prints, check out ditty bags.Outdoor Products Ditty Bag 3-Pack (Colors May Vary)They are the same concept. Only much cheaper. You can get multiple sizes. Some are even big enough to be a pail liner."
2,Started Leaking after 2 washes,We purchased two of these bags for use in our diaper pail. After being washed twice one of the bags started leaking through the PUL (as if the PUL was permeable). I now notice that the second bag is doing the same. I would not recommend these bags since they don't do what they are supposed to.
5,Very nice,"I LOVE this bag. It is very well made, smell stays contained, I fit about 6 Medium diapers in it and I like the fact that it has a zipper to keep the smell in."
4,As Expected,"Practical, as expected, could be slightly larger for use with bum genius diapers. Fills up quick. Otherwise good bag, keeps odor in."
2,"Okay product, poor construction","The bag is not the best wet bag I've purchased, but it was the least expensive. The stitching at the top is already coming off and I've only washed it once!"
5,"Simple design, but a must have for cloth diaper users....","I bought this to put my daughter's wet and dirty diapers in while we were out of the house. Now, I use all the time - at home or on the road. It contains the diaper odor well, doesn't leak and keeps the diapers together until they're ready for washing. I just throw the bag in the wash with the diapers to keep it smelling fresh. I love this product!"
1,poor construction,"i got 2 of these wetbags as gifts. my blue one had the stitching start unraveling after less than a month of use. the red one had the zipper pull fall off after 4 months. both of these leaked thru the PUL (and not with soaking diapers inside). they are a great size for travel, but i can't use them anymore b/c they are falling apart.**UPDATE: i tried to contact manufacturer. they said i must contact the place i purchased the wetbags. Amazon said i could not return unless it was in new condition. if it was in new condition, i wouldn't need to return. they (amazon) suggested i try to sell the wetbags as ""used"" on their site. anyone want a non-functioning wetbag?"
3,"Bare bones, but gets the job done.","I bought this wetbag because it was cheaper (by far) than some of the prettier ones I saw. It is very basic. It does not have a fabric sewn on the outer layer, rather, it's just one piece of fabric that has the plasticky lining on one side. As a wetbag, it is big enough and well constructed. I think the only set back to this is that it seems a little stinkier with poopy diapers inside than the 2 layer ones, but only slightly, because poopy diapers just stink.I took this to the pool as well and it leaked slightly with very wet stuff inside. Never has leaked with just diapers though.Pros: inexpensive, good constructionCons: fabrics are not pretty, you feel closer to the poop or wetness than with a lined wetbag."
2,Amazon is great...this is Meh,Not a bad little player for music...However the interface is very outdated and has horribly crappy battery life. The biggest drawback I found was when listening Audio books it constantly lost it's place. Basically if you didn't mentally book mark where you were at you were likely to spend thirty minutes or more trying to find out where you left off the next time you fired it up...and that's if the battery wasn't dead.
2,Just wasn't interested!,"Normally, I really enjoy Judith Ivory's books. I even thought the twist that the heroine was older would make the book more interesting-- have more depth etc. However, it was just plain boring. The hero was not the typical romantic ""hero"" and I guess that is what I really didn't care for. I like being caught up in the whole story, the whirlwind romance etc and this was just not that story. I've read some of the other reviews and agreed that if you need the torrid romance, the suspense, the damsel in distress etc then this is not the story for you. Obviously it wasn't for me but that doesn't mean it won't be for someone else-- well then fair reader.. fore warned is forearmed."
3,Couldn't get over the heroines age...,"I know, I know. Pretty lame. As soon as I read she was almost 40, the visage of a wrinkled elegant lady appeared in my head and I couldn't shake it. I could NOT get my mind to grasp that she should be a woman in her prime and very desirable. Because of this, I just couldn't get into the story. If the hero was older, it would not have been a problem.However, because I couldn't finish the book (despite the story being interesting) I don't feel I can justify giving a one or two star rating simply because I couldn't get over the heroines age. So, I'm rating SLEEPING BEAUTY as a three. Judith Ivory has the ability to write an engaging story and she came highly recommended by a couple friends. I liked the plot line, I thought the way James and Coco met brilliant and the story was interesting enough but the age thing didn't work.I'm planning to giving the author another chance and reading a different story."
3,Not-So-Magic,"Unlike the Grandmothers (ex-Mothers of Invention), this band of ex-Captain Beefheart alums seems content to coast on 30-year old laurels. Although the sound here is close to the original (even without their leading talent Bill ""Zoot Horn"" Harkleroad), the band slogs through essentially unchanged renditions from the Beefheart catalog. It's like a particularly-qualified Beefheart cover band -- and who wants to hear ersatz Beefheart without Don?I would have much preferred if they'd taken their undoubted talents and come up with a album of new tunes. They always said the Magic Band wrote ""Trout Mask"" as much as Don -- why not prove it?"
2,How sad.,"How embarassing. You'd think these guys, most of whom who claim to have been great enough to earn co-arrangment credits along with Van Vliet, would be too busy creating their own fine and dandy material to have time for stuff already 30+ years old. Use the Mallard name again, produce some NEW music. Eh?Don's moved on, shame they haven't.John French, you're talented & smart! Why in God's name are you making an ass of yourself by poorly imitating the Captain's vocals? They were given the chance to tackle the stuff again, why not leave it at instrumentals? The sample of ""Moonlight on Vermont"" alone reveals the singing as what it is. Shoddy emulation."
1,Poor for text,"I use my computer for spreadsheets, word processing, and reading web pages. Outside of native resolution, which I find too small for extended use, most monitors are unpelasant to use.I found this monitor to be poor for text. I turned the brightness and contrast to 0, down from the default setting of 70-80 and it was still horrible.No matter how I set the brightness/contrast/resolution I could barely see the Spreadhseet cells borders.I got eyestrain as well.I would not use this monitor if I was given it for free. (I returned it)Instead I loved (and bought) the HP W2207. The HP is so much better for text, its a huge difference."
3,Loved it until...,"I loved this monitor.... until the backlight died! After about a year and a half it wouldn't light anymore, though the panel was still working.Aside from that, it was a great low budget photo editing monitor. impressive native contrast and color accuracy (Dynamic contrast is undesirable IMO), and very bright. Too bright at default setting, but easily adjusted. Viewing angle was pretty good for a TN panel. I would have given better score if it still worked!"
2,Mildly disappointed,"Bought this as a re-furb unit. Digital input is inop, but the analog works. Hence mildly disappointed with my purchase. Very happy with the monitor overall though."
1,Don't buy this!,"I went somewhere else (not Amazon) and bought this monitor for my brand new computer - and once hooked up my computer kept shutting down and rebooting for no apparent reason. It also cause Internet Explorer to shut down several times. At first I thought it was the cable but the user cannot put a better cable on this monitor since the ""cut out"" on the back won't fit anything correctly - possibly including the cable that came with it. I returned the monitor and hooked up my old 17 inch NEC monitor - it's a little blurry around the edges but at least my new computer isn't being randomly rebooted!1 star rating is too high for this - it's about a negative 5 star in my book!My advice to anyone? Buy NEC!"
1,Thank you so much for the excerpt.,I was tempted to buy just because of the catchy title. I'm glad that Amazon provided the excerpt. This would have been a great dissapointment. You get more information on interactive TV from reading the newspaper.
5,Really good book,"This is a really good book. Its the best I've read so far, especially since she meets 7 of her other clones. Some of it is kind of confusing, like the end-but the rest is good"
2,Not the best,"This book was not as good as any of the other ones that I've read, but because it's part of the series, you have to read it. The end was not as exciting. It was still really good, though."
5,"Perfect Girls, perfect book!","Marilin Kaye has done it again! In this replica book, Amy Candler, a 12 year old clone who's perfect, becomes a finalist in an essay contest in Ney York City. But little does Amy know when she is poisoned, and meets the other clones that were made, was this a dream or reality? You decide! Marilin Kaye combines science fiction with every day life and creates a thrilling and suspensefull series of books! In my opinion, read them all!"
3,Okay Book,"This book was kinda sorta good. It wasn't the best in the series, but the way it was written was cool."
5,"This book is filled with srange twists, fun and excitement!","Amy Candler is perfect! She was has just discovered the secret of her past. It's wierd to know you were made in a labratory!! Amy can do anything humanly possible but to the extent of her ability! She has just won her way into the top finalist of an essay contest. During dinner she passes out.When she wakes up she is in a hospital surrounded by doctors who are holding her against her will! Amy knows something is wrong. She's never been before. Ever! Then her supposed doctor turns agenst her! Can Amy save herself and her newfound clones(or sisters) before it's to late! Will they listen to her, trust her!?.Then Amy discovers one of her own kind, her own clone, is collaberating with their enemy!! ....But wait she has woken up! It must have been a dream!! Or was it.... Time is running out for Amy and her sisters!"
4,Excellent!,"Wow, this tastes excellent! I'm a huge fan of Quinoa and stumbled across this, so looking for a ""treat"" I bought it. The flavor is wonderful, only problem is that it's been out of stock, I'm waiting so I can buy a few of them to stock up."
3,No Ackermann function,"Computability: An Introduction to Recursive Function TheoryI have a better book that gives a better introduction to this field. I have read several books (older and newer) along these lines.While this book gives a bad introduction to the tiling problem,it ignores what is pretty much a ""standard"" problem inmodern texts : the Ackermann recursion. The text takes the Mathematical high road and leaves most of the human race out in the cold by lack of good illustrations and explanations.If I were teaching the course in computation , I might tell students to look this book up in the library, but never make themspend this much for a text that will fail all but the top 5 % of students."
2,not enough examples,"Theres not enough examples, and there aren't an answer key for the chapter reveiw questions. I can't understand why the odd answers were not at least givin. How do the author expect students to know whether he is or is not answering the problem correctly if there are no answer keys"
2,"A reference at best, a textbook from hell","I took a Theory of Computation class with Harry Lewis, one of the book's author this last semester at Harvard. Lewis may be a gifted professor, but if you are looking for a textbook, look for something else (Sipser would be a much better idea). It is impossible to learn from this book; the examples are too complex, the questions are outlandishly difficult. I got my A but it was not thanks to this book. Steer clear."
1,No comparison to Feynman,"After reading this book and then reading other comments on this book, I felt compelled to put in my two cents worth. Contrary to another reviewer's opinion, this book is NOTHING like the Feynman lectures. Those books are so well written they can be read and understood by people with no background in physics. This text is complex and elegant in some places, but not something I would really recommend for a beginner (ie. someone unfamiliar with abstract models of computation). If you want a book that conveys the same material in a much more concise and understandable manner, buy the Sipser text."
2,"The given examples are good, but not enough examples","I had to get this book for a Theory of Computation class. This book does not give enough examples for you to fully understand the concepts. Although the chapters are short and easy to follow, you get no more than two examples per chapter and the given examples do not help you with the questions at the end of each chapter. How do they expect you to get the answers right if they don't give you examples?"
2,Why I don&#65533;t recommend this book.,"Like any other book some people like it but others don't, since readers come from different backgrounds it is some time's your background and previous knowledge which will lead your absorption to a books material, since I cant assess any of the potential readers ability's and background I will give you a general reason why I will not recommend this book.When Material is tough and hard to absorb a writer should try doing one of two things. He could build up knowledge from the easy stuff up, and some extra explanation or he could at least keep you interested and willing to repeat what you have just read and these writers did neither.Review End..."

1,Needlessly cryptic; too clever for its own good,"This book claims to ""make the essentials of the subject accessible to a broad undergraduate audience in a way that is mathematically sound but presupposes no special mathematical experience."" On this count, the book fails miserably. The book starts easily enough with an introduction to sets and languages, but by the time Chapter 3 rolls around, the writing degenerates into the hectoring style of Russell and Whitehead... pages and pages of non-intuitive academic proofs, and making simple concepts needlessly complex in the name of Formality. The concepts the authors are presenting are fascinating, but in order to get to them you have to spend way too much time shuffling symbols. By the time we've made it to Chapters 6 and 7 (the good ones) we've lost most of the students in the muddy bootcamp of Chapters 3 and 4.Don't buy this book, and don't use it to teach; the Sipser book is the way to go."
1,Got the book written in some other language other than English,1)The book I got is having the headings in some other language along with English which isn't there in the original book.2)Also the size of the book is very small and the letter size in the book are very small which is not there in the original book.So I am not satisfied with this book.
2,Not a good book,The book is comprehensive. It is however not easy to follow and even simple concepts are hidden under mathematical terminology. More time is taken up understanding the math than is needed to understand the concept. It may be good for mathematics students but not for CS students. There are too few solved examples.
1,Poor explination coupled with insufficient examples,"This book is a poor choice for the student who does NOT already know the bulk of this material. The authors claim to make this material open to the undergraduate with ""no special mathematical experience"", however they have done little to achieve this goal. Instead, we have brief introductions to specific topics, lengthy proofs of already established theories, and little to help the student in their efforts on the advanced problems. To compound this misjudgement, there are no solutions, partial or full, nor hints to the problems, as many qualified books provide. The unfortunate part is that misguided professors will choose this book based on its title and claims, not its shotty content."
1,Just plain boring.,"When I first signed up for the theory of computation I expected it to be a great class. I had looked over some of the subject material before the course started and it found it very interesting. I mean, who can't find this subject interesting? Learning about not only how computers function but what their limitations are. I'll tell you who, anyone who has had the misfortune of reading this book. I don't know how or why two obviously educated people can write a book that is so lackluster. This book turned my course into an absolute nightmare. I instead turned to another book, which ended up saving me. Do yourself a favor and run from this book as fast as you can."
2,"Not bad, but certainly could be better","As far as reading the chapters goes, this book is pretty dang good. I think it is written well, and is not to difficult to follow if you have a background in Computer Science (in my school, shout out to Stony Brook, this book is used in a 300 level course). However, the book's examples are to few and far between, and there are no solutions to the problems at the end of each chapter. It's hard to recommend this book as a text for a course, but I think it would make a good supplement. If you are taking a class in theory this could give you some additional insight. But go to the library, don't spend the cash.And also... who the hell is this geek on the cover? It doesn't reveal his identity anywhere in the book. You know this book is bad when they have a herb like him staring at you. This guy needs a new suit, a haircut, and he needs to learn how to smile."
4,Enjoying,I am really enjoying this book even though it is takinga littles longer due to the 'language of the time'. The only rotten thing about it was it took about 5 weeks to get.
5,e-book free edition review,"Tried to read this a few years ago and just could not get into it. I should have tried harder. My daughter had me watch the movie.I loved it! So I saw the ebook free version and decided to make another attempt. Yes, it is written for a more elegant time, yes it is not a easy read, if one is not accustomed to reading old classics. But so worth the effort. I had to be in a room with no distractions.I love it. I rarely give 5 stars to anything. This one hits the mark."
2,Great Novel,"Pride and prejudice is one of the great works in the English language. Unfortunately this particular edition of this work has print so small it is very, very difficult to read."
2,missing pages,"I like the layout and the extra information in this book. What I don't like is that it is missing more than 10 pages of the text. My daughter didn't start reading it until it was too late to return it, so now I am forced to buy another and hope that it has all the pages :("
3,"Good, but unorganized . . .","Good newaza techniques on this dvd, but material is not very organized, and there is not a whole lot of explanation. That being said, the material on this dvd interests me in the other newaza dvd in this series. I'm likely to order it."
5,"Baby, baby, aaaahhhhh","I came across DJ Beck on German TV when on a business trip over there and thought that his solo stuff from Weltweit was terrific. My German friends told me about F4 and I got some of the CDs. This live album is my favorite of their stuff. Der Picknicker, Hammer, Millionem Legionem are great. Actually it's all excellent even though I have no clue what they are saying. So plunk down your hard earned cash with no reservations, kiddies.....this one is a classic!"
4,Excellent compendium on the subject,"While this book stops the conversation at its 2005 publication date, that was pretty much when the hubbub died. While some have said this is a rehash of newspaper articles and little new information is offered, I would first say that's not a bad thing and second, I disagree to some point. I say it's not a bad thing because even if there is little new material, it does put it together in own document where it can be easily accessed. Also, I feel as a fan that I kept up with the subject pretty well and I found some of the information to be new, at least to me. Also, Bryant not only offers information but at times analysis as well. I found this to be an excellent book on the subject, and a good refresher on a ugly time."
2,Juicing The Game,"this book is rather long winded, giving information that has already been printed in newspapers . it also has an entire chapter where this author apologizes for every negative thing that his hero barry bonds ever did, claiming racisism of course being the end all to bonds problems. would not refer the book to any one with any knowledge of baseball."
5,Juicing the Game,An outstanding chronicle of the guilty parties responsible forthe current problems in major league baseball over especiallythe last ten years. An indictment of many from the top down.Turning your back on problems so as not to sacrifice $$$$ ofprofit for control of a big problem in baseball. Who do youtrust anymore?
2,the Fisher S1100 likes to stutter,Had the worse stuttering playback on some dual layer DVDs and likes to stutter when playing PIONEER Anime DVDs for some reason. I thought I got a faulty player returned it for another Fisher S1100 & I encountered the same problems with the replacement unit.
3,Very good to Excellent Product,"By and large a very satisfactory product. The lack of bells and whistles aside, the S1500 has served this consumer well for the past three months. Initial problems arising from vague or misleading instructions (the manual spends several page, - including a free-floating insert - on connecting components while failing to mention that some TV models require that the consumer push the input button in order to switch over to DVD; a one sentence instruction, if that!) were quickly solved through deduction and sober-minded common sense.I have thus far not experienced the sorts of problems other reviewers have complained of. Perhaps the advent of wear will bear these problems out yet for the moment the performance has been exemplary.For the price, the Fisher DVD-S1500 represents excellent value for money for one who is in the market for a starter DVD player."
2,blah,"very sweet and not too salty, with a somewhat odd, very starchy taste like raw corn. Pretty small portion but as a snack it's relatively low in calories. I think I would have enjoyed these a lot more if the corn had been toasted to bring out some more complexity in flavor. They're just really plain and uninspiring. Don't think I'd buy them again."
4,My substitute for Corn Nuts.,"Oh, how I loved the taste of Corn Nuts, but wanting to go organic with my snacks forced me to give up another tasty treat. Thankfully these Sensible Foods Sweet Corn crunchies gives me just enough Corn Nut taste with all the benefits of being an organic product."
4,Like real sweet corn,"These actually taste like real sweet corn kernels. I was hoping more for a crunchy ""Corn Nut"" taste. They are more airy but still tasty."
1,Like all Sensible Fruit Products but not this one!,Felt like I was in the barn eating hay. Too bad I bought a case of 24 of them. So far I have found no one that likes it. I keep try becuase I have quite a few left.
2,Ditch the salt!,"I thought I was just getting freeze dried sweet corn, which I love. They add sea salt and it is sweet and salty. I told them a year ago they need to ditch the salt. A lot of people do not eat salt on corn. I see they haven't chaged it. They should read these reviews."
3,just okay,"I bought this looking for a healthy snack for my kids, and thought my daughter, who won't eat many veggies might especially benefit, because she does like corn. This was an interesting flavor and I didn't mind it, but my kids don't like it and won't eat it, and I didn't need a snack food for me. So for our family, it was a waste of money."
2,Love all there other Sensible Fruit Products but not this one.,"I have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all.However this Sweet Corn is all but Sweet. I would say it should be called Salty Corn.I think they would have a Great Product if they did away with the Salt also, or change the Name to Salty Corn. Cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company-- I dont think they would give the other products a try from there line. ** MyFavorite is : Cherry Berry and Orchard Blend ..."
5,Best Melvins since Honky,"Hostile Ambient Takeover was great, but had a few moments that reminded me of other Melvins albums, e.g. Bullhead, Houdini, Maggot. This one is more unapologetically forward-looking, like Honky, my favorite Melvins release. You can always expect something weird from Melvins, but this is the most immediately gratifying Melvins I've heard in years, while at the same time being unfathomably obtuse and strange. I've seen them six times, and every time, the energy is shattering while the surprise level is very high. This album lives up to that and then some. Another high-quality release from Ipecac. GET VENOMOUS CONCEPT, TOO. It's the best old-school hardcore record since the early eighties."
3,Meh....,"This cd is filled with noises which started to drive me crazy. There are 3 songs on this album. 3 !!! However these three songs are the best ive ever heard. Track 5 Is my all time favorite song. If your buying this cd skip, or turn down the intro to it. If you are going to buy this cd, buy it from here, not F.Y.E. whom charged me 18 bucks for this!"
4,A good basis of a beginner,"I've played classical guitar for over seven years, and this is the book that I have learned the most from. It has a great collection of etudes and pieces to play (Two of my favorites are Se Io M'accorgo and Air) and really good information about the composers. The explanations are quite good.There are some flaws in this book, though. Some of the left hand fingerings are a bit clumsy. Work through them yourself. Be wary of the metranome times, too. Some of them are way too fast for the type of piece. Play them at a speed that is comfortale for you. Thirdly, write out all of the right hand fingerings (pulmar, index, middle, & anular). If you do it that way, you'll come away from this book with a wonderful repertoire or skills and music."
4,Solo Guitar Playing: Book 2 (with CD),"I ditto both previous review. Don't buy this book until after you have completed Noad's book one. It reviews some previous technique, but is much more advanced generally. I found a few mistakes in it so far, in the learning to count notation section, so it does have some notational errors. But overall, so far I think this is a good book worth the money. It would best to use this book in conjunction with a quality classical guitar teacher. Trying to learn classical guitar on your own with no professional guidance is begging to learn terrible playing habits."
2,Eh,It doesn't quite look the same as it does in the picture and the sizing (to me) seemed to be somewhat bigger than the size I had asked for.
3,Looks Fake,"The size and shape are beautiful, but after one day the side stones look dark with no shine. Not impressed."
3,Nice but big,"The stone in this ring is far bigger than we anticipated and my wife doesn't like it because it is so big, it makes quite a flash, and since it is a CZ ring, she feels like it is trying to make a statement that we have more $ than we do.It is very pretty though, if you like big square stones."
5,Perfect solution for me,"I already have a backpack in which I carry my laptop. It didn't have quite as much padding as I wanted and I wanted to protect the laptop from othe items I may carry in the backpack. This sleeve turned out to be the perfect solution. My computer fits perfectly and everything works out great. I have a Dell with a 15"" display, the sleeve fits like a glove and adds considerable padding to the situation. This would be a great solution for carrying a computer in a bag not specifically designed for a laptop. Highly recommended."
4,"Good, functional, but minimalist.","This case does what it does very well, but don't expect any extras. I feel like I can drop my laptop into a backpack along with several textbooks and be confident that it won't be damaged.However, I often find myself wishing it had a sleeve or zippered pocket for things like manuals and cds, so be certain you don't need spaces for anything else.Also, while the zippered opening in the back is a nice touch, it's too narrow to allow access to any ports except those in the center. This means that if your laptop's AC-jack is near one of the ends, you'll still have to remove it from the sleeve to charge it.This sleeve may be right for you, but be sure it does everything you need it to or you could be disappointed."
4,It does the work,"I do not really know what to expect of a product of this kind; it is a fact that it is a quality item as it comes to the way it looks; my 15.4' laptop fits in perfectly and I even have room left; I have used the sleeve for 3 months now and it doesn't show any kind weaknesses or signs of tearing, so I think that is a good value for money; furthermore the fabric it is made of looks quite durable, so I trust my sleeve when it comes to the basic protection it shoud provide."
3,serves the perpose,I have a 15.6 inch laptop and the case is very big for the laptop. You should read the dimentions carefully to see if your laptop would be suitable. The case itself is very nice soft and well padded for the protection of the laptop. I blame the bad sizing on myself and if your laptop fits in the case I would recomend it.
3,Not the best.,"This supposedly 15.4"" case is WAY too big for my 15.4"" laptop. Pretty disappointing, but it still does it's job."
4,Good for the Price,"The sleeve is good for the price. It is perfect in width for my HP DV 5 laptop (Laptop measurements - Height 1.4"" x Width 13.9"" x Depth 9.25""). However, the sleeve is too big depth wise. I have extra room there."
4,For the Naked Notebook,"I bought this way back in September of 05, and would definitely recommend this for anyone buying a 15inch laptop. For the 5 years of constant abuse it has held up fantastically. Sure they're a small hole or two around the seems and the leather zipper tag, is almost gone, but the core sleeve itself does a fantastic job of securing the laptop. Being that i purchased this along with a bag for a laptop, i decided i wanted extra safety factor for the laptop since i was using it for school. I still use it today to secure my laptop even though both are reaching its 5th birthday."
2,Not so much,I bought this to cover the sins of an uncomfortable Futon. It was not thick enough so I had to send it back. I'm sure it's good for something.
4,Nice topper,"This topper came super fast, well before the estimated shipping arrival. It is very comfortable, although a bit thinner than I'd expected. It is also very warm - had to turn the heat down because it does hold in heat a lot.But I am sleeping better - which is what it's really about!"
3,memory foam mattress topper,Great sleeping still feels great. However after a week or so our body impressions are inbedded in the foam.. But it still sleeps better than we had before.. Maybe the saying you get what you pay for is true.. I don't know..
3,The Complete Hunter - Jim Zumbo (MULE DEER),"This is a reaaly good book, however, I felt that a lot of the information was based on common knowledge. I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking to get started at Hunting mule deer!"
5,Thorough discussion,This book and Jim Zumbo's book on Elk Hunting are the best two books of the American Hunter collection.
1,Watch started losing time within 3 weeks of purchase,"This watch had 4 reviews when I bought it and they were mixed. I went ahead and bought this watch since it appeared decent for the price. But after 27 days of using it, I noticed that it started losing time. Thankfully it was within the 30 day return period and I've returned it to amazon, and hope to get the refund.Bottomline: DO NOT BUY THE WATCH."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WATCH,This watch ceased keeping time approx. six weeks after purchase. On approx.11/26 I emailed Amazon for info regarding its return but have yet to hear back from them.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I did not use the watch for about 60 days after purchase so I could not return it. When I did, it erratically stopped and started leaving me with a watch that does not keep time. My last Timex lasted over 10 years. Unfortunately, it appears that they no longer care about quality."
5,Best Effort,"While Fairport Convention has made many fine albums, Leige and Leaf is thier best effort. There is not one weak track on the whole CD. A spectacular performance by Sandy Denny and the band is instrumentally note perfect. You really can't go wrong with this CD. There is nothing not to love about Leige and Leaf."
3,Leig & Lief,"Recording quality only fair for a 180 gram record. Original recording wasn't the best engineered work, but this issue is below the original. Also, too many clicks and pops for a new vinyl press."
5,Magic,"This has often been called the finest folk-rock record ever made. With every reason. Here Fairport Convention miraculously managed not only to create and define a whole new genre, but also set a standard which no-one would ever reach again, themselves included. Sandy Denny's vulnerable and majestic vocals are totally bewitching, the band plays as if the devil himself is breathing down their necks. Everything about this record is magic (although the crummy cd-cover does little justice to the splendid original)."
4,I like it a lot,"Liege and Lief is a very nice album. The vocal melodies, while simplistic and repeat a bunch of times, are interesting enough to keep my attention, and interesting enough to tell a good story. The female singer is really good. Some of the arrangements are really good as well. They can let loose and jam out with the best of them.Fairport Convention sound like they were big fans of Bob Dylan's style of songwriting at the time- sing more or less the same melody over and over while changing the lyrics each time in order to build a story for the lyrically-minded people. An album worth owning."
4,Charm in the Simplicity,"This CD is reproduced from the LP of one of the very first folk rock groups that drew directly from English-Irish-Scot lineage. On it is a rousing rendition of the ill-fated & adulterous affair of the farmhand Matty Groves with the Lady of the House; an atmospheric version of the vampire Reynardine leading his victim over the misty mountain; and the intiguing Tam Lin, with a text replete with alchemical-like references. The rock backup music is a bit primitive judging by today's standards, but there's charm in the simplicity. Highly recommended for the folk/ethnic music connoisseur. Oh yes--the bonus track Sir Patrick Spens is a wonderful folk ballad. Sandy Denny's purist vocals provides the perfect delivery for this material."
5,Great Harmony,One of the best Christian groups. Their vocals are amazing in how they harmonize. Only living together their whole lives singing together could produce music like this. I loved it.
1,Pretty thin,"I ordered this book as part of my retirement planning. It did confirm some things I already knew, i.e. you need a plan, you need to keep active and you need to keep healthy. These are hardly new concepts. While it does have interesting interviews with well known, well heeled personalities, their options are quite different than most. It lacked any meaningful advice or planning tools for self discovery. It is great reading for the American aristocracy. But I don't qualify."
2,Act Three (if you have lots of money),"I was eager to read this book, but quickly discovered that most of the advice and insight provided really only would only be helpful to people who are dripping with money. Not everyone can afford a psycho-therapist or a consulting firm to give them advice on making the transition to retirement. How many of us can afford a private spa to cool off after workouts? How many of us can expect to find diversion in retirement by being on the board of directors?Also, in several places you will find the myth that people who don't work have a meaningful life. This is absolutely not true.The one plus for the book are the resources given Appendix B. Some of the things listed look like they have value to the non-wealthy."
2,Not really worth it,"It does get your heart pumping, but I felt that the cardio took up too much of the video, and got very repeatitive at times. I liked the pilates mat section, as short as it was, she used a lot of moves that I hadn't seen in other videos. ALl in all, I'd give it a ""so so"", I would spend my money on a better one though."
4,Worth it!,I've been doing pilates with an instructor 1:1 for a few months. I wanted to continue my practice at home but add some fat burning to the mix. This DVD fits the bill! I can follow; I sweat and it works! It's worth giving it a try!!
4,great first time pilates dvd,I have tried several pilates workouts and this one really was easy to follow and I felt like I got a good workout. If you have been working out for a while it may be too easy for you. I do suggest it for those just starting out and who want an effective low impact workout.
3,"Okay, but not great","Although the title says Pilates, there's really little pilates involved. I would say this is just like any other fat burning/cardio workouts--a lot of leg work, engaging leg muscles, etc. The first part is like your ordinary workout with lot of squats and leg lifts, the second part (shorter) is the ""pilates"" mat exercises. The mat exercise is not nearly good enough to work on those core muscles. All in all, if you want to get a moderate cardio workout, this is for you. I am pretty fit, so I didn't break into sweats of anything. Heart rate will go up though, but I didn't get a great workout I was hoping for."
5,couch potato to powerhouse,I tried this video based on rave online reviews. I hate gyms and deperately needed to get excited enough about some form of exercise to be able to get into better shape and cultivate a healthier lifestyle. After a few days of using this DVD I actually began to look forward to the workout and when I had to miss two days I missed it. My body is very inflexible but this is helping and it's not boring and difficult like the ones I had rented from the library. I will have no problem keeping this up.
4,Not really Pilates....,"I was surprised to see how much of this video was more like aerobics and less like Pilates. The instructor really takes Pilates moves and speeds them up into a cardio work out. The work out itself is not too difficult... the challenge comes at the end, when you do real Pilates stretches.I would suggest this video to anyone who can't get to the gym and wants a bit of cardio and Pilates.The best thing about this video is the drummer in the background who drums tribal beats while you work out. I've never seen ""live"" musicians on a work out video before..... interesting."
5,Great Ab Workout,"I must say, this is my new favorite workout video. The first part (the cardio part) is not exactly ""pilates,"" but it's a great workout that is not overly repetative. I've worked out with Denise Austin's cardio videos before and just about put my foot through the TV because I was sooo sick of doing the same moves over and over. Ellen Barrett's workout does have repetition, but she throws in different variations and it moves so quickly it's hard to get bored.The second half, the Pillates toning, is the most amazing portion if you want to target your abs. The ab exercises are brilliant! My abs have never felt so good! Plus, the moves aren't that complicated and even someone like me (who isn't that flexible) could do them!"
4,Great for Beginners,"I bought this video to supplement my regular running schedule and use it on days when I can't make it to the gym or outside to run. It's not intensive enough to make me work up a real sweat but I think it's a nice way for a beginning exerciser to get the blood flowing and to elevate the heart rate. If you are looking for a serious core/ab workout, this isn't the video for you."
4,Good beginners cardio workout,"Having had a one-year break from the gym, I found this low-impact workout to be tough enough to get my heartrate up. I have never taken a pilates or yoga class, so I can't speak for the pilates part. Though I occassionally experience knee problems after excercising, I do not, like another reviewer pointed out, have any problems after this workout.Overall a pretty good and easy to follow excercise tape, maybe a bit too short. I'm going to get a pilates video also, so I can learn the proper postures and techniques. Though the instructor talks about ""the core,"" she does not explain the form in detail."
4,Great Workout!,"This workout is a nice change of pace... I usually just spend time at the gym doing cardio and weights, but switching things up with the fat burning pilates is adding tons of variety to my fitness routine! It's easy to catch on quickly, but is still challenging enough that I'm totally feeling the burn multiple days later. Love it!"
3,good workout but doens't fit into my workout schedule,i already do the firm BSS2 and on my off days i need to do regular pilates. the cardio movements here don't let my body rest in between days of doing the firm. the instructor is really nice and energetic though!
3,Not for Beginners,"This was a decent workout but I think it may be a little difficult for someone just starting to excercise. The instructor was good and the the first segment with the cardio routine involves a lot of squats and leg work.I think the name was a bit decieving since it is not your ""traditional"" pilates. Also, because breathing is such an important aspect of pilates, I did not think she provided enough guidance on when to inhale and exhale during the second section. Other than that, it was a decent workout."
2,Not for the beginner,"This workout is definitely NOT for the beginner! I'm trying to get back into shape and rented this video from the library. The instructor does a horrible job of cueing the movements. I was constantly tripping over myself trying to keep up! The only good part of the video was the pilates mat exercises at the end. However, that segment was MUCH too short! Don't waste your money on this!!"
2,very light workout,"very light workout,I recommend this dvd for a beginner, I will give it to my mother, camera is on the drummer at times when you need to see the moves"
2,pointless...,"This was my first work out dvd and man do I regret ever spending money on it. The cardio is horrible, i didn't break a sweat at all. The foot work made me pull something in my leg so but yet after that i continued doing it because i thought well its probboly just a muscle getting used to working out again but no. It's hard being 16 trying to get fit because you need way more cardio. This dvd is called ""fat burning"" pilates, my only question is wheres the fat burning? the abbs part is a killer but besides that its not worth it. Your better off with Crunchs's Dance Party dvd, now thats fun and makes you sweat."
3,Slick,"This video seems OK, and has good production, but I'm beginning to understand that people make different types of Pilates videos. Some videos are more instructional and remain at very basic levels. This is one of those. I guess this is good if you have never exercised in your entire life. But if you have been active in any way, it's probably better to find a video that gives you some gusto."
3,Good Cardio Workout - Not Pilates,I really like the Crunch series of DVD's so when I rented this one I thought I would enjoy it as much as the others. I'm really into yoga and pilates and was hoping for another great pilates workout. What I didn't expect was a standup cardio routine for most of the video. In a way I was disappointed because I don't consider this to be Pilates - but it was still a good workout. I'd consider adding this to my current workout regimen but only on days that I do cardio.
3,"Crunch workout is great, DVD quality is terrible!","I have previously used crunch workout DVD/Videos in the past and find them to be very effective for weight loss and improving health. However, I have only used this DVD a few times the past few months, and it has been breaking up/stopping/freezing mid way through the workout so I cannot complete it. It makes me not want to use it and has prevented me from having an effective workout. Overall rating: Crunch Workout great! DVD quality very poor!"
5,crunch fat burning pilates,"I think that this video is a fun video and effective at the same time. You feel like you have done your workout, but don't feel like you have worked yourself to death. It is enjoyable, and moves quickly so you don't feel like you have been doing the same move forever. Worth my money."
4,A Great Workout!,"I just started doing this video and I swear I already feel better! I was definitely sore after the first day, but it's a fun video with a nice beat and a nice range of motion. The instructor explains things clearly and the exercises are easy to follow. I've never done Pilates before, so maybe if you're experienced, it would be a little too easy."
2,Not for everyone/,Hard to follow and there were moves I could tell if you did this video often you could really hurt yourself. I don't think I like the crunch line to be truthful. They are affordable though. It was just not my kind of workout.
3,Mixed review,"It's a great idea, but not very challenging aerobically, and there are far too many squats. You end up not getting a great workout, with the exception of incredibly sore thighs! Anyway, I use this DVD when I'm feeling lazy and don't really want to work out--""Well, I could at least do the Crunch Pilates routine."" One more complaint--there are a couple of women on the video who can't actually do the knee lifts and some other things Ellen is leading them in because their pants are so low they would come off if they did. I realize that showing one's belly is the thing right now, but if you can't work out properly in what you're wearing, perhaps you should reconsider your workout wardrobe, n'est pas?"
1,A Variation on Real Pilates,"The production is good. But as a studio owner and certified instructor from the New York School, I see a growing division between traditional Pilates (the way Joseph Pilates originally created his method) and variations of traditional Pilates. This DVD is a depiction of nontraditional Pilates. The exercise orders are not Joseph Pilates' original exercise orders, there is not a seamless flow between exercises, and there is music playing. Joseph Pilates did not play music because each exercises has its own rhythm, dynamic, and tempo to be determined by the instructor during a given lesson.It is important to protect the public interest by labeling products properly. Most other professions have a state licensing board to protect the public interest, but the art and practice of the Pilates method does not. To properly describe this video, perhaps video producers should call this workout a Pilates-based exercise routine."
1,Really Fat Burning?,"Here is an important fact: when someone first starts learning Pilates, it is NOT possible to burn fat. There's just too much to learn at the beginning of your Pilates studies, so your heart rate and respiraiton rate do not have an opportunity to rise above certain levels. Even for $11 plus change, this video cannot achieve what its title indicates.This is just a Pilates mat video; it does not include Pilates equipment. The Pilates equipment helps your muscles work more deeply and vigorously (when first learning the method) until you understand the method well enough to complete an intermediate or advanced mat routine. When you can perform an intermediate or advanced Pilates mat workout proficiently, THEN you can get your heart rate up and gradually burn fat.After giving this DVD a close look, I have to say that Fat Burning Pilates cannot deliver on the claim explicit in its title."
2,Odd,"This dvd is odd. I am a huge Ellen Barrett fan but this was a no go for me. Firstly, what's with the drums? There is a man playing bongos (or something like that) throughout the entire dvd. It's not relaxing at all. Secondly, it incorporates a lot of aerobics. If you are looking for a pilates dvd and you like Ellen, try the one in in the crunch series where she is wearing the pink outfit."
4,Cardio plus challenging mat moves,"The first 25 min of this tape offers a cardio routine w/ pilates inspired moves. You WILL feel it, especially in the obliques. The second part, mat work, was a little challenging after doing all the floor work. I will admit that when I first got the tape I found the first segment (25 min aerobic inspired pilates) to be enough for me but now I can do it all. I consider myself to be an advanced beginner. An intermediate to advanced practitioner may not find it as challenging and rewarding as I did.Overall its a great tape. As with every other CRUNCH workout I've seen, the instructor is good and likeable. None of that yelling from the other ladies in the background.There is a live drummer adding a nice layer of extra rhythm to the music. He is in no way distracting or annoying. I think he lends a bit of energy to the workout and to the set.Overall, this is a pretty nice workout. Its one of my favorites."
1,Disappointing,"This was aerobics--not much of pilates and it didn't seem like there was any real blend of dance--just aerobics with a little pilates movement. There are some pilates moves in the end but the title of this video should not include the word pilates as it is misleading.My biggest problem with this video (besides the false advertising) is that there wasn't much explanation of the moves. What made it worse was the video editing. On many exercise changes the camera was focused on the ""Crunch"" sign, the hand drummer, or up-close on the instructor or one of the others on the video--you can't see what their legs and arms are doing. If I could, I would send this back. I am just going to stick with my Windsor Pilates tapes (the best!) and my Pilates classes at the local gym."
4,Good when fresh,This is a tasty on the go snack if you are lucky enough to get good fresh batch. The last bunch I got wasnt as enjoyable as I was used to. I realised it was because it lacked crunch. Would buy it again though. Great guilt free snack. Great for kids too.
4,Yummy!,"These are sweet and crunchy and I love them. My only concern is the price. At a dollar a piece, it's a little more than my buget allows for a snack. Luckily one packet is usually big enough for me to split for my kids."
4,very informative,the book is very helpful..and i recommend it to anyone who chooses to use healing herbs...as a way of healin......
5,A must have !,"Excellent book to have handy right when you just need to pull out those herbs, remedies that really work against many different diseases. It has a lot information and shows you how to even make those remedies."
5,Great watch - great price,"I love retro style watches and this one fits the bill perfectly. I bought it and the one with the white face and brown strap, so I can wear the one that suits my clothing and mood. It looks great and I get a lot of complments with whichever watch I'm wearing. It's price is easy on the pocket book, too."
2,My review,"This watch company needs to improve quality control. First watch I got didn't work properly and second watch did. First one was made in Japan and second one was made in Phillipines. So, Don't know what to say but definite improvement needed."
3,Loud,"Good Price. Looks nice. However, it ticks really loud. I cannot even have it in the bedroom and night. Ya, its that loud."
5,Classic,"This Timex is perfect for my daily living. The design is classically beautiful, the high-quality leather wrist strap is comfortable, the large, white numbers are easy to read, and the best feature of all is the square date window at the bottom of the face. The illuminating numbers is the second best feature. The time and date of everyday is paramount for living a detailed and performance life. This Timex is mine, thank you."
4,"A Classic, Dependable Piece","Most of the buying public knows that Timex is a dependable time piece. This watch is no exception. Despite the fact that they are now manufactured in China, this seems to ""keep on ticking"" as the old advertisement used to say.I bought this watch for my husband for Father's Day. He usually wears a sport watch because he needed the features for his work but the old sporty ""workhorse"" watch just didn't cut it with a suit and tie. This watch is beautiful for a dressy occasion and is just so classic looking that it could easily be mistaken, at quick glance, for a more expensive timepiece. It is simple, accurate. An excellent value for an occasional watch. We were both quite satisified with the purchase."
2,Turned out to be killers,"I thought these shoes fit well and initially they seemed comfortable. I was happy with their appearance and quality, but after I wore them for only a short time, I had two big blisters on one heel. Maybe it's just my feet, but these turned out to be killers. So painful I'm afraid to try to break them in."
3,Steeped in Mystery,"Stonehenge & the Ancient Britons focuses mainly on 3-D computer graphics and speculation about how Stonehenge was built. This DVD also goes into more detail about the initial structures before they built what we see today.It is amazing to think this is older than the great pyramid at Geza and additional stone circles are presented, although no real explanation is given as to why they were built. The most intriguing aspect was the discussion of the warm bluestone from the Preseli mountains in Wales.If anything, this DVD presents even more questions and may make you even more curious.~The Rebecca Review"
3,change the title!!,"While the writing is good and the stories are interesting, saltwater fly fisherman share a ""snootiness"" that is a bit off-putting to us guys who are quite content with our ""boat rods"".The title of the book and/or cover ought be changed to indicate it is a fly fishing book, in my opinion. Of course, the market is much smaller and no doubt the author and publisher considered this when deciding on a title. And, the price ... is a bit out of whack as well."
1,Avoid this piece of crap,This trap worked ok for the first few months. I then ran into another guy at our club using the same model and he warned me about the welds on the throwing arm breaking. I was hoping that maybe he just got a defective unit but sure enough mine broke in the same spot a few weeks later. It also managed to slice my hand open as the arm broke off its pivot point and whacked me. We'll see what the company does to repair it but I have a good feeling that the shipping charges to send this junk back will be more than the thrower is worth. This is typical made in china junk. You get what you pay for. Fool me once......
2,It's a pain in the butt to assemble,"This ""kit"" reminds me of Ikea furniture. Instructions incomplete, poor pictures. Tool provided are junk, and you need more. Things that could clean up the design were overlooked, just the first cNoUt and bolt and two pieces of the frame required me to disassemble 4 times due to the poor instructions. I haven't used it yet, but hope it will work fine.Again, a reall pain to build, and yes I do n"
4,Memorex MD5480CP Personal Cd Player,I think that the Memorex player is a good cd player because it has a long playback time even on regular AA batteries.It also has a wide range of features that include extra bass.This is the perfect gift for those on the go because it was quite simply ....built for it.A good Purchase all in all due to the price
2,"Simple, but some advice outdated","I enjoyed some of the descriptions and easy to understand terms used to explain some of the more sensitive subjects that most parents are uncomfortable with. I do, however, believe some of her discussions about social and emotional issues were lacking and in some ways, outdated. A particular example of this is her explaining what to do about coping with bullys. I found it appalling that in this day in age, her advice is to warn the bully you will strike back, and then do so upon further harassment by the bully. ""Take one final swoop"" and then go find a grown up. Sounds like an outdated mode of coping, one that in today's society would get you suspended from school, at the least, fatally wounded at the worst. Made me question some of her other explanations about similar issues."
4,"Great Little book for those ""hard-to-answer"" questions",My wife & I found this one in a bookstore and thought it was a great book... for those truly interesting questions that invariably kids will ask...Perfect for any parent with inquistive kids...
5,Peter Book Worm,"He's on edge of slipping to the other side(chaos)but holds on for a great ending,also a new beginning for Ravenor(next set future -I- style books.Great Book/Glad i didnt buy all 3 seperate.Peter"
3,"Display great, back and band - not so much","I have had this watch for about two years. All the watch functions work fine. I like the display and look.The band, however, while looking good, is not durable. It breaks where the buckle/clasp is at. The combofabric/leather layer band , and large holes for the buckle tang, make for a very weak point.And to make it worse, the band has a unique way to connect to the case with interlocking plastic/rubber tabs, and 2 screwws.I have yet to find a replacement band anything like this.Last, the back seems to bother (skin develops a rash) my skin more than my other watches - it statesstainless but perhaps there are different grades of stainless backs."
3,Not as useful as hoped.,"It helped with distinguishing between beef, chicken, fish and stuff but it was not what I hoped this guide would be....I like the Rick Steve books a bit better when traveling to different countries."
4,Book,This book was very interesting to read. The author did a great job of telling about her life as a slave and afterwards. She also shared insights into the Lincoln family.
5,Thirty years a slave,Excellent book about the history of Elizabeth Keckley. She seems to be the only person that stood by Mrs. Lincoln.
3,Almost a Good Christmas Album,"I'd like this collection a lot better if it weren't for the song interpretations of three of the most overrated female singers of the last twenty years: Madonna, Stevie Nicks, and Whitney Houston.The track I find particularly annoying is Houston's version of ""Do You Hear What I Hear?"", which asks the musical question of why she can't sing a song the way it's written. A truly awful interpretation of one of the most beloved Christmas songs of all time."
1,Not worth buying,"I bought the cd for my sister, because it was the only recording I could find of this particular Sting song that she loved. It turned out she already had the cd, and said the ONLY good song on the cd was his song. Therefore I took it back to another store, as I didn't want it either. Too much discordant, and rap type music, she said."
5,Growning up with' A Very Special Chriatmas',"Every Christmas Eve that I can remember my dad has played this cd, & now no other cd (other than a Rosie Donalds Chirstmas)can come close to getting me really into the Chirstmas sprirt. Many of the songs are wonderful randitions of old classics. This is a MUST MUST MUST buy!!"
4,Old Favorite,"The original ""A Very Special Christmas"". I remember buying the LP when it first came out and loved it so much that I decided to get the CD recently. Still a classic. Great Album."
4,Lots of frequently heard holiday songs,"I ordered this to finally get recordings of many of the holiday songs I hear each year. For the price, it was a good find and a much better deal than downloading individual songs. There are few ones I press the skip button on, but overall most songs are ones that have become perennial holiday favorites."
1,So disappointed!,"I expected to love this...or at the very least, like it. I hate it! I can hardly believe how MUCH I hate it. I kept skipping to the next song, to find one I liked...did not happen. Maybe its because I really love Christmas music...traditional Christmas music, the Beach Boys Christmas album, and lots of others I already own. Guess I should have known better...but it had such rave reviews! It went in the trash the same day it arrived."
4,Very special christmas,"Great cd, have the original on record & couldn't find it anywhere in Oz on cd. Not your traditional boring christmas carols - love it!"
3,Good but Volume 2 is Better,"While I think it's terrific that alot of old chestnuts are revived and modernized in this collection, I find the second volume more pleasant, better songs and better performed than the first. Actually, you ought to get both!!"
4,the best of the series,"To me, the first time is always the best. In this series of Christmas charity albums I mean. However, I am horrified at the other reviewers who repeatedly state that the best tracks on the album are Madonna's version of Santa Baby (please - Eartha Kitt where are you), and Stevie Nicks' Silent Night (sung like she is going to fall asleep - and I like Stevie Nicks). Whitney Houston is alright but come on - The Pretenders' version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Sting's Gabriels Message and Alison Moyet's Coventry Carol are by far the best tracks on the album (in my humble opinion of course)."
2,Dissappointed,One bad thing about ordering something like this is you can't see what the content is. This was not what I expected at all.
5,It is a very special Christmas,"The cd, ""A Very Special Christmas"" is a great cd with great artists. Each of the songs is sung by well know singers, a must buy..."
5,A Very Special Christmas 2,This is one of my all time favorite Christmas CD's. I recently bought this on here as a replacement for the one I have had for years that had become scratched beyond repair. Listening to it always puts me in the holiday spirit :)
5,GREAT Christmas CD,"I got this CD when I was about 15 years old... still have it 20 years later. It is a wonderful Christmas CD. I love the heart and soul these artists have poured into these songs. Each year when I hear them, it takes me back to specials times. I HIGHLY recommend it. Whether you're 15 or 50..."
3,A Very Special Christmas cd,"I have always loved this tape, and now I am so happy I finally have it on cd. It includes some hard-to-find gems like: Sting's ""Gabriel's Message"", and Alison Moyet's ""Coventary Carol"". I love it!"
3,Disposable Shoes -- But Versatile & Stylish,"These shoes come with extra heel covers -- and with good reason. Within 6 weeks of purchase (probably 8 wearings) the heels were virtually destroyed. I live in the city and specifically purchased these because the low kitten heels are more conducive to a city lifestyle -- I walk a lot in the course of my commute and work day. These shoes are NOT made for walking - they just don't hold up.The fit: It's a bit narrow - buying a half size up might be wise. Otherwise pretty comfortable.Appearance: They are quite stylish and the black leather pair is very versatile.Bottom Line: If the price reflected the shoe's lack of longevity, I'd have no problem ordering another pair. But Amazon's current price of $50 is just too much for disposable shoes."
1,Beware!,"Obviously, whether you like this book or not will depend on what you want to hear. Those who are looking for justification for the reconciliation of homosexual practices with the Christian faith will probably be pleased with this book, at least part of it. However, it should be noted that as I recall the author has been removed from the Roman Catholic priesthood since the publication of this book. In addition, potential readers should be aware that this book not only defends homosexual practices but at least implies a defense of pederasty. It claims that Christ approved of a sexual relationship between a Roman centurion and his servant who was likely only a boy. I think few on either side of the homosexual debate in the Church will welcome this interpretation, particularly coming from a former priest in light of recent events."
1,Not Convinced,The Bible reveals the character and purpose of God.The Broken Image by Leanne Payne was much more helpful to me.
5,Should be required reading for every Christian,"Great book, easy for the non-expert to follow. Takes every reference to homosexuality in the Bible, discusses them one by one.Turns out that New Testiment opposition to homosexuality depends entirely on the translation of the Greek word arsenokoitai, a word that apparently was never used by a non-Christian writer.Thank you Dr. Helminiak."
5,"Clear, Concise, Comprehensive.","I bought an earlier edition of Dr. Helminiak's book and this new edition, available on Kindle as well, is even better.It hits all the ""clobber passages"" and points out self-apparent things in the Bible that many miss (like, Jesus never said anything against homosexuality, generally or specifically, AND the Biblical writers never said anything against homosexual LOVE).It is scholarly, yet an easy read (easy enough for a high school graduate). And, I advise putting all the versions of the Bible you have at hand, you will want to read the context of quoted scripture yourself.This is a MUST HAVE for a Christian Parent, Loved One, or Friend of someone who ""came out""."
4,"A nice try, but ...","A nice try and some interesting arguments. It's always good to have more means of parrying the blows of homophobic Christians. But I can't help feeling that if the Bible really were the word of God, it would be much clearer and kinder to gay people, and that the better solution would be to leave the Bible behind.Natasha HolmeAuthor of 'Lesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder'"
5,Gave new insight to the controversy surrounding homosexuality,"As a GLBT adocate & a new Christian, I was really struggling with the issue of homosexuality. This book really helped me to reconcil the 2. It gave new insight to the Bible passages that are used against homosexuality. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in homosexuality and/or the Bible."
2,"Hum, which Bible is this man reading?",This author is twisting what the Bible states about homosexuality. A real disappointment. Read the Bible and do the study yourself.
5,It will really open your eyes!,"This book was a wonderful read! Forget everything you've heard about what the Bible says about homosexuality because this book will really open your eyes and make you think. You won't be disappointed and you'll want to share it with your friends and family! If everyone read this book, I think the world be a much more friendly and hospitable place..."
4,"When you need an answer to""You should repent of your sin","Those who believe the Bible is the literal word of God, need to remember that it was written and translated by many people. If you are comfortable in your faith it will not be shaken by taking a further look at the story of Lot and Sodom, and St. Paul's letters. Remember that Paul also told women to be silent in church and slaves to obey their masters. You might want to read ""From Wounded Hearts..."" Each of the fifty chapters is written by people of faith who struggled with homosexuality in themselves or someone they loved. Available from Amazon.com"
3,Not quite exhaustive but somewhat exhausting,"While this book shines in its thoroughness, it fails to make a cohesive argument as a whole. Often several pages are spent examning the smallest of details of a Biblical passage, yielding a very insubstantial conclusion when a more concise and incontrovertible argument could be made more easily.Additionally, the author often takes a very patronizing tone towards Biblical literalists, and wastes a lot of time explaining why Biblical literalism is simply wrong. This tone, which starts with the foreword by Shelby Spong, would be an instant turn-off to those who need to hear the message most.While I would recommend this book to those wanting to broaden their knowledge, I would not recommend it to conservative Christians questioning their sexuality, nor to their families. Instead, I recommend The Children Are Free by Jeff Miner, et al. It is far more concise, respectful, and convincing."
2,A disappointment,"I came to this book hoping that Helminiak would provide a reasoned basis to disregard what seemed like pretty strong Biblical language indicating that homosexuality is disfavored. I was disappointed. He's quite persuasive on the Old Testament texts, but his analysis of the New Testament prohibitions is unpersuasive and internally inconsistent."
3,Great Series,thought the series was great when i was a kid.and still think so now.but where is the movie version from 1970!
5,The Cold Hard Truth,"Let's be honest: if I watched this show growing up, I would probably be doing crystal meth right now. Not gonna lie."
3,"If you didn't grow up with it, you're better off without it","H.R. Pufnstuf is the precursor to PeeWee's Playhouse, Zoobolie Zoo, Spongebob Squarepants, and basically every kids' show that looks like the writers used chemical sources of inspiration. If you enjoy the any of the shows I just mentioned, Pufnstuf sounds cool but really isn't all it's cracked up to be. Once you get past the bizarre and colorful imagery of the show, the series itself is pretty boring, with none of the wit that the shows it later influenced added. In other words, one or two episodes is really enough; after that you'll understand why parents never watched this show with their kids.Of course, if you grew up watching the show, it has an entirely different meaning to you. But if you're just interested in cult TV, keep watching PeeWee and Spongebob and know that you're not missing anything."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I remember this programme from my youth - however only vaguely. When I saw it for sale on Amazon.com I had to buy it as I wanted to remember more. I was expecting it to be nothing like I remembered as I have seen some of the old programmes from my youth and they have been nothing like I remembered them. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it was exactly as I remembered it.I had forgotten a couple of the characters like Cling and Clang and Ludicrous Lion and of course there were my favourites, Witchiepoo on her broom broom and Freddie the Flute and Jimmy and HR Puffnstuff.It was a trip down nostalgia lane and I loved every minute of it.Many thanks.Chris."
5,Love it!,"I was so excited to finally get this DVD set! I always watched HR Pufnstuf as a child, and now I can share it with my grandchildren! All the episodes together makes the perfect set!"
4,Do you remember?,"Do you remember when you had to wait for Saturday morning for cartoons? If you do, you'll probably enjoy this collection. It's like stepping into the way back machine."
1,WHERE IS THE PUFNSTUF,"I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM PERIOD, LET ALONE GET IT ON THE SCHEDULED DAY. WHO DO I SPEAK WITH TO TRACK THE PACKAGE I DO NOT HAVE?"
5,"Great Show, Great Memories","If you grew up watching H.R. Pufinstuf, this is a must have. All the memories come flooding back. Not only that, but many of the jokes are even funnier now that I'm an adult. The comentary options on the videos provide fascinating insight into the creator's minds and make watching the shows that much beter once you know what was going on behind the scenes.Given the many levels of humor you can share these episodes with others who never got the chance to watch this show when they were children. The humor still carries.Its just good, funny, tasteful humor that never goes out of style.I highly recommend this set."
5,Just like I remembered,It was great revisiting all the strange but enjoyable characters again.My granddaughter loved the shows.It's refreshing to see a show that let's a kid be a kid.The theme song will stick in your head but a least its enjoyable.
4,Cool box design,"This company did a great job in the packaging of this set, the Pufnstuf bobblehead is in its own packaging which allows it to be placed separately from the dvd set for display.The video quality is the same as the the Rhino set i purchased years ago, only difference is with this set you do not get the complete opening sequence, the shots where Jimmy is running down the hill then spots the ship etc etc, on this set it starts after he is rescued and carries on from there.The bonus episode which features a segment from the Krofft Supershow called Horror Hotel is fun,,,it being a segment only lasts about 12 minutes, all in all it's fun and stars some of the characters from different shows including a Hoodoo look-a-like, who did a REALLY good job!"
2,"Beware: The Incomplete ""Complete"" Series","Unless you are too young to remember, TV shows in the 80's, 70's, 60's, and 50's were NOT 21 minutes long! They ranged anywhere from 23 minutes in the early 80's to 25+ minutes in the 50's and 60's. These shows (clocking in at just over 21 minutes are *obviously* a surreptitious packaging of the syndicated series as re-released by Nick At Night. Beware. They did this with Alf and without ANY warning about it. I don't know what's missing from these shows: it's been too long. But Alf lost some of its funniest lines thanks to the re-editing. Very sad. :("
5,"Who's Your Friend,when Things get Rough?","I first saw this on Pufapaloosa on Nick,and I loved it. I would love to have the whole series on DVD."
2,Psysiology coloring workbook,This book is not what I expected. I ended up using a different coloring book to learn from.
4,the Mio Shape Select is awesome!,"I love being able to take my heart rate in seconds without having to wear a chest strap.The watch is easy to program, easy to use, easy to read- even in the dark or underwater with the backlight.The calorie counter is also very helpful (and motivating!)The only delta is that even though I ordered it in the petite size, the face of the watch is still rather large and at times slightly uncomfortable to wear because the large watch face limits wrist movement."
4,My Heart Rate monitor watch,"I really love it. The band can be a little uncomfortable. I haven't figured out how to track calories burned yet, but I am working on it. It is awesome for making sure I stay on track with my heart rate when I am working out. It is a lot easier than trying to count my own heart rate over the sound of my treadmill or bike going. I like the fact that I don't have to strap anything around me either."
4,MioPINK is cool,"I really like this watch. It's a little big larger than I expected, but I like the instant pulse readout and timer features. Kinda pricey... but I guess you get what you pay for, and overall, it's a great product."
2,mio pink watch,"The band is not made for small wrist women, it's made for children. It does not always pick up your heartrate. It's difficult to use since you have to take your heart rate during your workout. Not impressed"
4,Not bad for a beginner device,"I bought this watch for my wife and for the most part she is happy. The heart monitor feature is a little shaky. I have been walking with her several times when she has tried to use it while still walking with no success. Most times you need to stop in order for it to read, and even then sometimes no. It is very feminine looking and is an overall good watch. I wish it would add and subtract calories for her, but she said sometimes it does and most times it doesn't. Good price,and decent functions for an overall four star rating."
3,not quite what I had hoped,"The product is very big and bulky. It fit around my small wrist but I ended up taking it out of the band and using it like a pocket watch. Unless you have the setting positions memorized this can get confusing as they are not labeled on the watch itself. I tried taking my pulse while I was exercising. I had to stand still for it to register. Which is a bummer if you want to see how high your pulse is. My resting pulse seemed to change every time I took it, even if I was not doing anything different. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,A Stopwatch will work better,"Though the concept of a Heart Rate Monitor without a chest strap sounds convenient, the MIO is of absolutely no use during your workout. You have to stop your activity (be it running, biking or walking) to measure your current Heart rate, as your hand has to be steady. The calories feature does not measure the calories burned accurately and was off almost by 100 calories."
1,"Not so ""heart rate monitor""",What a complete waste of money! I received this as a gift... Tried it out for a couple days - did quite a few workouts with it... I couldn't get a heart rate reading EVER!!! What is the point of having it if I can't pick up a beat? Don't bother... Even the feature about tracking calories and such - way too much work and wasteful. Just get a regular monitor that goes around your chest and a little notebook for a food diary. This watch was a waste!
3,Petite for whom??,"This watch is definitely not discrete. It is HUGE! I mean, I am embarassed to wear it in public. I only wear it while running. I don't know where these MIO people got the idea of Petite from but basically, it has a shorter strap and a HUGE face like those 80s style Swatch watches. If you're into that, you may like it, but it's just not cool to wear daily. Think of the size of those old dollar coins on your wrist, but 3/4 inches thick, that's the face of this watch, a big honkin' pink and black vinyl face."
2,If Only It Worked,"I had been researching watches with heart rate monitors for a while before settling on the Mio. It had everything that I wanted and I loved that there was no strap to wear! However, that might also be this product's biggest flaw. The petite size fits my wrist nicely and all of the stopwatch and timer functions are great, but it refuses to give me my heart rate unless I'm standing perfectly still (and have been for a while). This watch will not measure my heart rate while I'm exercising or walking. Even getting a reading immediately after a walk is difficult. I thought about returning it, but still need a stopwatch for workouts, so decided to keep it. Still, I had been hoping for something so much more. Not exactly the product that I had imagined. If you need a watch that will give you a reading during a workout, this isn't the product for you!"
4,Teenage mutant ninja turtle comforter,"fast shipping, always a plus!!! Wish this comforter was softer but beautiful colors that haven't faded at all."
5,"Light, Super Grippy, Good Quality Grips","These grips are awesome for the price. The black on red looks sweet, though I wish the red were slightly more vibrant.. they look exactly as they do in the picture. The grip is impressive and used in combination with my Fox gloves, I can't see how its possible to slip off your handlebar. They installed very easily and don't budge at all after being installed. I am always concerned with the covered ends on inexpensive grips, thinking that they will tear up easily after a fall or two.. but these are tough! The small ""knobs"" that provide grip feel pretty good after long rides, so i've yet to find anything to complain about with these. Definitely get a set and check em out!"
1,Broken Already !!!!!!!!!,"I bought a brand new JVC (model GR-D70U) mini DV digital video camera less than 2 years ago. I have used it about 25 times and now it's broken. Every time I turn it on to record it says ""Lens Cap"" as in remove lens cap. It still plays previously recorded tapes but I can't record anything because the screen is black. This is my first JVC camcorder and my LAST. I am presently looking to buy another camcorder as I am missing my baby's first steps among other things."
1,Total product failure within 9 months,I purchased this product less than nine months ago and probably only used it about six times. When I went to use it the last (and final time) the playback of the recording was distorted and broken up with lines. I used a cleaning cassette as recommended in the manual but it did not help. The JVC Authorized Service Provider diagnosed a defective main PC board which will run me $150 of labor to repair. The part is still under warranty. I contacted JVC about my problem with the unit but they were unresponsive and appear not to stand by their product. I would never purchase another JVC item again.
2,recorded camera noise,"I just purchased this JVC GRD93 camera elsewhere, and recorded my first short video on a new JVC tape. While the camera itself didn't seem to make a lot of noice, the camera noice recorded on the tape was very annoying during playback. JCV customer service was of no help. I'm sending the camera back."
2,GRD93 Just Quit Working,"I bought the JVC GRD93 Dec 21, 2004. After a day of charging the battery, I opened the camera and replaced the tape in it with a new one and headed off to the soccer match. When I got there it would not come on. I returned home, tried another battery, plugged it back into the charger and nothing. No power, tape will not eject. Similar to problem reported elsewhere by others. Pretty pathetic to have a $500 camera not even last two years."
1,Don't Buy A JVC,"I purchased a GR-D70 2 years ago. Last week it quit for no reason at all. I've probably used it 10 times. It looks like brand new, well taken care of, never dropped or abused. Since I paid over $400 for it, and it's had such little use, I thought JVC would stand behind their product. WRONG! Their recommendation is to have you ship it to a service center, pay an unreal amount for repair, and hope it lasts another 2 years. I have never paid so much for a new camera and have it totally fail in 2 years. After much research I find quite a number of people with similiar and other failures on a multitude of JVC Digital cameras. My recommendation is to not buy ANY JVC products! Thank you."
4,Great Older Model Mini DV,"This Mini DV is a great low priced camcorder. I got it refurbished for under $150. The still photo feature has a much higher resolution than even some of the newer camcorders in the same category (1600x1200 instead of 640k). It handles well and the 10x optical zoom, though vastly inferior for todays standards, is more than adequate for our purposes. The battery lasts pretty good, but doesn't give much of a warning before it loses power completely. Other than that, we are very satisfied with it."
1,Model GR-D30U,"I've owned a model GR-D30U for less than two years. Yesterday the camcorder just quit powering on. The DC will not work, the battery will not charge. It simply will not turn on at all. Worse, I have a tape in there that I cannot remove without a hammer. The store I bought it from wants $100 just for ""diagnosis."" Just another case of expensive disposable electronics. My choice next time will not be JVC, a brand I used to trust."
4,Very good! Different than their first album,"Excellent follow-up to The Sand, The Barrier. I'd probably say a bit more radio accessible this time around. Very original stuff!!"
5,thumping&grooving,from the funk of stomp to the smoothness of this had to be with the king of pop michael jackson and the strong production of the man quincy jones The brothers johnson rock on light up the night.rod temperton is featured on this disc with his genius of song-writing.and they groove on guitar&bass as only they could.in your face.a solid album.
4,a banging album,"dug the title track and the interlock groove that Brothers George and Louis have on here with there harmonys. the Grooves are slamming. Stomp was a beast of a Jam and the solo ain't no joke. the King of Pop the One and Only Michael Jackson Co Wrote the uptempo jam ""this had to Be"" with the Brothers Johnson. this was my last fave album from the Brothers Johnson. Thunder Thumps Louis Johnson throws down on the Bass. george johnson has his smooth guitar licks and vocals.cool album from start to finish."
5,An enthralling odyssey of human striving,"Dreams of the Solo Trapeze is the memoir of one man's amazing journey alongside trapeze artists Olga Sidorova, as he sees firsthand the globe-trotting experience of the Cirque du Soleil. From Amsterdam to Barcelona to London, Montreal and Las Vegas. Witnessing firsthand the demands of art, physical conditioning, high-stakes performance, competition, candor, and love, Dreams of the Solo Trapeze is an enthralling odyssey of human striving and the secret lives of performers in the spotlight. Highly recommended."
5,Good Kids Bible,"We use this Bible in our Sunday School classes, ages 7-11. It is easy for them to read and understand, and has many useful ""helps"" and answers for inquisitive kids. Unfortunately this edition is now out of print by the publisher, Tyndale, so I have had to order from various sources who are listed on Amazon. I even bought one for $1.00! New ones from the publisher are outrageously priced--over $38.00--but slightly used ones are reasonably priced, especially for those of us on a Sunday School budget! I wish the publisher would bring them back--they have hard covers and can take a lot of use."
1,Quite Unsatisfied,"The book arrived wrapped in very dirty buble wrap. The book itself was badly stained and dusty and dirty. The edges of the pages were badly stained. The book was advertised by the seller as being NEW. It was not new at all. I felt mislead by the seller's advertising and am still waiting for a return mailing label so I can return it. Several weeks have passed, but no label. Terrible customer service and terrible quality! I will not order anything from this seller again."
2,Kid-friendly Bible,"We give this bible to all our third graders. Then we hold a class for third graders and their parents where they work together to discover all the ""special effects"" that attract kids to this particular bible. The kids end up loving their new bibles!"
4,It's the one I've always used.,"I only gave it 4 stars, because I here there are better nutritous ferret foods, but they seem to be twice the price. I urge any ferret food to be accompanied with natural foods ferrets would eat in the wild though, such as eggs and fruits-no sugars!"
1,read the labels,High protein kitten food is the same as ferret food Read the labels just like the ferret litter that's made out of Recycled newspaper. Make your own decisions it's cheaper
3,What it is good for,"I bought this book because of the ratings and was disappointed. Yes it does give chronological information on planning and basics on drawing and a lot of info on working therater designs and with others. Great, but not what I needed. It also has a great reference section for doing the research you need to do but, I already had most of this info from other sources. I have a history and arts background and i needed inspiration. It did give me an inspiration to reorganize my art supplies!Don't waste your money if you are not theater oriented. AND I do mean theater."
4,a book for the theatre,"This book unfortunately was not what I wanted. However, this book is extremely detailed, and for somebody who is interested in stage or theatre costumes, very helpful in pointing the steps required to design the types of costumes for specific productions.I wanted a book to help me create costumes ie more of a pattern book.Amazon very difficult to deal with if not in Amercia"
2,dissapointing resource for costume creation,"I bought this text as a required reading for a theater class and can't tell you what a disappointment it was for me. I was looking for really specific help on costume creation and construction as applied to period themes and body types. I wanted to find ways to make costumes that were more adaptable and easy to wear and move in.This book is filled with lists and management strategies for the costumer. One section covers dealing with actors, directors and other stage and set staff. For the person running the costume corner of the theater, this book has forms and file lists for setting up the perfectly efficient shop. For the creative person looking to fashion an awesome costume design...this book does nothing but give her a list of other books that might contain the construction and creation and fitting info she is looking for.Too frustrating...!"
2,Missing key tracks,Where's Jammin'? Where's One Cup of Coffee? No woman No cry?Good tunes but I see why it's so inexpensive.
4,"Worthwhile, but a movie is not a book","""Jeremiah"" works pretty well as a biopic. It does what a movie has to do, simplifying and providing a central narrative thread. It shows Jeremiah's struggles, and gives samples of his message. It touches on his great themes, including the possibility of repentance and God's wonderful promises in the New Covenant.Violence was part of Jeremiah's message and life, and we see plenty: perhaps more than necessary, though I can't recall seeing any blood. This is not a movie for young children.To judge from a translation, much of Jeremiah's message was delivered in striking, often moving *poetry*. The poetry does not come across in the movie. Maybe, just maybe, great visual poetry would have helped.On a personal note, I wish that they had used an existing classical choral setting of the biblical book of Lamentations during the closing credits."
3,"Liked it, but disappointed","I liked this video, but I was disappointed by the fairly flagrant disregard for Biblical record. It takes a lot of liberty. In general it is in keeping with the theme and there are none of the tawdry plots so often introduced. Good scenery, pretty good acting, little scriptural truth."
4,Very Good,"I give it a thumbs ups review. It's a movie - not the Bible. A good over view, but read the book of Jeremiah there is so much more."
4,Jeremiah,"This Bible movie does contain some inaccuracies, but for the most part it's dead on. I feel it's well made. Patrick Dempsey does a great job in the role of Jeremiah. I like the production qualities. The beautiful locations look so authentic. I highly recommend this one."
5,Inspiring,"I actually saw the French Version of this Video in Ivory Coast, but it was still incredible. Of this series, Jeremiah is the most inspiring. This film does a great job of showing the pain and suffering which Jeremiah went through. Very Professionally done. Made for TV type series. Does a great job of showing the pain and torture that Jeremiah went through. His persistence is encouraging."
3,Leap of Faith,"A bit of a leap from the Biblical record of Jeremiah, but still nicely done. It will do for teaching the story to your children or grandchildren."
4,Jeremiah the Prophet,"It was a very good video. In the beginning was tough to follow, but got very exciting in the end."
1,Jeremiah,"The quality of the DVD was extremely low, it could not be watch because half of it was at a very high speed and the other was all lines"
1,search you`re self,"rather then looking at this movie read or listen to the bible, here in this movie god is potray as a litle girl tha`s a one of the bigges sin, and abomination, the bible tell us god hinself call him to be a prophet not the angel of the lord nor a litle girl, is to much that people are cursing god all the time on movies of hollywood, and on tv and all type of sin been happening and trying to twis true ( only the wise will understand )."
4,The Bible - Jeremiah,"This is a great film! I watched it several times. I urge everyone to watch it. Although I did not like the producers' inclusion of Jeremiah's supposed ""female"" friend....Above all, it was great! When you are through, check yourself and reflect on your life. Jeremiah was not a weeping prophet for nothing. The Lord spoke through him and warned the people. Do not become complacent and forget about it. Instead, open your Bible and read the whole book of Jeremiah. Learn a thing or two from it! ""God created people to be upright, but they have each turned to follow their own downward path."" (Ecclesiastes 7:29 NLT) God bless you all!"
5,Fantastic,"Jeremiah is good as a movie, biblical in context, movies have to insert things that are not in the bible to make the movie more comercially atractive, but overall if you read the book of Jeremiah,you will notice that the biblical things exposed are adecuate."
4,Jeremiah,"Of 'The Bible' series by Lube Productions, this has to be one of their finest. The scene where Jeremiah, who at the start of his priestly ministry, prophesied to the assembled worshippers and the dissolute King was one of the most profound I have seen. Patrick Dempsey is well cast for his role as the unflinching prophet who contends with spirital apostasy, political intrigue and the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. (One can only speculate, but I would dearly like to see a film made by Lube about Elijah!). This film is a worthy addition to the video library of anyone who likes Biblical dramas. Care and attention was paid to historical and Biblical accuracy, without the sleaze and 'extra-curricular' activities indulged by many earlier films about the Bible."
5,Excellent!,"Well done. Inspiring. Sobering. 'Jeremiah' does an excellent job at givng us a glimpse into what life for Jeremiah must have been like after God called him to be His prophet. This is not a cheesy attempt to put the Scriptures on film, but a professionally-done rendering of a complex Biblical character with a most difficult assignment from God. I highly recommend this film to everyone!"
5,Choo-Choo Train,"Adorable, bright, strong, and big train set! Larger than I imagined. I purchaed this for my new grandchild. I, myself, had 3 sons who had a train set similar to this but smaller. All 3 of them loved it and played with it for years. I'm hoping my grandchild gets as much joy and entertainment. This particular site offered it for $5 less than the Fisher Price site, (I am a comparison shopper). It arrived within 2 days!"
2,Scary for my baby,"Every time I bring this toy out, my daughter starts to cry. She doesn't like the music or the fact that it moves! The only time she gave it the briefest smile was when it was in its box. Ugh. Wishing I had saved my money."
5,Great investment!,"We purchased this circus train for several of our grandchildren and it is still in excellent conditon 5 years later, after use by siblings and half the neighborhood kids. An excellent investment since the animals are also individual playthings that make sounds."
2,Dont bother,"My son was afraid of it at first so we did not use it now he likes it and it plays the same annoying song every time.The worst part is that the song says ""tigers can run fast and hippos cannot""If i am spending money on a toy i want it to be educational but this toy gives false facts yes tigers can run fast but hippos can run fast too!!!"
4,Hours of fun!,"My daughter got this as a gift last year for Christmas. She played with it non stop and still does. She loves watching the train go and chasing it around. The volume control is a must have because it can be pretty loud. She doesn't usually put the animals in for a ride, it usually her favorite Taggie toy or her sippy cup. The batteries have just now worn out and need to be replaced. Even my friends two year old boy played with it. It's a great toy and I would recommend."
3,Animal train,"This toy looked like fun to me and my grandson has another toy that moves along the floor and makes various noises and he really liked that toy which is why I got this one for him. But my grandson was not that interested. When my other grandson is old enough to play with it, maybe he will like it."
4,Would buy another one !!,"I bought the ""sing and Go Choo Choo"" for my grandson (18 months). He absolutely loved it !! He couldremove the animals from the train and place them wherever he wanted. This toy kept him busy for atleast 20 minutes !! And the song is great and entertaining."
4,Fisher-Price Sing and Go Choo-Choo,"Bought this Choo-Choo for our grandson's first Christmas (8 1/2 months old at the time) and he immediately became one of his favorite toys. He loves to watch the train move on it's own, along with playing with each of the three animals to see what parts of them move. His favorite though is just pressing the buttons to make the train sing and light up."
5,my son is obsessed!,"I got this toy five months ago when my son was 4 mos old. He has been obsessed ever since. He will sit for HOURS and only wants to play with this train. I can't imagine what he would do without it. I am also impressed because with CONSTANT playing for five months, I only just replaced the batteries. I am going to buy this toy for every friend expecting a child."
2,Manufacturing defects,"We were excited to receive this toy as a gift, but the paint rubbed off in several blotches on the engine and the train would not move in ""move-along"" mode. Also, by the commercials it appeared to tell about whichever animal is in the front car- it does not. It just cycles through about 3 songs when you push down on the engine seat (which is too hard for a 6 mo. old to do). The smoke stack (the easiest for a baby to push down) only plays 1 song- so be prepared to learn it quickly and sing-along!We'll be exchanging ours for another in hopes that it will be without the defects before giving up on it completely."
5,Great Toy,We just got this for my 8 month old for Christmas and he loves it(my 2 yr old boys also like it as well). It moves great on carpet and on tile floors and he loves to crawl after it. The pieces of the animals move like their ears and legs. It also has some great learning songs about the animals. A great first train and first animals. Also you can add on extra animals and cars.
2,Mine didn't work right!,"I was so excited to give this to my 10 month old for Christmas. He loved it! However...it didn't work right. It's supposed to move in one mode and be stationary in the other. Ours moved no matter what position the swith was in. When we put the volume on the lower setting it couldn't be heard at all, you could only see the smokestack light up, but no sound. AND when placing animals in the engine in the front...NOTHING happened. We even tried pushing the panel down ourselves...didn't do anything. The box said it sang 5 songs...ours only sang one. Yes, I made sure the tag you have to remove to make it play in normal mode was completely removed, and I even put in brand new batteries. I returned it and got a new one. And guess what...this one does the same thing!"
4,Fun Toy!,"I bought this toy for my 1 yr old's birthday. She's having alot of fun with it. It's a toy that she can grow with. Right now she plays with the train in the stationary position, and I imagine as she gets older she'll want the train to move. It's very durable, she tosses the pieces all over! The sounds the toy makes are not nearly as annoying as some toys. ( Like a certain puppy she received!!!) I also felt the toy was a great value . It's one of the nices toys she has. I would recommend it!"
2,The Song Will Drive You Nuts,"My son never really got into this toy, which is ironic because he got like three of them for Christmas from various relatives, two of which we took back. He was only 6 months then, but is a year now and still doesn't really care about it. Maybe it's better for older kids as others have mentioned. The song it plays is nauseating at best. What is it with the voices on kids toys? Why is it a rule that if it is for a kid the voice has to be sickeningly obnoxious? My son likes soothing, normal sounding voices. He is weirded out by loud, annoying songs like that."
2,Another plastic noise maker with no purpose,"To be fair this toy has proved durable... and the animals that come with the train are posable, rugged and nicely designed... but the train is too loud with a very limited selection of annoying electronica music/singing. Not sure what kids could possibly learn from this toy. It looks ""cute"" and seems like a good idea... but has limited play potential... I'd suggest just buying some animals and a wood train and playing with those... the electronics don't add anything. Very typical of Fisher Price toys these days... all plastic with lots of pointless and annoying electronica music/singing and almost no educational element. Save your money and buy something quality elsewhere"
2,Not that great..,"In store, it looked neat & I was happy when my inlaws bought it for our son last Christmas when he was a newborn, but I figured by 6 months he'd be ready to enjoy it. I was wrong, as he's now a year old & still doesn't really care for it. The songs are catchy, it runs on carpet, but that's about it. The animals that come with it aren't really much of anything & have very little movememnt with them, my son actually isn't a fan of the clicking noise they make. He's enjoyed putting others things in the train, but that's about it. Doesn't seem to care about the music or the movement, even when we've showed him. Overall, it's one of those dreadful in the way toys that always end up under your feet. After Christmas, I look foward to finally being able to pack the train away just to have it out of the way."
1,Not engaging,"I purchased this toy for my six month old based upon the great reviews it received. My son who is now 9 months still has no desire to play with this toy. At first, he liked taking the animals off the train and putting them in his mouth but to be honest I have found that this toy has to be put away until he is more around 18 months. Then maybe he will like moving the train around the room but I doubt it. My son is more of an auditory and tactile person than visual. It was not worth the expense. The best toy out there are the rings that hard plastic rings that can link together and that are easy to carry with him and the soft toys he can put in his mouth. He plays more with my dogs Ty Dolls (beanie babies) because they have more texture varities to them than even the soft teethers for baby do. I hope this helps."
3,Not interactive enough to hold interest,"This toy looks great to parents. But in reality other than watching it go or mouthing the ears of the animals...what is there for children to do with it?I loved the clicking sounds the legs make, the materials they used to make it durable, and the colors are engaging. But the kids at my house usually just threw it aside to see what else there was to play with."
3,"Cute, but not used much!",I thought my son would love this toy. He was 6 months old and received 2 for Christmas last year. He has never shown much interest in it. Now he is 17 months and he still doesn't really play with it. I'm not sure why he doesn't care for this toy since he loves animals and trains. I will say that I think the toy is cute and it seems durable. Maybe he will play with it more as he gets older.
5,Durable and lots of fun,"The price must be listed incorrectly. I paid around $29.99 (on sale at Target) and it included the zebra too. My 9-mo old loves this train - she's played with it more than most toys she got for Christmas. Tha train has moveable parts and the animals have fun clicky parts and rubbery chewy parts too. She loves to chase after the train (also has a button so it won't move). My almost 3 year old loves playing with it too (more than the baby) so I know it's something she'll grow with. For the price I paid, it was one of the best buys we purchased this Christmas."
5,another great Fisher Price toy,My one year old loves the train and loves taking the animals everywhere to play. She loves to bang on it to make it drive and play music. This is one of her favorites! (Hearing the songs nonstop is making me crazy--but she is happy!)
3,Cute Idea - Big Let Down,"Although the idea behind this toy is exceptional, it's been a huge let down. It was purchased for Christmas for my 7 month old, and considering the price (we bought all of the additional animals) it's really disappointing. It plays the same song over and over again, the additional cars easily detach and after a very short time my daughter loses interest in the train - which is typical for her age. But she does like the animals and they are a great size for her to hold, especially the little ones that came along with the polar bear and monkey (although I took away the one small monkey because she can easily choke herself on the tail). Definitely wouldn't buy it again. I expected more ""bells and whistles"" because of the advertising and the price. In my opinion, Fisher Price took the cheap way out, this could have been a really cool toy. Hopefully her interest will be piqued as she gets older."
5,This was his favorite amongst the Christmas gifts,"My son is 6 months old and loves this train and the animals. He has interacted and played with this toy more than any other he received this Christmas. There is a nice variety of songs and the train moves enough to encourage him to go after it. The animals are cute and chunky enough for little hands to grab onto.I am amazed at the price that is now listed, but we thought it was well worth the price we payed originally.The no frills no hassle packaging was nice too but if I was giving it as a gift to anyone other than my own child, I think I'd prefer the traditional packaging for gift giving."
4,"lots of fun, but the tune gets stuck in your head","My 13 mo. old loves this train, and has since she got it at 8 mo. old. Like other reviewers, it works great on carpet. The animals are cute and make noise when you move their parts. My only complaint is that the tune gets stuck in my head, and there is no way to make it move without having it sing. I wish it just chugged along on an option of no singing, I'd enjoy it much better. My daughter, however, dances to the beat, so I just try to tune it out! I great purchase."
5,The Perfect Toy Train,"The train is very well constructed and durable with movable animal parts. The musical lyrics are easy to understand. If you add additional cars the train is not strong enough to pull them, but overall I am well pleased with the train."
2,Not a great toy,Neither of my kids ever really played with this toy. The movement feature broke rather early on so it only played music but did not move. Would not recommend toy. There are better toys to spend your money on.
5,Fisher Price Animal Train,"My daughter has played with this train since she was 6 months old (she is 15 months now) and loves it. The animals are cute and songs are fun. Plus it moves on our carpet without a problem. One of the better toys for this age group, in my opinion."
5,Wonderful Toy!,"I purchased this toy for my 1 yr old Grandson. The first time he played with it, he started to dance. Now whenever he pushes the button for the music, I get to enjoy seeing his moves. Very entertaining for both of us. Well made toy with many options for play."
4,"Get this train early, so your child can grow with it","We got this train as a gift from my former boss, when my daughter was about 3 months. Overall it was a good gift. She played with various parts of it over time - gnawed on a little plastic apple, investigated animals, pushed the button and listened to music. One thing that she never warmed up to is actual moving of this train. She doesn't have other battery operated moving toys, and it scares her when the train starts moving all of a sudden. Mostly she prefers to play with a car of this train and carry her toys in it. I was thinking of donating it, but I looked at all the pictures of her with it and decided to keep it for now."
5,Love the train!,This train is a great toy for kids. And my son loves to hear the clicking sounds that the animals make. It's nice being able to individually take out the animals and stick them in the diaper bag. Of course the train itself is super cute too. And it runs smoothly on carpet! Definitely recommend this toy! Great price too.
5,LOVE IT!,This toy exceeded my expectations in durable quality and all the things it does. I would highly recommend it and it's a great price. I got it for my 9-mo. old and 2 year old grandtwins. They all enjoy it very much.
5,Finally finished reading it!!!,Owen simply owns this doctrine. From start to finish he doesn't take a breath. He beats the topic to death. After you're done with the book you'll have a migraine... But the end is greater than the means.
5,Hi-NRG Lives On!!!,"What an amazing mix of non-stop, dance-til-you-drop Hi-NRG! Add to that a very sexy cover model...well, what more can I say?Stand-outs include:Tracks 1-4, 6, 10, 11 & 13Don't think twice...add this to your collection NOW!!!"
3,"Usually Good, But Sometimes...","... sometimes, you get an off package. I've used this product for years with great satisfaction, but recently I purchased one and used it last night. Unfortunately, it looked like someone goofed, because there were maybe 20 split peas in it - the rest was rolled quick cook barley or oats. I used it, but I had to go back to the market to buy some more split peas in order to make it actually pea soup - otherwise it would have been oat soup. Or barley, whatever.Still, it's usually a good product, as is their vegetable soup mix. Kosher and vegetarian, I spoiled this completely by adding a ham bone and a bunch of ham chunks to mine. It was delicious!"
4,good laptop backpack,"backpack holds my 15.4 inch laptop easily. very durable and well made... the bottom of backpack has no padding so if you put it down hard or drop it, the laptop can be damaged. they should make the laptop be suspended inside the bag to minimize shock... saw an expensive and better built tumi backpack very similar to this... think this bag is a knockoff of that bag..."
3,Nice but VERY small.,"This is a nice backpack, but not for a student. I am in graduate school and have to carry a 2"" binder to school with me everyday. WITHOUT my laptop inside, the bag could barely hold my binder - and even that took a fair amount of shoving.It does have a lot of pockets, so it would be very easy to organize. If all you're carrying is your laptop and a few little things, this bag would be highly recommended. But it was just too small for me."
2,Shoulder strap worn out in under 6 weeks of light use.,"I like the design and utility of the bag, but highly disappointed with the quality of material. A shoulder strap has worn out in less than 6 weeks of light use."
3,gift for new compter owner,I had this backpack mailed directly to the gift recipent.She seemed very pleased with it and it apparently fit her new large screen laptop
2,Low impct review,"This is video that I would recommend for someone starting out. I would not suggest this video for intermediates and advance at all. She sounds extra hyper in this video like she shouting at you. This is an older video I happen to like her new ones better. I did not like the music all that match. She does about 20 minutes of aerobics and some toning. She uses a ball in the video, but you don't know that until you use the video. I honestly thought the tape was borning. It wasn't her best. The only time I would use it if you tired and really don't want to workout. I tried it a couple of times and its sits on my shelf"
1,Atrocious,This product has convinced me to never again purchase a book self-published by its author (although I realize that there are competent writers out there who self-publish their work -- no offense intended against them). This book is simply atrocious. It is very poorly written and the plot makes no sense. I couldn't finish it. Neither could anyone who borrowed the book from me.
5,"Suspense, suspense, and more suspense!","I could not put this book down. This book is not for paranoid people. I was seeing MIB's, CIA, and FBI for weeks after reading! Highly recommended!"
3,"I'm sorry, but how could this get 5 stars?","I'm a huge fan of Gordon Liu, Lau Kar leung, & Shaw Bros. This release by Tokyo Shock is a great print, but the audio is a patch job & the movie isn't close to being a classic. If you are confused by the dialogue in the subtitles and watch it in English dub, be forewarned that this is an unmastered and incomplete original dubbing, inserting Cantonese in the holes.Yes, its got some good moral lessons of humility & it has good to decent fight choreography & performances, but the conflicts between characters doesn't make sense. Cases of miscommunication and confusion are hardly plausible and therefore the conflict seems manufactured. The story picks up after 45 minutes, but then another unrealistic confrontation drags it back down."
1,Returning things are sometimes not worth the hassle...,"It was missing a disc. Too bad I paid for FOUR... I planned on returning it but with all the things going on in my personal life I just kept putting it off and putting it off... But I'm sure people bank on that ALL THE TIME! The seller can keep one disc for four shipments and bam- new item to ship off while stiffing four other people with lives to lead. As a matter of fact, the seller can keep one disc from three people, send that set out and stiff EVERYONE! Yes, I'm a little bitter but it happens...Aside from that, the music on this set is beautiful!!!! Definitely a must listen for any and everyone!!! (and this is coming from a listener of rap and hip-hop... so broaden your horizons...)Doctor prescribed for pregnant ladies! LoL, put one earbud in your ear, the other on your belly!"
2,"Under Ten Flags, only Spanish spoken","Very good movie, alas the only language spoken is Spanish and there are no subtitles in English.This product is advertised with English/Spanish languages, therefore one would think if Spanish is spoken there would beEnglish subtitles, or vise-versa.Therefore, personally I deem it to be a subpar acquisition."
2,Left somewhat bewildered and confused,"Mr. Ellis retraces the efforts of African Americans to achieve freedom and dignity, in a Christian context. Each of these efforts have lacked something: the key to true deliverance. Unfortunately Mr. Ellis brings us to this realization and leaves us at the threshold of understanding the key to true deliverance.And here is where we remain. From our reading of the work, we could not grasp what the key was or would be that would open the door and take us across the threshold. It is a complicated issue and in this work we did not find a sense of how it could be corrected, just a deepening sense of division.As readers, we were left somewhat bewildered and confused by the work as a whole. In any event, he is to be congratulated for his efforts to provide leadership on such a difficult and troubling subject. Few have had the courage to do so."
5,Antonio Machado-Selected Poems,"I bought this collection of Machado's poems after enjoying ""Last Night I Had a Dream"" from a different anthology. This edition has both the Spanish and the English translation on facing pages, and knowing very little Spanish, I had to read them in English. Machado's poems are achingly beautiful when he writes of his native Castile in Spain; I can't judge how good the translation is to the original, but the poems are certainly beautiful in English. Selections from his proverbs require quite a bit of reflection, and here I felt at a distinct loss at not being able to read the Spanish. This collection contains poems from throughout his career, so the reader can see where his feelings changed or remained constant over time."
5,This CD Is Bound To Stir It Up!,"As an appreciator of F&TM, I find their latest release an unexpected and welcome departure from their ""usual"" musical stylings. Monica Richards and William Faith are the ultimate artists; not only musically but visually as well. The music onthis release couldn't be more exquisite and the visual is just as equal and fitting to the music. The album is an eclectic mix of music that validates that the talent of these two has evolved. As true artisans, they know not one limitation and are driven by their own instincts and talent. They prove over and over again that they are in control without interference; they choose to be true to themselves. I have no doubt that this new album will stir up controversy amongst the die hard F&TM appreciators. I believe that is exactly what Monica Richards and William Faith thrive on! The Burning Season is not to be missed!"
4,Anyone noticed the willow song?,"Great album and possibly their best. Anyone noticed the song ""Willow song""? Is this a cover of Sneaker Pimps ""How do""?"
1,Don't bother,"The title is the first problem ""Extreme Sports Bloopers"", I never considered surfing an ""extreme"" sport. This video contains falls from skiing and snowboarding, biking, rollarblading and skateboarding, and surfing.To package this as an Extreme Sports Blooper tape is stretching the imagination to the Extreme point. I've had worse falls down my basement steps. And if you liked a clip the first time, hang on, you will get to enjoy it at least once more, and sometimes twice.This DVD looks like it was put together with amateur video. The soundtrack reminds me of a bad CD being tracked through, although the credits claim different bands were involved.I purchased this DVD as a birthday present for a friend. I was expecting clips riviling ABC Sports ""agony of defeat"". What I got was the agony to my pocketbook."
2,Did not perform,"This bit would not drill out from 1 1/4th hole. I had to buy the USA bit from the same vendor and it had no issues drilling out from as small as 7/8ths. Now I had also purchased 1 1/8 and 1 1/4 in the Chinese bits. The 1 1/8 would work fine but I could not drill out 1 1/4 from the 1 1/8. Hit or miss I suppose. I tried sharpening the 1 1/4 bit to no avail, so I bought the American bits from the same vendor to get the job done. The was all on a drill press at 250 rpm into 5/8 hot rolled steel. I am sure wood or Aluminum would work fine for these bits. These are not the same as the Harbor Freight Sterling and Deming bits which are of much better quality as I was able to drill up to 1"" (largest size)with those with no issues."
3,So much creative poet,"Hasan Raza Gardezi was a very creative poet of Siraiki language, spoken in Pakistan . He belonged with a historical city of Multan.This collection is a translation of his some siraiki poems.His original book is ""DHABAY DHORAY"" published from Multan.Hasan Raza Gardezi's poetry is very impressive .He use very simple language and also he is very aware to use proper words in his poems.This collection is best translation of his poetry .It will represent the poet with his due right in English literature"
4,Another good Oxo product,Looks good in the clamshell which doesn't detract from the bathroom look. It does its job very well and is an ample size without being too much
5,Great,This looks great while in plain sight. It looks sleek and closes up when plunger re-inserted into base. Works great! I recommend it to everyone because you never know when you might need a plunger.
3,Painful packaging,"I generally love Oxo products. I have yet to use this plunger, but I wanted to warn future consumers about the (excessive and unecessary) plastic clamshell packaging around the plunger - it is extremely sharp and jagged once you cut it open! I have 5 or 6 incisions on my hands from trying to remove the plunger from the packaging last night. User beware!"
2,Useless,"This looked like it was going to be great - it seemed sanitary and well made. However what you can't see is that the rubber cup at the end is quite small compared to other plungers. (Presumably so that it can fit into its case.) Because the cup is small, it does not fit around the more rectangular exit hole in my toilet bowl. Therefore it does not make a seal, and is effectively useless.However as a bathroom accessory, it is attractive, seems clean, and superficially it seems very well made. Other than the fact that it can serve no actual use, I think it's great."
1,Doesn't work,"What I probably need are new toilets in my ten-year old house...the toilets here clog *a lot* ...ANYWAY... since we need to plunge often I was pleased to see this nice plunger design that I could have in each bathroom without being an eyesore. However, this OXO plunger doesn't work. I'm still getting the old wood-handled plunger from the hardware store out. To gross to return them."
2,Completely Useless,"We were very pleased-- attractive, seemingly well-made-- UNTIL today when we actually had to use it. We've been plunging for over an hour now (on and off)to no avail. It's impossible to get a suction. Hopefully it will work soon or I'm going to have to go to the neighbor's to pee."
4,This is a GREAT mystery book.,"A group of teenagers, who calls themselves the Galaxy Gang, likes to solve mysteries. One of the group members Larry meets a young lady, whom he calls Peter Pan, online. During a game on the internet, she suddenly disappears and Larry is convinced that there has been foul play. He and his friends try to solve this mystery and they find themselves in a lot of trouble and in the middle of a murder investigation.In this computer age, this is a very interesting book to read. The young kids, inspite of all the trouble they got into, persisted in solving this mystery and it was exciting to read about their adventures and how they finally solved this mystery."
5,Powerful and beautiful,"Romulo Gallegos, one of the best South American writers, splendidly describes the Venezuelan plains and the passionate love that emerges there. Dona Barbara -a ruthless and tough woman once hurt by men- symbolizes the wildness of the plains and Santos Luzardo -the polite and sensitive doctor from the city- the opposite side of the same coin. They meet at the plains and develop a wonderful story of love and power, surrounded by the most beautyful landscapes of the world: The venezuelan plains.You wont be able to put it down!"
4,provids great insight into the centaur and it's role.,Santos Luzardo and Dona Barbara are complete opposites who learn to give a little of themselves up to benefit the plains. The law of the land as well as the issue of property rights are dominant themes. A great novel that discusses the struggle between civilization and barbarianism.
1,Not in Spanish,"I placed this order thinking I will get this book in spanish. Well, it is in English. I will keep it for my kids, hoping they would like to read it when they grow old. I read books in English, but nothing better to read books in their original lenguage."
2,Ripped Off All Over Again!,"Good golly, with the film being as bad as it was, was I insane to even attempt reading this book? Yeah, probably.At least in the book, the characters' motivations are explained in much more detail and are more understandable. Also, the Eye is twenty years older than Joanna (who's bisexual in the book and has meaningful relationships with women) and follows her for about a decade instead of six months. Things that were difficult to understand in the movie, like why he stops her wedding to the wine mogul, are fully explained in the book.Unfortunately, being able to understand the characters doesn't make them any more likeable. It's a tawdry tale with an excessive amount of gratuitous profanity. And, like the movie, the ending really STINKS. Not recommended."
1,Totally Different than the Movie,"Since this was a novel that a movie had been based on (not a novelization,) I had high expectations. I (though I have never quite figured out why) have always loved the movie form of Eye of the Beholder, I thought I would love the book as well. However, I was greatly disappointed.The movie is about as different as possible from the book. The Eye in the book is much more unbalanced. In the book he follows Joanna Eris for purely selfish reasons whereas in the movie he is trying to help her. In the book, he intentionally kills at times where in the movie were totally accidental. Even though most people found the movie to be quite bad, the book was even worse."
5,Take stress off your list of problems,"I found the great sound of the Castells on an oldie staion playing So This is Love and I fell in love with the rich beautiful sound this group produced. I went on to get this CD and my friends this is living large in perfection. I found their fallow up hit Sacred to be just as amazing. All the tunes are A plus and will transport you back to a time of DA haircuts, fast American cars and buttery smooth harmonies. Each song has its own personallity and is very well produced to fit the very talented band members. I was about 5 when these were made but trust me you are in for a treat no matter what age, that will take the edge off of modern living. I highly suggest you get this album!"
5,The Castells,I had been looking for this recording for a few months and a friend found it for me at Amazon. I was amazed as it is REALLY old. I love the disk. There is nothing like the oldies.
3,I am so angry!,"I anxiously waited for this new release to come out and what do I get? Pretty much the same information I did with the Maya 5 Foundation book, but with a few added lines here and there and a DVD with movie tutorials of the chapters on it. The same exact color pictures and tutorials. This is really pitifull. If you have the Maya 5 Foundation book and you want to save almost $70 then do so. A good rule of thumb is to wait until you have read a few reviews on a book before purchasing it. Needless to say it is going back!"
2,shame on the author,"Diving into maya 6 unexperienced, without an aid is terribly confusing, but diving into maya 6 with this book is not that much better -- it is like a nonswimmer being thrown into the deep end of the pool with a deflated lifesaver.Sure, the directions are pretty easy to follow, but the problems arise when there are MISSING directions! I was having a headache trying to get something to work like it supposedly did in the book, when I realized that the author FORGOT to include a vital step! I would not have been able to get ahead if I had not figured out the problem on my own (through trial and error). Shame Shame SHAME on the author! Sorry we beginning users are not as professional and proficient in the program.I give this book a C+ at best. Well-written simple directions mean absolutely nothing if they are not complete!"
4,A Day in the Life!,"In the words of this new photographer, ""This book is not about light or shadow, form or beauty, but as luck would have it, my every day"". He goes on to say, ""A fantasy of sorts"", that ""was once a hobby has become a passion"". I sincerely envy this photographer's daily life, and at the same time thank him for sharing with us his passion of capturing the many facets of male beauty. These youthful models are not offensively erotic and a pleasure to behold. These black & white images clearly demonstrate what a talented eye Lozon has for showcasing these young and muscular men in very provocative and arresting photos. There are a lot of stunningly good-looking young models in this collection. This is one of my favorite male nude photography books. A ""feast for the eyes"" from a day in the life of this talented photographer!Joe Hanssen"
4,saving them for a power outage,bought these fans in case we have a power outage over the summer. they arrived quickly and look really good. put batteries in them and am pleased with the speed of the air flow. glad they work on electric and battery.
4,"!0"" Fan",This is a pretty good little fan. It will either run on AC or D Batteries. It has 2 speeds and puts out quite a bit of air.The only problem I had is that where it hinges at the bottom is very tight so use caution when trying to open it.
1,Bad battery compartment design/construction,"The battery compartment is badly designed; when batteries are inserted, the contact points do not touch the batteries properly such that you have to squeeze/twist the compartment for it to work. I do not recommend this fan if you want to use it with batteries."
1,Battery Installation requires a Miracle,"I bought this fan, model 1054, for use in our tent. But we can use it only at home, plugging it in with the adaptor. The battery compartment is poorly made, and as you install batteries they keep popping out. Also, the contacts don't line up correctly, so even after I got all the batteries in, the cover wouldn't close because one battery sticks up somewhat.I wish I had returned it for a refund, but we had taken it along on our trip and discarded the box, thinking this would be a GOOD and USABLE fan. Paying so much extra for the battery option was a waste of money and very frustrating.The model # 1078 has a much better battery compartment; we have it; it works well."
1,Could have burned down my house,When it worked it moved quite a bit of air for a fan of its size but after about a year and a half of light to moderate usage the resistor for the switch burned out. The AC adapter was so hot I nearly burned myself on it and when I disassembled the fan I found a severely scorched switch assembly.Something tells me a recall should be in order before someone gets hurt.
1,Fire Hazard,"The resister in the 10"" Battery/AC fan exploded after 3 days of use, as well as the AC plug in would become extremely hot after 30-45 minutes of use. I would be wary about this Product"
2,False Advertising,"The Cool 02 Fan model 1054 does not run for 72 hours as described in the writeup for the product. I just received mine and the box says: ""Up to 40 hour battery life"" and then in another spot: ""Battery life is determined using low speed"". The box also clearly states it is a model 1054, so I did not receive the wrong or a substitute product. I ordered the 1054 and paid about ten dollars more than the model 1071 because it claimed to have a longer battery life. Haven't figured out why they think this model deserves a premium price."
5,Pleased with purchase,"Great tent fan - even effective in a small shelter w/ tables & chairs. Would recommend to a friend.Does take eight D batteries - however, 8 D batteries lasted us the entire weekend running the fan all night and some parts of the day. We stayed three nights. It did get 'weaker' by the day we left.Overall a good purchase - stands upright and you can adjust the angle so that it blows, up, down, straight on, etc. Does come with an adapter (if you have access to power) but does not charge batteries."
5,It Should Be Called WOW Fan!,"I had an older model of this fan and I had dropped it 3 times and it finally broke to where it didn't work. I went on line looking and I saw this fan (Model # 1054).I ordered it and I have to say it is ""Way Cool"". While I am passing meds, I place it on my med cart and it keeps me cool. At home I can plug it in to an electrical socket and it keeps me cool. Indoor/outdoor it doesn't matter. You have cool air when you need it. The set up is better than the old one, because this fan stands steady. I keep extra batteries on hand, in case they go out. They last a while. All I can say is "" I am loving it""."
1,Switch broke on 2 of them,"Switches break after about 6 months or so - it's such a great fan, nice to hang it where it is needed, but I've had 2 of them, this style and another style, and the switch just breaks, then the fan doesn't work at all. I'm sorry I bought another one to replace the first one that broke. So no more o2 cool for me."
3,"A cool fan, but you get what you pay for","This unit was purchased as an emergency cooling unit during a recent power outage. It is a bit noisy for non-emergency use, but it does move enough air to keep a small room from being unbearable. May have some lubrication issues - need to find and read a manual, not sure whether there are any user-accessible lubrication points. When run for long periods it develops a mildly annoying squeak that disappears after a couple of days rest."
4,Great Fan!,"We usually camp out in the spring early summer or fall, instead of trying to camp out when it's super warm out. We decided to camp in July and bought this to help make the tent more comfortable overnight, and when we were in there in the rain (!!) It was a great investment. It folds nicely to pack easily, and had a great amount of air movement, especially during the rain, when the tent was muggy inside.The batteries were really tough to get in. I wouldn't have marked it down for that, but they were so tough, I thought I'd break the unit putting them in. Other than that, it was a great unit and totally worth the price. I'd recommend this to anyone."
2,Weak Air Flow,"I purchased this fan to use on the golf course. We planned on hanging it on the golf cart to blow air on us as we played golf. The fan was quiet which was very good for the golf course, but it did not move any air. The blades on the fan are small which I believe is why you can't feel any air flow unless you put your face right up to the fan. It had some good features such as a handle to be able to hang the fan from something; as well as, a flip down stand if you wanted to sit it on a flat surface. However, I would not recommend it."
1,worthless,"O2-Cool Model 1054 10"" Indoor/Outdoor FanA waste of money. Can't even feel the breeze unless you are one inch in front of the fan"
1,fan rubs front grill,I tried several O2 fans and they all rubbed the front grill. If anyone has a fix please let me know because otherwise the fans are good.
1,Slick but nonsensical design,"""Ooooh, it's only an inch thick. It's so sleek.""Wanna know why most fans aren't this thin? Cause blade depth is what moves air! This blade depth on this is so narrow that the fan has to beat the living crap out of the air to get it moving ...making this fan very loud. Think of all the noise your fan makes, then add a high pitched whine for the low setting. You will not be falling asleep, in any room where this fan is on the high setting. Whatever you currently own is quieter than this ...so is anything elsse you might buy."
2,Burns out quickly,I purchase mine from a drugstore. Three months later it stopped working. I think it would be OK for occasional use only.
3,Check for Battery Use,"I use these fans with batteries to help cool my dogs during dog events. I found they are better than the typical dog crate fan in moving air, but I have also found they can be erratic on battery power only. The compartments for the 8 D cell batteries are difficult to install batteries, and when installed, the contacts between batteries can be problem some. Two of the four units I purchased had problems, one with contacts that are erratic, causing the fan to stop and the other that runs with the battery cover off but will not run with the battery compartment cover on. I also found the earlier units I purchased had a useful j hook built into the handle, while the later units did not.Pros: Versatile stand, quiet, and moves a fair amount of air.Cons: Batteries difficult to install and contact between batteries can be erratic. Non-rechargeabe batteries will be expensive over timeIf you plan to run on batteries, look for better options, particularly ones using rechargeable batteries."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,I ordered two of these fans. Both arrived with no shipping damage. Both were dead on arrival. One had a bad speed switch and the other had a bad hinge between the base and the fan.
1,not happy,"The fan did not work with the batteries and there were no return forms with the product, so I guess I am stuck with a fan that does not work!"
3,Battery pig,"Works great on battery power, but I lowered my overall rating because it takes 8 D batteries. I improved cooling performance slightly by using an ""s"" hook to hang a small, wet sponge on the fan's face. I live in rural East Texas where frequent high winds create power outages, so a portable fan such as this one is handy to have around."
5,Good Product. Good price,Works great. Helps keep my boat breezy even in AZ. D cell lasted at least over night. Quiet enough to sleep by.
4,Excellent Portable Fan,"I purchased two of these fans last year for my first-ever camping experience as an adult. They worked flawlessly. I can't attest to how long the batteries last as we used them only in the morning -- and occasionally in the afternoon -- over a four-day period, but they certainly moved a lot of air around and enabled us to sleep in a little longer than we might have without them."
4,Worth the money **,"I have used this fan on atleast 2 camping trips. This is the best I have used so far. Have tried atleast 3 to 4 diffent companies, including coleman. For 2 to 3 person tent, one should do. For larger need atleast 2 fans. It for sure can move the air. It's fairly simple to set it up ( assuming one can read and comprehend ). Only, reason I gave 4 is because of the 8 D batteries it consumes. Well, it justifies the performance."
1,Great little fan but...,"Great little fan but it died after a month! The motor stopped I tried plugging into different outlets new batteries. I contacted O-2 Cool and they said they do not have a factory warranty on it, and I was surprised because almost every product you buy comes with a warranty. So I'm out $20 something dollars. Please read the reviews before buying this fan!!"
5,Exactly What I Expected!,"It's a great fan, I use at the gym and even dropped it off the elliptical, and it STILL works!"
4,"O2 Cool Model 1054 10""",Bought this for a cabin style tent to use for a first aid station. The weather was about 86 degrees.. Worked great to cool a dehydrated patient..So much quieter than most small fans.. Best to keep it not far from you. Does not cool down a whole tent.. Very portable. Held up on batteries for over 8 hours or more.
1,"Instructional CD, not music!","This is an instructional album on basic latin jazz rythms and so on. Each cut starts out with a male voice saying ""1,2,3"". The pieces are stultifyingly boring and in rigid metronome tempi. This CD is only of interest if you are learning basic latino jazz stuff. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT THE REAL THING! This album comes with an instruction manual which you are not informed of here at the Amazon site. For students only!"

4,Ohio State Buckeye License Plate,License plate was as described on Amazon.Com. Plate is of good quality and looks. I am happy with product. There is nothing else that I would like to add to this review.
5,We all love this book!,"My four year old son loves this book, and we love reading it to him. It's also a great book for giving examples of the letter D. Very clever writing!"
3,"beautiful watch for the price, but it's running slow","This is a surprisingly beautiful watch for under $30. The cons: the ticking is relatively loud, and my particular watch lost about a minute a day. I've since returned it for a replacement. As a side note, this was the first item I've returned to Amazon and I was pleasantly surprised how easy the process was. Kudos to Amazon!"
4,Loved it right out of the box,"I've grown really tired of plastic watches and was absolutely fed up with scrambling to find instructions on how to reset my watch every time daylight savings time rolled around, so I went back to an old friend: Timex. It did not disappoint.You get a pretty darn lovely watch for what you pay. It's substantial, well made and simple. I think I may have to be a Timex girl for life.The watch was delivered a full week ahead of schedule, which was definitely a plus."
4,Timex Watch,"Attractive, comfortable watch with a nice size face. Numbers are easy to read and leather has a good, rich color. I purchased it as a gift for my honey, and he really likes it."
4,GOOD WATCH-GOOD PRICE.,"THEY'RE PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF BETTER WATCHES THAT DO MANY TRICKS. I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I PAID FOR AND THAT'S WHY I GAVE 4 STARS.I WANTED A QUALITY WATCH THAT LOOKED GOOD, WAS ACCURATE, HAD THE DATE ON IT AND WAS INEXPENSIVE.IF THATS WHAT YOU WANT, BUY THIS WATCH. P.S. IT ALSO HAS A VERY NICE LEATHER STRAP."
5,Good looking watch,I bought this watch because I liked both the style and the price. I was not disappointed. It looks great and people can't believe it was such a great buy.
3,Not as great as I expected from Timex,"I purchased the product as a gift for my husband. It is a nice looking watch, no doubt. It looks more expensive than actually paid :) Unfortunately one of the pieces that holds the strap down broke off after wearing it like 7 times only. Thankfully the watch does have two holding pieces, so it is not a complete goner, yet. I expected a little more out of the Timex product. But I guess the old adage of ""You get what you paid for"" stands true."
4,great watch for the money,It's about as little money that you can spend on a watch and have it look this good and keep great time. Oh yes the person that saidthe band is short and very flimsy was right on the money looks like the keep will sone break off.I have no problem getting a betterband when it doe's.
4,great watch/great style,the look and feel of a classic watch. nice heavy leather band. I like the old fasion look & feel
5,"Feels Great, Looks even Better","I can't help it. I'm a watch nut, but not a picky one. At least I never thought so. But, a watch has to speak and three words it has to say are, comfort, style and accuracy. This Timex screams all three. Chances are when you wear it, someone will notice, most likely after you've forgotten this lightwegiht comfortable timepiece is on your wrist. You like the retro look that wears like a dream and works and looks like a watch costing a few thousand dollars? You'll fall in love with this one."
2,"Timex Men's Classic Square Watch - ""you get what you pay for""",This watch broke a little after the 30 day return period. Basically the watch runs slow. The cost to fix it even under warranty by Timex is not worth it. Buy a better quality watch. It does look nice.
4,"Nice watch, shame about the wristband","This watch is even nicer than its photo. The face of the watch has some nice details that don't really show up on the photo.What is disappointing is that the wristband, although very nice out of the box, is extremely absorbent. At the slightest sweat (for instance after a sustained walk) it soaks up sweat like a wick, and the leather darkens.If it continues, I'll probably get a better wristband, as the watch deserves it.Finally, the actual watch is slightly squarer than it appears in the photos."
3,Slightly Dissapointed,"The watch arrived in time for Christmas, was a good price, etc but when my boyfriend opened the watch Christmas day there were scuff marks on the band and the battery was not working. The watch will not tick at all and now I have to go to a jewelers and get a new battery. That will teach me not to order online last minute."
1,Lousy watch,"I had a similar style of this watch that finally wore out. I got this to replace it. I had it for all of 2 weeks when I noticed that it seemed to be running slow. At first, I thought I did not set it correctly, but then I noticed it was loosing more and more time and that it was the watch. When I tried to return it, the seller - TimeOutlet - advised me that I had just missed their 21 day return policy and that for a mere $16.99 I could send it in and they would look at it. Phooey! It is the first and only Timex that I have ""owned"" that didn't even come close to living up to the ""Takes a lick'en and keeps on tick'en"" moto. Also, shame on TimeOutlet."
4,Great watch for the price,This is a great watch. The only complaint that I have is that the battery died not too long after I bought the watch.
3,It works,"It does what it was built to do. It was sent to me in appropriate delivery time. No, I DO NOT LOVE IT! It is a memory board not a pet hamster.Buy it, plug it in, turn on computer and it works."
4,Close to perfect,I loved the shirt and I know it said burgundy in the description but beware if you are looking just at the photo it is much different than that.
1,What product???,It's pretty hard to rate a product that I never recieved!! I have attempted for almost 2 months to have my toothpaste delivered to me but to no avail.. The charge has already hit my credit card and yet I have nothing to show from it so if and when the Vitamin Store decides to resend me my product I will rate it at that time! Thanks
3,A very specialized sociological study,"This book is a welcome escape from the usual exotic kaleidoscope of old Shanghai descriptions of the city as the Paris of Asia, with its underworld, foreign expatriates, princely buildings and so on. On the contrary it documents Shanghai at street level and portrays the every day life of the man in the street. Obviously the work of an academic, it details immigration patterns, the intricacies of byzantine rental agreements, rickshaw fare structures, shikumen house floor plans in a scientific way. A long but fascinating reading, it will only appeal to people who already know the city well and want to go one step further in their understanding of Shanghai - and are not put off by the astronomic quantity of Chinese words contained in its pages."
5,Pack of Balls for Ferrets,These are small little balls and have bells inside which make it attractive and fun for my pet. He loves to play with them and is really cute doing so.
2,Misleading Title,"The book was good, if you want a step by step history review that doesn't get out of Pennsylvania. The title should be ""The Upper Ohio River"". I live in Indiana and would have liked to known more about the lower Ohio."
5,GOOD BOOK!,"Contrary to another ""review"" (and I use the term very loosely) here, this is a perfectly charming little book with lovely illustrations, and I, personally, would recommend it!"
3,"Get this for Marino's ""Babylon""","This is worth the price of admission just to have Frank Marino's ""Babylon"" track. Feel free to hear it and other rare axework atJazzRock-Radio(dot)com RIFF ON DUDES!"
2,"Great pictures, poorly written","Mother zebra is trying to get her little one off to bed but he has other ideas. He wants to giggle, throw off his covers, play games and cause general havac at bedtime. He lays still long enough for his mom to think he's asleep and then scampers off to find mischief. He finds a hippo and they end off goofing around and getting in trouble with their respective mothers.I picked up this book at the library and was attracted to the cute and fun-loving pictures. I must say I was disappointed when we got home. I know the desciption may sound cute and in a way it is, but the way it was written was just blah. Check this book out in the library and see if you like it before you purchase it."
5,Where is the DVD???????,"This is one of the best films about the emotional chaos created by a broken marriage; and it manages to accomplish this by somehow sidestepping all the cliches. Like the other commentors, I'm completely flabbergasted by the fact there is no dvd??"
5,Loved it before,"One of my favorite older movies...Saw it in movie theatre when they still had double features, lol. Glad it was available."
2,Ehh,Kinda weird...but not the worst thing ever.....only a one time read..but overall ad a happy ending which is acceptable .
3,Meh,"I feel like there was something missing from this story. Overall, it was okay. Blah blah blah I have to write more. DONE!"
4,Okay,First off who ever sherri is must be wrong if every other reviewer including me liked it. There were some parts I didnt like but its still a good read.
3,GOOD INTRO TO SALSA,"The first thing I found challenging was the instructor's accent and she seemed to be yelling a lot on top of the music. Since I found her accent a challenge, it was great that she explained the steps before performing it."
2,cardio salsa,"Instructor was too hyper. The dances were not demostrated or explained clearly. Furthermore, the dances were misconstrued and chaotically jumbled; whereby, not allowing for the unique elements of each type of music to be enjoyed and appreciated."
2,Confusing DVD,"I own several DVD's from Crunch Fitness and this one is definitely not one of my favorites. I can barely understand what the instructor is saying and she goes through all the moves so fast, I just stay so confused as to what's going on! I think I've tried this DVD twice and now it's part of my collection that sits there! I didn't enjoy it and I probably wouldn't try anymore."
2,Misleading.,"I went into this workout as a beginner in ""salsa"", which from what the DVD case said, was ideal. The moves and dances were very hard to follow, and I found that, after attempting the ENTIRE workout, I never even broke a sweat. It's hard to burn calories when all you're doing is stumbling around confused. It was a waste of time for me, but more experienced dancers may get more out of it.The music and other dancers are enjoyable to watch, however."
4,Low Impact and Lots of Fun,"I bought this DVD hoping to find a fun dance workout that would get my heart rate up. Well, Cardio Salsa is lots of fun, but my heart rate didn't get above 130 the entire workout. I did burn a couple of hundred calories though and it definitely kept me moving.The dance combinations were fairly easy in the beginning when she takes you through the seperate steps and got pretty intricate when you put them all together. I have NO rhythm, but was able to follow along with most of it. I imagine after three or four viewing, I will be able to follow along better and that should increase my calorie burn and help get my heart rate a little higher. I felt like I got a nice light workout that made me sweat. There wasn't a lot of jumping around, which my knees definitely appreciated.This is definitely going into heavy rotation at my house."
4,Cardio Salsa,"I have a recent interest in salsa dancing and this video has been fun, gets the heart rate up and is not too difficult."
3,Shake Those Buns!,"This is a fun video. The instructor is upbeat and keeps you motivated with out that perky Denise Austin effect. This is almost entirely a lower body work out and not a very intense one. The lives drums and the cheerful backup dancers make it fun video to participate with. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with serious workout ambitions, however if you are a beginner trying to jump start your workout routine, buy this Crunch dvd."
4,Good video for the collection,"I just completed working out to this video. I took kickboxing classes that really got your heart rate up, so I was anticipating that I wouldn't really sweat at all to a salsa workout. But I did. Reviewers who complain about having difficulty following moves or that the instructor didn't properly demonstrate the steps must remember that this is not a training video for salsa dancing. It's a workout, so if you're sweating and burning calories then the video is doing exactly what it should."
2,Not for the uncoordinated,"I am not very coordinated, and the music doesn't help. She keeps talking about feeling the rhythym, they need more fun beats to lose yourself in. I am not quick enough to pick up all the steps when she is teaching them, it is easier when they are all put together. Coreography is fine, but the step by step process trips me up. I was expecting this to be better, more fun. It was more frustrating than it was fun. The only reason you break a sweat is trying to keep up."
2,Not much of a cardio workout,"I agree with the other reviewers who were disappointed in this video. I love to dance (although I am far from considering myself ""a dancer""!) and really wanted to like this video, but it has been gathering dust. Although Gisele is cheery and upbeat without being annoying, she doesn't provide much of a cardio workout for those at the intermediate or advanced level. I also found the steps so easy, it was boring by third time. Anyone in decent shape looking for a challenging cardio workout should look elsewhere."
5,Solid Workout,"I teach an aerobics class in junior high and have purchased many tapes to get an idea of things to do and also for my own workouts. Most of them pan around the room so you don't always know what you're supposed to be doing or use routines that change quickly, don't repeat and are too hard to follow. Watching this routine, you would think it is easy, but when you try to do it yourself, it really gives you a workout. The steps are low impact, but it is really strenuous after a while. The feet and arms of the leader are always in the picture so you can see what she is doing and most of the combinations are easy to pick up. It's a good workout and is not boring like so many others."
2,Not much fun,"I didn't care for this workout video. It was a bit cheesy and over the top. I tried a couple of the moves and just couldn't get into it. I don't know if it's because I'm not into salsa or if it's because I found the instructor really annoying. Either way, I gave it back to my friend who let me borrow it right away."
3,A little slow,"This video was just OK. The pace is a little slow, I barely broke a sweat through the entire thing. While fun and easy, don't buy it if you are looking for a good cardio workout or to learn salsa. It is more of a latin dance light aerobics video."
1,Instructor is Latin annoying!,"She is annoying and they all look like midgets! It does have a lot of energy, but can be confusing to keep up with."
4,Great for Beginners,"While this wasn't a Tae-Bo level workout, it was fun, and I worked up a sweat. I love dance based videos rather than straight aerobic videos, because you can have a little fun. I've read reviews that said that the instructor didn't break down the the steps enough, and she moved too fast. Now, I do have a few years of dance experience under my belt, but the moves weren't complicated. The video may move a little fast, but after you do it once or twice, it doesn't matter."
2,"Not enough Cardio, Too much Salsa",If you want to work out this is not the DVD for you. I barely broke a sweat and my heart rate didn't come close to my target. Plus the instructor goes way to fast which becomes discouraging and frustrating. I got through the first four combinations and gave up. Then I did Taebo.
2,Difficult to follow,"I bought this DVD hoping to improve my dancing skills while also getting a workout. Either I have 2 left feet, or this DVD just isn't as easy to follow as its editorial comments suggest (""not difficult to learn""). I own many other aerobic workout videos and have no trouble following them. This one, however, at a fast pace, without slowing down to teach each one. Overall, I am disappointed and I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it."
4,High energy workout that burns calories without high impact,"This is a high-energy workout that was easy to follow and not to hard on your body while still burning lots of calories and breaking a nice sweat. (I have been nursing a foot injury for the past 7 months and kept up just fine--I just left out any hops/jumps.) It was a nice balance of aerobics and dance, leaning towards aerobics. I thought the instructor did a good job of starting with basic foot patterns and then adding hips, arms, more steps and cha-chas, etc. If you don't have a dance background or haven't gone to many aerobics classes, you might get lost in a few places, but just remember that as long as you're moving, you're burning calories! If you want a break from your normal aerobic routine, give this DVD a try. I would even consider buying this one.P.S. As a fun side note, this video also features the same stoned drummer in the background that I am pretty sure was also in the ""Yoga Booty Ballet"" video I recently rented."
2,salsa .. . .,the quality of the DVD is great the actual instruction for this cardio salsa is not very exciting. too repetitive and it doesn't really gets your heart rate up. . . disappointing content. But the vendor was great!
4,Fun Dance Video,"I take salsa lessons, do a lot of workout videos and am in pretty good shape. While this video isn't much of a cardio or dance challenge for me, it is fun and a good way to break up the monotony of aerobic workouts. The instructor has great energy and the music is enjoyable. The steps were not hard to learn, but I can see what the other reviewers meant--that she is not good at cuing throughout the combinations, but you can still pick up the steps without too much trouble. Overall, I thought it was a fun way to spice up working out."
2,Difficult for beginners,"I bought this DVD hoping to add some variety to my collection of excercise videos. The music is good and the instructor is energetic, however I found it's rather difficult for someone who is unfamiliar with latin moves or someone who does not do advanced aerobics. After about 2 months I can only do some of the moves, despite watching the video in slow motion and rewinding a lot (to figure out how she does the dance steps). I would recommend this DVD only for those who are experienced in dance or have had extensive experience with aerobics."
3,Disappointed....,"I worked out at a Crunch gym for 2 years and was excited to learn about this new video. unfortunately, I tried it today and was very disappointed. I've had several dance classes throughout college and high school and found this instructor extremely hard to follow. I agree with other posters that she ""yells"" the instructions at you and it's very hard to stay on task. She also doesn't take the combinations step by step as they do in most classes. She does one part of the combination, then another part, then expects you to link them up immediately.The music was great and the workout did go by fast...but I've been doing TaeBo workouts for the last 2 months and found TaeBo to be a much more vigorous workout than Cardio Salsa."
2,Not a salsa workout,I was expecting something completely different when I bought this video. I thought I was getting a workout that would replicate the group salsa classes I've been taking for the past year. I just don't have the time to make it to the studio as often. The classes are wonderful and are nothing like this DVD. This is really a pretty typical aerobic dance routine set to vaguely Latin music with a step here and there that is reminiscent of salsa. The low rating is for what I see as false advertising.
3,Just Okay,This definitely keeps you thinking. If you want a moderate workout then this is for you. However the ques from Giselle were not that good. I had a hard time following and I used to be a top rated fitness instructor in my area...so i was a bit disappointed.
3,Fun,"I enjoyed this video. First let me start that I don't have a dance background. However, I had very few problems with following the steps. They're really not very difficult. You get in what you put in, so if you're more of an advanced person, you'll have to work a little harder to work up a sweat. The workout is fun and since it's broken into segments, it's not as boring as some workouts can be. Also, if you have difficulty with one segment, you may have a better chance of catching on to one of the subsequent segments/ My main complaint about the video is that I wish it were longer. I actually play it twice when I want a decent workout."
5,Fun and Effective!,"Love this video. It's one of my fav's. The moves aren't that difficult to follow and I honestly never get tired of it. It's not as intense as some of the others such as tae bo, but it is effective. The more you get into it, the more results you will see."
2,Very hard to follow,"I was very excited when I first got this in the mail but as I went through it, I got more and more disappointed. It was very hard to follow the instructor. Unless you are already familiar with the salsa dancing, you will get lost!! If you can keep up, it will give you an intense workout, but good luck. I do not recommend this DVD to the average person trying to lose weight!!"
3,good but some disappointment,"dance steps are fine and not too difficult but steps are done to a percussion beat rather than to tunes and real latin music. I really prefer music and so this doesn't feel like dancing, just exercising, and therefore isn't as much fun."
2,So where are the moves?,"This video hypes all the great dance moves it is going to teach you... The salsa and mambo steps are very basic and the rest of the material is just boring. The hand movements are rather comical. The music is OK, but not particularly inspiring. I get much better dance moves at my gym class. Money wasted."
2,Workout? what workout?,"I wouldn't consider this a workout--unless you call ""marching in place"" exercise. I was hoping to learn some dance moves while I burned calories, but I got neither. The instructor moves WAY too fast and doesn't spend enough time teaching the moves. And even if you can master the moves, the workout itself isn't strenuous enough to really get any results. I seriously doubt that any of the other ""class members"" got their rock-hard bodies from doing this workout. That brings me to my last complaint--the Crunch people. They look like strippers. What's wrong with using real people like Billy Blanks' Tae Bo videos?! It's much less intimidating. I'm thinking of keeping this to try and learn the moves in case I ever go to Miami(maybe I can play the DVD in slow motion?), but I won't be using it as an exercise video."
2,Gym class rather than Latin Dance!,"It's not so fun as described, I found this DVD is more like a gym class rather than a latin dance's. As a Latin Dance fan, I found those practices and instructions are not formal to Latin Dance, from the feelings to steps. And I notice that the only male dancer is doing good, but he's hidden in the crowd ""so well."" One, two, three, four... gym class."
