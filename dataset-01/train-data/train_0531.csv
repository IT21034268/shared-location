2,Boys,"All Britney Spears ever sings about are losing guys. Come on, isn't that enough? Also, for the lyrics to ...Baby One More Time, why does she want her ex-boyfriend to hit her? Did the writers of the song write it because it was the only thing they could come up with, or did they think teenage girls wanted to get their ex-boyfriends back by letting them hit them? And, please, ""E-Mail My Heart""? The only reason I gave this an extra star is because two of her songs are pretty good."
3,Check this out,"Though I've not bought the whole album, I have listened to the samples of her songs on the Net. Baby one more time is nice. (U Drive Me) Crazy is nice, too. But as for the rest of her songs, well, I will not comment. B'coz I've not bought the album, I dun have the rite 2 give her 5 stars or 1 star, so I'll just give her 3. But 2 the other listeners, plse dun only buy her album coz she's pretty. Think about her talent. Is she really THAT good?"
4,It's a fun cd!,"I like the whole thing. I listen to it at night while I work on my writing. She has both, fast and slow songs and I love the duet ""I Will Still Love You"". I only wish I had the lyrics to all the songs. My favorite is ""Born to make you happy""."
3,I thought the Cd was decent.,At first i thought the Album was going to be a great hit but it turned out not to be. After the first few songs it does down the drain. On the back of the Cd it shows that Britney hasn't even writen one song. You either love it or you don't.
1,"Pop Music, Baby","Contrary to popular belief, music can be good. There are some records that will change you for the rest of your life. They are made by committed artists who put all of their energy and emtion into making something they can be proud of. If any one of those people had made this record, they would have buried every copy in a deep hole in the woods, changed their names, and moved to Alaska. This record is about as cornball, cliched, and vapid as you could expect. And the sad thig is, music seems to be getting even worse in it's steady decline into the pits of hell. Britney is pretty, so maybe she should be a model and save us all the trouble of buying earplugs. If you want to learn more about the musicians I spoke of earlier, they are: The Velvet Underground, Wilco, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, John Cage, Dave Brubeck, Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, Neutral Milk Hotel, Sonic Youth, U.S. Maple, The Beatles, My Bloody Valentine, Public Enemy, and Built To Spill. Thanks."
1,komedyqueen317@hotmail.com: not impressed,I've heard the same thing over and over again. This cd is not creative and tries to make the same point with every song. Her voice is off-key and computer enhanced. I would say she is on dire need of voice lessons. I hated this album.
1,"If I could, I would have given her and her album 0 stars.","I really don't like Britney Spears. Her music is decent but she really can't sing. Her songs are overproduced and are all the same with basically the same lyrics and beat. Some songs are semi-decent like the overplayed ""Baby One More Time"" and ""Sometimes"" but others like ""Soda Pop"" and ""Email My Heart"" make we wonder how this girl got a record deal in the first place. As for her personality, I think she is a very bad role model and conveys conflicting messeges to her young fans. In interviews she says, ""Be yourself and be happy with who you are."" Then she goes and gets breast implants to futher increase her popularity. I found many photos taken of her are sickening. Hopefully she wont be around for very much longer but I can guarentee that I will never buy any of her albums or merchandise. I don't want to give money to a 17 year old girl who wants to act like a Playboy bunny."
5,A Great Import Album!!,"This album is the Japanese re-release of Britney's debut album. It has exclusive cover art, and exclusive japenese booklets inside. It also includes Autumn Goodbye, Deep In My Heart, I'll Never Stop Loving You and the two bonus Baby remixes (...Baby One More Time (Davidson Ospina Radio Mix and ...Baby One More Time (Boy Wunder Radio Mix). A great buy for any collector, however if you just want the tracks try the Australian Version.. it is 1/2 the price of this one.. but be prepared not to receive all of the exclusives this album has to offer. This album will become rare soon.. so if you really want it order it now."
2,"baby, one more time","I will be glad when Britany Spears is no longer heard over the airways. Her voice seems to have only minimal range and she has so much backup, you can hardly hear her own voice anyway. Her music has a good beat to appeal to the younger audience, but it is kiddy like and she has no songs written by her. I hope she flies where Tiffany and Debbie Gibson are."
2,Please make it stop!,"I tried to give Britney Spears a chance. I'm not one of thosepeople who is against teeny bopper singers, but if I hear ""Hit MeBaby One More Time"" or ""Drive Me Crazy"" again, I will go crazy and be forced to hit people. I'm not saying that Britney is bad, but she is not the great vocal talent that others would have her be. Her voice sounds young (almost cartoonish) because she is young, but she makes the mistake of trying to achieve a sound she's not capable of. Yes, she is bubble gum pop. Yes, there is a place for it somewhere. I even gave her 2 stars, because I have, to my horror, found myself humming one of her songs."
4,great CD,"....Baby One More Time is a great album that has a good variety of dance beats and ballads. Britney gives of the same energy that Madonna did in the 80's. My favorite songs included ""Crazy"", ""Sometimes"", and ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"". Low notes: ""Soda-Pop"", ""E-mail my Heart""."
2,She doesn't have the voice.,"Ever since Britney Spears hit no.1 with ""...Baby One More Time"" people seem to never stop talking about this girl. But is her album worth all the fuss? I like ""...Baby One More Time"" but most of her other songs are not as good as her no.1 hit and her singing voice is not suitable for certain songs in her album. If you are looking for a good debut album by a female teen, I highly recommend Billie's ""Honey to the B"" or Christina Aguilera's self titled album."
1,"Sure, if you like superficial muscians...","Britney Spears' songs aren't good. I frankly have no respect for her at all, the way she dresses is just one of the reasons. PLUS, all the girl does is dance and lip sync! I mean, can you call that talent?! If her songs were OKAY sounding, then MAYBE you could overlook the lack of orginality of the whole CD, but they aren't! It's just fake, WAY too sugary pop music that is just perfect for teenie-boppers, and she keeps on adding this fake emphasis to her voice which is not cool. But hey, if you like superficial musicians, knock yourself out."
3,Great singles,"Pure ear candy....and what's wrong with that? So what if it's all meaningless fluff? I dare anyone to deny they don't find some of this catchy, unless they are afraid to admit it in front of their friends. But it's OK....really.....go ahead and roll up the car windows and sing along."
4,"Pretty Good- NOT the best, but pretty good!","I have the cd, and i think it's pretty good. I don't like all of the songs on her cd, but I like most of them. But overall, I'd say that the cd is worth buying!"
1,THIS CD DOSENT EVEN DESERVE A STAR!!!!!!!!!!!,"I HATE HOW THERES SO MUCH BANDS OUT THERE THAT CAN MAKE MILLIONS MUSIC AND THEN THERES THE GARAGE BANDS OUT THERE THAT CAN PLAY (((MUSIC))).WHY DOES BRITNEY HAVE TO SING ABOUT TEEN LOVE ALL THE TIME.CANT SHE SING ABOUT SOMETHING BESIDES PUPPY LOVE.OPPS IM SORRY I SHOUDNT BLAME HER CAUSE SHE DOSENT PICK OUT WHAT SHE WANTS TO SING CAUSE SHE DOSENT WRITE THE LYRICS.TO ALL THOSE GIRLS OUT THERE WHO LIKE MUSIC JUST BECAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE LIKES IT LISTEN TO MUSIC LIKE KORN,PANTERA,BOB DYLAN,PEARL JAM,SOUNDGARDEN,ORGY,MATCHBOX 20,GARBAGE AND THE LIST GOES ON.YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO JHON TESH OR DARE I SAY COUNTRY MUSIC THEN THIS.PLEASE GIRLS PLEASE LISTEN TO SOME BAND,ANY BAND THAT HAS LYRICS THAT MEAN SOMETHING.PLEASE DO IT FOR ME,NO,DO IT FOR YOURSELF.OR BABY ILL HAVE HIT YOU MORE THAN ONE MORE TIME SO YOU CAN WAKE UP.I KNOW THERES A BRAIN SOMEWHERE UP THERE SO USE IT WHEN IT COMES TO PICKING WHAT MUSIC YOU LIKE."
1,I've had more fun cutting myself shaving,"I could barely finish this CD before loosing my lunch. Did you notice that the song ""...baby one more time"" has the same chord progression as the new hit ""Oops!... I did it again""? That's right, they're practically THE SAME SONG. Listen to each one, one right after the other. That's why everyone loves her new song as much as her first hit. People tell me they bought her record because they think she's a good dancer, but tell me, how can you SEE HER DANCING ON THE RECORD? If you just like her dancing, buy the video. She's not a bad dancer, but that doesn't make her a good singer or songwriter (not that she wrote ANY of those songs in the first place). I just hope that her records don't make the top 20 of all time among musicians (not performers like Britney) who have some real talent.And believe me, she's close."
1,I'm Hearing 'Blah Blah Blah',"All I hear coming out of Britney's mouth is blah blah blah and crap*y, meaningless music. Here's why:'...Baby One More Time'-her voice is annoying and computer generated, as usual'(You Drive Me) Crazy'-SHE drives me crazy (in a negative way)!'Sometimes'-1 of 3 good songs on hereSoda Pop'-keyword: pop'Born to Make You Happy'-if you want a good version of this song, listen to 'Tribute to Britney Spears'. Better voice singing HER song!'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart'-she sounds desperately sick'I Will Be There'-1 of 3 good songs on here'I Will Still Love You'-1 of 3 good songs on here'Thinkin' About You'-boring'E-Mail My Heart'-stupid'The Beat Goes On'-the way she sings it and the beat don't go togetherSo, as you can tell, this album [disappoints]! The only songs I recommend are 'Sometimes', 'I Will Be There', and 'I Will Still Love You'. The rest, SKIP!"
1,Disappointed...,"I have to admit I went along with the hype about this teenage prodigy but after listening to the entire album I am thoroughly disappointed. I was really hoping this would be a showcase for her talent. ""Baby, One More Time"" is the best of the entire album. ""(You Drive Me) Crazy"" is a thumpin' dance track but the remix on the ""Drive Me Crazy"" soundtrack is better and you get a little taste of what her vocal talent could be if she would just sing. ""Born to Make You Happy"" is also a showcase of her voice but on every other track she is trying her best to imitate Pee Wee Herman (e.g. From the Bottom of My Broken Heart & The Beat Goes on) when she should just sing. She doesn't appear to have any confidence in her talent and tries way too hard to stretch her modest voice. This tactic makes my stomach turn. I will hesitate to buy her next CD until I have heard more than one track."
5,A worthy album...,"I bought this album after ""Sometimes"" was released and I didn't expect to find anything else worthy on it. I was surprisingly wrong. The first time I listened to it I thought I had wasted my money, but it grew on me--and quickly. Britney's voice doesn't come across as very strong in the released singles--but she's got it, as some of the, pardon my words, cheesier songs prove. Some of the lyrics lack (""Email my Heart"" is obviously cheesy, but it's a great song if you look past the lyrics), but all the songs are catchy and Spears has a great voice, as I said. I think she was going for a fun album here, not so much one that showed off her vocals. Her next single (From the Bottom of My Broken Heart) and the European release (Born to Make You Happy) are great too. If you like what you've heard on the radio, the CD WILL NOT be a dissapointment."
4,STOP! Go back and buy the Japanese version of this CD!,"Why? Because it's cheaper and it has the SAME EXACT TRACKS as this. Not only that, but the Japanese release comes with a BONUS booklet with pictures, lyrics, credits and more! Don't waste your money on this one and go get the other one. Besides, the cover picture is better on the other one. You see this cover picture everywhere else.So, go search for this:Britney Spears [IMPORT] [EXTRA TRACKS] *The title isn't Baby One More Time; it's called Britney Spears.Get this one if you must, but you will regret it!"
5,Great 90's pop!,"Although I don't love every song on this album, it is undeniably a good bubblegum-pop 90's album. The best songs are:Baby One More TimeYou Drive Me CrazySoda PopIt will definatly take you back to the late 90's! Although I recommend ""Oops! I Did It Again"" as the best Britney album."
5,A Solid Pop Debut,"General opinion seems to be that Britney Spears has minimal vocal talent, and while this may be somewhat true now, it certainly wasn't true at all in 1998 when her debut album was released. Britney has a rich, throaty, even somewhat soulful voice that she uses to full effect on each of these tracks. From great late 90s bubblegum dance song to slow groove ballads, Britney interprets each with ease and without autotune or other vocal effects that seem so prominent now. The songs may be the standard pop fare of the era, but Britney brings them to life."
2,"Original pop, too original!","I don't have to much to say. This debut from the rising star is not her best. Songs like ""...Baby One More Time"" is just the original thing that people or young people would like. I am young, there are better Britney Spears albums than this!"
4,Not too bad....,"There tends to be more bad than good on this cd...I find myself skipping to the next track very often. There are really only a few good playable songs on this cd, and we all know them by now. ...Baby one more time, Sometimes, and You drive me Crazy(Not the STOP! remix. Overall, I do think that you should pick this one up, because it might be worth something someday, its The Pop Princess's First album, and its still has alot of playability."
3,A stairway going down,"I must say this CD starts out really great, with the hits like Sometimes, Crazy and the title track, Baby One More Time. Then after the forth song, Soda Pop it quickly goes downhill with a rather boring album. The beats and lyrics of the rest of the album are quite boring with generalized soft teen pop. Another notable track is the final track called the Beat Goes on."
3,Cool......I guess....,"When I first bought this cd,i was really imoressed with it and my favorite song was the overplayed hit ""....baby one more time"". But now that I listen to it,I am not that impressed with it and I think that her new album is really alot better. The only thing that dissapoints me is that she has changed from her innocent image to this really made over and sexy image. Sexy in a bad way. This cd is good though if you're a really loyal Britney fan."
1,Baby one more time..... Hopefully....,"I think this was her first album ever, and it's worse than Limp Bizkit's third pathetic album. Her vocals are all over the place, and her voice sounds more like a machine than her own voice(That's why she needs the studio, to make her sound good.), and plus, she looks like on the cover likes she's saying, ""I'm the best singer ever. Look at me and applaud, everyone!"" Well, I see no point in applauding her. I see right through those preppy clothes (And I don't need to see through them; Just look on the cover of her 'greatest' hits album...). Stay sane and don't buy this cd. It's not worth it by any means, like all her cd's. Baby, hopefully there won't be one more time for her. She's done."
1,RIGHT ON Pete!,"I definetely agree with you buddy. Pantera kicks the crap outta Britney Spears anytime. She's nothing but an MTV/pop sellout who can't sing or write her own damn songs. Oh by the way, a real funny thing occured to me, you know if you put a certain letter in front of Hit Me Baby One More Time, you've got my exact opinion of this garbage of an album. Frankly all her albums suck."
3,Baby One More Time,1. Baby One More Time 1/52. Crazy (You Drive Me) 4/53. Sometimes 1/54. Soda Pop 4/55. Born To Make You Happy 5/56. From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart 1/57. I Will Be There 5/58. I Will Still Love You 1/59. Deep In My Heart 3/510. Thinkin' About You 4/511. E-Mail My Heart 1/512. The Beat Goes On 2/513. I'll Never Stop Loving You 1/514. Autumn Goodbye 3/515. Baby One More Time (David Ospina Radio MIx) 3/516. Baby One More Time (Boy Wunder Radio Mix) 2/5
1,horrible cd,This cd is horrible. I was expecting a good cd after hearing ...Baby One More Time but her voice sounds so fake and all of her songs are terrible and uncreative.
3,Good Enough...,"While this is most assuredly not anything terrific, it is a fairly decent album and a lot better than her newer songs. If you ever want to hear a Britney tune from before her ego (among other things) exploded, this is where the party's at. Even so, the songs are a little too....faddish. So, my rating is 3 stars."
1,"Britney's work of ""art""","So this America's teen sensation. Exploding on to the music scene with ""Baby One More Time"", she's back again with two brand-new singles and an entire album filled with cheesy, mindless songs. And this is only the beginning. Please, can we say embarrassed? To represent America as ""US Teen Pop Queen"" is a diss! And now she's been nominated for a AMA award, along with Shania Twain and Whitney Houston? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? The bottom line is, she doesn't deserve it! I've listened to this album (thankfully I don't own a copy!) and perhaps the worst songs are ""E-mail My Heart"" and ""Soda Pop"". All the rest are equally annoying, for the mindless 10 and under age group. I suggest you check out the likes of Billie Piper's 'Honey To The Bee' or Jessica Simpson's 'Sweet Kisses'. Please: don't waste your money on this."
1,i dont own it but i HATE it,this album is pure crap it so stupid it is just some dipstickuseing a voice perfecter pop music is the stupidest thing in the hole world buy Metallica's album ... and justice for all. that is WAY better than this crap
2,90% torture to the ears,"Britney Spears is not all she is made out to be. Her voice is nasaly and whiny and she sounds like a little kid. Now, she does have two goods songs - ""Baby one more time"" (doesn't EVERYBODY love that song?) and ""Born to make you happy."" The rest of the songs - especially ""Sodapop"" - are torture to the poor human ears. This album is NOT recommended at all. Christina Aguilera is FAR much more talented."
4,Sexy Britney!!!,"I hope no one thinks I'm gay, but she is a pretty good singer! I received this as a present 10 years ago. I still have it, and sometimes listen to it. My favorite songs are Baby One More Time, and (You Drive Me Crazy) If you love Britney Spears, you'll love ...BABY ONE MORE TIME!!!"
1,"One Killer, Rest Filler","""Baby, One More Time"" is the best song on this album and, with the exception of ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", probably one of Britney's best to date for most of her other singles follow the same pattern: Catchy phrase, play it safe lyrics, and a Janet Jackson ""Rhythm Nation"" beat. The rest of the cd is predictable with a calculated mix of upbeat tunes and lightweight love songs that are designed for the average pre-teen to sing along and practice dance moves to. The majority of the cd is produced by Max Martin who also worked with Swedish teen Robin (""Show Me Love"") who had the chops to carry an average song up a notch. Britney is certainly in lacking in chops but who cares when you have top notch videos, choreographers, stylists and people who write and produce your songs for you."
5,THE best Britney album ever,"I think this album is her best album ever, cuz the songs are soooo catchy and they stay in ur head for a long long time. I sing along with them every day for the past three years and I havent got tired of them.I even bought her next two albums and they are all great. It is mainly about love, but heck! ... it is all teenagers think about...I also dont like the way she dresses, blah blah blah, but her music and voice is plainly GREAT ..."
1,"she may be the queen of pop, but pop sucks","brittany spears has never been good and never will be...honestly i dont know who likes this crap, i go to school and nobody everybody hates her, people who do like her are made fun of constantly cuz there gay although there isnt actually anyone i know of who does.....she cant even sing pop very well,the only reason shes in this business at all is cause shes of her apples and theyre not even all that great....if you like this your either queer or....queer...so go find some real music you faggots....wow brittany spears must have a lot of gay stalkers....."
1,Proof that sex sells,"if everyone about britney spears was the same except she gained 200 lbs, NOBODY would buy her albums. Nobody would buy her posters. if her music videos didn't have trampy- type clothing, nobody would watch them. She is proof that sex sells. Can I ask all you Britney Spears obsessors/stalkers... why do you spend all your time and money on a celebrity who doesnt even know you EXIST!!"
4,She was born to make us happy.,"Britney Spears's debut disc ...Baby One More Time has to be one of the best bubble gum, senseless, and fun albums ever by this arrogant, ungrateful pop princess. Forget about what she looks and sounds like now, on her debut she is cool, surprisely good singer, and has the most catchiest songs ever. Standout tracks include: Born to Make you Happy, Sometimes, From the Bottom of my Broken Heart, Thinkin' About You, E-Mail my Heart, and of course that damn ...Baby One More Time. On the song Soda Pop she sounds and belts like Christina Aguilera, who knew? Ok the songwriting is so childish but hey this was popular back then so don't blame me guys! Britney had real potential back then, too bad all that cigarette smoking, late night partying and destructive behavior shot her voice to hell. Oh well at least we can remember how ""normal and virginal"" she was oh so long ago. Enjoy!"
2,The Kenny G of pop,"Britney Spears is to the pop world what Kenny G is to the jazz world. Hence the same rating. Her music is just mindless ear candy, no substance. The same old, repetitive message in each song. She is not a good role model for young girls; her recent stage shows in which she acts like a stripper and her revealing outfits just goes to prove that.The only thing she has going for her are good looks and a singing voice, although I have heard heard many girls (who are not famous or well-known even) who can sing much better. Granted, some of her songs are catchy and danceable, perfect if you like mindless dance pop. But they soon wear thin."
3,"Cute, sweet, and brainless","I first want to say I am a fan of Britneys', I have both of her albums, but I am the first to admit the songs on this album are empty and shallow,and that Britney does not have a great voice, she sounds like a duck. The first 3 songs are catchy pop, good for when you don't want to have to think too much, the rest of the songs are only halfway decent, ""Soda Pop"", ""E-mail my heart"" and ""I will still love you"", a duet with some no-name, no-talent guy, (Britney sounds like a diva next to this guy) are just plain AWFUL,this album actually has better songs than Oops, and her voice sounds better on this one. If Britney wants a long term career, it is possible, she has the looks and seems like a sweet person, she should just stop concentrating on polishing up her strip club act, and take vocal, instrumental, and songwriting lessons, but if she is not looking for a long term career, just have fun and enjoy yourself for now, because it won't last."
3,I loved it.,"Hi im Mindy Lawson Ellis, My dad just reviewed this cd and i agreed with him. Britney is a great singer. But she's not my roll model. I realy love Britney's music. I just cant stand the way she dresses. It is very sad.Thank you, Mindy Lawson Ellis"
3,Songs and lyrics= excellent.............voice=disappointment,I'm not a singer or anything but I do know when a singer is forcing themselves too much. I think Britney is kindof singing through her nose. but I believe the writers and music people did a good job. The lyrics are really good and the music is great to dance to & the ballards are beautiful. Just get a good singer.
3,It's not her fault,"I agree, this record is really not that great. Her singing is not the real problem here. it's the songwriting and production. With a better selection process while searching for songs, and a producer that can work the music around the artist.....she could show us what she is made of after all."
1,please people.,"while i have been instructed to review this album based on content, i find that rather difficult since there is on content on this cd worthy of notice..especially the grammys...but then again i suppose that is just the state that our musical minds are in right now. i just do not think that the likes of britney spears and company belong there with such artists as santana etc... if you are not a fan of teen pop rock, save yourself some dough."
1,READ THIS,"First of all, the album gets 1 star because I can't give it 0. Second, here's a little anagram/poem that I wrote. It's totally original, unlike Britney's music or chest.Sings like a four year old Plays no instruments. Couldn't beat a tambourine. Expects high pay cuts for other people's songs. Attains a large audience for looking like Barbie. Repetitive garbage that can be written in 2 min. Speaks as if she knows what love's about.I regard that poem as advice, not as humor. Let go of her now. She'll be gone in 2 years anyway."
4,Looking forward to the sequel ...,"As in his first novel, A Scientific Romance, Wright puts a lot of effort into structure: here he deftly melds the memoirs of a nineteenth-century servant of the British raj with a modern-day expedition to French Pacific territory, and he throws in some anti-nuclear-testing politics, a mystery or two, and an uncertain relationship between mother and abandoned child as well. None of it is forced and I enjoyed just about every moment of it. This is serious writing and serious intent. Again (I complained about the same thing in the previous book) the ending didn't work for me; I suppose I was looking for resolution, and perhaps one can't or shouldn't always expect that. An entertaining yarn without being in any way escapist or trivial. When does Amazon.com get Wright's next novel in stock?"
5,Hilarious,I am a teacher and I had read this book to several of my classes. They enjoyed it so much they begged for me to read read it again and again. Then I bought it for my grandsons who also thought it was hilarious!
1,When I Fall in Love,"Excellent album. It is the ultimate Lettermen record made. The cd is clear, you can hear all of the nuances in the harmony that made them so great."
5,Jeff Lorber Fusion - Step By Step,"Shipping was fast. Tracking # was much appreciated. Wish more sellers would do that as standard practice (for both sides of the transaction). Disc in excellent condition. Bonus Tracks on this edition -- hmm -- oh, well -- nothing to jump up and down about. Original tracks great to hear again after these years. Jeff was one of those who helped create the Jazz ""Fusion"" (Jazz, Rock, and Funk) trend back in the late 70's - early 80's. From the University of Miami, he was among some future music artists we know today, i.e. Pat Metheny and Bruce Hornsby. All would later perform on each other's album(s). Check out Jeff's other recordings (if you can find them anymore) such as Wizard Island, Water Sign, Soft Space, or Lift Off."
5,Great Shower Gel,I have very sensitive skin. This is the first shower product I've found that doesn't make my skin dry and itchy. The scent is light and refreshing as well.
3,"Boar is big and durable, but not the star","Hi! I bought a cheap sheet metal version for $[...] at Walmart. Considering the fact that my kids aged 10 & 7 liked this game very much, I went looking for something (i) a little more durable , and (ii) something having the game area, i.e., the star, large enough that moving and placing the marbles is not an issue. After doing a search in other department stores and on the web, I purchased the present unit. The board looks durable and at least 1.5"" thick. Though the overall board measures 19.5"" x 19.2"", the star is a lot smaller, more like 12"" in diameter. As a result picking and placing the marbles is still a problem. There is lot of empty space all around the border. Melissa & Doug may consider increasing the size of the game area, i.e., the star."
3,Problem with marbles,This is a well made product and we have enjoyed teaching our daughters how to play Chinese checkers. It is a wonderful family game that teaches strategy.The problem - it is very difficult to determine the color of the marbles. The see-through colored marbles look dark on the middle black playing area and it makes it hard to tell what color the marbles are. We find ourselves having to hold the marble up towards the light to make sure what color it is. It has been frustrating enough that we no longer play the game. I am now having to shop around to purchase different marbles.
1,Defective board,"This is a nice looking board, but the one I got was defective: the wells for the marbles are not drilled in straight lines. Because of this, you can't tell where you're supposed to be able to move! The game is not usable."
3,A great game but marbles need to be a brighter color,I purchased this game for my grandchildren for Christmas for their home. I have a metal version of this game. I like the fact the the game had an edge around the side so the marbles would not fall off but the main problem is that the marbles are not a bright color and begin to look alike as you play. The bag to connect to the board was also nice. The game would be much more interesting if it were more colorful.
5,"Thank goodness for ""Old Time"" Games--not electronic",I try to give my grandchildren toys and games from my childhood and my children's childhood. They still appreciate them and play them with their friends and families. Melissa and Doug makes excellent quality wooden products. I always try to buy their products.
4,good album,"I'm sitting on a tour bus, working musician, and this is a very good album for watching the world go by. Not quite on par with the Yellowjacket's ""Greenhouse"" cd, or ""Bill Evans With Symphony Orchestra"", but a 3 1/2 to 4 star rating for what it is. Some nice crunchy harmonic things going on."
1,"""The Mis-Accounting...""","A better title for the book should be, ""The Mis-Accounting...""The above review is promotional propaganda from someone who knows nothing of the 25th BG history. The book contains many, many errors. The deceased writer purged the name of a researcher, and published this researchers work, including his errors and bogus information, without acknowledgement.Aviation researchers are ""forwarned"" to check official USAAF documents and records to verify information before quoting anything from this book. One author ""ruined"" several Mosquito books referencing information and errors from ""An Accounting..."" Plans are in progress to detail on a web site, every error appearing in this book. It will also include errors that ""ruined"" the several Mosquito books and articles mentioned above.I recommend this book be destroyed immediately, otherwise history will be changed forever.Norman Malayney"
3,"Contains dairy, no mention in description.m","If there's one problem ordering supplements on amazon, it's the lack of ingredients and allergen listings. The bottle states ""vegetarian capsules"" but contains dairy (casein). This information is not available in amazon's listing. Vegetarians and those sensitive or allergic to dairy would be advised not to order."
5,I seem to have more energy,"I am very low in Ferritin and I had everything from low energy, fatigue and worsened Hypothyroid symptoms. I take this with a vitamin C tablet or Orange Juice for better absorption. I read good reviews about this product and although I haven't had my Ferritin level re-checked yet, I notice more energy when I am taking this. I am pregnant and still taking it."
3,Not What I Expected - But Good Analogies,"This book was recommended by a friend who uses 'Market Profile' in his trading. I was disappointed that the book appears to be a photocopy of a PDF document, with a cover. The content is interesting, and is presented in an understandable way, but as the text is an image copy, it is lighter in some places and darker in others. The charts are not on the same page or facing page as the description (sometimes needing to flip 1-2 pages to find the chart the author is talking about). The author creates names for conditions and traders, ex. 'Other Timeframe Traders' = Traders holding positions overnight. The analogies are well written, which lend to a greater understanding of the concepts taught. This book is not about trading strategies or trading methods, but rather about how to determine the price area where most of the trades on a particular issue are occurring during the trading day."
1,mind over markets:power trading with market generated information by James F Dalton,"This book supplies much in formation not easily found elsewhere.I can appreciate many of the positive comments made earlier by other reviewers,and would have given a higher rating, EXCEPT.The paperback edition is printed in a light ink with smallish type , and tries to fit too much information into some of the figures at the expense of losing clarity and legibility. As well, the number of contradictions and mistakes is too high. The book needs quality proofreading and editing.Paul Bellhouse, Tugun, Queensland, Australia"
1,nonsense,"The markets are far more complex than what is taught in this book. More is hidden than is revealed by the nonsense of overlapping either a volume of time based Profile. Nothing beyond Steidlmayer and Koy's first book ""Markets and Market Logic"" was necessary in this arena whether you agree with the value of Market Profile or not."
1,Not for everyone.,"I bought this on recommendation from a friend, what rubbish. Does this guy really know what he is talking about? Its far to complex, and contains too many opinions."
5,One of the best trading books,"If not the best.I have read a lot of trading books and allready been in the futures market for 2 years, and this is the only book that realy, practically, helped me in my trading.Some say is better than Peter Steidlmayer's books and I agree. Is more concrete related to day trading and how to actualy use market profile in day trading and beyond."
3,Great info but poorly written,"Market Profile's bible according to many. There are some parts that I've read and reread many times. Overall, it's way too technical and boring. The book makes 7th grade material a study for rocket scientists.Lots of charts but they're rarely if ever opposite the page referring to them and usually they're 3-4 pages away. Aggravated me.I would not reccomend this book except that there's not much out there on MP. So if you're bound to study MP, then it's probably worth reading."
5,Best.Rock.Band.Ever.,"Since The Ramones split up anyway, if you like Punk or hard rock, check this band out, the recent DVD is awesome too."
4,My review of Just Lost,I think the book is very good. I liked reading it. The book gave a lot of information about not getting lost and what to do if you get lost. If you are ever lost in a mall you need to go to an adult and tell them that you are lost or that your mom is lost. I also like the pictures that are in the book. The pictures helped to make the book interesting
3,Avoid This Product. Parts Missing Manufacturer wont help!,I ordered 2 of these peddlers they only enclosed one tension adjust knob.They manufacturer swears they were completely assembled. Not True.The one knob was enclosed in a small plastic bag.I've wasted much time trying to get them to solve this problem evenoffering to buy the second tension knob which they wont do. Avoidthis peddler or any product from Drive Medical.**Update** The manufacturer did eventually send the missing partsand I'm happy with the product. I'll give it 3 stars now..
5,Great Product,I bought this bird food in 3 sizes to meet all my birds needs and this food fits the bill. All of my birds eat it and there is no waste. I highly recommend this food for all birds. Great name brand means great food.
2,"Review of Genesis ""Original Album""","If you are not a Genesis fan, but want to hear the first album, get this one. It is the only CD of ""From Genesis To Revelation"" (there are millions of reissues of ""From Genesis To Revelation"") with six bonus tracks, rather than four. The bonuses are ""The Silent Sun"" (NOT ""Silent Sun"", there are two different versions), ""That's Me"", ""Winter's Tale, ""One-Eyed Hound"", ""Image Blown Out"" and ""She's So Beautiful"". The last two mentioned are the 2 previously unreleased tracks. They are good, but it sounds as if Pete is singing them with a lisp! But that's OK. The remaining tracks on the album are a very unique type of music."
3,Gabriel in the young days..,"These are some of the first Genesis songs. Its great to be able to have this.There are glimpse of what to come in some of the songs...but most dont have thatspecial elements that makes your pulse race when you hear them.Im glad i have a copy, no regrets.Recommended for serious Genesis fans."
2,Blood-Red Rivers,"I read this book in the original during a recent French holiday and as it has become a best seller in France I planned to do an English translation. However, I now find that Mr. Monk has beaten me to it ! A pity as I think that this easily matches the action and suspense of, for example, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" or similar, at least for the first two hundred pages. I found the two lead characters engaging if relatively stereotypical and the plot is initially intriguing as it promises to involve neo-nazis, genetics, cloning, mad scientists etc. However,the novel runs out of steam about half way through,becomes muddled and over long and the ending, or ""denouement"" if you will, is a total anti-climax. In a way,in retrospect, I am rather glad I didn't have to translate it after all !....END"
5,A Classic,"If you love poetry, fun, and are up for a laugh this book is for you! The poems are timeless, familiar, and remind you that being a kid is the best time of your life."
4,"An exciting, fictional, escape into our nations past.","Mr. Coyle has outdone his self. Using historical events coupled with imaginative characters, he creates fictional reality that few authors achive. The interjecting of famous and sometimes infamous personalities and dialogue into the story allow the fictional Bannon brothers to accurately flow through historical events. Understand and feel the opinions of the time as supporting charectors Southern and Yankee express their feelings about the conflict and its impact on their lives. Adding depth to the famous Bannon family (Team Yankee fame) has only added to my enjoyment of Mr. Coyle's work.An exciting escape into our nations past, well researched, well written, well worth the read."
5,This is NOT a Civil War soap opera!,"If you have any appreciation at all for American History,this is a must read. The story of the Bannon brothers isa wonderfully told account of the courage and bravery that was the hallmark of the Civil War. One brother Union, the other Confederate, the story unfolds through incomprehensible fear and destruction to a riveting climax that will have you wiping the sweat from your brow."
1,"Not Worth the money, used or new",A RightWingNut Christian who probably thinks President Bush is the Jesus Christ come back to earth. Full of so much clap trap and Right Wing platitudes that Timothy McVey would have loved this book.Save your money.
1,Closed-Minded Paranoia.......,"This is ghastly stuff. I bet the the Anti-Defamation League, ACLU, Hate Monitor, and other organizations would love to have a go at this.......I'm not surprised that the author touts himself as a big game hunter. Clearly it is not enough to get off merely bashing gays and Liberals etc. One has to resort to big-game hunting. What an anachronism........yawn.........."
1,doug giles is a freaking moron,"i tried to read this book, but can't get past his efforts to be all 'manly' all the time. he is clearly a homophobe. he thinks we should all revert to cavemen christians and push everyone around who doesn't believe the same things he does. don't like it? don't have the 'nads'(a word he uses alot, by the way) to be an annoying, in yer face conservative blowhard? then shove it!"
2,Over-rated...,"After reading a few of the reviews, I was very excited about getting this item at the low price. I have experienced lower than reported distance. While approximately 30ft is reported, I can walk about 10-15ft away before experiencing static and then losing the signal. After a few weeks the earpiece began to experience inconsistent connections when making and receiving phone calls. After about 6 weeks with the product, connectivity has stopped completely. While the earpiece does come on, connectivity with my phone has been limited at best. On a positive note, set up for the earpiece was pretty easy."
3,Meh...,"Let me begin by saying the Indigo Girls are fabulous...all of the songs on this CD are great as well. However, this CD does not fully capture the Girls' depth or spirit. For listeners new to the Indigo Girls, this might be a good buy, it is a ""greatest hits"" collection after all. But, I'd recommend 1200 Curfews over 4.5 any day. 1200 Curfews will give you a taste of the Girls' best work and their best live shows while 4.5 will show you what the critics view as their best songs."
4,Great Stuff!!,"I am totally psyched to have found this CD! The Indigo Girls are incredible! If you are going to own only one of their albums, this is it. A true Ingigo Girls lover will own all their albums, but this is a fabulous mixture of their most meaningful songs. You really get a feel for what they are all about. I purchased two & gave one to my sister. She can't stop listening to it. We wish they added Chickenman to it, but this is DEFINATELY a must have!! Don't live another day without it!!!!"
4,O.K. I still wonder why these fools think this books soo bad,"It was O.K. as I already said. There are a few mature scenes but nothin' to worry about. I thought this was the best book in the Bauder's Gate series. Action-packed, dragons come into play... The main character's name (I forget since its been a while since I read this book) destroys all the other Bhaalspawn. Not terrific. I haven't read many Forgotten Realms books; I'm more into the DL (Dragonlance) books. Those who haven't read this novel and ANY other books in this series and any of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman novels should.<"
2,My thoughts.,"I think the book speaks for itself, it's well writen, but the deaths of both Imoen and Jaheira are inecessary, and painful, not only to the character but to the reader, it makes no sens that once the character has nothing left to life for he would not chose to become a god, if even just to help those people who are hurt and wounded instead of returning to a life of nothingness. Jaheira's death most of all is extremely painful to all the readers, the writer had virtually no right to kill the character Philip Athans put so much work into from the begining of the series, they had the right to live happilly ever after. The book is good so far as pacing, language and events. But I SERIOUSLY call Drew Karpyshyn's morbid mentality to question."
1,Disappointment,"This book comes nowhere close to telling the wonderful story of the computer game. I was so disappointed that I could not finish this horrible book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you want to know the story, buy the game, not this book."
1,Worst book I ever read.,"I want to start off saying this book was horrible. First of all in the first three pages the amount amount of blood spilled would have made Dracula himself throw up. I'm completely positive that the author didn't play the game and the author only had a small list of the main events. I would expect more talent in writing in a five year old child. The only detailed parts was in a. The fight scenes and b. making love (With many DIFFERENT women mind you!). The author surely is a pervert. Not to mention he completely changed Jaheira's deity, thus making her completely different. Any person who would rate this book a five star is surely being bribed by the author. Maybe the author has better books, but if he does he certainly did not show it here!"
3,Not the best in Zack Files,My 5 year old son loves the Zack Files series. This particular episode did not keep his interest as well as the others we have read. Maybe it was a little beyond his understanding. I highly recommend the other books in the series.
1,The binding quality is very poor,"I've just started reading the book and i realized the pages are being left, i mean, the binding isn't good enough to keep the pages fixed. The pages isn't hold together and i am missing them. Bad quality"
2,"Process Mapping, Process Improvement and Process management by Dan Madison","The content is informative and helpful. However, the bookbinding is very poor. The book arrived yesterday (06/22/2011). I read it over for 3 hours last night, and many of pages have fallen apart already. Note, I didn't do any acrobatic while reading the book. I am very disappointed to pay $22.45 for this book. This book should cost around $4.00. Amazon should send me $18 refund."
5,A must have for starting with process improvement,"This book has all you need not only to start, but also to continue with process improvement. It covers all basic steps you need to fulfill, gives you a broad overview about what you have to have in mind and also gives nice examples. I'm sorry I didn't have it much before, it could save me a lot's of mistakes I did.Of course, I wouldn't call it a Bible, for more details in any area you'll need more detailed literature, but it can be used as a very good checkbook and guide when starting with process improvement. It's very simple and systematic. Highly recommendable not only for those who start with process management, but also for everyone who already works in this area."
2,One Big Gap,"While the book addresses a number of relevant topics, it simply fails to address the topic of notation. How do you expect to publish a book on this subject without address BPMN???? Business Process Management NOTATION is the language of processing mapping that includes gateways, swimlanes, tokens and pools and the author simply elects to bypass this subject."
2,"If you have Smile Live, pass this up.","I love Boris as much or more than you do. I was very excited to get this release and it was quite a disappointment. It somehow manages to have more cuts than frames. It's constant cuts. Nothing is visible for more than a fraction of a second, making it nauseating to watch. The audio quality is great as are the performances, but I bought a DVD to, ya know, *watch* it."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I purchased the Kindle edition of this book because it looked interesting. I was hoping to gain a better understanding of the bully (and victim) mentality. After reading 65% of the book I couldn't read any more. The content seemed too outdated, mundane and repetitive. I just couldn't read any more. If a book like this interests you I would recommend to research bullying on Google first. There are plenty of sites with RELEVANT information for free."
4,One of my favs from Emporer,"Overall, one of my favs from their discography. Equilibrium IX is prolly the best, but this one is good as well."
4,a very good album,"anthems to the welkin at dusk is a very good album.It's not the best album of Emperor but it's one the best.If you want a good black metal album,buy this cd."
4,Emperor: Darkness on the attack,"Emperor returns with ""Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk"", a blurring whirlwind of Black mayhem. Fast, aggressive guitar and drums accented with keyboard and melded with Ihsahn's underlying vocals. Though at times Ihsahn is a bit hard to hear, this is a great album. END"
3,"Good CD, Terrible Production.","I got this cd after hearing nothing but good about Emperor and being a fan of Zyklon(featuring Samoth and Trym) I decided to pick it up. The intro(The Oath) really got my attention cause it sounded so strange and evil. Then the real songs began and I was impressed by the powerful drums and the thrashing guitars, but there was one MAJOR PROBLEM. You can barely hear the vocals. I even put my CD player on the function where the vocals are the loudest. They are so hard to hear that it just sounds like background noise. This was a major disapointment. However, it is still a good cd and I recommend it if you can stand the poor production."
1,SNORE,"Emperor is nothing but a guy who can't sing or scream, coupled with a drummer who doesn't know anything other than blast beats, and two guitarists that you can't even hear under Trym's constant pounding. Emperor's lackluster attempt to reignite old metal guitar riffs by marketing them to the 'evil' satanic crowd falls short miserably. I'd rather record myself farting and put it on replay instead of hearing this 'black metal' jizzunk. BTW Ihsahn isn't smart, he's an idiot and he looks like a choir boy."
2,What happened?,"After I got this CD I played track 5 (Reverence) first and I knew the rest of the CD was going to be lame. The songs have no direction and the music itself is just some sort of 'progressive' exercise in the melodic black metal sound. It's as if some music students in college decided to write a melodic bm CD but had no real insight as to what they want to acheive. I listened to the whole thing a couple of times and I haven't listened to it since. It's too 'gothic' for me as well.My version came with a video, 3 tracks from the Reverence MCD, and a live track. I gave it two stars because the CD is lame, but it's not a complete waste."
2,PUTRID!,"Yay! Now all the kiddies can have a bm opener that even GRANDMOTHER will like!But seriously, this CD is bordering on pointless as a best of should include the first two records and forget the existence of the garbage that flowed from Isahns mind from then on.Another waste of time. Buy some Burzum or Von instead."
2,Emperor - 'Anthems To The Welkin At Duck' (Century Media),"Review no.115.Emperor is described by some,as one of THE best ever black metal bands to come along.They come to us from Oslo,Norway.However in my most humble opinion,I didn't think they had much to offer.Didn't really care for any of the tunes especially.Perhaps this CD is too 'evil' for me.But,don't get me wrong,if you happen to enjoy this genre yourself,listen to the sound clips provided and decide for yourself.Just when you think you've seen it all:SCANDINAVIAN DEATH M-E-T-A-L!!What'll they think of next?"
1,EEEK - what was this?,"After having completely become mad when i first heard In the Nightside Eclipse, i just waited impatiently the second Emperor LP... and then it came..and then i was about to throw up when i finished hearing it...waht was that?? this is an awful-souding album..worst of all..boring! i couldn't believe it..i just think it is the album which marked the end of the great age of black metal...every Emperor fan should NOT own this album or the following ones which are maybe worse... who cares about emperor now?"
4,Pretty good...bad production.,"Amazing instrumentals in this CD. It's extremely orchestral and symphonic yet maintains its metal edge at the same time. The only complaint I'd give is that the production stinks. You can hardly hear the vocals. You do get used to it after awhile, but it isnt too pleasant at first. But I'd recommend this album anyway since it has some goddamn amazing riffs, orchestral sounds, and symphonic layouts to it."
5,it kills,"anthems to the welkin at dusk is THE best black metal album of all time,..it's far more interesting than their debut ""in the nightside eclipse"",because now emperor has managed to forget all the usual bm image,..the music speaks for itself,...there are six anthems of pure nordic terror,and into and outro,both as great as you can imagine....if you like this album,you should check out the limbonic art's ""in abhorrence dementia"",..i have also heard that tartaros' ""the grand psychotic castle"" is like these two masterpieces in many ways,...."
5,An essential album for any black metal collection,"Whether or not this is ""true"" black metal doesn't really matter because either way, this is an amazing cd from start to finish. The vocals, synth, drums, guitars, and bass all blend together fantastically to create a classic album in black metal history that makes it easy to understand why many bands have been inspired by the mighty Emperor. Although the songs don't quite contain the raw feeling of Emperor's earlier work, this is a more refined Emperor. The bonus tracks on the Candlelight re-release are a nice addition as well. Anyway, this is one cd that no metal fan should be without as it will always be remembered as a genre defining classic."
5,Deep in its Evil Madness shall have one medolic sprit.......,"As everoyone know the magical wonders of Emporor, this album once again shows how true Black Metal is all about. Some people hate Black Metal bands with syphonic melodies, but whatever, BMetal has Matured and its grwoing to its greater stage. This Album has so much whirling guitar and and Mind Blowing Double Based Drums, and the very unique sound of an orhestra. This is A MUST BUY for Emperor fans and Black Metal. Dont just download it and Burn it to a CD, buy it....ITS a MUST own collection..This album first starts off with a Evil Medolic sound of ""Alsvatr"" then bangs in with ""Ye Entrancemperium"". Emperor has some what of a way that makes you want to just bang your head over and over and then dream into there soft melodies. Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk was my first Black Metal album and one of my Top faviorte of all Black Metal."
5,"My first Emperor CD (and the best, IMO)","I found this CD at a used CD shop in town (and I'm still wondering to this day, who would sell such a masterpiece) and I immediatly picked it up. The version I got had ""The Loss And Curse of Reverence"" video (which is so badass!!) and another bonus track. I think Ihsaun's vocals are at there best on this album, Trym's drumming is absolutely mind boggling (as always), and Samoth's guitar work is absolutely brilliant. ""Anthems"" has some of Emperor's best songs, in my opinion, Thus Spake the Nightspirit, Alsavtr (The Oath), With Strength I burn, and The Loss and Curse Of Reverence. Don't get me wrong though, the whole album is wonderful. Anyhoo, there isnt much more I can say about this album (or Emperor, in that case), just go buy it and see for yourself. Peace!"
2,Maybe I just don't get it...,"The album's got a cool cover and original song titles. But when opened and spun, this is simply another angry blast of tunes by a band throughly bent on creating a sheer wall of sound. Ihsahn's vocals are hidden under the irregular thumping of the double bass blastbeat and the incredibly horrific guitar sound. Seems to be all the rage. Most metal this brutal is covered with vocals that sound like dying cats or burping frogs. This lies somewhere between the two. I gave this disc a couple of listens anyway, just because I thought I might have missed something the first time around. I don't think I did. The prince of darkness probably spins the disc with a smile on his face. Must admit, these chaps have the evil thing down, but it's just not my gig."
3,Add a half star...,"I don't mind the 'wall-o-sound' style of production as long as there's clarity in the wall. There's very little clarity in this wall. Vocals are buried, guitars lack definition, the drums are unevenly mixed, and so on...The songs are very well crafted and what can be heard of the individual performances is top-notch, but the uneven production warrants this one only 3 stars. Oh well, they still got my money!;)(Many months later...)Repeated listenings have altered my opinion and I now find this cd essential. Still not a fan of it's production, but the songwriting gives it it's incredible strength."
4,Anthems to Samoth and Ihsahn at Dusk,"Samoth and Ihsahn are the only two members remaining in Emperor, but that's ok. I don't like the first track, reminds me of a Led Zepp song or something. There are only a handful of good Black Metal songs and the others sound Cradle of Clowns' material. This is truely Emperor's last good album. Overall its ok, but the early grimness and hatred of early Emperor is much more enjoyable."
1,HYPE but shite,"this really is a disappointment. Emperor seem to have lost their individual sound for a more accessible and generic black metal sound. This is the most overrated black metal album I've ever heard, don't believe the kiddy's who've read their Metal Maniacs and dismiss this as genius. Hyped to death, this really isn't that good and only interesting maybe once or twice around. The bald ostrich Isahn's vocals are really weak and the drumming overwhelms the mediocre music ridiculously. I'm sure all the new wave BM kiddies will want to kill me for this review, I'll take Transylvanian Hunger over these metal megalo-maniacs any day. screw you emperor!"
1,Do Not Purchase,"This microscope has neither a built in light, nor any optional magnification options. It is therefore very difficult for any child to use. Magnification is fixed and depnding on what the child is attempting to see this magnification is likely to be too high (for larger specimens) or too small for very small specimens.I suggest that both a light and a choice of magnification are absolutely essential. This microscope has neither."
5,Great!,"I bought this microscope for my 11 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. Its got a very lightweight design and is easy to carry around. Even with only a mirror as a light source, it still has great lighting (you either need to be viewing in a very well-lit room or in a sunny area.) This microscope is good for anybody looking for a cool new ""toy."" Great for all ages."
3,Movies are just ok,"We bought this to watch with our kids and it's just been ok. We thought Home Alone was funnier as we watched it when we were younger, but watching it with the kids it really wasn't. And they really didn't like A Christmas Carol--too scary. We'll probably just sell it next year."
5,Favorite Christmas Movies!,I was so happy to see all of my favorite Christmas classics in one set for a great price! Would have preferred plastic cases though over the paper/cardboard.
5,Best Deodorant I've Found,I bought this although it is expensive because the smell is a lemon verbena-esque scent which is lovely and I haven't used anything else since. It works on sweating as well as keeping you fresh. The best thing about it is no white stuff on your clothes. I am surprized that Amazon has it as 47.00! It costs around $16.00 in the L'Occitane store.....
2,Enjoyable but inaccurate.,"I liked this book but found mistakes. I feel that I can not always trust definitions or explanations submitted by Mr. Almond. Two examples would be ""bull pen"" and thimble. It has some very interesting information but should be double checked."
2,Dictionary Of Word Origin,This book is okay but I thought it would be thicker and have more words in it.
3,Decent resource for writers & coaches,Word derivation is a good resource to have on your bookshelf. It's also a good resource to have in doing self-development work where you are asked to create your own motto or vision statement. It's a good resource for writers and for career counselors.
3,as a failed lexicographer,"i should hesitate to criticize a fellow drudge in the ditch of language, but Professor Almond's definition of the phrase TIPS was used on a local radio show as an acronym for To Insure Prompt Service. ...but professor almond's book seems to be popular, i have yet to catch it unchecked out at our local libraryonwardpete saussy/george stone saussy iii, compiler of the Oxter English Dictionary/Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Words/The Logodaedalian's Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Words [all pretty much the same book and out of print]"
1,"Preppy, Soulless, Square, Camp & Funny as Hell!!","Ok, it is so easy to find this type of washed out anaemic pop funny but this preppy folk-pop is a must for comedy fans!Everything sounds so sterile and self satisfied. It has to be one of the most flavorless and soulless recordings I've heard.The highlight has to be their rendition [abomination] of the classic Roberta Flack Jazz ballad 'First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"". Roberta's definitive Jazz ballad arrangement, phrasing and heartfelt version is so soulful and moving to the core. Here its reduced to a sterile hot mess.Its so typical of a lot of these mainstream pop acts who try to sound sincere and 'from the soul' but just sound contrived, soulless, camp and cheezey! [Judy Garland, all the Seegers, Andy Williams, George Michael, Joss Stone etc.] Long term listening may seriously have a toxic effect on the brain cells. It would have made me contemplate self harming but its just too damn [unintentionally] hilarious!!"
1,Cannot use this book in Europe.,"As I have the new German manuals about Biochemie nach Dr. Schüssler written by Thomas Feichtinger, this very old book about Dr Schuessler's Biochemistry by J.B.Chapman and J.S. Cogswell was a waste of money for me.It is a copy of a very old book, something I did not see in the information given by amazon before I ordered it.In addition to that the names of the tissue salts used in this book are different from the ones we use in Europe."
5,Dr. Schuesller's Biochemistry book,Book arrived in great shape and in a well protected container. I was happy with its condition.
2,Not Enough Detail,"I wanted to get a strong but basic overview of all the features of Photoshop. Based on other reviews I thought this book would be great. The section on filters tells you what filters are available, but doesn't go through the differences between any of them. The theme throughout most of the book is: Play with all of them to see what the differences are and if you make a mistake, there's always the Edit>Undo command. If this is the way you want to learn, don't bother buying the book. I was very disappointed."
5,An excellent primer,"Michelle Perskins' Beginner's Guide To Adobe Photoshop, 3rd Edition provides an excellent basic set of structured lessons to help beginners with photography background enter the digital world of Photoshop editing. Here are foundation lessons on everything from rendering and resolution to file formats and working with image enhancements. Combine these with basics on how to remove dust, dirt and scratches from a picture and you have an excellent primer."
5,Great Beginner Guide to Photoshop,This is a great beginners guide to Adobe Photoshop. The author takes the time to explain all of the important tools in this comprehensive software program. You will certainly gain many valuable insights in how to improve your photographs.
1,Awful,Don't buy the frame. It's 4 separate pieces of cheap plastic with not clear plastic piece to cover the picture itself. I bought 4 prints from this same seller at the same time and all four prints came out extremely grainy. All they did was blow up an extremely low resolution original. For a retailer selling art (even extremely cheap art) the least they could do is sell at a decent resolution. I will not buy from again and I encourage others to not make the mistake I made.
1,Never got it!!,"Order from Amazon, get product from different places with additional shipping and handling from each and then never get the product. Hard to see any value in this at all."
4,Helpful resource,"This book is a very good desk reference of genetic terminology. There are useful illustrations and references after each section, and wonderful ""quick reference"" tables in the back of the book."
4,not as useful as I thought it would be,"this is a good reference, but is a bit terse and is not the answer to my genetic woes."
5,Book purchase review,Book was exactly as described.....very good condition! I did well to purchase from Amazon.com!
1,"Good music, bad recording!","There's no doubt: This is good music, but a really bad recording. The master tapes are too old, 30's to 50's. I think the engineers make their best effort to have a good sound in this 3-cd box, but was impossible. I'll be glad to return the cd back!"
4,You should see his new stuff...,"This book is good, but his latest work is much more powerful. You can read some of his latest poems at his site, http://www.duanesposito.com"
3,The Frog's Throat Bubble,"The Book of Bubba, by Duane Esposito, is an attempt to give voice to trauma that is, perhaps, beyond words. These poems offer emotional guts that the craft has not quite lived up to. However, a few gems rise in the middle of this book-length confession. A poem like ""Puking From Bear Mountain"" or lines like ""Im a magic slippery man / on the hitting field of love."" Moments of poetic clarity & insight.I like the book for its ""struggle to reunite"" & recommend it for the crazed poet/reader. As a work, The Book of Bubba hasn't fully arrived, but I say keep an eye & ear out for future works by Duane Esposito"
3,new ground,"Yes, this latest by Ruth Rendell is breaking new ground forher, and we can understand her interest in exploring newterritory, but this story doesn't have the tight plotting andexciting mysteries of her famous Inspector Wexford series.This one is more of a ""psychological thriller"" than mystery,and it suffers by the exclusion of a mystery component.An interesting story, but we have to hope the author returnsto her justly-famous mysteries and gives us another winner."
5,Engaging and Entertaining,"""Bookends"" reveals a talent of the author, Liz Curtiz Higgs, that is nice to find in Christian Romance Novels. The characters are engaging and entertaning. Best of all, you do not have to wait till the end of the story for the main characters to have fun together! In this book the stroyline is creatively weaved with humor, seriousness, and romance, from begining to end. I highly recomend it to those who enjoy quality, intelligent, romance/comedy novels."
4,Good read!,"The book started very well. It was hilarious and grabbing me from the first page.But then the story slowed down a bit and was less funny. The book continued to be a light read, but I was longing for a bit more. This book is for everyone who is looking for a light read without emotions pulled out.It's very well written. This is a great contemporary novel!"
5,This book will make you smile!,"This is a great book. I loved all the ""situations"" the characters got themselves into. I was sorry to see it end. I hope there will be a sequel so we can find out what happens next. I also liked the recipe at the end of the book, I plan on trying it, I'm sure it is good. If you like books to lift your spirit this is it."
2,Disappointed :(,"I thoroughly enjoyed other novels by this talented author. While her writing style is easy to read and entertaining, the ""opposites attract"" message was overdone, the predictability of the story genuinely disappointing, and the lack of information about the main character's development of her hardened heart sorely missing. Prince Charming was over to the top (yes, we all see the parallel between him and Christ but come on folks). Big letdown after Thorn in My Heart."
4,Great,It is strongly recommended to read this book for a fundemental understanding of neutrino problems
5,"*Educational, personal and entertaining... well-written....*","I am not a dialysis patient but a good friend of mine is and I really got a lot out of this book. David keeps his story on a light and informative note. His endurance and strength are an inspiration to many people who have to deal with illnesses or even with everyday life challenges. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to anyone who needs a boost and a few hours of quiet time and reflection. Thank you for sharing your story, David."
1,out dated!!,"I bought this for my husband, who has CRF. He asked me to get rid of it!!The information is so out of date & depressing. He was so upset by it, it freaked me out. Anyone thinking about transplants will be so confused because it is so out of date."
1,learn autocad LT 2002,"screen shots of text are most times very small.a basic book should cover paperspace it's real important.region modelling, accessing autodesk's portals, drawings on the web, do not seem necessary for a introductory level book.index d on compatibility with autocad 2002 seems misplaced for a new student to autocad. where is the meat and potatoes for a new student."
1,No CD included,"This was a total waste of time and money. I bought it for the demo version included on the CD. Well I got the book, but the CD was gone. What a scam."
3,WW II Scare time,"It was the early 40s and the German threat was real. The movie portrays the German spies trying to disrupt America. Fair enough. I did not care for the too frequent, ""witty"" dialogue. Much of the same cast as Casablanca but not even close to the quality of story or film. If you are a Bogart fan you'll want to see it to say that you saw it, but that is about all."
2,To Easy.,Boy in Darkness was not challenging at all. After you met all of the characters it was touch and go with no real plot. The characters (even the hero) had no depth to them and were plain and shallow. The physical descriptions were stunning and is a good idea for a plot but is not fully developed. I would not give it higher than two stars.
5,My favorite Susan Fox book,"This book started my Susan Fox collection and is my all-time favorite of her novels.From the back cover:A practical marriage?Cade Chalmers knew he was playing with fire by attempting to live under the same roof as Colleen. But he was desperate: Cade needed to share custody of his orphaned niece and nephew with her. The trouble was, each time he was alone with Colleen for even a minute, they clashed...It wasn't just antagonism--it was explosive attraction. Cade decided he simply had to bite the bullet--the best thing for the children would be for him and Colleen to marry. It was a purely common-sense proposal, but the result was fireworks."
5,WOW!!,"This was so much more than I had anticipated..Honestly I didn't know what to expect, I just had a ""feeling"" I would not be sorry. I was not. Well, maybe sorry I hadn't purchased it sooner, but happy I was drawn to it."
1,Misleading use of photo,"The African children on this ship are not their way into the nightmare of slavery in America, as Prof West has claimed prominently in the national media: the Tavis Smiley show, among other venues. Nor are they on a slave ship at all -- or anywhere near the Atlantic Ocean.They are instead on the British HMS Daphne in the Indian Ocean, on their way back to Africa. They have been rescued by the Daphne, which apparently sank the Arab slaving dhow on which they were bound, and took their original captors (see the turbans, upper right) on board as well.Proper documentation from the British National Archives of the 1868 event:[...]There are so many other searing images Dr. West could have used. Why undermine all scholarly credibility?"
5,This CD never gets old.,We love this CD. Dr. Cornel West and the other artists dropped some serious knowledge on tracks with some funky beats. The messages are in the music. I hope you enjoy this as much as we have. My 10 year old son has listened to this since he was 8 and he doesn't have an interest for the foolish and ignorant hip-hip that most of his peers listens to.
5,HD Radio Rocks!,"I purchased this unit after buying a Kenwood radio. I love HD radio and this unit is plug and play! I love it. If you can find one, I highly recommend it."
5,this is the best punk rock the south bay has to offer!,"THIS CD ROCKS! I've seen these guys in concert enough times to tell you this is the best punk rock coming out of southern CA right now.You'll love every song on here, especially victim and swiss radio. Keep an eye out for their new CD DRIVEN that was just released."
2,Smelly!,Absolutely no fragrance added. Has a very chemical / musty smell like the shampoo. It's embarrassing to have your head smell like this. I had to throw both away. Very disappointed
5,love this CorningWare bowl,"I love this size of 16 oz. CorningWare with a plastic cover for storing. It's aperfect size for soups, small serving just right to eat less."
2,Pretty Raw Stuff,"Let me start out by saying I am one of THE BIGGEST Split Enz fans of all time. If you're looking for a lost gem that compares to the greats of Dizrhytmia, True Colours, or Waita, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this isn't quite it. The engineering / mixing isn't the highest quality and reminds me of some of the early Australian releases of Mental Notes, etc that didn't compare to the US remixes (see Second Thoughts). With that said, if you are a diehard fan that always wants more of the Finns & company, buy it. It is classic Split Enz with all the percussion instruments and you will enjoy it. Just remember the production qualities are not quite up to snuff."
2,The first Split Enz CD is the last one to get,"I love the SPlit Enz and have all of their CDs, including all but 3 of the 2006 remasters. I did not get remasters of this (or their last album, See Ya Round) because they just are not very good albums. Beginning of The Enz sounds like a band in search of a sound. Some of the songs ended up reworked and improved on Mental Notes and Second Thoughts. Start with Second Thoughts and Dizrythmia, then check out Conflicting Emotions and Time and Tide before you go back to The Beginning of the Enz."
4,"Not Quite ""Instant""","The capsules did not quite dissolve instantly, the majority of them took a few minutes, a handful took a little longer but they all ultimately dissolved and turned into the shapes they were supposed to. Fun to spend some time with on a rainy day!"
2,jtmom,"These are advertised to be instantly dissolving, yet they do not fully dissolve when submerged in water for over 24 hours. I purchased these to use for a lab and was not able to do so. If you are wanting these for anything other than a toy, do not use."
1,Where's Johnny?,"I was looking for an old song of his and listened to the new ones. I greatly enjoyed some of his old songs but don't think that I would take this if it was given to me. Sorry, Johnny!! I wished that I still had an old eight track so I could listen to his old songs. I would buy a CD but none so far have ""Turn around, Look at me"". Maybe I am not remembering the right title of the song."
4,a real beginning,"i though this book was great. ms. williams illustrates, in a real-world fashion, a means to breaking down racial stereotypes. her methods of gathering a small group of racially mixed people together to OPENLY speak about their own racial prejudices is so ""commom sense"" and yet so little used. i believe that this book can and should be used as a 'icebreaker' of sorts in order to get poeple to honestly commumicate with one another. thank you ms. williams for honesty."
1,"May I Suggest A More Appropriate Title: ""Us vs. Them""","I have trouble believing that this author actually writes for the NY Times...and no, Ms. Williams, not because you're black but rather because of the very inflammatory nature of your book! Most articles I read in the Times are thoughtful and decidely lacking in the ""Us vs. Them"" voice that is apparent in reading your work. I wonder how anyone who is not black could read the book and not come away feeling as if the target audience was ""Blacks Only."" There are several instances where the reader is warned to the effect that ""Oh, well, there goes the white man again"". I have trouble beleiving this book will do what its stated intention is: to alert the races to each others inherent prejudices. Actually, it probably does do that, but unfortunately it does it in such a way as to reinforce the ""Us vs. Them"" mentality that Ms. Williams apparently lives by."
1,Not so great,"While this book tries hard to explain and dispell those divisive ""little things,"" overall I found that it perpetuates certain stereotypes even more. I found it offensive. If you want to make a difference and bridge that gap, don't read this book... start talking to folks who are different than you, and get the courage to ask some candid questions. You'll might just learn something."
1,Enough already!!,"Sheesh, just when you think things might start getting better between the races someone has to write some drivel like this. Why bother with scientific evidence gathering and statistical correlations - just go ahead an use a few inflammatory anecdotes that may or may not be true much less relevant. Avoid this book and read just about anything by Shelby Steele or Thomas Sowell instead."
1,This is Just Bad,"I bought this book about a year ago and have yet to finish it to this day. I'm not an offended White person, I am an African American male who deals with issues of race everyday. I really wanted to like this book but it is just plain horrible. I can't believe that she writes for a newspaper. Her ideas are scattered and she doesn't really back up any of her claims. Some of the things in this book are true but they were just placed in the wrong chapter and just rambled off. She reminded me of a bad comedian who just jumps from subject to subject without ever finishing a joke."
5,A useful aid to cross-cultural understanding,"After reading this book, I feel as though a close friend has filled me in on some of the details surrounding life in this country as an African American. It can be difficult to broach these sensitive issues with acquaintances, so it is extremely helpful to have somebody who lives in the culture help describe and explain the differences.African Americans usually have to learn the white culture thoroughly in order to succeed, but we members of the white culture rarely have the necessity nor the opportunity to learn what it is like to grow up black. I applaud and thank Ms. Williams and Ms. Hunter-Gault for providing us with one such opportunity."
1,Well -- At least she tried again.,"I'm just shocked she got another chance at the same subject matter twice.How about we stop pushing the stereotype that all ""blacks"" think this way, and all ""whites"" act that way and move on already. The notion that ""race"" is the defining issue is nonsense. Culturally the person raised in a different environment than me is bound to get under my skin now and then as I try to understand where they are coming from. No need for a book to tell me that."
1,Racist Ramblings,"I only got this book because it was required for my counseling class. This is literally the worst book I've ever read. IT's about a black woman talking about her ""life experiences"" (and I use the term loosely since I think she made most of these up) to show how ""racist"" white people are. She makes generalizations such as white people aren't cool but talks about how bad it is for whites to make generalizations. She has no research, no statistics, and no proof of her claims. The only reason this book won anything from the New York Times is because it's a black author writing about racism and the NYT was too afraid to say it sucked."
2,Excellent look at Ms. Williams' psyche,"She's angry and she's one of those people who will stay angry, regardless. The pettiness is really astounding. Given that there is serious work to do on race relations in this country it is simply folly to listen to someone who is so blinded by insecurity and anger that objectivity is impossible."
1,She should have stayed in the sports section.,"I felt like my intelligence got deteriorated after reading this book. It was a complete waste of time. The more I read, the more disgusted I got. She certainly has a few good points. But most of the things that she mentions in the book are so...dumb and prejudiced. For example, she says ""we"" the blacks know how to throw a real party and ""they"" the whites don't. Also, she implies that black men go out with white women because it gets under the skin of white men and want to show that ""once you try black, you won't go back."" (Pp. 280) These are only a couple of things that Lena the know-it-all Williams says in the book. I'm so disgusted with myself that I spent my own money on this ridiculous book!!!"
4,On the other hand...,"I was sort of shocked to read all the negative reviews of this book. I read it recently and really liked it.No, her defense of white people is not especially strident or lengthy. Why would it be? As a white woman reading the book, the information about african-american culture was the more interesting to me anyway. I already know that lots of white people don't like, for example, that if someone accuses you of racism and is proved wrong you never get an apology. I didn't know anything about white women's hair being an issue.The information mostly is anecdotal, but conversations seem to be the best way to get it. I can't imagine that any sort of survey would get honest answers.Anyhow, I learned a lot. I'm tempted to write her a note and say that I would be happy to participate in a focus group for a followup book."
3,It's the little things,I did enjoy the book and what she had to say about the way blacks and whites act when they are around eachother. This book may me understand a little bit better on race and what is was like for the people that had to grow up around that. I really think this book is pretty good and i wounld tell a friend that they should read the book.
4,Should Spark a Discussion,"While I agree that the perspective was largely that of a black woman (we don't learn a lot about what gets under the skin of whites), this provided me with a different point of view. If nothing else, it's worthwhile to be reminded that things you don't even think about may be really annoying--if not hurtful--to someone else. And it can't possibly hurt to try and be a little more aware of the feelings of others.Nonetheless, I think this book provides a good jumping-off point for dicussions about race. Many people are remarkably ignorant about how thoroughly racism pervades American society (other societies, too, of course, but that's not what this book is about). Williams provides a number of examples that nearly everyone should recognize, whether or not you agree with her."
3,Largely anecdotal,"I did find out more about racial perceptions that are very rarely discussed. I thought there would be more rigorous research, but it is mainly a series of interracial (and interesting) conversations interlaced with the author's personal experiences, which are eye-opening."
3,Interesting but less enlightening than I hoped,"The book starts off quite strong and has several gems that explain the possible rationale behind behaviors that I've observed for years among Blacks. As a Black female, it also often made me smile because the descriptions were so familiar to my life experience. However I was disappointed in the lack of balance between the Black and White perspective, and by the middle of the book I also began to feel that Ms. Williams either has a major chip on her shoulder and/or the White folks she interviewed just didn't have much to say. I felt that I learned little or nothing about the White perspective on Black/White interactions. However the book is full of good conversation starters and therefore definately worth reading."
1,"better titled""500 Complaints about Whites""","I am very sorry to say that the subtitle of this book is highly misleading and after, perhaps after 2 complaints by whites about blacks we are bombarded by a myriad of slights on blacks by whites. Page after page, chapter after chapter Ms Williams pontificates on how her people are poorly treated by the white folk. All this may be true, but I certainly wouldnt have paid$22.00 less 10% to read this one sided, even if true,continuum of how poor the race relations are, without a further note about how whites really feel. I pride myself on being unbiased, but this is a very one sided, mean spirited review of white people. Thumbs Down."
2,Bought with High Hopes; But Highly Disappointed,"I purchased this book with much anticipation about getting a broad, balanced, objective view of every-day black/white relations as the cover promises. What I, unfortunately, got was a narrow, author-oriented nearly-all-black view of real and, quite often, ""perceived"" insults by whites against blacks. It furthers the advancement of relativistic ""political correctness"" that makes perceived wrongs as bad, if not worse, than real ones and puts us all on edge and hinders open and honest discussion. Ms. Williams overlooks and/or excuses bad behavior by blacks and applys her experiences in a lower middle class, hard-working black environment and extrapolates that all blacks are like those in her family or inner circle. Ms. Williams squanders a great opportunity to balance the scales."
3,Life is a one act play,"Take a trip with Miguel. Visit the bars of the Lower East Side. Visit the junkies, pimps, prostitutes, and the wannabees. Come on, take this trip and see the world of New York as Miguel saw it. Sit back and watch the dramas of everyday life of the weary unfold. Feel what it's like your first day out of prison. See the tough meet someone tougher. Don't pack any bags. Come as you are. Anything you might need will be provided to you, free of charge. Don't be surprised if you want to leave quickly, or stay longer than you intended. Miguel, the junkie christ, has a habit of doing that to people."
2,No wrapping. Supposedly new,"I received this cap without any protective wrapping. Cap looks used, old and got dirty."
5,good,It really depends on what kind of music you like. If you are a Buffy fan you might be familier with there song strong the version on this cd was even better I thought then the original version. I thought this was a great cd.
4,can't get enough of VC...,"Velvet Chain is....amazing. from Erika's voice to Jeff's muscianship...there is no one like them. I want to move to Los Angeles just to hear them live. Wow. ""Treason"" is amazing Erika's voice reaches out and wraps you in pure velvet. A cd you can't afford to not have."
2,Buzz and woody cars,buzz car broke upon opening product- the top head helmut came off. My kids were very disappointed.
4,Makes a great gift!,"The Pixar Cars Movie Moments (whoever the character might be) are the cutest toys on earth! I bought one for myself (to put in our TV room) and got them as well for my nephews! They totally love it! They've collected almost all of the characters in the CARS movie and this is definitely a great addition to their collection and playtime! :)Downside is that the 'helmet' of Buzz Lightyear can easily be removed, thus, I'm sure it's a piece which kids will easily lose."
4,"Great toy, but Buzz's helmet is annoying","My son loves the die-cast Cars toys. He has many of them and plays with them constantly, and the quality of most of them has been pretty good. This 2 pack, however, is an exception. The helmet on the Buzz toy falls off easily. It's more than just ""detachable""--it falls off every time you lift the toy up. When we first opened these toys up I thought Buzz was defective, and I returned the toy, got a new set, and found the exact same problem. I guess this is how the toy is SUPPOSED to function, though that's hard for me to believe.We found a simple solution. The helmet is superglued now, but it still annoys me that Mattel would make a toy like this with a helmet that just, well, falls off. Still, these toys are a lot of fun and are a pretty good value if you buy them at a retail store and not at inflated third party prices (due to scarcity)."
5,Great toys,"As noted the Buzz helmet does not stay on. I super glued my son's and he is 110% happy with these toys. I am happy with the metal feel and the paint jobs are outstanding. I posted images of there size, they are smaller then the Die Cast Cars Movie toys as I assumed (in the movie Cars at the end these ""appear"" smaller). I recommend this to anyone with a kid that likes Cars and Toy Story. My son is going NUTS over these."
4,A course in Balkan History,"This is a very informative book on the history of the Balkan countries, including Greece, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, Rumania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Albania. The book reads like a college course in History: I even took notes on it so that I could remain organized. If you are looking for a book that reads easily, and will be informative as well as fun, this is probably not the book for you. However, if your goal is to learn about this diverse and troubled region of the world, and you have the patience and thirst for knowledge of a scholar, this would be right up your alley."
3,....don't let the magic die......,"I was always so ""hyped"" when I heard this on the radio...a real treat. The song, however, is one of the rare ones that actually ""wears thin"" when you have access to it at anytime."
5,THIS IS THE COOLEST STUFF EVER!!!,THIS IS WHAT DANCE/TECHNO MUSIC SOUNDED LIKE BEFORE IT HAD A NAME. THERE ISN'T MUCH TO SAY BESIDES IT'S REALLY REALLY COOL. THERE'S ALSO A REMIX VERSION OF MARRS NEEDS WOMEN.
3,Great early Techno/dance.,"This is not ""Texe Marrs"". It is MARRS. It is good early Techno/Dance, but not the epitome. Check out Pop Will Eat Itself."
4,what a blast!,this is one that stays in your head 4 good reasons - i'd advise anybody who likes music 2 listen...
5,Reva Dalby,"First of all, I really liked reading Reva since I loved how she acted snobby. Also, this book was a suspense. It kept me on the edge. It had me thinking who was the murderer. Actually, I was surprised when I found out the murderer."
5,Tis' the season to die,I really liked Silent Night 3. This was the best Fear Street Super Chiller book to me. I loved the characters. This book was full of surprises. It really shocked me when the murderer was revealed.
1,How many times can you be almost killed?,"I have read Silent Night and Silent Night 2. Those were good. But in this book, I think poor Reva is having a little bad luck. Her fashion show gets spoiled by this guy murdering almost all of her models (two to be exact) and she almost gets murdered too. Okay, in the first one she almost gets shot. In the second book she gets kidnapped and almost killed. Come on R.L. Stine, you should have stopped at Silent Night 2!!!"
5,3rd Part,"In th final book of Silent Night, Reva Dalby heads a fashion show with scarves made by Pam and her friend Willow. But a model dies before the show can start."
5,wonderful dog food,"I have an 11 months old Westie who has skin allergies. Since I have change to the Wellness brand, his scratching has decrease and his skin and coat looks great! And he loves the taste!"
2,Sad,"I had hoped to listen to the traditional Kenton sound. I was disappointed. What he put together on this disc was an inferior Kenton sound. Nothing lasts forever, and his ""new"" orchestra clearly shows that the old Kenton sound is gone forever. Sad, but another sign that what was...no longer is. The message I received was to advise Kenton lovers to simply listen to his old recordings, or reflect on what you remember as the Kenton sound. Time does march on."
4,very entertaining,Last year my three year old received this for his second birthday and he is still playing with it over a year later. Which is more than I can say for all the other more exspensive toys he also received.We still have all the pieces because I keep a gallon size ziplock bag to put the pieces in inside the farmhouse. It is very cute and portable enough to take to grandmas house and on vacations. This toy is a great variation on a classic toy that will never go out of style.
5,Lot's of fun,"My son is almost 3 and just loves this and has owned it for over a year and still carries it out and sits on the floor and plays with it, and he has never had any problem getting the pieces to stay together."
3,Potato Head Farm,I agree with the reviewer who said that this toy squelched creativity and was hard for little hands to manipulate. The pieces fall out of the potato heads once inserted.
3,Dissapointing implementation of a good idea,"My kids always liked Mr. Potato Head, so when I saw the farm toy come out I bought it for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. My first surprise was that unlike the silly suitcase, the pieces were not separate (nose, eyes and ears are all part of one peice, hands are holding things, etc). This cuts down on your child's creative options. The parts are also smaller than on the traditonal set, so they aren't interchangable with the Silly Suitcase. (surprising, because the pegs are only slightly smaller, Hasbro could have easily kept the pegs the same size). We were hoping to mix and match but weren't able to.The most dissapointing thing about this toy is how hard it is to fit the pieces into the potato. They don't really fit in all the way, so they fall out. When you do get them in, they're hard to pull out.All in all, a good idea not well thought out."
1,Don't waste your money,"I know all magazines have lots of ads, but Portland Monthly takes it to a whole new level. At least 75% of the magazine is ads, probably more. The remaining pages are usually uninteresting and poorly written. Once in a great while they will have something moderately interesting, but I can spend 5 minutes on the internet and find more interesting content. Needless to say, I won't be renewing my subscription. I wouldn't even read the magazine if they sent it to me for free."
1,Where is it?,"I love this periodical and I have bought many from the store shelves, I ordered this two months ago and have not received a copy yet?"
2,IT HAD NO DEPTH,Did Danielle Steel try to write a history book? There was so much junk on the war I couln't quite grasp it. I had no way to fathom Nick and Liane's affair because there was nothing leading up to it. They're best of friends and then out of the blue they sleep together. If I hadn't read the book jacket I'd never know that Nick and Liane had deep feelings for each other. Try again Mrs. Steel.
4,Good story but Ms. Steel needs to tone down the VULGARITY!,"This is the only Danielle Steel book that I have read that ever made me cry. It was a good story. True, her characterizations lack depth and are kind of hollow.....but reading Steel is a guilty pleasure.If you are offended by bad language...please do NOT read Ms. Steel. I find myself ""whiting out"" the vulgarity in her books. There is no need for it. Bad language adds nothing to the story and makes the characters less likeable. She can write a good story without being trashy and filthy."
3,A Nice Story,"A novel set during WW2 not as good as some of DS's other books based on the world wars, found it dragged on just a little.It was an easy read though having said that and I enjoyed reading it."
2,Not going to finish,"I found an old hardback copy of this book that was left in my house by the previous owners. I am about 100 pages into it, but after reading the reviews, I will not finish it. I love DS's books, but this seems like it is going to be too sad for me to continue. I like Liane with her husband, and I don't want her to fall in love with Nick! Since reviews have mentioned that it will end in that way, I will have to find something else to read!"
2,Too sad for me,"I was hoping this might be a romance novel, but it is not. It is a story of two people who fall in love but cannot be together because of other marriages and children. Even though it has a happy ending, I was depressed most of the time while reading the book. The characters are wonderful and interesting, but the plot is too sad for me. My bias is for the funny, uplifting, happy and/or sensual romance novel. This was the first Danielle Steel book I have read, and since it did not fit my bias, I probably won't read her other books."
5,Another great story,"I don't know what else to say, except this is a great love story.It's a journey when you read DS, I've read all of her books, and they are all wonderful. If you read her, be prepared to read all 50 of her books though, you'll be hooked."
1,Poor Quality,"Book smelled of mildew like it had been wet or in a basement , had no jacket, all around poor quality"
3,"Easy to install, but hard to use it","I bought mine expecting to do nice spiral forms, but It requires practice and some time. Stil I don't get what the pictures shows in the ad. Maybe more practice is needed.Su uso es simple y el personal aprende rapido a trabajar con el, pero las papas grandes se traban y se trabaja mejor con papas medianas."
2,Use Small Peppercorn or salt,"I purchased both the fine and coarse grind versions of the Kyocera Ceramic Mill. At the local grocer, picked up a small jar of peppercorn and put half into each of the two grinders. As I am used to fine ground pepper, I tried that grinder first and had excellent results. Sadly, the coarse mill seemed to have trouble ingesting the pepper - I took the lid off (the grinding part), put in a few peppercorns and gave it several turns. The peppercorns just rolled around as they were too big to fall into the teeth of the grinder. Turns out I much prefer the flavor of coarse ground pepper and have begun a search to find a more suitable grinder for any size of peppercorn.Edited to add: I've been using this grinder for salt and have found that it works very well as a salt mill - four stars as a salt grinder."
4,Beautiful,"Jejune bring an awesome mix of soaring harmonies with the guy-girl vocal mix. Not your typical ""emo"" band, jejune uses delay effects and hollow echoes and reverb to make a unique guitar and vocal sound. Definitely something different if you are getting tired of all the Mineral/SDRE soundalikes."
3,An ignored gem from the 90's,"Jejune was a small blip on the radar during the 90's, likely a consequence of a small recording label and an unfortunate (and innacurate) ""emo"" label at a time when the genre was at the height of its repellance. While occasionally teetering the fine line between epic and heavy-handed emotion, Jejune are rare masters of male/female vocal interplay, and this interaction is one of the brilliant components of the sound. Had this album's lofty ambition been realized with a more refined recording and stronger label backing, it would have rivaled the great works of other, more successful artists of their ilk (My Bloody Valentine, et al)."
4,unique sound,"Jejune is a great mix of beautiful harmony, and interesting lyrics. Their sound is unlike any other I have heard. This is what emo is all about!"
5,2250 a.d.,Have not had time to read the book yet. It was an Andre Norton book that I read as a teenager and it must have left a good feeling about it because I had to have it to read again
2,A mixed review,"Eichstadt and Small's study of the ways in which Southern Plantation museums do and do not address slavery is primarily useful in that it confirms what most of us already recognized. Most Southern plantation museums do not confront the issue of slavery in a useful or balanced way. This is not news to public historians. Although the book does serve to document the lack of slavery representation in most southern house museums, as a whole, it is not particularly profound. Some of Eichstadt and Small's conclusions and terminology, however, do provide useful tools for public historians studying the representation of slavery in house museums. The introductory sections are thought provoking as they address some of the reasons that the issue of slavery is often absent in the interpretive framework of many southern house museums."
2,Unbelievable,"Although I see the validity of their points throughout the book, I walked away from it feeling bad to be a white person. Yes, slavery happened, yes, it was a horrible atrocity, but I don't think that they do an adaquate job of truly examining museums but instead reducing it to a white vs. black dichotomy. If you want to read something truly interesting and non white bashing, go elsewhere."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Road to Camlann is the story of the betrayal and conflict that brought about the end of King Arthur.With the affair between Guenevere and Lancelot discovered, theconflict and jealousy between Gawain and Lancelot intensifies. Thisgives Modred something to work with, in bringing about the beginning ofthe end.Perhaps not quite as good as the first two books in this trilogy."
1,Just plain noise,"I am an ardent Paul Hardcastle fan. I own every PH and Jazzmasters CD. This is his earliest work. It is a homage to his anti-war sentiments and cold war ethos. To put not too fine a point on the matter, it is simply awful except for one or two cuts. Thank God he grew up to be a big boy and learned to address himself to his genuine talent as a composer and musician."
2,Doug's Farewell to the Silver Screen,"Though appropriately cast in the title role, ""The Private Life of Don Juan"" (1934) proved a less-than-spectacular swansong for Douglas Fairbanks. Director Alexander Korda's attempt to duplicate the success of ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" was a doomed enterprise. To make matters worse, the aging Fairbanks had little enthusiasm for his sound films, with the exception of the light-hearted ""Mr. Robinson Crusoe"" (1932). Despite Korda's fine production values, one wishes that Fairbanks had not made this flat and depressing ""romantic satire."""
3,"Nice lotion, but no coconut scent","I purchased this lotion because I'm on the never-ending hunt to find a natural lotion that smells like coconuts. I don't understand why this is such a difficult task! I had high hopes that Shikai nailed it, but no. It smells nothing like coconut. Not even a hint of coconut! My daughter said it, ""smelled like flowers."" It's actually more of a powdery-vanilla scent. The lotion is actually really nice - not too light, but not too greasy."
2,"No Coconut in the ""coconut lotion?""",I was looking forward to finally finding a product that truely smelled like coconuts...but this was a huge dissapointment...it isnt even listed on the ingredients!!
3,"Decent substitue for a live show, but I'd spend the cash...","on his CD's.This particular show is very ""PC"" oriented (20-30 minutes on the soapbox of anti-racisim/anti-gay topics). If you can't stand it when he gets on one of those rants, stay away from this one.It also has the short version of the ""Eric the Pilot"" story. If you haven't heard this one, go to 21361.com and order the cd. The CD version of the story is significantly better. I'd rate it as one of his best CD's."
4,Good but a bit watered down,"This is cool to listen too, Rollins is really cool, but his topic matter seems fairly tame, and a bit too restrained. If you want to get a picture of who he is, try Talking from the Box first and then take a look at this after."
3,Worthwhile but restrained. Catch him live!,"This video offers some of his best material so far! In particular a short version of ""Eric the Pilot"". [Buy a longer version on CD as well as ""Think Tank"" for his best spoken word work on CD to date] Having seen Rollins live 3 times I have 2 complaints with this video. a] His performance is restrained and watered down compared to the real thing. and b] Video, while showing his body language which is so much a part of his live shows, cannot capture his powerful stage presence. Still this video stands on its own as entertaining and worthwhile. If you had to buy one recording of his spoken word this would be it. But catch him live if you can!"
4,Try them in audio,"I tried the second of these wonderful stories in audio and was very pleased with the result. Her voice was well done and most of the others. You'll find yourself popping those discs in and out at a rapid rate. Mrs. P is the closest to Miss Marple I've ever come across, and have thought what an interesting video series it would make. It's fun that she's an interesting American lady. Anytime you tackle a wild idea of a senior sleuth turned international adventuress, it will have an improbable or two, but who cares? This is a lively and fast moving tale well told."
5,Best of the Pollifax Series,"Mrs. Pollifax, a grandmother, garden club member, and part time secret CIA agent starts out on her second mission. The mission is simple: take a passport to Turkey and give it to a defecting Soviet agent so she can get to the U.S. But once the plot begins, hold on to your seat. The action is fast and non-stop. Mrs Pollifax is befriended by a string of colorful characters, including Colon, a young British expatriate who comes along for the ride, Sandor, the vagrant they meet in a graveyard, a beautiful, young Turkish girl who is a member of the non-violence movement, and later a roaming band of gypsies. Mrs Pollifax is accosted by the menacing villains multiple times along the way, but with the help of her new friends, her instincts, and her positive personality she manages to make anything fun. Mrs Pollifax is absolutely lovable."
3,Not an exact fit,Everything fits as it should except that the Flange on the exit tube is off just enough to cause the cover clamp not to fit back on properly. Had to wire tie it in place to keep the fuel line retained properly. If I had purchased it locally I would have returned it for one that fit with the cover clamp correctly.
5,War is hell for everyone involved,"My mom was born in Southern Germany just before the war started. Her and her family went through years of existing on barely any food, never enough blankets and clothes to keep warm in those bitter cold winters. She still remembers the bombs falling near her home and to this day has nightmares about it. ""Birth of a Tumbleweed"" gives a glimpse into the world of a family who was just trying to survive. Somehow after the war, all Germans were blamed for the sick ideas of Hitler. Inge's generation had to grow up with a heavy load of guilt on their shoulders, guilt thrown upon them not just by the Allied, but by the German government itself.Inge's book took a lot of courage to write, since esp. her generation was expected to just shut up and take the blame. I understand why she moved away. Reading Inge's book also gave me a better understanding of what my mom went through."
1,Story poorly told ...,"Oh my gosh it's hard for me to give this author's personal story only one star, but I entirely agree with Mr. Cappetto's earlier review calling the book a pathetic whine, a therapy session (and a bad one at that) ....The author had a story to tell, probably a very interesting one, and I wish she had told it... had used the services of an editor.It was my belief when I bought this book several years ago that it was a true story. I don't buy books of fiction except on very rare occasion. So, on one page there is the bold announcement that this is a book of fiction. Next page says it's a memoir. And it went downhill from there. It's not impossible that events she described may be true---but I'm inclined to believe it's a book of fiction by a chronically self-pitying person who, also, is not a very accomplished author. Don't buy the book."
5,a life savour in the deepest distress,"an album which has helped me through the darkest nightsi could write on all night about this amazing production something or otherbut 2 comments((title track)) amazing rap((weeping)) my dearest friend and protector when the hell hounds rage and attempt to destroy my soul""i am not weaping now by and by i will bid farewell to Babylonian world bye and bye........""zion = lion"
2,men in blue,"I was expecting to read one of the many great books written by Griffin, but this is just and average book. After reading his Presidential series, I was expecting to find a new hero to relate to, but I guess he decided to write each book with new hero's. Not my cup of tea"
4,WEB Griffin always a great read,"This is the first WEB Griffin book that I have read that was not based on the military, so I was a little skeptical to start, but as in all my previous reads I enjoyed the heck out of it. His characters are all identifiable in fact I have met them all at some time in my not so short Life. As an ex government employee he is the best at describing the rivalries for power and the jealousy that goes with bureaucratic upheaval. The real trick is he does this with out boring us to death. All in all a great read."
2,Not enough,"I enjoyed his marine corps books, but after reading 3 of his men in blue books, i'm finished with WEB. Not enough action or interesting dialogue, I had to skip several pages to get to any action. Not much happens to the characters, you'll read about them hanging out at a bar but he doesn't develop the characters like he did with The Corps."
3,30 Years Out Of Date!,"Of course, Mr. Butterworth wrote these books before his very popular ""Brotherhood of War"" and ""The Corps"" series were published...but still, as a cop for over 20 years, it was hard to relate to such outdated procedures and attitudes. Once I got past that, I did enjoy seeing how his characters set the stage for their doppelgangers in Brotherhood of War...Peter Wohl=Craig Lowell, and Matt Payne = Geoff Craig, etc. If you are looking for excellent, accurate police procedurals, read the Harry Bosch novels by Michael Connelly, or anything by T. Jefferson Parker. Those two really get it right."
5,Protects corner well,"This fender bumper corner protector works well. It was easy to install with SS screws and made it easier to park boats on the side of the dock without worry of hitting the corner. I have an aluminum dock and it is unforgiving, it does not give."
4,Excellent garage music,"Very sad songs, but excellent CD. Great for fans of female vocals with catchy guitar melodies. A great CD for those rainy days."
1,Not a dream come true,I was so disappointed in this book. Entirely over priced for what the book involves. I would not recommend this book to a true fan because it will only let you down.
1,nothing special,"I have thick porous hair. This product is not for me. I didnt notice any noteworthy shine, my hair didnt feel soft after using this conditioner either. I will not be using again. I cant speak for how it will work for people who have fine and thinner hair but it sure didnt work for my thick and porous mane! Will not order again. Waste of my money."
2,Very tight and battery has issues.,It will hurt your head if you put on long.The Battery is not lasting long and COULD NOT able to find an extra one.
3,complex w/ poor reliability but useful,"in brief:+: Bluetooth and therefore no wires nor need for line of sight+: included bluetooth adapter allows to use it w/ any device w/ a headphone jack-: Uncomfortable when wearing it for a longer period-: was expensive when I bought it ($85)-: 1 battery died right away (Have not called manufacturer to replace and now out of warranty)-: it takes a PHD to get it set up. Once you understand the basics it's relatively easy to useI bought this back in mid 2007 and after trying to use it and running into battery issues, I gave up. I never bothered to call the manufacturer and have it replaced.Recently, I got a new TV to replace my old Sony Wega that came w/ a wireless headset and was in need of a headset. Re-discovered this unit. Since one battery is dead, I have to keep the adapter plugged into a USB port but can then attach it to the headphone jack of the TV and use the headset to watch TV w/o making noise."
2,Wireless Headphone Set,"Ok! but it lost signal while I move/walk, even rotate my head to certain position~"
5,Best bluetooth headphones ever,"I bought these when they first came out in July 2006 (as X5; not X5i). Four years later they are still working perfectly. Amazing battery life, comfortable fit, great sound, very portable, and lots of ways it can be used.I do not know what the negative reviews are talking about - my friends at work liked it so much that they each bought one (four of us).highly recommended, and like another reviewer said - best product for the gym - like him, I have been using these pretty much 4-5 times in a gym under sweaty conditions, running, weights, etc - never let me down. Battery lasts for ever."
1,Stay Away,When I first got these headphones back in October they had a great battery life but that was about it. The sound had a poor range. The microphone fell apart within 2 months and the battery died just after 6 months. Replacement batteries are hard to find and almost the same cost as an entire new unit.
3,Headphones from Beach Camera,"I cannot tell you much about the headphones, except that they fit well and looked good. Although I tried both the AC and DC chargers, and USB charging, the battery on the headphones never charged up enough to turn on to even test them. Beach Camera, who sold them to me, was willing to refund my money. They were not, however, willing to replace or exchange them. So I had to return them, wait almost 3 weeks for my refund to happen, and then order new headphones and wait for them to arrive. I call that ADEQUATE Customer Service. But it is a long way from good or excellent customer service. So deal with Beach Camera if you have to, but go elsewhere if you can."
5,best solution yet,"i hesitated on purchasing this bone for awhile; it is pretty pricey in comparison to normal bones and i didnt know if it would be worth the additional cost, or if it would just be a let down like every other dog toy I've purchased.i eventually decided that i was throwing enough money away every week on buying multiple toys and/or bones that my dog would destroy in a matter of minutes.so i got this one and all that changed. my dog (he is an American Bulldog/Chocolate Lab mix and an aggressive chewer) loves this bone and has been working on it off and on for weeks. the Galileo is only slightly beat up now, and it is still in one, solid piece. it has a long life ahead of it too. :)"
3,Ok Dog Bone,The dogs chew on this if no other bones are available. Its much larger than I expected and very heavy and awkward for a medium size dog to play with.
5,Best product for the money!,"My dog, a Vizlador (Labrador/Vizsla) won't give it up!! I have to take it away from him so he can sleep!! It is very sturdy and will last a long time even with his strong chew drive. Get one and keep your dog busy for hours! No more chewing on my shoes...."
3,Decent chew but does not beat antlers,"We have two year old pit bull mixes and a 5 month old APBT. They seek and destroy all squeaky and stuffing toys within a matter of minutes, so we tried different nylabones. We try to rotate their toys to prevent boredom, but one of our dogs loves to hide the bones before we can snatch them away. The odd shaped bone lasts longer than the traditional bones, but they lose interest a lot quicker too. We stick to the big nylabones and antlers now."
2,Dog loved it - until her tooth cracked...,"Our dog loved chewing on this bone...she is a very aggressive chewer and this was one of the few toys that held up. Unfortunately, it might be a little too strong. She cracked one of her molars (completely in half!) while chewing on this toy which resulted in several hundred dollars in dental surgery..."
3,Dogs did not like it,"My dogs did not show any interest in this. I even put peanut butter on it! They love their other Nylabone Bones, but did not care for the shape of this one. The only thing I could think of was that it was to large for them; 20 lb mini-Aussies. One of my dogs is a hard chewer; likes to chew amsot anything. I will stick with the regular bones."
1,awful,"My dog loved this bone, but within 1 week he had 3 broken teeth. This items not worth the hundreds it will cost in vet bills."
2,dog chew toy,"Dog's do not care for this toy, to heavy and edges are very sharp once the dog does chew on it. Waste of money."
4,Excellent bones,Bought these as Christmas presents for the dogs. They love them and so far they are showing pretty good resistance to constant chewing. Should last for a good while.
4,Great But...,"Best dog chew bone(s) ever made. They have been our bone of choice for many years. ALL of my dogs absolutely love to chew them, however, I do worry about the small sharp, jagged pieces of nylon that protrude from the chewed surface so, I pick the bones up after they have been chewed for about an hour. That system works well. As with most routines, the boys have learned that they will get to chew again tomorrow. Yes, it is possible to take a bone away from a Pit Bull, a Labrador and a Shepherd. Just make sure that the dog understands that the bone belongs to you before you lend it to him. If you cannot pick up your dogs food bowl while he is eating, I would not try to pick up his bone while he is chewing! My vet's only concern was about my Pit's teeth after the 11 year old chipped a tooth while chewing. His chew sessions were reduced but he enjoyed the bones without incident until he died at 14."
2,Very Durable,"This Nylabone Galileo was sure to be the answer for my bulldog. It did last longer than previous purchases, but the ends that he chewed are very sharp and prickly. It's heavy and he still carries it around sometimes, but I'm sure it hurts his mouth and gums if he chews it."
2,"Great idea, but wasn't a great option for our dog","I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer (lab/shepherd mix) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy. Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes, and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15. This was not a good fit for our dog, and I'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog. You just never know. We still buy the Big Chews religiously."
5,Strong,"This truly is a super strong bone. Our pointer mix loves to chew, but far from mega chewer. This satisfies here and it only flakes off in very very tiny flakes that easily pass through our dog. Awesome product."
2,Uninterested,My dog didn't seem to care for this product at all. He also had quite a bit of trouble trying to carry it in his mouth. Definitely not one of his favorite Nylabones.
1,My Dog Needed Surgery,"THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DESERVE ANY STARS. We gave my dog (a 48lb Border Collie Miix) one of the beef flavored bones in hopes that he would enjoy this as much as he enjoys rawhides. However, I left him with this for a half an hour, and when I got back, he had chewed it to bits and eaten some of it. And this was for STRONG chewers. Two days later, he woke up throwing up 6 times. We took him to the emergency vet, and after multiple X-rays, and a barium swallow, he ended up having to undergo surgery to have the piece removed. And this is NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED! Do more research into this product before buying it. I wish I had."
3,An Anecdote...,"I'm not sure if it's a defect in the product or my dog, who is nicknamed ""Shredder"". It took my dog 3 days to completely mar this bone, and another month to disfigure it enough that you can't tell it's a bone anymore. On the plus side, this is the longest lasting chew toy I have ever bought for her, and she hasn't chewed all the way THROUGH it yet. A good product, just not EXACTLY as tough as it's marketed to be."
5,My Dog's Favorite Bone,"The Galileo Nylabone is my dog's favorite. My Corgi is a ""power"" chewer and this is his favorite shape bone. I like it because it keeps him occupied and it stands up well to his chewing. Great product!"
2,Not for all dogs,"I haven't had any luck with my puppies chewing on these. I have heard that some dogs love them and others don't. I wouldn't buy them again, just because our puppies don't use them."
1,Do not recommend this product,"I purchased this product for my new 1-year old Lab puppy, a real chewer. My veterinarian advised me that they repeatedly see dogs with broken teeth from Nylabone products, because they are too hard for canine tooth enamel."
1,I got a USED bone when I ordered this!,"I know these Nylabone Galileo Bones are a great product. Unfortunately Amazon sent me an opened and slightly used product when I ordered this. I do not see anything about being used in this description. The bone is scraped up and the packaging was opened and missing the cardboard (clear plastic packaging, different than in the picture.)"
5,PERFECT TOY!,"IF YOU HAVE A DOG(S) THAT ARE STRONG CHEWERS YOU WILL LIKE THIS TOY. MY DOG CANNOT DESTROY THIS AND BELIEVE ME, HE HAS DESTROYED ALMOST EVERY TOY THAT HE OWNS. HE EVEN SEEMS TO LIKE IT. HE DOESN'T LOVE IT, BUT HE DOES SEEM TO LIKE IT! FOR HIM, THAT'S SAYING A LOT!!!"
3,This dog didn't care for it.,I have bought many of these in the past. My older/larger dog loved them. My current dog doesn't care for it. Oh well.
5,What a Dog Bone,My pitbull LOVES these Nylabones. She goes through the smaller ones in a matter of days; but this one is large enough to keep her busy for months. I highly recommend
1,Dog loved it...a bit too much,"I bought this for my 5 year old 20 lb Jack Russell Terrier. She is an extremely aggressive chewer and most toys don't last 5 minutes. I thought this would be the perfect solution.I gave it to her a few hours a day supervised, and she loved it. About a week later I noticed blood all over the floor. Her whole mouth was cut up from the ""rice size"" pieces that clean the teeth. Despite her mouth being massacred, she still chewed on the toy. I had to throw it away so she wouldnt hurt herself. I touched it as well and it was SHARP.What a waste of money. I still cant find any toys for my dog to chew without her ripping them up or hurting herself..... sigh.."
2,too hard,Reviews I had read raved this bone for aggressive chewers. My american bulldog is definitely an aggressive chewer. He will not touch this bone because of how hard it is. He loves to chew but has to have a bone with bendablility . Yes he ends up shredding them but this bone he won't go near. Very disappointed for what I spent on it.
1,Awful Product,"My dog loved this bone, but within 1 week he had 3 broken teeth. This items not worth the hundreds it will cost in vet bills."
5,"great, long lasting, durable bones","This is the best bone/best toy investment I have made for my dogs. I have an 11 month old airedale mix puppy and my boyfriend's dog, a chocolate lab/ german shorthaired pointer mix that is almost four and they are constant chewers- they love and destroy almost every other bone, but these are awesome. After my puppy went though some of the other nylabones, I decided to spend the money and get the galileo- it was completely worth it. She has had one bone four about five months and its not completely dead yet- I bought another one and the largest size for my other dog- they love them. These are not light chewers. The larger dog can make mince meat of a frozen beef rib bone in under five minutes, and my puppy has only been beaten by this bone, and one of the other 'souper' nylabone chews. They carry around and chew on them for at least a half hour every day, and these bones can take it! Definitely keeps their teeth clean and their breath fresh."
3,It's too big,"I'm torn what to rate this product. The quality is great - big, very thick, very heavy - but it's so big my dogs won't chew on it. My dogs are 80 and 60 lbs and love to chew. I would prefer my money back since this wasn't a cheap bone than to have a nice big bone laying around that no one chews."
5,Nylabone is the best!,"I have a half Australian shepherd/half Labrador dog who has torn through every toy we give him within hours. I was scrambling for ideas when the guy at the local pet store told me about nylabones! At the time, I just bought the little Galileo, to see how my pup would do with it. Three months later at Christmas he still hadn't destroyed it! So we got the big Galileo and the Big Chew for him. 11 months later he still has all three and I think we will be adding a new toy to our collection this Christmas. Thanks Nylabone for making this great product!!"
5,Great for Powerful Chewers,"I have three large mixed breed dogs who are extremely powerful chewers and after much trial and error, I would never buy any other brand except Nylabone. Nothing else lasts as long and occupies them as Nylabone does. They always fight over this one in particular - perhaps they like it because it is much larger than all their other Nylabones. This is definitely the largest one I have seen, so I would only recommend this for someone with a large dog. I would recommend anything Nylabone if you want your dogs to chew a toy instead of your furniture!"
5,The only bone my dogs can't destroy.,My dogs chew up black walnuts like popcorn. They can go through a cow femur in 30 minutes. The Galileo bone is the first chew that lasts. Highest recommendation!
4,Good for aggressive chewers,"Solidly made, good for dogs with a history of easily destroying toys. My dog prefers his regular nylabone more than the Galileo but this one is definately more bullet-proof. The most indestructible toy we've owned...and that's saying something."
4,"Good to know about her, but after 2nd view, too much?","I knew her only through CD, so this is a great disc for me to get to know her better (about her personality, etc). But from 2nd time, I wish I have option to watch only her concert, not all of those interviews everytime."
5,Great!!,"This was great! got it as a christmas gift for my friend, and she loved it! A must have for any real Taylor Swift fan!"
5,awesome,I bought this for my girlfriend for christmas and she loved it! i even watched it and i thought it was good! great movie if you like taylor swift.
5,best buy exclusive,"the blu-ray version is a best buy exclusive, get it there while you still can instead of buying it here, it's much cheaperalthough if you're willing to wait, i think amazon will start offering the blu-ray version in january for a more reasonable price than the third party sellers"
3,"Lovely, but ruined with tape!","The bracket is lovely and sturdy, but not sure who thought it would be a good idea to wrap packing tape around the arm of of the holder, just in front of the hook. It would not peel off, had some white paper stuck under it, so it was very visible. We are using this in our kitchen, so that was unacceptable. (If there were a way to upload a photo, I would as proof) It took me forever to get the tape off, then nearly an hour using Goo Gone to get all the sticky stuff off. Tacky. (Pun intended!) Almost returned it."
4,Better than the First,"This installment finds the swashbuckling lieutenant assigned to the suppression of piracy in the far east. His reputation is still with him and makes his superiors a bit distrustful but that does not stop him. He has a job to do and will get it done.The pirates about Hong Kong are causing lots of losses and that is the immediate problem. Someone is feeding them information and many want the British colony to fail. Besides the pirates, the Chinese government is humiliated by its loss in the Opium War and would like to see the western devils brought down a few pegs. So too would some of the taipans who are scheming for ever more wealth and power.Killigrew falls in love in the episode. The results of that foray are even more tragic than those of the first book but lend to the depth and passion of the story. It is a good story and worth reading."
4,What Happens In Vegas,"This movie is HILARIOUS!! It was surprisingly funny but also a very sweet story when it gets down to it. I loved it and that's the reason why I bought it. NO matter how many times you watch it, you'll always find something to laugh about. Def. for a mature audience due to language and situations, however compared to some movies it is rather tame. I think the chemistry between Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz is wonderful. Also, the banter between their two best friends is great."
3,"OF COURSE IT'S PREDICTABLE, BUT IT DOES HAVE IT'S MOMENTS! 2 1/2 STARS!","Most romantic comedies are pretty much the same and 'What Happens in Vegas is no different than the majority of these types of films, but it does deliver some very funny moments. Diaz and Kutcher are in good form in this predictable, but sometimes funny little movie. If I had any problem with it is that it is a tad too long for such nonsense.The film is a little uneven in tone with some sappy moments mixed with some raunchier fare, but it the end it was enjoyable for what it's worth. I've seen much worse in the genre and much better in films like 'Tootsie' and 'Groundhog Day'."
4,"Fairly Predictable, but still funny","As many other reviewers pointed out, this is a pretty predicatble movie. Two people who do not care for each other being put together in a bonding situation, and after some time, grow to appreciate each other. Been done before. I found this movie still funny and a bit original with the premise of 3,000,000 dollars and two supporting friends who add to the mixed emotions. Cameron Diaz and Aston Kutcher are good, and Dennis Miller as the Judge and Queen Latifa as the Therapist add to the cast nicely. Plenty of laughs and scheming of situations that create enough action to pull you through, even though you know how it is going to end. Worth a purchase, or at least rental."
3,"You get drunk and end up married, go figure!","Jack(Ashton Kutcher) and Joy(Cameron Diaz) are pretty good together. This movie has a lot of funny moments, but is definitly one you rent, not buy. I work at Blockbuster video so I get to see all the new release movies before they come out. I didnt feel this one was a complete dud, I've seen worse. For having nothing else to watch, this was a good way to pass an hour and a half. There was a lot of laugh-out-loud moments as well as some awkward ones. On the crude and vulgar scale, it was about a 2 (10 being the worst). Where Good-luck Chuck was a about a 9(awful movie that one is). So if its a rainy wednesday, go ahead and watch this. Its not that bad."
2,if u must then RENT IT,"If you really intend on watching this movie then go ahead and rent it. Its good for a few laughs induced by some silly comedy but that's just about it. If you have seen one Ashton Kutcher comedy then you have seen them all, his abilities in comedic acting are pretty much one dimensional and try as he might he just could not keep up with Cameron Diaz's comedic skills for sure."
1,No...WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS?,"Don't blink .......No! Really! Don't blink or you could miss it.Thin plot line..... The movie didn't have a lot of direction.....However I loved the first 15minutes.Can't really remember the rest......hummm...Sorry.""What Happened To The Rest Of This Movie?"" What does happen in Vegas? Maybe we are not ment to know? It's a secret....yeah...thats it....its a secret. Lets all just guess what happens in Vegas....Unbox get your act together! The movie has a runtime of only 15 minutes.But not to worry I have heard that unbox has just released the extended version of What Happens in Vegas ....SO.... FOR ONLY ANOTHER $14.99 YOU CAN OWN THE EXTENED VERSION WHICH HAS A RUNTIME OF 16 MIN AND 3/8.JUST KIDDIN'.........16min and .......5/8."
2,What the?????,"Is it me or is there a HUGE anti asian slam in this movie? With absolutely no relevance to the story? What does the director have against asians? As for the movie Cameron Diaz predictable she plays the same character in every movie she makes, Aston Kutcher same as Cameron."
3,An Ok Lark,"A surprisingly decent movie of this type mainly due to Aston Kutcher and Cameron Diaz .If you like this kind of movie, its OK for a couple of hours."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,I really was surprised after watching this movie about just how entertaining it was. To be honest I ws expecting something I was going to suffer through with a couple laughs. Sure there is not much to think about and it was a somewhat typical romantic flick but it was worth the time spent watching. Both Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz were funny and played wonderful roles. My biggest negative is that sometimes it got redundant when they were trying to screw up each other lives and it would have been nice to see them start to connect with each other for a longer period of time.If you want a good fun movie that doesn't require thinking and can give you some laugh out loud moments then this is an excellent choice.
3,stupid and funny at the same time,"It was an ok movie with some funny parts. I enjoyed it because I rented it ""on demand"" for only $4. If I would have bought it for $20, I would have been upset. So basically, if you want to RENT IT, go ahead. If you want to BUY it, don't!"
4,What happens in vegas,"This review is written by Mr. Bradberry's students:our movie is What Happens in Vegas,one we were supperised that how funny it was.this movie Stared Cameron Diaz and Aston Kutcher,What Happens in Vegas is a drumatic Comedy with two good Actors that make the movie good.This movie has some romantic and funny scenes. There's no need to see the movie because it's the normal story line. A guy meets a girl they fight, and get back toghther. We think this movie is the best because of it's funny scenes and you'll be laughing the hole way through the movie."
4,Funny,Love it. Expecially anything that has to do with Las Vegas. Ashton and Camron make a great couple in this movie.
3,movie,This movie was worth watching...but once would probably be enough. I think the best parts were in the commercials. it was delivered quickly and in good shape.
1,WOW,"I can't believe they let movies this bad finish production. This movie is awful, not funny in anyway, and the only person who might like it is a 12 yr old girl"
2,What a stink bomb,"I only gave it 2 stars because Ashton was soooo handsome, but the movie stinked ,passed it on to my teenage daughter who by the way likes it, go figure."
1,Defective Blu-ray Amazon only refunded 50%,I recieved this for my birthday along with a few other Blu-ray's and when we put it in to watch it a week later it skipped constantly and was not even watchable.Since it had been a week over the 30 days since it was purchased (FOR A GIFT) Amazon would not replace it but after I spent $7 shipping it back they gave us a credit of $14. So in reality the disc cost over $31 and I got $7 back to replace it. Way to treat your Amazon Prime customers. I guess I wont be buying anymore gifts or making any wishlists again.
4,Surprisingly Great Movie,"From the cheesy trailer, I wasn't expecting much of this movie. It looked like an over-the-top, slapstick comedy, that would be average at best. It was actually a pretty darn good movie, to my surprise. Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher had VERY good chemistry, and it was extremely believable, and even tear-inducing at points.I laughed out loud a number of times, and like I said before, also welled up with tears a few times as well. Sure, not an oscar-worthy movie by any means, but it was HIGHLY entertaining, and just a very, very solid movie from beginning to end."
3,Should have stayed in Vegas alittle longer,"Ashton Hutcher and Cameron Diaz are great in this film.I just wish they would have stayed in Vegas alittle longer because after they leave,the moive starts to slip.With better writting,and maybe Demi Moore in the lead,this moive would have been more of a hit."
1,Love the movie but....,Love this movie but we ordered it through Amazon prime movie selections. We paid $3.99 for a 24 our rental in the afternoon and decided halfway through the movie to run some errands. When we sat down to finish the movie it made us put our pin number back in and charges us again....this was just a few hours after purchased the first one. Will be taking this up with Amazon after the New Year!!
5,great movie,"Great movie, one of Mr favorites. Very funny without having to say nasty words every 5 seconds. Cameron and Ashton are great together. Great supporting cast also."
3,Pretty funny,I liked this movie and it had it's laugh out loud moments but could have done with less of the crude humor.
3,"What Naps in Vegas, or is it Happens","A little slow, not as funny as advertised ,but still a good movie. Was still enjoyable."
2,WHat's all this anti-Chinese in the movie?,"I am really surprised at this sub-plot of coming back again and again to portray Joy's Chinese colleague in the worst possible stereotype. While I liked the movie and found the leading actors cute and funny I couldn't figure out the racist approach everytime Joy's Chinese colleague had to say something or do something. The scenes at work or in the boardroom or in the boss's house or in the night party with the Chinese woman with her Chinese husband? I thought that was far too much and I thought all this confirms it was done on purpose. Maybe it is fashionable now to bash China? What others think about this? I did not also appreciate the portrayal of other minorities in the movie, such as the African American guy who arrived in a police suit. Is the movie telling us that only this couple of mainstream white Americans can be truly ""American"" and that Joy's boss found a connection with her husband (Ashton) because he displayed some cultural treats?"
1,Absolutely terrible.,"So bad a movie I couldn't finish it. I like crazy, funny and foolish movies but this movie was absolutely horrible. Not even FUNNY!"
5,GREAT,I BUY SO MANY DVD'S FROM YOU FOLKS. THEY ALWAYS GET HERE ON TIME AMAAZON GIVE THE BEST SERVICE OF ANYBODY ELSE
4,QUELLE SURPRISE!,"When you can have John Wesley Harding sing Serge Gainsbourg's ""Je Suis Venu Te Dire Que Je M'En Vais"" why do you need anything else? Okay, JW Harding's version is still not Gainsbourg's (which cannot be imitated or surpassed). But this clever arrangement of songs by contemporary artists performing French pop standards is a classic in itself. Air (French band) team with classic French pop star Francoise Hardy to provide a lovely version of ""Jeanne"". Probably my favourite track here, apart from John Wesley Harding, is Ivy's rendition of ""L'anamour"". One of my favourite songs anyhow, and Ivy has a very pleasant sound. There were other surprises... like Luna, Magnetic Fields, and other things. I think, if you enjoy, French pop-or any of the bands on the album-this is a must have. An updated, modern version (tribute, even) to the standards of French romantic pop. It was a great treat for me, at least."
3,promising but uneven collection of a neglected genre,"Good idea, especially with Air-Francoise Hardy, Luna, Ivy, the Hang-ups and Godzuki. But I would have liked to have seen April March or Stereolab in here in place of Kevin Ayers, though his track grows on you. FYI: To all the critics of Lloyd Cole who call him gauche for translating Dylan's ""If You Got To Go"" into French, it's not his fault! Blame Fairport Convention, who did ""Si Tu Dois Partir"" on their 1968 album ""Unhalfbricking."" So Cole's actually covering Fairport Convention covering Bob Dylan."
1,Destroys Baudelaire,"In the poem ""Le Soleil"" (The Sun), Crosby translates the words ""secrete luxures,"" as ""lubricious evils."" The phrase in French literally and simply means ""secret lusts."" Time and again throughout the book, Crosby foists his own meaning on Baudelaire, distorting the intent of the author. In the same poem, a line which translates literally as ""sniffing in every corner the chance of a rhyme,"" Crosby writes, ""Sniffing for lucky rhymes at every thingamabob."" He uses this monstrously unpoetic and incorrect vocabulary to make a rhyme with ""job"" in the preceding line. This translation is frequently clumsy and wrong, and if you can't read French, there is little point in reading this, because it is not Baudelaire."
4,An exposition of the poet's thought,"This work is a very clearly written and coherent exposition of the thought of the poet W. S. Merwin. The text is punctuated throughout with illustrative selections from the poetry of Merwin. The central idea is that Merwin is a mythmaker a man devoted to created a mythology which explains Creation and the Universe as a whole.I was frankly expecting something much different, an analysis of Merwin's poetic method and technique. This is not a central element of the work.I too must admit that the whole enterprise , the whole idea of the Poet as Mythmaker is not one which strikes home with me. Again the book is clear , well- written and reads the whole of the poet's work until the mid- eighties.Merwin towards the tail- end of this volume is described as moving to a more personal and private poetry. A more detailed exposition of that, and the connection of the Life and the Work would have more interested me much more.But I am only one reader and one kind of reader."
5,The BEST Dog Food around,"I have 2 dogs, a border collie and a german shepherd/golden retriever mix. I started feeding them this food when my Aunt reccomended it. Let me tell you, my dogs barely shed anymore! I used to have tumble weeds of dog hair swirling around my wood floors, no more! It's the omega 3 & 6 that does it. Aside from the healthier coat, they also have smaller bowel movements, this is because there is little to no filler in the food. The dogs are able to use digest all of the food. Unlike most dog food, there is no corn meal. I highly reccomend the Wellness brand."
3,Good know-how book for someone just starting out.,"If you are a beginning photographer this is a fine book. It describes step by step the process of taking pictures with your SLR camera. It also explains the stuff you need to know about metering, lenes, filters and all the other info you should know to become a good photographer."
4,True Princess Dress,"I bought this dress to wear to my child's 3 year old class Halloween party. Another 3 year old little girl dressed as Snow White came up to me and just stared at me as if I was her Fairytale Princess come to life. It was worth the money to see those child's eyes in amazement. Gown came in one size, fits women's 10-14. Blue part is stretchy, yellow bottom does need ironing."
4,This is a very important book to whom wants understand the nervous system .,"I liked this book, it's difficult to find out texts about central nervous system from invertebrate species. I miss more caps. about crab's nervous system, but it will be very usefull in my research."
5,Great Supportive Show,"I run daily on my treadmill and needed something new to replace my old Asics. Went into a running specialty store and was told from measuring my foot, looking at it, and looking at my older shoes that I needed something supportive as I was an overpronator (or something like that). Tried on several shoes and liked this one the most in the store.Anyway, after running and biking with the shoe, I love it. Very comfy and feels much more supportive than my old shoe AND it is still lightweight and cute.I highly recommend this shoe."
3,Indoors not Outdoors,"This shoe would probably be just great for indoors, treadmill, gym, indoor track etc. Unfortunately I was looking for a shoe more suited for outdoors..and winter. I'm not expecting a snow boot, but something a bit more substantial. They're very lightweight, and very good support for flat feet, so if that's what you want - go for it. I found them to run a bit small. If I wanted a nice light indoor shoe that feels supportive (didn't wear them much at all because I'm returning them) I'd consider it..but 1/2 size larger."
1,shipping fee not refunded,"I really like these shoes, I've worn them before. I ordered one size a different size was sent. I think it was a problem with the ordering system, and told the company that. The company promptly returned my money but did not refund the return shipping. Won't order from them anymore"
5,Awesome,"When I saw the movie at the theater, I knew I had to buy it. It's amazing, totally recommend it."
5,great action packed movie,"this is a super great movie. fast,action packed. there was never a dull or slow moment in this movie. truly a 5 star movie. no question about it."
5,Amazing,Great product at an excellent buy. The product was exactly as described with all the different avenues of viewing. For all these car fans it's a great fast paced movie that helps to capitalize on the fast and furious past of the original movies.
4,Fast and Fun,"The last three sequels hardly offered anything new, you just had more fast cars and more races. So I didn't expect much from Fast Five at all. However the movie is surprisingly fun and exciting, due to better writing and direction.The fast cars and races are still in the movie of course, but here you have the addition of a Ocean 11 like heist plot and the Rock as a relentless special agent named Hobbs that will do anything to get Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel) and his team.I just don't understand why Han (Sung Kang) from Tokyo Drift is back with no explanation to how he's still alive, since didn't he die in that movie ? But that's easy to ignore since Fast Five is fun either way and the best action film of the year so far."
1,Love the movie,This DVD stops in the middle of the show. Now I am going to buy another and not a used one.
3,Grainy on a Galaxy Tab 10.1,"Though I bought and downloaded the HD version, the portable copy that I moved to my Galaxy Tab 10.1 is so grainy Toreto looked like bald Mario on Atari. I suggest Amazon would offer a variation of movie video screen size formats to match with a portable player, not just ""one screen size fits all""."
5,Un final inesperado,"La película brinda al espectador lo que espera de ella: Acción - Adrenalina. Está salpicada con escenas de humor que hacen interesante la trama. Los actores... Wao!!! Pero el final, después de los créditos... ofrece a los que hemos seguido con interés la historia, una chispa de expectación de cara a una sexta entrega.The film gives the audience what it expects: Action - Adrenalina. Is peppered with scenes of humor that make an interesting plot. Actors ... Wao! But the end, after the credits ... offers those who have followed with interest the story, a spark of anticipation ahead of sixth F & F."
2,Worst of em all,This part of the Fast and Furious franchise was the worst of them all to me. Some people may think diferentely about it but I thought it was horrible and too long and drawn out. Hang it up guys.
2,Misleading Advertisement,"I purchased this product because the title of the product advertised ""... + Digital Copy in DVD Packaging""I was extremely upset and dissapointed when I found that the digital download code had expired and is not redeemable.Misleading Advertisement!!"
3,"Good....but,foul language","The movie was fantastic but,has horrible language in it.You can't see a good action movie anymore without it saying offensive language and it was a dissapointment."
3,fun action film...,"pretty good action film with hunk Vin Diesel and alot of other gorgeous men (and some pretty ladies); weakest points to me, (1) why oh why do villains leave a torture scenario en mass leaving one or two inept torturers behind so the heros can escape (Lethal Weapon, Taken, and this film), and (2) 100% unbelievable that Dwayne Johnson would join the heist or let the criminals go in the end - just so not happening. He may have helped them get less time, but let them walk, not. Favorite part - the beautiful baby boy who played Nico, his smile as he was being put to bed, gorgeous baby. I'd give this film 3 and a half stars and I liked it well enough to buy it."
5,excellent show,bought this show for my wonderfull husband and he loves it he cherishes his stuff so much and i really do like that
2,Just more of the same,"**1/2""Fast Five,"" so named because it is the fifth entry in the highly lucrative ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, finds our intrepid band of car-racing criminals, played by Vin Diesel , Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, masterminding a heist against a South American crime lord played by Joaquim de Almeida . Wayne Johnson joins the cast as an American Secret Service agent hot on the trio's trail.Replete with wafer-thin characters, corny one-liners, substandard acting and muddled moral messaging, the movie culminates in a spectacular, though really rather ludicrous, car chase through the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Strictly for aficionados of vroom-vroom storytelling."
5,best yet.,really enjoyed the movie. hands down the best of the franchise so far. over the top and action packed! what more can you ask for? cannot wait for the next one!
5,THE FAST AND FURIOUS PLUS,"CONSTANT ACTION - WATCH THIS MOVIE SEVERAL TIMES , YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING MORE AND DIFFERENT EACH TIME THAT YOU MISSED. EXCELLENTOOO MOVIE"
5,One of the BEST that my MONEY CAN GET in terms of CAR SPECIAL EFFECTS and EXCITEMENT,"When I first saw its trailer in the theatre, I thought it's going to be another bad sequel. How wrong I was! I have watched Fast Five both in the theatre and at home. Every time, I was absolutely entertained. That's the feeling I haven't got for a long time after watching action films.The excitement is non-stop from the beginning till the end. I'm sorry, I can't go into details here. Otherwise, it will ruin your excitement.The special effects with cars are the best that I've ever seen so far. Especially, in the last scene where 2 cars pulled the vault into the street. Of course, I had to suppress my logic to enjoy the movie. If you like action scenes with cars, you don't want to miss this one.In short, this is the best of all action sequences. It's also one of the BEST that my MONEY CAN GET. I own a DVD copy of it."
5,Best of the Five,"Fun and entertaining, just what it should be. Went more the direction of a heist movie, but that's what made it work. How many times can they keep reinventing the same car race & chase movies? I liked the first four *okay*, they were entertaining enough, but this one was much more refreshing than any of the other sequels have been. And don't get me wrong, this is not Oceans 14. This is a tough-guy, fast-paced action heist movie. Maybe more like the Italian Job."
3,A bit disappointing,The movie was excellent thats really the reason I bought it. However it did not come with its original case which I really hated. I collect movies and without the case it was pointless buying it from this buyer.
5,Fast Five DVD/Blu-Ray,"Great movie with lots of action. The latest in the Fast and Furious series. Loved fight scenes with the ""Rock"" and Vin Diesel. Great driving scenes."
2,Fast Five,Movie was absolutely good. But I was very disappointed to find out it was a rental and it did not permit me enjoy the extras (features or bonus). I will surely read betternext time. I felt cheated.
1,Extended cut is not very extended,"This is not a review of the movie. There are enough reviews already on Amazon to decide if you would like to see the actual movie or not. This is a review on the ""Extended Version"" of this movie. You would have to pay close attention to see where the movie was actually extended. It adds a few frames and has slight differences that cause the movie to be about 70 seconds longer than the original and only slightly different in some scenes (different angles, etc.). This website shows the differences for each scene---- www (dot) movie-censorship (dot)com/report (dot) php?ID=149783 . It seems to me that the extended version doesn't add much that theatrical version doesn't already have and what is added doesn't seem to make it better."
2,"Great Movie, but this disk comes in a DVD case","Yes its a small issue, but when you buy a Blu Ray it should come in a blu ray case. All I have are blu rays on my shelf and this one doesn't fit. Needs to be the little blue jeweled case like all other blu rays."
4,Best of Fast Serious Yet!,"*I am a fan of this type of movie. I've seen all of the Fast & Furious flicks. This is the best one so far. Dwayne Johnson adds a new dimension. He plays well against the other characters.If you like lots of action, gun fights, car crashes and stunts, then this is your movie"
4,The Sequels Just Keeps Getting Better,"I really liked this sequel even more than the original and the other sequels so far because the scenery in Brazil and the music were so amazing. Also, I loved to see The Rock and Vin Diesel doing the action scenes together, BUT I felt they got a little too carried away with breaking walls in the fight scene.The cars and the driving were great, of course; and then the little teaser at the end was a welcomed surprise. Looking forward to the next sequel. :)Fast Five (Extended Version)is a great action move and a great compromise for my husband and I to watch together 'cause there's also a good love story in it, too."
3,The series is getting away from street racing ...,"Was this film part of the Fast and Furious series or ""The Italian Job 2""? At times I wasn't sure. A lot less street racing and nice cars in this film, a lot more over-the-top action scenes and steroid-enhanced testosterone. Oh well, at least it was better than Tokyo Drift!Ranked in order of enjoyability:Fast and Furious (original)Fast and Furious 4Fast FiveToo Fast, Too FuriousTokyo DriftIt was kind of cool they brought some of the characters back from all the movies in the series but they kind of over did it I thought. At times the movie seemed too gimmicky to me."
2,Fast Five,"Worst out of the ""Fast"" franchise. Outrageously unrealistic. The whole thing was ridiculous. Would not waste my time on this."
3,Should've been filled by Amazon and come with 2 day shipping.,"It is always nice to receive Christmas gifts quickly and in good condition, as it makes it easier to get them wrapped in time. I would have liked to get this a little quicker though. Especially since I had clicked on having it filled by Amazon and therefore should have received the free 2 day shipping that comes with a Prime account."
3,Acceptable..,"I ordered this movie which was supposed to be in ""brand new perfect condition"", I received it far from promptly which wasn't was a big deal but when I opened the package the case was smashed in (when it was stated case in perfect condition, still in orginal wrapping and everything) and also when I played the movie it had a glitch in it (the movie freezes during one scene)I had to start the movie all over and fast forward to the next chapter completely. So that was upsetting considering I was expecting a movie in brand new condition which obviously means no scratches or skipping. The movie itself I loved, first time I saw it (which is why it was even more frustrating I had to miss the whole part where it stops working, during the last car chasing scene too!)"
1,This Movie Sucks (and you can hear it suck from six blocks away),"I bought this for a friend who likes movies with no plot beyond car crashes, explosions, bullets flying, and women with long hair. He loved this movie. Say no more.I watched the movie at his house with Wall-O-Sound or whatever it is that blasts the noise at you loudly from all directions. It is used effectively in this movie. It is overused so frequently that I advised him to check his house foundation after the movie."
1,Locks up my PS3,I don't know if this movie is good or bad. As soon as I try to play it on my Playstation 3 it locks it up hard and I'm forced to unplug it to shut it down.I'm forced to rate this at 1 star for being the only brand new DVD I've ever had that won't work on my PS3. I have also made sure to update my PS3 to the latest version.
2,fun mindless but mega un realistic,pretty darn un realsitickinda a cowboy movie with carspainfully predictableso un realistic it hurts
1,transformers would have been more realistic,"should've saved my five bucks and rented transformers. what a stupid, stupid movie. i expected stupid, but i really expected a little more entertainment. boring and retarded."
5,Fast pace,"Great cast, awesome popcorn flick and eye candy. Vin Disel and the Rock need I say more ;-)I have always enjoyed the Fast and Furious series. And with the cliff hanger at the end (no spoilers) I can not wait until the next installment :-)"
5,fast five,ok if you want reality stay away from the movies. if you want a break from reality and a good time that has fast cars and some seriously awsome driving then watch this movie. they pull a safe out of a wall with two cars. is this reality no but is this an awsome way to steal some crooks money oh yeah! The fight scene holds no limits and will be hard to top in the future fasts. I am waiting to buy it and add it to my collection. i hope in the deleted scenes they have vins race for pinks. watch the movie and you will know what i mean.
4,Good movie but predictable,"It was good movie with a lot of car chases, fight scenes and good story line. However, it was pretty predictable how it was going to end."
4,Great Movie,"I have been a fan of the Fast and Furious since the beginning. They lost their way on Tokyo Drift so I am glad to see redemption with this movie. Great cast, it is the best of the best! Action is amazing and the fight scene between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson is one of the best I have ever seen! This movie is great eye candy for the ladies and all the action for the men!"
4,As Advertised,"Movie came as advertised and in a timely fashion, would purchase from seller again. Great movie, definately recommend seeing it and buying it, Fast and Furious movies just keep upping the ante."
1,"I really wanted to like this, I really did.","**spoiler alert.I wanted to like this, but once again a stupid ending ruined an otherwise ok movie. I was even enjoying it a bit and began to think maybe this will be better than 2 through 4, but in the end when they completely defy the laws of physics and have to cars--that might weigh 3000lbs each--that have a combined HP of maybe 1000hp (if tuned) and have a two inch x ten inch tire patch (times four driving tires) pulling a safe that has to be half a million pounds that was built into a building. Not only do they pull it, somehow their mass is enough to whip it like a water skier behind them and smash it through buildings all while going maybe sixty or seventy mph though a city. There is zero chance any two cars in history could have moved that thing an inch...come on people. Really, I know it's just a movie but this is just stupid.Just stupid."
1,Battlefield Earth BAD,"After watching this movie and seeing the reviews posted here, I hope for the sake of our country that the studios are paying people to post 5 star reviews. This is the worst movie I have seen in decades. I would go through everything that I found jaw dropping stupid about this movie but I need to begin my healing process and try and forget."
1,it takes to long to get the movie in the mail,"I preordered this movie on sept 24, they said i won't get it until oct 12. Thats to long, should've went to walmart."
1,on principle,i haven't seen this movie but i guarantee it doesn't deserve a 4 and a half rating so just on that i give it 1 out of 5
2,NOT A BLURAY CASE,"i have quite a few blurays and hddvd's and they are all uniform height. i have adjusted the shelves to fit them. So i order this bluray and it comes in a FULL SIZE CASE that now will now fit on my shelf. NOT COOL, very dissapointed."
4,miXing the points,"As understood, nice police officers had justice taken in their hands by stealing voult of not nice guys from a storage.Near a sci-fiction story with blood, murdering and questionable moral."
2,Disappointed Fan,"I'm on the same boat as J.G. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I am a huge fan of the series having bought the DVDs and the Blurays for all 4 (so far) so I Was really looking forward to this. Throughout the movie there were a lot of suspension of disbelief (as you should) in any movie. Mainly on what cars can and can't do but there are some things that go to far.If it would have been in the context of fantasy (Harry potter casting a spell and a giant magical elephant pulls the safe out the window, or Yoda uses the force and pulls it out) Then YES by all means I can be like ""oh well it's a movie. The force is strong within him"".However, when it's 2 real cars pulling a real safe out of a wall I just can't swallow it. I really ruined the movie for me and should for anyone that's ever watched Mythbusters. More than likely they would have just sat there spinning their wheels until their tires exploded or the cable would have snapped."
5,Spectacular,The scene with the safe and all the car crashes was absolutely my favorite part. Paul walker and vin diesel really made good actors for this type of movie. Brilliant!
3,a fun movie ...,"This is a fun movie to watch - lots of action, really sweet fast cars, very hot women (But there's one that's a little too skin and bones for me...) but several are very HOT... - I've seen all 5 of the fast and furious movies and this is the best of the 5, the first is very good also. Some of the stunts were obviously very dangerous and I was like no way they'd be dead (over and over again) - sometimes my prior physics/engineering training keeps me from really enjoying a movie because I can see how unrealistic they are ... but it's fun and some of the scenes are just classic .. it's a little slow at times and lost my attention - so that's why I'm giving this 3 stars because if it could keep me glued then it would get more - and it isn't getting more because it isn't realistic enough to hold my attention all the way but honestly it's a very fun movie to watch - enjoy"
2,stops and continue...,"The movie itself is great. I'm a big fan of Fast and Furious movies... For this item (both theatrical and extended versions), I noticed that at one part of the movie (where Dom & Bryan are having conversation that they will do the final job and disappear forever), the film stopped at the part of Dom's line ""...forever"" with no sound and continued again.:-(( I watched this in the big screen and didn't notice that."
1,"This was the worst of the series, without a question","At least the other movies were plausible. This one was absolutely ridiculous. I cannot believe that anyone likes it. They just pretend to because the critics were paid off to like this junk. I almost walked out in the last hour of the movie, it was that ridiculous. I don't believe all the good reviews on here, I really don't."
2,blu ray purchase,I ordered and received the blu ray on time but it would not play. It kept freezing up and one time it stopped and returned to the main menu on it's on. I contacted Amazon and they promptly returned my money including shipping and even provide a return lapel at their expense. I was not happy with the disc but I am very pleased as to how I was treated by Amazon and I continue to purchase from them. I just wish that everyone treated their customers with the same level of customer satisfaction that Amazon does. They are a very reputable site and I am very pleased with them. I shop their site all of the time and just recently bought Richy Rich and two car alarm remotes and they were top notch products.
2,Fast Five,"I don't know why so many people like this movie.Sure it had cool cars but that alone doesn't make it a good movie.I thought it was boring.I usually like Dwayne Johnson but I just didn't like him in this movie.I didn't really care for any of the characters except for Han.He's the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1.Maybe If I was a guy or if I was into racing,I would've like it better.This movie was to long and I was glad when it was over."
2,Cheesier than Craft Macaroni and cheese,"It was an entertaining movie and I'd watch it again, because of the action. I found the dialog to be a bit corny and some of the behavior unnecessary (you found the hideout and they're on satellite. Is it necessary to be fly'n thru the streets and bouncing around in your armored cars to get to their location?)"
3,Ocean's Eleven on Steroids,"One of the better of the F&F; series, but it's like watching Ocean's Eleven (2001) on steroids. Plenty of action, but more shoot 'em up than the rest of the series. I guess you got to have lots of shooting with ""The Rock"" in a movie. Probably in his contract. Anyhow it's fast and bloody, so it will be a big hit. Look forward to the next one, since the ending shows a tease about who comes back from the dead next time.Nothing else to say that already hasn't been said. Good movie, but not fantastic."
5,Good entertainment,"Don't buy this expecting it to be realistic. If you've made it 5 movies into this series then you know by now to expect ridiculous cars, stunts, and plot. If you want a couple hours of mindless entertainment then this is the move for you."
4,Fast Five DVD,"Ordered this DVD for my husbands birthday. The movie is great! Fast cars, great action and a good cast. Got this from Amazon as they can always get it for me at a few dollars less than I would have to pay in a store."
5,must have,This book is timeless !!If you want something to make you think and answer questionsat the same time then this book is for you.I believe that it has something for everyone.
5,Prescription for Living,"The subject of this challenging book is man's present unhappiness, confusion, and uncertainty. The author has peculiar qualifications to write on this problem. Canadian by birth, growing up in the Western world, Ruhiyyih Rabbani married in 1937 the head of the Bahai Faith, one of the most remarkable spiritual movements of our time. She lives in Haifa, at the foot of Mount Carmel, and adds to her own experienc of East and West, through worldwide travel and correspondence, a deep appreciation and understanding of human beings of diverse races and cultures.With sympathy, assurance and humour, the author phases, in homely terms, truths which are at once arresting and provacative. She speaks directly to the individual of the dynamic laws of spiritual life - the presription for living in the world today.--- from book's back cover"
5,Emproved the steering on my 1998 Jeep TJ,"These are high quality ball joints. They greatly improved the steering on my '98 TJ. If you run big tires on your Jeep, you will probably have wore out ball joints within a year or two. I would definately buy these again. You will need a ball joint removal tool and the specail Jeep adapters to replace them. Spend the money a buy the better quality ball joint tools, the cheap ones don't work very well."
2,"So, So for toddlers","I brought this book for my nephrew, Johnavan (1 yr old) but I felt that the language used was more suited for older kids. There are other basic baby books that would appeal more to toddlers."
2,BEWARE OF CIRCUMCISION DETAILS,"This series has some wonderful details of foreign festivals, but the Kenya book is NOT AGE APPROPRIATE for age 4-8, as indicated on the amazon.com summary. The text is more a grade 5-8 level, and there are 4 pages devoted to male and female circumcision of young people, including a definition in the glossary. We ordered it for our K-grade 5 school, and reluctantly, will be returning it, as we feel it is not age appropriate for our students. (And we are a very liberal school.) Our teachers feel it is appropriate for grade 6 and up."
4,very nice CD,i have used this for my evening yoga classes and it is really lovely :) the people tend to find it relaxing and also meditative. very nice!
3,Nerve Endings used book,"The wrong book was sent, and this book never arrived. I read a library copy instead, and the company refunded the money. They were very cooperative, and I will order from them again."
4,not complicated good recipes,I like Williams-Sonoma cookbooks. This has nice photos and easy to follow good recipes.
4,"GIT YOU MAN, WITH THIS ONE!","awesome book,Great foo-foo uptakes for your meat and potatoes guy!sexy beef."
2,Eh.,"After hearing the Prometheus album, I went to buy it but the store only had in stock ""In the Nightside Eclipse"", so I bought it. This is not a very good album at all. Emperor is a great band though, if you take this album out of their discography. Buy any of their albums except for this one."
2,thank God for Cradle of Filth...,"I dont know why people keep calling these guys the founders of Black Metal. Cradle of filth formed three years before this cd came out, and Cradle does this sound a lot better. The man who sings in emperor relies on distortion in his instruments and production to hide the fact that he has no vocal range at all.This band is nice if you like this type of music, but every element on here is one that has been improved upon by more creative bands like Cradle of Filth. So if you like this cd I would recomend Midian and Lovecraft & witch hearts."
5,Great Cd,"i got this cd and anthems to welkin at dusk and im not disappointed with either of them.but in the nightside eclipse is a classic,i love every song on it.my favorite on it though is beyond the great vast forest.inno a satana is proally my second favorite.and even the remakes they did were really good,i mean they werent as good as the originals(but then who can beat bathory and no one has a voice like king diamond) but still emperor did a really good job with both of them.its a shame they broke up though.but hey if u like black metal or emperor and still havent got this cd.stop reading this and buy it!"
5,"Dark, disturbed, Satanic, blood-splattered, fantastic.","Sadly, niether of Emperor's releases after this one were quite as good. The images this music inspires, are of cold, blood splattered, Norse landscapes. Five minutes into the album you can actually feel the cold and loneliness of a Norweigan winter. The band seem to play with sort of a fond nostalgia of pagan, non-christian times, and you feel it to. Its like Emperor are trying to drown you in atmosphere. If you have not heard Emperor don't run out and buy this album. Move backwards slowly from IX Equilibrium, to Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, and finally to Nightside. Once you hear Nightside for the first time you will realize it was completely worth it."
5,LONG LIVE NORWAY!,"As a fan of Emperor's latest album, Prometheus, and its melodic vocals and instrumentalization, I was skeptical about buying this CD. I thought that it might be a bit too heavy and Satanic for my tastes. To my surprise, I loved it as soon as the intro to ""Into the Infinity of Thoughts"" graced my speakers. Yes, this is a very brutal CD, not at all intended towards weak-stomached listeners. However, it is also very enjoyable. Ihsahn screams a lot more than on Prometheus and sounds a lot better when he does. The recording quality, while complained of by many people, actually makes this sound a lot better. I really like how the keyboards and guitar seem to merge together, creating one huge instrument. Overall, this is a great CD by a great band. Do not hesitate to buy it. ..."
5,Godlike black metal,"What more can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? This is a black metal masterpiece. Emperor was one of the first black metal bands to use keyboards in their music and now look at how many bands do that. After this album was released the world of black metal was changed forever. The music on this is very brutal and fast, and has that underproduced black metal sound. Although this album is brutal, the keyboards balance it out, making this album a brutal, yet beatiful masterpiece full of amazing epic songs. On first listen, this CD may seem just mediocre to you, but trust me listen to it a few more times it will grow on you and you won't be able to take it out of your CD player. All the songs are great but the best song would have to be ""Beyond the Great Vast Forest"". Buy this if you like black metal of any kind."
4,Pure black metal beauty,"This is by far Emperor's greatest release and unfortunately looks to be there greatest ever. With Anthems to the Welkin At Dusk they succumbed to the 3rd generation black metal posers and sold out. But In The Nightside Eclipse is a true classic of black metal. The best thing about Emperor is their classic usage of keyboards to complement and not destroy the rest of the music. The compositions are so brilliant and beautiful that i'm not sure if it can be classified as black metal. Unfortunately, the musicianship is not the best as the band seems to have a little trouble staying together at times. The recording isn't the best either with some bass drum kicks sounding like a snappy pop instead of bass and depth. The only reason i give 4 stars is that the recording does not give justice to such an album. Still, In The Nightside Eclipse is a powerful work of black metal and should be heard by anyone intelligent enough to appreciate this style of black metal that has been lost."
3,It's OK,"Not my particular taste, I have the CD, and just want to get it out of my recommendations list. If you love black metal, this is the album for you. Read the big review- that is a good one."
5,Probably the BEST BM album of all time.,"For sure THIS is Emperor's landmark album, just brilhiant atmosphere and at the same time there's a lot of extreme parts here, this album has: beautiful atmosphere , it has a romantic feeling sometimes and it's completely DARK and obscure, the bad production just add an evil touch to the role sound and makes this cd the best of it's genre."
4,A must for any black metal fan,"The debut from the gods of black metal is nothing short of amazing. Despite the strange (I wouldn't call it bad) production, this album is incredibly dark and mystical. Sure, its got its blast beats and tremelo guitars, but because the production is so atmospheric, the keyboards really come though in some of the songs, especially on Into the Infinity of Thoughts. The lyrics are also really well done, they sort of tell a story. There's also very little singing in this album compared to their later stuff.While I don't think this is Emperor's best work, it is far from bad. I'd say this is also a great album for those just getting into black metal because it is fairly melodic, but anyone with a taste for darker music will like it."
3,Great Black Metal. Terrible Production values.,"This is one of the best black metal albums ever. The music is a 5. Production, however, is another story enirely.Unfortunately, it more or less sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement on a 4 track. The use of keyboards is really wild, even today. Back then, no one else was doing this kind of stuff. The prog-rock meets ambient vibe was revolutionary. Recommended for serious metal fans and musicians. Audiophiles can avoid it though. If you own a nice speaker system, you will cry as this album will still sound like it being played through a tinny boombox from 1985.I really wish they'd do a remaster. This album is seriously the worst mixed of any I've ever heard in my life.edit: This is a review of the Century Media release from the late 90s. This review may be getting posted under several versions of the album."
4,A bit overrated but still good...,"I recently got into black and death metal and I bought this because I've heard such good things from Emperor, but after hearing Dissection:Storm of the Light's Bane, there isn't much that equals its supremacy...I dunno maybe it's just me but yeah, if you have to pick between this and SOTLB for some reason...get SOTLB its alot better in my opinion."
5,12 great songs by one of the greatest singers ever,"This album is a great introduction to the fine music of Kenny Rogers. It comes at an affordable price, you can pick it up for a few dollars. It mixes a few of his big successful hit's (such as ""Lucille"", ""Ruby"" and ""The Long Arm Of The Law"") with lesser known album cut's (""Mother Country Music"", ""Fighting Fire with fire"", etc).12 classic track here represent Rogers in fine form. If you can afford to spend a but more go for the ""42 ultimate hit's"" cd, but if you can't, this CD will do nicely."
4,Inspiring Book Based On God's Word .,I just bought this Book recently and what I can say in One Word it Exposed to me the truth in Hosea 4.6 My People Perish because of lack of Knoweledge ......The Knoweledge in this Book will open You up to a New world of Breakthroughs .A Must have Copy however Mature You are in the Lord!Joseph Ron Kasozi.
5,Powerful!,"This has helped me change my thinking. I've bought copies for friends and relatives that need hope and a ""how to"" guide for improving situations by speaking differently."
5,"Let this book be your ""secret weapon""","I strongly encourage you to get this book, read it, and then set it close at hand. In so doing, you'll find it to be a ""secret weapon"" that helps you overcome in every area of life.Do you struggle with discouragement, anxiety, or dispair? Get this book.Do you have a health problem? Get this book.Do you have a financial problem? Get this book.This book has some overlap with the book ""The Tongue - A Creative Force"" but is a little more concise and more targeted to the specific issues of finances and health."
5,Wow!,This is a compilation of three of the authors booklets. Each a different area in which God's Creative Power will work in. Apply these prinicples and watch your life change. Great gift idea.
3,"Tries, at least.","Stuart Dischell, Good Hope Road (Viking, 1993)Stuart Dischell is a good poet. He's funny, he's quirky, and his stuff is appealing and readable.So what's the problem? The problem is, simply, that Stuart Dischell is a good poet, and not much else. There's nothing here to pull the reader in, or compel him to turn the pages; nothing that will make this an unforgettable work of poetry. Nothing makes it stand out from the crowd.Readable, yes, but nothing more than that. **"
2,Distortion of the facts,"This is a damaging book that contains lots of distortions and misconceptions. ...the other hand, accusations, particularly when levelled against a whole nation, must be supported by evidence. It is clear that Loftus has not yet learned how to collect that evidence, and has insufficient linguistic and historical knowledge to deal with source material.""<..."
1,TERRIBLE!,"I bought this mp3 player about a year ago and it is awfull. Now if you put new songs on it, it brings up a message that says, error on line:128 (maybe not that exact number but you get the idea). Then you can't turn it off so you have to take out the batteries, and restart it. When it finally starts up it has to put all the songs back on with takes a long time. I wouldn't recommend this at all."
1,Stay away from this inferior MP3 player,The firmware on this device is severely flawed. The firmware update that was meant to fix the original firmware only made things worse; the device takes a long time to initialize; the device reboots when I press the menu button; and very frequently the device displays an error message during initialization. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
2,Would be great if I didn't get a defect,"I got one of these last month and had to return it after using it for a couple of hours. The headphone jack had a bad connection so you have to twist the connector around to get sound. The player refused to power up after the first shutdown and this problem comes back intermittenly. Taking out the battery and putting it back in seems to correct the problem. At one point, the screen display went blank after pushing the power button but hears music playing after pressing the play button. I am going with the Rio Forge."
1,screen malfunction and no tech support,"I bought one of these and the sound was great, everything seemed great. Then after a few weeks of infrequent use the screen just went dead and a line went across the bottom of the screen. It played music fine I just wasn't able to tell what song I was playing. I e-mailed their customer support which promised a response within 24 hours. Two weeks later and still no reply. It is a good thing Costco is so good at taking returns. The return desk at Costco mentioned to me that they had many of these returned for the same problem."
1,"poorly made, poorly designed MP3 player","I bought this player expecting some level of quality and a player that would hold up from a year until high capacity (2GB+) flash players were more readily available and affordable. I was truly disappointed in the Rave MP on the first day. Used is at the gym on a stationary bike for 20 minutes, later would not turn on, changed included battery with known good then it locked during power on, did not unlock in an hour. Sent unit back. Also, poor construction, cover doesn't line up with body, belt clip/holder design seemed like an afterthought not part of the player design or the ergonomics. **** I wasn't expecting much, a working MP3 player that could last a year - this player does NOT deliver"
2,Poor Stereo Headphone Jack connection,In order to receive proper connection you cannot allow the headphone jack to be fully depressed into the mini-plug. Therefore the headset connection is not secure.
1,"If you enjoy reading ""USB Device Not Recognized"" the Rave MP is for you!","I was so happy to get the Rave MP 128 home and was only a little set back by the ""Device Not Recognized"" error message. After all, I had the tech support number and a FAQ to read. The FAQ did not address the question and the tech support blames it on my not having an updated xp, even though I have a month old hp laptop and have updated it twice since Christmas. So, I am stuck with a non-working device, blame shifting techs and a FAQ that should just be called a ""Q"" as they never list the most frequent question: ""How can I get this piece of junk to work?"""
1,No firmware update yet,"According to tech support the firmware update is supposed to fix the memory card problem etc. etc.However, it has been promised since December and is still not available.I returned mine and am getting an iPod. At least I know that will work as advertised."
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"This player seems nice at first, but when you get to know it, well it just stinks. It will freeze, It won't start up, and the recording quality is just horrible."
3,Survey of information,"This book was a bit of a disappointment. It does cover a large range of information relating to the lifestyle and background behind tantric sex. However, the information is not presented at a very sophisticated level, but rather more in an overview style. This would not be so bad except that the book isn't written to ""inspire"" tantric either, because of the clinic information it covers. It's almost like a book report about tantric sex, or an abstract, rather than the full text."
5,Dean Reinmuth,"His video and his book are so good, I went and had a private lesson from him; his knowledge of the golf swing, and his method of teaching are far and above other top name teachers, a must read, and watch for anyone who wants to drastically improve their golf swing. CGG..."
1,"Disappointing, Boring","This time Sue Grafton made a mistake big time. Large portion of the book is taken up by her boring daily life goings: Driving VW, Eating bad food, Talking about her past. Characterisation is bad and the climax is hardly related to the main problem set at the beginning. Besides, I don't understand how obliged one would be to a spouse(whose marriage short-lived and fraught with infidality) divorced 14 years ago? Her whole motive is not believable. Having read many of her other novels, I always have known that she would be, at best, a distant third to the James hadley Chase and the famous Nero Wolfe mysteries written by Rex Stout. But this book does not even justify her being in ""third"" in my list. He must be downgraded fast. To sum up, I really had hard time finishing it."
1,Teach your kids to live by Kinsey's rules?,"Lemme see, first two chapters we've got Kinsey putting down a poor roofer as a ""hairball"" and doing all she can to cheat him. Then she commits two or three felonies, not to aid in catching any criminals, but just so she can cheat the roofer out of an additonal $20. All this money-grubbing after saying, ""I'd just finished a big job, and...my bank account was fat.""I don't think I want my daughters reading this book.Never made it to chapter three."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This was the first Sue Grafton book I have ever read (and probably the last). Decent plotline, but not the greatest. The constant use of profanity turned me off. Mystery whodunits aren't my forte. Then again, I've read much better material."
4,She Keeps You Hooked,"Another captivating mystery by the alphabet mistress herself. Sue Grafton really knows how to tell a story really painting each scene very vividly. Susan really takes you into the personal world of Kinsey Milhoune. You see a vulnerable side to Kinsey as she realizes that she may have wronged her first husband. However, the complications are quite intriguing with the many lives her husband did lead. As complex as this mystery is, Susan Grafton analyzes all aspects of each character and his or her possible connection to the crime. In the end, the perpertrator is revealed leaving you to believe never to leave one stone unturned. This will appeal to most audiences."
4,'O' is for openness....,"And openness is a new characteristic for Kinsey Milhone. Always in the past 14 novels, we've glimpsed at her--she's almost a one dimensional assemblage of characteristics: exercise, junk food, neatness, generosity. It was almost as if Sue Grafton kept a list of personality traits and made sure that Kinsey exhibited them in each novel.But this fifteenth in the series is different: Kinsey confronts her former husband and her former life, and the precipitous descision she made to leave both. The ramifications of her choice spelled disaster and pain for Mickey Magruder and -- ultimately -- for Kinsey the realization that Mickey was a hero of sorts.Yes, this is an exiting mystery novel with the familiar excitment and color of Sue Grafton's excellent series. But ""O"" is more: it is a portrait of an emerging woman who must learn to live with the sorrow of her past and present choices."
3,O is for Okay,"This book certainly didn't live up to my expectations. I was hoping to really get into this tale that delves into Kinsey's past...but I could get only mildly enthused. While the plot illuminates a part of her life with her ex-husband that has heretofore gone unexplored, the overall story lacked luster and verve, and none of the characters--those from either past or present--really grabbed me. I've read all of Grafton's alphabet work, and I'd have to say this is probably the biggest misfire in the series. The next one will be better, no doubt."
4,"""O is for outstanding!""","Finally, some emotional meat on Kinsey's bones. She was beginning to lose interest for me, but now that some of her past has been explained, I can understand, and so enjoy, her again. However, I do wish she would get a real haircut and at least one other dress. She has so much potential...""J"" is still my favorite, but this was a close second. I am anxiously awaiting ""P""."
4,Another vintage Kinsey Millhone!,"I wish Sue Grafton wouldn't wait so long between books; I was slow to get back into the Kinsey Millhone frame of mind. Once in though, I loved it. I thought it was funny(the dog) and poignant.I had to think through the characters,etc. to keep things straight, but I was surprised at the end. I love Kinsey's personal habits and I hope she doesn't change too much in mysteries to come."
1,A Kinsey that I would not want to meet,"Outlaw gets off to a great start involving a storage locker belonging to Kinsey's ex-husband, but then becomes bogged down in characters that lack dimensionality, unlikely events, and Kinsey's angst over her short-lived marriage. This is a nasty and bitter Kinsey that I would not want to meet. Her early ""letters"" gave us an intriguing character in the wonderful setting of Santa Theresa (a thinly disguised Santa Barbara CA). She has since placed most of the action elsewhere and has only minimally developed Kinsey's charactter. Grafton needs to return to the essence of here alphabet series."
4,Grafton's got it back!,"I love Sue Grafton, but N IS FOR NOOSE made me worry that she had run out of steam halfway through the alphabet. No more worries! O IS FOR OUTLAW is the best Kinsey Millhone in a long time. Grafton is in total command here. The writing is assured, the plot is thick, the characters are beautifully drawn. I read it when I should have been doing other things. It's a ""call in sick"" book for sure!Congratulations, Sue!"
5,Grafton is the best!,Sue Grafton has managed to maintain the quality of her Kinsey Millhone stories throughout her excellent series. I both re-read her books and listen to them on tape. Kinsey is a realistic character. We know who she is but her quirks do not take over the books--a pitfall many other writers of mystery series fall into. I keep checking for her next book...
4,Lots of Heart,"Grafton put a lot of heart into this one. The beginning is a great hook. I like my PI's to break the law a little bit. I found some parts of the book a little bit too predictable, and a bit coincidental, and strange (contrived?). I don't know how to explain it without ruining an illogical but thrilling chase scene. I've read this whole series because my sister got me into it, and I realized that a female protagonist can exploit some plot potential that male a can't. For me, O is one of the best in the series because for a change there is something really at stake for Kinsey, something about her that had perhaps been there all along. I love all of her adventures, before and after, but this is the first time I cared about her as a person. Serious readers of the series will kow what I mean. I've read all in the series, but this is the only one I didn't pass on to a friend. This one is a keeper."
1,Very good until the end.,"This is a very good Kinsey book until the ending. I was furious with the author for making such a mistake. My question to Sue Grafton is, ""Why would Kensey drive past her back-up and the Santa Teresa police as she is being chased by someone who clearly intends to her harm?"", stupid!"
3,Broken!,When I received this everything looked in good shape. But when I went to play the first CD there was a large crack in the CD. I could only listen to half of it before it wouldn't play anymore. Very disappointing!
4,Kinsey's back!,"The things that were lacking in ""N"" are back in ""O"" -- the black dress, the index cards, her housekeeping tips, the descriptions of the sandwiches, and her love of QuarterPounders. I wished there could have been more interaction with Jonah. There was only one reference to Dietz; so who knows, this may be the opening for a new man in the next book. As far as the plot, it took me a little while to figure out the ""bad guy"". The scenes with the dog at the roofer's house and also the scene with the cat were enjoyable. Thanks, Ms. Grafton, for letting Kinsey deal with her past, but also keeping her sense of humor! I'm looking forward to ""P""."
4,Good Read,"I have always liked Kinsey and like her more now that I know a little more about one ex-husband. I like the way Grafton dishes out little snippets at a time about KM's past. The books are easy reads, I love the dialogue, and her descriptions of the mundane side of life. Great reading!"
4,Hilarious read,"""O is for Outlaw"" gives us Kinsey at her wise-cracking best! There were times when I was reading that I had to laugh out loud. The story is quite interesting in the details of Kinsey's past, and I find the attention to some otherwise mundane items (jogging, catching up on work at the office, etc.) comforting. It's because Kinsey's a good private investigator that she gives us these details.What is interesting is reading other authors and comparing characters. Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta is the soul of integrity, and I love reading about her. But Kinsey is the ""bad boy/girl"" we would all love to be, if we had the guts to do it! Just a great page-turning chuckle!The only thing I missed in this book was a hard-boiled egg sandwich. Kinsey got me hooked on those!"
3,Sags in the middle,"The first third or so of ""O"" is as good as anything Ms. Grafton has written. It was funny, intriguing, and insightful. Where this goes wrong is in the middle, when Kinsey keeps visiting her old haunt, the ""Tonk"" bar. The patrons were dull and repetitive, and, worse yet, the action seemed to stop completely. One got the sense that the book was supposed to be x pages long, and this was inserted to reach the requisite number. The last part is OK, but it just can't quite save the book. Too bad. I will continue to read Kinsey Millhone adventures and hope for better luck next time."
1,Boring,"At first, I thought that after waiting so long and looking forward to this read, my expectations may have been too high. I have never found a Grafton book difficult to get through until now. It was very boring and uneventful. So much so that I stopped twice and read other books before finally finishing. For Sue Grafton fans who intend on completing the alphabet, you will need to read it but don't rush out for the hardcover!"
2,My least favorite from A to O,"I have enjoyed all of Sue Grafton's books from A to N, and this is the first one I didn't think was very good. It just didn't grab my attention. For the first time I had trouble finishing one of her books. Not bad; just not up to par."
5,Kinsey's Deep Dark Secrets,"In O is for Outlaw, Sue Grafton allows her Santa Teresa private eye, Kinsey Millhone, to explore a mystery from her personal past. A letter is discovered that exposes some facts concerning Kinsey's seldom mentioned first husband. Murder? Foul play? These are not questions Kinsey can pass up investigating. Along the way, her readers learn details from that first marriage as well as other personal secrets involving the death of her parents and her unique family environment. As always, Grafton captures her setting perfectly. Kinsey is in top form. The plot runs fast. The dialog reads true. O is for Outlaw is one of my favorite Grafton books. I'm looking foward to Z."
5,Oh-Oh-Oh!,"Sue Grafton just keeps spelling out winner after winner and ""O is for Outlaw"" proves that to her avid fans.""O"" gives us glimpses into Kinsey past while drawing us into the midst of another great mystery. Grab a copy today, you won't be disappointed.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
2,Disappointing!,I've really come to enjoy Sue Grafton's mystery series. But this one was a big disappointment! I felt like it kept repeating the same information over and over. Usually I love to buy hardback copies; this is one time I shouldn't have wasted my money.
3,"""O"" is for Ordinary","I have read all the alphabet books, and even though this is not the worst, it is not the best either.I liked the incite into Kinsey's past, but I felt it was long and drawn out and the fact she did not get to square things with her first husband was very unsatisfying."
1,"""O"" should be ""NO""","I have been a Kinsey fan for many years even though she seems to be getting more and more immature. This book brings out her worst...not only is she so unpleasant to everyone it is embarrasing, she is given the unbelievable talent of being able to elicit information by being particularly annoying. The story doesn't seem to really ""grab"" one's attention as the previous books in this series did. It was a struggle to the finish."
5,The Best One Yet,"Sue Grafton outdid herself in this one. The glimpse into Kinsey's past has been something her fans have long awaited. I read this book in two sittings and the end was bittersweet; it left me teary eyed. I won't reveal the ending, I just want to say that I wish Mick could have known. I think he deserved that much."
4,"Welcome back, Kinsey","I admit it -- I'm an unabashed fan of this series. That said, I liked this installment even better than ""N."" The character development that makes this series so good is here, of course. But this one also features a highly original plot. I was surprised by the climax and unexpectedly moved by the ending."
2,New reader for audio version is disappointing,"I've listened to the audio versions of the whole series to this point. This one and later have a different reader than the earlier ones. Usually in a series that is a surprise at first but you get used to it if it's a good choice. But this reader has a horrible raspy voice that is not only unpleasant to listen to, but creates a completely different (and less appealing) image of Kinsey in your mind. It's bad enough I'm losing interest in listening to the rest of the series."
4,Best in a long while,"I was captivated when I ""discovered"" Kinsey Milhone at the beginning of the alphabet, but by the time ""H"" rolled around, somehow the zing of the first seven novels was gone. "" ""O"" is for Outlaw"" recaptures the spirit that has been missing for much too long."
1,No plot and lots of padding,"This is the first Sue Grafton book that I have read and it will be the last. I picked it up hoping for a light and entertaining holiday read. Well it is certainly on the light side. It starts off okay but the plot never develops beyond the obvious. To make up for this the author frequently describes in minute detail the surroundings. This generally has nothing to do with the either the plot or the characterisation, and I was often left wondering just what a particular passage had to do with the story. As a comparison, novels by Dick Francis are both far more entertaining and informative."
2,Arlene B. Waite,"Too much time spent on changing clothes, taking a jog, eating poorly and jumping in the VW. It appears that writers are so pushed for deadlines that their writing becomes rather mundane. I have read all the alphabet books but will have to look over ""P"" before buying."
2,Hard to finish,"I've tried for several weeks now to read this book, but it is just boring. It had a lot of potential w/ it being about Mickey, hubby #1, but it became so bogged down w/ trivial stuff and no action that I fell asleep nearly every night reading it. I do like Dietz and Robb is O.K. (stupid, but O.K.) It'd be nice to see her really work on a case w/ one of them again, instead of calling them, or thinking a quick thought about them.I've enjoyed about 60% of the others, with G being my favorite, but I really don't care a whole lot about Kinsey. She's becoming even more bitter and nasty. I'd like to see some growth on her part. I've heard P's not any better. But, I'll give it a try. 26 books are an awful lot about one person, but perhaps Kinsey will find happiness."
5,O is for Outlaw,I have enjoyed all of the Kinsey Millhone series! She always gets herself in a dangerous position in the end and you can't put the book down.
4,I enjoyed this book as I have all of the books in the series,I love Sue Grafton's writing style. Her books are always so much fun to read and her characters are always a treat. I liked O is for Outlaw except for the end. I thought that it made no sense for Kinsey not to stop and enlist the aid of the police detectives instead of driving right by them. That little detail ruined the ending for me. Other than that I really enjoyed this book.
5,This is perfect to hang on the bike.,Bought this as a gift and he loves it. This is perfect to hang on the bike.great stocking stuffer
5,Motorcycle rider protector,St. Christopher is a great protector of driver's of any type of vehicle. My son-in-law is a motorcylist most of the time.
2,Decent,It isn't made to hang on bike as stated. Good for a key chain though. Or charm. It's not a gaurdien bells like they make you think
4,Wonderful,I purchased this item for a friend and it was a great hit. She loves it. She is a Harley rider and this is the perfect gift.
4,nice,For the price this is rather nice. I hooked it to my Harley jacket and I really enjoy having it there with me whenever I ride.
3,"""Ride with Me""................","Shipping was Quick. I'm a little disappointed; BUT: You get what You Pay for. They will still be given as Christmas Gifts...as both people Ride motorcycles. My disappointment is in the Detail. The picture shows details in the medal; but when I received them....the details were ""Not"" so clear. Also, the medal is attached to a card and it looks like when you pull them off the card; some residue will be left on the medal."
5,Thanks St Christopher and St Paul Harley Davidson,"This product arrived fast and looks great on my bike. For a key chain, this is a quality piece of metal and is almost as thick as the thickness of two quarters. Just be careful where you place the item. I originally had it on my motorcycle key ring. When I would drive the metal would flap in the wind and ended up scratching the area around the ignition. Now I placed it on my motorcycle in an area where it can't rub against anything. It would make a nice stocking stuffer for your motorcycle enthusiast."
1,And you'll sleep through this movie!,"After seeing Croupier, a previous collaboration between director Mike Hodges and actor Clive Owen, I was really looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is simply a bad movie. Where to start- how about the homophobic undercurrent prevalent throughout the movie? According to this movie, the worse fate in the world is to be raped and the only logical answer is suicide. This movie is so rote and by-the-book, with absolutely no suspense or build up, that it felt like I was watching a graduate student film. Clive Owen, usually a fantastic actor, possibly does TOO GOOD a job during this movie, underacting to the point of practically sleepwalking through the part; Charlotte Rampling is wasted in her role while Malcolm McDowell ACTS as if he were wasted (on booze, that is). I can't believe the same guy that made Croupier made this mess."
2,not worth your time unless you need to see every Clive Owen film,"A movie about grieving and revenge that starts out a bit odd, has a shocking moment, and then pewters out. It's worth a look for shaggybeard!Clive Owen and then cleaned-up!Clive Owen."
3,It almost made it,"How much cooler can yo get than Clive Owen as Will, the lonely ganster who leaves retirement to avenge his brother death. Charlotte Rampling, his estranged girlfriend, is the perfect vixen of a serie noir: beautiful, misterious, with far away eyes that hide and ambiguous soul. Even the tempo is right: slow, dark, heavy. And the villain, Malcom Mc Dowell, a twisted family man, how can he go wrong. So I was having the time of my life wondering why movies don't get so dark anymore when suddenly, the film sank, lost his tempo, and Will coolness vanished even thought he became handsomer with his new suit and haircut. It was like if at the end the producers, the director and the screen writer decided that the movie had to be hurried away making one of the lamest motives for a crime, sacrificing the first three quartes of what could had been a great movie"
1,What a waste of great talent!,"Great British actors such as Owen, Myers, Rampling and Mcdowell are waisted in this boring, lifeless film which could very well have been made as a TV movie. Could this really be directed by the same guy who made Croupier and Get Carter? A complete waste of talent, and one I think Clive Owen will want to forget, especially as he seems on the cusp of conquering hollywood."
3,"MIKE HODGES, OPUS 9",**1/2 2003. Directed by British born director Mike Hodges. A former mob boss comes back to London when his brother commits suicide. Nothing new under the sun even if there are some great actors involved. Already forgotten.
1,A Big Fat Stinker!,"I want the 103 minutes of my life back that I spent watching this movie. Deceived by the glowing reviews on the DVD jacket, I stuck it out until the end, hoping something interesting would happen. Nothing did. Even the actors looked bored."
2,Owen keeps this sleeper from going down in the garbage,"Clive Owen (Croupier, Closer, King Arthur) stars as William Graham, a former gangster, who returns to his friends, family and loved ones after 3 years absence. Owen also returns because his brother Davey Graham, played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Elvis, Alexander, The Maker), took his own life. Owen finds out that his brother was raped and he bled internally so that's why he killed himself. Owen, then sets out to avenge his brothers death. Clive Owen is always good in anything he is. If the movie is crappy, he's the only good thing in it. This movie is a sleeper which is really disappointing, I had high hopes for this one and the end kind of left me wanting more. It was a distasteful ending. Also starring Charlotte Rampling (Angel Heart, Swimming Pool) and Malclom McDowell (A Clock Work Orange, Pact With The Devil). McDowell is wasted in another short role."
2,"It had potential, but fell far short of it.","I had high hopes for this film, but came away from the ending credits feeling unsatisfied. At times the pace was very slow and the momentum of the movie was lost in scenes that failed to propel the story forward. For a gangster film, there was very little violence or action. The journey that the main character goes through helps build the tension of the film towards the anticipated climax. Unfortunately, what we end up seeing falls short. Instead, I was left feeling confused and denied a sense of completion. The story was not told fully. It was like a whole chapter of the book was torn out and we are left with having to make up the ending ourselves."
5,Required reading!,"This book is essential for anybody who wants to understand what Ptolemy, Copernicus and Kepler really did. It's a bit more technical than ""The Great Copernicus Chase"", but if you're serious, you'll appreciate it.And if you're really serious, you'll get a copy of the paper by James Evans in Am. J. Phys 56 (Nov, 1988) 1009-1024. It answered tons of technical questions for me. Just do it, you'll thank me (and Jim Evans!)."
5,Americans have fantasies too,"When one thinks of the fantasy genre one usually pictures the well worn paths of dragons, sword and sorcerer, medievil speak, etc. There is an overwhelming sense of Tolkien wannabe (See Eragon). As an American it is refreshing to read a fantasy not limited by that mind set. The story line is a classic child on a quest, but the language, imagination, landscape, imagery, and beauty of thought behind Raven Mocker makes it an outstanding read."
5,Perfect for toy puppy,"I bought several of the ""Mini"" toys for my 12 week old toy puppy. He loves them and they have stood up very well."
5,Puppy's Favorite Toy,My little Shipoo puppy simply loves this toy as well as other products by PetStages. I have bought multiples just in case one were to get lost while traveling. Great stuff PetStages! Amd the service from Little River Pet Shoppe was fantastic! Thank you
5,Add me to the WOW list,I ran across this by accident and gave it a listen. WOW!!! The interview is interesting and give great context to the music. I really enjoyed listening to this in this particular format. This recording showcases the phenomenal talents of both McParland/Costello.I'm going to recommend this to a couple friends straight away.
4,Elbow sleeve,"Works well, can get warm if worn for long periods of time. It does what it is intended to do"
3,Great performance but lightweight materials used.,"First, I ordered a large, I am 6'0, 167lbs with a 12"" elbow and it was too big. I returned it for a medium which fit great. I have chronic tendinitis above and below my elbow. The material worked great to reduce the pain and the band adds extra support. My biggest concern is the lightweight material and construction of the product. I don't expect much durability since it is already starting to unravel at the bottom of the sleeve near the stitching after wearing it 3 times. I have had to cut the raveled portion off for a ""cleaner"" look and feel. I may return this as defective and try one more, otherwise will go with another neoprene sleeve here on Amazon that appears to be of higher quality by Mueller."
1,Awful,"This was tight in all the wrong spaces, not supportive at all. Waste of money, wish I had returned it"
3,Good not Great,"While these performances evince no trace of Hogwoodism - thankfully - and Sinopoli keeps his own idiosyncracies in check, there is something missing here for all the excellence of the soloists, the orchestra and the sound engineers.It's called magic. As a commodity, it is never on tap. It can be evoked but its arrival or otherwise is never to be banked on.This is an enjoyable disc but once the music comes to an end, nothing resonates afterwards. Here, the Flute and Harp Concerto - in the last analysis - cannot quite match the vibrancy and sparkle of the Marriner performance from June 1972Flute Concerto / Flute & Harp Concerto. The Sinfonia Concertante lacks the poise and 'innigkeit' of the classic Bohm account from 1966Sinfonia Concertante K.297b & K.364.If you can pick up this disc cheaply, do so. But I would not go out of my way (again) to acquire it."
2,fun for parents but not as fun for kids,"I could totally relate to the underlying theme of this book so I bought it for our 4-year old because it sounded fun. While I can appreciate the humor, it doesn't keep his attention."
4,Lots of Fun for 1 year old,"This chicken is a lot of fun for a walking 1 year old. They have to drop the eggs in the back of the chicken and then she takes off laying the eggs behind her. It keeps them chasing after her. Our son thinks the eggs falling out is hilarious. Didn't give this product 5 stars because it seems a little pricy for what it is and she can only hold 2 eggs at a time so we have extra eggs rolling around that seem to go missing, but I guess that's why they give you 4."
4,No instructions and tips for use?,The product is excellent but it comes with no instructions for set up or any tips for use. Surprising and disappointing absence of literature. Would have rated this a five with the document(s).
3,hold fast,The hold fast works well. The plastic pad was broken in two when I opened the package. I decided to glue it back together with epoxy rather than returning it. So far it seems to be holding together.
3,Older performances - but still very listenable,"Older recordings, but a pleasant collection of big-band tunes by two outstanding artists. I have to admit that I bought this CD for one song (Are You Havin' Any Fun) - and that because of a commercial. That said, Count Basie and Tony Bennett don't disappoint."
5,GREAT food,"I have a cavalier who is an incredibly picky eater, and who has a skin condition that puts him on a limited ingredients diet. He goes BONKERS over this food. I've never seen him so excited to eat anything, ever. It looks like your stereotypical mushy, canned dog food, but if my dog's reaction stands for anything, then this might just be the best dog food ever."
4,Paul Horn in Kashmir and India,I was so happy to see the album re-released as a CD. I wore out my vinyl copy long ago as I used to love to play it on many mornings before going to work in the 60's and 70's. My only slight disappointment was that that the original Paul Horn in Kashmir recording got combined with Paul Horn in India for this recording - leaving out some of the original songs but I have to say that I still like the overall compilation. If you like N. Indian classical music and flute then this a good choice.
2,beware: great film . . bad edition,"It is generally agreed that this film is an extraordinary work of art. A stunning cast with Charlotte Rampling, Oliver Tobias, Fabio Testi, and Antonio Falsi all simply gorgeous. The sets are incredible and the vision is other-worldly. All the beauty, drama, and violence of the Carolinian theatre.But this edition is dreadful, and utterly misleading. It is not the uncut 106"" it promises, nor is it remastered. It is simply a bad copy of the horribly truncated 91"" American VHS aversion of this classic. I have made better DVD copies than this from my old VHS tape.There is a beautiful widescreen version from Asia, in Italian without subtitles in English. If you know the film and love it, you won't care. If you can find it, you will enjoy the feast for the eyes that was intended by the director.This version is only acceptable if you have never seen the film before and have no access to other, more difficult to find, editions."
1,In the 1 dollar bin at Walmart,"I'm just wondering why such a poor quality product is so expensive here. This edition of this fine film consists of a heavily censored version, that has been basically burned directly from a poor quality VHS tape, complete with tracking rolls and drop-out audio! I originally bought this edition from Walmart; for 1 dollar! After I eventually found and bought the beautiful Asian dvd for this title, I put this one where it belongs; in the garbage. I wouldn't sell it here because i would feel guilty, like I was ripping someone off! Unfortunately the sellers here don't seem to possess that kind of moral code. Buyers you have been warned..and sellers, good luck selling your crap at your inflated, laughable prices.."
4,Cool,I had to look up some more ivfo to use every in the box right and some of it I'll never use but it is cool to have.
4,Has everything pictured...,"This set included everything pictured. My only complaints are that it does not include a very large bottle of polish, and that the wooden box is splintering off on one of the edges, so I have to be really careful not to break off that piece."
2,Oil Bottle Issue,"Just what everyone was saying here, the oil bottle emptied into the box destroying the contents. I figured let me give it a shot and so I bought it for a friend for Xmas. I am glad I opened and checked it out before hand. This has been an issue with your stuff for like 2 years! Just open the box and tighten the cap for pete sake!! That is the only issue!! Other then oil soaked everything else was there."
3,Sword Cleaning Kit,"This cleaning kit arrived on time and well packed with no noticeable problems, however the item lists that it includes instructions and the kit I received had no instructions. Everything else was in order and in good condition.The picture is not a good example of how this kit looks just fyi."
4,Well done,"I took the risk after reading some of the reviews and hearing oil spilling everywhere. Looked at similar products too and saw the same problem. Though for me , no oil spilled ! Everything is just as described and intact. Should work well to maintain my blades. Great product , cant go wrong!"
3,Oil drained out of bottle!,"I've gotten a few cleaning kits from multiple places before, as I own 8 Katana, all together (3 Carbon Steel, the rest Stainless). And it was very upsetting that the first time I go to use this kit, the oil had drained out of the bottle, leaving everything soaked, and nothing in the small flask. The majority of the kit was already ruined before I even had a chance to use it. The clothes, oil, and the powder ball was drenched, while the only functioning thing was the brass hammer to take the studs out of the hilt.Would not recommend - but if you needed it, you may get lucky. Perhaps I was just given the short straw out of the bunch."
3,Inexpensive For Reason,I just started Iaido a few years ago and purchased a Paul Chen sword for cutting practice. I needed a cleaning kit so I found this one and ordered. The first one arrived but was missing the oil and a few other odds and ends so I sent it back and Amazon sent a new one. Great service from Amazon. The kit itself is just cheap and I would suggest you spend a few extra bucks and get a nice one with clove oil and the machine oil really smells. It is OK for my daily use cutting sword but not if you have an historical sword or better.
3,Good for the price,"Considering the price, I wasn't expecting much. And not much is what I got. My oil did leak a little, but it didn't ruin the other items, so it's alright. All the items were included and in tact otherwise. My main problem is I did not receive the instructions as was described, so now I have a kit with no idea how to use it. (I am a first timer on this thing.)It'll be alright once I look up instructions, but it is a bit of a pain.Also, the Kill Bill reference on the box is cute, if not a little cheesy.Overall a decent product but don't order it expecting anything amazing."
3,Sword Cleaner,"Very simple....INCLUDE INSTRUCTIONS!!!! I have various items in the kit and there is nothing that tells me what I need to do to clean the sword. Therefore, it has just sat on my shelf until I find out how to use everything. I am sure it is simple but it would only have taken a small piece of paper to explain what to do with all of the items."
3,Not thrilled,"The box was in fine condition but the oil container was completely empty. This means that fully 1/5 of the contents of the box is completely worthless. Guess, I'll have to provide the refill. I gave it three stars because of the price - I felt it was reasonable (although less so now in light of the missing oil), quick and secure shipping and the fact that the rest of the contents look to be in acceptable condition."
4,good,"The kit was alright. All of the things were included: the oil (except it was half empty), the hammer, rice paper, two pegs, and the powder ballThe box was splintered, but it was not that bad. It also arrived a couple days late, but that is not anything to be upset about."
3,Does not come with instructions as noted in description,"It arrived as promised but is missing the instructions, and did not include all the items as shown in the pictures. Being new to katana's I really needed the instructions. I'll have to resort to finding care instructions on the Internet."
1,No oil in the bottle.,"Oil was saturated on the directions... the lid was ovbiously not on tightly, thus having no oil in the bottle."
4,No pegs,"The Kit came fairly quickly (about 3 days). The description said it came with replacement pegs. it doesn't. The kit does does come with all the items listed in the instructions though, so I'd give this vender another chance"
2,Missing some stuff,"I personally did not like this very much, for one it did not come with the replacement pegs as stated and the box itself was not from even the stated manufacturer. The bottle of clove oil that came with it was leaking and had lost about 33% of its original volume, but everything else was fine. This product itself was alright, but be wary, you get what you pay for."
2,Need Instructions or Manual,"Ok maybe this is a stupid thing, but this kit don't include a manual or a simple instructions for clean your swords and katanas. Include differents elements but i really don't know how use it. For example, the hammer is for what?I was looking for information in the seller website and nothing there too.Just 2 stars for something elemental and basically like is a manual/instructions."
2,'sword' oil?,"kit includes everything as noted, however, be aware that the oil included in this kit is not choji oil but some amber liquid which seems like a light machine oil. i don't feel comfortable using the oil in this kit; also the mekuginuki seems poorly made (brass is unevenly polished but more importantly, it feels a bit loose and requires very regular tightening). if these two issues are not too important to your maintenance/cleaning, then this kit should be adequate."
3,decent,"this item is ok, the oil is decent and the hammer works well, but the cloths rip easily and the powder ball is made with baby powder which is useless for your swords but can also DAMAGE them youd be better off making your own kit"
1,Product not worth the money,"I was so disappointed in the item. As a gift for a japanese sword enthusiast, I thought this would be perfect. But when it was opened, the oil bottle (very cheap plastic) had leaked thoughout the box and onto everything. This rendered the whole thing worthless. I've learned my lesson, won't buy that again."
5,awesome,ahhh i love the maintenance and cleaning kit. My kitanas sparkle and with the oil i wont have to worry about rust. A definate must if you are going to be using or shapening your blades. It fits so well into the box. i loved it and would def recommend it.
3,everything is there except the pegs.,"Came in 2 days, nice fast AMAZON shipping. Sealed wooden box, so never opened.Powder, hamer, oil, cloth, but the pegs are missing.Still a great price if the rest works as expected."
3,sword Maintenance Cleaning Kit,"when I opened the kit, there was'nt any powder in the little jar. it was was just an empty plastic box & I didint see what you were supposed to get it from"
5,Useful,This product clearly had a lot of thought put into it. It has all of the pieces as advertised and each piece is sturdy and durable. The instructions are adequate for people who have never had to preserve a sword before. It includes a small plastic cylinder for storing the grease-filled rice paper to use more than once.
5,totally amazing,"i bought this kit and is actually pretty cool, easy to use and it made an amazing job, comes with instructions and is in a cool box, could not ask for more"
4,Awesomeness!,I ordered this for my brothers birthday gift and I am pleased on how fast it got here. It is in great condition and I am sure hes gonna love the gift! :)
5,underrated Chabrol ...,"This seems to me to be rather a wonderful film from the later part of Chabrol's oeuvre, and stands far above other films he made from that period for me. It is a very 'down' story about two alcoholics but the actresses in question - Marie Trintignant and Stephane Audran - are both so brilliant that the film takes on a greater stature than it would otherwise have, going beyond a genre piece based on a Simenon story to become something really moving. Audran is sublime in a way that makes you feel how underused she has been since the early days with Chabrol, her presence on screen is so compelling, and Trintignant captures the pathos and vulnerability of her character in a way that is totally heartbreaking."
2,Plastically impressive,"1/2 star for the cinematography, 1/2 star for the editing, and 1 star for the late Marie Trintignant.I am a fan of most films by director Claude Chabrol, but this was very disappointingly static to me, as Hollywoodian screenplays go (and this, French as it might be, is Hollywoodian cinema after all).Watch two girls talk, get laid and drink ridiculous quantities of liquor... And watch Stephane Audran sit and try to look sincere (or sincerely insincere) for a good portion of footage... Some other actors are pretty bad and uninvolved also...Masterful, but formally only. But Chabrol is very proud of it, so maybe this is ill-advised for you."
5,A great book by a wonderful photographer,Koudelka is an amazing photographer! Every young photographer must see these pictures.
3,can you say death metal!,"i bought ""anthems"" and ""in the nightside eclipse"" and i think they are great. but when i bought this i was expecting to have got my money's worth, HA, was i mistaken. emperor has definitly lost their touch. sure, the whole atmosphere may still be black metal, but the music is death metal, pure and simple. if you like black/death metal, buy it, but if you like more orchestrated black metal like emperor's previous US releases, don't waste your money. i did give it 3 stars because it is still much better than emperor's earliest recordings, but it fails to live up to ""anthems"""
3,"A good metal cd, but not Black Metal","If this were some other band's recording, I would say it was a good, solid extreme metal disc with good production. But, as far as I am concerned, Emperor died a long time ago. They are no longer Black Metal, and they have forsaken their roots. I If you enjoyed the ""Anthems"" disc, then buy this. I say get the new Marduk. Hail the true Metal of Death!!!!"
3,Just so-so,"Simply said you either like it a whole lot or hate it. I'm leaning to the latter. The orchestration that Emperor has always had is missing some ingredients that label this music pure black metal (referring to old-school black). The atmosphere is either non-existent or too choked up to offer any interest to me. Death and thrash metal are introduced into Emperor's compositional skills and take some getting used to for older fans. There's a lot of controversy over this album because people say they sold out but I still have some faith albeit not much. This album is more main-streamed IMO due to the incredible number of hooks and catchy riffs that aren't found in traditional black metal. Step down or a new foundation, Emperor's changed definitely. If you don't like the change then go buy some other CD, if you love this CD then you should look more into modern metal."
1,something about this one...,"I don't knw..This has everything a good album should have-hooks, speed, and dizzying fretboard masturbation- but something just doesn't click. There's not as much FEELING anymore...It's technically awe inspiring, but its just way to commercial and superficial sounding-Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with a band becoming popular on their merits, but when they sacrifice something for that popularity...it just irks me, is all---Same with Dimmu. Get Wrath of the Tyrant instead"
5,Easily the best metal album of 1999!,"Those who do not appreciate this album are forgetting what Emperor is all about in the first place. Yes, it is experimental, but that's great! Who wants the same album over and over? It's by no means commercial. Do yourself a favor if you don't have this get it and worship it. HAIL TO EMPEROR!"
3,Not as good...,"mmm...i dont know about this.Its a great metal album for sure,but all of the dark atmosphere that the former Emperor albums had,is gone.It is a bit too trash metal for me.Though there are still some very good parts on this disk,I rather listen to 'Nightside...'. A slight disappointment..."
5,GODS OF BLACK METAL!! But why did they drop???????,"I LOVE EMPEROR WITH A PASSION AND SNEAR UPON THOSE WHO DISS THEM!!!! But this album, I support everything of theirs I can, but somehow this album ended up not being so great. It is not as dark, not as hellish, and doesnt strike me as something to get all my emotions feeling evil as all their other albums. Why oh why Emperor did you lose the ORIGINAL style you had??? I must say Emperor is Original, no other band could EVER touch their point of being Gods of black metal. still, i love this album and all the rest and i still love the band Emperor!!!!!! AVES SATAN!!!! HARK O NIGHT SPIRIT!!!!"
4,Emperor's most accessible album? Yes. Emperor's best album?,"No. This is an excellent record, and I insist metal fans buy it. You don't have to be in to Black Metal to enjoy this one though. It is definetly not their best, but its not a huge step down the quality ladder from Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk. This is Emperor's best sing-along, toe-tapping album (niether of these things would be possible on their first (and best) release In The Nighside Eclipse). This is not a hard album to like, and I think its a good addition to anyone's metal collection."
1,horrible,"Emperor were once this great band that released mindblowing morbid albums like Wrath of the tyrant or in the nightside eclipse. What the ... happened? This is the half-... release that set them apart from what the once stood for. The agression present on past albums is gone. The songs are very lame and unmemorable. The overall producton just adds insult to injury. Whats more stupid is Ihsahn trying out to outdo King diamond with his female vocal aproach. While this fits within King's music, it just sounds absurd in emperor. I don't even want to check out their latest album because I know what to expect."
2,Very disappointing,"Shows the aggression of songs like ""The Loss and Curse of Reverence"" but does not contain their originality, and in addition ALL the songs seem to have this same aggressive nature without any more melodic tracks to balance the album. I've heard black metal which is by far worse than this, but coming from Emperor this album is very disappointing."
5,Beats anything Cradle of Filth ever did.....,"I bought this album before I really had time to appreciate Black Metal as a genre, but soon became aware that it (black metal) holds some of heavy metal's most textured and beatiful songs. Although this is not necessarily the darkest album, it is still black metal at its nadir, combining fast riffing and drumming with melodic interludes and keyboard arrangements that add to each song tremendously. Definately a good place for black metal neophytes!"
2,what happened....,"let me begin by stating that i am not a fan of emperor's earlier efforts, but i can appreciate what they and other black metal outfits were trying to do...but where are the harsh soundscapes? this album is far too clean. it is almost as if they were trying to bridge the gap between ""true"" and ""new"" black metal...unwilling to take a stance with either side, they decided that they would jump somewhere in the middle. the songs are not put together as well as they were hyped to be either. i guess that for those who are uninitiated to the sounds and stylings of the black metal elite, this is a good starting point. but for those with this knowledge, this is simply not going to be enough to fill them up...in other words, this is great for those with a bit of curiousity towards the phenomenon known as black metal, but for those fans of the genre(who already have this and for whom this serves no purpose) why waste the money....get another copy of ""anthems..."" ...."
4,Sadly Underrated,"Most fans of the band say this is Emperor's worst album, but I don't hear it. While it's certainly not as good as their first two albums its still excellent. ""Curse You All Men"" is their best opener and one of their best tracks. ""An Elegy of Icaros"", ""Nonus Equilibrium"", ""The Source of Icon E"" and the epic closer ""Of Blindness and Subsequent Seers"" are all excellent tracks. The only weak track is ""The Warriors of Modern Death"". Otherwise this album is great: great songs, great production, great musicianship. Highly recommended."
2,Expensive for what you get.,This product is very expensive for a cheaply made cribbage board. The only promising part is the chess board is very well made but still has a somewhat cheap feel to it. I wish the cribbage board wasn't so poorly made.
1,"Made in China, need we say more","Received this as a Christmas gift. Used very lightly in my office. Died after a few months of use. Simply won't turn on. I imagine the electronics fried in it from the heat. More likely, there is a chip in there that causes it to die shortly after the warranty is expired.It's another piece of junk made in China, now destined for a U.S. landfill.Don't waste your money on Lasko."
4,Kaplan LSAT Logic Games Workbook Review,"I bought the logic games workbook primarily for exercise purposes. It was quite helpful, although it lacked examples of some types of logic game questions. Overall, it served its purpose. The explanations are good and for beginners, it is an excellent resource."
1,worst lsat review ever,"the explanations are sooo awful, and the fake questions are not what would appear on the lsat. sometimes they leave some things out"
4,Securing pictures,"After visitng the Earthquake show at the California Academy of Sciences, I realized that I should secure my many paintings, some with glass. I ordered Quakehold fixtures from Amazon. They were very easy to install, and I secured 17 pictures in my house, and 4 in my friend's house. It is quite easy to remove the pictures from the Quakehold if necessary -- lift the picture wire up, in, up, out."
5,LIve in California?,If you live in California you need to buy these.When installed correctly they hold picture frames to the wall.In case of an earthquake they flip and flop but pictures don't fall which in insurance for less broken glass to step on in case of emergency. I think these are great and they are invisible behind the pictures.
5,MX vs ATV,"Ok,when i first got this game i was a little worried that it would be the same as the last one.It mostly is, exept for a few changes, they took out the yahmahas and the ktm,s (thos of you who have no clue about motocross, they took out the blue bikes and the orange ones)It also has one knew national and knew saind rails, and golf carts.The graphics were awsome for a handheld.Atv blazin trails doesent even compare to this game.This game is a must for people who like these kinds of games."
1,Very poorly made,"This glider chair is very poorly made we have had the base break three times since we bought it (less than a year ago) and the arms are now falling off. The customer service is excellent and the company had no problem sending us replacement parts, but seriously enough is enough. We used this glider for rocking our baby to sleep, every time it broke it would take us an extra hour or two to get the baby to sleep ... awesome. we are currently looking for a traditional rocker, which will hopefully last a little longer."
2,You Get What you pay for,"I bought this glider a couple of months before my daughter was born. I had read all of the reviews about the glider and decided to take a chance. I had read that it was squeaky and the padding became uncomfortable. I used it occasionally before she was born and liked it. When she was born I have used it almost everyday. After about 2 months, it started to squeaking in the back of the chair and I couldn't get comfortable because of the padding. I had to sit sideways to get comfortable and after about a half an hour, I had to readjust to get comfortable again. At about three months, I sat in the chair to put my little one to sleep, and the chair snapped! Luckily, we didn't fall to the floor, I caught us before we got there. My husband tried to fix it, but was unsuccessful, now my dad is trying to fix it, but does not think that it will glide anymore because the track is worn out (I didn't think I used it that much!) I guess you get what you pay for!"
1,horrible quality - had 2!,"I bought one of these and loved it initially. It was comfortable and smooth. But within 2-3 weeks, it started clicking and squeaking and then one of the bolts broke! I assume it was a one-of-a-kind defect, so I returned it and replaced it with the same exact one. And the second one is doing the same thing! In fact the bolt broke again so now I have to return the second one as well! I am very disappointed in this chair. Definitely do not recommend."
1,You get what you pay for,"We have had this chair for almost 2 years now. It was fine for the first year but now it is falling apart. I wish I had paid the extra money for a chair that would last. The arm keeps falling off, the bottom squeaks and creaks loudly when barely rocking, and the cushon has gotten really thin. We do not even use the chair that often. I wouldn't recommend this chair unless you only intend to use it for short time."
1,Very disappointed,"My husband and I were very surprised in the poor quality of this chair. We order frequently from Amazon and have always been pleased with the products they offer. We were looking for a mid-range priced glider and reasearched them pretty well. We decided on this storkcraft for the style and price. While it was very easy to assemble, the size of the back of the chair is extremely short. My head barely could rest on it, while my husbands head went above the back of the chair by a good 18 inches. The seat cushion is extremely uncomfortable, very thin, no padding at all. We gave the chair about 5 minutes before my husband disassembled it and we returned it. Thank goodness the assembly was not difficult or time consuming, and that Amazon is so amazing with their return policy. I would HIGHLY caution buyers against this chair. We're going to consider a used better quality one from Craigs list."
1,"Came stained and torn, also not very comfortable","When we received the product, the fabric of the ottoman was stained and torn, even though it was still wrapped in plastic. Obviously, Storkcraft simply upholstered the chair with damaged fabric. In addition, the seat is very thin and stiff, so not very comfortable, and the chair back angle is very straight, so you basically have to sit straight up in this chair. The seat back is also too low to rest your head on, so all in all it is not a very relaxing rocking experience. We ordered it because it was inexpensive, but I say that if you can afford to pay a little more, get a more comfortable one!!! And hopefully you can find a cleaner, un-ripped one, too."
1,it squeaks it sucks save your money,"my wife weighs 110 lbs and it squeaks really loud, it just sucks, customer service people sucked all around. It is a giant suck fest, don't buy this product, you will thank me!"
4,"For the price, it's very good","Being a new parent my wife was looking for a glider. Went to babies r us and their chairs were gong for 300-500. I decided to check on amazon and found this chair with fairly good reviews. For the price I would recommend this. One knock on this chair would be that I did find the cushion to be uncomfortable after sitting on it for more than 20 minutes. But like I said, for the price I can deal with it."
5,Comfy,"This rocking chair is beautiful, sturdy and assembled quickly. The sides of the arms have pockets which I am using to put burping cloths and blankets. Better than I expected for sure!"
5,very comfort chair,I bought this chair set when I was pregnant. I find it is very comfort for a pregnant woman and a breast-feeding mom.
3,better cushion material would have been a higher rating,"Ordered through amazon and received it quickly. The product seems to be well built, not yet using actively. But I must say I was disappointed with the cushion material and outside cloth. I spent $129 for this. I saw better products on sale for similar price that has micro-fiber cloth and thicker cushion than this one."
2,horrible squeaking!,"My son in 25 months and this glider was great up until a few months ago. The quality isn't the best, but it was a good price and it fit well in the nursery. Unlike many of the customers whose reviews I've seen here, the wood was not cracked or anything, but here is my big gripe: IT WON'T STOP SQUEAKING!!!! We tried oiling it, adjusting the tightness of the screws, you name it. Anything we tried would only make it stop squeaking for a couple minutes and then it would start squeaking again. At first, I could adjust my weight and position and stop the squeaking, but now the darn thing won't stop no matter what I do. THE SQUEAKING IS GETTING LOUDER too. I am ready to throw this thing out the window and set it on fire!"
2,Squeak and came scratched,"Title of review says it all. Everyone said well u get what you pay for ! It squeaks and came scratched pretty badly. Thought maybe it was a reject, but no. You get what u pay for. Too lazy to return it and complain. Too busy with my newborn baby!"
3,Just okay...,"This glider didn't take a long time to assemble. The material of the cushion is quite cheap and it became flat so fast (we have been using it 2 months now) and neither my husband or I are heavy people. The cover of the cushions is also becoming quite noisy, which makes me worry about waking my baby up while trying to put her to sleep. The wood portions are okay so far, but I feel like I am waiting for it to fall apart on me soon. I cannot rest my head on the back at all unless I really lower my body into the seat (I would have had to buy the glider with the longer back). I am beginning to hear some squeaking when I rock in it but I have not examined it yet to see what the issue is. I would be very very surprised if this glider lasted for my next baby...or even the next few months."
3,its ok,The glider is ok. It was very easy to put together and the color is true to the website but you are getting what you pay for. It is a cheap glider and its cheaply made. The cushions over the armrest just snap on and they continue to come undone. The cushion is a little scratchy against bare skin. It works though...
5,Had it for almost a year now,"I bought this for my wife for rocking the born baby. We (she mostly) have been using the chair in the babies room for almost a year. It is very comfortable and the pockets on the side are great for storing magazines, remote controls etc. It took about five minutes to assemble, very simple. I picked it mostly for price but have been very please with the quality and comfort."
1,Horrible chair!!!,My husband and I ordered this chair to rock our newborn son in. We have had it a week and already had three springs break and a button pop off. My husband almost took a hammer and destroyed the chair after the last spring popped and almost broke his finger. Neither me or my husband are over 115-120 pounds so weight was not an issue. I am very upset with our purchase and feel that our son's safety was in danger. I am returning the chair and would not recommend this product to anyone!
5,Great buy!,I bought this for my daughter who was expecting her first baby. The baby came 3 weeks early so at this time she has had an opportunity to try out the chair. She is very pleased. I did give it a try before the baby was born and found it pretty comfy. I actually considered ordering one for myself just for relaxing. I strongly considered buying one of the expensive ones but found it hard to justify when all of the reviews for this one was really good. I was told that it was easy to put together and I found the shipping time really incredible. It was delivered within about 2 days. I certainly hope that the chair holds up over time as that was my biggest concerns.
4,Here's a How To Video I Made About this Chair,Length:: 0:35 MinsHow to Put Together a Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman Set - A Mostly Useless Time Lapse Video.
2,Will do for now,Very nice appearance and color matches perfectly. However padding is less than adequate for something you'll be sitting on for hours. We were also missing a brad for the side pocket.
2,It might do the job,"We debated over going with an expensive glider or a cheaper one. We settled on the cheaper one. It arrived today and was easy for me to assemble. It is very small in scale - I am 5'7"" and my head is above the back rest. The back cushion is pretty comfortable, but not the seat cushion. I already stuck another cushion on top of it, which raises me up even higher. I haven't used it yet with an infant, as we are not due for another few months, but I think it will do the job. If you are hesitant, I would definitely recommend going with a higher quality glider."
1,"Chair seems to be good, but got wrong arm-rest","Length:: 0:23 MinsThe package has wrong set of arm rests, the right arm rest is out of size and seems to be bigger than the left one (which is correct size and fits the base). I dont find a way to get the correct arm-rest, please guide for the same."
2,Glider Just Not Comfortable,"I requested this glider in my registry and someone bought it for me. I had read the reviews and it seemed like a good deal. Let me tell you, after sitting many hours in this chair..it is just not comfortable. The cushions are just too small and thin to sit on for very long. I cannot find a thicker cushion to fit it either. Using a foam pillow under the cushion right now. Also, the seat cushion started coming apart at the seam in just 1 month of use. The ties that tie the back cushion to the frame ripped out in 2 months of use. The wood finish scratches easily. And it is just plain small. All in all I desperately wish I had opted for a more expensive chair that is bigger in size, more comfortable, and better built."
4,Good chair for the price,"We bought this glider & ottoman for our nursery & haven't been disappointed. Assembly was relatively straightforward, and it hasn't started squeaking in the 6 months we've used it. A good chair for nursing & baby care."
3,comfortable but the cushion is too thin,"generally good. not difficult to assemble, but there are some problems with the accessories, e.g. the frame may not be strict rectangular, etc. It's comfortable, but the cushion is too thin and not very soft."
4,Great chair for price,Great chair for the awesome price. Holds good weight too. Wish the cushione were dark for keeping clean appearance but still love it.
3,Great chair...but not forever.,"One of the baseboards craked in half about 8 months after using this glider. I was able to fix it by screwing a piece of scrap wood onto it, but it doesn't look nice anymore. You get what you pay for."
4,"Eye pleasing, could be more comfy","Compared to similar gliders, this was a fantastic value. Paying roughly $160 with shipping included is a deal that really can't be beat. However, with such a great price comes sacrifice and in this case it's comfort. The chair looks very pretty and was assembled in less than 20 minutes, so I was very happy with that. The bummer is that the cushion is on the hard side like most reviewers stated. The glider works perfectly, is quiet, and aesthetically pleasing, so I'll suck it up and buy an extra pad to sit on. Hopefully that will make it a 5 star product."
3,The Cusion Material not so great and it doesn't swing freely,The Cusion Material not so great and it doesn't swing freely. I found better ones for same price at walmart.
4,donny327,"Very good, but could be a little deeper for normal adult. Would also have preferred a different color."
4,Easy to assemble!,This glider/ottoman is a great value and very easy to put together. The fabric is also soft and cozy.
2,Broke after 6 weeks,We bought this glider before our son was born. It was as described - we liked the pockets on the side so we could have things handy during feeding. We were happy with the glider at first. Unfortunately the base broke 6 weeks into using it. I leaned down to grab something off the floor and it broke on one side of the base - there really isn't a way to fix it because the wood is cracked. I only weigh 150 so I can't imagine that weight had anything to do with it.
4,Easy to assemble & comfortable to use...I like it,This set is easy to assemble and comfortable to use. I like it because it does not make a noise when it glides and the cushion on the chair on ottoman is comfortable. The covers on the handle are good and the back rest is comfortable as well. The wood on this set is also high-quality and cleanly cut. The chair is not heavy to lift or move. I would recommend this set to anyone & everyone.
5,Good for the price!,A bit narrow for putting a buppy for breastfeeding but I enjoy it still. I push the buppy around my waist and enjoy the rocky part of both pieces.
3,nice piece,"This is a nice rocking chair ... it is comfortable, the cushions are soft and easy to sit on for quite sometime ... i like the side pockets on the covering of the handles of the chair ... the ottoman is just at the right height for me ... all in all, a good buy ..."
4,Baby's Room,"The product is exactly as the picture depicts it. It is comfortable to sit in and it has a smooth gliding action. The price (we paid $129.00 shipping incl) was very reasonable considering that there are many comparable gliders available online for 2 and 3 times the price. Assembly was easy. We had it together in 15 minutes. It has roomy pockets built into each of the arm rests that are adequate for a book, magazines, baby rattle, baby bottle, bible, etc.The only point of disappointment is that product is made in China... but then so is most everything these days."
5,Pretty good,"After reading a lot of review, I decided to purchase this item and was not disappointed. Putting it together was really easy. Ottoman came pre-assembled. The only assembly needed was the back and the two arm-rests. A total of 6 screws. Got it done in under 10 minutes. The material itself is of decent quality. I know it won't last 10 years but for the price I don't expect it to. One thing I really liked about this, at least for now, is how quiet it is. It does not make any noise when you rock.The only con, if you want to call it, I can think of is that the back of the chair is not that high. Picture is a bit deceiving. If you are taller than 6' it might be an issue."
3,Worth for the price,"I recently bought this for my wife, since we have a new born we thought it would be helpful for soothing the baby. Product was worth for the given price.I dont recommand this to people who is annoyed with squeeking sound. Whenever we rock on this it makes annoying squeeking sound which obviously disturbed our baby and us.If no sound you are lucky!"
2,Missing part delivered :(,"The glider is good but there was missing button for the side pocket making it unable to assemble correctly like on the other side. Unfortunately, I shipped this product oversea already so couldn't return it :("
2,I Give Up!,"This thing is cheap and flimsy. The cushions are thin and unsupportive. The build is insubstantial and rickity. Small children are guaranteed to get pinched or worse with the lack of protection on the the rocking mechanisms in both the chair and ottoman. My most valued input is from other reviewers but I guess that's not going to work anymore.....ahhhh, the photo makes it look like you really did good!What makes me think I can get a quality product at a rock bottom price? Better rethink that too. I bought this for my daughter-in-law and feel embarrassed about what I gifted her.What is up with all these high markings?"
4,Hope I get the rebate!,"This is one great glider rocker, smooth and comfy perfect for that nersury my daughter set up.I hope I get the $10.00 difference since I ordered it just last Monday and it shipped Thursday. Pray Pray Pray"
3,So far so good!,Baby isn't here yet so I am not sure how comfy it will be when he arrives. As far as me sitting in it by myself its pretty comfy and I think it will do just what I need it to do.
5,Nice chairs,"I bought 2 of these chairs for my small family room. Easy to assemble, took about 5 minutes per chair. True colors. These chairs are great for the money."
2,Cracked Frame in original AND replacement,"For the 2 times I was able to use this glider, it was comfy and smooth. Then the frame cracked. Amazon quickly and easily replaced the glider. When I opened the box of the replacement, the frame was cracked in the same exact spot!"
3,smaller Than expected,"I wish the chair is bit bigger than shown in the image,I went to another retail store and plannign to purchase a differt kind of the same chair."
5,Go To Your Corner!,"I bought this glider to create a reading nook in our newly remodeled den. It's perfect! It arrived very quickly and we had it put together in about 15 minutes. It's just the right size for placing in a corner. Even with the ottoman, it doesn't stick out too far or encroach upon the rest of the room. The chair and ottoman glide smoothly and effortlessly. With several different styles, (square back vs. rounded back), and color combinations to choose from, you're sure to find one that fits your motif. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one in the future. I wish I had had one of these back during my baby making days!~ jade ~"
4,Just great!,"Granted, this isn't quite as comfy as the super expensive ones they sell in BRU - but this will work, and it is rather comfy. I'm not sure why so many people complain about the cushion - it feels just fine to me. Maybe they changed it? Assembly was a breeze. As others have said, 8 bolts/screws. Took me about 15 minutes by myself at 35 weeks pregnant! Looks great in my daughter's bedroom with her other Cherry furniture. Beautiful chair, and will work great for sitting in her room to read her bedtime stories, and to nurse her little brother when he arrives while keeping an eye on her at the same time.Very much satisfied with this purchase."
4,Good item for it's price!,I purchased this item before my baby boy arrived. I sat on it several times and enjoyed the comfort. It was a reasonable price compare to other places.
4,Super Chair,This chair is pretty great. It was very easy and fast to put together. It is a very comfortable chair and glides awesome. No problems with noise from the chair at all. The only problem is the ottoman is not made to hold any weight so dont sit on it. Other than that it is a great purchase and would highly recommend it.
4,For the price,"Like every other review, this chair is a bit on the small side.But, for the price, this was the perfect choice.It was easy to assemble, packed well.It arrived a lot faster than I thought it would.Some folks purchase the really expensive gliders and then hide them away in the nursery and then get rid of them.I can't see spending $500 on something like that. This glider was about $150 if I remember correctly. That is a great price for a new product."
2,Storkcraft glider,"The chair came fast, but found the same one at Walmart the next day for 20 dollars cheaper. And this one came with scratches and the wrong color."
3,Not the best built,"Not bad for the money however the quality is not great. The wood is not very strong and feels a little cheap. If I was to buy again I would probably spend the extra $$$ and get a solid wooden chair.It is comfortable and looks great, so if you are not wanting to spend a lot it's great!!"
3,Comfy,"I ordered this glider on the 10th recieved it on the 20th. Fast assemble work, of course the hubby assembled it. Kids loves it especially the ottoman. As i sat on it and rocked on it for a few times I started to hear a creaky noise. I was like...oh no it can't be...maybe this thing can't handle my heavy pregnacy weight. I guess we will have to see after baby is born. I like it, its comfy. Good choice for the price, probably will have to invest in some new, more thick cushions later on. But all in all i like!"
5,Wonderful chair!,I love love love this chair! It was so easy to put together and the color matched our crib/changing table perfectly. The arms have pockets which we've put burp rags and blankets in for easy access while feeding the baby. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for glider.
3,Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman Set,"I bought this for my wife since she has become pregnant, she loves it but for sitting too long she gets a back ache!The material is okay. But for the price, it is a good buy, cannot complain."
5,Would recommend,"The chair and ottoman was just as advertised. Timely delivery, in accetable condition. Very easy to assemble. This was a gift for my daughter and her husband at their baby shower. She loves it."
4,It serves it's purpose,"I bought this a week before my 3 month old was born (tried it out at Target first, then found it here for cheaper and qualified for free shipping!) Easy to put together, although stretching the arm cushions took 2 of us.The first month my baby hated it, we used the yoga ball more.Now we use it all the time (think 6-8 times a day for 5-10 minutes each time).2 Complaints:As others have stated, the back cushion does not completely cover the top back of the chair as pictured. However, a rolled up hand towel fixed that (and when you are an exhausted first time parent, does it really matter? Just nice to sit down for once!)It started making a clicking sound about a month ago (2 months after purchasing) when rocking. I have not had my husband try to fix it, but just an FYI it is there. Not super loud to wake the baby, but it's there.Otherwise, great investment, can't wait to sit in it and read books to baby when he is older!"
1,DO NOT BUY.,"I purchased this glider a month before my son was born and it didn't last past his 2 month birthday. It was a little uncomfortable to sit in anyway but the bottom screws snapped off on one side. My husband repaired it with new screws and some wood glue rather than go through the hassle of shipping it back. That worked great until it broke in two other places a week later. It is a cheap glider so your getting what you pay for. DON'T buy this item, spend a little more on another brand."
1,Less than one month,We purchased this chair and ottoman because we have a new baby. This chair was great at first but less than 1 month after we purchased it the chairs glider broke. (Neither my husband or I are over weight so that was not the issue) I really had great hopes for this chair because our new baby girl really seemed to like it and it was pretty comfortable but I am not happy that the chair lasted less than 30 days. If I had purchased it locally I would have returned the chair or at least gotten a replacement.
1,Smells Like Kerosene,"The seat smells of Kerosene. I figured it might need some ""airing"" and kept it in the patio for 2 days now. The smell is persistent and wont go away."
1,Fell Apart In 3 Weeks,"Do not waste your money on this glider. I registered for this glider/ottoman and received it as a baby gift. I definitely would have chose differently, however, if I had known it would fall apart. One of the springs broke before we even had it set up for three weeks. Unfortunately, by the time it had been given to us and by the time we set it up, it was too late to return it. Once my husband fixed the spring, another one broke. Eventually he reinforced all of four of them and it seems to work ok now. This glider/ottoman did not perform as I had expected, and did not live up to my expectations. A couple pros though: it is lightweight and easy to move and the side pockets are very handy."
1,EDIT: UNSAFE PRODUCT,"(EDIT) After one year:It falls apart. Unsafe and should be recalled. Bolts won't stay together, springs under bum cushion always pop out while using it. Noisy and can cause an injury."
3,It's just OK- you get what you pay for...,"For the price, this set isn't bad. It's fairly comfortable and easy to put together, but there are a few areas for improvement with the design. First, the edges of the armrests are hard, wood corners which should be covered with something soft but aren't. When my baby moves and brushes against his head against the wood edge, he'll often wake himself up or cry. I try to put a blanket under his head to avoid that, but it'd be a lot easier if the chair were covered to begin with. Second, this chair often squeeks- we're not very large, so I'm not sure why it squeeks but does every other time we use it- it can be kind of loud and annoying if you're trying to rock a little one to sleep. Third, the bolt on the bottom front of the rocker keeps loosening with the rocking motion and falls off. NOT COOL!!! I screw it back on but find a few weeks later it's back on the floor.This is not a chair for long-term use, but it does the job if you need a rocker on the cheap."
1,complete waste of money,"The pre-assembled part of this chair falls apart regularly, sending me looking for the nuts and washers so I can put it back together. The fabric is absorbent cotton so, if you're actually getting this to rock a baby, it will quickly acquire an interesting ""pattern"" due to spit up and the like. This chair was cheap, but the fact is that it's really worthless. Complete waste."
4,Nice sturdy chair,"This glider set is a pretty cherry wood color. There are only 3 pieces to screw together. It took about 1/2 hour for one person to assemble and the instructions are easy to follow. The right arm seems a little off, but still fits. Would definitely recommend."
5,POPPY,GREAT BABY SHOWER GIFT AND ITS GOOD FOR THE MOTHER WHEN SHE DELIVERS HER CHILD TO STAY OFF HER FEET.
2,"1 star for poor quality, 5 stars for great amazon customer service","After less than one month of using this chair lightly, it broke. One of the springs on the seat popped out and after i managed to get it back into it's place, about a week later the ball bearings piece broke while my wife was nursing our son, causing them to fall out of the chair (luckily neither of them was hurt). She is only 5'5 and 120 lbs so it's not like she is putting a whole lot of stress on the chair - this chair is very poor quality. Amazon customer service is great and they helped us get a replacement chair quickly. We'll see how the second one holds up."
1,disappointed,Don't do it! Its cheaply made. I had my chair for almost a month and the wood is splitting I only used it during my baby shower. Literally chunks of wood broke off from the chair.
4,Stork Craft Glider,"I bought this as a shower gift and my daughter loved the chair. Since she has Stork Craft furniture for her baby's room, it matched perfectly. Very easy to put together and a great price."
4,It is very good for backpain,It is very good for back pain and gives much better relief. My wife is pregnant and she likes to spend most of time on it. It gives her a lots of relax and comfort. Rocking chair with Ottoman is must!! It does both work of giving relax to back and your leg.
5,Love this glider!,We just got this delivered and put it together the other day. Very easy assembly. The chair is lovely as is the matching ottoman. It is so comfy too! Highly recommend!
2,Don't Waste Your Money,I ordered this glider before my son was born because it was inexpensive and had good reviews. It is nice looking chair but not very comfortable. The material seems cheap and the bottom cushion lost its shape very quickly. It is also uncomfortable to sit in for a long period of time and I had a hard time sleeping in it. My biggest complaint is that the spring in the chair broke three times. I am petite and not much weight was put on it. We ended up returning it and getting our money back.
3,okay,"Well the very first time I sat on it, one of the springs completely broke.It made a really loud popping sound which scared me, and I found it very insulting because I weigh 120. Fortunately, none of the other springs have broken, even with my husband sitting in it, who weighs around 170 I think. Now we've had it for about a year with no other problems. It is very comfortable and looks great in the nursery. The only aesthetic problem is, where the spring is missing, the seat cushion sags and it looks really weird and bad, but I remedied this by simply keeping my daughter's teddy bear on that spot and you can't even tell. If it weren't for the faulty spring I would have given it five stars."
3,Good chair..cheap fabric,"I use this chair at least 4 times a day and have for 7 months. The glider itself has held up very well. Unfortunately though, the fabric is unbelievably cheap. Anytime I get any kind of stain on it (mostly spit up or formula), I'll try to wash it out with water or soap and water and yet it always leaves a hideous stain once it dries. Needless to say my entire chair looks pretty stained at this point. Also, when you first open the cushions, you have to squirt them with Febreeze because the smell is awful. It goes away though."
4,Glider Rocker by Stork Craft from Amazon.com,"Great value for the price paid. No sqeaks or groans when rocking. Comfortable and attractive. I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone over 250 lbs. The stability of the chair lessens with heavy weight in it (I only know this because my daughter tried to sit on my lap while I was in the chair, and together we weigh about that). But all in all a GREAT product!"
3,great chair but came out with a defect,"When the glider was easily put together it came out just as the picture. I fell in love with it. Comfortable chair and the gliding was just fine but i quickly became dissapointed when one of the springs underneath the chair came lose. I have only sat on it about 4 times and i have only had this chair for a week. Im 37 weeks prego and weigh 167 lbs and while i was getting off the glider i heard the spring come loose. I am very dissappointed and as i go back to past reviews im not the only one who has had this problem my hubby had threw away the manuel so i cant even try to return it. he said its fixable just need something like super glue to keep the spring in place in the hole. This problem doesnt affect the chairs function and it isnt bothersome when the spring is placed to an angle over another spring. the chair still works great and it is still comfortable. nobody, unless they look under the chair will even know theres something wrong with it."
2,Poor quality,"Here are the major issues with this product:1. It sits way too close to the floor. I am 5'7 and my wife is 5'5. We both feel that the seat of the chair is too low. If you use the ottoman, it is not as much of an issue.2. The pads for the arm chairs are way too short. There is no slack. The buttons keep popping off. Also, on one side of the chair, the buttons were misaligned so we couldn't even use it.The only real pro is that it is easy to assemble."
3,Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman Set,"We just received this glider and have not had our baby yet. So far, the chair looks nice and is reletively comfortable. A little dissapointed in the chair cushion. It is a bit thin and pretty firm while the back cushion is on steroids. The other silly thing is that, while the ottoman comes assembled, you have to pull the cushion off to remove the protective plastic. I would say overall, for the money, it is a pretty good deal. I guess we will find out in the coming months!"
5,Very comfortable,We bought this when my wife was pregnant. It was recommended by one of our friend.Very comfortable chair. It was very useful during her pregnancy. Highly recommended for expecting moms.
2,worked great for the first 6 months or so,"We bought this glider and ottoman for our baby's nursery, and I used it every day while nursing. The glider looks as pictured, and it is easy to assemble. The seat cushion is thin but comfortable enough. When we first bought it, the chair and ottoman both glided smoothly and quietly. After about 6 months the chair started squeaking loudly and the bolts started loosening and falling off. We used WD-40 on the chair and it didn't help. We had to stop using the chair because the squeaking kept the baby awake, instead of helping him fall asleep! We also tightened the bolts several times but they kept loosening and eventually bent, so we gave up."
2,"You're you're smaller, and ok with small defects it'll do","Just put this thing together, pretty easy with basic instructions. Noticed right off the bat, the side cushions aren't long enough to snap into place and therefore i'll have to stretch them out somehow to make them snap on. Also, I'm 250---and when I sat down gently in it. I could hear crack, creek. Granted, this is for my wife but brand new out of the box having this problem tells me its good for smaller people, won't last long, and well poor quality."
2,"Comfortable, but squeaks and makes noises.","I love how comfortable this chair is. Unfortunately after a few weeks of using it, it started making awful squeaking/rubbing noise when the chair rocks. We've tried resolving the problem but it is no use. So now it is useless when trying to put the baby to sleep."
1,Do Not Recommend,"This rocker looks so much nicer than it actually is. Very easy to assemble, and the cherry wood is nice. But the cushions are terrible. The seat cushion, after one day, already feels flat. On day two, it's developed a squeak. I am not happy with purchase at all."
4,"Nice Color, Comfortable Ride, Can improve on upholstery","It was a nice purchase online. I saw this product by stork craft at a local store first and liked the make. For my online purchase, I was looking for better quality upholstery then the one it came with. It has a cordierite feel, I wanted more of comfortable cotton feel as at a local store. Returning big purchases like this could be pain in the neck. However, I liked the overall make and color of it, fits in nicely with my living and bedroom color styles and nice for lulling my two babies to sleep. I like the product and recommend it to anyone looking for one."
1,Very small!,"This chair is so small, I feel like I'm falling off of it. I am 5'4 and 110 lbs.-not very big....so if you are bigger than this, I definitely wouldn't recommend it. It is also incredibly uncomfortable. The cushions aren't thick or quality enough for my comfort."
3,you get what you pay for,"We bought this glider because it received decent reviews for the price.Pros:-fast shipment-easy to assemble-cheapCons:-Glider does recline but does not lock into place-Padding is very very thinI am only 170 lbs and after a couple months of use, I can feel the wooden back of the glider.I should've paid extra for a better glider"
2,Ottoman damage,"I got the package in a somewhat beat up condition with a big tear on one of the edges with a wood part exposed. Thankfully there wasn't a mark on the wood so I was relieved. I put the chair together in minutes and was pretty happy. I was even happier that the ottoman didn't have to be built at all. That is, until I started pulling apart the plastic covering the cushion. As I was removing the plastic from underneath of the cushion, I noticed a crack that ran edge-to edge for the support part of the ottoman cushion. Basically, if it was ever sat on, it would just break in half. Also, two of the legs supports were cracked pretty badly. I hated to have to go through the trouble of disassembling it to return it, but there was no other choice. Stinks pretty bad."
2,Amazon customer service SUCKS,I just recieved this glider as a gift and there were NO screws sent. I contacted AMAZON.COM customer service with ZERO help. They told me the only option I had was to send the entire 40lb box back...for only 8 screws. You mean to tell me that you cannot get 8 screws from the manufacturer. I am so frustrated with this so called customer service at amazon.com. Truely dissapointed.
1,Damaged Product NO RESPONSE FROM SELLER OR AMAZON,The chair itself is good but the OTTOMAN comes damaged and broken seller or amazon will not and refuses to address the problem so do not buy from them . I was forced to have to go out and buy a seperate OTTOMAN I REPEAT DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER
4,the glider is great.. but they send me the wrong pieces..!!!!,"hi, the glider is great and comfortable..but... they send me a wrong number of pieces!!! i send this glider to mexico as a gift.. so i feel terrible when they told me about the pieces.You have to be carefull if you are going to buy it!"
4,You can't beat it for the price!,"For the price, you can't beat this glider. I read all the reviews before puchasing and decided to go ahead and give it a try. Like others have already stated, it's very easy to put together (only 8 screws). The cushions may not be the best, but it's comfortable to me and looks fine. I couldn't get my armrest cushions to snap on the outside, but in doesn't matter as I put some magazines in the pockets which weigh it down and you can't tell that it's not snapped down. Other than that, the glider is great and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I, too, am giving the glider 4 stars because of the cushions."
4,Good chair for a great price,"This chair was definitely worth it for the price. It was easy to assemble and glides smoothly. It looks exactly as pictured as well. The only slightly down side is that the seat cushion isn't very thick, but for the price, you really can't complain. It's worth buying if your on a limited budget and have a new baby on the way."
4,Rocking Chair,I bought this chair for my wife and I so we can nurse our baby while rocking. It is really nice looking and I think pretty well built for the price! The padding is pretty good but we really haven't used it too much yet as our baby isn't quite here yet. I think the padding will do just fine unless you use this as your lazyboy everyday all day in front of the tv. This is the chair for nursing mothers and families with babies! It is easy to assemble and I believe there are only 8 bolts total! Amazon does a great job of shipping the big box it comes in also. I think the chair got to my house in 2 days!
3,Overall ok for price... lot of room for improvement,Overall ok for price... lot of room for improvement- Could improve cushion quality- sometimes make suound like it is getting struck- feel's light for heavy duty use.
3,Good looking but very uncomfortable,"Purchased this chair admittedly for the price, and you do get what you pay for. The chair looks great but the seat is really uncomfortable. I'm looking for a new chair cushion for it. Otherwise, it works. Very easy to put together. I also have a Shermag glider and it is much more comfortable."
4,Good glider for a tight budget,"I purchased this chair because I saw it on sale thru Amazon. I have been shopping around for a while for a glider or rocker and didn't want to spend a lot of money. This was definitely the best price I had seen. Shipping was super fast and the glider arrived in a few days. It was very easy to put together. I will say that the chair itself feels a little on the small side to me (I'm 5'10""). It seems to be a decent quality, but not as nice as some of the more expensive chairs I have seen. You get what you pay for, right? I do think it will serve our purpose for now, and at a great price, which is exactly what I was looking for."
5,Great Rocker for the price!,"I was nervous at first to order this due to the other reviews but needed something in this price range. The glider looks great with the other espresso furniture in my baby's room. Yes the cushion is a little bit thin, and the chair back is a tad short. But for the price it is a great buy."
3,So so,Bought this chair for my pregnant wife in March 2010 and it does the job. Not impressed with the fabric but it's still in my living room.
4,great buy,"we priced this out and put it on our baby registry...at first i wasnt crazy about the idea of a glider but i am sure happy my husband convinced me. we live in a 1br apartment and this doesnt take up that much room..the glide/rock motion is pretty self contained so you can place it near a wall(as we did)..something you cant do with a regular rocking chair. It only has 6 screws..something that came in handy when my nesting kicked in at 5am and i assembled it. after it was all assembled it looks very nice ...and after a weekend of nonstop nesting when i finally crashed i spent hours in this chair perfectly comfortable! and it has great pockets in the arms so i put an extra burp cloth, wipes and my 'essentials'"
4,Serves it's purpose,For $139 what can you really expect. The chair needs extra cushion on the bottom (which is accomplished by buying some foam pads and it begins to squeak after a while (which could probably be fixed with some WD-40) but it certainly serves it's purpose. Overall I'm fairly pleased with it. It looks nice and was extremely easy to assemble. It came to my house less than 24 hours after ordering it. It has rocked my son to sleep every night for the last 5 months and I am glad that I bought it.
3,A little disappointed,"I read a lot of the reviews on this chair before purchasing and unfortunately I gotta say that I am a little disappointed in the product. At first I was very excited and pleased, it was so simple to put together, took my husband a whole 5 minutes; it looks great; pretty comfortable. However 6 weeks after getting it a spring broke under the seat...Its not that we are heavy people, I'm only 130 lbs and my baby still only 10 lbs, so I just think the quality of the chair isnt as good as it could be. We removed the spring, and its still comfy, and now doesn't make a noise because of a broken spring. Besides the spring, its a great product."
2,Everything is great except seat cusion is almost flat after only a week of use.,"Chair looks nice and was easy to assemble, but seat cusion is almost flat after only a week of use. Its already uncomfortable to sit in."
1,Broken hardware (brass bolt) included,"I tried to assemble this glider chair, however one of the 6 small bolts included for assembly was broken. The end of the bolt (where the allen wrench fits) was not punched correctly at the factory, and therefore the allen wrench will not seat into the bolt head. Totally frustrating. I contacted Amazon to try to get just a replacement bolt but they said I have to return the whole chair, which I have already mostly assembled and would have to spend 30 minutes taking apart and packing up again. Just for a bolt. Totally frustrating, and too much inconvenience to return this bulky item. I will just buy a replacement bolt next time I go to the hardware store."
5,This rocker ROCKS!,We LOVE our Glider for the baby.... it was perfect for the middle of the night feedings and nice to put your feet up and rock with little man! I sat in it even before the baby was born!!! :)
4,Good Enough for the Money,"For the price, this chair is what you would expect to get! I looked at more expensive chairs at Babies R Us and other furniture stores and none of them were fantastic - so for the price of this chair, it is nice. The bottom cushion is pretty thin, however I'm sure we will add more foam/padding down the road. I haven't had any problems with the chair squeaking or creaking, but I haven't sat in it that much yet as my little one wont arrive for another few weeks. For now, I like the chair!"
4,great value for a comfortable chair,My husband assembled the chair but didn't seem to have any issues with it. The cushions are very comfortable. It is a great value for a quality chair and ottoman set.
2,Mediocre,"This rocker is mediocre but then the price is very inexpensive. The rocker itself is pretty solid but the ottoman is relatively useless and you're likely to trip over the thing in a dark room. I set one knee down on the ottoman and the wood snapped in two and I'm not over weight, it's just cheap quality. There is also a heavy chemical smell in the cushions which is obviously the chemical smell from whatever material the Chinese manufacturer is using. We left the cushions out on the porch for a few days until the chemical smell aired out. Overall, it is what it is, a cheaply priced rocker for putting the baby to sleep."
2,Doesn't last,"Worked well at first, but after one year it wouldn't stop squeaking, and the ball bearings broke at two years, which rendered the chair totally useless. So after two years, off to the trash."
1,Worst Glider EVER,"I bought this glider after reading the mostly positive reviews, however I should've paid attention to the negative ones.First, they sent the wrong screws in the package. I had to contact the company and they sent me the correct ones. Then the cushion wore after 2-3 weeks of use. I had to go out and buy another cushion. The glider started creaking about 3 months in, now it pops, grinds, clicks, and creaks. It squeaks so loud that I can't even use it anymore to rock my child. And, just this week, the arm part broke off. Fantastic glider.WORST GLIDER EVER. DON'T BUY!!!!!My grandmother's glider from the 70's is so much better and is in perfect gliding condition. Spend the money and invest in a glider that will last a long time unlike this one."
3,Very good price; comfort is okay,"This is a nice enough chair. The ottoman is comfortable and the chair glides smoothly. The only thing is that the seat needs more cushioning and/or lumbar support. Especially if you're pregnant, your lower back and rear end will get sore unless you add support."
4,glider,"Bought two, one for a baby shower gift and one for a daycare center I own. Worth the price. The one in the daycare center was used in the toddler room and took a beating by both the children and teachers. Was used non stop 12 hours a day. Lasted for two years. One arrived broken and Amazon arranged for ups to pick up and return to them and sent new one out immediatley at no charge to me. Amazon is GREAT about exchanging and giving GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"
4,good combo for the price,"purchased this set for my wife and our newborn based on the reviews from other amazon shoppers. pretty much what everyone said was right on the button. the pluses for this set: price; smooth rocker; easy assembly. the minuses for this set: back cushion has tendency to slide down, causing head to bump wooden part of chair; seat cushion could be thicker. overall, we are all pleased with this purchase."
4,Great to have,"Easy to put together, sturdy chair. A little smaller than I expected but a great chair."
4,very nice starter chair,Expecting our first baby. This was a great buy for our price range. A little smaller than the photo and cushions aren't very thick but still good for it's price!
2,did anyone put this thing together?,"This chair was relatively easy to put together until the last part, which was the armcovers. They are too short to fit over the arms and one of the rivets was placed too close to a vertical piece of frame to get the snap over it. How dumb is this?"
2,defective part,One of the screw parts was not drilled out correctly. There was no phone number as to how to get a replacement part. The chair is now super glued!
3,Nice but pointless,Nice condition and quality but not very comfortable for long periods of sitting. I wish I had bought a big cozy recliner instead. Kind of pointless and now it just takes up space and I need to get rid of it.
1,Hunk of Junk,Have had this chair 3.5 months and it has completely fallen apart-literally. The arm rest came off first and then the spindles followed soon after. do not buy if you want it to be anything lasting
2,Our baby loves a Glider....,"We ordered this product and assembly was easy, and within minutes we were rocking our baby to sleep. Other than the white color which I treated the fabric with scotch guard, we were happy. Flash forward to a month later. On the glider, both wood support pieces on the right side cracked. I don't know if we just got a lemon, but I won't be replacing this item with another one from the same company. I guess I will go with the I got what I paid for, and just invest in a better one next time."
2,Makes squeaking sounds and glider spring comes out,one of the glider springs came out within a week and it was dangerous as the mother could have fallen inside. I had a very tough time getting it fixed. sometimes the glider make squeaking sounds. Would not recommend this to anyone else.The manufacturers should fix the spring so that it does not come out.
5,Very comfy..I like it,"Since I found out I was pregnant I told my boyfriend I wanted a glider. So we went looking at popular baby stores in our area but they were just to expensive and the seat portions were narrow. Then I went on Amazon I found this one. He ordered it immediately and in less then a week it arrived. I was at work the day it arrived and he assembled it in less than 20 mins. As Soon as I got home I sat on it to check the seat size and was totally satisfied. I am 8 months and sit in it comfortably. The cushion is wide, nice, soft and thick. I still haven't given birth but I sit on it everyday as I watch tv. I love it. My only gripe is the chenille fabric it tends to pick up any little dirt or dust, so I just wipe it down. I cant wait to rock my baby to sleep or breastfeed comfortable on it."
3,"Reasonably priced, or ""you get what you pay for""","Not of the greatest quality. Many, many manufacturing defects on the wood. Fortunately, the fabric and cushions mask most of them.Assembly is a cinch. One person can assemble this rocker, although having my wife help was nice.It is a bit smaller than I imagined, but it will do the trick."
4,good value,"This is not the fanciest glider, but for the money, this is a very good value. Packaged well, easy to put together, comfy, and does what you'd expect it to do. The pockets on the side are a nice touch for keeping books and other small items handy. Much better than a traditional rocker for the money. Especially since for this price, the Ottoman is included. That's a nice bonus!"
4,Amazing Glider but just one but...,"I received my glider today, soooo excited! And it's really amazing. It was very easy to assemble and 'glides' like a dream. I think it's also amazing what you receive for your money. A well built, quality rocking chair with an additional rocking ottoman. I really think you get your money's worth and more. There is a but though - the fumes. I assembled it in my baby's room but had to take it out because the fumes were overpowering. I also wiped down the microsuede to see if that did something to the intense smell, but didn't really make a difference. I will be airing it out for a few days before I actually put it back in my baby's room. Can't help but worry what type of chemical is so overpowering. At the end of the day, anything you buy today will be treated with something, which is why I can't give this product a negative review regardless of this problem. I'm sure in a couple days it will clear out."
3,Got broken ottoman,"Got the product delivered yesterday with the broken ottoman.I clearly went through the damaged ottoman and it doesn't look like shipping damage.I read the reviews and most of the people here complained about receiving the broken glider/ottoman.I don't want to go through the return process as it weighs 40 lbs.I think they should thoroughly check the product before putting it into box, like me most of the people may not want to go through the return process.Its easy to fix and I paid 129 $ and its worth for that money."
4,My favorite product so far,This glider was easy to assemble. A total of 20min max from start till finish. The only problem I see is the seat cushion could be just a little bit thicker. Over all I would still recommend this to someone. Ive been sitting in it for up to 30mins w no problems though.
3,Decent but doesn't last long,"This is a beautiful chair but within one month the padding in the seat was completely wore down. (I am not large, I weigh 115) The fabric was also slightly rough. When I sat with my bare back against it it felt as if there were tiny splinters embedded in the fabric so I had to keep a blanket draped over the back of it. I would have given this 5 stars had a different fabric and padding been used."
2,Looks pretty but poor quality,"Was comfortable at first, but not for long sitting/nursing sessions. Not cushy enough. After a couple of months, it starting squeaking and my husband had to buy some wood glue to help hold one of the metal bars that holds the spring base in place as it popped out of its hole. We will see if that helps. Would never recommend it."
1,"If I could go back in time and buy something else, I would","Although this has been a nice-looking glider and ottoman, after only a couple months this rocker started to give us problems. Not only did the metal parts of the gliding mechanism start to click and squeak, the wooden portion where the back fits to the seat also creaks. No amount of tightening screws or WD40 has helped more than a week or so at a time, and the clicking never goes away. It kind of defeats the purpose of rocking a baby with all that creaking, clicking, and squeaking. It's been nice to have pockets on the side to keep bedtime stories and burp cloths. Maybe it's just been our rocker, but if I could go back in time and spend my money on something else - even if it cost a bit more, I would."
2,Low quality - no QC,Received item with defects - screw anchors are missing from the base frame. Visible scratches are every where on the chair frame.Here's a summary:- No quality control- Bad packaging for shipment- Low cost
3,nice but way to small,This glider set is really cute and goes with my nursery. The only reason it's getting the 3stars is because it way to small and no head rest. I am only 5'2 100 pounds and i can barely fit in it.... it's not that comfy to spend a lot of time in it... too bad or else it's cute and really arrived on time and well.
1,Constantly Breaks,This chair looks nice but we have had nothing but issues with this chair. It breaks all the time - we have had to repair the rocker parts - the arms are always falling off. Terrible chair
1,Poor design,"Bought on christmas, on the second day the springs in the chair seat came off, so bad and have to return the item."
2,Sent us one that had been open and missing all the hardware,I bought this online and had it sent to MO. as a gift for my niece's babyshower. It was sent to my parent's house where the showerwas being held so my Dad could put it together. Whoever sent it to us sent us a box that had been retaped shut and missing all the hardware. So the chair could be ready in time my 71 year old father had to go to the hardware store to buy missing parts and he even had to make some parts... Luckily his past career as an aerospace engineer/nutty professor made himqualified for this task. I think it would have beenvery difficult though for the average Joe. They have said the chair is very nice but had I known that the companysells used opened products as new ones I would have not ordered. I tried to report it through amazon but there was nothing I could do since I was not returning the product.It would be nice for them to send my Dad a check for $20 which he spent buying parts for what they should have provided.
4,Hoop Glider/Ottoman,"The chair assembly was quite easy. It took barely anytime to put the items together. I wish that the actual cushion that you sit on was thicker(more padding). Despite that, the chair and ottoman move nicely. Furniture is also light weight, which makes it easy to move into different rooms. The price is right too! You won't break the bank for these items."
3,Glider,"The Glider was received with an arm of the glider repaired. Since the repair is not visible, the damaged arm does not show. However in time, it may crack and be a problem.If units have a defect, it should be made known. The price of the glider was competitive, but not enough to off set damaged goods.Since this was a gift, it is concerning.[ASIN:B000F78UAU Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman Cushion in Cherry Wood and Beige Corduroy]]"
4,"Cute, but small","This chair is very cute, sturdy, and well made. The only thing is it is a bit too tight I'm 5'5"" and 160 lbs during pregnancy it felt a bit tight on the sides. After baby was born its comfy, but would go for a bigger size or different chair. Other wise great chair for the price. Would recommend."
4,Not bad at all,"Worth the money, I read reviews and don't understand some of them. I am 6'1"" 220 lbs and I have yet to crush or break this chair or even hear squeaks thus far. Wife loves it, cushion is not a plush couch like cushion but for a chair it's sufficient. Definitely worth the money."
4,ROCKING CHAIR FOR MY NEW GRANDBABY,THIS CHAIR WAS BOUGHT FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO WILL BE HAVING HER FIRST BABY IN JUNE OF 2011. THE CHAIR IS A LITTLE LOWER THEN I THOUGHT BUT IS VERY EASY TO SIT IN FOR MY DAUGHTER. IT WAS VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND TRANSPORT TO HER HOUSE. THE FOOT STOOL MAKES A NICE ADD ON.
2,"cheap cost, cheap value",I returned this after using in for a few days. It was clearly cheap and could be felt in the cheap microfiber which was very scratchy and the cheap foam underneath that held the impression of your butt and feet in the cusions. Not impressed. It's worth spending a little more for more comfort.
2,Poor Quality,"We selected this chair because it was more financially feasible. However, we should have sent it back and bought one of better quality. We were disappointed in the poor quality of the pre-drilled holes and the poor lining up of the parts as we were putting it together. The cushions are cheap and already have ""sit"" marks on them (we have only had it for two weeks). I would recommend a higher quality chair."
4,Love this Glider!!,"After researching in different websites, this particular glider kept coming above the rest. We received it in a timely manner, as usual, from Amazon. My husband put it together in 30 minutes without help. I love this Hoop Glider! It's very comfortable along with the ottoman. I'm 34 weeks pregnant, so I haven't actually used it to comfort baby yet. The ONLY Negative point I can see for this chair is that it is kinda short, perfect for me since I am 5'2"". However my husband is 5'9"", so he'd be more comfortable with a headrest or taller chair. Overall, this is a winner for me, and I can't wait to use it daily when baby Sophia arrives!"
2,Did not last...,"We bought this glider pending the birth of our second child. It seemed good enough when we first got it, but within a month or so, we had one of the springs from the cushion popping off repeatedly. We removed it from the bottom since it wouldn't stay in place. About six months later, a second spring did the same thing. Today, about 11 months after purchase, one of the rods that holds the gliding mechanism in place came out from the holder and the whole thing is now trash. When you open it, the rod slides into a groove that is surrounded by six ball bearings housed in a flimsy casing (thickness of thin-gauge wire) and a very thin ring surrounding that. Both of these looked like they had been chewed on by a dog. Very disappointed that it didn't even last a year. Buy at your own risk."
1,Stained glider poor customer service,I ordered this glider for my expecting daughter. The ottomon came wrapped in plastic with the cushion badly stained. When my daughter called to see about returning the foot ottoman she was met with the worse customer service. She decided then to just return the entire glider an ottoman. Encountering problems with customer service again. Plus they would only give her 139.00 dollars. When we paid over 200.00 dollars. I make purchases with amazon all the time spending a great deal of money. Also as my children have registries for my grandchildren. I now will discourage family an friends to no longer buy through amazon. Also I have a friend having nothing but problems with amazon customer care in the return of a damaged table. Laurie Luna Stockton California !!!!!
2,its ok....cheap but ok,"I am 8 months pregnant and was able to put the rocking chair together by myself. I think its ugly and cheap looking. I sat in it for 2 mins and when i took my feet off the ottoman there was marks from where my feels had been resting. The cushions is thin and not comfy at all and the fabric is not soft. I wish i had got a better chair :( I do like the size of the chair, not to big not to small, fits nice in babies room. I would not recommend this chair to anyone..."
4,I'm Happy,"I finally fixed up my nursery today, and tested out my glider and ottoman. Its nice and can't wait to use it. The fabric is not that soft and comfy as some people like when they suddenly sit on a chair. Its cushioned enough for me. If you want you can place a flat pillow on your bottom, to be more comfy. You can also lay your head back on the back pillow. Now that part is relaxing. It was easy to assemble. It took my husband about 15 mins to put it together. I told him to do it right, cause I didn't want to be falling if I have baby in my arms. So I watched him. And it came in a huge box and packaged very well."
3,Great value,"This glider assembled easily and works great. Seems very solid, as though it could last 20 years. But it isn't very comfortable for long sits, and the back doesn't recline. Of course it doesn't claim to recline, but if I was doing it over I would spend a bit extra for one that reclines and has a little more padding or spring under the backside."
5,A good buy,This chair and ottoman are not as soft as I thought they would be. However they are still quiet comfortable. The chair only had 3 parts to put together and I had no problem doing so by myself. A really good choice for the price.
4,Best Glider,"I reviewed many Gliders, I read all the reviews and was totally confused, after read the reviews on this product I decided to take a gamble. I am totally pleased with this product. Amazon shipment was great, it was to my doorstep within 4 days. Assembly was a easy, my neice and her husband was able to assemble it. This Glider makes no noise and it's great. I am happy that I took a chance on this and purchased it."
3,Ok for price but terrible smell,"This is a nice glider for the price. We looked at lots of different gliders and tried a bunch out at Babies R' Us. This glider is comparable to the ones we tried. The biggest negative is the smell of the cushions when we opened the box. The cushions filled the room with a strange, chemical smell, I guess it is the man made materials and the foam used to make the product. We had to leave it outside on our porch for 2 days before we could even think of bringing it in the house. When my husband put it together in the nursery, the whole room smelled awful. Although the smell is better, and the glider is back in the house, you can still smell it faintly when you are sitting in it and that makes me a little nervous."
2,TERRIBLE!!!,"I'm giving this 2 stars because it actually does work as a glider..This is a terrible glider. We just put it together, and there we stains all over the ottoman. The cushion is so uncomfortable. Its just a thin piece of foam. The wood creeks when you sit in it. I am not a heavy person at all! The cherry wood is a nice color. I will invest in something better!"
3,MORE CUSHION FOR THE PUSHIN',Seat cushion is lacking and could definately use ALOT MORE padding. You cannot sit for extended periods without becoming slightly uncomfortable. Functional for nursey room (rocking and feeding baby) but not for overall comfort. I definately would not consider purchasing this as a reading or sitting chair. Great neutral color and material cleans easily.
4,A comfy seat for pregnancy,"I ordered this for nursing my baby, but he hasn't arrived quite yet! I am sure it will be perfect! It has dually been a great place for me to rest and put my feet up during pregnancy. I am petite (5' 2"") so it is a perfect fit for me. It was super easy to assemble and fits nicely in our small city apt."
3,Good but not the best,So we have this for more than 5 months. It's very comfortable and I can easy remove any stains. We got it in beige/black so I was worry but I can remove anything just with clean water. I gave it 3 stars only because the first time I seat on it one of the springs that you seat on broke!! Since I had a newborn I didn't have time to call and get replacement. As of few days ago it's not only making crazy noises the broken spring is blocking something that doesn't allow me to swing in it. I called to Amazon today and we are getting a replacement. So be aware that it might brake very easily. Other than that very comfy chair
3,"Industrial fabric, not soft nursery decor","We ordered it in cherry finish, and it is a true cherry color. However, the material used for the cushions is a hard, scratchy, industrial-type dark beige fabric with a burlap feel; definitely not something I would pick out for a nursery. It looks soft and comfortable in the picture, but we don't find that to be the case. I will have to recover it in order to match the ivory color in our nursery.Overall, it is okay, but in retrospect, I would probably spend the extra money for a different brand."
3,egh- its aight,this chair is not bad for the price but my major complaint is that the cushioning on the seat is not very thick. my butt gets numb after a half hour of sitting. construction quality is not bad at all and it does make some noises but thats probably because of the kind of construction.
3,Broke after 2 weeks!,I received this item for my baby shower and I was so excited to use it. We came home with our son and my husband sat in the chair and the legs just busted and broke. My husband is not heavy what so ever so we were really surprised about this. Plus..the chair is really petite and short..not made for men but for smaller women like myself..I have not even had a chance to enjoy it yet...time to go return it.ProsEasy to AssembleFits Anywhere
5,great chair,First comfortable chair i have sat in in weeks! ( I am 32 wks preg with twins) and i even git a nap in on it for the first time in a good while! Put it together myself in about ten min. ( didnt have the patience to wait for somekne to get home and help.)
4,Good Autobiography,"I thought it was fairly well written, Jackie was not known for being reserved. She tells about her childhood and her life as a beautician. How she met her rich husband and how she started her own cometic company and why she began flying. She tells little of how she manipulated her way into starting the WASP's. That she was successful, demonstrates her will. She tells about how she broke women's speed records after the fall of the WASP's, I felt she was using her money for a last swan song. In ""Jackie Cochran"" written with Maryanne Bucknum Brinley, thoughts from Chuck Yeager are enlightening. Brinley's book uses much of what is in ""The Stars at Noon"", and adds thoughts from her friends and I felt it was a little better organized."
1,Same experience - doesn't snap,"I bought some of these Tomcat brand at Lowe's - which look the same as the Victor brand.Little did I know that the spring/catch don't work as well. They are more difficult to set, & so far, the bait is eaten but the trap doesn't spring (on all 3 units). The Victor brand works much better."
2,Terrible book,"Perhaps this book may serve some function as an ESL text book in the states but if you are teaching internationally this book is horribly unqualified. The outdated photos, and lackluster drawings make it hard to really get into the book, and the very basic grammar and vocabulary can be taught in about a week without the need of 200 pages. For international students the huge focus on American currency (with outdated photos) and the steps for getting a job in the states is needless information for 99% of the students. The book is written for immigrants who are coming to live in the US and are not savvy with language education. This is fine except for PearsonLongman's wild push to make a few bucks by selling it as an international textbook.Can you cook?No, but I'm a fast learner."
3,Student,"This is a very basic text, for beginners. If even a little English is known, the book will be thought a repeat"
5,Kaytee exact rainbow food chuncky for parrots,"My Macaw , Bobbye Bird enjoys the flavors, I enjoy the ease of feeding an no seed hull mess. Bobbye is thriving on it I will reorder"
3,USED TO BE BETTER,"I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS. THE AGE OF MY COCKATOO. AT ONE TIME IT HAD LARGER CHUNKS,AND DIDN'T HAVE THE DARK PURPLE PIECES IN IT.MY BIRD WILL NOT EVEN TOUCH THEM. ALL BIRDS ARE PICKY,BUT I HAVE A FRIEND THAT OWNS AN AVIARY,AND SHE CLAIMS THE SAME THING ABOUT THE NEW DARK PURPLE PIECES,AND THE FRUIT FLAVOR. SHE HAS SWITCHED TO A DIFFERENT BRAND,AND I'M CONSIDERING IT."
2,Greatest car songs by the beach boys,"quality of the sound is poor, I have another cd of car songs that is much more pleasant to hear.. I liked the songs just not the quality!"
3,A selection of classics for classic car lovers,"A solid collection of automobile- and motorcycle-related hits from the Beach Boys. At the right price, it's an incredible steal for someone who may not want a more complete collection...or someone like me looking to add to their music collection a select few songs that aren't found in the more popular compilations."
1,Maybe worth it... depending,"The clips on this disk are OK. Some of them really resonate but overall, it's not so special. While the content is adequate to interesting, you'd be better off tracking these down on YouTube, which is what it looks like the producers of this disk did. The image quality is so low-rez that the chunkiness and artifacts are really obvious on a TV screen or computer monitor. Historically, it's worth the money but the image quality is so poor that I'd recommend you find other sources."
1,Walk Away,"I was hoping this phone would be better than my 2.4GHZ Uniden.The 2.4 has a range of about 125ft. I can keep the non-base headset in the shop at 100 ft and it works fine.The 5588 starts hissing and popping at the back door -- one floor under the headset. I can't make it 1/3 the distance of the older model. BY the time I get to the shop the phone quits.So instead of ditching my old 2.4, I've maxed out the recharge ability of both 2.4s. This is really irritating since the 2.4 kills my Wi-Fi connection and the 5.8 does not.Time to buy another phone set and since I can't count on Uniden, it will be a Panasonic. Both Unidens go into the garabge (after recycling the batteries)."
3,wireless telephone system,"The telephones are light and handy, but the range is not very far. My office is on one side of the house, and when I try to use my phone on the other side you loose a clear signal. The phones do not have an antenna sticking out of the phones (my old wireless phones did and they had great reception -- just couldn't get the handsets anymore they were so old)."
4,a good Halloween flick,"I don't think this a milestone in anime by any means, and I don't even think it's that great of a story. But one thing it does do right is portray the perfect atmosphere.The lighting, the art, and the colors just scream ""Halloween"" when you watch this. It's very fluid, but as another reviewer mentioned, the CGI seemed unnecessary and it made it look more like a video game sequence than an anime. A little disappointing, but nothing to fret about.I'd say don't expect a great original story from this because, let's face it, how much can they really do in 25 minutes? Rent this on Halloween with your friends and turn off the lights for a creepy half hour of fun, but don't expect to be scared senseless. Watch it more for the art and atmosphere than a good scare."
4,Nice short film,"Great short film. I loved it the first time I saw it on Adult Swim of Halloween 2005 and never got around to purchasing it. Could be made into a series easily if they wanted to. My only complaint is that it is quite short, but it was meant to be this way."
4,Unique Anime based child game,"This Anime is a little hard to find, but is beautifully done. Was originally shown on Cartoon Network around Halloween of 2005. The Anime itself is based on a game of tag with a supernatural twist. Overall the movie is worth seeing at least once. A great addition to any Anime-lovers library.However it is not exactly for those with young children, as it deals with themes that may be either scary or slightly adult in nature.I found it entertaining and its a good blend of artwork and story-telling. A little disappointed with the ending, but its a minor fault in an otherwise decent movie such as this."
4,i saw it on adult swim too...,"yes i saw it on adult swim , but i was a little disappointed.one reason it's too short , the other one it's CGI animation , and i kind of don't like that, it takes away all of that great feeling , some other great anime have.anyway i would suggest you watch it first then give your own opinion , to see if you want to buy it or not...i thought the story was great and everything , but it just wasn't enough for me. other anime i recommend :kare kano (his and her circumstances)rurouni kenshindragon ball znarutoappleseedyuyu hakushosamurai champlooelfen liedall of the miyazaki-san filmsand fullmetal alchemist"
2,Too short,"Visually stunning, but at less than half an hour for the asking price? Maybe it's a better rental."
1,The suckiest racing game for N64....,"Don't let any of the good reviews fool you. I was one of the ones who bought the N64 new, and at the time Goldeneye and Cruisin USA were on everyone's mind. I bought Goldeneye and it was awsome.........as you already know ""Cruisin"" sucked. The graphics and control are pitiful. It's like the game was put out early to meet a deadline. The cars turn on a dime. (meaning that the slightest touch on the stick spins you off the road or into oncoming traffic ) I'm not even sure why I gave this game 1 star, oh well. On a better note, Cruisin World and Cruisin Exotica are excellent. It's like a totally different company released the two......."
3,Crusin started a style all its own.,"I see a lot of negitive reviews here. You have to remember this is an old game now, but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers. This game was released in arcades in 94 and two years later it finally made it home. But unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it ""E"". This game just came to late. It was still a fun game, but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too. But in 96 it was still really well liked, but just didn't age well. But for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the 96 release date."
5,Great!,"I'm pleased that I received this game quickly, it was like the description said, in a box & the sender even wrote on the outside ""Amazona order ####"" so I remembered when I got it in the mail that I ordered this package, since it was from an unrecognized address."
5,A fascinating game for the N64,"I thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the N64 so so early of a release. This is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and I was suprised to find such a fun game.However the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out, some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards. The records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system, I'm not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucks.Still like I said earlier, this is an early title for the N64, you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is. Buy it if your into race games, ignore it if your looking for the best."
2,Very Disappointing,"This game was not even worth buying. In my opinion, Mario Kart 64 was much better than this game. It only has one racing mode with a few courses, and its multiplayer [isn't good]. It is easy to beat in the 1 player mode also. This game is not worth its price."
2,nothing like the arcade version,"I always enjoyed playing the arcade version of Cruis'n USA and I looked forward to playing it when I heard it was coming to the Nintendo 64. Even the first previews that I saw in Gamepro looked pretty good and loyal to the coin-op version. When I finally played it for the N64, I was bigtime disappointed. The graphics and sound are the only good parts about the game. The control is not the best and it's only fun for a few races. What I really didn't like about it is when someone crashes in front of you, you can get stuck behind them with nowhere to go. There is no reverse in this game, leaving you stuck behind a car in the middle of the road with no way to get around it. Cruis'n World is A LOT better than Cruis'n USA. I definitely wouldn't recommend getting this game. If you have to play it, just rent it."
2,"Fun, but only for a little while","It is fun to drive across the country once, to see all of the different courses and whatnot, but after that the difficulty levels and selection of cars offer little enjoyment. Lack of four player game is a big negative as well."
1,Stay away from this one,"I got Cruisn' USA about three years ago for my birthday and itties with F-Zero-X .... Thegraphics[are not so great] and the gameplay is too easy and too short. I beat the whole thing in like 2 hours the first day I got it. It is nothing like the arcade version which I have played too. In my opinion, stay away from this one and go for the Sanfrancisco Rush games. Those are real games. Don't be mislead by the player's choice label. Alot of people thought this would be better."
1,cruis'n usa 1977,game didn't work when we got it. bought it used. was too cheap to go to the trouble of sending it back for a refund.
1,This Game Is Unreal And Dum,"I really don't think that you should buy this game. The idea is cool, but it just makes it dumb because it has STUPID graphics. Now this is one of those games where you have basically NO control over your car, and speaking of cars, the cars are all stupid too. If you played this game with the graphics of Rush or something, I would give it a better review. But overall, this game REALLY stinks. I don't Recommend buying this game."
3,Restricted driving ability .. boring tracks. Good images.,"This game could be so much better, the graphics are great and sound is ok. The cars are very nice but the driving ability is restricted, you cannot drive in reverse or in wrong way."
4,A retro review,"I hate all the people saying bad things about this game. Remember this game came out in 1994 in the arcades then on the N64 in 1996. This game came out before gran tourismo, need for speed,and midnight club. Crusin usa is weak compared to todays games but was awsome when it first came out. Those who had fun playing this game when they were a kid will buy this game. If you want great graphics, sound, and more subtance dont buy this game. I think its good and very fun."
1,disappointed,"This sourcebook is so shallow and general that, except for a few key internet sites, it is not worth the money. Only 20 pages are devoted to issues directly related to the meniscus, woefully less than I had already found with a 'google search'. And so much is mainly padding. For example, in 'Additional Resources' it lists a web site for 'Hospice Care'. (If you are ready for a hospice than the knee is the least of your worries!) The vocularies are also padded. For example, do you really need definitions for 'stomach', 'oral', 'cadaver', etc.? Do you need info on how to find medical insurance, or advice about telling the doctor where it hurts? I didn't. And don't expect to find any books listed under the Chapter entitled, 'Books on injuries to the meniscus'. However, If you will be satisfied with the few truly useful websites listed, then buy this book. I, however, returned it immediately, went to my local medical library and found a good librarian."
3,Good for chess teachers,"A good book for chess teachers. Why? Well, this book is full of players making horrible opening blunders, and getting quickly demolished for their mistakes! Each game in this book is suitable for a 10-25 minute lesson, and that's what I use it for.To learn how to improve chess by learning what not to do, and then avoiding what not to do, is a surprisingly underrated way of improving your skill. This book fits squarely in that mode."
2,"A Fine Story, Marred by Poor Package","The ""Robin"" in this package, of course, is Dick Grayson, the son of trapeze artists murdered by gangsters attempting to extort ""protection"" money from the circus' owner. In taking Dick as his ward, Bruce Wayne attempts to protect the boy from some of the suffering Wayne himself has endured from being orphaned; in training Dick to be a young crimefighter, Batman helps the boy to sublimate his personal grief into benefitting the cause of justice for all. In this story, we see what happens when Dick is old enough to chafe at being the ""boy wonder"" while discovering the man responsible for his parents' death. The interplay between Dick's struggling to be a man on his own and Bruce's unspoken paternal affection makes for a solid story.Unfortunately, this tape is not recorded in the SP mode. As a result, we get blotchy picture and indistinct sound. This story deserves better packaging."
2,A poor example,This DVD is neither endorsed nor authorized by the estate of Artie Shaw. It is a compilation of the playing of several big bands. The main complaint I have about it is the extremely poor quality of the filming. After that comes the awkward editing where there does not appear to be any logical connection between the scenes. Some pretty good playing is shown though the quality of sound is minimal at best. I do not recommend this DVD. There are other really fine DVDs of big bands that do much better. One that comes to mind right away is the series Jazz by Ken Burns.
4,Great music and musicans,Love seeing big band at their greatest along with the greatest music. I wish they had listed the names of the musicans.
5,Great Selector CD,"I saw the Selector in 1980, I was right at the stage in NY around 45th St (coulda touched Pauline Black!), I was 16 and new to the whole scene (who was'nt?). The Selector put on an awesome show! So I've been kinda thinking of this short lived group recently, having played to death The English Beat, The Specials, Madness, and others over the past 20 years. This CD for the price, I got mine new at Amazon.com, was a great buy!"
2,VERY premature debut.,"Spence has written one outstanding story (the title story) and has churned out many acceptable, workmanlike efforts as well; but this, unfortunately, does not make an interesting collection. The funny, juvenile Seventeen story (""Isabelle and Violet"",) in particular, sat uncomfortably beside the more depressed, serious pieces about adults. It seems to have been crammed into the collection because it was published somewhere. Most of these stories I forgot after I read them; some I even forgot as I was reading them. Judging from the final story, Spence has got real talent, but even the brightest talent needs a decade or two to develop, and I hope she isn't in a rush to publish anytime soon."
1,DO NOT ORDER: YOU WILL NOT GET THE RIGHT WATCH,"I ordered this watch and recieved it with a grey face, not a blue face as described and pictured. I explained the problem and asked for a replacement watch, and got the same watch again. Amazon said there is nothing they can do to fix this problem, so I recommend that you do not order this watch!"
4,One for the fans.,"I agree with the first reviewer that the picture and sound quality is not great, certainly when compared to official releases from the "" Moon River Theatre "" and it is probably only when you receive the DVD that you realise it is not endorsed by MRT. Having said that, it has grown on me and includes some very good choreography from the TV shows, a song by the Williams Brothers and a very clever duet with Patti Page. Probably a DVD for loyal fans but worth the money. It does play on Region 2 DVD players (UK) so is probably multi-regional."
3,"Worth the money? Well, it depends ...","The other reviewers are certainly right in that the video & audio quality is poor, to say the least. On the other hand, there are quite a couple of gems on this DVD. I'm pretty glad that somebody said heck, better resurrect that material in a bad condition than not at all. So if you're an unconditional Andy Williams fan like me, go get it. Otherwise, you'll be far better off with The Best From the Andy Williams Show."
4,A special kind of Brazilian/jazz fusion . . .,". . . purveyed by the Black Sun label in the late eighties and early nineties. Perhaps best represented by flugelhornist Marcio Montarroyos's three wonderful discs, Terra Mater, Samba Solstice, and Congado, but also by Paul Horn and Walton Ornato, with their two discs, California Suite and Magic Mountain.Probably lacking the necessary rigor to vault it into five-star territory (hence the substracted star), it is nevertheless quite attractive and worth a listen. I'm glad to have reconnected with this unique vibe."
4,Nicely remastered Victor sides,"I've had the 78 rpm versions of about half of these sides for many years; it's nice to hear them without scratches, finally, as well as being (as far as I can tell) a complete collection.Dinah Shore never sang sweeter than on these earlier sides, the only possible exception being in the ""Up In Arms"" movie soundtrack from 1944. Her style was somewhat out of place with the predominantly 2-beat Dixieland style that these bands played, but they made room for her and she shines. Lena Horne was singing a softer style here than the charismatic belting that she became known for in later years, but she is more at home with the Dixie stylings than Dinah.This is a slice of history nicely preserved."
3,Not what I was hoping for,I've been sober 4 years and this book isn't good for parenting in ongoing sobriety. It's really meant for parents who are just getting sober and trying to put together the wreckage of their addiction on their family. I was hoping it would address the ongoing life of recovery and parenting but it didn't.
2,Not what I expected,"I had truly been looking forward to this book. After hearing so much about Jane Nelson and being in recovery, it sounded appropriate.Honestly, I didn't read past the first two or three chapters; the book seems to have been written for someone either still abusing alcohol or drugs - or someone who is just now in the beginning stages of recovery. . . and that's not where I am in my life.I will definitely hold onto the book and hopefully can pass it on to someone who needs it."
1,Threw this bottle away after 1 week,This shampoo was terrible for my hair. I could only use it for 1 week before I had to throw it away and get special repair products to mend my parched locks. I don't know how much color lock it has - seems irrelevant if my hair felt so awful after using it. I also had the conditioner and threw that away too.
5,LOVE THE HIGHLIGHTS,Don't waste your money on professional highlights which I have done. Highights look very natural. Have received many compliments on my hair. Love the ShiKai hair products. Highly recommend if you want a subtle highlight in your hair.
3,Gucci Nobile for men is great however I found mine cheaper at,Gucci Nobile is one of the most beautiful masculin fragrance in the world...Be sure of that. however I found mine Cheaper at thefragrancefactory.com
2,"Great idea, doesn't work","My daughter received this for her first birthday. It was even difficult for us to use, as well as it didn't fit either one of our tubs. We were so excited because it looked great, but the penguins don't slide down very well at all. It was more of a tumble.Overall, it was a great idea, but it just doesn't work.--Dawn"
3,just okay,"I will start this out by saying the kids love this bath toy. However, I am slightly disappointed for two reasons. The small pools do not hold water very well, it drains pretty quickly. Second, there is no easy way to store this toy, unless you leave in place all the time."
4,Happy with this toy,"Actually, this toy has been good for both my kids--1 and 4. My older child, a boy, used the toy more normally. He experimented a lot with using the slot dams and building up the water level--then he'd open the gate and the penguin would go right down the slide. We put the spinning wheel on the side of the tub, so there are two toys to play with. My daughter is more destructive anyway, so she tends to dismantle the thing--and that's fun for her. She likes the penguins and the wheel. But no problems fitting the thing in the tub. There are ways to adjust it so it works, and no real problems with suction cups either."
2,Not the best toy ever,"The rope is frayed, destroyed, sitting on the floor, no where near the blue part. My small 8 month old dog pulled the rope out pretty easily. With a chopstick and luck I was able to get the rope back in but it never stayed. I gave up. The holes on the side aren't big enough for treats or to easily clean. The dog doesn't like chewing on the blue piece by itself. She does like dragging the dirty, frayed rope around and tossing it into the air. Prior to pulling the rope out, she liked to fling the toy around by the rope; be careful, the blue part hurts when it hits you in the head or shin. I wouldn't buy this again. A rope toy is 2 bucks, and if your dog doesn't like chewing on plastic parts, the blue part will be ignored as soon as it is separted from the rope."
4,My dog seems to like it.,"I still haven't found the right treat to use with this product, but I adapted. My dog seems to like it. It keeps her busy for a while. Seems resistant."
5,"In Death series, book 2","Great book. I really like the main characters, Eve and Roarke. They are people I can connect with and admire."
4,enjoyable,The book was very enjoyable to both me and my wife have recomended to others. We will continue to download Nora Roberts book to the Kindle
5,A great addition!!,"Eve Dallas once again has a murderer to catch. This time, the victims are all successful females that have families that mourn them. Once again the link between the victims is Eve's lover, they mysterious Roarke. However, this time she is doing all she can to clear him from her list of suspects. Roberts hooks the reader with the suspense as well as the ongoing romance between Roarke and Eve. Never having a family or very many friends, Eve is struggling with her relationship with Roarke. A part of her wants to keep a part of her life seperate if he ever leaves her, but a part of her wants to grab him with both hands and never let go.You will be hooked and shocked by the suspense part of the story. I was very surprised when the murderer was revealed, but once again, Even saves the day in a blaze of Glory."
2,Glory in Death,"As most of the J.D. Robb books I have read are excellent reading, I am just now starting to read ""Glory in Death). So far so good.More later."
5,Who is Eve Dallas?,"Eve Dallas searches in vain through most of the book for some hard evidence to reveal who is slashing the throats of high profile prominent women. It's wonderful to watch her live with Roarke and get used to the fact that he's there. She's comfortable with Mavis but seems to frequently wonder why. Feeny is always there and is one of the few constants in her life.I think the most revealing part of the book is when she asks herself. Who is Eve Dallas?She's really starting to remember what happened to her before she was found in the alley in Dallas and it truly frightens her as does her growing relationship with Dr. Mira, the Police psychologist."
5,Fantastic series !!,"Fantastic series and this is only book 2. I've read the whole series andI'm re-reading it now. The characters have great dynamic and mesh really well, atthis point they're slowing being introduced.I love the interaction with Eve and Roarke, and it gets better as the series continues.I highly recommend this series to those interested in romance and suspense."
3,Enjoyable.,"This book falls into the ""lite mystery and romance"" category-but probably will not rise to the top of of your favorites in either list.I may have enjoyed this more had I understood the history of Eve Dallas beyond the occasional reference. Still, I was interested enough in Eve's love/resistance of Roarke and the confirmation that I had guessed correctly as to Whodunit to honestly say I liked the book.The audio version is outstanding, however, and the voice of Roarke alone is well worth the listen. Enjoy!"
4,Satisfied customer.,This book shipped very fast so I was really pleased. It's an older book but the condition was fine. I'd use this seller again.
3,Love the series but too much romance,"I enjoy the futuristic setting of the Eve Dallas series, and undoubtedly will read (or listen to on audiobooks) every one. Every one I've read so far has kept my interest and been quite enjoyable. The only complaint I have with J.D. Robb's ""In Death"" series are the sex episodes with Eve and Rourke. Not from a morality standpoint, but they are just ridiculous and don't add anything to the book. I always find myself skipping over these parts because they are so far-fetched and over the top. I'm wanting to read a mystery book anyway, not a romance/sex novel. But the basic story has been good in all the Eve Dallas books I've read to date."
2,QUITE THE LETDOWN---,"This book mainly consisted of EVERYONE bitching at each other, over and over again, throughout the entire story--especially the hero and heroine. Wow! What a headache! The villain was obvious, especially if you have ever watched old McMillan and Wife reruns and the story just wasn't that enthralling. For me, it didn't live up to the first book and I'm afraid the rest of the series will be more like a bad soap opera than a good romantic mystery so I'm calling it quits here."
2,"Derivative detective, silly sci-fi","Folks, there's nothing here you haven't read many times before. The formula is (#) Hard-case ultra-competent ultra-pure detective (#) Self-doubts (#) Tough background / childhood (#) Powerful friend (#) Powerful antagonists (#) Maniacal killer (#) High school level sex scenes (#) High school level action scenes. Pour these standard ingredients into a laughably amateurish ""futuristic"" setting, to claim some distinction from all others using this recipe. Repeat 20 times. Yield: 20 ""bestsellers"".If all you want from a book is to have your time wasted, this will suffice. That must be why so many people gave it 4 or 5 stars. The attitude is ""of course it's nonsense, but what do you expect?"". Well, I want and expect a LOT more from a 4.5 star book. I could write this well myself! If it's junk, rate it as junk - and learn to tell the difference between drivel like this and a good book. All readers will benefit."
1,A Romance novel disguised as a mystery.,"I could only read about 3/4ths of this book before I put it down in disgust. The writer spends so much time on a truly ridiculous ""relationship"" that she totally ignores the mystery. Even I figured out who did it, and I didn't even care.This series needs to be reclassified and reshelved in the Romance aisle. If I wanted to read Romance novels, that's what I would buy."
5,Glory in Death,Nora has this thing about keeping her readers pinned to her books until finished and to heck with the housework
5,Good second installment,"2 books in this series in, and I have burnt the midnight oil this week to finish both. Great setting and three dimensional main characters. My concern is that I have come to this series late, with 30+ already written. Hope the quality doesn't drop off."
3,predictable yet very good!,"Roarke and Eve part 2!It was more predictable this second book of the In Death series but I enjoyed it just as much.There are more things we get to learn about Eve and I really like the way Roarke is trying to spoil her, i love his house and I really like the chemistry they share ( like is an understatement, I'm green with envy)! Mavis and Summerset are a couple made from heaven.Still planning to read no 3 after all there is a serious question left unanswered by the end of the book."
3,Not the best of the series,"I was not overly impressed by this one. It held little in the way of real plot. What keeps me reading, however, are the strong characters penned by Roberts (writing as J.D. Robb). You believe these characters and, as a result, fall deeply in love with them.With the benefit of having continued the series, I can now say I'm glad I braved this book. However, it wasn't one of the best... it felt like the characters were still trying to find themselves... to develop an identity... then again, maybe that's the point. In retrospect, I'm not certain."
4,I liked it!,2nd book in the series and I enjoyed it! I was a bit leary of the futuristic part of the series but it has been very enjoyable!!
5,Read it in 1 day!,"After Naked in Death, I had to run out and buy this one to see where the romance of Eve and Roarke lands. I'm baffled that Robb manages to keep the romance interesting through 2 novels, as I expect she will through the rest of the series (we'll see).Definately a good read! Love the mix of mystery and romance as I tend to get bored with romance novels alone. I highly recommend, but start it on a day when you can sleep in the next morning, as I found myself up late unable to put it down!"
2,JD Robb/Nora Roberts needs to learn how to write a mystery,"Just like NAKED IN DEATH and all the others in this series, it is really obvious who the killer is and what motivated them. When I am reading a real mystery I hardly ever guess who the killer is and certainly not what motivated them to kill. This writer needs to make a decision on what she wants to write. Romance or mystery. I certainly like romance in my stories, but she spends half the book on the relationship and gives us a very weak mystery plot because of it. Also, the average mystery writer writes 1-2 books a year, but Ms. Roberts writes 7-8 per year. In my book that makes her a hack!"
5,Exciting,I love this entire series!!! Kudos to The author. Its not to futuristic where you must spend time trying to figure out new wave lingo. Love it!!!
5,Great condition,"I just received my new (old) JD Robb book, which fills in the series for me. I was very happy with the timing of the shipping, the quality of the handling/packaging and the condition of the book. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this vendor again."
2,Not too pleasing,"This was used as our primary text book for two semesters of programming. Overall, it was relatively disappointing. The text is a good introductory text, as the reader progresses through the book, harder concepts become poorly explained. For example, his explanation on Object Oriented Programming is subpar. He relies more on definitions and less in explaining them, making abstracting OOP concepts more difficult. If you're new to C++ and have no background in programming, I would recommend this book up and until OOP, for that pick up another book."
2,Beat up book,"The actual content in the book is very good and teaches you programming with c++ very easily. But the company I bought it from listed it as a very good quality that that is the opposite of this book. It was underlined and highlighted on almost every page, it is very beat up, the book is ripped in half down the middle. Looks like it was in a few nuclear wars."
2,Table not as High as Advertised,"This TV Tray Table was advertised as 24 inches high, but was only 22. It is attractive, but if you try to sit and eat or work on it with the table above your lap, it would be too easily knocked over. The manufacturer would not admit this was defective, so beware the advertised dimensions before you order. Width and depth are as advertised, only the height is almost 2 inches lower than advertised. It's a shame, as such handy and lightweight tables are not as commonly available as they once were."
5,Easy Tv Tray,I actually wasn't sure what I was getting though when I got it it ended up being perfect for what I got it for. Easy to put together and sturdy. Good buy.
1,Goo-gah galore and not much more,"Nothing but how to over-decorate curb-side finds with glued on cutouts, thingys, and other junk. I suspect most readers could come up with these ideas themselves, and probably exercise more restraint! Also provides only minimal instruction about glue gunning. It would be more worthwhile to just wing it with ideas from other decorating books (like Christopher Lowell's)."
1,Not the best book for decorators,"The information in the book is the same information you can get for free on TLC or HGTV. Nothing new. The author shows many pictures of great looking furniture but in some of the more exotic pieces she doesn't share how she came about completing the project. I was not impressed by this book at all, especially with the knowledge that she has outside vendors cover her furniture and then she adds the trim to embelish a white cotton fabric. Well who can't do that. I recovered an entire couch in one day with numerous fabrics. I would not recommend, spend your money else where and get these tips from decorating shows for free."
2,Poor account of Chicago's bad,This is a poorly wriiten account of one turncoat in the world of Chicago crime. Nothing new here and for the most part it is a boring story that I could not finish.
3,"Chicago corruption: a deep look, but could have been better","Every Chicagoan knows they live in a cesspool of corruption. It's been that way for more than a century and will probably never change. Robert Cooley is obviously a brave man. He put his life at risk to expose corruption. Though he was once part of that corruption, he ultimately saw that the evil needed to be fought.That said, the book is disappointing. The writing style is flat and there is far too much focus on Cooley's childhood and personal life. Opportunities are missed time and time again to bring the corrosive effects of political and judicial corruption into sharper relief. Excursions into the impact of mob murders, fixed court cases and the like would have been welcome. Particularly for people who don't live in Chicago, the impact of Cooley's bravery on the people of the city may be lost.That said, Cooley's book is still worthwhile for demonstrating how a few dishonorable men can steal the life and wealth of a great city.Jerry"
5,"Nice, more so at night!","Great acid/ chill out beats, I just love all the cuts, they are so smooth and relaxed but with nice bass edge."
4,good watch,I like the angle; makes it much easier to read. Numbers don't need to be stretched - get the one w/ normal numbers. Buttons easy to use (not sticky like some). One bad thing: the battery needed changing after 1 month; must have been old. Work & sport watch; not fancy.
2,Sing In The Style of Usher,Songs on the CD are not good. Bad quality audio. Not worth the amount of money I paid for it.
2,Not so hot,"Star Fox 64 is a game that leaves much to be desired, this is partly because it is such an old game, but even at that, it still isnt so great; the gameplay is okay, but the replay value isn't so hot, after a few runs through the game, you get so good at it that it isn't really fun anymore, the sound isn't so great, and the graphics are horrible. My advice is don't waste your money"
5,BUY THIS GAME PLEASE!!!!!!!,This game ia amazing. The graphics are outta this world. The controls are pretty easy to learn if you go to training mode or you can just pick the controls up while playing the game! All the levels are when you are in a plane except for a few levels in a tank!! The main objective is to go through different levels intill you come to the level where you kick Andross's butt! You can upgrade your sheild by getting three gold rings and recover sheild by getting silver one. This game is DA' BOMB! Go Starfox 64!!!!!!!!
5,This Game is great!!!,I borrowed the game when i first bought my 64 and i couldn't stop playing it the graphics and pretty good and the game play is excellent. If you like the Star Wars movies you will definitly like this game.
3,Gets Old Quick,"This game is pretty entertaining for the first couple weeks that you have it. After that is doesn't really have much to offer. The game just gets really easy to beat and extremely repetitive with all the says of the various characters. Although the characters, with names like Slippy and Peppy, give some extra flavor to this boring game. Multiplayer mode is just plain bad. All of the escape moves make it too easy to dodge your opponents fire, so the game takes forever, and the multiplayer levels themselves offer you nothing interesting. This game does have it's value for a little while so if you want to try it then rent it, don't waste your money buying it."
3,Is this the 1997 version?,"My son likes starfox64, but the one he has is 1997 version. This one (Star Fox without Rumble Pak) was copyrighted by Gamesport for 1999... I am wondering if it is a newer version or not. The box, however, looks pretty much like the old one. Any tip is appreciated."
2,"Um, no.","I think it's too late to give a review on this game, but here goes. This is the most perverted game ever made. When you think about it, it's pretty disgusting. ""Aim for the open spot!"", ""I'll do you fast, Peppy old pal."", ""Fox, get this guy off me!"" ""I've got a present for ya!"" EEEEEEEEEUUU! Should kids be playing these games?Anyway, the gameplay is fun...for 15 minutes. Then it's bothersome, annoying, and dull. Your team mates have the worst A.I. ever, and they don't get power-ups. The game is horribly easy and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too short. Like, 30 minutes short. Also, the voice acting sucks.I hope Starfox Adventures will be good. This game shouldn't have started the whole Starfox thing. If so, it needed work."
3,an okay game,"this game is okay, i'm not really into this type of games, but this one ewas pretty good for it's type."
4,my review reflect how i felt at the time. starfox is great!,"It can be said that this game is easy, maybe the graphics is terrible but at the time i loved this game i've not touch this game in years however i can say i really enjoyed this all time classic.For the people who are true nitendo fans this is a classic that you can add to your 64 libary. I still have my 64 and it works great so does the games, Starfox is worth a try laterz folks."
4,Pretty good so far,"I recently bought this at Walmart for 9 bucks, so for that price this is an awesome product. An earlier reviewer said something about AAA batteries being small and not fitting in the charger, but there is a switch on the side that moves the top part lower so it CAN charge both types (duh!) The batteries do get warm when charging, but thats normal (especially for such a fast charger). So far so good, but I've only charged the batteries a couple of times."
1,Tipping Point vs. Tipping Point,"There are two books entitled ""Tipping Point"". This book by Fred Marchant is a book of poetry which won the 1993 Word Works Washington Prize.The ""Tipping Point"" (How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference) by Malcolm Gladwell is a different book which discusses how little changes can have big effects; when small numbers of people start behaving differently, that behavior can ripple outward until a critical mass or ""tipping point"" is reached (explaining the successful reversal of crime patterns in New York City).Reviews, however, often confuse the two books (my rating of this book reflects the fact that a confused reviewer led me to the wrong book and is no reflection on the Fred Marchant's poetry; Amazon does not allow an ""--"" rating)."
5,A lush and sensual introduction to a gifted artist,"A big book overflowing with big ideas as conceived and breathed life into by America's most unique theatre artist. This is a volume to read, to reread, to spark your imagination and to put on your coffee table to look at the cool pictures. The only thing more you could wish for is if Julie herself could make a home visit when you bought the book"
3,No info on sizes,"These pads, for the elbows and the knees are well made and appear to be long lasting. I would have given them 5 stars, but the flaw I found is that there is no way to know what age the sizes fit. Is the small size for 4 to 6 years old?, or is the medium for a specific age range? These pads are supposed to be for children, but it is impossible to know how they will fit your child, you have to just guess and hope you chose the correct size."
3,Sizing difficult to determine,"The pads themselves were okay, but ended up being to big. Some go by age and others size. Would be nice to know measurements they fit as these were the right age group, but too large."
3,it looks good but not the right size,"when i saw the size ""medium"", I expected it to be medium adult size. but this product is for kids. I dont know the quality cuz i haven't used it."
3,Movie,The movie itself was good but the playback was at times intermittent and left my kids frustrated. Hopefully the next movie we order will have better playback.
4,Excellent Survey of the British Army,"The author is a good, solid, if uninspired craftsman. He presents a fine, easily readable, survey of the British army including weapons, tactics, officers and men. He is not Chandler or Elting in terms of style, but presents plenty of information. Its a bit like British cooking; a bit heavy, not always tasty, but it fills you up and you dont go away hungry."
3,Solar racer kit,"It works, but is a lot smaller than I expected. I have to pay more attention to the specs next time."
4,Surprisingly good,"I really enjoyed this book. I was craving to get away from the 'innocent virgin' genre and this fit the bill.I liked the chemistry between the protagonists, hate at first sight is a big 'yawn' but this was written in a tolerable way. If you are looking for Stephanie Laurens type bedroom scnese, don't hold your breath as this book is surprisingly conservative in that vein.The main characters were credible, the supporting characters I also liked and they are more fleshed out than in most books. All in all a great diversion for a Saturday afternoon when you are sick in bed."
5,What a Terrific Read!!!,"Alex and Lily's story was fantastic! I loved it! Lily was very independent and head-strong and Alex was absolutely yummy!! I can't wait to read Derek Craven's story. I would, however, like to see a story with Lily's daughter, Nicole, and Alex's brother, Henry. So maybe one day Ms. Kleypas will finish this charming series with a story for Nicole and Henry."
5,KOKO,LOVED THIS BOOK HAD TO GET MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR. THE PLOT AND THE ROMANCE WAS SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO KEEP READING.
4,then came you by lisa kleypas,"then came you by lisa kleypas, good book, a woman tries to stop her sister from marrying a man who she's reallyinterested in. can she plot to make it happen and live with the consequences. and there's a twist, something that happened in the past resurfaces."
3,She wanted to be rescued... so much for strong willed women...,"First of all, I do agree with most of the reviews... the characters are well developed and are fascinating. My mayor regret if with the female main character: Lily. For someone who wanted to be ""free"" and independent she came too soft and easily submissive. I hate it. I would understand that the alpha male was as gorgous as Apolo himself. No problem with that. But when a woman has a strong personality and wants to keep a male at bay, she does no matter what. Lily had several oportunities to keep Alex at bay and didn't take them. Really disappointing. I would have rooted for a lot of serious Alex angst. Then she saving his heart. Now that would have been TOTAL win."
3,Went downhill,"I was enjoying this Kleypas quite a bit. The heroine is very engaging and has an interesting past. But then it just went off the deep end for me. I don't understand the point of writing such a strong, intelligent heroine who could be an equal to this capable hero... and then have him saying that she should be spanked! (yuck! like a child?) And carrying her out of a room against her will, humiliating her and treating her not at all like an equal would deserve. It just really killed the romance for me, how he started wanting to be ""obeyed"" and to manage what she could and couldn't do. That just really didn't work for me, after that kind of set up-- even if this is a Regency, this is a woman who hunts and gambles like a man, with real platonic male friends and a desire be respected and treated like an adult. A heroine like that, I can't see her being happy long term with that sort of marriage. I've liked some of Kleypas' other romances, but this one didn't work for me."
4,Magnificent!,"The book is very good. It has a good plot, with twists to not make it an ordinary book. The characters blend very well, although the same characters' personalities from book to book could be better kept.Overall, very good. Lisa Kleypas has done another great job. :)"
1,Heroine Was Completely Annoying,"I was very disappointed with this book. My main problem with the book was Lilly, the heroine. She was so reckless that I just couldn't relate to or sympathize with her. Also, many parts of the plot were unrealistic. For example, after a long estrangement with her family, they forgive her at the doorstep of their rich future son-in-law. Her mother is described as a social climber, yet she doesn't seem to care that Lilly's reckless and scandalous behaviour may taint their younger daughter and jeopardize her ability to marry the rich aristocrat. They just accept her into the fold weeks before Lilly's sister's wedding. It was also hard to believe that society would so easily accept Lilly after learning about her child out of wedlock and her purported liason with Derek Craven.The only positive part of the book was Derek Craven. After reading this book, I wanted to read more about him."
2,Then Came You,"I cannot believe these reviews. I bought this book because of them, I was a little more than disappointed. I love a tortured hero. THe plot had alot of possiblitlies. It was simply the writing. Absolutely elementary level. I'm so sorry but others purchasing this book deserve to know. I gave her 2 stars for getting published. That was truly an accomplishment."
1,Barrel scraping,"I gave this book one star only because there was no option for giving it zero. By page 83 I hated it but I kept plowing on hoping the book would redeem itself eventually. At page 151 it went into the garbage. Why do so few authors know how to create a heroine who is assertive without falling into a morass of obnoxious? She's supposed to be spirited not an overweening shrew. The reader should admire her not want to pour her into a pair of cement overshoes and dump her worthless fanny, regardless of how attractive, into the Thames. Lily Lawson is not a sympathetic character; she's a harridan. No more Lisa Kleypas for me."
1,Skip this one,"I've read everything by Kleypas, she is a wonderful writer. Her heros are masterly and her heroines are sublime. I don't know what happened her. The heroine is a shrew who needs to have a serious behind kicking. Half way through the book I was hoping Alex would choose someone else."
2,"Definitely, Not 1 of Ms. Kleypas's Best!","Some of Ms. Kleypas's books R written very beautifully & relatebly, but sadly, this just isn't 1 of them...."
2,ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITES,"I really do like most of Lisa Kleypas' books, but this is one of my least favorites. The heroine is so depressing and self destructive. Don't bother with this one. It doesn't seem to have the charm and warmth that you get from other Kleypas books"
3,Not as god as the sequel!,"Having read this book's sequel, DREAMING OF YOU, I fully expected to love THEN CAME YOU. However, I am glad that I read the second book first for had I not, I probably never would have bothered to pick up DREAMING OF YOU. Here are the problems that I just couldn't get passed in this book: 1.) How is it that Derek Craven (being the richest, most powerful man in England) couldn't find the daughter? 2.) Why didn't Lily borrow the money from her family? I also had trouble believing that Derek wouldn't have lent the money to Lily. It seems like to much of this plot was contrived."
4,Wonderful book...,"Alex is a great endearing hero, honorable and loving. Lily is a very interesting heroine and went through a great deal. The care and patience Alex has for Lily is so sweet, and it's very satisfying to watch Lily grow into the role of a loving wife. I don't know what people mean in saying the first half of the book was boring, it was the best part! There were some hilariously angry scenes between Lily and Alex when they first meet, and the adorable Henry (Alex's little brother) adds a great touch. It's a remarkable show of Kleypas' skills that despite the very implausible plot twists (easy acceptance of Lily by her parents, her scandalous behaviors, and society's attitude about it) that I happily went along with it: it's clear Kleypas is focused on the emotional plausibility of the relationship. A really great read!"
5,Great read!!,"This is the second book by Lisa Kleypas that I have read and love this one too! I love finding new authors that really capture my heart. This book get a little crazy in the middle, but overall I loved it!! This one is definately a keeper!!"
5,great book,"What a great book. Strong hero gentleman, strong leading lady. All of the characters were well developed helping you to identify with each one. This was my first Lisa Kleypas book but will not be my last. I purchased several of her contemporary works after reading this book."
3,"good hero, ridiculous heroine",I really enjoyed the plot and cadence of this book. And the hero Derek is wonderful. But i did not like Miss Sarah at all. Her character is suddenly and weirdly changed. A proper society miss scared of men turning into a 'woman of the world' who knows how to flirt in a single night is ridiculous. I understand it is a romance but this female characterization is shoddy at best and put me off completely.
5,great tea,I love this tea company they make great stuff...Although a lot of their teas are great this is one of my favorites...I drink 3 cups of this stuff and feel great...highly recommended...
5,Postmodern malaise,"A fantastic book that chronicles the malaise of living in 1990s America. Aimless, jobless, visionless, the protaganist trudges through an increasingly pointless life, involved in a realtionship that is already over and with no purpose in life to draw strength from.Unlike most of the self-absobed pretentious dreck being produced by young authors today, this book is a stunningly realistic portrayal of the depression that we all feel as what we could be turns into what we didn't become."
2,but why?,"I'm left wondering why. Why put these stories together when there's no point to them, no sense of intention? Why is the main character so 2-dimensional? Is he depressed or is he just a shadow of an author afraid of having a voice? There is no willingness to reveal him (the author, the character) which leaves the stories flat and boring. I'm from New Jersey and I was hoping to sink my teeth into this but it failed me."
2,Not that great...,"These flashcards did not stand up to my expectations. I hoped to strengthen my vocabulary but half of the words turned out to be way too easy. Some of these useless words include: fragile, moderate, flaw, sociable, stern, defiant, cunning, exception. The math and writing cards turned out okay, but really, I wouldn't recommend buying this product if you already own an SAT Study Guide."
2,What happened to Kaplan,"Since I used Kaplan flash card in 1990's it was great and effective, but with this new product, I don't know what happened, the quality of the card are very bad, and they are so small and need a lot of effort to read it."
2,Not for moving to Oahu! (don't judge a book by it's cover),"This book is poorly edited, and looks like it was printed in someone's garage. No less than three different font types throughout the main text. Additionally, the title of this book is deceiving- it should be called, the secrets to an affordable life on ""THE BIG ISLAND"" of Hawaii. The author says straight up on the second page of this book that this book will not help you if you want to move to Maui or any other Hawaii'an island for that matter. However, from reading the cover, it says nothing about referring to 'Hawaii'' as the Big Island of Hawaii. It just refers to 'Hawaii.' Annoying. Bad on me for not reading further- Amazon recommended this to me when I was purchasing another book on Hawaii, and I fell for it. Not satisfied."
5,VERY INFORMATIVE,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK FOR THINKING OF MOVING TO HAWAII.BUT PLEASE NOTE IT PERTAINS TO THE BIG ISLAND ONLY.I LIKED THE AUTHORS WAY OF EXPLAINING CERTAIN CUSTOMS AND I THROUGHLY ENJOYED THE BOOK.
1,Save your money folks,Written it appears some 30+ years ago including the book's photographs that are all poorly taken and quite old.
5,Great Resource!,"Great resource for anyone looking to relocate to live in the tropical islands of Hawaii.....gives lots of insider stuff that can cost you tons of extra cash, not to mention more headache! You won't be disappointed!"
5,the best of Dean Martin,"I just loved this cd, it was better then I thought, even if you are not a Dean Martin fan you would love this cd, the seller of this cd was reaaly nice too I'm so glad I bought this cd,I love all the songsLinda"
5,I love this CD,"I was surprised how much I loved the music on this CD and how much I remembered. I guess I heard my parents playing it when I was little. I especially like Amore and Volare. What can be better than ""When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, thats amore."" Dean Martin has a rich romantic voice. I think he is much better than Frank Sinatra. The only bad cut on this CD is the 1st one which is a folksy Kingston Trio type number that doesn't fit with Martin's voice but it is easy to skip that track. The rest is great."
1,Dean Martin CD (used),Unfortunately the CD must have been defective because it was unplayable. Seller could not replace it because it was the only one in stock. Seller did offer choice of another title of comparable value.
4,"""Memories are made of this"".","This seems to be a budget collection of sorts, but as far as song selection goes, all the big ones are on here. It's roughly the same as his other ""hits"" discs. ""That's Amore"", ""Return to Me"", and ""You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You"" are all on here, as well as nine others. The first half of this is classic Dean. It's such a refreshing thing to put on after listening to alot of the junk on the radio. I would say if there's one thing you need with your next martini, it's this cd. It will go great with your ""Frank"" and ""Tony"" cd's too."
2,More Ballet World,"This book is even more dragging than 'Dancing on My Grave'. As a matter of fact, about one third way through, I did not finish it. Again I think she could have had an interesting story that would hold one spellbound. It's again disappointing with technicalities and too much rambling.Maybe she will come up with a third book with a different writer."
2,AMERICAN CITIES,"This is a very mediocre book with grainy images that look like some of the exact same photos I've seen in other books, I mean the EXACT same photos. The text reads like a chamber of commerce pamplet, absolutely no research or thought went into the blurb on each city, I mean if you don't know that Cleveland has the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame you must be living under a shell, it's that basic and each city gets barely a glace. I read the previous reviews and I just wonder how many books of this kind they have seen because this one is average at best. If you happen to find it in the bargain section at Border's for five dollars, then I recommend you picking it up, but if not, just flip through it and leave it where you found it."
4,"It's true - real facts, real theory, and predictions","This is possibly the most important marketing book ever written on buyer behaviour. It describes predictable patterns in repeat-buying behaviour that have been shown to apply across hundreds of product categories, countries and time.But it is a hard read with far too much time spent on technical detail. It is a useful resource for researchers (especially research degree students working on brand loyalty) but managers would be better off tracking down some of Ehrenberg's more recent journal publications or reports from his 'R&D Initiative'.PS The book is out of print but is largely available from the Journal of Empirical Generalisations in Marketing Science."
4,Hands Up If You're A Geek!,"I'm probably the first and last person to visit this page. Sorry, Prof Ehrenberg, but if you wanted lots of sycophants to review your book you should have written ""The English Patient"" or something.That said, this is a great book, if you're a geek. Andy and his colleagues have spent DECADES researching consumer behaviour and how it can be predicted. Their NBD and Dirichlet model does this very well and well done to them. At least they haven't completely wasted their time.Doyens of high-brow journals such as the Journal of Marketing Research and The Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, it is surprising that their work is not common knowledge among FMCG marketers and managers, particularly as it has important messages relating to the current hot potato of customer loyalty.Never mind William S. Burroughs, this guy will do your head in"
5,Helps with Fibromyalgia!,"This herb/nutritional suppliment has improved my life! I take one or two droppers before bed-time, and have a wonderful night of sleep. Before I took this suppliment, I had tried many different medicines my doctor gave me - all of which had awful side-effects. If you have Fibromyalgia, with pain and sleeplessness, I recommed that you ask your Rheumatologist if this suppliment can help you."
5,Couldn't live without it,One of our two kids frequently has trouble falling asleep and we'd tried sleepy tea and other stuff but it never really worked. This stuff does the trick nine times out of ten. It has a strong alcohol taste but the kids don't mind since it helps them get to sleep. We keep it stocked at all times!
3,Works but taste not well for kids or adults,Works well as a liquid but the strong medicine taste did not suite our family. But a good value to buy in a larger quantity and just refill the smaller bottles for kids.
4,califyank,"I have two children which progressively had difficulty going to bed, their ages are 8 and 9. They would stay up several hours after their normal bed time of 9 pm. Our pediatrician suggested trying liquid melatonin rather than the pill for ease of administration. The melatonin works effectively, within an hour both of them are usually ready for bed. I have used the product for about 18 months and am very satisfied with the results. And, I have not observed any deleterious side effects. The dosage has been about one teaspoons per day."
4,Can't sleep? This might work.,"If you have trouble getting to sleep at night, this just might be what you need. Because it's liquid, it goes to work much faster than a pill. I usually feel drowsy within 20-30 minutes of taking it. Excellent alternative to prescription sleep aids for some."
3,I works!!!,This product definitely helps on those nights when a little bit of assistance in going to sleep is needed
5,good stuff but instead of 10 bottles i was only shipped 9,this stuff really works great instead of sleeping pills and works fast recomend it highly
3,okay,Although this product does help to improve sleep and eliminate night terrors in my kids it is too expensive and you have to give too much to get the right dose. I will just use the pills in the future.
1,Gross!,My son almost threw up when I gave this to him! It smells and tastes like alcohol. I don't know what I'm going to do with the rest of the bottle...
2,This company has horrible C/S,"When I ordered this product, it said it was in stock. It took 10 days to ship, instead of 3-5 like it said! Turns out they were back-ordered.I repeatedly asked to cancel my order. I stated over and over through e-mails that I did not want, or need it anymore. My requests were ignored. Then, I finally get an e-mail telling me that my order was picked up, and they did not get my request to cancel before it was picked up. THIS IS FALSE. So now I am waiting on yet another e-mail from the compnay telling me how to return my product... which finally arrived yesterday. Almost 3 weeks after I ordered."
1,Contains Ethyl Alcohol,"I have an Autistic 5 year old son that has problems sleeping at night on occasions. I bought the liquid melatonin because I can't get him to swallow a pill. I've tried to crush the pills and mix it in his juice, but doesn't like the gritty taste.I thought a liquid solution of melatonin would do the trick. However, the 2nd ingredient in this product (after water) is Ethyl Alcohol. I would not recommend giving this product to a child."
3,"seems ok, but ineffective for purpose purchased","this product was purchased for alleviating the symptoms of adrenal disease in my ferret, it has seemed to be ineffective. I do not blame the product but the advanced case in the animal. It would have been nice to have seen more accurate dosage info on the product (i.e., how many doses per bottle) and would also have been nice to have had less flavor additives."
1,BEWARE Alcoholics Anonymous THIS STUFF WILL GET YOU RIPPED!!!,"THIS IS A SHAM - IT IS FULL OF ALCOHOL - IT WILL GET YOUR KIDS DRUNK!!!Get Mel-O-Drop here...Maxi-Health Research Mel-O-Drop Melatonin Liquid, 2 ozThis is what you want - it is ALCOHOL FREE - GOING TO SLEEP DRUNK & STUPID IS NO WAY TO GET A DEEP SLEEP - NOTICE THE OMISSION OF THE WORD ALCOHOL IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION - USE THE MEL-O-DROP it is safe for kids :) I use Mel-O-Drops and it works - Just remember more than three droppers is overkill - too much - let the melatonin work on your system for a few days ... peace"
2,Taste like liquor,"The taste is awful, I gave it 2 stars because it works but there are better products that taste good and work the same."
2,Not what it seems,"As with the other bottle,this item did not work as advertised for us. It also was not flavored. It was the same as the regular bottle. I was very disappointed with the outcome but had to try it at least just to see if what everyone else said would also help us."
1,Don't Be Fooled By The Size,"I use Melatonin to fall asleep at night. I normally go through a bottle a month. When I saw this 8 ounce bottle I thought I'd found a great way to save money......I was wrong. And that's because Natrol significantly dilutes the Melatonin. Their recommended dose is 400% larger than other packages because its mostly water. I found that dose wasn't sufficient and it took about 5 sleepless nights to get the right dose, which is roughly 30 mL. Normally I need 2 mL.This company has made the worst kind of mistake; they think their customers are stupid and mathematically challenged. They'd make more money by making a superior product with better packaging. Instead, they've made the worst kind of cynical decision: they pretend their product is more when actually it is less.I'll finish my bottle of their junk and then I'll never buy from them again. And that means ANY product they manufacture. Goodbye Natrol!"
1,Beware ingredients!,"Ethyl alcohol is the second ingredient on the bottle, and it tastes like you are drinking rubbing alcohol. There are better alternatives without needing to subject anyone to drinking this. This is a case where cost should not win out, especially if you are using for children (unless you are trying to build a high tolerance to alcohol intake at a young age). Ugh."
2,Ineffective,Unfortunately for me this product did not seem to have any affect whatsoever.I was really hoping this would help me fall asleep but it did not.
5,Melatonin for my ferrets,"Have been using this to treat symptoms of adrenal gland failure in my two ferrets. It is working extremely well. I put it in their water to equal 1 ML per day. It is easy to use, easy to dose and other than the plastic measuring caps being broken and unusable, it is great."
5,Goodbye sleepless nights!,"If you or your child struggle with getting to sleep, this is the product for you. If the taste isn't pleasant to you (it does have a ""fruity"" flavor) you can mix it into applesauce and it blends quite nicely. It works especially well for children who have ADHD and struggle with settling in. It doesn't help with wakings in the night though, just getting off to sleep. At least that's what we've found. It's not recommended for long term use, at least as far as the research I've read, but it's great for breaking bad patterns and creating good sleep hygeine."
1,Caution this contains Alcohol,"I ordered this liquid Melatonin because it was suggested by someone else with a toddler who has difficulty winding down and going to bed at night. I was excited because she said it really did work....however when I received the product and looked at this label I saw it contains ALCOHOL...duh that would make any child sleep. Ever heard of people giving their kids Nyquil...cough syrup, etc to make them sleep. I for one do not want to give alcohol in any form to my little girl, so the bottle went into the drawer for me or my husband to use ourselves if we ever have trouble sleeping. Beware because this did not show up on the description online. I do see that lots of parents that are using this and praising it highly, have children with conditions such as autism...I am not judging them at all, it is hard enough dealing with a ""normal"" child who has trouble sleeping...I cannot imagine what they go through and God Bless anything that helps out even a little bit."
2,never worked,never worked for me i've had others that worked for me and the taste better than this one. this i won't be buying again.
4,light at the end of the tunnel?,"are things looking up for lanegan? not really. but it hasn't gotten any worse either. Thats the feel of this record. The somewhat sinister feel of 'hospital roll call' is balanced by slow crooner's like 'wheels'. Then theres the closer, 'because of this' that turns the mood of the music up to then on its ear. A cool song with a great finish but it just doesn't seem to fit with the other 9 tracks. Sounds very treeish. All in all, a solid effort from one of the more realistic observers to emerge from the decayed seattle gunge scene."
4,One Good Album,"One huge reason anyone should buy this record, is for the song ""Because of This."" That is one of his best songs..."
2,ugh,I tried so many times like it. This isthe same guy from screaming trees? it was a forced attempt. Sorry
5,A familiar old friend of a classic children's book,"As luck would have it, I actually have my copy of Mr. Pudgins. I believe that my mother bought it at a garage sale in the 70's. I remember reading this wonderful book many times over. Now that I have daughters of my own, I've read them Mr. Pudgins, and it is the one book that they listen to with incredible attention. I feel very fortunate, as my copy is only beginning to lose the cover; I will move to get it repaired by tape or some other means immediately.I had thought that this book was gone, but when my parents divorced a few years ago it was still there at the old house in a box. What a great feeling to find it again.As for the actual story of Mr. Pudgins, it is a delightful work that all ages of children can enjoy. The text is very easy to read aloud, and there are enough pictures to keep littler ones like my 4 year old interested. Very lively story, and well done.Please add my name to those wishing a reprint of this book."
5,Fantasy fun for kids -- and Kids at Heart,"THIS BOOK WAS XLENT!!!! I read it at school as a little girl. Now I'm a grownup lady, but part of me is Peter Pan's twin sister, and who couldn't love Mary Poppins in a male version! Marshmallow-eating bears and Root Beer faucets! HURRAY! I recommend it for kids and for the kid in everyone! It's too bad it's Out Of Print! I wish I could give it 10 stars!"
5,The one special book of a childhood!,"I have searched book stores for years (literally) for Mr. Pudgins. Of all the books I read during my childhood, Mr. Pudgins sparked my imagination and curiosity. Even today, over 30 years later, I still can hardly contain my excitement when I first open a new book. I believe that water can come out of a faucet tasting like grape or orange soda and I think that dodo birds can live in my car trunk. Mr. Pudgins is not available to my 11 year old son, and that makes me sad."
5,This book needs to be reprinted,"I read this book several years ago and really enjoyed it. Recently I went through a box of books to find that most were water damaged, beyond repair. Unfortunately, this book was one of the victims. I recommend it to those who enjoy fantasy- and encourage publishers to reprint it."
5,"This is a great book, PLEASE REPRINT IT!!","I am a librarian in a small city and have read thousands of books over the years. Even though I read this book as a child, I still remember everything about this book vividly. It is so very wonderful, and funny. I would recommend it to any person who has or knows kids. The ideas in the story are hilarious and extremely original. I have never seen them anywhere else. A dodo bird, faucets that pour soda pop, driving the car *on* a lake are only a few of the fun times that you will have with this book. I would say that this would appeal to anyone who has enjoyed Pippi Longstocking. Get it and read it if you can!"
5,This book is one of my top five favorites from my childhood.,"I seem to be like many other readers of Mr. Pudgins; I hoped that my parents would find a babysitter as magical and fun as Mr. Pudgins. My favorite parts include the soda from the faucets and the train that blew real smoke. The story reminded me of a male Mary Poppins, another of my favorite stories. I have been searching for a copy of this book for several years myself and was very disappointed to find that it was no longer in print. Along with your other customers, I would strongly urge any publishing company to reprint this wonderful book. Then, once again this magical story would be available to another generation of children!"
3,X-men 2,okay i only gave 3 stars because i read the 1st book and thoght it was great then i thought i would read the 2nd book so i tried it but theres a lot of big words and seemed more of an adult book than a teen book.
4,X-Men 2,The book is a real surprise and i know it will be that way to whoever reads it including the X-men fans. The plot is far better than the previous story. It is more intense and action filled.The villians are more evil than Magneto was in the first story. It has a lot of surprises and gives a sense that people can be together no matter who or what they are.I enjoyed it a lot and i hope that whoever reads the book after me will come to the same conclusion or at least acknowledge that it was the best X-men story so far that has been written. The book is 408 pages long and I hope people don't complain about its lenght.
4,Not all that bad . . .,"I normally hate novelizations, but after seeing the movie (which i loved) i decided to try the novelization. I was happy to see that it had more than 150 pages, as most novelizations do. It was a substantial book and well-written. I like detail and depth and claremont does a great job in that area.Now, for some reason, the endings don't match up. I suppose Singer made a change, and for the better i think. The movie ending creates more of a teaser for the (hopefully) next movie. The book ending was a bit boring and didn't really lead anywhere. But if you want to get another view of the characters and more insight into the movie, this book is a worthwhile buy"
2,Material is not what was expected,"I purchased this for my 10 week old mini australian shepherd and it didn't last a week. Had I known the material was not as strong I would have purchased something more durable. For a puppy that likes to chew, he has chewed through two balls already. The ring on the other hand seems to be well made and has not had any tears yet."
4,good for what it is,"As some have already asserted, this is not the music you'd expect from the funk/ fusion Roy Ayers of Mystic Voyage. This album is a whole other kind of beast. Ayers and band do lay down the funk, but without electric instruments and effects that can actually overpower the musical element. Hancock always comes through with strong solos and Ayers' improvisation on ""Wave"" is nothing short of ecstacy. If anything, it suffers from songs that are a little too long and a disk that is way too short. Lush orchestration and top-notch musicianship are the staples that make this LP a solid effort."
2,Not really a picnic at all!!,"An early Atlantic production by Herbie Mann re-released by the normally tasteful 32 records.If you're familiar with the work that Ayers went on to do in the seventies then listening to this will come as a great disappointment.The main problem seems to have been an unwillingness to edit or deny players the right to solo. So a couple of the tracks ""What the people say""(8.09) and ""Wave""(7.59) are overlong. A couple of the compositions are weak- ""A rose for Cindy"" is not classic Ayers, and ""Lil's paradise"" was probably included because composer Charles Tolliver is the trumpet/flugel on the session.Somehow the presence of Herbie Hancock on piano,and Hubert Laws on flute doesn't save the session. There IS some good ensemble playing but the whole album is uneven and not representative of what Roy Ayers went on to do later."
5,The Best Ever!!,"This is the swetest soundtrack ever. If you have never been a big Aerosmith fan, you will be one after hearing this. It is so romantic! The slow sweet lyrics are so amazing you will want to listen to them over and over again."
1,not what I wanted,I was looking for the REAL SOUNDTRACK of the entire movie. This only has a couple of tracks that sound like the movie. Never heard any of the other tracks in the movie
3,"Buenas canciones pero, y la banda de sonido?","Compre este CD buscando la excelente musica orquestal que en la pelicula aparece. Pero al escucharlo solo encontre una de este tipo, las demas eran canciones de Aertosmith y otras bandas (que igualmente no son malas). Creo que deberia haber sido incluida la banda de sonido del film (como es de costumbre), ya que esta es de muy buena calidad, y es de interes a muchas personas . Espero que pronto salga una version con lo que en la primera falta. Mientras tanto le doy a este album 3 estrellas."
4,Sehr gut!!!,"Da auch ein Jon Bon Jovi Lied drauf ist, und die Rocker von Aerosmith eine Glanzleistung ableifern, bleibt ein hervorragender Soundtrack, welcher durch einige shit-songs versaut wird."
5,Don't wanna miss a thing is a superb theme...,I recommend this CD because the Aerosmith guys have done a well job touching our sensitive part of the heart. Just hug your girlfriend/boyfriend and listen to it... it'll work great!
3,decent,There are a few decent Aerosmith tracks on the album. The score is probably the highlight of the album.
3,"Score one point for pop culture, -10 for rock n' roll...","This was a good soundtrack...if you like poppy power ballads. Aerosmith has their old songs like ""Sweet Emotion"" and ""Come Together"", but has added a few songs to their collection of hits with ""Don't Want to Miss a Thing"". Not that ""Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" is a bad song, it just strangely has that 80's hairband-esque feel to it...You know, one of those sappy love songs that make chicks scream and men gag. The rest of the original compositions on the album aren't that bad either, considering they're all pop culture songs made to sell a movie, not to actually have meaning to them.It's a good CD if you like pop rock, but if you want your Aerosmith rockin' like I do, it's not the CD for you then."
2,Nice. Just don't listen to it more than once.,"I was really enthusiastic about this cd after I listened to it the first time. After that, it got worse and worse each time and the songs sounded stupider and stupider. Leaving on a Jet Plane remains fairly listenable though."
2,What is this?,"There are a few awesome songs on this CD, but the overall play of this CD is not the best. The various artists have done great with the lyrics in each of the songs, but some of them are not substatial. A good CD to buy, but only if you are collecting soundtracks."
2,areosmith is getting really old really fast!!!!,"the CD was good at first with ""i don't wanna miss a thing"" and 3 more areosmith songs + an our lady peace song (which is the best. but after a while they got realllyyy old except ""starseed"" by our lady peace. i got so sick of it that i broke the CD in 4 pieces"
5,What a great Soundtrack!,"This soundtrack was the best soundtrack I have ever heard! I liked every song except one or two of them. For all the people who like aerosmith and the movie armegeddon, this cd is a must!"
3,fan from peterborough-ontario-canada,the only good songs are leavin on a jet plane and dont wanna miss a thing.other than that it sux.
2,Crappy Songz and Lyricz,"Armageddon was a great movie, but when I got the CD, it's bad! I didnt really pay that much attention to the music when the movie was going on cuz it was so good, kinda..but then, when i really get to listen to the dumb CD, only the theme song(track13) and I dont wanna miss a thing were good..the rest are garbage! I mean garbage! Final note, the lyric i dun wanna miss a thing was good but i wished it had sang by another artist...aerosmith is lame."
4,one-hit wonder,"Quite frankly, the only reason I bought this CD was cause of Aerosmith's I Don't Want to Miss A Thing, which is by far the best song on here. The rest of the songs (including the other three Aerosmith songs and the cover by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith) are just filler."
1,very Bland,I used to really Like AeroSmith but after they Signed the contracts for all that Money their Music went downhill fast.this disc is very much a AeroSmith disc.even though there other artists featured this is there disc.and it's too sappy and Predictable.I Don't want to miss a thing is boring.what happen to there edge?
5,The Best,I really liked this soundtrack. I really liked the songs and artists on the cd/tape.I hope a lot of other people like this soundtrack as much as I did.
5,ARMA-AWESOME,Everytime I play this soundtrack it stirs the same feelings that the movie does. The movie is an awesome ride and is complimented by the variety of music and artists. Great job was done by the Tyler's and everyone else. A BIG FIVE STARS !!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Great combo of different artists, especially AEROSMITH","The Aerosmith songs on here are the best, and a great soundtrack seems to have a big effect on me. This is how I got introduced to Aerosmith. You gotta get this CD... not only does it have Aerosmith, but it's also got ZZ Top and Our Lady Peace, buy it!"
4,A Very Good Soundtrack,"A good soundtrack to a good movie. There are only 4 Aerosmith songs, but two of them are all-time classics ""Sweet Emotion"" (one of the best versions available) and ""Come Together"". Of course it also contains the two new songs ""What Kind of Love Are You On?"" a good song that was an outtake from Nine Lives and ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"". The latter is mostly what sold this album and it's not a typical song for the band. It's a ballad, but different from their previous ones, due to the fact it was written by renowned pop songwriter Diane Warren and Perry's guitar does not stick out that much on it. It's not one of the band's better songs, but in live performances it is much better and more Aerosmith sounding. I would buy this. Good songs by other bands include the ZZ Top classic Lagrange, Journey's new sound with Remember Me, and the Armageddon score."
4,I hope the movie lives up to the soundtrack!,"You have got to love the fact that Aerosmith has been making music for a very long time - and they don't disappoint their fans with this one. Bon Jovi, Bob Seger and the rest make this a cool CD to add to your collection - I just hope the movie lives up to my expectations based on what I am listening to in the car, at work and at home! What Kind of Love Are You On should become a classic Aerosmith tune - Steven Tyler and company haven't sold out with their ballads...THEY STILL KNOW HOW TO ROCK N' ROLL."
5,Excellent!! One of my faves!,"Everytime I listen to this CD (esp. the Aerosmith's, ""Don't Want to Miss a Thing,"" I get all teary eyed and remember different scenes from the movie (which was also great...). I recommend it to anyone."
3,Best of...not good enough,"Over all, this CD is kind of a boring let-down. A couple tedious songs, and a couple that are not really listenable.I knew a few of their most popular songs (Pride of Man, What about Me, Fresh Air, etc) but did not recall they did ""Who Do You Love"", so I'm off to get the extended version on ""Happy Trails"":-)"
2,pointless review,"Seems pointless to write a review of an album that appears to be out-of-print, but Marketplace buyers should know that this album is only 51 minutes long. There was ample space to put the long version of ""Who Do You Love?""."
2,Non Slip Mat?,"I was very disapointed in this tub mat, the suction cups do not grip no matter how hard you press down. It slips when getting in or out of the tub."
5,A Must-Read!,"For those interested in the philosophy of existential phenomenology, I highly recommend this book. This book is an abridgement of William Luijpen's ""Existential Phenomenology"". This edition is necessary since the book from which it came is quite dense and not easily understandable. But this does not take the challenge from the book. Although this is a relatively easier read, it is still full of wonderful insights on the nature of existential phenomenology. With the topics ranging from existence, love, hate and freedom, and discussions on the ideas of Heidegger, Sartre, and other phenomenologists and existentialists, this book is highly recommended and is a good text for those who want to teach the philosophy of man using an existential and phenomenological viewpoint."
4,Is this a book of essays about music? Art? Design?,"Is this a book of essays about music? Art? Design? I'd say it's a self-help book for those of us experimenting with traditional media in a digital world.In the universe of the digital revolution we find ourselves sometimes flying without a net. The author does a great job of providing some security. Each essay brings the reader close to the real process of composition - using examples of music, art and design from some of the pioneers of electronic media, coupled with his own real-world experiences.The essays are historical, educational, inspirational and just plain fun recollections and viewpoints. A good read for ""budding"" digital-revolution musicians, artists and designers, as well as seasoned veterans looking to expand their craft."
4,A chilling tale of Adolf Hitler,This book tells so much about Adolf Hitler. How he lived his life and what it was like. William L. Shirer writes this in a first person perspective. He actually witnessed these things happening and lives to tell about them.
1,Doesn't fit bottle,"We bought this product because we're supplementing breast feedings with bottle feedings at night. We'd thought this nipple would fit standard bottles. It doesn't. After one attempt, more milk leaked through the faulty seal between nipple and bottle than made it through the nipple. Yet nowhere does the product information state which bottle the nipple is designed to fit. Only specially designed Playtex bottles at [...] a set? No thanks."
2,TOO SLOW. SLOWER THAN SIMILAC/ ENFAMIL NIPPLES THEY USED IN THE NURSERY (HOSPITAL),"I bought the Playtex drop ins because it has a very good concept for a busy mom. We were travelling and thought this will be a good idea that I do not have to carry so many baby bottles and clean and sterilize them.The Slow Flow Silicone Nipple was way too slow, my 3 month old was frustrated and crying. She slept and didnt finish her formula which she normally does. She uses a no.1 nipple of Avent bottles which is comparable to slow flow so I thought I should get her a slow flow nipple of playtex as well. I tried sucking water from it and I myself can not get anything from the bottle.Now, I just purchased a Playtex Fast Flow latex nipple. I will review this nipple as soon as my baby tries on them."
2,too slow,"We had some Medela bottles and slow-flow nipples, and we were looking for extra ones that have similar flow rate and fit in the Playtex bottles that we already have. These fit well on the drop-in bottles, no leak so far. My son has no problem to switch from Medela nipples to these. However, the flow seems to be much slower than Medela slow-flow, so my son took longer time to drink the same amount of milk. At the end, he just felt so tired that he didn't finish the milk. I would recommend the medium flow from Playtex to use with the Medela slow-flow nipples."
3,Not very happy with the buy,We have purchased serveral of these nipples. These are usually a hit or a miss in terms of quality i.e. some times the nipples do not provide the right flow.
4,Breastfed Baby Likes It,My breastfed baby takes this nipple with no problems. He prefers the latex but he will take this one too.
3,Rather good!,The video was good in general but it was kind of difficult to control the volume. Sometimes you could hear well and sometimes you had to put the volume really loud to get to hear something. Every topic that they covered was well explained and it was noticeable that the presenters are knowledgeable about the topics but the problem is that the video did not follow a logical order of subjects. It was kinda disorganized. It was supposed to be a journey through the elements but it was rather a Wicca 101. Still I consider this a good VHS.
4,Excellent!,"For any teacher of the craft, both this video and its companion (""Discoverng Witchcraft: The Mysteries"") are indespensible teaching tools. They cover the basics of the craft in a very straight forward manner, and it's a great way to get started for new Witches as well as providing some answers for the curious mind."
5,A Wonderful Toy,"I think that Ello toys are great. It is well worth the money for your kids. They can build fairy cities, underwater towns or just regular neighborhoods. It is very educational because they can use their imaginations and make whatever they want. i am eveven years old and i love to play with Ello."
5,thrilled with ello,"I bought this set for my girls, who are 5,8, and 10. They love it. The fun is in creating characters and spaces for them, not in playing as much with what they create. The possibilities are endless, because the characters and spaces they create are abstract (when compared to lego, with which you can build a literal house). This toy, because of what it is, requires a spatial creativity, in my opinion. There are very few toys that engage spatial and visual creativity like this set does, and I am so happy to have found it. I could not recommend it enthusiastically, especially for a child that is visual-spatial or creative in an abstract three dimensional way."
2,"Plus for entry level users, minus for power users",This book is a decent compilation of information already available on the internet. It does save time in this respect. I was disappointed to find out that I already had the software on the CD or already knew the 'tips' the book had to offer.
4,I enjoyed this second volume MORE than the first!,"If I have a problem with this ""Awakening the Virgin"" series it's that it's not really about first-time lesbian encounters so much as women recalling a particular encounter they had later in life, or a particular woman. I guess I had hopes of more lesbian seduction.Having said that, I enjoyed this second volume of the series more than the first because I felt it included a certain kinkiness lacking in the first edition. These included episodes of sensual bondage and even some light spankings (nothing severe). I feel the first volume is bland in comparison."
1,Don't waste your time,"With the title, you'd think it'd be a book with some adventure. For the most part, it's really 200+ pages of tedium about working on a ship, being at sea and having to deal with bureaucrats. Find something better to read."
1,"Good Vendor, Poor Product","I am ok with vendor price and delivery. However I am very unhappy with actual products. The new charger was very cheap and flaky and the new battery did not charge on the purchased charger or on another known good charger. I did not bother to return either since I had already tossed the packaging assuming ""what could go wrong!"" Next time I will test the product before tossing the packaging!"
1,... gives real techno a bad name.,"When I bouth this CD I was under the impression that it was going to be techno. When did techno become more about lyrics than just really sweet beats and feelings? I find it hard to focus on the music when it is being drowned out by lyrics through the whole track. If you want to listen to good beats and rythems, this CD is not for you. On the other hand, if you're wating to listen to some woman's voice overtake the music, then this is the perfect CD for you."
3,it's an ok cd at best,"when blindedly purchasing this cd i thought,""hey, what the hell...it has aphrodite tracks so it must be a jump-up mix."" i was correct in thinking so. i gave this cd many chances, but i retired it to the pile of cd's i don't listen to anymore. true, this cd(s) does have a lot of pretty good tracks, but it suffers from the crappy tracks that are on it. i found my self putting in this cd, skipping to my 4 favorite tracks, and then taking it out and throwing it aside. then i'd put in the second cd and do the same. to make a long story short, if you already own the a1 sound carrier cd mixed by dj tonic, don't buy this cd cuz sound carrier is the only one you need....peace"
2,Art or Porn,"When asked the difference between art and pornagraphy, it is said one just knows. I ""just know"" that this books crosses the line way too often. I'll be enjoying a piece, eraptured by it's beauty, turn the page and be disgusted as nude characters fornicate on the next page.I have no problems with nudity in art. In fantasy art nude and nearly nude women (and some times men)are the excepted standard. When done with class and taste, like Amy Brown for example, it ehances the piece not distracts or in some cases disgusts. True art is something I can share with my children, discuss it with them, let it enrich their lives as it enriches mine; rather than hide in it the back of my closet so they don't see it."
5,Pin Extraction Tool,I have had electrical problems with my waverunner which was caused by dirty connections. This tool helped a lot when taking them apart so I could clean the connections.
3,"Owned 2: Attractive, functional.. for about a year.","Looks great, works very well for about six months-1 year. I have owned two and the both just up and died around that time. I am buying two more because my 4 year old refuses to use any other type. Not too bad considering they are cheap and work very well while they last. I never used the extra buttons, but I suppose they would have been nice if I ever remembered them. If you get one and like it, get a spare. They are cheap enough to be disposable in my opinion."
2,Works for a while,"It worked for a while (about 2 weeks) but after my kids droped it couple of times that was it. When shaking a noise was comming from the inside. After opening it, the resistor R1 was just bouncing around. It was unsoldered (not cold solder) so after the couple shakes it just came loose. Another thing was that the cable at the at the entrance in the mouse was also intermittent so I had to cut a piece of it out and reconnect it.Now it works OK. For how long?"
1,i-rocks Superman mouse,I used this mouse for approximately 4 hours at which time it stopped working. A notification popped up saying my USB device had lost its connection. Not only was the mouse no longer functioning but neither was my keyboard. I tried unplugging the mouse to see if my keyboard function would return but that did not help. I hard booted the computer with the mouse reconnected and my computer would not boot up and had a high pitched ringing. After keeping it off for about a half hour I rebooted and it came on. The mouse worked until the next day then locked up again with the same message popping up. After a couple more incidents like this I went back to my old mouse and have not had that problem again. I don't know if the mouse is defective or if it is just not compatible with my system but no other mouse has given me these problems.
2,"Cool mouse, but I don't have the software","I love the mouse, it takes a second to get use to the feel, but it is really neat. I did not get any software so I can not use all of its features on my Mac."
5,Simply Outstanding,"As in his ""Recognitions"", Gaddis has shown himself the true successor to Joyce. In wonderful verve he displays his understanding of America with the usual acute insight, humour and relish. He also examines the superficiality and materialism that comes with an established free-enterprise economy. Art has its saving graces but cannot save society (only perhaps the handful) in an imperfect world."
5,An American masterpiece,"JR is, and I think will come to be seen as, one of the greatest works of literature. Like the worlds other masterpieces, it rewards persistence magnificently. Like them, it takes some adjustment, for it is a sort of parallel world with a structure and complexity mirroring ours so well that one may mistake it, as one may take our world, for random chaos (the novel contains, in fact, a scene of pandemonium unequaled in literature). But the more one reads it, the more formal excellence it discloses: both in its overall plan and in its detail. JR is a book of voices, written mostly in dialogue. Among other things, it is the greatest novel of New York and environs ever written. Head and shoulders above any other American novel of this century. Buy it, and just keep reading"
4,Highly Entertaining,Given the small number of reviews for this book I thought I'd throw in my two cents. This really is an interesting read and once you figure out who the main characters are it becomes an easy read too. After about 200-300 pages it really starts to click and then things just roll along. It is funny and cynical and just plain entertaining. It has a unique structure where the reader is bounced from one character or group to another. There will be a conversation and then one of the members leaves or runs into someone and then you follow him/her off to another conversation/episode. It is very creative and well done. It's actually a fairly fast read despite 726 pages with no chapter or section breaks.
2,Dated Good,"OK two stars -- only because it is dated ...The terms used for the groups were state-of-art when book was written, but have been changed ... the Standards Group has renamed (dispensed with) the EU designations. That said, it is an ideal beginners guide. It will give a want-a-be-new-be a feel for the subject matter and a place to start. However, the field is moving quickly and things are changing ...with an abundance of data on the Ashkenazi and Icelandic ... which relates them back to Central Asia and the founders of the Aryan founders of the Indus Valley Civilizations. For the rest (Far Eastern/African/Native American) -- much is still missing. But you need not concern yourself with that -- this book will give you what you need to go there too."
3,"Odd Title, Odd Twist","Conversely frenzied with overwrought direction and rendered flatfooted with early sixties naivete, this oddly paced, offbeat psychodrama is nonetheless worth a waltz because of Sal Mineo's jazzy foray as a disco waiter swirling down the drain of sexual schizophrenia. Passing in and out of his orbit are Juliet Prowse as a repressed wannabe actress, Jan Murray as a widower of a sex-crime victim, and Elaine Stritch as a closet lesbian. Unfortunately, Prowse gets more chance to prance than Mineo (or does it just seem that way?) Anyway, it's worth sitting through this feature just see Sal do the jerk!"
5,I'M STILL WAITING!!!!!,When will this be released on DVD format? Hello?!This is one of the three must have movies I'm still looking for...
4,A CD that's worth it for 12 songs rather than 49 songs,"Although I do not have this CD, this is worth it for those looking for a few of his early recordings rather than the slightly more expensive 2 CD UA Collection which you are better off getting as the 2 CD set is more complete while this does contain 12 of his UA best including ""Last Time I Saw Her,"" ""Wherefore and Why,"" ""I'm Not Sayin',"" ""Ribbon of Darkness,"" etc. If you buy the 2 CD set you'll get even more of his great UA work including the protest song, ""Black Day In July."" For the budget minded, this is a great collection [for the price, but as] I said earlier, you can get all 4 UA albums in their entirety on the ""United Artists Collection"" which is the better bargain. Either way, you can get lots of great music and it's the music that counts after all."
2,Pretty but cheaply made,"I receive this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend.This is my birth stone so I love amethyst,unfortunately I had to return due to a stone falling out after wearing it only 2 weeks.The stones are a lite shade of purple,not dark Africa amethyst & cross is pretty but cheaply made.I returned this item and choose not to have it replaced.I gave it only 2 stars cause it is pretty but not made well.Buying beware."
3,Meet the minimal expectations but ...,"I am an newcomer for patterns, not sure patterns should be transparent to implementation languages. But this book definitely focus on C++. As a Java people, I don't find some of the patterns useful, for example, active object. Java has directly implemented it. Anyway, this book is in good design and pretty readable."
5,"Great intro to pre-""fly like/dreams"" Steve Miller","Yeah I know, you couldn't swing a dead cat in the 70's without hitting a radio playing Fly Like an Eagle and Book of Dreams ad nausem. But for those of us who appreciate Steve as a pretty darn creative musician this earlier stuff really shines. Living in the USA and Space Cowboy are just great rock anthems. Steve mellows out with Your Saving Grace and brings out the BAD in bad-girl Mary Lou. Great for old fans or new friends!"
4,How to make a Commando,"This book details the training of SEALS, Special Forces, and Delta. An eye opener! The SEALS are the most physically fit warriors on earth. The Green Berets are perhaps the most intelligent soldiers in the entire military. And Delta Force is something straight out of a James Bond movie--those guys can do everything! Read it and find out how to make a commando! To read about these men in action, a better book would be ""Black Hawk Down"" by Mark Bowden."
3,There are better books out there,"I read this book in July of 2002, so the information is 7 years old. Which is really the problem with this book. While the information was probably very current in 1995, it was very outdated for 2002. The information was interesting, and there was a lot of information I didn't know.My last knock against the book is that the author is a journalist, and it is very obvious in the book; as specific parts are sensationalized when they didn't need to be. Overall a decent book, but If you're looking for a book on Spec Ops, there are much much better books out there."
5,A true work of art.,The Commandos is a tremendous source for information on whatsome men endure to become the best of the best. Hell Week hasnever been better. The attention to detail this book offerswould do any member of special-ops proud.
4,Good insight,Waller gives good information in the book which covers too wide of a topic for specifics. I wish he would have included the Marine Force Recon and PJ's or CCT's to make it more complete. But he did a good job on those that he did. He makes valid points about their training and correlating it back to their combat roles.
4,"An awsome book, Very well written!","I gave this book four stars because it did not include other intresting units such as US Airborne Rangers, PJ's, and CCT's. The chapter on Robin Sage was intresting because not alot is written about SF training. I am a ""pro"" Army person, but I have to give it to the SEAL's, they are a tough and tight knit group that is ready to Jump, Dive, March into action at any time. The chapter on their training was very good. The part I was most intrested in was the chapter on the SF missions during Desert Sheild/Storm. It was very intresting to see how they prepare for clandestine operations. Even though it did not highlight my favorite SOF (Rangers), it was a VERY well written book. HARD TO PUT DOWN, A MUST BUY!"
3,Cute but...,This is cute but it is activated by shaking the rattle that comes with it. You have to shake it very hard to get it to move. Sometimes I could not even get it to move myself let alone a baby being able to do this. The concept is cute and the music is nice but I was disappointed by the effort required to get this to move. Its now in the toy box and has not been bothered with for quite sometime.
4,Fun with Pooh and Turtle,I now have purchased three of these toys for my two grandchildren and a child of a friend. Each of the children have found this toy to be fun especially where they can use the rattle to make Pooh and Turtle go. The voice is so clear and the toy is fun to watch for long periods of time. Children really love this toy and can be found carrying it from room to room.
4,Pooh can do no wrong!,"I bought this for my nephew for his first Christmas. He's 9 months now and it's his favorite toy! He likes to shake the rattle and make Pooh and Turtle go. He's still pushing for his first crawl and he really wants to follow Pooh and Turtle! He loves to grab it and hug it, or maybe try to eat it. Pooh's voice and music are adorable and makes my nephew laugh, every time. The only down side is, when I talk to my sister & brother in law, the first thing they do is sing Pooh's riding song. And then I have it in my head the rest of the day!"
2,Needs volume control!,"We are generally disappointed in this toy. The first one we received was defective and didn't work at all. We returned it to the store but were informed it was discontinued, so we had to order a replacement online. When it arrived, it also did not work as advertised, but it does work. However, it is VERY loud! The speaker is located inside Pooh's head, and we can't get inside the toy to muffle it with tape or anything else. I imagine it would be loud enough to damage a child's hearing if the child's ear is close to it. That being said, my 4-year-old likes it, but my 9-month-old (whom it was actually for) ignores it."
5,"Great, better than I expected...will by the other Pooh",I bought this for my grandson. He is six months old and knows how to use the rattle to make Pooh walk on his turtle. Great toy.
1,Wrong item,"I had to return this item -- I'd ordered a CD, but received a 7-inch record instead. The good news is that my return went quite smoothly, and I was credited the cost of the item to my account."
4,Excellent and Indispensible reference,"I have the original 1970 edition of this work and was looking for a copy for a friend. It's worth giving to those who appreciate real Chinese food. It's a very stark book - not much text at all, and the recipes are of the ""Add A to B to C"" type, but if you are competant in the kitchen, then you only need the ingredient list, anyway. It's truly an encyclopedia - its collection of dishes are complete, and the regional information is given for each. This book makes it criminally easy to plan a Cantonese dinner party or a Mandarin luncheon and to be assured of doing it right. All in all, my copy is perhaps the most well worn kitchen reference I own."
5,Great vitamins!,"I have taken these vitamins everyday for the last 8 years. I started taking them in my early 40's because I was feeling tired and low on energy. I ask my doctor and she said try vitamin's. so I did. If I miss a day, I feel it!!!! Twinlab ""B"" Stress Complex and Twinlab Multivitamin do wonders for me! I take them every morning and evening with a meal. I have had 1 cold in the last 8 years before that I got colds every season!Doctors say vitamins dont help keep colds away. All I can say is I feel much much better taking them, than not!I recommend them to everyone, friends and family alike!"
5,Vitamins that I used to buy at Health Food Store,"I am so glad I found these at Amazon. I used to go to my health food store for these, that was the only place I could find them. They are much more reasonable at Amazon, I save lots of money! Plus, they are delivered right to my door."
1,Made me sick,"I took these pills with eating a meal first and everytime I had a headache after taking the pill. I threw up twice when taking them. Needless to say, I stopped taking them."
1,Possibly Toxic Megadoses,"Nowhere could I find a list of ingredients before buying online. Turns out it's got megadoses of vitamins and minerals, with some doses actually being possibly toxic!!!!!Upset my stomach and upset me even more. This is not right - somewhere it should say that some doses are 500% to 1,800% of DV. Four are over 1,000%!!!"
5,Twin Lab,Doctor recommended these caps. Have been taking them for about a year. Used to get colds all the time. Have had one cold since taking these vitamins. Feel much better and vitamin B levels are great.
3,Daily vitamin,"Although I have taken this in the past and enjoyed the product, this time around (following the directions) it made me sick everytime I took it. Maybe my stomach is now to sensitive for the product."
5,Great product recommended by my Doctor!,"This was a re-order, I get this regularly - don't miss a pill. Makes me feel better! My Doctor recommended them. Will continue to use them, great service."
4,You don't always notice until the bottle runs empty,"I've always found it difficult to decipher the pro's and con's of daily vitamin consumption. The only thing I can offer is over the last month or so I've noticed a slight reduction in energy and focus. Overall I still feel decently healthy, however, it recently dawned on me that about 3 weeks ago I stopped taking these daily vitamins b/c my supply ran dry. Now it wouldn't be right to contribute this reduction in energy solely on the demise of my vitamin consumption but it would be safe to say it's very possible these vitamins may have been benefiting me all along. I'm placing another order regardless :)"
2,"Seem like good vitamins, but I had a bad reaction.......","After reading the reviews on Amazon, I tried these Twinlab Daily One Caps Multi-Vitamin. It seemed like a reliable company and a good idea to take a capsule to help with absorption.I read some of the reviews from people who had bad reactions but I never had any problems before with any vitamin, but I had exactly the same negative experience as others! The first time it happened, I thought maybe I needed to take this vitamin on a full stomach after breakfast. I switched to taking them with food and lots of water. It helped. The other day, I took one before breakfast and the exact, same experience happened again- intense sweating and throwing up. I have given up on them and switched to an old reliable,Centrum for Seniors. I also noticed intense yellow urine color after taking this vitamin in the morning. I felt like some of the ingredients were not being absorbed.Very disappointed."
1,made me sick to my stomach,"I was using Rainbow light multi vitamin for years, but due to health reasons, I need to avoid plant ingredients. So I switched to Daily One Caps. I took the capsule with my breakfast and 15 min later I was so nauseous. I tried it for a week, hoping my body would adjust...but it made me sick to my stomach. I switched to Nature Made Multi -- no problems."
1,Not For Those With Crohn's Disease!,"Got these for my wife, who has crohn's disease. She needs a multivitamin and these ""seemed"" perfect.After taking them for a week her crohn's symptoms flared up and she had to stop taking them. We waited until she was back to normal, then tried again, just in case it was something else the previous time. Nope. She had problems once again.Then I decided that I would take them, to use them up. A multi-vitamin is good for everyone, right? Ha. First time I took them, I took it with a glass of water. I was sick to my stomach for 30min afterwards. The time after I made sure to take one with a big breakfast. I was still sick to my stomach and almost lost my breakfast.So I threw these out and will never recommend or use them again."
1,Made me vomit,"I'm not sure why, but these multivitamins made me extremely nauseated every time I took them, to the point where I actually vomited. I have no allergies that I know of."
5,Good Overall,"I bought this product because it was highly recommended by a friend; apparently, Twinlab sources better materials than your average 1-a-day. I also liked that the container is glass rather than plastic. I reuse glass containers so it was an added bonus.Very good deal with the subscribe and save option."
1,Great until it broke,"We purchased this vacuum cleaner in November 2006. We previuosly had a Kenmore canister that broke after 5 years. We loved the way the Bosch worked, the quietness and the ease of vacuuming. Our house has mostly hardwood floors & tile and the only carpeting is on our stairs and bedrooms. The vacuum is only used once a week. It lasted 6 months. That's when the fun began. Their customer service is lousy. There is only one service center in California. I live in San Diego and the service center is 600 miles away in SF. In addition, Bosch requires you to mail the vacuum cleaner at your own expense even though it is under warranty. This will be the last product I buy from this manufacturer. I expected more from them especially in this price range."
4,The replacement parts are difficult to fine,"I brought mine at Costco. I did not even know it didn't come with any extra filter and bags. When I finished my first bag that came with the vacuum, I had a hard time to find the replacement. The only option is go on line. Costco sells the vacuum but not the parts--go figure! My experience with the vacuum it self has been pretty good. I was reading some of the reviews that theirs was broken shortly after they purchased it. Thank god mine is still doing good. I can understand how they would get angry it because it is not a cheap invetsment. It was the most I had paid for a vacuum. I just wish it's eaiser to get the hold of the replacements parts. I would not call this a piece ""garbage"" really it's not that bad. I"
1,Flimsy piece of junk,"The first day we got this vacuum, my son broke one of the plastic pieces trying to change the attachments. Shame on us, we shouldn't have let him mess with it, but still we were amazed at how easily it broke. Fortunately, Costco was happy to exchange it for a new one. A few months later, I was adjusting the telescoping wand, when the same plastic piece broke! How could a vacuum so expensive have such flimsy plastic parts? Also, as other reviewers have noted, the attachment door opens all the time, the cord is too short, and it's really inconvenient not having the on/off on the handle. The suction is decent, but who cares if the thing falls apart?"
1,Short and Flimsy,"I have used the Bosch Vacuum for over a year and would not buy it again. I am not sure what I would buy because I have tried several brands and they all suffer from flimsy construction.The good things are it does a good job cleaning both carpet and hard wood floors. It has good suction and does appear to trap the dirt in the filter system.But, here are the shortfalls:Both the hose and cord a very short. It is best suited to a small apartment or condo.The tools are tiny. They look like they come from a child's toy vacuum set and work just about as well.The biggest problem is the flimsy construction. The vacuum head has come off and the conduit covering the cord whichsupplies power to the vacuum head has come off. It uses two sided tape to stick which is ridiculous.I am afraid I will be forced to replace the Bosch soon. With its high price, it is just a poor value."
1,poor craftmanship,"I loved this vacuum until it started to fall apart. It began with the very short cord getting stuck and then frayed. That was wrapped with electrical tape. Then the hose tore at the point of entry to the canister. Again we used electrical tape to hold it together. Finally, the hose tore at the other end and out comes the electrical tape again. Instead of a 2 year vacuum, it looks like a 10 year vacuum. It also flips over easily and the attachments fall out and we lost one. Soo, I guess the moral of the story is don't get a Bosch vacuum!! Also, it was overpriced for the quality and forget about the service!"
2,Nice but...,"It is light weight, has good suction but as a canister it is lacking. The hose is too short, the handle is awkward to use and there is no extension pipe to use with the handle to reach things over shoulder high. We use an upright for the floors and a canister to dusting and hard to get at places. This product does not work for us which is a shame since it was so expensive."
3,"Good Style, Great Resources...BUT...","As an avid travel reader and as the spouse of a Hungarian I was pleased to pick up this book. Ms. Brue has a wonderful writing style, both informative and with a wry wit that shines thru beautifully. Cathedrals of the Flesh is a great read. At the end, the author lists major baths from around the world and indeed this is what inspired me to pick it up *several baths in Budapest are listed*. I am assuming that the author did in fact visit the baths listed, but there is nothing in the book on public baths in Hungary. Considering the rather large chapter devoted to Russia, this is disappointing to say the least. Having said that and admitting that this is a personal criticism on my part, the book istelf is very good. I look forward to reading more from this author."
5,A Bather's Baedeker,"This is a thoroughly delightful, often amusing, account of Alexia's search for the perfect bath. Once started, the book is difficult to put down; by the end, you not only know a bit more about her 'on hold' relationship with Charles, and want to know even more about her fascinating putative business partner Marina, but you have painlessly absorbed as much information as you could want to know about the differing characteristics of a variety of national public baths. Along the way, you will also have met a number of characters who are not easy to forget, and you will have a guide to which baths to use and which to avoid-of not inconsiderable benefit to one visiting Turkey who, like Alexia, is warned to avoid the 'unhygienic' baths in Istanbul. The evocative line drawings by Lynda Reeves McIntyre which appear at the head of each chapter fittingly complement the book."
5,Wonderful witty writing by an author who shows great promise,"This book about a young woman's travels around the world to find the perfect spa is just the right thing to curl up with on a snowy weekend afternoon. The author serves up a delicious mix of eccentric characters, quirky encounters and fascinating history. The pages turn and you learn a lot without even knowing it! That's the perfect kind of nonfiction book, in my opinion. It's also inspired me to go visit a bath at the first possible opportunity."
5,A must have for Judy fans,yes of course you can hear the flaws in this CD but that does not take away for Judy these have been some of my favorite songs since i first had the Cassette tape in 1990.I just bought the CD again and will always love Judy.
2,Very poor quality!,"When I first played this CD, I was very disappointed at the sound quality, which sounded very hissy, and destroyed the sheer beauty of Judy Garland's voice. About the only good song I did like on it was the last one, ""You'll Never Walk Alone."" But all you other Judy Garland fans, beware of this CD!"
3,Not The Way I'd End The First Half,"What's sneaky about this volume is that while no real new information is revealed, just enough foreshadowing is done that viewers need to watch this volume to keep up. While the episodes on this volume aren't fantastic, they will keep fans of the series entertained at least. Fans of Oreldo and Martis will be happy with episodes that revolve mostly around them and the two part story at the end manages to be just mysterious enough that I still want to know more about what is being covered up."
1,worst customer service ever,Jvc has the worst customer service ever. Do not buy their products. I sent a car radio in for service & it came back it in the worst shape. I didn't send it in scratched up. They broke the usb port & basicaly said to bad. Do not but jvc.
2,Disappointing,"I wasn't expecting much given the price, but what came in the mail was clearly a USED product. The hinge is completely scratched, the box was full of dust and dirt, and there are scratches on the lamp base as well. Also - be careful when moving the base. Since the lamp arms don't swivel, you have to move the base to turn the lamp. Unfortunately something on the base ended up making big scratch marks on my desk, so make sure to put something under it. I bought this to replace a broken IKEA one, and I have to say - it's the same price but far inferior in quality."
1,"Ordered new, but used one came.","I ordered new product and I paid full amount. But when I got it, there are some name written on it in a permanent marker. Sally something and dates. Extremely dissapointed. Also, the light is very dim. Not suitable for reading. You'll need other light to read under this lamp."
2,Its not really painting,"I bought this for a 4 year old girl. She seems mildly interested in it despite the fact that the ""paint"" is some kind of very hard substance and doesn't come off on the sponges so making the fun pictures is difficult unless you're very persistent and have the PERFECT amount of water in your sponge. Also, many of the sponges are too big for the circles of paint provided so its hard to use those particular ones for your picture. It does come with a cute apron which she loves to wear but I wouldn't recommend this as a sponge painting toy. You just end up making a big watery mess on a piece of paper but don't get the satisfaction of actually painting."
5,Best Tafsir of the Qur'an,"Allamah Tabatabai has written the finest exgesis of the Qur'an yet. Every sentence, every word, every preposition is heavily scrutinized and examined from grammer, from hadith, from philisophical viewpoint, and from relevant verses from the Qur'an. A very through and exhaustive work. No other tafsir comes close."
4,Great program but....,it is $30 cheaper on the barry's bootcamp website. Save your money and get it start from the barry's bootcamp site. I bought mine for 14.95 plus shipping and handling for this set.
1,Special Equiptment Needed,"I guess I should have read into this one a little further before buying. Apparently, you need to have a Barry's Bootcamp ball and some resistance bands. I have a regular stability ball but Barry's is almost like a 'canister' or 'tube' shape so a normal ball won't work. (In one of the first work out scenes they lay on ball on their backs with the resistance tube underneath for chest presses)It looked to be a pretty good workout but I honestly didn't get too far into it for lack of proper equiptment. :(I looked on amazon to see how much one of his balls were and was disappointed to see that they were $40-$50. I guess I'll know better next time to read more closely to see if there is any 'special' equiptment needed before I buy."
4,A good mix of humor and suspense,"Mix a little humor with murder and suspense and you have a good read. This is the first, of I hope will be more novels by this new author. The millionaire/billionaire father of a young girl is murdered while they are at the shoreside amusement park. The girl being ""witness"" to the murder of her father. The story is told in first person by one of the two protagonists--one a older, idealistic-non nonsense cop, his partner a summer cop who does not even have a gun. Easy enjoyable read with short chapters makes it a perfect companion for the plane or the beach. The sequel should come out in early summer."
1,Annoying,"A painful narrator, a cardboard hero and a ridiculous set-up are the reasons to jump to the end. The ending is no surprise. But the characters are absurd. Don't waste your time."
5,Fun mystery. I love the whole series!,"I love the location in this book, as it's different and full of possibilities. The characters are fun, and the mystery keeps things moving. This is one series I plan to re-read soon."
5,Fun Surprise!,"Wow! This one surprised me. I'm not a big mystery fan, but this bright pink book looked like fun, and it was! A great story, and it kept me laughing too. My only complaint is that it went by so fast. I hope this guy writes another one soon."
4,It's charm is immediate.,"Idlewild's pop-driven rock shines with a crystal clear quality while still retaining that rough edge. This album takes no getting used to at all, it's charm is very immediate. This Scottish band churns out rock with a raw pop injection. Vocalist Roddy Woomble sounds like a young Michael Stipe but the R.E.M. comparisons don't end there. His bandmates harmonise with him on some of the choruses (such as ""Mistake Pagent"", one of my favourites incidently) in a way Mike Mills did with Stipe all those years ago. ""I Don't Have The Map"" and ""Roseability"" are very catchy although I still do not know who Gertrude Stein is, and just why she warrants a pop song. There's a youthful enthusiasm and energy going on here that's hard to deny."
4,WONDERFUL BUT NOT PERFECT,"I first heard 'Little Discourage' and 'Those Wooden Ideas' 2 years ago on my friends portable minidisc player and i knew i had to have them after half a listen. I recorded the tracks and knew i had to get the album. I got round to picking it up last week (sept-01), and finally i had decent recordings of those two amazing tracks but there was more. Tracks 2 and 6 are also up there with the best and tracks 5/7/8 and 11 were also very good. I love this bands energy and vocals (not just the sound of singer but the way they surround the beautiful melodies). I found the other tracks a little boring but to be fair i haven't paid them much attention due to the quality of the rest of the album). This album is well worth getting and i recommend it to fans of ASH, OCS and MANIC STREET PREACHERS."
4,"while you're comparing, i'm just listening","REM blah Nirvana blah Fugazi blah etc etc (but Radiohead? whatever).These guys are just making their music, and it's refreshingly different and noisy and melodic. They have the sonic variety of songs like ""Listen to what you've got"" and ""The bronze medal"" included on the same album, with the rest of the great songs here falling somewhere in-between. Much more refined than their previous work ""Hope is important"" (if you want a more punk sound, then try that one instead.) A fine CD that you can both rock out to, as well as get misty over. Listen for yourself and decide, but it sure works for me."
3,Maybe it's just me,"I wanted to like this so much more than I do. There's real talent here; as noisy guitar bands with a pop edge go, Idlewild does it as well as anybody in 2001. But, unfortunately, they're doing it several years too late. This sort of thing has been done to death already, and I just can't find anything they're adding that makes Idlewild SOMETHING SPECIAL...you know, the kind of band you fall in love with.This is a CD (and band) that when you're in exactly the right mood, if you happen to put it on, it might sound like a great album. But when you're out of that mood, you'd be very unlikely to put this on over ""Nevermind,"" ""New Day Rising,"" ""Loveless,"" ""Daydream Nation,"" or whatever.But then again, maybe it's just me."
4,best single of the last 5 years,"I don't mean to discredit the rest of the album but the song Idea Track has got to be one of the best feel-good-radio-pop songs of all time. You know, lik the Pixies' Here Comes Your Man and Head On by Jesus & Mary Chain??? Yeah. You'll bop your head to it in the car, you'll play it for all friends, everybody will think you're cool and they'll all want you to copy the cd for them."
5,Technically GOOD but nothing!,"I bought this album over year ago and this is definitely a very good album. The vocals may not be to everyone's taste and they may not be the best musicians that you've ever heard, but to me, that is the quirk of Idlewild. If you're into refined music, then this is not for you. If you want you're music mad, then this is it! DO BUY THIS AS IT IS POSSIBLY THE BEST OF ITS GENRE THIS YEAR!"
3,hmmm....,"these guys really sound like REM on some of these songs. with a little bit of early Blur thrown in and some harder sounding guitar work. i had heard great things about this band and i got this album expecting to be blown away. but even though there are a few good songs on here, nothing really astounds me and i find myself being bored and even a little bit annoyed while listening to this. it just sounds kind of underdone. not bad, but... perhaps some of their later records are a bit better?"
2,Don't bother,"I know I'll get slammed for writing this. Oh well, c'est la vie. Don't waste your time, yet another example of a Radiohead, Travis wanna-be. I read the review previously posted and bought it, I will be much more cautious when reading reviews. Like I said, look elsewhere for nouveau brit-pop. Check out Doves or Elbow."
3,REM... the sequel,"Although I'm not the hugest REM fan, I certainly know a good imitation, and Idlewild is it. The entire CD from start to finish sounds more like an REM album than maybe even one of their own. While I am personally not attracted to this album, or style, others may want to check it out for themselves and decide."
2,Michael Stipe's illegitimate child....,"Yeah, you know what, I don't know why I got this. I listened to the sound clips and said ""Not bad..."" So, when I noticed this in a big, fancy electronic store, I bought it. And you know what? I feel like I'm listening to R.E.M. I don't even like R.E.M. Michael Stipe sounds like a goat, and so does this guy. I do like the actual music though. That's why it got two stars. I don't know. If you like R.E.M., then get this. You'll like it. But it almost sounds like he's TRYING to sound like Michael Stipe. For some reason, this makes me want to wash a car on an autumn day. This is car washin' music. So, if you like R.E.M., goats, David Hasselhoff (?), or washing cars, buy it. If you like to laugh at David Hasselhoff, go watch Knight Rider. Heh heh. Ehh..."
3,There Are Better Collections Around,"This collection, which came out in 1990, is typical of early CD releases: 12 selections and either minimal liner notes or none at all. In this instance, however, there is a single page of text on the reverse of the cover photo providing some interesting background.A much better bet is ""The Best Of The Capitol Masters"" as it contains all the same selections save one, plus eight more. Here, however, you do get the wonderful and hard-to-find Mary Ford interpretation of Smoke Rings which made it to # 14 in the summer of 1952 b/w In The Good Old Summertime [# 15].And the price is certainly right."
5,great memory,les paul and mary ford were a perfect team. they made beautiful music together and les made the first electric guitar. some of their songs were before my time but i enjoyed them anyway. anyone who enjoys beautiful music will enjoy this cd. marsha
5,Fantastic Les!,"Having seen a fine documentary on Les Paul, we determined to lock away their hit songs. He was such an amazing innovator and total musician, most of which was unknown at the time of his hits. He actually created the electric guitar and the wonderful tones and shades all subsequent electronic music continues to explore. This record does not disappoint, but recalls the great Les Paul/Mary Ford years. How high the moon? Pretty high! Sought, found, ordered, delivered. What more could one ask from a fine supplier? Rehtorical question. Nothing."
4,Locate the Castle of your dreams....,"Well the version I have is a 1987 version of this book. It is actually quite nice and handy. This book shows many pictures of the castles as well as where each one is located on maps for each separate area of England (north, south, east, west and even Scotland).Granted, the pictures of some of the Castles appear to be from either the 1960's, 1970's or at their earliest 1980's. However, I am sure little has changed. The synopsis of each castle mentioned within this books pages is historically informative but does not go into too much detail.I highly recommend this book especially if you are traveling to England/Scotland and don't want to waste time looking for castles that are over hyped or left in ruins that would not spark your interest or imagination. This book can help you quickly assess and pick the castles that may be more along the lines of a person's particular taste, desire or dream."
4,WISH EVERYONE IN AMERICA WOULD WATCH THIS,"If all Americans would watch this, I think our country would finally get off their butts and get our government to do something about this serious problem."
1,Fair and unbiased? hardley,"This DVD is terrbily narrowminded and fails to give an accurate reresentation of many of the truths behind illegal immigration. They take the popular point of view, that view being that illegals are ruining the country and they are all criminals etc. Folks, there is a lot more to it than that and there is another story that is not shown here. If you want to see a good documentary on illegals watch ""Crossing Arizona"" (not the Farley Bros. movie)."
5,Illegal immigration!!!,"Outstanding clarification of the problem--how it came to be--and why we must solve it! It defines the sabotage involved, and illustrates the detrimental impact on infrastructure and the fabric of American life in general. The lives lost (and taken) in this ""informal war"" (reminds me of the Korean War) are just so unnecessary, and should never have happened! The foment is artificial, and of a very disruptive nature (as in deliberate). The definition of an outlaw is one who violates one law after another, with no concern for the cumulative effect. This DVD illustrates the current, salient, and active endorsement by some factions of pure lawlessness. This is also part of the definition of anarchy, the complement of chaos!"
1,It's not worth the asking price!,"Okay, one star isn't fair-- it's about 2.5 or 3 stars really, but I really want to discourage anyone from buying it thinking that it's like some incredible ""long lost treasure from Ryan Adam's past.""Let me preface this with the standard ""I'm a HUGE Ryan Adams fan!""I bought it back when it was about 10 bucks a pop, didn't like it then and ended up selling it back to the CD store. Then I saw that it was out of print and saw the prices climbing so I bought it again for about 24 bucks. Then I went home and listened to it again and remembered why I had sold it in the first place.Some of the songs can be found on Faithless Street. The only song worth mentioning that you might not be able to get anywhere else is ""Pawnshop Ain't No Place for a Wedding Ring"" which is the only song that could fall under that ""lost treasure"" category. But $35 for one song? Jar Jar says: Meesa Nosa Thinka So!"""
3,Robb goes to Scotland,"Candace Roobb, author of the successful Owen Archer series, ventures into Scotland at the time of Willaim Wallace. With a female central character and descriptions of early Scottish towns the stage is set to explore a time of civil unrest. A little disappointing in execution, maybe she will improve as the character develops."
3,I would read the sequel,"I have not read much of Candance Robb. I think having read some of her writing before did much to prepare me for what to expect in A Trust Betrayed.No, the novel is not a ""serious"" piece of historical fiction. A Trust Betrayed does not echo the rich, complex and painfully crafted historicity found in... say, Emberto Eco's books. Robb's book is, instead, popular fiction for the long flight. (Popular fiction allows one to choose to switch on or switch off during reading). She has a plot which seems simple at first- Margaret Kerr searches for her husband in Edinburgh, then the plot grows more and more complex, including the civil unrest and fight for Scottish freedom.It reads smoothly. Sure, I switched off while reading, merely enjoying the story, never contesting the historical information in the book. I finished it in a few hours. I was a pleasant read- a fine way to spend a hot Sunday afternoon. I would read the sequel."
4,An Excellent Read and Looking Forward to More,"I have read a few of the Owen Archer series and find them tedious with rather fantastic story lines. I was pleasantly surprised with the story of Dame Kerr. I found her extremely interesting and extremely believable. The story was also interesting, without going in to the dramatic. Too many times in a historical mystery I find myself asking if the female character would really do such and such. Not so with Dame Kerr, whose actions and concerns are believable, given the time and place.Robb's historical research has also improved. She deserves kudos for not romanticizing the world and actions of William Wallace. I look forward to reading more."
3,13th Century Scotland,"A Trust Betrayedby Candace RobbFoul smells, chilly dampness, and a fearful, untrusting, poverty-stricken populous characterize the setting of Candace Robb's first story about twenty year old Margaret Kerr. Margaret has come to the still small city of Edinburgh determined to find her missing husband, and to uncover the murderer of his young cousin. Intrigues abound with the occupation of the lowlands by King Edward Longshanks's English troops, and with claimants John Balliol and Robert Bruce vying for the title of King of the Scots. The Historical Notes might have been fuller, offering a much needed crutch for those not seeped in Scotland's Wars of Independence. And the story's inconclusive ending is a rather too blatant signal that more Margaret Kerr stories will follow. That said, the story gives us a maturing, complicated female character who is feeling her way in a time when Scots are forced to choice sides."
2,Read Ellis Peters Instead,"Any of the Ellis Peters Cadfael books delivers better writing, a more interesting storyline, more likeable characters and some kind of resolution. A Trust Betrayed has many elements of a good mystery, but some seem to have been thrown in to provide some kind of explanation for something else. Perhaps something is resolved in book two, but I won't be reading it. The one Owen Archer book I read was better than this, but not by much. Was looking for a good series to read, unfortunately this was not it."
3,Would you please repeat that.,"I found this book a difficult read. ""Flatland"" by A. Square (an illustrator) is a definite pre-requisite, and helpful, but even with that under my belt I had problems following Mr. Rucker."
2,Wait for the next edition!,"This is a book which does not, as yet, live up to its considerable promise.Much of the Author's information dealing with Winnt 4.0 seems to be based upon some version which certainly isn't the one that I have!Example: she talks about the NT Device Manager fairly frequently. Huh? No such beast in my machine!The number of times the illustrative figures do not show what they are supposed to is shocking and annoying. ( probably McGraw's fault, but that doesn't help the reader.)On the back of the book, there's a little reddish starburst which contains the extremely over-optimistic blurb: ""Diagnose and fix problems fast with the companion CD-Rom!"" Truly a ludicrous statement that the publisher should be ashamed of.On a positive closing note, the book does have some useful information, but only ""some"".If you buy it, be prepared to read carefully and warily."
3,"For the first time, Germano loses her focus","Lisa Germano is, simply, one of the most amazing artists to emerge in the 1990's. For me, 'Geek the Girl' had the same emotional impact as the first Velvet Underground LP, Nick Drake's 'Pink Moon', Nico's 'Desertshore' and the best Cat Power songs. Tough standard. Like all those artists, her art and message is a sad one. 'Slide' is her first CD to leave me wanting more. Producer Tchad Blake spent a lot of care here, but sometimes the results seem a little fussy. Most Germano songs are slow-tempo, but ""Way Below the Radio"", ""Turning Into Betty"" and ""Electrified"" drag noticeably. This CD isn't a ""concept"" record like her last 2, so perhaps I miss that momentum. But ""Slide"" feels disjointed, uneasy , and for the first time, frustrated. I'm smiling as I type this, wondering if Germano's previous work hasn't left me spoiled with unreasonable expectation. Do you need this? Yes. Sadly, this may be her final record. If so, it will not be the best way to go out."
4,Very addictive,"What a soothing album. I heard ""Wood Floors"" from a friend and couldn't stop listening to the song. When I wasn't listening to it, I found myself humming it. The song reminded me of twirling around in my socks on the hardwood floors of my parents' house when I was a kid. It made me want to be 8 again and skating around the house in my socks.The rest of the album is really nice. I've been listening to it at work practically all day today. I just put it on repeat and let it go. Some of the songs make me want to slow dance with my honey. There isn't anything extra original on this album, but it's a good album that makes you feel like there is something extra original about it.I'm currently borrowing this album from my boyfriend, but will be adding it to my collection soon."
5,one of my favorites,"Slide is my favorite Lisa Germano album and is also one of my all-time favorite albums. The songs are weird but accessible and timeless. The production is somewhat abstract and spacey while maintaining a sense of intimacy, and nowhere does it sound like anything is out of place. She doesn't have a huge vocal range in terms of notes or dynamics, but her voice is warm, earthy, and perfect for her songs. Beyond that, it is hard to describe the style of her music.Aside from being her most accessible album from a general listening standpoint, Slide also contains my favorite song of hers, ""Wood Floors."" It is just beautiful and simple, magical. Other favorite tracks on Slide include ""Way Below the Radio,"" ""Tomorrowing,"" ""Crash,"" and ""Reptile.""I never get tired of listening to this, and I've had it for a couple years. If you like melancholy, beautiful, odd music that also has a sardonic streak, give this a listen."
3,Important Theory,"I really enjoyed the idea of the theory of multiple intelligences. However, I found the book lengthy, and possibly would have liked to read a more abridged version. I realize that Gardner must have sufficient support for his theory, but it did get a little long at times. Despite this, the book was a well-detailed analysis of the wider range of human intelligences and I believe that this theory will prove to be important in the future of education."
3,I have trouble understanding everything that Howard Gardner is explaining,This book is a little over my head and I must push myself to keep reading it. It isn't what I was expecting.
5,Love it!!,I loved this book. It has really helped with my understanding of how people's minds work! It has helped me to become a better teacher!
5,Simply Amazing,"I realize by all means that pop astrology (the stuff you read in the newspapers), is basically not worth the paper its printed on. This book is cheap, and incredible in every sense of the word. I have had 17 out of 17 people read their apropriate sign, and EVERY single one of them either put it down, or were completely blown away, by how incredibly true this book is.I never understood why my ex was such a jerk, until I read this book, (He was an Aries), it makes so much sense.Also,..."
3,Not His Best - But an Interesting Character,"After Midnight is not Laymon's best book in case you haven't read anything else by him. So, don't judge him by this book. After Midnight is a fast read and it narrated by Alice (not her real name of course.) Alice seems to find herself in a jam after accidently killing an intruder. This sets off a night she will remember as the body count just keeps piling up. She does find someone to love during it all, and finds a good friend as well. The book is interesting - Alice is quite an interesting character as she tells you a little about herslf in quips and flashbacks thorughout the story. I give it 3 stars, but as I said, don't judge Laymon by this book. He has better books out there."
5,Good book,This is the third book I have read by Richard Laymon. He is a great writer and his books keep me reading.
4,It found it hard to put down,"I enjoyed the book. Some things I felt needed more explanation than what was given. A little bit more time building a back story, however once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down. Over all I enjoyed it. This is my first book by the author and I will looking for his other books."
1,Huge Disappointment,It's hard to explain exactly how horrible I think the female heroine was written in this book. I can not believe any female would ever act as she had in her position. This heroine had no brain in her head. She got turned on by a trespasser rubbing himself up against a window naked yet thinking about how he was such a disgusting pervert. Understanding that this girl only has a quarter of a brain in her head but to not call the police even though she thought about it was idiotic and that includes her thinking she was safer with her carrying the sword and then blaming someone else for her killing a person. This heroine had a mentality of a 12 year old. I'm normally a fan of Richard Laymon's books but this is one I definitely could have done with out. The two books I have read where he has female heroines have just been horrible.
4,OH ALICE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!?!,"The shock value in laymons After midnight is very high due to the behavior of it's main character....It's the story of a paranoid girl in her twentys named alice whos enjoying a friends house while there on vacation.......The whole story is being told as alice is writeing it but her real name isn't alice and she has alot more surprises for you too...Theres a situation at the house and alice ends up accidentally killing someone, but it wouldn't be the first time....This is a pretty complex story so it's a bit hard to try and tell you some of whats going on here, but it's definately worth picking up and finding out...I loved after midnight because it's just to wacky to be true. Laymon scores again!"
