4,Caillou Gets Into Mommy's Makeup,"This book, ""Caillou and Rosie's Doll"" is a fully illustrated retelling of one of the stories from the television show. Caillou sees his Mommy putting on makeup one morning. He's curious about it, but Mommy warns him not to play with it.Caillou is still fascinated by the whole makeup idea. When Julie the babysitter comes over, he and Rosie play with her for a while, but then Rosie goes off for a nap. Caillou ends up with Rosie's doll and gets the idea to paint a face on her using his paints. He ends up getting caught and worries about getting in trouble.Overall, a pretty good release that mainly follows the television plot. If you or your kids like Caillou, then you'll probably like this well enough. If not, then nothing to see here."
1,waste of money,"I had success with the original Metabolife, but my doctor has taken me off all caffeine, so I thought I'd try these. I was looking for something to curb my appetite since the original version definitely helped with that, but these did no such thing. I haven't found any other benefits from taking these."
1,don't waste your money,nothing to say b/c it did just that...nothing! Only gave it 1 star b/c I had to
2,Caffeine or no Caffeine,I used the MetaboLife with caffeine (red label) and it worked... gave me energy but as far as hunger is concern both caffeine and caffeine free doesn't really do much... so unless you're just pushing to lose that stubborn extra 5 to 10 more pounds then I would suggest to buy the one with caffeine for extra energy but if you're just starting and looking for something to help you with your cravings you might want to look somewhere else.
5,Works,It's the second time I have bought this. Works well when I remember to do it according to the instructions!
3,love it for boosting metabolism,It will not help losing weight but it definitely make you feel awake. I have a lot of energy after this pill for the entire day. Love it. No side effects.
5,Surprisingly Funny,"I asked my 8-year-old son how he like this book. He replied, ""It was surprisingly funny."" I found it to be difinitely off-beat and up-beat. I liked the pairing of the illustrator and the author. As my son also said, ""Mom, wait until you see the Reaper's toenails!"" And, they were hilarious. A great selection for a child who is comfortable with the Grim Reaper, enjoys word play, and appreciates nontraditional illustration."
1,Not a very good shot,"I recently went to a throwers camp and got a chance to throw a brass shot. They are horrible! They may be smaller yeah, but you don't have the same surface area as you do with a regular shot. My advice, if your going to get a shot get the iron cast ones. There so much easier!"
4,"Great series, get it on DVD though","Knights of Ramune is a mecha action comedy that is spiced up with excellent animation, bits of humor, a cool soundtrack, and gratuitous nudity. The story focuses on two Holy Virgins, Cacao and Parfait (who is still in training), a young girl who swings the wrong way, and their mission to find the fourth warrior Ramunes. What is interesting is that Cacao has an ability known as ""Psychic Saturation"" which is a divination technique that involves some ""activity"" that most males will enjoy watching. Moving on, the soundtrack gives me a feeling of nostalgia from the days of 16-bit RPGs, and sounds exactly like something out of Phantasy Star IV. The dubbing, on the other hand, isn't that great, and a downfall in the VHS versions in general is that there are only two episodes on one tape. If anything, buy the DVD, which has the dual-language option, and all six episodes."
5,"Some limits, but it makes up for them","The Gameshark CDX for Dreamcast is probably the best thing that I bought for Dreamcast. Now I can FINALLY beat Dino Crisis. But, there are some flaws. First is that it can be used ONLY in a standard Dreamcast controller. Another is that you need to use the CD that came with it to enter codes. Third and final that I noticed is that the Gameshark could mess up your game. But the third problem is easily avoided by having multiple saves of different files on your VMU. However, some games only let you have 1 saved game on your VMU. So, you just use multiple VMUs for this problem. The cheats do work, so I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to actually be able to beat a game completly. And that would be just about everybody"
5,gamesharks rule,"gamesharks are very fun and comical for example, on NBA 2K i can make the players look like suimo wrestlers or little ants. some games are very fun with gamesharks like goldeneye (64). you should definely get one if you have trouble on a certain game and i am definely getting this prouduct for my dreamcast too."
1,Worst. Product. EVER!,"Seriously, the Gameshark is NOT worth it. Although the GameShark is fun to use, it is just to dangerous. Ever since I used my Gameshark i've lost TONS of data of 1 memory card, and from what i've heard it can even Crash your Dreamcast. stay away from El Diablo and his ever gameshark of doom~The Great Shiro"
4,...dunno if i wanna buy this...,"I got my first gameshark when my playstation (dang defective lasers -_-) and it was one of the greatest things i had ever bought, until one of my files got deleted, which was partly my fault for not making a backup :(. It would be great for my dreamcast, except for the fact that the one game i would use it on (PSO, or Phantasy Star Online)i cant make a copy of!XO But other than that game, i would recomend it for any extreme gamer like myself."
1,Do Not Buy A Dreamcast Gameshark Unless.......,"Do Not Buy A Dreamcast Gameshark Unless....You're ready to purchase a new one every 3 months. I currently own a second Dreamcast Gameshark and let me tell you ... I expected my first Gameshark to last more then 3 months. I take great care of all my Video Gaming equipment and so I saw no excuse what so ever for my Dreamcast Gameshark to last 3months. ... in the Video Game market means you're buying something of high quality or a hot item, which is not the case with the Low Quality DC Gameshark. Now if your Gameshark breaks for no reason what so ever be prepared for the following....1)If you write an e-mail to Interact expect to wait up to 7-10 days just to get a response 2) If you call there 1-900 Troubleshooting Hotline expect to cough up about $10-$25 just for the phone call. Overall the DC Gameshark is a good item to have if you like to cheat in video games. Just remember in 2-5 months be sure to have $ in your pocket plus TAX."
1,A worthless product,"though it is good to buy if you want to advance in games, it is a terrible defective product. I recently owned one about, 4 months ago. For a while, the product would act up and say it can't find the hardware. During the 4th. month, it stopped working. It only says that it can't find the hardware. If you are anxious to waist your money and buy a faulty product, buy the gameshark cdx. If you want to use your money to buy something useful, like a game, then I'd prefer that. On the final words I say, shame on you, Interact. Shame on you."
2,"Good while it lasts, but No Support and and breaks too easy","I have a little son who needs game cheat codes to enjoy the games. I have used it for about two monthes, and I can no longer save new codes. Any new codes I input get erased once I turn off the game console. I have contacted support@gameshark.com by email twice, but not even a return email. Since I can only use codes already in the device, it is only half useful. It is like a light bulb; you need it, but you better have a spare."
1,"Sounds Good, but more of a pain than it's worth","I'm a pretty good gamer, but sometimes there's a few little hidden ""extras"" in a game worth checking out. GameShark lets you do it. If you're patient. And have a lot of time. And don't mind HOPING that your codes work after you swith the GS disc with the game. And don't care that it doesn't fit in port 1, so many games it works for can't even use it. ...."
5,Heater hose and hose to overflow pressure tank,"This hose is a Y shape with special fittings. It connects to the water pump at one end and then the 2 branches of the Y connect at the bottom of the overflow / pressure tank and at the firewall on the quick connect fitting. In order to remove the existing quick connect fitting, you have to compress the plastic tabs while pulling off the connector with the hose. My factory hose had a molded black plastic fitting securing it to the quick connector. I was able to use a small wire cutter to cut off this plastic fitting and recover the quick connector to use with this new hose secured by a standard clamp. Definitely well built this hose is a must."
1,Please...,"Can't believe SAMS did this to us. I can only assume nepotism here. Free CDRom? HA. Sorry, couldn't give this one away.An excruciatingly painful read (not that I actually finished it). I am just glad to see that I wasn't the only sucker who opened this 'book'."
1,"What is this, 1982?","Cyberpunks? The authors of this monstrosity should be embarrassed. Nice cover, though."
3,An Interesting Biography,James Grant does a fair job. Baruch does come across as a likeable personality. The author perhaps could have been a little more critical in his analysis and also focussed on Baruch's private life and public years after 1945 a bit more.
1,sailing away,pure junk flimsy and not even usuable - I threw it away Sorry!!!! too bad you can't rate it a zero
1,Easily the worst of the Duke Nukem series,"After waiting since April (the original release date!) for this game to come out, all I can say is: What a disappointment! If you thought Time to Kill looked unpolished, wait till you see this game! The graphics are spotty, there are barely any enemies, and it seems that more than two or three animated objects on the screen at once causes the framerate to creep down close to zero. Worst of all, Duke now speaks as if he's sitting on the john; his previously humorous quips are now ruined by a whiney, strained voice. All in all, a VERY disappointing effort to continue the series; this is a real shame, as I was formerly a huge Duke fan. Shame on Infogrames and everyone else involved for this sorry attempt."
5,Great pictures and graphics!!!!!,"This book is great, especially the pictures which give me something to go by. The main reason i like this book is the pictures, graphics, and the easy to follow directions. It also gives tips and other ideas to get your creativity flowing. I would recommend it for pre-teens, teens, and kids who have help from parents. However the projects do require products that you probably won't just have laying around your house. But this is a fantastic book and has really cool ideas even if you do have to go out and buy some stuff. Some of the projects are snow globe, glow in the dark bracelets, decorated pads of paper, cards, exotic box, collages, soap, lip gloss, mosaic mirror, flowers, frames,rug, hair clips, bracelet, decorated pen, duck tape wallet, mathbox pop star shines, and more!! My favorite craft would have to be the post card beach bag."
3,The Crafty Divas DIY,"Much to my surprise, many of the crafts requires the purchase of other products. I was under the impression with DIY crafts, one would use items already in the home."
1,Dull...cliched....dull...,Not a good book! I was really disapointed in this book. The plot was slow to get started and when it did so much was left out I lost interest. I've been reading sci-fi and romance books for years and this book is so cliche ridden I had trouble getting through the first 2 chapter without laughing. I haven't read any of Miss Gail other books and may not after this.
5,Another great classic!,People that enjoy the history channel will love this. I believe it would be a great item for a speech class to be exposed to!
5,Opera Review,"Another wonderful compilation. Would be glad to see a compilation with the Opera diva's of now.Ghiergiiou, Cecilia Bartoli, Von-Stadt, Battle, Graves, Nebtrenko.kele Agi"
4,Lush and Definitive,"The Amazon review is indeed way off the mark. The performances here are lush and definitive, without hard edges. The Nocturnes span the gamut of emotion just as they should. The only reasons this does not merit a fifth star (from me at least) is that there are intrusive performer noises-music stands clattering, I think, and the overall recording is a trifle distant for my tastes. All that aside, for several years, this has been my benchmark."
4,Used it once.,Used only one time (so far) but worked well. Caution...don't leave the finished cake in the pan too long. Remove in about ten minutes after removing from the oven.
4,Great pan,"So far this is a great pan for me. it is not quite so non-stick as some of the review have mentioned- but I am using cooking spray rather than the standard butter and flouring of the pan.It is reasonably heavy weight material, but when it is full of batter it is easier to put it on a cookie sheet to get it in and out of the oven. In fact, my very first cake in the pan came out of the pan in pieces - and I think it's because I flexed pretty severely when getting the pan out of the oven."
4,Great pan . . .,"I'm a baker. Bought this pan because nothing can be more annoying than making a great cake and having part of it stick to the pan, even with proper preparation. This eliminates that problem completely and creates consistency. For those stating this pan bakes unevenly, it can. However, the instructions do suggest adjusting the oven to a slightly lower temperature, as the areas of the cake that rest on a supporting cookie sheet may brown more darkly that the sides. You can also bake the cake on a pan for support for the majority of the cooking time, then remove the cookie sheet and carefully set the pan on the oven rack to finish baking and to evenly brown the sides. A good baker is always in control of variables and should know how to manipulate temperatures or the position of the item inside the oven to create a fabulous product. Great Pan!"
2,Crashed but Outlet Honored the Refund,"I owned an earlier version of this recorder that I still use and have had minimal problems over a two year period. This item was ordered as a refurbished machine but crashed within 24 hours after I started to use it. Thus, there is little I can say about it. This review is more about the 3rd party vendor that sold it to me. Over the course of three days with some starts and stops in communication the vendor (Outlet based in CA) honored the return and expedited my refund. They also refunded my shipping charge in full so that I lost only my time spent in setting up, breaking down, repackaging and getting it to the UPS store. If I see their name again when ordering something I would not hesitate to do business with them again, because I know that the risk would be diminished by their business practices."
5,great unit-great recorder but must get the right type of dvd disc,great unit-great recorder-had unit for lest then a year no trouble yet but must get the right brand of blank dvds to record to(see the manual for recommended disc)the only issue i had with the manual was it was xerox copy of the manual not he real manual from the fac..the unit i bought came from a refurbish vendor..overall i'm very happy i bought this unit...so far
3,The least expensive source for this item on the web!lja/JMJ,It was OK until it stopped working......long time ago!...OK OK OK OK Ok Ok ok ok ok ok oklja/JMJ
2,Seems thrown together,"It's as if they bought a cheap VCR and a cheap DVD drive and jammed them in a box together, and trained them on the same remote. There's only one tuner, so you can't record one program while watching another. Up-conversion is very poor, I could not find any setting where a 4:3 (old fashioned standard broadcast TV, also 16 mm film) program would play at the correct aspect ratio. That is, you will not see round circles, letter boxed or not. Since most of my video collection is 4:3, I had to replace this unit when I bought a modern television.The DVD drive failed after a couple of years. This box is now e-waste."
2,DVD-DVR recorder,"I gave this to my husband for his birthday, June 11. He still hasn't figured out how to make it work right, and he isn't a novice in these things. I wonder how the normal, average person would cope with it. I'm not sure what the issues are, but it certainly isn't intuitive at all."
4,Sure beats the Panasonic DMR-EZ47V,"Initially, I bought the Panasonic DMR-EZ47V, based on Consumer Report's high ranking. It was a glitchy, slow, maddening disaster. I returned it and got this Philips, and so far, no complaints. Turns on and changes digital channels reasonably quickly. Remote control makes sense. Doesn't crash unexpectedly. Pretty low standards, I realize, but after the Panasonic, I'm happy to have a machine that does the basics."
1,What a piece of JUNK! And forget customer service!,"I am on a replacement unit---which turns out to be worse than the first. This machine's VHS recording results are so poor that you cannot tell what you are watching. This machine will play BUT NOT record to DVD.And, Philip's customer service is anything but service. They continually put you off, insisting that they can only assist you by having someone return your call---and, of course, the return call never comes.Save time, money, and negative feelings --- STAY away from Philip's products."
4,Great machine; when it's working,"I bought this 7 months ago and fell in love with it despite the fact that my machine was defective and kept locking up on me. Customer service at Philips is great, they had me pay shipping to return the machine, then sent a new one out (a month later). This one is great. I can play ""finalized"" CDs on all my other players, but the chapter marks I added don't carry over. Up until now, it received my over-the-air signal in exemplary fashion, but the tuner has appeared to have given out. I could watch TV while when I had a tape stopped, could watch a tape while recording a DVD from TV, could easily dub all my VHS tapes (in real time). Philips is willing to replace my machine again now that my tuner stopped working, I just pay shipping to them. The hardest part is going without my beloved machine for a month. It's really wonderful when it's working like it should."
3,could be better,"Player will only upscale with HDMI input. Not mentioned; also, must push button to switch from digital to analog channels rather than channeling up/down thru all. Still, good tuner/player/recorder for $120"
4,Good item since it has a built in tuner,This is a great VCR/DVD combo with built in tuner but a little problematic to set up to the TV. It took many tries to get it to work properly and was frustrating but once set up it is good. The DVR taping is very complicated but we mostly bought it for VCR recording and playback while watching another channel on the TV. Would recommend as it is hard to find VCR's on the market now with a tuner and it seems to be working properly.
3,Not sure about this product,"My wife and I purchased this product on Sept 15. We finally gotten time to hook this up. On our first t.v., we could not get the thing to work proper. This was being connected to our cable box. On our second T.V. we was not able to get this product to function either, this was hooking directly from the dvd/vcr to the t.v.Our other vcr/dvd would work fine once the cables was hooked up. This thing is not as simple to use. There is too many setups to go through. With todays technology everything should be plug and play, not read instructions, try and setup, re-read instructions, again try to set up, and then re-read the instructions again just to finally give up.I have a friend that is an electronics wiz, so will probably have him stop by and see if he can figure this thing out. Otherwise our only choice is to return this and hope the next one we get will be easier to use."
5,great product,I like the HDMI connection and the picture on my TV. Great one-touch VHS to DVD transfer feature. Easy to use and a value at the price I paid.
1,Didn't work on timer when using daily recording,"This product only works if you don't use the ""daily"" timer programing. For instance I wanted to tape a soap that comes on M-F at the same time each day. I programmed it and it taped the show and when I went to watch it, I couldn't get it to turn on because it was programmed for everyday and nothing worked except to unplug and manually remove my tape.I returned it and had a replacement sent, but I have not tried to use the multi-day timer, but for a single program it works ok. That is only the VCR portion of this recorder, I have yet to try the DVDR recording option."
2,VCR rewind problem,Unit performs very nicely except for excessive pressure placed on the tape at the end of rewind which causes the tape to be pulled off the reel.Philips is going to replace the unit. It turns out that the replacementmachine has a different tape transport problem which causes audio distortion and unstable video toward the end of the tape.
4,No problems so far,"Philips DVP3345V/17 DVD/VCR ComboSo far this unit has performed flawlessly. The picture quality surprised me by how good it is. This was the best value since I needed a combo that has a built-in tuner. I use this product every day. I have recorded both to dvd and vcr and from dvd to vcr and vice versa with no difficulty (knock on wood). The only way I have not recorded is from my camcorder to the unit so I can't verify that it does this function. The one curious thing I've noted is that I had a Magnavox combo previously and the menus are the same. And most of the functions and keys worked the exact same way. The Philips unit is not as picky as to the brand of dvdr discs. So far I've used generic(compusa blank media) and maxell brand media and no problems there either. IMHO, this is a good unit for the money and I'm very pleased with my purchase."
2,Don't buy refurbished units.,"I bought 2 refurbished units, one for my dad and one for me. The main selling points were the digital tuner and recordable to either vhs or disk. Dad's dvd wouldn't open at all and had to be sent back for a replacement but had to do some real fighting with the company that claimed to have ""refurbished"" it. Now mine's vcr isn't working.There was dust on the inside all over the dvd tray. The tracking is broken on the vcr and of course the 30 day so called warrenty is past. At least the tuner and dvd recorder still works. Sounds like the brand new ones aren't much better.9-17-09 update: I sent mine back and the current one is working so far. Dad's replacement one had something go wrong with the vcr portion so he quit using it. That makes one out of four units that is still working so far in just 5 months."
1,Can't record HBO!,"I record very few shows, but one that I like to watch is ""Inside the NFL"" on HBO. When I tried to record it, I found that I couldn't record a nice clear picture with the DVD, but instead had to record a fuzzy, blurry picture with the VCR. After investigating online I found out this was due to the copy protection scheme on HBO, which does not allow recording in +VR mode.Online it was suggested that I try recording on a DVD-RAM disc. Since I had already bought a number of these to archive important things, I put one in and tried to record. That was when I found the biggest flaw in this machine: IT DOES NOT ACCEPT DVD-RAM DISCS!!! DVD-RAM discs are so much better for archiving important videos that I am amazed any company would make a DVD recorder that only accepts everything EXCEPT DVD-RAM."
4,a good design guide,The author does a good job of telling you which XML features to leverage and which to stay away from. This book is a general design guide for software that needs to produce/consume XML (but is not a reference for the low-level details of coding)
3,Pass On This One,"I've been using XML for about six years and found this book to repeat the common already understood best practices. I was expecting this book to bring new ideas to light but instead it focused on common design practices already understood within the XML community (i.e. do I make a piece of data an element or a attribute?). To the authors credit he does give very thorough explainations and he knows XML well. I guess more than anything this book didn't match my expectations, however it is a well written and would work for folks new to the XML community."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A lot of the artwork here is reminiscent of your independent black and white style stuff, which, I suppose, is not too surprising in a case like this.The text is of course what is supposed to feature.The highlight would be the work on Zane Grey's Tigre.The cartoon style on the Brigadier Gerard and Captain Blood stories is nifty, as well."
5,'I Want to be Caliph instead of the Caliph,"Iznogoud is the evil Grand Vizier to the good-natured but slow-witted Caliph of Baghdad Haroun al Plassid. Wanting desperately to be `Caliph instead of the Caliph.' , he comes up continuously with plans to get rid of the incumbent , which always backfire on the miserable Iznogoud.Iznogoud's penchant for evil invention, together with the charming illustrations and witty dialogue makes for charming albums, by the same people who brought you Asterix.In fact in `Asterix and the Magic Carpet' a reference is made to Iznogoud, as Asterix and friends is to battle against Watzisname, Iznogoud's evil cousin in India, in order to save the lovely Princess Orinjade.I was given a couple of these books, as a present when I was eight, and absolutely loved them."
2,NOT like Asterix,"I was expecting to receive something similar to Asterix and Obelix, but the color, the history and the drawings are very poor compared to Asterx"
5,Great overview of MFT theory,"This was one of the required texts for my Advanced Theory class in Marriage and Family Therapy. I actually read this one cover to cover! I was pleased with the level of detail and clear and concise way each of the major theories were presented. Each chapter contains several case studies used to illustrate the various concepts and interventions that distinguish each of the approaches. In addition to learning the origins of the field from Bowen, Satir, and Minuchin, the newer solution-focused and narrative approaches are included as well plus a discussion on intergrating approaches into a unique, cohesive, and meaningful approach. I found this book to be more insightful than my introduction to theory text and recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about marriage and family therapy."
5,really great book,Great summaries of different theoretical approaches to working with families including techniques and where the theory originated from.
5,Great Resource,This is one of the best textbooks I have encountered for the beginning family therapist. It offers great theoretical explanation with helpful application to everyday practice. I would recommend it to anyone!
5,The title accurately describes the text!,"This is a clear, concise and informative text that outlines the fundementals of family therapy. The title accurately describes the text. A must for those who are entering into family therapy!"
3,Sprial Staircase,Suberb book! Should be REQUIRED reading for every person who is seeking a more spiritual life.
4,Inner Peace,"Reading this book helped me to get through a dark time in myself, as well as, learn more about myself, my reason for where I am at and why I am where I am at."
3,May I suggest,"Karen Armstrong is a good writer. But when you get right down to it, she is wishy-washy. She can't seem to make up her mind. She wants the trappings of faith without commitment, scholarship without dedication, and belief without God. I am sorry, but you can't have it both ways. A much better and intellectually more honest title for Armstrong's book would be: ""Can't Make Up My Mind"". Or ""How to Pretend: A Skeptical Believer"". Don't waste your time on ""The Spiral Staircase"". Take the time instead to read Dorothy Day's ""The Long Loneliness"" or ""Surprised by Joy"" by C.S. Lewis."
5,Written From The Heart,"I listen to Karen Armstrong's History of God often and I just love her work. Before reading this book I only knew little about her personal life and experiences, and the rumors were not helping at all.This book was really eye-opening and I enjoyed reading it a great deal. I enjoy reading the last 20 pages when she talks about compassion for other religions and people even more.I recommend this book to whomever who has stopped believing in God."
4,A life spent searching lands.,"Karen Armstrong's most recent book covers her time after leaving the convent, completing her education, and finding her way in the world. I am so very, very thankful to her for her honesty in her spiritual struggles and her own journey. I wish more people would be as honest about their questions. Many people could be helped if we were to nurture a forgiving and gracious culture that allows others to open up, being honest about their failures, mistakes, guilt and questions."
1,Spiral Staircase To Allah,This is what this woman has done for herself. She has become a parrot and apologist for everything and anything the Muslim world does nowadays. She can look away at the fanaticism of an increasingly rabid Muslim world meanwhile overly criticizing everything and anything the Christian religion stands for and upholds.This woman is nothing but a salacious pop historian who knows who to pick on and all the right buttons to push. This is why she is one of the mainstays for mediocre documentaries on the History Channel.
5,a gem of truth in a muddy land,"Ths book should be required reading for all those making our foreign policy in this country, for all religious leaders, all religious people, all atheists, and all those who are not sure. It should be required of all those claiming certainty, all those claiming self-satisfaction and all those condemning others for their beliefs. If only ten-percent of our population had reached a level of spiritual maturity near that of Ms. Armstrong's we would have far fewer problems in this world. If just one-third of people ever came to realize, as she did, that our belief-system/religion/spirituality is an unending path, not a fait-accompli, we would be well on our way to a society we could all be proud of, instead of one we just shake our heads at."
1,One staircase I wish I had not climbed,"I really loathed this book, and I use the word carefully. I've read books that I may not have liked before, but never have I read one that left me bristling with irritation. While I have empathy for Karen Armstrong's story and struggles, spiritual, physical and otherwise, I found her descriptions - which were labored, repetitive, and smacking of victimhood - to be unrelentingly self-indulgent. For all of the esteem issues she wrestles with, I found her musings, whether discussing life at Oxford, on television, her writing projects etc so often to be intellectually arrogant. Was it reflective - yes, tediously so. But was it insightful - God no."
5,The Spiral Staircase,This book is as compelling as a novel as well as being challenging & inspiring. We used it for a study group and everyone enjoyed it & thought it well worthwhile. Everyone found it easy to read but not easy to put down!
4,Loved it!,I thought all 5 of them were funny! Each one has their own unique style so individual tastes will vary depending on what you like. My personal faves were the last girl (Vijai) & the last guy (Vidur.) OMG they had me LMAO!! Those 2 I will be watching out for. The other 3 were good but didn't stand out as particularly memorable.
4,Review on Civilizing the West,The dvd was funny. All the comedians were funny in there own way which made it all the more better. Hopefully there will be another tour.Peace
1,"Not worth your time, Russell Peters is NOT in this video.","I rented this video after searching for Russell Peters. I am not sure why this video appeared, he is not in the video at all. There are 5 other ""comedians"", but as another reviewer mentioned, only the last one is even remotely funny. This should be entitled ""Indian Open Mic Night"" because they are amateurs. It might be slightly funnier if you are from India. Otherwise, it's a complete waste of money.Also, I used Amazon's ""Unbox"" software to DL and watch the video. It's choppy and video and audio were out of sync. Still better than Netflix, though."
1,Not as Described,"Item was not as it was described. The item is describes as a 1/2"" antibacklash nut but does not tell you what type of the thread it has. This is important depending on your application. I was looking for the 1/2"" ACME single start thread. The nut has some type of spiral thread in it. I returned the item and Small Parts did not acknowledge that they received the return part. I contacted Amazon approximately two weeks after the return and they promptly refunded the purchase price plus my shipping expense."
4,Nice sound improvement,"I give a log of presentations on my PowerBook, and they always have audio, and no one was ever able to hear the audio through my tiny built-in speakers. I bought this specifically for presentations. Though it comes with a power cord, it runs find on bus power, so there are no extra power cords to plug in to use it.I didn't think that the USB bus would provide enough power to generate substantial loudness, but it does. This thing sounds nice and loud and clear. It's just what I needed. I haven't tried the USB extension ports on the front. They may or may not work well.I docked a star for interface design. It doesn't look like there's a power button, and when I couldn't get it to work I panicked. But the big ""dial"" on the front of the device is a power button. So it's not entirely intuitive. However, it is pretty, and it works."
3,track and field,For the price it's worth buying for several practices and for Jr. High. Don't buy for meets or competion--it is strictly for practices and beginners.
1,OUTRAGIOUS SHIPPING FEE!!,"I cancelled the order because the shipping fee was way out of line, costing more than the product itsself."
4,A refreshingly candid read about NASA. A great modern memoir.,"Mike Mullane has written about his experience at NASA in the Space Shuttle 'glory days' as he calls it. I really enjoyed this memoir, he leaves nothing out of his experiences on the way to NASA, his time there, and how and why he left. It's not a technically heavy book and concentrates on the experiences of an astronaut and the people around them. I particularly enjoyed his rants about NASA management and his overall candid view of operations in the space program. Mike does not hold back his judgment towards various groups like his peers, civilian astronauts, scientist astronauts, NASA management, the Challenger disaster, the military mentality and especially women.As a shortcoming it can be very wordy and overly descriptive and could have been about 50 pages shorter with the same content.Overall though, it's laugh out loud funny at points (especially from a male perspective) (and uncensored) and a good read.8/10"
5,excellent insight,"Well I don't really need to add another glowing review but I just finished this book and want to anyway. This book provides exceptional insight into what it is like to aspire, achieve and fulfill the dream of being a NASA astronaut. The book covers the life of Mike Mullane from the time he was a child looking at the sky, through three shuttle flights to after his retirement. In addition to a personal perspective, there are also many details about the inner workings of NASA itself, both technical and management, including new (to me) details of the Challenger disaster. The story is not always pretty.This book is not about hero worship. Mr. Mullane was certainly a competent astronaut but was not exceptional. He wanted to be an astronaut for the personal experience, not as a power play to be exalted. Perhaps it is the ""common man"" element that makes the story so satisfying. Thanks for writing your story, Mr Mullane, I greatly appreciate it."
5,"Great book, excellent writing.","This has got to be one of the best books I've read on the Shuttle program, NASA, and life of Astronauts. Inside details of vomiting, toilet troubles, sleeping and all kinds of personal details you don't get from the cleaned up NASA press releases. Good stuff, Mike Mullane is a great story teller, and can bring you to tears laughing at his misadventures, and crying at the tragic losses experienced in the shuttle program. Very worthwhile reading."
4,Politically Incorrect Astronaut Bio from Shuttle Era,"It seems that every Mercury, Gemini and Apollo astronaut had a bio written and I have read a lot of them. So it was very interesting to read this story of the Space Shuttle era. Mullane seems to go out of his way to be politically incorrect - he calls his group planet Arrested Development. But he is often humorous and provides good insights into the shuttle years at NASA."
5,A Must Read...,"Riding Rockets has got to be, in my honest opinion, the best astronaut written autobiography so far. It gives you insights not only into NASA, but also the personnel, and the astronauts of the period. Mr. Mullane spells out not only the joys and wonders of space flight, but also the fears that come along with climbing into a vehicle powered by highly explosive materials. He also gives insights into the fears of the families, and the anguish they go through each launch attempt, as well as each scrub. This is an excellant read and I highly recommend it to any wanna be astronauts, as well as anyone interested in the NASA history."
3,"OK, but a bit too bio-centric.","Mullane tells some interesting stories, but there were too many references to bodily functions even for me (a lifelong Beavis & Butthead fan). I loved his stories about growing up in the beginning of the book, but it got sort of repetitive at the end.If you are interested in the Challenger accident, there is a great deal of information about it in this book. Mullane lost close friends in that event.I preferred Jerry Linenger's ""Off The Planet"", which covers a lot of the same physiological topics but from a more academic perspective."
4,Inside NASA,Mullane delivers the unseen truth behind the aastronauts training and the unfortunate politics in NASA. It is a fascinating read.
3,Almost disappointed,"A bit too much of toilet and sex humour, a bit too little of space tech stuff. I strongly suspect there was more interesting stuff to tell. Almost disappointed."
4,"Rockets, Reality, Reason, and Remorse","This was a surprising read. I loved this book, but it has two very distinct sides. One is funny, self-confident, brash, accomplished. The other is grim, unsure, depressing, an expose of institutional politics and culture at it's soul (and life) destroying worst. It's not all photo ops and champange. This is why I like it and yet sometimes found it hard to read. From childhood to semi-retirement, this is about a person, the flaws he honestly admits to, and the not so 'Leave it to Beaver' world he lives in. The first part was very entertaining and anecdotal- very funny. The second was more interesting and down to the nitty gritty: an inside account of what NASA was like, and still may be like. It also exposes how the media, and having to deal with the media, changes how people respond and behave. The true stresses of this kind of life and career are huge. It wasn't the book I thought it would be, but I am very glad to have read it."
4,Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Shuttle Astronaut,"A great relief to read this down-to-earth story of one astronaut's experiences. There is a serious side to it also; and it answers many down-to-earth questions of the astronaut training and experience that most people would like to ask, but would never have the opportunity. A very humerous presentation by someone with a great sense of humor, who does not take himself too seriously."
1,Jail Bait Heroine Again...,"I generally enjoy Joan Wolf's regencies but this one, a romance with a 17 year old girl, was not very interesting. After all, she is just a girl and would be considered jail bait here in the U.S.A. and rightly so. While people generally married at a much younger age in those days, it would have been better, from a sexual, romantic and relationship point of view to have our heroine perhaps 19???? Sexual scenes with such young girls are sort of creepy. My niece is 17, for goodness sakes. And she is far from mature. Besides, how interesting is a 17 year old? Not much..."
3,Middle-European Kingdom,"Mediocre Joan Wolf romance, not as good as the Guardian or the Deception, but will satisfy whose looking for romance in written form.""Middle-European"" Prince needs British aristocratic ""HEROINE"" virgin to marry quickly so to qualify for country's expectations. Ho hum!"
1,This is the first Joan Wolf novel I have read. Yuchh!,This is one of those novels that make you wonder what the author was thinking. Three quarters of the way through this novel I realized the guy in this story needed to go back to his mother and GROW up. Will I read another Joan Wolf novel? Noooo!
1,I wish I'd read the reviews before buying.,"I love Joan Wolf's books and bought this one without even checking the reviews. That was my first mistake. My second mistake was reading all of it. This book made me very uncomfortable. The heroine, Charity, is described as a VERY small, flat-chested girl who looks fourteen and fails to reach the hero's shoulders. I have a very hard time imagining a passionate romance between a little girl and a grown man. Nor do I want to. As for the mystery angle I was never allowed to become involved in it...everything was explained as soon as it was introduced. The secondary characters were very one dimentional and uninteresting. I sincerely hope that Ms. Wolf returns to her above par writing with her next book, but you can bet I'll check the reviews before I buy it."
1,Bad Romance...,"I did not like this story at all. I wish too I had read the reviews before I bought this book. I won't make that mistake again. Charity might have been 17-18 years old when she married Prince Augustus, but she looked like a child. What romance is there (that adult women would want to read...)about a flat chested teenager with a grown-up man? That is not my recipe for romance or a good story. True, many women (girls) married younger back than, but many were disfigured via small pox and romance writers do not include that in their stories either. Wait for the next Joan Wolf story and don't bother with this one. But make sure you check the reviews first..."
3,"Good read, but disappointing","I have previously enjoyed Joan Wolf's books among them Golden Girl and the Poisoned Serpent. However I was disappointed with Her weak portrayal of Charity. It wasn't as much the fact that charity was portrayed as a young girl. That actually works in the story as Wolf goes on to show that charity was much mature for her age. I disliked the fact that charity was so easily accepting of Gus's infidelity. I don't care what kind of a woman you are but you don't easily accept your husband back into your arms after he's cheated on you. Furthermore, Wolf does not delve into Gus and Charity's characters as much as she could have, and basically leaves the reader ignorant of their emotional lives. overall, I would say royal bride was an interesting read, but it could have been better. I hope to see better works from this author."
2,disappointing,"Let me begin by saying that I love Joan Wolf novels. It pains me to admit that this one fell short of her usual mark. While interesting at the outset, I found this heroine to be weak and the hero a little overbearing. ""Royal Bride"" reminds me of books I've read that date back about 10 years or more, when it was en vogue to have a very young heroine whose character was somewhat molded by the hero. That's not my cup of tea, but it may work for others. At any rate, this was not Wolf's best work. If you want her best stuff, find one or more of the following: The Pretenders, The Gamble, The Guardian, The Arrangement, or The Deception. All of those are excellent books, unique in part because Wolf chose to narrate them in the first person, from the heroine's perspective--very entertaining!"
1,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to another Joan Wolf romance but this one let me down. I like her novels written in the first person best so I knew from the start that this wouldn't be one of my favorites but the story didn't do anything for me either. There were no surprises, little character development and the romance was dull. I haven't given up on her yet, though, and hope that the next one is better."
1,Did Joan Wolf really write this book?,"I'm a great admirer of this author, and absolutely love the books she has written in first person. However, Royal Bride, written in third person, is not even the same caliber as ""The Guardian."" The cardboard characters were extremely disappointing, although the basic story plot held intriguing promise. The hero does uncharacteristically idiotic things and the heroine, while supposedly so smart, is incredibly passive. It's almost as if the writer dusted off an old manuscript of a very early, unpublished attempt at writing regency. As an avid consumer of romance, I buy her books without even checking inside the covers because I've been so satisfied with her writing. I'm very confused and disappointed. I hope Ms. Wolf will go back to writing in the first person at the high caliber we expect."
3,Buyer Beware,"Diskeeper may indeed be the best defrag utility ever, but it does have some highly frustrating attributes. Almost all of the automated features it has result in the computer being ""taken over"" by Diskeeper at the most inopportune times. Nothing like playing a game when suddenly Diskeeper decides its going to defrag the drive and zap almost 100% of the system resources for an undetermined period of time.It works OK when defragging manually, but stear clear of any of its automatic or scheduled features!"
3,ALMOST a good program.,"Something like this is undoubtedly necessary, and Diskeeper MAY be the best available too, but it's buggy. The ""set it and forget it"" feature doesn't work at all; when an automatic defragmentation should begin, the program pops up a message saying it can't continue due to inconsistencies on the disk. The first two or three times this happened (this is on an XP Home system), I scheduled ChkDisk, rebooted, etc. But (a) there wasn't anything wrong with the disk, and (b) it didn't solve the problem with Diskeeper. Now, when I see that message, I open Diskeeper and start the defragmentation manually. Sometimes the program refuses to do a manually started defragmentation, saying there's an inconsistency; but there IS no inconsistency, and when I restart the defragmentation, it works just fine. In addition, directory consolidation does NOT put all the directories together, and it takes forever. The hard-drive is only 20% utilized, so don't start thinking of excuses for this!"
1,Too much for too little,"$45 for a utility that does the same thing as the built-in WinXP defragmenter? I don't think so. The only real advantage this has over WinXPs defragmenter (which happens to be the ""lite"" version of Diskeeper) is that it can defragment the Windows paging file--and that can make a real performance difference, so here's what you do.Download the 30-day trial version. Set your paging file to a fixed size (set the minimum and max to the recommended max size, or a little more). Install and run the trial version to defragment the paging file. Done. Let the trial expire, and use the built-in Windows defragmenter from now on."
2,me smell phoney baloney,"I don't want to completely dis any book. After all, lots of work goes into a book, even one that doesn't have the ring of truth."
4,Further Stuff Needed,"I advocate computer handicapping and calculated risk taking. If you are an experienced horseplayer and disciplined, then this is a MUST HAVE book. Structured play and avoiding bad bets will produce profits in racing. The claimed edge is the observation that the public desires action and plays too many races with the same methodology. If players/readers can remain disciplined and only play value races according to their methodology, then the profits are there--how much, how frequent, and how spottable are your problems."
3,A simple but complex system,"This book is a well explained system for a fan who wants to become a pace handicapper. Pace handicapping has many different and sometimes complicated approaches written by many different writers. This I found is one of the more easier to use, but pace handicapping is a supplemental tool at best. This writer points this out and goes to great lanks to explain this. I would have rated it higher except I do not like commercials in my books and the writer sells software. However, the approach is very sound and I will incorporate some of the ideas in my own handicapping."
2,The only way to profit at the track consistently,"The ONLY way to make money at horse tracks in the US, (ones that use the pari mutual betting system) is to consistently identify and bet on overlays, let me say that again, consistently identify and bet on overlays. With the enormous track take, and the nickel, dime, etc. breakage, there are some races where there are no overlays. Any ""system"" that does not include odds analysis will eventually lose money, period."
3,Handicapping Magic,"This book definitely gave me confidence in handicapping the races with examples inside. I tried to find races that I could apply the system the author describes but was hard pressed to find any. I guess if you like to try to handicap races this book might be of some help. Overall, I don't think that it applies to many race past performances of today."
1,Not impressed.,"The thing was touchy from day one. After using it three times, it quit working. Found one in town about a week later for roughly the same price. Picked it up to save the hassle, and low and behold, four uses later, it stops working.Im not impressed with this product at all. Construction is shoddy and the item feels cheap. The slide action for the console is laughable, and both units had a tendancy to stick. This item isnt even worth the cost of ground shipping."
4,"Helpful, but...","Nice POSIX examples. Yes, I'm nit-picking, but the cover says the book is ""comprehensive"" and a comprehensive book is 800 pages, not 412 pages. You might also want to consider ""Bash Shell: Essential Programs for Your Survival at Work"" by Larry L. Smith"
1,Look elsewhere,"I ended up going back to my old shell scripting book from 1990. It's better than this one - at least the description of quoting, pattern matching, arrays, uh just about everything is better than this book. Buying this book was a mistake that you can avoid.I have some of the old New Riders books and they were pretty good, but I guess now that Sams bought them, the editing quality has taken a sharp downward turn. I never liked Sams books (except for Don Lancaster's)."
3,Spacey and Humourous,"This is an oddball album indeed. Mix together a little Hawkwind and Pink Floyd, with some Tom Jones thrown in for good measure...give it the kind of sense of humour you might find on the British sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf, and you get an idea of what lies in store for you on this album. Captain Sensible is a major contributor, playing bass and keyboards, but it isn't much like his solo stuff or his work with The Damned. Along with original material, it has a tongue in cheek cover of ""It's Not Unusual"" and a fairly straightforward cover of ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"". It's not a great album, but it has its moments, though watch out for that import price! 3 1/2 stars."
5,The best Mantovani collection of inspirational music,"I have been waiting for years in the hopes that this magnificent collection would finally be re-released on CD. Of all the songs in the colection, none is better than the Mantovani Orchestra performing ""The Holy City"". No other orchestra has ever duplciated the awesome depth of that song. The first song, ""A Mighty Fortress"" thunders through the speakers with an authority that raises the hair on your neck; the quietness of ""Little Brown Church in the Valley"" sends the mind back to quiet Sundays in years long lost. Highly recommended."
3,What was the point?,"I wanted so much to like this book and I did up until the ""Letter To Benjamin"". I am not a prude by any stretch of the imagination but certain sections and details of her letter were more than I could bear. I tried to put myself in the position of Benjamin as a young adult reading the letter--does he really need to read how a former lover had to lift his stomach to penetrate his mother? Or how another potential suitor apparently didn't want to ""f**k her""? I found it hard to see how these details really added anything to her story. While I appreciate her willingness to share her history and life experiences with her son, I think this may be a classic case of overkill. There are better ways to leave a legacy."
4,"A Great Game, but not as good as Hitman 2.","This is most definetely a great game. It nails originality, and the graphics are very good for when the game was released. However, if fans of Hitman 2 are going to backtrack, they will run into some problems. The sequel (on PS2) allowed you to switch between first and trird-person perpectives, this one is all third person. Because of that, camera problems do arise. Second of all, Hitman 2 was on 3 major consoles, so it reached out to a different audience. Those who prefer console gaming, or are used to playing Hitman on PS2 will notice that a keyboard and mouse does not help the controls, but actually hurts them. It is a great game, but you will probably enjoy it more if you haven't been spoiled by Hitman 2."
4,"Original, but flawed","The concept of a game in which the protagonist is a professional killer hired to assassinate targets is, to my knowledge a new idea. The missions which followed this concept were very fun. However, there are only a few missions like that. Many other missions are far too long for a game without a save feature. Many missions are just stupid such as the ones in the jungle, and when you have to deactivate a nuclear weapon (why does EVERY game have you defusing a nuke nowadays.) I would have given this game 5 stars if all the missions were assassinations.The excellent physics engine and graphics were very impressive. The AI was pretty good as well. The plot of the game was poor at best.One thing to be aware of is that you need a high end computer to run this game without major bugs. I originally installed it on a 500 mhz system, where it frequently crashed. However, when I put it on my 1 Ghz it ran smoothly and without errors."
1,I thought that I was going mad...............,"..Until I read Rob Matthews' review of this game. I am also stuck on the training mission. I never got past it since I would go up the elevator, shoot a guard and then wind up at the beginning. This is a bug to end all bugs. It felt like I was in that Star Trek episode where they kept repeating the same day over and over again.I had high hopes for this game..."
2,Buy Deus Ex,"After purchasing Deux Ex and falling in love with that game, I looked within the Eidos family to find another FPS with the same kind of action and functionality as Deus Ex, after reading many good reviews on Hitman I decided to give it a day in court. I just want to say that Hitman is a satisfying game in its own right, but when compared to Soldier of Fortune and Deus Ex it simply can't hold its water. So I urge you to give Deus Ex a try, and give Hitman a go only if you have a day to spare to fly through it."
3,I'll trade you my sniper rifle for a joystick...,"Visually, the game is very well done and the concepts behind it are intriguing. The biggest problem is the cumbersome keyboard controls that had me begging for the game to be joystick compatible. It's a fun game and there are parts that will have you excited, but overall it could have been a much better experience with better controls."
1,Great idea VERY POOR execution.,"I had waited for this game after playing the demo and what a big letdown. First of all you cant really play the game longer than 30 to 45 minutes because it slows down to such a crawl that it takes you 10 seconds to perform a action.Its not my system,running a 1 GIG HP,128 mb memory and Nividia card,besides everthing else runs fine.Also the game has so many bugs that sometimes you have come so close to completing a mission and it crashs for no apparent reason,there is no save game feature so you end up repeating so much over and over.There are so many other ANNOYING bugs that i just dont have time to go onto. Check out the Eidos site and you will see that i am not the only one with these problems and the game is incomplete,one mission is to run from one end of the jungle to the other,and was rushed out for Christmas. A suggestion for Eidos change the name to CRASHMAN CODENAME 500 BUGS"
3,I LOVE IT BUT I HATE IT,"Short and simple the game is awsome but, the bugs in this game are plenty. even the patch does nothing for it .I dont know if the developers were rushed to put this game out to the market but they (messed) this one up if it didnt have the freez ups and aggrivating slow loading i wouldnt have taken this game back to get max payne!!!!!!"
2,Great Fun,"Hitman is a fun game packed with a ton of weapons, baddies and confusing missions. It starts you off in a facilty were you begin training with the arsenal of weapons provided for you. A year later the party begins.The pros for me were the graphics and the large selection of guns and knives. The option of wearing the baddies outfit was a pretty great feature too.Cons, the way the missions were to be carried out was stupid. Story line was flat and the several bugs in the game got annoying. Another was repeating the same mission over and over from start because there is no save feature. And one that always got me was how certain missions left you stranded.All in all it was an okay game that found its spot on the shelf along with many of the other games i have. This is a probably the only game I lost interest in after the first day."
2,"Sad... so, so sad","The idea that you are a hitman who is hired to kill VIP's is really cool. Unfortunately for us, this game doesn't deliver that. You read the back of the box and visit the web site and you start to think that this is going to be an awesome game. Then you go to your local software store, buy the game, come home and install it and commense to play the game. Within the first 5 minutes of playing, you realize that you just wasted a good 50 or so dollars. The gameplay is smooth.... at times. The majority of the time it's jumpy and skippy. The camera angles suck. The graphics are very well done, but that's about the only thing to commend this game for. Perhaps they should've re-thought the idea of making this game in a 3rd person view. All-in-all, this game doesn't live up to the back of it's box. Don't waste your money!!!"
1,Unplayable,"Maybe I'm a moron, though. I loved Dues Ex by Eidos, as well as other FPS like Undying and Alice. After about the 20th time getting thrown back in the start room on the first level, despite following the cheat guide step by step (plus, no way to save mid-level), I've given up.If you find a way past the first training level, I hear the game is really clever. I'm not able to do it. Too bad, I really wanted this one to be cool.Shame on the developers. Most people would have told them what I have, if they'd listened."
3,Bugs and Thugs,"First problem: More bugs then a dirty house. No ingame save makes it an utter test of futility. I also had problems when using the scope on the rifle and the binoculars. No matter how I tried, I couldn't make the character drop it, so I was stuck with having to turn off the game and open it back up, hench starting at the same stage and figuring out how to complete the mission without the sniper rifle or binoculars. Second problem: Some of the missions lead to confusion, no matter what you try, nothing seems to work (as in the second mission at the resturant.). But all in all, it was a good game, if you like figure out ways to kill people with piano wires, knives and guns without being arrested. Wait until the price goes down, then you won't feel as bad when you give up in frustration and throw it in the pile of other games that you haven't finished yet."
3,"Fun, and descent graphics for an old game.","A great vintage game, and it works with Windows Vista which is rare for a game more than two years old."
4,Ruthie Foster,"Ruthie Foster is a very good blues singer. Crossover is actually the second CD she recorded and was orginally meant as a demo. It is a little rough in places but, overall, quite pleasant to listen to. Her later CDs are a bit more polished."
1,Absolute POS,This product has fallen apart after less than 2 months of use by a 75-year-old woman doing rehab exercises in bed. The straps are fraying and the seam that holds the buckle on one weight unraveled and that weight can no longer be fastened to the ankle.
3,ankle weights,I find them unwieldy but usable.Their floppinessmakes them hard to wrap and strap. you mustwear socks or they chafe the skin.
4,Simple to use.,"This tool is for the recreational hobbyist. It adds more to the versatile tool. Make of 99% plastic. Considering the price, quality and use its a great buy."
3,Lacking,"There things that could of been added to this to make it more versatile. Okay for what you buy , plastic."
2,"Marginal design, difficult to make fine adjustments","I got this as a cheap alternative to the Stew-Mac design...and it was a mistake. It is virtually impossible to make fine adjustments to depth, the base racks and one post will stick (as one other review pointed out) when you overcome that sticking post you get big sudden changes - very frustrating. I gave it a 2 because it might be fine for some activities, but it's very, very difficult to use for inlays or bindings."
3,OK for the price I paid,"I managed to pick it up on a closeout at Sears for $10. I'm glad that I didn't pay full price. I figure that, for $10, it will suit me as I learn how to do some small-scale, inlay-type work on musical instruments. Ultimately, when I can justify it, I will move up to the $53 Stew-Mac base, but for now I'll make this thing work. The plastic fitting for the router is a little wobbly, but then again, the Dremel 200 I just picked up used has plastic threads. A Dremel 4000 with the Stew-Mac base might be my ultimate goal."
2,Flimsy construction is inadequate,"Dremel router bits are small, for fine, delicate work. However, because of the plastic construction and one-sided locking of this tool, it lacks the accuracy required. Getting a precise depth setting is difficult, and the tool does not stay square to the work surface. With caution, it will do the job, but not as well as I would expect."
2,Flimsy,"Don't waste your money. If you can actually get it set and locked in the right position, you could probably get it to do what you need it to. But the plastic is very flimsy and I feel like I'm going to break it every time I tighten the handle. The Dremel barely has enough power to do any kind of significant routing. The edger barely provides the stability to run straight-edge routing."
3,probably useful,It is a good tool but not great. It is probably a good value when I consider the price paid but if great precision and smooth operation are essential you will need to spend more.
4,bought for hubby,I bought this for my husband and he uses it all the time great buy for some one who likes to work with designs and tools.
5,Love it!!!,I bought this for some light work on halloween projects and after using it i absolutly love it. Its built well and it works good. Just like a regular plunge router but on a smaller scale for dremel tool. I think its a must have
3,"Nice idea, doesn't really work","This attachment sounded perfect for the model making and dolls' house building I want to do. Thought I'd be able to do some nice box joints with an appropriate jig. Some problems - (1) you can't use standard screw in guide bushings, (2) even if you could get the bit centered on the base, it moves when you cut, so you get wiggly cuts, even with the edge guide (this is presumably why they don't give you guide bushings with any kind of tolerance).Save you money towards a real router."
2,A desirable capability,"Making a plunge cut is chancy without a base of this nature. A Dremel tool is a petite router great for delecate operations. The base on this attachment is as large as one used in 1/4hp routers, negating an asset.The attachment points of the router to the base are close together near the bottom end of the router. It is easy to wiggle the tool even when screws are firmly tightened.This is a useful concept; it can do what it is supposed to do, but is less than ideal."
1,Dremel Plunge Router Base Poor Design,"Do not waste your money on this poorly made plunge router base. I found that the cheap plastic construction allowed the Dremel to wobble thus making accurate cuts, especially straight lines very dificult. When lowering the Dremel using the plunge feature, one side or the other will stick and cause the whole assembly to bind. I threw this base in the trash and bought Stewmac's metal router base that has an air blower accessary which is a great system. You can make clear plastic special purpose bases and attach them easily to the Stewmac. I build guitars so accuracy is important."
2,too big,"What is the point of an almost full size base for a mini router? i assumed it would be like the old one i had, small for inlaying fingerboards.... does not fit cordless."
4,Running out of jobs?,"Mike rowe is always funny and entertaining, but this season seems like they were runnining out of material it's not as entertaining as the previous seasons. They also seem to be getting more nasty than dirty, they have way more sexual, and body fluid content in season 7. Also uin previose seasons they showed the best stuff from 2 or more jobs in each episode, but in season 7 they show 1 job and it seems more drawn out and even boring at times. Here's hoping season 8 gets back on track if there is a season 8."
3,First track.,I agree with previous writer. The first track is a killer.(dub version of Love fire) Its one of my all time favorite tracks ever. The rest of the album is ok...but nothing special.
5,A seven.,"Masterfully written. If it were possible to rate this book as 6 stars, I would rate it 7. Not only are you enjoying this vividly written novel, but you are also learning in a great way some of the history of our country at a time when racial tensions in some parts of the country were spreading and rising in the North. Simply put, if you want to learn and don't mind wanting to stay up late at night just so you can see what happens next, buy this book. Bravo Professor Boyle. Highly recommended."
4,Arc of Justice,"A well written tale of a signal event in detroit area race relations,of special interest to me,as I haved lived there most of my life.I enjoyed reading it,but would have preferred a little less detail,as the story became a bit tedious after a while.Altogether a worthwhile read."
4,racism and justice in the 1920s,"I highly recommend this story of a high profile trial of a group of African-Americans in Jazz Age era Detroit. The trial came at a time when racism and xenophobia were reaching a high pitch in America, producing the rise of restrictive covenants designed to keep ""undesirables"" out of white, Protestant neighborhoods. The trial involved murder charges against an African American doctor and his family and friends who tried to protect his home against an angry mob of white neighbors, one of whom died during the confrontation. Clarence Darrow was one of the defense lawyers; and the NAACP, then in its infancy, was active in orchestrating the defense in the media, as well as in the courtroom. The book gives a good feel for this period in history and a nuanced, non-judgemental view of the spinning and politicking that occurred on both sides of the case. Boyle also paints a compelling, human picture of the defendants, most of them children or grandchildren of slaves."
2,Story Lost in Details,"After a friend recommended this book, I started it with an open mind, intending to learn about what happened to the Sweets and others in the early 1900's. While the story did cover that, I was overwhelmed with the detail that took me away from the main story. When a new person was introduced, the book would be derailed by telling a back story in extreme detail, going back many generations. I couldn't keep the people straight and found myself frustrated that so much detail was provided about others when what I really wanted to know - what happened in 1925 when the Sweets moved to a white neighborhood - kept getting pushed back and lost.I finally quit half way through the book and googled the story so I could read what really happened."
4,compelling and tragic history,"compelling and tragic history of racism in America which leaves one astonished at the level of vitriol and brutality aimed at black Americans over many decades - and all of this is AFTER the years of slavery. In terms of the story of Ossian Sweet, a bit of a concern was the length of time taken to get through the story plus the repeated hypothetical descriptions of what Sweet may or may not have felt. Highlight is the trip through time beginning with Reconstruction through the 1920s to highlight just how brutal American society was for so many years. Hardly a ringing endorsement for the so called 'greatest country in the world' and a reminder of how America may best be described as a work in progress and which may also be described as a country far removed from the modern world."
5,Why hasn't this been made into a movie?,"I had to read this book for a class, and unlike other historical works, this one reads like a novel. The background story of Ossian Sweet is so moving that I could picture prominent African-American actors portraying his character and winning Academy Awards. That a director has not made this story into a movie is a shame. I teach American history and I had never heard of this case before, and with leading characters like Clarence Darrow, I found that surprising. This book is well worth reading--it won't disappoint!"
1,A nuisance,"I thought this would be the easiest and most flexible way to have the lights come on when we walk into our garage. Wrong!The first set we received had a defective sensor, so we exchanged it. The second one seemed to be working, so we optimized the location and installed it. One day later, one of the bulbs is burning constantly instead of timing out. You would think that turning the light switch on and off would resolve this, but no. You have to fiddle with the bulbs and sensor to get everything working again. And the instruction booklet is for every sensor Heath Zenith makes and quite cryptic. I'm going to keep tweaking this, but what a hassle!"
4,entertaining movie from 1990,"""Diving In"" is from 1990.It Stars Matt Adler and Kristy Swanson.i highly enjoyed this movie..it used to be on cable alot!Adler is a good actor and so is Swanson.i used to take swimming classes and often had to jump off the diving board!i can relate to this movie.swimming scenes are great and the acting is good too.if u get a chance..rent or buy this movie..i just put it in my shopping cart!"
3,Take The Plunge!,"This is a nice little film. The acting, sounds and the beautiful color of the scenes really are wonderful. I can really feel for the kid who is afraid of diving as the movie will actually put you in his place up there on the diving board. I not only enjoyed watching this movie but i was in it. I played the sports announcer at the swimming meet and also the guy driving a car through the chicken drive up. I must say this film is very entertaining with a very talented cast. If you get a chance to rent or buy this film,take the plunge and do so. You will not be disappointed."
2,Cheap Packaging,"Just a note about the very cheap packaging of this product. The cover art is so blurry it is almost unreadable as if it were printed at fast draft on a very cheap printer. Amazon sent me another copy, but it was exactly the same and so it was returned. The disc itself was professionally done, but MGM could sure take a lesson on the cover art printing from the Warners and Universal Studies vault collection DVDs."
3,"Enjoyable, but not great","I doubt that any film can do justice to Mary McCarthy's spicy turns of phrases or her brilliant social insights. Given this parameter The Group is an enjoyable film. It is a little prudish when compared to the novel, but I imagine that it was bold for its period."
3,The Group,"Very mediocre quality. ""Made from best available sources"" doesn't excuse the poor audio, which suffers from periodic compression and unmonitored levels, occasional hum and whining which disappears as different camera angles are intercut, overmodulation and distortion in the funeral parlor scene, and a front cover that looks like a 20th generation photocopy of the original theater poster. The quality is that of an early 80s VHS. At least it's not pan and scan. If this is the kind of quality I can expect from these ""to order"" releases, I won't be buying any more. Too bad."
4,Practical But pre-requiring UML,This book is practical and explains UML usage based on design process. I think it is useful for someone who has UML knowledge and want to know practical applicatin of UML in real field. But this book doens not explain UML itself.
5,This is a Good Book,"It may not have all the coins in the world, but darn near all of them. I've looked up about 300 of them and they were all there. It gives a little history of each country. It has a front section with some tables and charts to help you figure out what language is on your mystery coin. It's about the size of a big phone book and the pages are thin, just like a phone book. They have to be, otherwize the book would be huge. I don't know if the values for the various coins are exactly right, but who cares?"
5,Excellent !!,"My 20 month old son loves this book. He keeps coming back to it time after time after time. This one and Peek-A-Moo, also by Bernard Most, are excellent choices"
5,rien a dire,ce produit est bien arrive dans les temps lemballage etait correct c'est tout ce que j'ai a en dire merci
1,Bad,"This map is another bad map of the island. I bought several before I spent the summer there, and I threw this one away. It must be over 10 years old. I bought one from a local gas station on the island which was cheaper, and much, much better."
2,"Outdated, Outdated, Outdated",This map has just not kept up with the times! There are errors throughout - you just can't trust it. The only map really sold on the island is from Metrodata and its updated every year. I wouldn't trust any other road maps of Puerto Rico.
4,A Keeper!,"An envelope full of devastating pictures, a software company gone bad, and the sailboat that will fix it all. Bette Nordberg has written another memorable story that will leave its mark on your heart.With its hopeful message of trust, and the power of forgiveness, not to mention the added spice of mystery,'Pacific Hope' is definitely a keeper!"

2,interesting,"bought for a class in my master's program. very wordy, but informative. just a little too boring to really enjoy."
3,"the book is alright, but very basic","The book is good to start with.Pros: has links to some resources, easy to readCons: very basic, doesn't give too much information"
5,Excellent resource,There aren't many references out there pertaining to the navajo language. Having a picture dictionary makes learning the words easier and more enjoyable. Yes it does look outdated due to the fact it was published in the late 80's but it is very thorough and makes memorization easier when you connect the word with the visual.
1,Not a reliable surveyof Greene,"This ""biography"" spends much time summarizing the plot of nearly every work of fiction written by Greene [and I must admit, Shelden does a remarkable job at *this* task], but loses nearly all credibility when every story is ""traced"" back to possible real-life situations. For example, *The Third Man* is Greene's coverage of his knowledge of the Hitler assasination attempt [courtesy of his time with the British Secret Service], as was reported to him to British defector Kim Philby(yes, *that* Kim Philby). Now, before you say, ""well, could happen"", I say yes, except: bear in mind that Shelden's sources are *not* private letters and journals by Greene, but newspaper reviews and readily-available texts of Greene's interviews - which, as anyone who studies Greene in any capacity, is scarely enough to delve into this novelist's highly-precocious mind. Look at the sources at the end of the book.... NO exposure of the private Greene at all.Stickto Shelly."
1,An Utterly Repulsive Piece of Trash,"The only reason I gave this repulsive book one star is that there was no way to register zero stars! This is an ugly, ugly book, and I had to shower after reading a few chapters. I never finished it."
2,A warm glass of milk on a hot summer day,"I can't say I was overly impressed with this CD. Gilbert and Sullivan's ""Pirates of Penzance"" is one of my favorite operettas, but I hardly recognized the selections on this disc. It seemed to be arranged as a serious, classical opera rather than a happy, G&S-type operetta. While technically correct, the selections seemed to lack a spirit of ""joie de vivre"" as though the company was tired after lunch. The gentleman who sang ""I am the very model of a modern major general"" sounded like he was up for retirement and was hard put to keep up with the music. The sound also was not of the greatest quality --it seemed to be recorded on the stage with distant mikes, rather than in a studio as it should have been. I have to say I was somewhat disappointed in this selection, but then, the price was cheap."
4,nice,"its not bad at all. just like soap for your gentle area. you can hardly smell the rose scent though. i wish it gave a more ""clean"" feeling afterwards too."
5,Good History of Little Orphan Annie!,"This book is an outstanding collection of the cartoons thatmade Little Orphan Annie a comic legend.This book gives you agood history of the life and times of Little Orphan Annie.Youare able to meet Daddy Warbucks,Punjab,Sandy and the other characters who made up the life of Little Orphan Annie.If youare a fan of collector comics this is the book for you."
5,Opinioni,"For me, this recording was a true gift. Through the intensity of Cecilia's voice and tone, I was given a furtheur glimpse towards the tremendous beauty created through the mastery of the great baroque composers on this disc.Through this period arose the most sublime of arie for the voice, as it was the period when vocal techniqe found its most lofty of achievements, and the highest degree of skill imaginable, creating the study of the voice as a true art, and giving us the gift of the greatest singers to have truly soared in that art, the great Italian castrati. Although we have yet to rediscover such technique and skill, and beauty created through the perfected voice, Ms.Cecilia Bartoli brought us furthur to great vocalization, and that most sublime of accomplishments, and source, of true pleasure. To Cecilia, and the great composers of this recording: Bravissimi!!"
5,Should be on the Essentials list!,"This is one of my favorite CDs. Her choice of rep, her interpretation, her vocal quality-all are top-notch! This CD is the best introduction to 18th cent. song you'll ever find. Just beautiful. (And singers: try singing along with her. This is a good rehearsal recording as well, coupled with the G. Schirmer 17&18th Century Song book.)"
5,My first Cecilia Bartoli album....,"If you owned only one of Cecilia Bartoli's albums, before her wondrous Vivaldi and Gluck releases, IF YOU LOVE ME, would be it.Not only is her voice extraordinarily flexible in a technical sense, but her capacity to convey the emotions found in the lyrics is unmatched today, at least to my ears.The most beautiful songs on this recording are:Son Tutto Duolo, Caro Mio Ben, Selve Amiche, and Sposa Son Disprezzata. The entire album is great and Gyorgi Fischer is a wonderful match on the piano to Ms. Bartoli's talents. There's so much melancholy in these songs, but how welcome it is when Cecilia's sings of it!!Bravissima!!!"
4,Songs not just for students,"The ""24 Arias"" are known by every singer as the beginner songs, and the fact is that many students butcher the songs because they find them very boring to sing. Therefore this is a recording for any beginner. Cecilia's coloring, vocal line, diction and basic interpretation are what an aspiring singer should aim for. Even the ""boring"" songs are brought to life by this versitile singer. How many times has one heard ""Se tu m'ami"" and just thought, ""Not again."" Well Cecilia brings new life to timeless songs and hopefully she will inspire younger singers to find the beauty in these songs. For the non-singers, what more could you want to hear but a beautiful singer singing beautiful songs?"
4,"Great Selection of Opera Pieces, and Well Performed","Cecilia Bartoli is nothing short of amazing. Her voice is very well exercised being able to have a wide range and ton color for each individual piece. This CD includes over an hour, (approximately 66 minutes) of music with a total of 21 songs. I found each one breathtaking and inspiring. Her voice is accompanied only by piano, which is also well done. It probably would have been better if an orchestra accompanied some of the songs to add distinction. That way they all would not have seemed as similar as they sometimes did.She had wonderful control over her voice while holding notes for a long time, or hitting higher notes. I am just amazed by her experience. Overall this CD is simply a good listen. If you like opera, than you much check out Cecilia Bartoli's singing!"
1,waste of money,"This is one of the wosrt books I have seen for soap making! It did not explain what she was doing, and it didn't give any info on where to get many of the required materials (such as molds). I've been a soaper for many years and I didn't always understand what she was trying to say. If there was a lower rating than 1 star I would give it to this book."
5,A Great City Captured,"This week someone forwarded to me some pics of the Detroit decline: beautiful theaters turning to dust, houses falling in... What Rogovin has captured here is the vibrancy of an area (Buffalo's south side) that once had thousands of manufacturing jobs. He's focussed on the people holding those jobs, along with their families. Last time I visited, these factories were dust. I'll be looking for a similar photographic essay of Detroit!"
4,A generous selection!,"With so much of the recording offered as highlights it would have been better to purchase the full operetta. This recording dates from 1960 and is superalative in every respect. John Reed, Jean Hindmarsh, Thomas Round together with the late Donald Adams are reasons enough to acquire this version. The only missing quality is the dialogue. Never was the libretti of Gilbert ever spoken with more relish for the language and with such finesse. If you decide upon further investigation I urge you to do so."
4,Great,I really like the slots for shells. It is a reat sling that is easy to install and is very comfortable.
4,A Wild Ride!,"Forget mere defenses of the Shroud! This book is an audacious attempt to connect almost every feature on the cloth to an authenticating image.The book is aptly titled - it reads as an adventure. The continuing ""discoveries"" pile up as the book proceeds. At times, it is a little too easy to get caught up in the story.I have to admit that the grandious ""Polarized Image Overlay Technique"" is neat, but slightly overemphasized. Still, its application is central to the Whanger's research.The relation of the Shroud to the Mandylion is particularly interesting, as are the discussion of the flaws in the carbon dating techniques and the discussion of the dimensionality of the image.Overall, an excellent starting point for a serious investigation of the Shroud."
5,Great book for new parents,"I used this book for a psych class I had (not with one of the authors, but with one of their colleagues at the same university; had one of the authors for my general psych class though :). It is a great resource for new parents because it tells you what's going on throughout your child's development and things you can do to help stimulate them at various stages along the way."
1,DVD Playing Packed in,"after only a few weeks. All DVDs would skip or just get stuck. CDs still played well and the sound is good to my ear. The speakers are heavy and look well made, but I'm not an expert on this stuff.I won't buy a Phillips again."
2,Philips Tube DVD Stereo,"A little disappointed with the tube quality sound. Also after a CD is played the unit powers off. There is some unatural sounds when the CD is loaded. You have to reject the disc and reinsert.I think this unit has a great market of potential buyers, but I believe the unit is premature in its release. If I had to do it all over, I would not purchase this unit"
2,Not so great.,"I hoped this would be a book of proverbs or ideas that were uniquely Italian. My idea was to share my heritage with my grandchildren. It is just a compilation of quotes from well known people who happen to be Italian, but anyone could have said these things."
4,Review From a Future Critic,"This book is the best by far of the four latest books in the ""Justice League"" series because it is neither about magic or uses an old idea. I must admit they could've found a better way to cure the Flash though, but basically it's a good book, so you should get it, but if you can only get one, I recommend you get ""Justice League- Wild at Heart""."
5,Battle of Kanna Village,"I have only seen the first two episodes of this disc and it was subtitled. Well including the first 3 english DVD's. This one gives you exactly what you would expect, the bandits attack Kanna Village with impressive numbers, but the samurai and villagers repell the attack in the first episode. In the second the Samurai lay a trap and let them selves be captured. All and all theres alot of action, story line flows pretty well and the chars are likeable. Katshiro the inexperienced of the samurai becomes much more then a sniveling wanna be and shows what he can really do as well in the second episode. If your in to the series dont stop its definitly worth it for this disc. I hope this review helped."
1,Not Effective,"After using the product for three months, I can safely say that it has minimal to no effect on my BPH issues. I'm going to be switching to an Ayurvedic remedy that has over ten clinical studies proving its efficacy. I couldn't find any studies on the LEF product, and although the ingredients theoretically should provide relief, the formula just does not work for me."
5,Much easier than searching for them in a store,"This is a great way to purchase vacuum bags. I used to have to listen to a hard-sell vacuum salesperson trying to upgrade my vacuum, now I can just click and save time."
4,Exquisitely executed,"This CD contains exquisitely executed, lushly rendered brass and wind sections, however, the vocal work is staged in an apparently large orchestral/concert hall setting (if you like that sort of thing)."
5,Wusthof is the best,"Be ready for this to be a heavy tool. I bought another 6"" cleaver for my 4'9"", 80 pound wife because this one was too heavy for her to handle for regular use--it will cut a chicken back in two in one stroke! I use whetstones to put an edge on cutting tools and with this quality of steel, surgical sharpness is a reality. The thing about Wusthof quality is you are not just buying a knife or cleaver for one life-time. This one is going to the Philippines, where butchering at ""home"" is still a reality--and this cleaver will be handed down for generations to come. The only cutting blade steel products to ever buy are made in either Germany or Sheffield England. Chinese made knives make a really cool sound as they bounce off of the trash can."
3,Thermometer,"The background picture prevents easy viewing the temperatures from a distance, but I chose it because of the picture. So It's OK."
4,Just Buy It,"After seeing Grady at the Newport Beach Jazz Festival, I went right out and bought this CD. I has been in hte CD player in my truck all week. Grady delivers a funky yet smooth sound much like David Sanborn. If he continues to team with major talent like Jeff Lorber for his productions, this man will really go places. Everyone who has ridden with me this week has purchased this CD."
5,Outstanding Jeff Lorber Production!,"The publicist of Grady Nichols sent me a copy of his new CD. The Oklahoma native is a rising star in the jazz world. He was discovered by legendary jazz artist Jeff Lorber and he has produced his third release, ""Sophistication"". Lorber takes his style of smooth jazz and brings Nichols to the level of respect. His CD has a bunch of well known artists to help him out in addition to Lorber such as Chris Botti & Bill Gable. As for Nichols, his sound is crisp, clear and bright. I especially enjoyed the tracks, ""Tuesday Morning"", ""Speak"" and ""Quiet Times"". This is one CD that will get lots of playing time on well established Smooth Jazz radio. It's a great CD that will get second looks and listens!"
5,Smooth-As-Silk,This is a great compilation by Grady Nichols. It is rare to get a CD with more than 2 or 3 selections that are memorable and keep you coming back for more. This entire CD is enjoyable and still fresh. The collaboration with other top performers helps to highlight the quality of the recording. I highly recommended it.
3,Do The Job But Painful,"These ankle weights work very well; the construction is good and they hold up nicely. Being able to work your way up one pound at a time is great. But they are truly painful. I'm a small woman with small ankles, but that shouldn't matter. Regardless of how big your ankles are, the weights just gouge into the bones as you walk. I've doubled over wash cloths and pinned them around my ankles, and they still kill me. I have permanent bruises at my ankle bones. The manufacturer really needs to attach some kind of heavy-duty padding to the back to prevent this from happening. I wear them, but I don't think I'd buy them again."
3,Very heavy,"I bought these to put weight on a baby stroller so that my infant who was starting to walk and wanted to push her stroller wouldn't fall. It did the job, but I think it would've been better with 5 lb weights. These are very heavy. You can take out some of the weight which is good, but with all of them in, it's very heavy."
2,Meh,My new (older) kitten was not impressed. Maybe he doesn't like cat nip? He'll play with almost anything - even tissues - but does not play with this.
3,Awesome but not for rough players,"I absolutely adore this toy. The catnip is potent, my cats loved it, and it's just plain adorable. The only problem is that my cat who has claimed it as his is a MAJORLY rough player. Within a few hours of arrival, he had chewed into one of the ends, making it a bit gross with a catnip/cat saliva mix. The toy is still usable for now, but if I let him play with it for too long, he starts gnawing at the end and it will soon break completely open.I recommend this toy if your cat is less of a maniac than mine is!"
3,It's ok,"Based on the raving reviews, I thought i'd give this toy a try. I'll start by saying that my cat seems to be choosier than most, & very particular about what she engages/interacts with. The banana is soooo cute, sewn well, and filled w/organic cat nip. The cat nip (maybe because it's organic, I don't know) sent my cat into a sneezing frenzy & was extremely strong smelling. I laughed just watching her sneeze so much while trying to play with it. After batting it around & rubbing her face/body on it for about 5 minutes, she was done...pretty much for good. She LOVES the Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Cat Toy, however, and never tires of playing with it. Overall, I guess it depends on the cat. Some seem to love it , others don't. Mine didn't."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this for my kitty who plays with just about everything. I gave him the toy and tried to encourage him to play with it. He smelled it pushed it around for a second and has not looked at it since. I don't think the shape of it is a good shape for a cat. Maybe my kitty did'nt like the smell of the catnip inside of the toy, although he enjoys other toys with catnip. I would not recommend this toy to anyone."
5,Cats and Ferrets Love it!,"I normally make my own catnip toys with home grown catnip but saw such great reviews I decided to try yeoww. The absolutely loved it and still love it. I often find it soaking wet in saliva (gross, but evidence of a cat's use). Also my ferrets love to grab it and hide it away, they seem to be attracted the catnip sccent as well. I will continue to buy Yeoww!"
1,Cat didn't take to it,Our cat likes catnip toys such as these but hated this one. The cat just doesn't care for this toy or even the catnip in it.
3,my cat doesn't respond to catnip,"This was a cute toy. I adopted my cat in June, so I've been learning what she likes / doesn't like. Catnip seems to do nothing for her. She isn't attracted to it in any form. When I gave her the banana, she wouldn't play with it and wasn't enticed by the catnip within. I think it's probably a cool toy for cats that like catnip, so I'll give it an OK rating."
5,simply MARVELOUS!!!,"i have 3 cats- one is very picky. they all went crazy over this banana. they drooled all over it, like they were on drugs. they all just love, love , loved it. money well spent."
3,Kitten doesnt like it,"I purchased this and the rainbow toy from Yeoww and my 6 month old kitten does not want to go by them at all, he is very playful, and if i try to play with him with this he will just walk away, he doesn't even want to go near it. I'm not exactly sure why, it seems like it has very strong catnip, so it might just be that he doesn't like the catnip. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does seem sturdy and I've had it for about 3 months now, and it still smells like catnip. I think some cats might just love the strong catnip smell, my cat just doesn'tupdate: The other day I actually saw him finally playing with them! i think the smell might have faded enough for him to like it, or maybe he isn't as picky any more"
5,Perfect Toy,The banana was a big hit with both of my cats.After licking it at length it gets thrown around the room or secreted in a box.Gave them as gifts this year and were very much appreciated by the cats and their owners.
2,Maybe she's too young,My kitten is pretty young (maybe 3-4 months?) and she doesn't really seem to care about this banana. I searched a little after seeing no reaction and she might just be too young to care or she might not have the gene that makes her like it. The price was alright though and I got it pretty much the day after I ordered it so that is good.
5,Great For Cats That Easily Lose Toys,"My cat can lose a catnip mouse under a piece of furniture in about 20 minutes. I read reviews about this product and decided its size would help prevent that from happening, but I was a bit skeptical of how fond of a banana my cat could be. I got this as a Christmas present for my cat last year.It's been three months, but she still uses it and hasn't lost it. I'm impressed at how well the catnip inside has maintained its effectiveness. All I have to do is give it a little shake to move the catnip inside around and the cat is ready to play. The shape is really good for the cat to lie on its side and hold between its paws. It's also very amusing to watch the cat play with a banana. Although it is a bit pricey, I ultimately recommend this toy for your pet."
4,Can't please 'em all,"Well, Tucker, who'll be 20 in March, has gotten a new lease on life with this. He loves it, chews it and sleeps with it. My two girls turned their noses up at it, but since there are some cats who don't go for catnip, I guess that's the case with them."
3,"Great catnip, but not sturdy enough for my cat","My cat went absolutely nuts for this banana, I gave it to him for Christmas. As soon as he caught a whiff of it in the stocking he couldn't wait to get at it. Unfortunately, he liked it so much that he had ripped it to shreds within minutes. After the catnip started spilling everywhere I had to take it away and clean up the mess. I agree with others about the catnip, this is the strongest smelling catnip I've ever seen, I just wish it had been a bit sturdier. So far, I have yet to find a catnip toy that can withstand my cat's ferocious biting and chewing."
1,Maybe good for kittens? Destroyed in under 60 seconds.,"Bought this based on all the positive reviews. I have two adult cats, and gave one of them this. And the other the lemon (See other review).Both items had holes with leaking catnip in under 1 minute. This was from them just chewing on them. I'd hear a popping noise as their teeth would puncture it. Within a few minutes the banana was coming apart from the seems and now has a big hole in it.Pretty much needs to go in the trash now unless I decide to try and sew it back together.Maybe good for kittens, but adult cats forget it. The catnip must be good though, they sure ravaged this to get inside of it."
3,Not durable enough to stand up to cat play!,"My cats love these things! I bought the set of three. Glad I did because they keep coming apart at the seams and I have to keep trying to stitch them closed. I have other stuffed catnip toys that are over a decade old and have seen some rough play days but still haven't come apart like these have. Great fun for cats, but quality could be improved."
3,"Loved it, at first","Cats go wild for these when they are first opened. However, the catnip scent seems to wear off quickly, and the pretty yellow banana turns brown within a couple days. My kitten played with them some. My daughter's older cat went crazy for them and still liked carrying them around after the scent wore down. So, works for some and not for others."
5,Best toy my cat has ever had,"I've ordered about three of these because my cat LOVES this catnip toy. I'm not sure if it's because of the size (perfect to grab, swat around, etc), or the color, but my cat is obsessed. Best catnip toy I've ever bought."
5,purfect,"Bought 3 catnip toys from this company. All were as described, and totally filled with nip, not stuffing with a bit of nip like most companies. THIS is the place to get your nip from!!!"
1,Disposable cat toy,Unfortunately this toy didn't see a full minute of use before catnip started leaking out of tooth puncture holes. Save your money.
2,Cat not interested,"Now, my cat LOVES catnip. He goes NUTS over it. So naturally after reading the reviews, I thought this toy would be a huge hit. He completely ignores it. If I try to entice him with it, he gets irritated and walks away: this is not normal for him, he is usually very playful with anything you put near his face. I am not sure why this toy doesn't do anything for my cat, but it just isn't for him."
4,Crazy...at first,"My cat flipped out for the first few days having this. She even drooled all over the box it came in. After those initial few days she could care less for it. I'm not sure if it's just her being a cat, or that catnip has worn off."
2,Poor Build Quality,"Purchased the yellow banana for our two cats and experienced the same issue that others have reported, the banana burst at the seam within an hour of them playing with it. I noticed in one Amazon review that the Yeowww company did admitted there was a flaw with the stitching on a batch of the bananas. I decided to contact the company myself via their own site, but never received a response. The banana was a great design, but honestly I wouldn't purchase this product again. BTW....we also purchased the Yeowww tomato and lemon. The tomato experienced the same fate as the banana, the lemon seems to be holding up perfectly fine after 3 months of use."
5,Awesome Cat Toy,"My cat likes real bananas, so that's a bit odd, but she loves this toy too! One of the only things she's played with, most other times she ignores any other stuffed toys we get her.Recommended!"
1,Not for my cats,I have 4 cats and none of them were interested in this toy. Buying toys for cats is a hit or miss. This was a miss.
3,Not very durable,This would have been a wonderful toy for my 2 year old if only he hadn't ripped it wide open within the first 2 hours. But at least he enjoyed rolling around in the catnip piles all over the carpet for a bit :P seriously they need to be made with better quality materials.
2,Wow just wow.,"I bought this item a little bit ago. I tried cancelling my order and they shipped the order the next day. This was from AWORLDOFPUPS. I'm just saying bad service. Didn't try the item itself out yet, but the service."
4,Cats loved it,"My cats loved this toy. Bad thing is I only bought one and I have 5 cats so they were all gathered around it. My male cat slobbered on it so much it looked like it was an old toy when it was one day old. It got gross looking pretty fast. That's probably the only negative, and me knowing how long it will last now. Overall the cats loved it though."
1,lasted two days,"My cat loved the banana, licking it, rubbing it, and biting it. Two days later, she has ripped the seam open and there is catnip spilled all over the floor and a very empty banana ""peel"" lying uncared for."
2,Cats don't bother with it,", The box from amazon came and I put it on a table to open later. My female was on the table and ripping the box open, when I came home 2 hrs later. Excited, I figure I had a winner.I opened the box and took this out and another like it and gave them to each cat. After a few minutes, that was it. In 10 days, they haven't touched them again. I fluff them up and toss them across the floor, but after reaching them, both my cats just walk away.I think its too big, or the catnip is not to their taste. That's my story with them. On the positive, it is well constructed, that's the 2 stars."
2,Did not live up to expectations,"I bought this cause I have a new kitten and a 6 yr old cat and both are active and very playful. MOST of all I bought it because of the reviews. The reviews were over the moon, but I must have gotten an old one or a bad one because my kitties could care less about this Catnip Banana. They'd rather play with a rolled up piece of paper. I mean, they love catnip, so again, I am trying to be fair and say I must have gotten an old or bad one. Buyer beware is all I'm saying."
5,Best catnip ever!,"Yeowww! catnip is the only catnip that my cat responds to. It is super-potent, and the toys are adorable and durable. His catnip cigar is several years old and he will still chase after it and roll around on the floor with it. He just received the banana for his birthday and he loves it. . .last night it was tucked under his arm like a teddy bear. Yeowww! catnip may cost more $$ than you're used to spending on catnip, but it's worth every penny."
3,Catnip Banana,"My four cats are finicky. Three out of the four went crazy soon as I put the banana on the floor, and the 4th never paid any attention. But, sadly, they soon lost interest, and it's been in the same spot since I unpacked it. I was hoping this would be the best catnip toy ever, but I think my cats just aren't interested in getting ""high"" that much. The only thing that really seems to work is the loose catnip that I can sprinkle around. They like to eat it."
3,no bananas,My 10 year old 24 lb. tom cat played with this about 30 minutes.Now he walks by it and doesn't even sniff at it.Then again he is not very play full.I would recommend the Sojos Catnip it's cheap and he goes a little Bananas over it.
4,Short and good course,"I enjoyed doing the course. The author claims that you will be able to use Romanian as used in daily life. This true for the most but do not expect to be able to translate poems or read specialist articles. Depending on your language background you have to learn a lot more words. This can not be expected from a short course. I am however able to go around in Romania, do my shopping, make myself clear in conversations and not feel totally helpless. This book does not waist time on useless practices. In fact every excercise is usefull and should be taken. It also serves as a very good reference guide on Romanian language after completion of the course. The accompanying tapes have been a great help."
2,Not her best work,"I had great hopes for this recording given the other review here and my great fondness for Mirella Freni. But this is not her best work by a long shot. She sings with great effort, her tone is uneven and hollow and the high notes are shrill and screechy. She shouldn't have attempted this project so late in her glorious career. This recording is hard to listen to and I'm a big fan."
3,"Fine as a whole, but few stand out.","If I'm not mistaken, o previous reviewer, this is a compilation album and indeed no ""band"" at all. The tracks by Pendulum are my favorites, and refreshing bits of organic sounds are mixed in to create something often more akin to ambient than D&B or acid jazz. It is a good compilation, and its unheard doom is a true shame."
1,poor quality,It was not worth my time to return this item and donated it instead. The quality was poor and where it was made should be ashamed of there work.
2,'China Beach' comes to Afghanistan,"Wanted to like this show about multinational Doctors working in a 'MASH' type hospital in the war zone of Afghanistan; but didn't. The premise has tons of potential and the Actors are all fine, but it just didn't 'grab me' and I'm a fan of most medical shows (House, Nurse Jackie). Sometimes its easy to think the networks are 'idiots' cause they cancel shows after 1 season that are really, really good and I love finding 'gems' like that on Amazon for purchase. And sometimes, they cancel a show like this--and I can see why. Its not horrible, its just not that compelling to spend time watching in my view and somebody else might love it!"
4,The Annotated and Illistrated Journals of Robert Rogers excellent,I am in the process of annotating and illustrating a book about an ancestor who was killed during the Revolutionary War. Since he was killed by troops under the command of Major Thomas Posey of Morgan's Rangers there are approximately 20 pages of affidavits in George Washington's Papers in the Library of Congress about this incident. The Robert Rogers Journals are helpful to me in organizing my book.
5,AMAZING!,"I love Stephen Speaks. They are such an amazing group, well worth taking the time to listen to. Give them a try....you won't regret it :)"
3,"Old School, but Old","I saw this in the store and thought it was a new joint from GZA, but it's only an old album re-distributed.You definitely hear the Big Daddy Kane, New Jack Swing sound with this album, with the James Brown horns in the back ground. But it's 17 years too late.Gza is a far more polished MC than he was back then. He has his own voice now and his Lyrics are very tight.Ok, for the nostalgics, but I want some next level lyrics."
5,Good stuff,"I found several things to work into mt training time. Somethings I read in it never would have even occured to me. Just about anybody would be able to get at least one useful peice of information out of Mr. Justa's book, and that is what will make this a good buy for anybody wanting to increase real functional strength. Pumpers and Posers need not purchase."
5,Not for mainstream gym goers,"This is the book for those who want to get strong, primarily or for sports, and taking the spot on my shelf next to Tsatsouline's ""Power for the People"". Justa is a strongman, not a bodybuilders, and you won't find any info on improving the shape of your biceps, getting pecs bigger or getting ripped. For that reason, if you are a gym goer and like mirrors, belts, gloves and other attributes of fitness industry - don't buy it. The book is for those who like basic, down-to-earth strength training without hype.The principles in the book are very simple. So is the equipment required: no special machines, just barbell and awkward objects. Justa shares his ideas on training for various purposes, such as getting stronger only in one lift, for powerlifting or for overall strength using 30-40 lifts. The book is small but well worth the money."
2,Nearly useless,"I agree with the reviewer who said the routines require you to live in a junkyard. Unless you have 4,000 pounds of scrap metal and some railroad ties handy (and I'm not kidding), you'll be better served buying a solid, old school-lifting treatise like Brawn or even Super Squats.I sold my copy of this book on ebay."
2,Thoroughly dissapointing,"I purchased this book after reading the rave reviews. Frankly, what I found were a bunch of lifts that require the trainee to live in a junkyard or in the backwoods somewhere. The point of the book is that you should work on different lifts to develop different types of functional strength. This can be done with some creativity. I aggree with this advice, I just don't find it practical to perform the majority of the lifts described (at least for city dwellers). Instead of this book, I would highely recommend The New Power Program by Dr. Michael Colgan."
4,GOOD STUFF from a good ol' boy...,"Justa puts strength training in a brand new light with this book. It's refreshing to see someone shatter all of the ""proper procedures"" most trainers/fitness people preach on a regular basis. Manual labor is one of the most practical ways of aquiring FUNCTIONAL STRENGTH....and Justa helps put it all in perspective so that you can experience it for yourself..."
4,Lives Up To Its Title,This is an academic account of the title-designated subject matter with an eye towards its relevence to recent (then-the 70's) developments. Best and one of the few English accounts on this rather esoteric area of WW2 militaria.....useful also in a political sense to increased understanding of the region's dynamics...
1,Reader beware -,"Reader beware - This novel uses the names of real people, but places them in situations that never existed, doing things they never could have done, often with people they never knew. Do not expect to learn anything about the historical characters portrayed. This is fiction.Also, beware that this novel is not suitable for children, and implies that the characters were of low moral fiber. There is nothing in the historical record to corroborate this implication. Again, it is one author's fiction."
5,Outstanding Performances,The music on this CD is absolutely the best version of Rachmaninoff's works I have ever heard. A virtual rollercoaster of moods and emotions exactly as I think the master himself would want this music to be performed.
5,A must have for all Jefferson variety collectors,"This book goes through just about every doubled/tripled die variety in the Jefferson series. There are many closeups and explanations of what to look for. Also included is the standard section explaining the various types of doubling and how they occur. A greater book on explaining it is the Modern Minting Process book the ANA publishes. (available only from their web site, I think)I haven't found anything yet that the book mentions but I'm definitely better informed for the search!"
2,Thank you for the warning.,"Ceramic TablewareLead levels in the ceramic tableware sold in our Kitchen & Housewares Store comply with FDA standards. California requires the following separate notice for ceramic tableware on the packaging:Proposition 65 Warning Triangle WARNING: Use of this tableware will expose you to lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm."
2,Ehhhhh,Not super excited at how it loosens up after a while but the concept is cool at least. You can keep other stuff in the too. like business cards
4,"Not perfect, but pretty good","I've been using this product for about a month as a replacement for my regular wallet. It doesn't quite work in that role, but it almost does.Good points:1.) Looks cool.2.) Small, sleek, and compact.3.) Doesn't get soggy when I exercise.Things I wish it did better:1.) Doesn't have enough room to hold more than a few cards. (Not much room for receipts, cash, etc.)2.) The main compartment is the same length as most credit cards. As a result, when you remove the end cap, the credit cards don't stick out far enough, and they're hard to pull out. (This problem can be fixed by pushing a few cotton balls into far end. That also keeps the cards from rattling around when the end cap is closed.)3.) The aluminum scratches more easily than I expected.On the whole, I really like this product. For me, the good points outweigh the bad points. I plan to keep using it--and buy another one if it wears out!"
2,cost deceptive,"There were things that I liked about this case. It holds your cards compactly and safely, and looks like it could survive a lot of damage. however, it is a little cheap looking, and the 5$ price tag is deceptive, as the shipping cost me more than the item. If I saw it in a local store, I would probably throw one in the cart for the kids."
5,Fool a thief,"I have used this case for 3 years. There is nothing I own that consistently gets such positive comments. One of the urban living rules for me is keep only cash in your wallet. So my debit card, health insurance card, drivers license, Amex and Zipcar card fit easily. Nothing get scratched or worn. And if I lose my wallet (for whatever reason) I only lose the money.Great little gift too. I'm getting a couple of extras just in case the darn thing ever breaks - I love it."
4,"Nice watch, but it's BLUE!!!","I bought this watch after mistakenly ordering the 7351260525 model and finding out it was ROSE, not brown. Well, when this one arrived the band is BLUE not black as stated on description. It's a nice watch (if you want blue). I won't be ordering anymore watches online. I have found many other amazon customers to have these issues with other watches bought online. So when it comes to watches or jewelry I will have to look through the limited stock at the stores."
3,Babson takes and old formula and makes it entertaining,"A Fool for Murder is a typical English Manor house mystery. The master of the house returns from a lecture tour with a new wife, much to the consternation of his grown up children. Many twists and turns follow to a very satisfactory conclusion. Although the story may seem run of the mill, the characters are marvelous and there is alot of action. The only problem seems to be Babson's difficulty in portraying Americans in her early novels. It is almost as if she never met one. That problem is resolved now, but in her early works she seems to think of us all as characters in Hee Haw."
5,Great story! it helps teach kids how to keep safe online,"My kids love the story. It is a terrific ""read aloud"" book.Faux Paw helps kids learn how to be safe online. The book is a great tool helping young children learn critical safety rules when using the internet. Terrific animation. The book comes with an animated version of the book.The movie won the student Emmy award."
4,Great book for singers studying German lyric diction!,"This book is ideal for singers who are studying German lyric diction. It follows the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), so pronounciation is easier if you already know IPA."
3,They are all here but . . .,"Craig Douglas is an overlooked phenom from Britian who had a very successful but short career. All of his hits are here but . . . ""The Heart of a Teenage Girl."" However, the songs that are contained on this CD are great. There are two versions of ""A Hundred Pounds of Clay"" and they are fun to listen to. Can you tell the difference ? ? ? You will find his versions of ""A Teenager in Love,"" ""Only Sixteen,"" and ""Pretty Blue Eyes"" very similar to those American versions that we are used to. Give this a listen. It may hook you on British chart music like it did me!!"
3,Essential for Howard Tate fans,What can I say- This is more Howard Tate! He is still in good form and the songs are played very close to the original versions he recorded. The band is decent and there are no consessions made to modernize his sound. I Love This Guy! One of the best voices in all of soul music. My all time favorite male vocalist! If You like other Howard Tate records this will not dissapoint.
5,Great Voice,"Excellent album of a true legend! Recording is crisp and clear and the band rocks, especially the back up players.He is now gone but the music lives on."
4,"my first, lol","I saw some others trying to remember which was their first...their first romance novel that is. This was mine and I followed the rest of the series. While I have read better, these definitely did NOT dissapoint!! A pleasure to read and the last (shadow warrior) I have read three times. These books got me hooked on romance. Give them a try."
3,One of A&C's funnier romps......,"I'm no fan of Abbott and Costello but this is one of their funnier romps. The ""Tree of Truth"" skit is particularly amusing and so is Costello's encounter with a native blowhard (Leif Erickson).A funny takeoff on all those South Sea romances that were so popular in the forties."
4,AN ABBOTT & COSTELLO ROAD PICTURE,"Pardon my Sarong was A&C;'s version of a Hope & Crosby Road picture in an exotic setting. This was a return to Universal for the boys after having been at MGM.Bud & Lou are a couple of Bus Drivers who end up on a tropical island and having to face the evil Dr. Varnoff, played by the great Lionel Atwill in yet another evil/mad doctor role that he did so well. Virginia Bruce basically plays the Dorothy lamour role in the film.Bud & Lou are hysterical in this movie and they seemed to have quite a good time making the film. As i said, Atwill is one of my favorite character actors and actually precedes some of the horror stars that would appear in later A&C; films.\Good silly fun."
2,"Good trimmer, but whats up with all these parts",This is functionally a good trimmer but it has a ton of problems. the crappy base has already been brought up but my trimmer was put together somewhat poorly and after the first use the button the back used to change the blade length came off. Granted its still usable but now i have to fish the button out of a bag to adjust it. Somewhat of a hassle as one might imagineLook for something else.
3,decent trimmer,"not the best, not the worst. Does what it is supposed to do. Adjustments are fair. If you are used to a more expensive trimmer, you will probably not like it."
1,Warning: do not waste your money on this trimmer!!!!,"I am writing this review to warn others not to waste their money.I bought this item after seeing mixed reviews on it on amazon, hoping it would be better than some said.It is horrible. The charge on mine didn't last long after about a month, and it died after two months. The tray for all the pieces was poorly thought-out. It was very difficult to put the pieces in it.So, forget about buying this... it belongs in a garbage can!"
4,i enjoy it!,"I enjoy this product. I have gone through several razors and on,y like electric ones.This one is top notch!!"
1,Not designed well,"This cordless clipper is okay but it works alright. I was unimpressed with the stand because there is not a specific place designated for each accessory and that makes it difficult to know where to put them. The thing I liked least about the stand was that every time you take the trimmer out of the stand some (if not all) of the accessories fall out. The stand is not designed well and since that's why I purchased a ""kit"" I ended up exchanging the product for a different clipper kit."
4,Great product but....,I got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base. The charger part of the trimmer is just too big. Even though it is big for size it does not hold all the attachments. He would recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for.
4,Very nice product...,"I purchased this on Amazon in May 2007 and so far, I've been pretty pleased with it. I agree with other reviewers that the base is useless. The product picture you see on Amazon is pretty much how it's going to look on your counter. All attachments beside the charging base. I'm sure someone at the factory could show me how to put everything in it's place but as soon you'd breathe on it, everything would fall. 4 stars from me because it's simple to use and the attachments seem to be pretty good quality too. I'd give it 5 stars if the base was more functional and it came with a better manual explaining exactly what each attachment's purpose was. But it's a good product. It doesn't ""feel"" like a cheap trimmer when you hold it. It has a good weight to it. Overall, I like it a lot!"
2,Broke after 3 months.,"This trimmer worked fine, but stopped working after 3 months. It didn't cost me much but felt it should have lasted at least a year. If you have to replace a cheaper trimmer every 3 months you minds well pay more for a better one that will last you a couple of years."
5,Good product,This has a good battery life and there is no need to charge for long time. thats what i liked. Three levels of trim is pretty good. It does clean trim for the beard.
2,"broke after a month, too bulky for what it is","The unit stopped charging after a month. Also, the head of the shaver is much wider than the body and makes it a bit awkward to put in a travel kit. Lastly, there are no notches, numbers, or anything else to easily line up with the different head settings to make sure that if you take off the shaving head, you will still be getting the same shave the next time you put it on.The blade itself seems higher-quality than the cheap Norelco I used to use, but otherwise this is not a great shaver."
1,Lost Charge,"I use a trimmer for my face and head. I trim about 3-4 times a week. I wanted to make folks aware of my experiences with this product. Seduced by the possibility of going cordless, I (stupidly) purchased this product 3 times. Each time, the rechargeable battery dies after 2-3 months. It's an okay trimmer but it doesn't last."
3,slightly disappointed,i had a cheaper Philips shaver but couldn't use it because it was a 240V device and so picked up this one when it was on sale.many issues with this one:1) low power2) blade angle isn't comfortable3) all these plastic pieces don't really fit well in the holster.. i just shove 'em in the back and pretty sure i will lose these pieces but it seems to be a trend will all the shaversi'm managing with it though and won't replace it. buy it if you need a simple beard trimmer if this is on sale
1,Turbo Schmerbo,"Battery life stinks, ""turbo"" button is a gimmick and shouldn't even be there, and you have to press it so hard it makes shaving/trimming a tight-fisted experience.I'm about to toss it into the trash."
1,NOT Recomended,"When used on beards it has a tendency to pull hairs. It's not a very strong shaver, and battery only lasts about six months and then will not hold a charge. Mine went in the recycle bin. I will not buy another Conair."
1,"Really bad trimmer, a lot of parts","It just didn't trim as well as did my old Norelco. Replacing the parts is a chore, too. The 1 inch and 2 inch trimmer covers are the exact same size and there is no place for the 3rd in the stacker. The shaver was good, but the trimmer was doing nothing. Thanks but I'm going back to Norleco."
4,Love my new trimmer!,"There is nothing not to like about this trimmer! I love the way it works on my beard and mustache, and at 20.00 it is truly a bargain!!!"
3,Why Have to buy the whole thing over.,"I've had this trimmer for about three months, and now the blade is not cutting as good as it used to. It's getting worn out. I see that the blade is detachable but, I can't find any spare blades online for this trimmer. SO I figure you have to buy the whole thing over again to get a new blade. I've even looked on Conair's website. I couldn't believe it; for such a good trimmer, there are no replacement blades. I guess this is done for a reason: so you have to keep buying complete sets instead of just replacing the blade. Conair if you're reading this, Consumer Advice: Make some Spare Replacement Blades!!"
3,"Ok, but...","The shaver itself is great, the small pieces really aren't the problem others seem to think. The one thing I don't like is that you cannot keep the shaver charging and in the holder at the same time for storage! Very inconvienient; I wish I had known before buying it."
3,Good but not precise for detail...,"I can't trim details, can't even align my moustache... will be useful just for apairing and leveling."
4,Great bargain - one minor complaint,"After doing a lot of research I recently bought this model and love it so far. Unlike other trimmers under $20, this one feels very sturdy and well made. The attachments (and there are a lot) don't seem likely to break which is a problem I've had before. Most of the other models I looked at seemed designed for either long beards or very short stubble. The Conair is has so many blade and guide options that it can easily handle any kind of facial hair.My only complaint is that the charging base really can't store all the attachments efficiently. It isn't worth the hassle. Instead of using it I bought a cheap travel pouch for the attachments.If not for that problem, I would have given this trimmer 5 stars. It's cheap, easy to use, well made and can trim any length of hair."
2,Charge doesn't last long,"As others have pointed out, this trimmer does not hold its charge for very long, which can be quite inconvenient. Compounding the problem is that it won't run while charging. And, of course, all the little parts don't fit in their tray very well."
3,Attachments broke after 6 months,"I think this is a decent product for the money, but after only 6 months some of the attachments and trimmer blade broke because they're cheap plastic. Just be careful and you'll be getting a good buy for the price."
3,Charming cats and cute stories,"I got this book as a gift and rather enjoyed it. These sweet, sentimental cat stories were pleasant to read. The simplistic style and preachy message tie-ins were kind of heavy-handed in places, but the tales were entertaining enough that I kept reading. Great gift for the cat-lover!"
5,Satisfied Cat Lover,I enjoyed this book so much I bought it as gifts for a few different friends. We even used this book for a cat-themed surprise 60th birthday party. What a hit! A definite thumbs up!
3,Late 1940's Radio Show Song Collection,"This is a slightly expanded version another UK release (""Hold Tight - It's the Andrews Sisters"" on Dance Band Label). Most of the selections are from the ""Club 15"" radio program from the late 1940's. For die-hard Andrews Sisters fans, this is worth collecting for the CD artwork, the liner notes and a few more moments from the ""Club 15"" radio show. Note that the songs ""The Best Things in Life are Free"" and ""Come Home"" are not performed by the Andrews Sisters. This is not a good collection to purchase if one is seeking a packed CD of crystal quality Andrews Sisters tunes."
3,Wrong voice,"A very solid rendering of this spectacular score, Solti is still the best among the pretty-boys who have come after. This recording is marred only by the choice of Domingo as the Emperor. Poor timing and awful diction coupled with his flowery timbre make the scene in act 1, which happens to be my favorite, almost unlistenable. I never thought I would miss the scratches and pops of the old Decca and DG recordings, but I guess I do and would trade gladly for them to hear a young Jess Thomas or even James King sing this role."
2,An over-praised recording,"I think this recording has been over-praised. While the performances are decent, it is by no means outstanding, and I'm referring to both the conducting and the singing. Solti's interpretation is safe but not incandescent, and I don't like Domingo's unidiomatic performance as well as Behrens's wiry tone. As there're few versions of this opera in the market, this set may still be recommended. But it is far from perfect."
2,Disappointing Frau,"The soloists are disappointing except for van Damm's Barak and Varady's Empress, although beautifully sung, seems over powered by the assignment. The rest of the cast is tired sounding."
3,bizarre,"if anyone figures out what this opera is about, let me know. strauss thought of it as his die zauberflote, and i guess it is. like the flute, it's a fairy tale with an emperor and empress, a wicked nurse, and a talking/singing hawk. i like to think it's strauss' attempt to do a wagner. like w, die frau is long, loud, and pretentious. it's 3+hrs of monotonous screeching and bellowing, punctuated from time to time by some of the most rousing and sometimes beautiful music you'll hear anywhere. the last half of the last act, especially, is beautiful. the rest of the opera i can live w/o."
4,GREAT VIDEOGRAPHY OF A GREAT FIGHTER,"I had seen this particular piece on cable years ago and found it very compelling and well put together. When I saw that it was available here on Amazon.com, I snatched it up immediately. Just watching how this supremely talented and much maligned fighter lived (and died) is both entertaining and saddening. The home movies interspersed with TV and fight footage along with the haunting jazz music in the background makes for a ""package"" well worth the money. It's hard to say that Liston wasn't one of the greatest boxers ever, after watching this."
5,I keep copies on hand,"I really like this book. I keep several copies on hand, and when I hear of someone with coping with a stroke in the family I have one to give to them right away."
5,Well Worth the $,I have been using Omniform for several years and have found that Omniform filler fills a gap. You do not need to purchase the full version to allow all employees to have the ability to complete routine and repetitive forms without the need for a typewriter of hand written forms. Thus saving time and money. It is easy to use and cost effective.
3,A Little Disappointed,"First, mine didn't include an Ipod cradle.Second, there was no auxilary port so that you could plug another device into the system, which should be a standard feature on all stereo systems of this scale. Very disappointing.The sub woofer was too big for the space where I had plan to put it.Finally, though the product photo shows the display area as black, the area is actually is a mirror silver, which is disappointing as well."
4,not as advertised,"This system sounds and looks great, but it does NOT come with an iPod cradle!! On the box it specifically states that the iPod cradle must be purchased separately...although I have not been able to find it yet on Amazon or any other website!"
3,"Not as advertised, underpowered, but OK sound quality.","The system has acceptable sound quality, and good looks. However, as the other reviewer correctly stated, it does NOT come with an iPod cradle. Instead, you simply have the *option* of purchasing a separate iPod cradle accessory.The system is also underpowered; it is quieter than an acoustic piano."
3,"Sounds good, functions could be better","Purchased this as a gift. Was told that the system sounds good, but the functioning is not as versitile as others.For the price though is it not bad"
5,I love this stuff!,I love the sound of a baritone sax. Listening to Brignola and Cuber burn their way through the up tempo tunes makes me want to go out and take lessons. This is an enjoyable CD with a good variety of tunes that give these two masters of the bari ample room to stretch out and demonstrate chops that are amazing. The Rein De Graaff trio that backs up the bari duo is every bit as competent as the headliners. Good stuff!
1,Price = :(,Look elsewhere for this GREAT series. It really is a very fun and informative series to watch. But three big ones for this set? ...what a rip off.
2,Don't like the taste,"Recoverite is a good product, and helps me not feel sore, but the chocolate is nasty. Stick with the citrus."
4,Good Post work out drink,"Was put onto this protein drink by a friend. It is great when you have completed a hard, high intensity work out. I found the drink flavor (strawberry) is actually OK. You have to mix the drink well. Definitely works to aid recovery. I am cross training running, cycling, swimming, and some light weights.Hope this is helpful."
4,Effective Recovery Carb/Protein Drink,"I'm not a long term user of this product. My experience in drinking it after two marathons and two very long training walks has been with the result that my muscles seem to not be as cramped, sore and tight the next day. I'm thinking that it has to do with how the ingredients in the Recoverite lessen the effects of lactic acid buildup in the muscles. Or perhaps it's just mind over matter; although we are what we eat and drink:*) Whatever is happening it seems to be a good thing."
4,Really like this,"Not only does this actually taste decent, but I feel like it helps in my recovery after runs. It reduces muscle fatigue the day after runs, which has allowed me to increase my mileage. I haven't tried any other flavors, but I think I'll stick with the chocolate. Make sure you put ice in it, too. When its colder, it tastes better."
3,A little pricey,"My trainer at the gym says this stuff doesn't do much more than good ol' chocolate milk. Nonetheless, I feel good after I drink it. So I'm going to at least use up what I have."
5,Tops,"I go on long bike rides and after I am zapped, no energy, tired and soar muscles. A friend introduced me to recoverite and wow has things improved. Now when I go on rides and as soon as I get back I drink recoverite and I don't have the tiredness, no energy. The muscles are a little bit soar but nothing like they use to be. I also noticed that the next day when I go for a ride, I am ready to go, muscles are great and full of energy. Tired feeling GONE!!!!!I like the strawberry and banana but I dont care for the citrus. Not a thick drink and it don't give you that bloated gotta puke feeling. The first time I used it I noticed a big difference in how I felt. Try it!!!!!"
4,"Great (SLC, Ut.)","I bought this item for my 2006 3500 Ram, at first I didn't notice a huge power increase. However, my first long trip on the interstate I noticed a nice change in my fuel mileage. I used to get 17-18 mpg hauling or pulling nothing, at 75 mph, on that trip I got up to 21.7 mpg, I was even hauling a four-wheeler and a bunch of camping items. I think it was well worth the money I've spent, especially with the high diesel prices these days. I'll update in a few months..."
5,hmmm diesel,"Easy install, good power but lacking on the mpg. I wanted a little bit of punch and that's what I got so I cant complain.I read a number of threads regarding these and no issues, but after I installed a few chimed in regarding injector issues with 'pressure boxes' type of tuner.I have a 06 5.9 QCSB just under 50k on the ticker."
4,Two polydactyl thumbs up for Welactin!,"My cat (a 5 year old polydactyl tabby, with hip dysplasia) used to take Omega 3 supplements (in addition to Cosequin -- *highly* recommended!) to help her deal with her hip dysplasia, at the recommendation of her vet. Recently the vet changed her from the Omega 3 pills to Welactin. She had been doing well before the change, and she's still doing well. So I can only say the Welactin is comparable to the Omega 3 pills. And she eats it fine, never throwing up. The Welactin is easier to add to her food -- it's easier than piercing and squeezing the gell from the Vitamin-E-style pill capsules that the Omega 3 pills came in. However, the pump somehow leaks every time I pump a squirt onto her food, resulting in a large messy drip down the side of the bottle. Maybe I got a defective pump, and the next bottle won't drip so much. Overall, I'd recommend the stuff. Two polydactyl thumbs up for Welactin!"
4,my cat copes with it,"My cat recently was diagnosed with arthritis and this was recommended by the vet. I wouldn't say my cat loves it but he eats it with only slight hesitation when we put it on his food. (My other cat, without arthritis, has no problems with it, of course). He has not vomited because of it but I would agree with the person complaining about the squirt bottle. Mine too, leaked all over the side, making a big sticky mess. Besides a poor package design, the supplement has been good."
4,Window to Paris DVD,"I bought this DVD when I realized I had accidently ordered a VCR for my husband for Christmas.The video quality was good, but the translation interfered with the quality of viewing. There were times when there were both subtitles and a voice translation - too much confusion. But my husband seemed not to notice and enjoyed it thoroughly."
1,Disappointing,"After watching the preview of the movie at the beginning of another DVD, I tried to find it for rental. Unfortunately I couldn't locate it, so I decided to buy the DVD. I should have given up when it was not available as a rental...after watching about 30 minutes of this amateurishly made foreign film, I shut the player off. Complete waste of my money!!"
3,This Foriegn Film is awesome it's like The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe,"This is a funny film that I saw already. it's about a musician who discovers a magicwindow on the streets of Paris France. I just love this film the way it was made.It's the best russian Film of the year. I absolutely love this movie because I wantto go to Paris when I turn 16. Sometimes I can imagine if there is a magic windowin my house,It's very french."
1,Wrong Verve!,I haven't even listen to this. I wanted the Verve from England. And I got some group I never hear of shipped from Brazil. I really feel cheated out of my money.
1,Thike as Thieves... they take your money & send broke products,"order a Polaroid JoyCam it came broke (without the inside parts were the Film intant).1st they said they would send me the missing part... They never did.Then they said they will send out another they never did & kept my Money.I'm mad as Hell.They sould not be selling anything on Amazon!They are bad news and thieves.M.G.From Palm Springs, CA"
1,Junk!,This was bought as a second camera to do Polaroids for charity events. Don't waste your money on this. Go with a nice Polaroid or a digital with printer. This went in the trash!
2,better than before but still needs improvement,"My friend and I just went to Italy and took this camera along with my 35 mm camera. We took the JoyCam for ""just for fun"" type pictures but it became a hassle. Because of the sleek design it was hard to hold on to. The strap is attached to the part of the camera used to pull the film out so you can't use the strap as a handle. And we kept accidentally hitting the button to take pictures because there is no safeguard against it. It is smaller than other polaroid cameras but still a bit bulky. I didn't find it very good for travel."
1,Where is the talent girlfriend?,"I love dance music but she has this ""little girl"" voice that needs some serious work. Her slow songs are awful. I know this sounds harsh but she sounds like she's tone deaf. I don't know how this one ended up with a record deal."
2,bit locks and jams up,had no problem with the seller just the product that i recieved used it once and the bit got locked into the dremmle and i cldnt remove it so yet again i sent it bck im prolly gonna get a corded dremmle from them but not a cordless one to much hassle
2,Battery stinks!,"This dremel is nice, but the batteries they come with are awful, I have already gone through 4 batteries, in 1 year.They never hold a full charge after 1 month!!!!!!!"
3,Cuts out under load,"I've been an avid Dremel user for years; ever since I got my first one in the late 80s/early 90s. I was excited at the potential for a cordless Dremel. It's light weight and comfortable to hold in the pencil position (unlike their 12V models which you have to hold in your fist). Battery life is great, especially considering it's size. My only gripe is the ""feature"" that shuts it down under load. You have to turn the switch to off for a few seconds for it to reset. It shuts down waaaaaay too easily. That's my only gripe but it's a significant one. Half the time I still pull out my corded model because this thing keeps shutting down when I'm trying to do something with it. Fine for very light use but not by any stretch a replacement for a corded model."
1,Poor Quality,"I barely used this model within 8 months it broke. Same as two other users, I concur that quality has gone down dramatically with Dremel products. This particular model failed to operate after being used very lightly, the speed dial ON/OFF switch does not work anymore. I still have my original cordless Dremel I purchased 18 years ago and works great."
2,Batteries are a problem,"The tool works OK but I've had two batteries go bad in the six months I've had the tool. They are expensive! Rather than continuing to shell out for batteries, I may just stick with my corded one."
2,Not the Dremel from 20 years ago,"I have been using a Dremel tool for a long time, the old ones had great ball bearings and powerful motors. Today, both the cordless nad the corded units are mass producted and the quality is fair at best. I have gone thru three of these 10.8 volt cordless. As soon as it heats up during normal use, it shuts off or starts to smoke. Once they smoke they have had it! Buy a new one. Customer service is great, but the tools are not what they use to be."
2,To hot to handle,First I would like to say I like the portability and the LI-ON battery power. I also purchased the right angle head and found that to be a handy add on. However while using the tool (at any speed) the motor housing and the right angle head literally gets to hot to hold and actually burns the hand. Dremel you have a problem here. Perhaps a recall is in order.
1,Dremels are made to break. especially this one.,"I;ve been using dremels for years, and i'm fed up. The quality of the product has gone down hill fast. I can't get one to last for more than 80 hours of work. in 2006 the dremels easily lasted for 400 hours. This is the worst one the the plug-in dremel is a little bit more durable. I've had other rotary tools; i had one a friend gave me that lasted for over 2200 hours, and i received it in used condition. it wasn't a dremel. I'm someone who spends a lot of time on various projects using rotary tools, dremels are a waste of money."
4,great tool,I like this tool. I was surprised on how long the battery holds its charge. I liked the tool so much I bought another one for my son.
3,Dremet is a good product,The cordless use is too bulky for a women to hold constantly to smooth things. It looks much lighter in the photograph. You have to know which size to buy for your personal use.
2,"Worked great, for 4 months :(","Bought this for my husband for christmas. thought i was getting for a pretty good deal. he seemed to really enjoy it until it broke 4 months later. unless you only plan on using it once in a blue moon and only for light projects, i dont recomend this product to anyone...well maybe my enemy."
3,Great when it works...starting to short out,"I bought this product for some household jobs, but mainly for my dog's nails. It started out working great and rarely needed a charge. However, just a few months ago (having owned it for about 8 months and only used it maybe 10 times) it started to short out. The variable speed dial shorts out at certain low speeds. At high speed it's fine, but I don't use it for any high speeds. For the low speeds, it sometimes shorts out and can be a pain.Also, the case it comes with is nice, however it doesn't go a great job at holding any of the accessories. Unless you lay it flat and DON'T carry it by the handle or store it upright-accessories are going everywhere!"
1,Not as advertised!!!,"The product was advertised as including 40 accessories, I only received only 10. I should have listened to the seller's reviews."
3,Pictured is NOT what i recieved,"This product comes in a small box...way too smal for that nice carrying case, instead i got a little bag for all the attachments and the Dremel...ordered mainly for the fact it came in a solid case or so i thought...prolly wil not order from here again. Hoping the dremel is the one pictured and not something else but its a Christmas gift so i cant open it to find out"
5,Fantastic!,"This tool has all the power of a corded one, with convenience of cordless. Dremel did a great service to woodworkers and hobbyists by coming up with this one. I can't think of any way of improving on this great tool, other than Dremel offering an extra battery without having to buy a second charger."
2,Problems with parts!,"Overall the unit is great, but wait untill you need you need a battery or charger replacement....I don't think my charger ever worked properly. A new one is almost half the total cost of the unit.....Battery about the same!"
2,Handy for some things but Stalls way too easily,"This can be very handy when you need a Dremel tool but can't or don't want to get out the extension cord. Biggest drawback is that it Stalls way too easily and that trips the internal circuit breaker. Then you have to shut off the tool, wait a few seconds, then you can turn it back on. That means that a lot of simple quick jobs are going to take a lot longer than they should have. Only option is to be very very careful not to Stall the tool but then it will still take longer to finish the job. I'm not using this tool anywhere near what I had hoped to, instead I'm getting the extension cord out and using my regular Dremel. Other drawback is that the Battery Packs are very expensive considering their size and power. I would still buy it but overall I'm disappointed with this tool and will continue to look for an alternative that doesn't have this tool's problems."
3,It could be a lot Better!,"THE GOODThis Dremel 10.8 Lithium-Ion Cordless is very light and easy to use. It very versatile because it is cordless!THE BADThe bad thing is it runs out of power too fast and it takes 3 hours to recharge. I don't know anything about the ""smart charger"" mentioned by a previous reviewer.If I connect the Flex-Shaft and fiber reinforced cutoff wheel, there is only enough charge to slice one 3/8 inch bolt. Then it takes 3 hours to recharge the Lithium battery.WHAT DREMEL SHOULD HAVE DONE!Dremel should have designed it with a 18 to 20 Volt Lithium-Ion Battery that will truly ""quick charge"".I will dump this Dremel when one of the other ""name brands"" comes out with a more powerful lithium cordless rotary tool. Unfortunately, Dremel is the only game in town at the moment."
1,"Battery charger faulty, didn't even last a year.","After ordering 3 new battery chargers, I'm ready to give up on this product. The battery has also given me problems as it must be turned and taped in place to make contact with the tool. Too many problems."
5,The best,This dremel is the best cordless rotary tool out there it has plenty of power with power to spare there just isn't enough room for me to say how good it is. Plus the customer support is just amazing they care about the customer and they are willing to help above and beyond.
3,Dremel drama,"Bought this tool to replace a very old corded Dremel. I was initially very pleased with the power and handiness of the tool, and ended up using it more than I ever used the corded model. I don't recall the time span, but in months rather than years, it started to be a little loose around the battery compartment, and finally got to where it had to be wiggled and twisted to work for brief spurts. Now the indicator lights come on, but the tool won't start. Eventually, I'll take it apart to see what I can see, but meantime I bought a 12 volt 8220, and that baby has really impressed me. Feels like a solid tool, and lots of power. I like the 10.8, but it just didn't hold up for me."
5,Excellent product..confusing case,"This dremel is solid, and got the polishing and cutting tasks done that I needed it for. Only problem is that the _case_ could use an instruction booklet for all the attachments... You'll end up just keeping the attachments in their own plastic bag, but that's no reason not to get it."
4,Not New?,The unit I received appeared to be used or refurbished. There were stickers and other plastic around the tool. However there were scratches and wear marks on the tool as if it had been used already and wasn't factory new. The tool seems to operate normally but I expected a new product.
3,Great for moderate use,"I bought this to go where you can't go with a cord or with my Foredom Power tool.It's not perfect & won't go everywhere that I'd like it to use it.I've had it over a year & like it allot, but there are some things I didn't like about it:First: & most important would be the lack of a separate on/off button from the speed control.I caught myself accidentally hitting the speed dial when putting it away in it's case= not good.Second: it will bog down & stop if you push it too much.I'm not hard on tools & have quite a few tools older than 5 years old, including my Foredom Power tool.I was looking for a second battery & noticed that Dremel has come out with a newer 12 volt version that has a separate on/off switch.Now I'm torn between getting another battery for this unit ($40.00) or another Dremel for 100.00 more..."
5,Awesome tool!,"Seriously great tool. The included case is a bit bulky for my needs, but this thing rocks! Variable speed, adjustable chuck you can actually open by hand. I only had to use the included wrench once after some high speed sanding. I've used this thing about twenty times yet and it does everything well. Drilling, grinding, sanding, etching, everything! The battery is pretty long lived and charges quickly. It can be loud at high RPMs, but that's how you know you're getting higher torque right?"
5,Dremel 8000-03,"I'm happy with my purchase.I worked for 7 years as an authorized electronic tool repairman.Worked for a Skil associate repair shop, & we worked on everypower tool in sight:Skil, Milwaukee, Black & Decker, Porter Cable, Makita, Ryiobi, Dremel etc.My Dremel model 410 type 3 has served me for what, 19 years?I purchased a Dremel model 8000-03 2 months ago, and am glad.Saved me $150 the 1st time I used it.That it's cordless is important to me;it can be used anywhere.The battery life seems good.This model has an important feature which many may overlook.It's variable speed.Most tools of this type are 2 speed,yet if one looks at the 120+ bits available,each one has a rotary speed to get the job done right.Only a varible speed tool can use these bits properly.Whatever tool you choose to buy, pick a high quality one.You'll be glad later."
3,"Not Ready for the Pros, But Handy When Needed","Whenever a manufacturer presents a tool powered by batteries, it is my opinion that the re-charge of said battery should, at least, be close to the time it takes to drain the power through use of the tool. I purchased THREE batteries for use in my Lithium-Ion Cordless Dremel, and still had to wait an hour and a half when It ran out of gas. UNACCEPTABLE. I figured that I would need two more batteries, and another charger, or two, to be able to work constantly with this tool. Dremel, please find a way to reduce the charging time from three hours to one, and, market a charger that can charge multiple batteries at once. Until you do that, this tool is more of an interesting toy than anything else. Please note, I give these tools HEAVY use, and I will ALWAYS recommend Dremel products. Just not the battery powered ones at this time, unless your jobs are short, and light duty."
1,Fragile and cheap,I bought this dremel kit to do small projects on my car. The battery life is NOT as advertised and the dremel became defected within an hour of use. The speed control became defective and now it's either ON at full speed or OFF. This piece is cheap. I don't recommend buying this
2,Model 800 Broke After Warranty Expired - Won't Charge,"Bought at Home Depot on 10-17-06 for $69.99 + Tax. Worked OK, but did have the annoying battery life and shut-off/restart problems others write about. I was still happy with it until I pulled it out to use it this year. I turned the unit to on, but nothing happened. So, I tried to recharge the battery. Still nothing. Don't know if it's the charger or the battery. So, it's dead after 3 years with very little use in the past 12 months. I was considering the Model 8000 as a replacement, since it's the 10.8 V unit. Looks like I could use that battery for mine, if needed. But, I've read so many bad reviews on this site that I think I'll pass. May go with a corded one the next time. For now, I don't have a project that requires this. It was fun to use with my son on his pinewood derby car. Found other uses, too, but a corded one would have worked fine."
3,Get what you pay for,"I own the Fein Multimaster, but thought in the long run, it may be cheaper to buy and maintain the Dremel version. As most people know, the Fein tool is expensive, and hard to justify if you use it only occasionally as the family handyman. It is in a league well above the Dremel tool however. As soon as I started my first cut with the Dremel, it was obvious it was $300 cheaper than it's Fein counterpart. The price of the two units really says it all. You are definitely getting a high-end tool with Fein, and an ""affordable"" version of the same product with Dremel. My Dremel is back in it's box, and I just ordered new attachments for the Fein. EVERYONE is making a reciprocating tool now, and short of buying a Fein, I would advise that you definitely check them all (price v. quality) as best you can before purchasing."
2,not satisfied,"I'm not ""handy."" Still I know more about how to assemble the Dremel tool from the picture on the Amazon page than I do from the instructions. As far as I can see, no collet is in my 40 piece kit, and you need one to operate the Dremel. The instructions assume I know. I don't. Dremel should pay Youtube. We'll find out about this collet business there."
2,Delicate Tool,I had wanted this Dremel for quite some time but I found this one to be much too delicate for my use. This particular Dremel Tools' (and perhaps all Dremel motors) use of what would seem to be plastic internal gearing make it unsuitable for tasks such as cutting a single thin wall tile -- even though Dremel sells bits claiming to be designed for this purpose. I mention plastic gears although I have not disassembled the tool to confirm this suspicion but regardless of the actual material used this item is too delicate for some uses that Dremel claims it is capable of. Caveat emptor!
3,dissapointed,"The item was very good,and works well,i love it,and the fact it has no cord is great when im using it,but the fact i couldnt recharge it because of voltage differences in Australia,was not good,i certainly received help from you regarding this problem,and i have purchased a voltage regulator,which cost over $40 dollars with postage ,therefor making it a more expensive item,i was refunded $20 which helped towards the regulator,but it should be that items offered for sale should be ok in the countries they are being sold to,so this is more constructive criticism more that a review,hope it may help in the future ,regards,Brian."
3,Not Everything Expected,"Don't get me wrong, Dremel Rotary Tools are nice ... and the idea sounds great ... but I've found the reality to be that they are less useful than initially thought.Another drawback ... the price of accessories. Dremel must think their poo don't stink, because the prices are outrageous on accessories (which you'll need to make the tool useful)."
2,Not so happy,Iv owned this tool for about a year with little use. Tonight it failed me. I needed to cut though some drywall aparently this thing is not sealed verywell becuase the motor speed switch shorted then the motor finaly gave way. I assuming the drywall dust did its part. Well what a waste of my money. I bought this muti purpose tool so that I can use it on whatever comes around. well I am going to buy the older corded dremel and have at it. Herd they hold up forever. NICE job dremel what a piece of junk.
2,Quality?,"Add me to the chorus of people who had the speed control burn out. I had my last cordless Dremel for 10 years. It wasn't the most powerful beast, but I use it mostly for pet claws, so that was okay. When it died, I bought this one. It worked fine at first. Kind of big and bulky, bit it did the job. After a few months of light use on the dog, I tried it on an actual project, with actual...wood. The speed control went south, and the thing has two speeds now, full speed, or off. It's useless for the dog now, or much of anything else for that matter."
3,Nice but underdesigned,"I bought one of these at a local brick & mortar store for a project I'm working on. I am impressed with the power of the device and it is a really neat tool, but unfortunatley I've already had to return two of them for a defective speed control. While using it, the first one all of a sudden just jumped up to full speed and stayed there regardless of where the speed control was set. In other words, it was no longer variable. The second one did the same thing. Since I saw replacement brushes available for their tools (and therefore they must consider it somewhat user serviceable) I decided to open it up and see what it looked like inside. One of the transistors on the circuit board had gotten warm enough to melt the solder and shorted out two of the pins on the transistor. I'm on my third one now (just returned them at the store) and I first bought one about 2-1/2 weeks ago. Great tool but Dremel needs to work on their quality control."
5,Dremel Lithium Ion Rotary Tool-Model 800,"Finally, a cordless rotary tool that holds it charge while being stored. Now I don't have to worry about charging my tool's batteries the night before I need it for a project. And the Lithium Ion batteries are environmentally safe--unlike Nickel Cadmium batteries.This tool is surprisingly smooth, yet seems as powerful as my old standby corded Dremel Model 395. At 35,000 RPM it is the fastest cordless rotary tool I've seen on the market. I like the sleek, ergonomic design. Based upon my previous experience with Dremel tools, I expect this tool to be trouble free for a long time."
3,Suprised that it broke,"I used this for all sorts of little tasks with main one filing my dogs' nails. Last night it broke while using the tile cutting blade to cut a plastic housing to remove an automotive speaker. Well, it really didn't ""break"" but it smoked profusely and the rotary speed dial is difficult to turn but the speed is still there. I'll be sending it back for warranty (had it for 20 months) but I fully expect them to tell me that it was due to misuse. Cutting plastic with a tile bit has to be something this is capable of handling. This was the most demanding use I've had with this Dremel so far and it has been great until now. My last Dremel was a corded version that lasted better than 15 years. I now have a 12v 8200 on order."
5,Great Little Tool!,I got this Dremel for Christmas and it works great. The battery pack holds a really long charge and the torque on the motor is amazing! Nothing like I've ever felt before. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice cordless dremel or rotary tool.
4,Good product,I bought one 2 years ago. Love it. Holds charge well. Good torque. Very happy with. The on/off power wheel seems to wear down meaning the slightest touch might turn it on. Doesn't bother me. I just bought 2 more. It was $30 cheaper than the newer model at home depot. Been happy with product and amazon
5,I would reccomend this product to anyone!,"Other than needing a second battery, this is an easy tool to use and no cord to get in the way!"
5,You don't know you need it until you have it!,"I actually purchased this for jewelry making. After that short lived dream died, the Dremel arrived and I was at a loss for what I was going to do with it. But lo and behold I didn't realize I needed this thing until I had it. Scratchy nuisance on the back of my shoe, I used the sanding piece to fix that. Screw without proper grooves for the screwdriver to fit? Dremel! My husband wants me to build him a little house for his queen bumble bee (don't ask)? Dremel! Now I stalk around the house just looking for an excuse to use it. It's cordless and amazing. What are you waiting for?"
5,"Good product, nice improvements over older models","This is used for plastic model building and was a replacement for an older cordless Dremel that was destroyed in a basement flood. The new tool is much more powerful, has better speed control and has a much longer lithium ion battery life. I am only grinding and sanding basswodd and styrene but the finish with the higher speeds is ideal. Well balanced and quick to recharge. Very satisfied with my new tool. My plug-in Dremel is almost 45 years old and is still used weekly. Its only repairs have been replacement brushes every ten years of so. Great products from a good company."
2,Use practice tests from CBEST wesbite instead,"The Reading section of this book was not just harder than the actual test, it was ridiculously incomprehensible, and not indicative of the level of questions asked. I was freaking out because I could not pass the Reading section in this book, so I did a practice test from the website. I scored 97% on that and then got a perfect score on the actual Reading section of the CBEST, the next day. This book caused me so much undue stress, I would not recommend it at all."
4,Pretty Close,"It's not exact, but it's pretty close. Maybe a touch more jamaican allspice and a bit more cocoa and you've got it. The great thing about this spice packet is that you can use whatever quality of beef your heart desires. I like the 1.5 lb organic ground beef from Costco."
3,Not What I Remember,I use to buy this years ago from Grand Union but when they went out of business I never found it any place else. I was so excited when I found it on Amazon! It was not that great and not what I remembered. I would try it again but I was disappointed.
2,Just doesn't cut it,Cooked this item after browning meat in crock pot. Just doesn't make it as the recipe for Cincinnati Chili my dad gave me. Worth the try.
3,"Has nice featueres on paper, but doesn't work well overall","Pros: 802.11n, usb storage link / print serverWhen this access point works, it works well, but it doesn't work a lot of the time. I have a lot of problems connecting 802.11g clients and connection via 802.11n isn't available right away after connection is initiated."
4,to the guy below me,"About the 400 degreez being/not being the standard of southern hip hop. You said that the master P album came out in the late 90's, well so did 400 degreez so obviously i know what i'm talking about. And that is your opinion that the master p album set the bar. I want to know how many units he sold in comparison to 400 degreez, which sold 4 mill. Also look at the status of no limit and cashmoney now, so obviously people like cashmoney more, now cashmoney is not the head of the game but they have a name for themeselves, unlike no limit who has fell off."
4,Not bad!,"This cd has some good production. Although it is not the best no limit release, it is worth a listen. I would like to see more guest appearances. Overall not a bad cd. The track with Petey Pablo is blazing. It actually sounds like Silkk took his time and did some thinking about his lyrics.But don't expect any NAS like, deep lyrics,but he has improved. Tracks 1,2,3,7,15, & 16 are good.."
2,I'll answer,"Master P's Ghetto D debuted at no.1 on the US pop charts and went on to sell 3 million records. Juvenile's 400 degreez was a slow seller initially, but some singles helpes the album climb into the top 10 eventually. 400 degreez has sold 4.5 million so far.By the way, this album by Silkk is unoriginal, uninspired, and clumsy. Buy that B.G. OR Lil Wayne album instead."
4,Poor recording quality spolis readings,"Although Solti will always be the definitive interpreter of Wagner, this CD of some of Wagner's most famous orchestral works is a bit disappointing. Although the Vienna Philharmonic is in top form and the vision Solti brings is fantastic, the poor sound quality (a rarity on London Decca) makes this CD less appealing than it should be. Barremboim's recordings with DG are not quite as solid as Solti's, but their crystal clear sound and responsive playing from the orchestra makes it a more attractive buy."

5,enthralling,"i look forward to Clive Cussler's latest release, his books are always fun, interesting & captivating."
5,Diamonds are not a man's best friend,"By far Clive Cussler's best book yet. Almost an unputdownable book. Only weaknesses albiet small was the beginning and the end. But the middle towards the end, how my gosh! I couldn't put it down! A different spin in every chapter!"
4,Shock Wave!! A very good read,This was my first Clive Cussler book and it will not be my last. The book was a fast read filled with lots of action. The only negative that I could come up with was that Dirk Pitt would escape tough situations a bit easy. Bottom line Shock Wave is worth your time reading!!
4,"MY FIRST CUSSLER...AND BOY, WAS IT DANDY!!!","After being suggested Cussler, I was overjoyed to find an adapted version during a scrounge at Borders. Gee...there is no shortage to the action, is there? It was a very interesting plot. Heck, even the 40-page starter was good enough to make a seperate novel. Just one problem: I don't know how many times Pitt was ""staring in the face of death"" or ""finally meeting a challenge that could get him."" After a while, it got boring. Yeah, Cussler's way of getting him out of death's way was cleverly written, but....Anyways, I encourage (the people of all ages, now!) you to get this exciting book!"
5,Cussler's BEST,"In my opinion, this is where Dirk Pitt reached his peak. This book has everything. I hate romance stories, but this... Whoa. I have to say it was the most emotional novel I ever actually enjoyed reading. Giordino's in top form, the villains are outstanding, and Pitt gives another reason why he's cooler than Bond. Dirk Pitt's a nice guy. Bond, for all intents and purposes, is a womanizing jerk. (This is not a knock on Bond. Bond's great, but he don't hold a candle to Pitt.) READ THIS BOOK."
1,"The name is Pitt, Dirk Pitt","My first ""Dirk"" (and last). I'm astounded at the lavish reviews. Ian Fleming's Bond could get away with this stuff because it was fresh. This effort is just plain silly."
1,Grave Dissapointment,"I was loaned this book by the president of our company. Generally I admire and respect this man's opinion, but I would have to say in this case he was sadly off base. This book is not worth the paper it was printed on. The characters are contrived, the plot twists are implausible, and in general the story comes off as silly and very unentertaining. I am able to understand the necessity of needing to make a story entertaining by stretching the feasibility of the plot. This book stretches too far and the plot too far however to make it completely farsical. Mortally injured hero's coming back to save the day in an unplausible situation, are not my type of heros. I was sorely dissapointed in this book and will probably never read another Cussler book again."
5,last 100 pages are nonstop action,"One of the best books i've read in a while. some boring parts, but mostly a page-turning adventure. Good, but not so satisfying ending."
4,Shock Wave,Awesome novel by a great author. continues to be among the best adventures ever created for his readers. Hope the son keeps the series alive.
2,Shockwave,"I have never heard of Clive Cussler before and was give this book from a friend. He said it would be worth reading since I love fiction. He gave it a so so rating and said I would know why it wasn't great when I finished.I read to enjoy the story line, so when the main Female character gets killed after surviving everything thrown at her, I likewise do not recommend this book. It reminds me of the movie ""The Perfect Storm"" where all the main characters are killed. I was advertised with great movie stars, but after seeing it, no one recommended it. I don't like walking away after finishing a book or movie feeling bad. This book had all the makings of a great book but like my friend, I cannot recommend it due to the ending.Could have been a great book."
3,Not Cussler's Best,"This entry in the Dirk Pitt series starts out with an exciting prologue, the story of a harrowing shipwreck off the coast of New Zealand, whose survivors found a mysterious diamond empire. Dirk Pitt stumbles into their web when investigating mysterious deaths at sea. The author gives away the who, what and why a little under halfway through the book, a mistake in my opinion, there was no incentive to read further."
5,a very SHOCKING book,this was the first clive cussler book i read and it was the best book i ever read and i would give 10 stars if i could. if you really liked this book as much as i did e-mail me at ARMY_DUDE_2000_99@YAHOO.COM
4,Better supporting cast development,"The theme is still basically the same as the previous novels, but in Shockwave Cussler uses more of the minor characters to save the day instead of just Pitt and Giordano. I like the extended character development and hope to see more of the supporting cast in the future."
2,Shock Wave's sound wave plague is ridiculously ludicrous,"I have to say that the ""high-intensity sound wave plague"" that is the back bone of this book is totally absurd. There were parts in this book related to the sound waves that were supposed to be suspenseful that instead were just roll-on-the-floor funny.I like a good adventure book, but not one that is so ridiculously unbelievable.This book did have a few great Dirk Pitt moments, but unbelievability of the the sound waves or the lunatic Arthur Dorsett were just too much to take.If you are looking for Clive Cussler, look to some ""Listmania"" lists and try to find one of his better books.I would pass on Shock Wave."
3,A bit of a bummer,"I hate to say it, but this was the one Clive Cussler novel I had trouble with. It was one of those books that I put down and picked up, put down and picked up, etc... The descriptive writing is still there in classic Cussler style, but in the end I was disappointed with the storyline. Most of Mr. Cussler's ideas and storylines seem to make me think, ""Wow! That could be reality!"" But this story was just too ""out there"" for me."
3,A Little Sloppy,"As usual with Cussler novels I couldn't put it down. However, Ifelt a little like Clive was just going through the motions on thisone, which is too bad 'cause it could have been another ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". Yes, there's major character develepmont for Dirk and that's a welcome change, but the book is sloppy in other areas. It felt like there were too many conveniant right-place-at-the-right-time moments. Also the mystery of the ""sea monster"" neither seemed fully developed or based loosely on historical/scientific fact. Which are two things you can usually count on in a Cussler novel."
4,JAMES BOND MEETS MOBY DICK!,"MY FIRST CUSSLER NOVEL, AND DEFINITELY NOT MY LAST. THE ACTION IS CONSTANT, THE CHARACTERS ARE GREAT, THE TWISTS AND TURNS NEVER END. MY ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THAT AT TIMES THE BOOK GOT A LITTLE TOO DESCRIPTIVE, HOWEVER, IT MOVES ALONGVERY QUICKLY. I AM ANXIOUS TO TRY ANOTHER DIRK PITT ADVENTURE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY FAN OF ACTION/ADVENTURE, BUT DO NOT READ IF YOU PLAN ON TAKING A CRUISE IN THE NEAR FUTURE."
5,Clive Cussler returns to form in exciting fashion!,"After following Dirk Pitt from Pacific Vortex through Shockwave,I have yet to encounter a bad read from Cussler. Shockwave isespecially satisfying since some of the complex plotting andsurprising twists Cussler used in earlier works such as Treasure,Cyclops and Raise the Titanic return in Shockwave. I was especiallyintrigued by the state of the rare gem industry as conveyed by theauthor. While the book lacks 'solutions' to historical riddles thathave been so prevalent in Cussler's previous books, it still is verymuch another exciting Dirk Pitt story."
5,It holds your intrest and delivers a new side of Dirk Pitt,"A suprising ending with thrills from start to stop. Pitt shows a side never before seen in any Cussler novels. He's as rugged as ever but still shows a softer side when the enemy hits close to home. This book will leave you cheering for Pitt, and cursing the bad guys. Any Cussler fan will be laughing,crying and loving the ever classic, yet different, believable Cussler ending."
5,exciting!,This was the first Clive Cussler book I read. I usually read things like Mary Higgins Clark so this was off the beaten path for me. However I actually loved It! Dirk Pitt can get out of situations that are truly not possibe to escape.I jsut finished reading Vixon 03 and am currently reading Flood Tide. I am truly a Dirk Pitt fan now. part of the appeal of Clive Cussler's books is the contiunation of Dirk's character from book to book. Love it!!
1,"If you like preposterous and corny, this book's for you","My first Clive Cussler book will unfortunately be my last. The plot shatters all suspension of disbelief with heroic near-deaths, corny romantic dialogue, and at least one whopping geographical error (the ocean between Australia and South America is referred to as the ""South Atlantic"" - p.332). Add the author's continuous references to previous Dirk Pitt adventures (""buy my books, please!""), and you get a tiresome read. (Judging from the above, the author needs a good spell-checker too."
1,A truly unbelieveable tale!,"I'm still wondering why I continued to read this book! I have to admit to skimming the ""worst"" parts, and I guess I kept thinking that it would get better. It didn't! The situations are beyond realistic fiction and yet not original enough to be science fiction. The characters are so unreal that I kept saying, ""Give me a break!"" The sole redeeming factor was the occasional scientific information, but the way that was inserted into the story - particularly the diaglogue - made it less interesting. My first and last Cussler book! Florence Lesko"
2,"Strong start, bad finish",This book starts out strong. It seemed like it was going to be the best Pitt novel I had read to date. But then enters the completely unbelievable plot to save the day. I suggest reading the first 100 pages and then moving to another book.
2,Well-Written Religious Garbage,If you do not believe in the religion of global warming and corporate consiracy theories your eyes will pop out of your head every two pages. The best part of this book is the lead-up to the main story line. The main story line is more suited to a scooby-doo episode than an adult action novel.
4,Shockwave,"Shockwave a book by Clive Cussler is a very good book, it's about a new weapon that has been developed and is threatning to the world which causes the character Dirk Pitt a NUMA agent who has to help put a end to the weapon for the safety of the world. You have to take the book for what it is. There have been many of books that have to do with the same subject just not much of them are written as good with detail in the plot. A good thing about Clive Cussler books is that they all have very diffrent plots one could be about a secret weapon threatning the world and another could be about find some secret artifact lost from existance for thousands of years. Comparing this book to others that kids like to read like The Lord of the Ring's or Harry Potter. Clive's books on the other hand have to deal with different things and not fantasy beings."
2,Too Many Guest Repeats,"Carol could have picked better episodes. Steve Lawrence is pretty plain and so is the acting. I remember when this was first aired and I always felt disappointed when there was a guest, such as this. It made for a boring Saturday night."
5,a better Human Being,"The world needs more people like the man whose life is explored in this book. Taken from interviews with those who knew Crazy Horse in varying degrees, he is consistently shown to be highly principled, ethical, and devoted to the welfare of his people. His example best expresses the difference between a ""Leader"" and a ""manager"" or ""CEO"". All are necessary, be we have lately begun to mis-order their importance, and have begun to choke on our own bitter mediocrity."
1,Piece of Junk,"For all you dad out there looking for a quick way to get a pinewood Derby car without all the cutting and measuring - Look Elsewhere. Okay so the car is cut for you, but that's about it. It is supposed to come with paint for the car. The car is orange and white on the box but the paint they give you is red, silver and black. Also the red paint will not stick to the plastic pieces - it just flakes off after it dries. I had to buy white paint and prime the plastic bits and the red paint still did not adhere very well. Also the stickers do not stick very well - and they give you stickers that do not match the box. Lastly - once i put the wheels on, the car was off kilter. The right side was higher than the left so i had to fix that too.If you are looking for a cheap, quick pinewood derby car i'd just buy one of the small packages that has the car already cut and then plan on buying paint, stickers and flare separately."
5,Let there be light!,I love my Coleman latern but thought the light bulb was going to be impossible to find. This bulb was reasonably priced and delivery was fast!! I recommend this product and seller!
3,Good,"A simple bulb requires a rating, what a joke. It either works or it doesn't. If it doesn't you send it back, no brainer."
5,"Great Choice! , Get this one!","My daughter wanted the Polaroid I zone. After the reviews on Amazon about the I zone, I chose the Joycam. Great choice. Picture quality is excellent! Pictures compare favorably to my Polaroid Spectra. For indoor shot's, Watch out ,and make sure that when you want to take a picture, that you turn the flash on first ,or you will lose a shot. Fun camera ,great pictures ,great choice!! Thanks to all the Amazon customers that wrote reviews on the I zone , and saved me frustration!"
1,Disappointed with the camera,"This was my second polaroid camera and 6th camera overall. I got it for my 9 year old daughter. The pictures tend to blurry, half of the time they came out ""over-exposed"" i.e. too light, although we followed the instructions and kept atleast three feet distance. THis was true both indoors with flash and outdoors without flash. Also, as another reviwer has commented, if you do not pull out the photo quickly, a portion of the picture gets spoiled. Overall, given the high cost of the instant film, (Polaroid makes most of its money on the film) and the 50% probability that a decent photo will come out, this camera is destined for the junkyard in our house."
1,Junk!,"This was a terrible purchase. It was bought to be a fun and quick camera to use for fan shots for charity events, but it is not worth the money at all. Invest in a REAL Polaroid camera or digital with printer. You get what you pay for, but I did expect better with this one. Mine is in the trash, as I would not even consider giving it to someone to cause them frustration."
2,Not as good as MS controller,"I wanted a second controller that was smaller than Microsoft's standard controller so I bought this one.Although this one has a slimmer profile it still doesn't feel much smaller. Also it has a number of flaws:1. Both analog sticks have a dead zone before game registers movement--MS's controller doesn't2. Every single button isn't as sensitve as MS's controller (e.g. you have to push button farther down).3. The right joystick is moved farther in than on MS's controller making you have to extend your thumb inward--which is less comfortable.On the other hand the A,B,X, and Y buttons are better positioned and more conventional shape (like playstation controller).I would not recommend this controller over Microsoft's unless you think button placement more then compensates for the other flaws."
4,Empire Level E95.48 48-in Magnum Plus Pro Level,"Excellent product. Very durable and accurate. Only one suggestion would be to have a window view on the narrow edge of the level. Other than that, ""she's a beaut"""
3,Stark and minimal ambience,"A sort-of offshoot of Coil, this release finds them exploring barebones ambience. Not as drone oriented as the later Time Machines material, this release is based on the premise of false starts, mistakes, sounds that shouldn't have happened. The result is surprisingly fragile and stark. A bit more abstract and sterile than most of Coil's repertoire but worthwhile nonetheless. (This is a reissue of an album that was released in 1996.)"
1,coil's least favorite,"I love coil's stuff but not all of it. When it's good it's really good, but when it's bad it's not only bad but you most likely paid a bit to find out. Okay...my best picks for Coil is..Love's Secret Domain (L.S.D.), Spoild and Contaminated, Black Light Distrect, The Snow, Autumn Equinox, Gold is the Metal with the Brodest Shoulders. Unfortunatly I spent alot on the other ones that weren't very good in my opinion. Early stuff too close to Peter's roots in industreal. (Throbing Gristle)Well ultamatly it's all subjective. I hope this hellped somebody anyway.."
2,Avoid,"I wanted to buy an indoor antenna better suited for HDTV. It turns out that my regular old indoor antenna does a much better job than this particular model. Stations that I can receive clearly with minimal signal loss on my old indoor antenna, the Futura doesn't pick up at all. I tested both antennas on the same day in the same location."
2,Not too good...,"I bought one of these at the local hardware store. It was out of the box and hooked up in 5 minutes. Downsides: No power light or switch, so when something doesn't work it's hard to tell if it is due to the hookup, tv settings, or power outlet. Also, there is a long telescoping antenna (not pictured) which makes this antenna much less wife acceptable. I managed to finally get 2 hdtv channels to connect roughly 100% of the time, but then magically the power adapter must have given its all - so back to the store for a refund. Happy Thanksgiving for HDTV!"
1,a waste of money,"I bought this antenna at a local store because I had two TVs not connected to cable but only one pair of rabbit ears. I wasted my money. The old rabbit ears that came with my 20 year old TV set blow this thing away in terms of reception, and I can't get a single digital channel on the GE antenna but can get 10-15 with the rabbit ears. In fact, when using the signal strength meter on my DTV box I can actually see the signal strength DROP when I plug in the antenna's power supply. Just buy something else and save your money. Also the F-connector on the back is not very secure, I tried several different cables before finally realizing that the antenna was the problem. Only a screw on cable will work with this, the push-on ones won't grab."
1,Beware !,"When I plugged this in to my Satellite Receiver it pulled in quite a few HD locals, surprising as I am surrounded by mountains !! BUT after one night it died, I exchanged it and after one HOUR it died !!I purchased a Philips instead and it is pulling in even more channels, plus so far...it's still alive.Avoid this product at all costs !!"
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"I have an HDTV and I thought could use this indoor antenna to pick up more local HD channels instead of having to connect (and pay monthly charges) for another yet HD cable box. This did not turn out the way I wanted.Reading the advertisement at a B&M; store, I thought it was cheap enough to give it a try. Unfortunately, all it brought in was 3 channels. These channels were local public broadcasting channels like I wanted but nothing else was received. Weak signals messages flashed across my screen for all other channels. I live in the NYC area so I thought more channels would be available, but this was not the case. I moved the two antennas that pull out in all kinds of directions will no better success. I placed the unit itself in different places with the same results.Maybe this would work better in conjunction with an outdoor antenna? I am not willing to attempt this and will return it."
1,Horrible Antenna,"This product manages to be worse than rabbit-ears. I could barely pull any signal off this thing, even when I tried, as an experiment, putting it outside on my roof.If you are looking for a great digital antenna, buy an old-school aerial antenna and put it in your attic. That was the best solution for me."
2,Use at your own risk,"I got my T40 (512mb ram) last summer. After working well for a few months, the hard drive and motherboard went bad and I had to send it back for repairs. After getting it back, it worked well once more, but now I am having frequent problems with overheating when running intensive applications. I would recommend buying another brand with similar specs - thinkpads are overpriced anyway."

5,Excellent... If you're looking for the basics...,"If you liked the vocal opening for Serial Experiments Lain, but don't want the other BG tracks or aren't familiar with Boa then this a great way to go. You get Duvet the original and the remix! (Which is fun to listen to but REALLY changes the song around...) Anyway, I would consider this a starter set and if you like it, go for Twilite or Race of a Thousand Camels. Boa does not come short in any of their songs (But Duvet is my all time fave)"
4,"Great book, but kind of basic","The book was really good, but the labs aren't even close to as difficult as (...other) ones (...)They are a good start, though."
2,Too Simple ! Don't get misled about the theory of Network!,"Based on the comments on this book, I bought this book two weeks ago and so far finished most of the Labs on Cisco Lab. It is kind of useful for the first time learner about the Network theory without any experience of hands-on.If you look at the Lab carefully, you might find out those Labs are the simplest ones in the world, not in the real production world, even for understanding the concept of network protocols !I am afraid of the reader might get misted to the concepts of network through those Labs.Although this is the first book on the market about the CCIE Lab, please be careful on the understanding the concepts of network - not just through those SIMPLEST situations !"
4,Excellent book for intermediate level labs.,"This book basically takes you through many of the technologies you will meet in the real world and on the CCIE lab in 80+ well written scenarios.However, this book alone will not get you to the required level to pass the CCIE lab, so don't misinterpret the title. This book is great for people who do not have that much hands on experience with cisco routers. For the CCIE you will require a much more indepth understanding of all topics covered, plus several more topics which are not covered at all."
1,Not coming close to a CCIE Lab preparaton book,"The title of the book has nothing to do with the content. The Lab exercises are very basic, NO Bridging at all.!? No Dlsw configuration, No complex exercises with more than 3 routers having more than one protocol IP,IPX,APPLETALK, no voice configuration, no protocol type access lists. I would not recomend this book to anyone. Even for beginners, there is a much better collection of books."
5,The best for the money so far,"This book does a very good job of covering the majority of scenarios that are covered in the Cisco CCIE Lab. What's more the experience of the authors'shows, I have found the bolded items in the configs invaluable as I follow the labs in the book. The coverage on MPLS and Frame Relay was especially useful for me.I have purchased other CCIE books that state they cover the lab exam and they don't measure-up to this book. If you have to purchase one CCIE Lab book, make this the one you buy."
3,"Good book, but not quite CCIE level.","This is a good book to use to study for your CCIE, but it is does not contain enough, or anything on the following important topics that may come up on your CCIE lab DLSw+, SNA, ATM Lane, OSPF area types. Although this book does cover most of the other topics I belive that they do not go into enough detail."
4,Great labs = good hands on- if you've got the equipment.,"The labs in this book are excellent but it would really help to know going in what type of routers and related equipment is needed for many of the labs.Can't fault the material. Covers ISDN, access-lists, debugging, troublshooting, all the major protocols and even some switching.If you've got the gear, the labs are excellent. You'll also need experience. This isn't a book for newbies."
2,Will not prepare you for the lab test,"Book has many errors which may be good to help you learn troubleshooting, but I don't think that was the authors intent.Subjects are not covered well enough to get you through the CCIE lab."
3,This book is good but lacks a few things,"I like the labs on NAT, ATM and BGP but ...What happened to -DLSW+, Bridging - Transparent, SRB, DECNet, X.25, Queuing, NLSPVijay."
3,Good starter book for CCIE Lab preparation..,"This is a good book. I would recommend it to anyone who is in quest of their CCIE. This book will get you started and help you to get your feet wet when it comes to the labs, they are not in depth but will get you started. If you don't have anywhere to start and don't want to jump right into some really heavy duty labs like the CCIEBOOTCAMP labs then this book is for you. Great starter book."
3,Lacks complex labs such as those on the real CCIE lab exam,"The book covers just about all the technologies that may be on the actual lab, but it is missing Multicast. The book has many labs but it fails to combine different technologies in them. For instance, each chapter is on a particular technology(i.e. routing protocol) and all the labs in that chapter only contain what is covered in that chapter. The real lab exam will combine a single network with all the technologies combined and that is what this book is missing. Furthermore, some of the labs do not cover enough of the features within a technology. For instance, the ATM chapter contains only 2 labs which only show you how to configure a basic PVC. Also, SVC's for Frame Relay and ATM are not covered at all.Overall the book is practical for one who wants to practice the basics of each of the technologies and not complex designs or features. If the book did not have ""CCIE"" and ""lab"" written on the cover, I might have given it at least 4 stars."
3,My opinion,"I used this book during my early prep for the R/S lab. There are errors, but still a pretty good book. It however is not even close to the complexity or depth of knowledge required on the actual lab. Just my opinion (and yes, I am a CCIE)."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I've met these guys about a month ago while they were down here visiting Cisco, and these guys are total clowns. The book ought to be entitled ""Networks for Dummies"". The cover is false advertising, and anyone who says otherwise probably is having a hard time passing the CCNA. What a joke."
1,"Errors upon errors, did I mention errors.","I found myself correcting the book as I was reading it. Router configs are missing necessary commands and have incorrect configurations. It is obvious that configs from other labs were placed in the wrong section of text. Labs are very simple as well, do not expect to see the level of labs in this book anywhere near your real lab exam. On a positive note the book does cover a fair amount of subject matter that will be on the written exam."
5,Pavarottti and friends,Once again I adore listening to Luciano and also to the CDS and DVDS he has with other singers at his performances
2,Friends without Paravotti?,"Some of the selections have no Pavarotti and no friends, and the recording quality was bad. The Duets album was much better."
3,Not one of the Outlaws best,"I picked this one up because I had it on vinyl and I don't have a record player anymore. In the Eye of the Storm is not as consistent as the other original Outlaws Cds, the first six or so. It does have a great cover of an Elvis Costello song, which goes to show you how back then it didn't matter what genre you resided in, a good song breaks down the barriers. I really liked the original line-up, so I'll hold on to this one. Hurry Sundown is the quality music that I'm used to."
2,Unremarkable,"The Outlaws give it another try, and come up short once again. Only a slight improvement over their previous release (Playin' To Win), the material on In the Eye of the Storm is largely forgettable. Only a few tracks are worth repeated listening (It's All Right, Blueswater and Too Long Without Her, all of which harken back to the band's early glory days). A couple of tracks show promise (Dance With Me and I'll Be Leaving Soon) but never quite seem to gel. Maybe it's because they sound like Burton Cummings is singing them?Once again, though, the CD sound quality is substandard its almost criminal, rendering another poor album virtually unlistenable."
4,great,"video quality is superb,left out one star because it said it delivers audio and video...........only got the video..........using on a msi 890gx with a msi 5000 graphics card and a32''tv........watched avatar on bluray"
3,Lovely bracelet but not very sturdy.,"I bought this bracelet back in August 2010 and I absolutely loved it and wore it all the time. Unfortuantely, after a few months of wear the elastic broke and all the charms fell off. My mother recently bought me a new one as a birthday gift so I'm going to try to be a little more careful with this one. For the price I wish it were a little better put together."
5,I Read Banned Books Bracelet,The transaction to purchase this bracelet was very smooth and also very speedy. The bracelet arrived quickly and was in a cute little gift bag. A+++ Transaction and Seller!!!
3,"a nice statement, but a minor failure as jewelry","I was pleased with the bracelet in that it was as described and pictured. I had no problem with the elastic. I was pleased with the price, shipping speed, and item in general. However, in person, it sort of fails as jewelry, because it has no unifying color scheme; it neithers goes nor clashes with anything, and it's not bright or eye-catching enough to be a conversation piece, really. I'll wear it for the sentiment/statment expressed, but it isn't going to be one of my favorites."
2,"Cute idea, but needs work","I love to read books, so this bracelet was up my alley. I love all the books on the bracelet, but it is so cheaply done. The string that holds it together is so cheap and not worth spending the money on it. The charms are better, but still not that great. If they could do better on the the string, I would buy all my friends one for Christmas."
2,"Cute, but needs to be made better!","I really like this bracelet, but it is cheaply made, and when I wear it, it leaves stains on my skin where my wrist meets the bracelet, it looks like dirt, not sure if my skin is having a reaction to the metal used to make this. The elastic is very thin and cheap too, so I'm a bit concerned about breakage, but so far it has held together. Looks great, just wish it was made better."
3,Cool but needed reassembly,It's a very cool thing but it came in the mail with the 'string' that holds it together broken into multiple pieces.
2,Only good for first 3 month use.,"I bought this for switching my external HDD from the computer to the smart TV and vice versa.The cable length is 3m and 1m each.It worked fine for very beginning then it started to show the error message like either computer or TV couldn't find the device. It seems to be from the switch connection is not precisely working.It has very simple circuit board when I opened the box. All you need is just one multiple toggle switch for 4 signal lines from a usb cable and wires.I don't know what they installed on the electric board instead of that.If they didn't use the electric board or the useless LED lights, the cost will go down to a couple of bucks.Over 15 dollars is totally insane. The nonsensitive switch is needed to replace or upgrade."
5,Unconditional love...,"is how I describe my relationship with this compilation series. If you've got a sadistic bent, they're always great choices for parties and/or unsuspecting guests, and I am so looking forward to hearing a higher-fidelity version Young Rick's ""Over The Rainbow."" I first heard Jim Nayder play this for Scott Simon on NPR's Weekend Edition, and Scott Simon nearly died (laughing?). Keep away from easy-shatter glass."
5,The War On Truth,Finally an astute and scholary work on what really transpired on that horrific day in our history. This book refutes the fantasy 911 report composed by the Bush adminsitration! A must read for any American citizen concerned about the future of this country and the direction the Bush administration is taking us.
4,great book,"read it. it has tons of info. it retains its objectivity by using high level references and not making any suggestions (like a lot of conspiracy books e.g. remote controlled planes, ...). nafeez tries as much as possible to stay to the facts. book reads fast (english is not my mother tongue). if everything is true what is written here, then we live in a crazy world where 99,9% of its inhabitants don't know what the rules of the game are: oil, money, power, business, world dominance, ... . and governments go far as to attain that, further u can imagine. us government let 9/11 happen. they sat on all the info leading to it. why? read this book."
1,Garbage. More Conspiracy Theory Money Grubbing,"This guy is notorious for his drum beat of conspiracy theory feces. We get it, he hates the US. He likes to make up facts and draw connections that don't exist. Read at your own peril or you may end up like one of these 911 Truther retards. Even their leader has changed his story and given up on the cause."
1,Bunk,"In the footsteps of ""The Protocol of the Elders of Zion"" and "" don't bother with the man behind the curtain "" I won't waste anymore time with this conspiracy rubbish as the nutcases have come out and decided that right is wrong and wrong is right..up is down and water is dry. I just love the post 9/11 neo-historians out there who buy this hookem because they are too lazy to read but a small piece of the Pan-Arab -Petro-induced fusion into the media and anti-American so called professors who take up space in our colleges and universities because the are self appointed ""experts"""
3,"No, not the best Cenerentola.","Trust me: buy the Abbado recording now selling 2x1 even without the libretto. Abbado is a far greater, and I mean FAR GREATER Rossini conductor than Chailly, and Teresa Berganza...well, there is really no comparison with Bartoli. The Spanish mezzo is superior in every department. Luigi Alva is a more musical and aristocratic tenor than Matteuzzi. The 1971 DG sound is still excellent."
5,Totally delightful,"If you're not sure you'll like opera, this recording will convince you. Delightful from start to finish, it leaves me humming for the rest of the day. Bartoli's voice is absolutely beautiful and heartfelt, not mere vocal pyrotechnics. The whole cast is a treat--as is the orchestra."
1,One of the worst opera to listen from CD only!!!!,"just so boring to finish this opera from CD.doesn't matter who are the singersonly exception that you might enjoy this CD: if you are an Italian, al least you will know what is going on.Otherwise, you will be lost.never buy this CD before you listen to at least once.This CD doesn't deserve even one star!!!!"
3,Well written but...,"This is a very well translated book that comprehensively covers all the ancient upanishads fairly concisely.However, I was disappointed with a couple of things:1. The commentary before every upanishads could be pointed to the intended purpose behind each of these upanishads instead of offering the reader the salient features of it.2. For a novice reader, the book will sound repetitive and the message will begin to be pointed towards ""nothingness"" fairly quickly. A better introduction and context to each of the upanishads can keep the reader better motivated."
5,Be,"This collection of ancient aphorisms point the reader in a direction that mankind has lost touch with in this era: inward.Beyond becoming aware of the inner processes which create the self subjective reality, these teachings are not intended to be read as pure aesthetics. They are intended for application and self-discipline, which in turn cultivate the only field which bears the fruit of realization:EXPERIENCE.Experience is king, and like all great things, one must work hard to attain the fruit of disciplines labor. A rarity in this world, most animated corpses are looking for a quick fix that can be applied in a shallow mental manner while bringing about the self-deceptive state of progress. Such a path leads no-where.If you are reading this book and wish to extract more than the ""pretty prose"", application will bring one to the source of Desire. For all others, it will remain an intriguing book to leave on the coffe table in order to impress the walking dead."
5,Wonderful,"I am not qualified to review this great classic, but I love it. I will read it over and over again. The author does a fine job introducing the dialogues. What is contained is priceless. It's about the Self, and realizing the Self. After you reach this point, you will no longer need books."
3,"Superbly Written, but Freudianly Boring","The book is extremely well written, and while it chronicles a pivotal American artists life, it quickly digresses far too deeply into the unconscious of Thomas Eakins. Eakins sexual preferences are alluded to at the turn of every page, and how it shaped his life. Every symbol and pose in the artist's photographs or paintings is considered homosexual in nature and at times stretched just a little too thin. Hidden phallic symbols pop up all over the place throughout Eakins paintings and the relationship between Eakins and his mother is repeatdly psychoanalyzed and refered to page after page. The book gets extremely repetitive, very quickly."
4,Kids love it,"My 5 and 3 year old love this story. The art is pretty cool and the story is so-so. I understand the idea... live and let live. You eat your way and I will eat mine, which is a great message... maybe a bit more on being a vegetarian? I don't know, it is a kids book.The drangon is great though!Heather mama of 5"
2,not about being vegetarian...,"it's really more about tolerance, which is good! of course we all need to work on that but being vegetarian or vegan is not about tolerance it is about INTOLERANCE! we must not just sit quietly in our garden behind some beautiful brick walls hiding from the animal-consuming world. that is not to say that we should be militant either, on the contrary we must be vociferous about our veganism while exemplifying the peace and happiness for which we stand."
2,Somthing to consider,"The product description says you get 18, 1 inch layer, applications of the argon. I would have to assume that if you agitate the bottle in any way you would disperse the argon and then negate the effect of it. This is unless the argon re-settles to above the wine again."
3,Good but Unavailable,"I bought the hummingbird ultra wine saver system and really like it. It preserves the wine and retards oxidation to the point that the wine tastes the same day 2 as when first opened. My frustration is that I can not find replacement cartridges and even after emailing the company several times, I get no answer and can not find them on-line. Don't buy it if you can't find the replacement argon cartridges.Tony"
3,Doesn't really make that much of a difference...,"Used this on two bottles, doesn't seem to make a really material difference... seems like it helps a bit, but not really long enough."
5,Sharks in the Shadows,This book is a must read! It gives the reader great insight on a dying culture and the Samoza Regime that helped destroy it!
5,A Game Changer!,"This documentary is well produced, the imagery is beautiful and the claims of the authors and guests are nothing short of astounding. Scholars have long known the Bible is the most accurate work from antiquity known to man. The assertions of authenticity proposed in this work move Biblical claims from well documented facts to virtual eyewitness certainty. Muslim, Hindu, Atheist, Agnostic, Cultural Christians, Religious Christians and Christians all need to familiarize themselves with the importance of the ""Magdalene Papyrus."" This DVD is a good place to begin. Right or wrong, true or false the implications of this work will change the way the world understands the Bible forever. The rules of the game have been changed! Do yourself a favor and become an informed player in the game of life!"
3,"Great concept, but doesn't adjust to fit crib",I received this mobile as a gift and was very excited about the remote control feature. I got it all put together and tried to attach it to the crib and found out too late that it doesn't adjust to fit thicker crib slats. ... . Too bad it isn't made better.
4,My son loves it,My son is 10 month old now and Ibought it during his first month.This has lasted all these days.( Changes Batteries a couple of times).And even now he loves it.It is very durable and fun. NowadayeI use it to wake him up withoutgetting angry about his lost sleep. :)
2,TOO LOUD,I bought this mobil because I liked the idea of symphony music. Returned it 2 weeks later. The music is too loud for babies to go to sleep. My son got nervous and scared from the noise. Although the remote is a great idea. I did not care for this product.
3,very nice,"A very nice mobile - but doesn't like up as much as I thought it would. Grandson likes it ok. Is better than many - but not so great that I can get work up any great enthusiasm over it. If you'r looking for a nice, good attention keeping mobile - it fits the bill. The only problem we've had so far is the remote doesn't seem to want to work very well. If you're willing to spend more & get flashier - you might want to shop around a bit. But you still may come back to this one."
2,Loud and requires a lot of battery changing,"My infant daughter loved this mobile, but I found it way too noisy and loud. Not even so much the music, but the mechanism that operates the mobile to turn around is loud, like an engine is running it. It does not play for very long and although the remote is great, having to go up and restart the thing to me would wake up a dozing infant.I had to change out the batteries after only 5 or 6 times of usage during the week, which is not a good thing. I switched to rechargables but the way to change the battery requires you to take the whole mobile down and use a screwdriver to change it out, which is an absolute pain.It is now sitting on the floor in my baby's closet, due to not being bothered with it anymore."
4,A lifesaver!,"My son, now 4 months old, was not at all interested in the cute mobile we bought to match his bedding - so my mother bought him this one. I was a little resistant - I liked the cute one - but my son LOVES the Sparkling Symphony mobile. Why is it a lifesaver? Because it's the one toy guaranteed to keep his attention (happily) long enough for me to take a shower every day!"
2,MOTOR SOUND DROWNS OUT MUSIC!,"I wanted this toy so bad for my newly born daughter and searched everywhere for it, only to find that it was overpriced and awful! The motor that turns the mobile is louder than the music! I don't know how anyone could sleep with such rachet. Too bad fisher price cannot make a quieter motor. I would have loved this one otherwise, it was eventually taken down and returned to the store for a wind up one."
2,WAY TO LOUD!!!,"I found this toy to be way too loud. My baby would startle the minute I turned it on. I don't know why they don't have a volume control on it. There is no way that my baby would sleep with the music on at the volume that is available for it.Also, if you have any other Fisher Price things that turn on remotely they will be turned on at the same time!"
5,can be dangerous to children,A defective battery combined with poor placement of the battery compartment caused a near tragedy when battery acid leaked down into my daughters crib. Thank goodness she wasnt laying with her face under it when this happened. My daughter loved the mobile... but any possibility of this happening makes it too much of a risk. I would not recommend use of this product.
4,A great mobile,"My three year old daughter just broke the mobile I had hanging in the crib for my three month old baby and I was reluctant to buy another one because the last one I had the baby showed absolutely NO interest in at all. Then I saw this one at a great price of ... dollars and considering it came with a remote, I didn't have much to lose so I bought it. Well, my daughter absolutely loves it. She turns to look at it, which is great. I'm not sure if it's the blinking lights or the colorful characters but I love this mobile. I definitly suggest it cuz I just don't think you can go wrong with this one. Plus the remote comes in pretty handy so I say just buy it. I'm sure you'll like it too."
3,Good background material but not at all actionable,"I'm familiar with this book as it was an assigned textbook for a graduate level accounting course I taught. Where is succeeds is in pointing out the flaws of traditional accounting as a management tool and traditional cost reduction efforts as a response. Their material on finding and retaining profitable products and finding and retaining profitable customers are especially good. However, there isn't much in here on implementing the ideas and some ideas, especially managing with the real numbers, may be difficult to impossible to implement.So, what's here is a good to great source of ideas in financial aspects of general management. There's just not much on how to take action on the ideas."
4,Flavorful,This is a very enjoyable recording. While is is not clear if it is an all digital recording (probably AAD) the sound quality is good.
1,This CD lacks the lively spirit I associate with Carribbean,"Under the heading of: ""What's One Man's Meat is Another Man's Poison"": I bought this CD based on the March 1999 review for background music for a party. Well, sorry, but I think it could have cured insomnia. I was glad I had listened to it first, since there was no way I would have subjected my guests to it."
2,squeaky,the structure is good but the rubber that is used is not very good. Should use another type. It squeaks and does not squeegee very well. Wolud be a good product if the blade was made up of another type of material.
2,Great suction cup BAD squeegee,"the Deluxe Squeegee, ChromeSorry, but I am returning this item. The rubber/silicon blade is too short to be an effective squeegee. It squeaks and leaves streaks of water behind on the shower walls and doors forcing me to wipe up with a cloth afterward. I hate to give up the suction cup holder though - now that was designed perfectly and the only reason this product didn't get one star."
1,wrong angle for doing the job,"This product is designed at the wrong angle, all of the weight is in the handle so it is not balanced and it squeaks horribly."
2,The Squeegee That Doesn't Squeege,"The design and style of this squeegee is the only thing great about this product. The actual squeegee part does a horrible job of getting the water off of my shower doors and windows. I even tried the replacement rubber that came with it, but wound up with the same results. Guess I'll go back to something less stylish, but more efficient (vinyl bladed squeegee)."
1,horrible,"I thought this was a nice looking squeege, but it does not work. It doesn't clean up the water and makes a loud noise against the glass. I had to revert back to using my old squeege, which was cheaper and works a million times better."
3,"Nice look, works well","I've had it for 3 years now. The rubber blades don't seem to work too well until you've used them a while then work fine. My first blade lasted about two years. The second blade only a few months. I think the rubber must have a limited ""shelf life"". New blades work well.Sometimes the suction cup sticks for months, sometimes only days. I can't quite get a handle on that.Also, I wish it were wider.You can get replacement blades. See comments."
3,Suction Cup Stinks,It looks good and squeegees good but the suction cup holder falls off the wall in a couple of days so now the squeegee just lays on the shower floor.
3,Picture color is wrong!,"Even though description says 'chrome', the picture shows an oil-rubbed bronze or black squeegee which is what I was looking for. Unfortunately what arrived was indeed chrome and not what was in the picture. Works decent after 3 weeks, hopefully the blade lasts a while."
4,Sqeegee,The product works as well as I would expect. It is atractive as well as rugged. past designer squeegees always broke. This squeegee will last a long time.
3,A Bit Corrupted,"This was a two-CD set, generally in satisfactory condition, until the final two cuts on the second disc. There were several pauses in that part of the disc."
3,looks like great quality but the sizing isn't right,"looks like great quality but it didn't fit. The 5X he wears are 4"" bigger than this 6X"
5,Wonderful Christmas Book!,This is a wonderful Christmas book that tells the true meaning of Christmas yet explains many of the traditions that are associated with Christmas. This is probably best suited for an older child who has the attention span to read it all. It is a bit long and wordy compared to other Christmas kids' books. Really enjoyed the story!
1,Expired Film,"The people advertised the film as being still good and not expired. When I received the film, it was clearly expired. Not one photo out of the batch. Some photos were leaking paste. Waste of money. Too bad. Sure wish they still made film for this camera. I'm sure that if you see someone selling this type of film, it won't be properly stored in refrigerated ideal conditions and expired. No matter what they tell you don't waste your money on it. This type of film is long gone and whatever is left is surely not usable."
3,No...Really,"This is Easy to use. Fast in loading, and priced just right. It is a bit smaller than the orginal but this is worth it."
2,Time Wabble???,"If you cherish a good Scottish Highland love story, you may be disappointed by this author. The rhythm is a big stumble. Far too many contractions... And isn't the language a huge factor in the romance of it all??? I bought three of these at once and was so sad as I scanned the other two and found they were all filled with contractions.It could just be me."
5,sublime in every respect,"ok - first, i have to admit that cleveland is without a doubt my favorite u.s. orchestra - after hearing them live for 2 years, i can honestly say that i learned more about music from them than any teacher in my entire life.second, brahms fourth pretty much does it for me symphonically.i have the older szell and dohnanyi recordings, which i enjoy a great deal, but this one easily surpasses both - ashkenazy is a consummate musician and he really lights a fire under the orchestra.the pacing of the second movement is remarkable (only robert vernon's consistently loud viola playing is a distraction)this is what is meant when talking about the ""whole being greater than the sum of its parts.""find it if you can"
2,48 Hours was Better! Nothing New Here!,All I have to say and there has been a lot shown of this case which was aired on Court TV. ABC Primtime thinks they can make a little money by selling DVD products which was aired exactly on television. There are no special extras here about the case. I thought the 48 Hours: McGuire Diaries were more revealing and better in an hour. Cynthia McFadden appeared uncomfortable at times interviewing Melanie McGuire during the weekend before she was found guilty of killing her husband. The show only exploits the tragedy even further for both families.
1,"MFG is the problem, seller is not","There is not proper information on the size/diminsion/cross-bars involved with trying to put this product together.The seller is not guilty, the Mfg. is,, cause that it where the pictures & specs. come from.I ordered & put it together, & it won't fit with the two horizontial cross bars they don't tell you about. Thers is no way possible to install this item.Don't buy it!"
4,It does the job,"Nice color, nice metal, came with some bent pieces that I was able to band back which in turn cracks the paint. Some of the shelving wires were bent. Easy to put together but use your own hollow wall anchors. The ones that come with it don't work properly. For the price it's fine and it suits the small bathroom."
2,It didn't fit,"Shipping and handling was very nice. The organizer is beautiful. But the problem on my case was, the toilet tank is too close to the wall that it's not enough space to put the horizontal bar that goes across. Another thing is, my bathroom has tile from floor to ceiling, I don't want to make holes on the tile to put the two screws that hold the upper section of the organizer against the wall. And the last but not least is their return policy. They discount 20% if you return the item. Too bad!!"
3,No Dzogchen here,"This is a wonderful book by a respected teacher, but don't expect Dzogchen here, nor any ""wildness"" :) I have no idea who decided to market it that way, but it is a shame. The Dzogchen part of the book is, well... 2 (two) pages, and the author basically says that Dzogchen is not to be discussed openly. I do agree with that, as does Longchenpa by the way, but the decision to put ""Dzogchen"" in the title is just a marketing deception.This whole book is about Mahamudra. It covers pretty well the sutra Mahamudra and goes on to describe in some length the tantric and essence Mahamudra. That's it - it is a very nice book about Mahamudra.I can see some people arguing that the discussion about Mahamudra may substitute for a Trekcho explanation but this is not the case. Dzogchen has it's own language and it is not to be found in this book.All in all - three stars from me for title/marketing deception."
3,Swingin' the Dream: Big Band Jazz and the Rebirth of American Culture,"Author Erenberg's historical research is well documented and scholarly. Primary criticism is that the author appears to editorialize political leanings to the far Left. It is asserted in the book that specific musical artists of the 1930's and 1940's were socialist (Communist implied) activists, when their associations with Leftist individuals and organizations may have been more business based rather than of any real political substance."
3,Worth the time and $,"I got more than my time and $ worth. It was a good guide to for getting started with Statspack. However, it looks like they rushed this one to market. The book needs another thorough edit. Not all the scripts in the book are in the download. Most of the scripts have at least one problem. Some paragraphs right next to each other seem to contradict each other. However, if you're experienced with oracle and just need to add statspack to your bag of tricks, it's worth it."
1,Burleson is a hack - skip this book,"Like most of Burleson's books this book is fluffy, wrong in some cases, and marginal in value. Skip this (and all Burleson books) and go instead to Richard J. Niemiec or Tom Kyte. The problem with the book is that at best it gives you a confusing survey of the myriad metrics that an Oracle database statspacks report generates. The 'analysis' of the metrics is cursory at best. Beware, all Burleson books are printed on very thick paper and set in large fonts with plenty of whitespace. This book would otherwise be a fairly slim pamphlet. Save your money do not buy this book."
3,Not what it professes to be,"The book should be re-titled: How to write Statspack Scripts. The book barely touches on the true tuning issues of Oracle9i.A large portion of the book wastes time on Oracle8i architectures that have become obsolete in Oracle9i. The book concentrates on the creation and usage of a repository for information that Statspack does not natively support, and then goes on to either completely ignore actual tuning methods, or simply gloss over them.Whats more, the author's method for tuning (stated in the earliest sections of the book) make little sense to me.WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU TUNE THE HARDWARE BEFORE YOU TUNE THE SQL?HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW THAT THE HARDWARE INFRASTRUCTURE IS INSUFFICIENT PRIOR TO GETTING EVERY CYCLE OUT OF IT THAT YOU CAN?"
3,not what i expected from description,while this is a decent book for someone new to the subject I thought there would be more details and tips about the shot setups and the reasons for doing it a little disapointed but its still worth having as a reference and guide.
3,A Light But Useful Reference,This book is only 155 pages and full of illustrations so it doesn't give you the depth of shot creation that one would expect. Still it is a minor useful reference for your filmmaking shelf. You might trot it out for quick inspiration and then get on with your work.
3,Good but not essential for novice filmmakers & film buffs,"I purchased Setting up your shots basically because it tells and gives you a storyboard shot of differnt camera techniques, Crane shots and editing techniques. For these things I found this bok to be a blessing because it explained a lot of different shots that i didn't know. It also explains them in a very straightforward manner and sites several movie as examples. So why three stars? Mainly for two reasons. One problem with this bookm is that it doesn't tell you how to get some shots. ex. various crane shots. What kind of crane? Another problem is the fact that the author suggests you go out buy book on certain subjects say, composition but he doesn't mention any by name. Overall I did like the very straightforward explanation of different shots. This is a decent book( not essential) that film buffs may appreciate more than fimmakers."
3,Not what I expected,"But then if I'd really paid attention to the title of the book I'm sure I'd have figured it out.While I applaud Jeremys' interests in movies and his desire to make them and share his 'experience' with us this book does not actually teach you anything about how to set up these shots. All it does is point out shots that you will probably already know. One thing that really does grate is that instead of consulting an experienced DP to find out the names of these shots he has come up with his own, which he feels are more descriptive.I'd say that if you have a very short history of watching films then perhaps there is something you can learn from this book. However, if you have any experience whatsoever with a camera this book will prove to be a waste of time and (sadly) money.The illustrations are good. Of a storyboard level and at least give you an idea of how to represent an idea but sadly the book was let down by the fact it didn't really deliver anything useful."
4,Not For Reading But a Great Reference!,"I thought it was going to teach me about shots, setting up, meaning and all that stuff. You should get Setting Up Your Story Cinematically by Jennifer Van Sijll if you want that.But this book is great if you need a quick reference if you are stuck. Maybe you need an interesting idea for a shot, this book will do that or if you're storyboarding. It's really not for reading."
5,Great for Beginners,This book is great for beginners to visualize what a shot is and should look like. I bought this as a christmas gift for my 12 year old brother to go with a canon digital video camera and it has helped him a great deal.
3,Setting Up Your Shots,"I have been using this book in my Video class and it is passable, but should include useable films as examples rather than R-rated films I cannot use in the classroom. While most teens have seen most of these movies, I cannot show them as examples in a classroom setting, due to rating problems. If this is to remain a viable product in the future, the examples will have to be toned down."
5,A Must-Have For All Amateur Directors!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present. Some relatives in Bowling Green got this for, and it's a very interesting read, because they know I love writting and directing movies. The last movie I made was in October, called 'Pumpkin Man' In the book, you will learn about techniques such as Pan, Tilt, Dolly, Zoom, Montage, Open up, Fall down, Fly over, Long shot, Vertigo, and much more. I will definitely use this book when I direct 'Pumpkin Man 2' I highly recommend SETTING UP YOUR SHOTS: GREAT CAMERA MOVES EVERY FILMMAKER SHOULD KNOW!!!"
5,Setting Up your Shots,A great overall summary of the core shots available to filmakers with clear diagrams and good descriptions. Good for the beginner or the professional as a reference book.
1,Setting Up Your Ignorance,"This is without a doubt one of the most worst books I have ever read. It is written for a child and has a tone which will be insulting to anyone who is intersted in professional film making.In some cases the author is simply incorrect in his terminology. The author is a wannabe film maker who has a snowball's chance in hell of ever doing anything other than to write this innane piece of crap.This book was obviously not written by a professional film maker, but by an amateur for amateurs.The illustrator claims to be a ""professional"". The illustrations for this book are equally bad.Don't waste your time or money on this waste of paper."
2,Not that helpful,"I got this book expecting to learn something about cinematography, when to use certain shots and why. This book was ony usefull as basically a dictionary of different shots and lingo. I was expecting to learn the grammer of film to be able to create effective ""sentences"" (or sequences) of shots. For the most part, this book only gives you the ""words"" (or shots) without telling you how to use them and when or why."
4,Don't Believe The Bad Reviews,"Its true, this book does exactly what the author set out to do. To show us a list of different shots from the dolly to the crane, with simple illustrations. Those who gave the book bad reviews completely missed the point entirely. If you want a ""real"" book on shot composition and directing get Katz's ""shot by shot"" Actually I recommend buying both books together. I read Jeremy Vineyard's book in one day and took several notes. For those who think the book was too basic, well you have to start with baby steps and this book definetely helped me. An invaluable reference guide for any newbie filmmaker. Jeremy thanks for taking the time out to watch all those movies and pointing the shots out. Trust me its worth it."
1,Useless,"Don't waste your money, I first read this when I was just begining my study of all things film and even then it offered nothing useful. This book my take you all of 15 mins to read since it is mostly pictures. Even for the beginner this book offers noghting new."
5,Some things never change,"This book was written before virus prevention was fashionable, yet everything in the book regarding delivery systems, methods and policies are still 100% true. I recently re-read it and find that by taking some simple precautions, your risk is minimized. (Note: This reviewer was a contributor to the book)"
5,metric open end wrenches,These wrenches are perfect for working on those small odd size metric nuts found on RC models and Model trains.
5,A Must Read for Fire Officers!,"This is a must read for fire officers! It is very important for those in charge of the business end of emergency services to understanding the legalities that affect the business!Dr. Schneid has done a wonderful job presenting the information to the lay person. While this book primarly targets safety and loss professionals, legal professional will find some value too.The book is well written easy to read."
5,"Her family is keeping a secret from her, but not for long!","Mandie is home for Christmas and she can tell that everyone is keeping a secret from her. Joe tells Mandie that she will not like the secret, but Mandie is still determined to find it out. Meanwhile someone keeps unwrapping the presents Mandie is going to give to people. Mandie needs to solve these mysteries."
3,Not the best in terms of over-charge protection,"Bought this because I have a Skil driver that uses this type of charger and battery. No overcharge protection on this - so battery can only be charged for 3-5 hours. After that, you damage the battery AND the chrager. Only way to tell is to smell the charger - it will have a distinctive electrical burn smell. Not the best design, for sure."
2,Bad Design,"Yes, this is the standard SKIL charger. Alas it is a primitive and lousy design internally - not only does it not have a timer or a level sensor, it does not even have any current limiting at all. (Found this out when I dismantled mine after it failed). If you use it, you MUST be exreamely careful not to overcharge. If possible put it on an external timer - or at least set your wife's over timer to a couple of hours to remind you to unplug it. Do NOT leaving it charging overnight for example - it will overheat and wreck your batteries after a few cycles. I ripped the guts out of mine and rebuilt it using a more robust circuit I found online."
1,poorly,It did not work. We took a Brand new Battery out of the raper and the charger did not work. We returned it to sender.
1,What a waste of money,This is the biggest piece of dung I have purchased in a long time. It melted down the first time I used it did'nt even get the battery charged.
3,Good but Unexpected..,I really wanted to buy myself a Polaroid Camera and when I checked this particular one out it didn't come with the film like it said it was supposed to. The camera did come with the bag and I was about to ship it back but I decided to just keep the camera and start a camera collection.
5,Freud transcended,"Bataille's text represents a cogent, penetrating examination of the topics of eroticism and death, as well as the violence that connects them. He explores some of the links between erotic activity and violence, providing a refreshingly intellectual perspective on subjects typically ruled by silence.Where Freud noted a connection between sex and violence, Bataille explores this connection in light of its broader philosophical implications. His section on Christianity is particularly helpful in understanding how that religion has rendered an entire sphere of sacred experience unto the profane world, with grave consequences for human culture. Never indicting Christianity or condemning it outright, Bataille instead seeks to explain the condition of humanity in the mid- to late-twentieth century--a condition that still very much troubles us today."
3,"Complex, though not remarkable","Bataille's philosophical/anthropological examination into taboo's and transgressions is a fine work of theoretical inquiry, though it ultimately fails to say anything that Freud has not already said in 'Totem and Taboo' as well as 'Civilization and its Discontents.' Although Bataille's familiarity with ethnographic records is stronger than Freud's, his capacity to extrapolate theories from them is far weaker. I believe that Bataille does little in the way of gathering a unified theory of the taboo and transgression, nor does he provide any genuine insight into the connection between human sensuality and death. However, I found his analysis of Sade and the final commentary on sanctity to be quite interesting."
1,Sultry bordering on lethargic,"I was most impressed, and moved, by Ute Lemper's rendition of Weill pieces, and her 'Berlin Cabaret Songs' album. This collection of songs, many made famous by Marlene Dietrich and Edith Piaf, is a big disappointment. The energy, and gut quality of their original interpreters, are missing here. Every song is played at a tortoise's pace, with strange musical accompaniements, the songs hardly recognizable if you are familiar with the originals. A case, perhaps, of Lemper trying too hard to 'modernize' what should be left alone. The end product is embarrassingly self-conscious and shallow."
5,GOT'S TO BE MORE CAREFUL,"MAN, MAN, MAN AND I MEAN MAN. This book was so worth reading, It makes you really think and if it don't something is wrong with you!!! I'm not telling you to start looking at your man all funny, but you never know. having a best friend that is gay. He stated that it is so easy sometimes to pick up a trade.(that is a straight man that they can turn). SO WATCH YOUR BACK AND GET HIV TESTED WEATHER YOU THINK YOU NEED TO OR NOT!!!!"
2,The Only Secret is why People would like this!,"I don't understand this novel. There is NO way that two unemployed homosexual men living as women and preying on ""straight"" men, will be lavished with 20,000 dollar shopping sprees...WOMEN rarely ever get that luxury. This whole book was pretty much a bore. I got tired of hearing about the matching guccis and the additional chanel accessories... Too much label dropping and too little plot worth reading. It is an ok book to borrow from a pal, but please pass if your spending cash. The two main characters are not very realistic, and the fact that they maintain long well-kept relationships and their signifigant other NEVER realizes that their sex is strictly backdoor... I dunno. The book just seemed pretty pointless. But if your into cheesey, predictable drama with a unique twist, maybe, just maybe.... this novel is for you.Final Word: Borrow!"
2,A fast read,"Secret Society is a good novel for an introduction of a new author. She blends a fusion of sex, lies, and deceit. But the dialogue of the narrarator seems to reflect the West Phily roots of the author more so than the main character ""Celess"". The exerpt from her next novel seems a lot more interesting,her style seems to have improved for her second go round, hitting topics other than fly Philly get money girls."
4,GOOD READ,I thought this book was very good. She could have had this book a bit longer but still good book. I have alot of questions not about that lifestyle after reading this book.
3,Some 'Secrets' need 2 b told b 4 u take them 2 your grave!,"Miasha has stepped out ghetto fabulously! She has unearthed a society that will leave you in shock and make you think twice. Every thing that looks good might not be good for you.Meet Celess and Tina, two gold diggers, that are professionals at their trade. They give 'macking' a whole new meaning, because these two ladies work 'it' like it ain't never been worked before. Not at all (pun intended)!Miasha has brought a whole different drama to the literary field and she has it filled with lots of drama, deceit, suspense, and terror of maybe not knowing exactly what you're getting when you think the getting is good! Watch yourself!She's made her entrance with a splash and I know that she is here for the long haul! Congrats Miasha!"
4,Secret society,I love this book I couldn't put the book down read the whole book in two days...it's a great read
1,Puleeze!!,"I did not like this book at all and it isn't because I don't have an open mind. I totally agree with the other reviewer, I did not bond with the characters at all. I need some kind of a connection and it just was not there. I got sick of all the designer name dropping and not to mention the very predictable ending that left me feeling cheated. I'm just glad I got the book out of the library. I wish this author much success in her future endeavors but I will not be getting anymore of her books."
3,MY GAW DROPPED. LOL,"THIS BOOK WASN'T GREAT BUT OT WAS A GAW-DROPPER! IF YOU WANT A QUICK READ ABOUT A FEW DIFFERENT ISSUES DEALING WITH TRANNY'S, THIS IS A GOOD BOOK. I THOUGHT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LONGER BUT FOR A FIRST NOVEL MIASHA DID PRETTY GOOD. I CAN'T WAIT TO READ HER 2ND BOOK, DIARY OF A MISTRESS."
4,be ready for this one,"if you like shocking and surprising story lines, then this book is for you. just be ready for the unexpected."
3,It was ok,"I bought this book and nope I couldn't put it down but it wasn't that great. It's definitely a book to borrow or buy with a discount but it wasn't worth my 12.00. It was very far fetched, but enjoyable."
2,"Good Concept, So-So Execution",This book barely scratched the surface of the intense issues she chose to write about. I wanted to know more about why Celess ended up the way she is today and her motivations beyond playing guys for money. While the drama kept me reading I was left in the end with so many questions still!!
2,Secret Society,"Ok, please tell me why almost EVERYONE would think that this is the BEST book that they have read?!?!?!?!? First of all, it was too much Brand name dropping and then how, just how could these men live like this??? Now this could be a true life of some men out there, but I could not do it. Some of the stuff that was in the book just was not realistic! I'm soooo glad that I read Diary of a Mistress FIRST! B/c if I had read this book first I would have passed on the other two novels that she has wrote...Now Diary of a Mistress was waaaaaaaaaaaay better than this book! I'm so sorry Miasha, please do not write another book like this!"
5,On Point....Men don't sleep on this one!!!,"This book was very intense from begining to the end. It starts off with mystery and lies. This is definitely the book to read if you like to knock books out daily. It took me a day in a half but it keep me guessing. I can't wait until the next book comes out... I read the excerpt and it is real to life, which makes it even more interesting.... The secret society is something serious and I am sure there are many people out there in this society to this day... keep them coming Miasha!!"
3,Men Watch Out!,Celess and Tina spend their time running game on unsuspecting men. Both women are as fine as they come and the men who come in contact with them are taken in by their beauty and pose. But...Both have a secret and if found out could end their lives forever!A good short read but once I knew what the secret was I found it predictable.A great title and cover.LocksieARC Book Club Inc.Star Rating ***3.0
1,"Very little information, and ALOT of fluff","I was surprized when i recieved this book at how little information it really contains. It seems to be the same basic advice, rehashed over and over. I was surprized because of all the"
5,INFORMATIVE AND INSPIRATIONAL,"The Modeling Life should be required reading for anyone thinking or dreaming of getting into the modeling world! Ms. Rubinstein tells you everything (step by step) you need to know to start you on your way to a career in modeling. She takes on all sujects - agents, assignments, scams to avoid, contests, school, etc. There are even in-depth interviews with over 50 working models! I found these interviews to be an added bonus. It was nice to see how other girls got their start and to learn something through their experiences. Ms. Rubinstein's advice is practical, straightforward and honest. Her credentials alone are enough to make any aspiring model pick up this book and start reading!"
2,Stating the obvious,"If you choose to buy this book, you can happily skip the first half of it. The majority of the book's content is case files from models. Most of this case file information seems to state the obvious, although it may useful to some readers in moderation. After reading one or two models' tales the book becomes painful to read - it is the same story told again and again. The book does offer relevant and useful information on modelling (if a little US centred) but you must be prepared to wade through the endless waffle to find it."
5,fabulous for beginners,"this book was really great and a worthwhile read if you truly know nothing about the buisness. the author is the editor of seventeen and tells you the stories of how she developed some models careers and she lets the reader know that it is perfectly normal to get discouraged in this buisness and that most of the top models in the industry struggled for years before they made it ""big"" it is important to be educated about this buisness before you start and this is a good book to look over before you get going. she gives you a list of all the reputable agencies and teels you about all the different ways to get into the buisness weather it be by convention or agency or otherwise. the book is easy to read and understand. the diffeent sections are labeled and divided clearly. it was a very helpful book for me. and if you have the time it is defenitly worth the money! good luck"
2,"ok, but didn't mention things","I recently bought the book and thought it was ok. But it was all for modeling conventions and cattle calls which I think are a big joke. The book made me learn a little, but it isen't something that is great."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,I did not think a book could help so much!! I am 14 and 1 month after I bought this book I got a contract with ELITE MODELS Only 1 MONTH You NEED this book if you want to make it!!!!
4,Spooky,This was a sad tale about children who find a women in a well. Unfortunately the children don't do the right thing and it works out badly for them.
1,Wrong material for the job.,"Bamboo is a great material, but not for cutting boards.if you're a serious cook, especially one who takes care of your knives, you should have a wood cutting board with end grain construction--and one that uses woods with a hardness rating between 900 and 1500. This will be durable enough, but not so hard as to cause premature wear on your knives.Not only are these bamboo boards edge grain (which crashes the knife right into the hard fibers) but they're made out of bamboo, which has a hardness rating between 1600 and 2000. Your knives will dull much too quickly if you use these.Bamboo is great for knife blocks, flooring, bowls, etc. etc.. Just not for this. Spend some money on an end grain board made out of maple, cherry, walnut, or mahogany. Your knives will thank you."
2,"Harder than maple, huh?","The very first cut I made on this cutting board left a huge gouge in the surface. Subsequent cuts also left deep marks. For something that's advertised as being harder than maple, I found this to be very surprising. Maybe it's the way it's put together? All I know is that this cutting board is on pace to be the shortest lived ever in my kitchen. Pretty much the only thing that I like about it is that bamboo is a renewable resource. Good thing because at the current rate, I anticipate needing a new one very soon."
1,splitsville,Had the cutting board for a few months and it split down the middle after taking good care of it with the recommended oil.
4,Essential,"For one already familiar with the work and life of William Grant Still, this is a source of critical significance -- not an introductory monograph. Its one major problem is not informational but one of format: the data on a work, its performances, literature, and recordings are not unified for ready access -- an editorial decision, not one of the authors. Although listed as used, that only evidence was a rubber stamp of a previously owner (a library, which should not have discarded this valuable reference)."
2,Well meaning but smug book,"The point of this book seems that the reason Africa doesn't develop is because people, particularly planners/managers don't have the right kind of narratives (that is, stories)about Africa. With the guidance of Professor Roe, you will learn to believe in and tell other stories, which hopefully will guide theory and practice to participatory development. Let us hope so. The author tells us modestly that chapter 4 (about a British consultant in Africa named Leach) is ""the finest piece I have written."" So, there it is, if you want his finest, this is a good reason to buy the book. The authors says that this is not only his first book on Africa, but his last. His message is presumably too powerful, and the taint of expatriate expertise too negative, for a repeat performance. If one can get past the author's self-serving smugness, as well as the book's repetitiveness, there is actually something of value here."
4,good Dutch music for girls (4-10),If your kids speak dutch then this will be a good buy. The songs are fun and singing along is easy. Also there is a kareoke version of the numbers
2,Save your money.,"This book is too ambitious for what it tries to cover. Perhaps inevitable given it's length. The organizational format is poor, conclusions trite. Just, well, save your money."
4,beautiful pictures,"I owned ""Airborn"" before purchasing this one, and I loved it so much that I sought out Breaking Bounds. I did not hesitate to buy it when I saw it on amazon[.com]. I am a dancer, and the photography of Lois Greenfield embodies the intention and choreography of the dancer so well, that it is unique. I prefer the material in ""Airborn,"" so if your thinking of buying this book and dont have the other, take a look at the other one. I think there are much more interesting and provoking images in ""Airborn"". A downside to Breaking Bounds is that there are no descriptions or captions, other than the artist's name, attatched to the picture. I would like a brief explanation of the picture, as Greenfield does in ""Airborn."""
5,volleyball scorebook,"this book has everything that others book, but cost half the price. Very good option."
1,"Dozing through ""Husher Town""","After reading this book, I was left with one question: what was the point? In this story, a little girl's stuffed animals elect Bear the mailman of ""Husher Town,"" which is the girl's bed. Bear doesn't know how to be a mailman, which angers the other animals. Julia, the little girl, provides packages and letters for Bear to deliver and teaches him the finer points of being a mailcarrier. The animals celebrate the arrival of the mail by inexplicably hanging all their letters from a large tree. If you had just received mail for the first time, would you hang your letters high out of reach? I didn't think so. The writing in Mail for Husher Town is stilted and stiff, much like the awkward illustrations. If you're looking for a better book about postal delivery, try The Jolly Postman."

4,No Matter Who You Love...We've All Been Here Before,"I started this book around midnight and finished it at 3:10a.m.I couldn't put it down.If you want a real ""pager turner"" then look no further.The thing I liked the most was...it doesn't matter who you love...the feelings, the longings...are universal.I found myself identifying with Sadira as I too have tried to make a relationship ""work"" when all those around me knew it was futile from the first meeting.Cheril N. Clarke has done in this book what many authors strive for...she has written a good story.I can't wait for her next novel."
3,It's OK for what it is,"...but the cliches come in fast and hard. The great food. The leisurely meals. The beautiful light. Food markets. (Apparently, produce tastes better when it's in season. Who knew?) The snipes at ""tourists"", meaning people who have a limited amount of vacation per year and are keen to see as many highlights of the region as possible. A piece about Van Gogh was engaging but so many of the stories seem a bit banal. Still, it's cheaper than airfare."
1,"Terrible, basically.","Just as the person below says. You'd think there might be some sort of proof-listening or something for such a release. It's pretty clear not much effort was put into this disc. Come on, are the titles of the songs really that difficult? Aside from that, the interview is very dry and long. Don't buy it."
2,Butterfly with Bullet Wings?,"I'd didn't know that the Pumpkins changed the names of their songs! The narrator had a very strong accent, which was hard enough to pick the words from, but ""Butterfly with Bullet"" wings rang out loud and clear. This was OBVIOUSLY not a reasearched CD, you would only need to look at the back of their CD's to know the name of their first released song wasn't ""I am the One""...But ""I am One"" The only reason that this gets any strsm if becaue of the interviews."
3,Practical Stats... hah,"If a book is going to teach you the stats you need to do research then maybe you've missed the point of finding out what the people who are reviewing your stuff want. Doesn't matter what is right. Just matters if they agree. Skip this part, learn from someone else, and move on with life."
4,Vera helpful,"My orientador recommended me this book. It hasn't answered all my questions, but it has been helpful in getting me on the right track in medical research. The author uses lots of real examples and his writing flows nicely. I recommend it to any who seek to pursue a career in research or medicine."
1,Hard-core statistics,"I sent this book back at once. This is for the mathematically inclined, full of formulas and such. There is very little 'practical' information, except you consider mathemathical formulas practical information. As a person who does not have time to immerse oneself in the subject that way, I would appreciate a different approach eg. 'if your data looks like this, then use test X and not test Y because it gives you better blablabla...."". You get the idea.It is probably a useful text for those who wish to pursue an MPH or major in statistics. 'Practical statistics for medical research' is in fact not for the physician researcher but for the statistician who is usually on board these days."
4,awesome,"You know what? A lot of warrant fans were sad to see Jani go solo. In 1993, when Jani left warrant, I was excited to hear that he was going to record a solo record, but then, he was back in warrant for 3 more records. Now we finally get that solo album, and i have to say it rocks. A lot of it sounds like the 2 songs put on the warrant covers record face, and subhuman. Awesome grooves, and great lyrics. Its tragic that Jani isn't recognized as one of the better songwriters to come out of the hard rock genre. He truly is underrated, and this album will satisfy those looking for a strongly written, groove record. My favorite is Better than you. Hope that Jani can get a good deal, and put a few more records out. Thank you Jani. Great stuff."
5,Must Have For Any Warrant Fan,"I got this CD from Jani while he played at Rutgers University, on Friday, 2/6. Jani sounded EXACTLY like he did 10 years ago, his voice is still as good as it ever was. I was unsure which way he went with the CD, although he did do some new stuff in the show. I listened to it on the way home that night and I was very pleased. The new stuff is pure Jani, and it is great. I listened to this CD all day Saturday and it just gets better, especially ""Better Than You."" Give it a listen, you will not be disappointed!"
2,"If you were expecting Jabberwocky, this isn't it.","If you were expecting the Jabberwocky CD that is floating around the internet, this isn't it.This album isn't terrible. I was just expecting it to be closer to the Jabberwocky sound. I thought that was the direction Jani was going in.Warrant has always had a habit of disregarding some of their best material for what they think will fit better with the times. Fan's reaction to ""Belly To Belly"" show that this probably isn't the best strategy to use.Hopefully, Jani will release Jabberwocky and Warrant will release some of their old (unreleased) material that fans are currently downloading poor quality samples of.""Newer"" isn't always better."
2,Jani Lane Back Down to One,this cd is not that great at all. when he was with warrant he was actually good maybe I need to listen to cd more to se if I like it
4,Not Bad!,"I had no idea Jani Lane put out a solo CD. I thought I would try this out to see if it would be any good. I actually thought that it wasn't too bad of a cd after all. It had good music and Jani sounded like Jani. If you liked Jani Lane on Warrant, you should give this CD a try."
1,"jani, jani, stinky, stinky, get back in warrant!","jani, jani, jani, what the hell were you thinking!!! your back-up band sucks! every song sounds the same! where's the hits? do what made you famous! uncle toms cabin, heaven, etc! thats where you live! saints of the underground stunk too!!! get back to warrant asap!!! you stink solo, sorry! the magic is you and warrant, the original guys!"
5,Best so far...,"I feel compelled to write this review because I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.I have owed this for around three years now and it is the only one I come back to if I want to do a proper workout. I have lots of exercise DVDs and also have the Just Dance set and Zumba on the Wii but this beats them by far.It is hard work, there are good dance routines which once you remember them they are fun to do (I have no rhythm at all but still manage to bust some moves) and you hurt like mad the next day which, as far as I am concerned, is the only way to know whether you have done enough.You can make up your own routine however short or long you want which tops it off as the perfect exercise regime.My favourite is the boxing section though because that is the only way to get rid of the flabby bits at the back!!!"
4,"A ""must"" for all Reba fans.",Reba is a joy to listen to and even better to watch. You feel the electricity of her live performance. If your VCR is connected to some decent sound equipment you'll experience the thrill of what her live shows must be like.
4,Dr. White,"I gave this book to my six year old daughter as a Christmas gift. We read it together as a bedtime story and her first reaction was : ""I want you to read it again right now!"". In fact, she would have liked me to read it several more times that night. It is a beautifully illustrated, lovingly written story about a special dog who helps sick children get well. It touched each of us emotionally without being falsely sentimental. We both found it very interesting that it is based on true events. I certainly recommend it for children from 3 to 8 and feel older children would also find the story interesting. It is a wonderful book to give as a gift."
4,Megan's Book,"I bought this book for my daughter's summer reading list. It was a truly touching story, beautifully written and illustrated. My daughter loves animals, and to read about one who truly loves people was wonderful. My family really liked this book."
5,Best Book EVER!,"Dr. WhiteI got this book when my son was turning 2, a year ago. At first he looked through the pictures and would listen to me read a little and it has since became his favorite book which he will have me read over and over. I am currently in search of more copies of this book to give to all the children I know. It is the best story ever! I believe that if children hear this story repeatedly throughout their lives then hopefully they will grow up with a kindness to domesticated canines."
5,"Sober, empathetic, and critical examination","Jans has done what few writers (or filmmakers) in the genre have managed: a clear account which eschews an agenda. Read The Grizzly Maze and decide for yourself whether Treadwell was the caricature some have used him for, or a complex human being worthy of a grudging nod of respect in spite of his stubborn unwillingness to contextualize his own 'work'."
5,Riveting,"I just finished reading this book and was riveted throughout. Unlike several other reviewers who found the last third of the book superfluous, I found it highly informative and thought it fit in beautifully with the rest of the story. I appreciated Nick Jans' account of his personal journey with bears and the insights he gained into both his own soul and the behavior of grizzlies/brown bears. I think it is exactly what qualifies him to surmise what motivated Timothy Treadwell to choose the lifestyle he chose. Jans remained objective yet weighed the pros and cons of Timothy's behavior with sensitivity and good sense. He leaves it up to the reader to form his or her own opinions. I saw the documentary ""Grizzly Man"" when it was in theaters - three times. I was fascinated by Tim's story and thought Werner Herzog did a fine job of presenting it. This book and the movie complement each other very well.Jans writes beautifully; I was pleasantly surprised to find a touch of the poet in his prose."
3,Interesting!,"I learned alot about bears.I appreciate his love for the bears,but do not think he went about it correctly."
3,Hmmm...,"I ordered this book (new not used) as a small 'thinking of you' gift for a friend. When it arrived in the mail, the cover was a banged up. It looked like it had been thrown around, stepped on and then tossed in the box. I was disappointed."
3,A collection of articles.,"There is a great story to this man, but this book didn't tell it. It is a collection of articles written about Anderson. Several are interesting and well written. Several are neither."
4,Strongest man ever,If you are really into strength this book is a must read as he was the strongest man ever to walk the earth. Paul Anderson put up weight that the strongest men of today can dream off in an era before steroids and assistance gear. Book is very interesting and has great pictures. Things I did not like about the book was it is an awkward size/shape and it is an accumulation of different stories and different perspectives. It was not one person narrating/telling his life story. Although by the end of it you get the picture of Paul Anderson's life.
2,Not Quality,This product is not the best and should not be installed anywhere. I would return it if I had the packaging.
3,Out Of Reach Switch,"Purchased this switch not knowing that it was not like the one I purchased elsewhere.1) Switch has a loud on/off click2) Switch buzzes when it is being used3) Wall plate is too bulky/thickFor the price of $9 and change, this switch replaced a hard to reach switch located in a corner,it is worth the price. The switch I purchased elsewhere for $20 is much better for a bedroom.Basically, this is a cheap unit and you get what you pay for.Installation was simple, instructions were correct. Works as advertised."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,I feel that no matter what the purchase price of this item is it is not worth it. Amazon should not even sell this item. It quit working after only 1 day of use.!!!!
2,"Poorly designed unit, not worth the price","Unit is too large for the standard box, clunky, and uses a poor performing 9 volt battery. I bought two units and one did not even work. I will be using the skyhome system for my remaining projects"
4,Heath Zenith BL-6133-WH Basic Solutions Wireless Switch and Wall,This is the second HZ wireless switch I have purchased. The first lasted about 15 years in the same location as this new one. This identical replacement works well . . . although the on/off function occasionally take a few seconds to react. I'm surprised that many people apparently do not know that such a product exists because visitors to my home are frequently surprised when told this switch actually activates a hard wired switch in an out-of-the-way location.
2,Has a minimum wattage requirement,"Along with the 500 watt maximum draw this product has a minimum draw as well. I used this in conjunction with a relay to power something with more than 500 watts, the relay coil was about 8 watts. When hooked up this way neither switch does anything and the output is 88 volts, who designed this garbage? While playing with it I noticed the output is not 120volts like the input, it varied from 100-110 volts.I don't know what the minimum wattage is, but here's a scary example, lets say you are replacing a light fixture, you turn the switch off, now you unscrew the bulbs. As soon as you take the last bulb out the power is turned back on without your knowledge. Use the small off switch under the plate if your replacing anything, better yet turn off the power. Better yet don't buy this piece of crap!"
4,Useful,"I bought this about 1.5 year ago for my bedroom. Since then, I do not have to walk to entrance of the room to turn off light when I sleep, I can stay on the bed when turn off light to sleep. Installation was pretty easy, I have no knowledge and skill, just followed the instraction but I could do within an hour.The reason for 4 star is, the first switch installed in the wall shorted almost a year later after installation. I ordered second one and reinstalled several months ago. I do not know the cause of the short, but this is still useful and considering the price, it's a buy."
5,light made easy,I bought this item really thinking it wouldn't work but the price was good so I figured what the heck. Not only does it work but it was easy to install. Woop Woop.
4,Works well with my 2 CFL,"I've installed to control the light for 2 CLF lights, 13 watts each, and it works well. The installation was easy, the remote switch is thicker than pictured but it isn't a big issue (however I've seen others on the market that are thinner). I didn't have any issue to control the lights from about 15 ft away. Quality is OK, not great, both switches don't feel as the same quality as the standard one I replaced, however they work well and, overall, I'm satisfied with the solution they provide."
2,"Beware the ""up to"" distance claim","The wiring was easy, fresh battery in the wall switch... Okay, we're ready to give it a go.... Humm- I should have said NO GO. A mere forty feet between transmitter & receiver, but too much for this weakling. Already returned this disappointment."
4,A little duct tape and voila!,"I originally found that the remote switch didn't operate through garage doors nor to the necessary range when installed as instructed. But after Macgyvering the antenna on the installed switch a bit (pulling it out through a screw hole in the switchbox faceplate and adding a length of speaker wire to extend the antenna length vertically) it worked well enough! The remote switch only works from one location inside the house but it does control the detached garage's exterior light, which is all I wanted."
2,Read Description,This can only be used on incandescent bulbs. I had this installed to control my outside fluorescent floods and when i turned it on the switch started to buzz inside and only two of the three lights came on. When i shut it off one light would not stop flickering and so i removed the switch and am planning on returning it unless i find another use somewhere i don't mind it burning down.
1,Aweful,"I really wanted to like this product. It was exactly what I needed, It gave me another light switch without having to rewire the room. But unfortunately it didn't perform as I expected. The main switch was very flimsy. It doesn't feel like a real light switch. Also, I have a ceiling light with CFLs and whenever the light was ""off"" I would hear a faint buzzing noise. It turned out the lights were still on just very faint. This was unacceptable. Off means off, not very dim. I returned this product and got my money back."
4,Does what it say it does,"I got this and installed it. Beware this is not for ""3 way"" switches. The switch lever is a little chessy but what do you expect for this price. Works well and does what it is advertised to do."
1,Heath Zenith BL-6133,"This is an inferior product. I installed it on an old style tube fluorescent long tube ceiling light. Problem one, when you turned the light off it would glow for about 10 seconds before it would go out. Problem two, you have to fiddle with the remote switch to get it to work and on the slow start fluorescent, that was a big problem. I reinstalled it on another light and it works poorly. The remote switch is the problem, sometime it works and other time you must fiddle with it to get it to turn on or off. I have 4 handy switches of the Billy Mays style and they work get. I wouldn't recommend this swithch."
4,Works well in a small room,"I have this in my dining room and attached kitchen. It has worked flawlessly for a few months now, other reviewers hit on the idiosyncrasies of it. As long as you follow the directions it seems to work fine. I use it for a low-voltage halogen track lighting fixture, no dimming."
4,It didn't work properly... Got it to work after getting replacement switch,"The lights would flicker when they were supposed to be off and also it would not turn on or off the light. I was using this switch to control a ceiling light, the remote switch is only 8 feet away. The quality of this product needs to be upgraded, specially coming Zenith. I believe there is something wrong with the unit and will try to return it and give it another try.UPDATE:I recieved a full replacement from Amazon with no questions, When I installed the new one it started to flicker again.The flicking problem is with using Compact Fluorescent bulbs.This what you need to do for switch to work.If your lamp holds more then one bulb and you are using Compact Fluorescent bulbs. Replace one of the Compact Fluorescent bulb with a regular light bulbs and that should fix the flicking problem.Beside that problem the switch saved me from having to run wires and getting into the attic."
2,Doesn't work very well,The only good thing about this was that it installs easily. The range is supposed to be 100 feet but I have to carry the switch with me like a remote control because sometimes the lights will come on from 90ft sometimes not until 15ft.
1,Very Poor Quality,"This unit showed up with a couple of problems. First, it didn’t work properly. When I used the remote switch to turn off the light the circuit was not completely broken. As such, the lights would flicker when they were supposed to be off. The second problem, and the worst, is build quality. The remote on this made of cheap light plastic. The switch wiggles and wobbles. You must be very precise when switching the remote on and off or nothing happens. I would never recommend this product."
1,Doesn't work at all,"I am very disappointed with this product, it doesn't work at all. I tried it in place of several switches and it doesn't work with any of them with any combination switches flipped. I am amazed that no one else has had this same problem. Needless to say I will be returning this item."
1,"Good idea, but doesn't work well.","This product sounds good, but it doesn't really work well. The remote switch needs to be flipped 2 or 3 times, and sometimes 5 or 7 times to turn the light on or off. I am living with it, but it is not desireable. Also, the cover plate screw holes in the replacement wired switch are not the same size as regular american switches and the screws you have do not fit and may break off. The unit does not come with replacement cover plate screws to compensate for this. Luckily my replacement switch was installed in a dual switch box, so I cut the screw heads off the replacement switch side and glued them in the holes so it looks ok, but again, not desireable."
1,"Worked for a few minutes, then ....pffttt!",Can't comment on reliability as this product worked fine for a few minutes until I actually secured the remote switch into the wall and it ceased to operate. Switched batteries. Didn't help. Unmounted from wall. Didn't work then either. Moved remote switch around the room to make sure there wasn't any interference. Didn't work.
2,remote switches,"I am an electrician, and installed 3 switches for a customer. Switches would turn on remotely but would not turn off. Talked to the manufacture and did all of their ideas to no avail. I would not buy this product or advise anyone to buy this product."
3,Wall Switch & Wireless add-on Switch,"The Heath Zenith BL-6133 works as promised. It switches on from the hardwired main wall switch and from the battery powered wireless remote switch. The switches on both hardwired and wireless will activate on or off with a complete cycle of the switch from on to off, but they will also activate if the switch is only partially cycled up or down and the switch will then return to it's previous location. It does not harm the switch. Other than that, the switches work fine"
4,switch,this works great where you have an old house and need a switch at the bottom of the steps or the top where theres not one.
3,Wireless Switch and Wall Switch,Good temporary solution for moving a switch. Three stars for inability to handle cfl lighting. Will be obsolete when bulb replacement is no longer available.
3,It works,The reason i bought this was to have a two way switch on my steps going downstairs to meet code. This thing makes noise and doesn't work well with CFL bulbs. Only buy it if you have to.
2,broke soon,"I installed this for a seldom used flood light.The radio switch quit working within a few weeks.amazon replaced the switch for me right away.But the new switch has worked erratic already,if it quits again I will wire in a new wired switch ."
4,Works like MFGR says,This is a great way to add a 3 way light switch in a place where wiring the 2nd switch would be difficult. DO NOT try using this with compact fluorescent bulbs. It kills the switch unit. I ordered a 2nd one & set it up with good 'ole incandescent bulbs - Works Perfect!!
2,Light turned on by itself 3 times,"The installation was easy. I used it for a week, everything worked fine, EXCEPT the light it connected to turned on by itself 3 times so far, with no one near to either one of the switch. Not sure whether it is a defective unit, or this product is too sensitive to noise. I'm returning this product and will just install a regular switch instead."
3,Saves you wires...,Saves you from running wires - but like a garage door opener - sometimes you have to switch more than once. You cannot use compact flourescents in them either - screws it up and I had to replace it. Warranty was good though - they replaced the switch no problem...
2,Poor quality and short life,"The feeling of quality is lower than a typical light switch. It just seems loose and ""cheap"". In spite of this, and the fact that the remote switch only worked about 90% of the time, I was reasonably happy with this device for the roughly 6 months that it lasted. On flipping the wall switch one morning, one of the bulbs in the light fixture burned out, and apparently that was too much of a power spike for the electronics in the switch to withstand. It hasn't worked since. I won't be buying another one."
2,Works well... for a while,"I'll probably rewire it to be powered by a 9V mains converter. It seems to have issues when the 9V battery is placed in the compartment (works fine dangling or held, stops working when the battery is moved 1/2 inch into the compartment).In terms of how to improve the product, what I was actually looking for was a switch like this one but which allowed the remote to be mounted in an available existing switch slot, and perhaps even directly powered through a wired connection to the mains power rather than via battery. I realize that the battery powered version is possibly what most people want... but I had a spare slot in a 4-switch bank. But it doesn't fit so the remote is screwed to the wall beside the existing switches. So it's battery powered... for about a week."
1,Two problems with this product.,"I bought this product to put in a ceiling light switch without tearing up a wall to install wiring. I ran into two problems. First, I needed three of them. They used to offer a choice of 5 wireless channels and let you set the channel on each. Now the channel is fixed, there are only two (D and E), and YOU CANNOT SPECIFY THE CHANNEL YOU WANT when you order the product. I can understand lowering costs by eliminating the channel switch, but otherwise, this is just plain dumb.Secondly, one of the units failed after a little over a year. The base unit flaked out. Given the difficulty of ordering one on the channel you want, I'm giving up on this product."
3,Ok but limited,this product will not mount in a standard wall box at the remote end. It must be surface mounted thus sticks out from the wall and looks ugly. You can not take the remote switch out of its case and get it to fit in the regular inset box.
2,An OFF BROADWAY composer!,"I really don't understand the appeal that Adam Guettel has for the recording companies. His music is definitely intricate, music for the learned musician (as most of Sondheim's pieces as well written as they are)! After listening to MYTHS AND HYMNS and FLOYD COLINS, I do realize why neither will ever be a success with the public! It's just too difficult to hear!"
2,Please read,"Before you buy this CD or any musical for that matter, be sure to read the reviews and not necessarily buy it on that account. While the overwhelming majority felt this album was exceptional, it wasn't that ""real"" musical which I love... (I know the term ""real"" is a vague term in itself.) Listen to sound clips too. If I have then I would have saved some money..."
5,Myths and Hyms is beautiful!,I have been researching musicals recently and accidently found this one. The music is beautiful and inspiring. There are not many CDs of Musicals that I play while relaxing ... this one is a first. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a little variety in their library of Musical tunes. And for you Church soloists ... there are some touching solos that could easily be used for Sunday Mass.
4,"""Myths and hymns"" is beautiful and moving -- mostly","I agree with the other reviewers that ""Floyd Collins"" is a genuinely brilliant work, lovely, cerebral AND touching. And so is most of ""Myths and Hymns."" What extraordinary vision Adam Guettel has. I have not noticed, however, that many if not all of the previous reviewers have declined to comment on the Patinkin number, ""Sisyphus,"" which I consider the works sole misfire. It strikes me as more of an experiment, a notion, than a composition. I promise, I've given it multiple listenings and I grow more annoyed each time. Am I not getting it? As a whole, however, I am a salivating fan of Guettel and will purchase anything he creates."
1,Alert! Don't purchase this item!,"Alerts should be put on this product. You can't purchase film for this camera, its been discontinues! Buyer beware!There is film out there but it's all outdated, and the film you can purchase is marked up 500% from what it was, price was $11.oo per pack now it's $57.00 per pack if you can find it and it is expired. The last date that Polaroid manufactured this film was in 2009.Do not buy this product from anyone! Good advise from lessons learned at my expense."
4,wow,"I think it's funny that this is being sold for so much, I have the exact same camera and I got it for 8 dollars at GoodWill. It is a much better/cheaper idea to just try and find a Polaroid at at a thrift shop than buying one online"
4,:),"After months of ""should I order this?"" and ""what about the film?"", yesterday I went into a store and found one! I then walked over to Urban Outfitters and bought the new film. Ok, pretty cool.I had some trouble getting the film in, so it got exposed and the pictures did not turn out so great. By mid-film, they had a neat sephia tint that I actually really love!I will buy more film from the new company, because from what I've read, it probably is my fault, not the film's or camera's. I bought this camera locally, (NOT OF AMAZON), so if there are any problems with it I can return it to the store."
3,"Okay pictures, but...","The first thing I did with this camera was how comfortable taking pictures with it was. I had problems seeing the subject, because it had a very small view so my nose just keep hitting the camera just to get the best view with this thing. That's my reason it's not THAT good of a camera.I saw that more expensive cameras usually takes better pictures. The retailer took two pictures with two different cameras and one seemed darker and less vibrant(guess which one is the more expensive one).Finally, I just don't know why, in Canada, films for these cameras are just too expensive. It cost me two dollars every picture! At that price, I rather buy a SRL camera."
3,Fine camera--dishonest selling points.,"I ordered a Polaroid camera, and it seems to be in working condition, as described, however...it was written that film would be included with the camera, and it certainly was not. I planned on ordering film anyway, but I think it's annoying to be lead to believe something is included with your purchase only to find out you have to spend more money to get what you paid for in the first place."
1,Expensive Film,The film for this camera is incredibly expensive. So it isn't really worth it. It was a quality product and shipped fast. I went ahead and got a refund.
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed with the quality of the product. I did not receive an invoice with the camera. I'm still trying to figure out how to return it. I've sent an email to the vendor expressing my dissatisfaction but I have not received a reply.
1,Not what I order bad advertisement,"So disappointed. The image of the product is not authentic, I received a toy instead of vintage one. Stay away"
1,Watch the region this DVD is for...it may not work in your player.,Was excited to find this concert in the height of his career. This DVD will not play in the eastern United States. This was a waste of money. Ask this question before purchasing.
4,Running with Drums!!,"This bands drummer is the best drummer in rock& roll. I heard he got injured, so here's hoping he gets back behind that kit soon so he can help Runner take over the world. Still go see these guys live. The singer and bassist are still great, and the drummer filling in is an adequete drummer. 4**** album."
2,"Good unit, lousy support","As a previous poster noted, Amana does not acknowledge the existence of these rebadged Haier units on its site. Unfortunately, Haier also does not seem to acknowledge them, making support put-near impossible. The a/c unit does require a small window (or a large one largely blocked off) which can take some work if your windows are not the right size, but that's true of any unit like these. It is a very handy unit, without the need to empty buckets. It is also fairly noisy, with odd controls that require the remote. It was great the first year we had it, less so the second despite careful storage. You'd probably do better with a domestic-production (or European, or Japanese) unit if you can find one."
5,Great AC unit,This unit works great. It is really powerfull and pretty quiet. Comes on wheels so it is easy to move around. Keeps our large rooms cool right through the summer. Note this needs to vent out of a window. No problem for me and I'm really happy with it!
1,not really portable - beware,"This product is advertised as being portable, but it must be attached to a window vent to work. It also won't work with a sliding glass door. So it's not portable. When I called to complain, the customer support supervisor would not give me contact information for higher management. She wanted my name and contact information instead.Buyers should also know that Amana is now owned by Haier, which is owned in part by the government of the People's Republic of China."
2,The Drifter - Joyce Thies,"MR. APRILMan: Jesse Hubbard--irresistible loner and proud part-owner of the Triple L Ranch.Nature: Wild at heart.Philosophy. Never to be tied down to any woman, until he met his provocative new partner.Jesse's longtime partner might have sold his share of the Triple L to his granddaughter, Terry Brubacker, but Jesse had no intention of allowing the luscious city slicker and her two boys to run roughshod over the land he loved. His plan was to buy mother and sons out. But that was before he found himself seduced by Terry's arousing charms. Still, Jesse knew who--and what--he was. And even as the passion exploded between them, he knew he couldn't risk his heart."
5,perfect condition,The book arrived on the day promised and was in perfect condition. I have no complaints. This book is a 2011 edition and is much more expensive in my campus bookstore.
4,A great little photo display frame.,"This is a great little photo display frame. For the size, the display resolution is sufficient, and you can select the time between photo changes. It does require a SD or similar card, for the photo files, but you may have a small one that came with your point-and-shoot, and the small one will work fine. The only problem (and the reason for one less star rating) is that photos that have been ""modified,"" which include those modified in Photoshop in any way, will not play on the photo frame. I had to call the manufacturer, and he helped me ""convert"" the files -- using the Graphic Converter program -- to a more generic (non-Photoshop) JPEG format. It wasn't hard, but it did take some hassle calling the manufacturer and doing the conversion for each of the 150 or so shots. But, now that it's up and running, my wife loves it and so do I!"
5,GIRL POWER IS BACK AND ITS BACK IN ENGLAND FOR GOOD,"I THE SPICE GIRLS ARE BOSS I THINK THEY WERE GOOD WITH GERI BUT THEY ARE EVEN BETTER WITHOUT HER LOTS OF AUSTRAILA PEOPLE SAY ""SPICEGIRLS ARE NOT GOING TO AROUND MUCH LONGER"" AND START SAYING BAD THING ABOUT THEM BUT I THINK THEY ARE SPICE GIRL WANNABE'S. SPICE GIRLS ARE AROUND AND THEY WILL BE AROUND FOR EVER."
5,The spice girls rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The spice girls sound great live or on their number of cd's. I have been a loyal fan for a number of years and I will keep loving them for years to come. SPICE and SPICEWORLD are the best cd's made by the spice girls. They rock!!!!!!!!!Go and check out their cd's.
1,SPICE GIRLS CAN'T SING. COME ON BE ONEST,IF YOU WANT TO HEAR MUSIC THEN LISTEN TO GREEN DAY THEY WILL NEVER BE BEATEN.
1,Ruined my dreams of balled melon.,Complete and utter failure of this melon baller when used with a soft melon. Both scoops broke off before completing a single ball of melon. I had to eat my melon in non-ergonomic cubes.
2,second disatisfaction,"product description never mentioned it being a wooden grip, nor does the picture seem like it. I am dissatisfied because i thought it was some yellow hard material. with a second purchase where the pictures have fooled me, i would like to warn everyone to please choose wisely."
1,Money Wasted,"Hard to say that a book costing $3.75 is a waste of money, but this one is. First off, it is Vol II only and begins on page 273. Opposing pages are in English and Latin, and Latin wins every time. Many of the English language pages are illegible. Amazon should be ashamed of itself for sponsoring such a poor reproduction, no matter how cheap the price."
3,The Gay Man's Rammstein,"Not really, but seriously, this album has a few techno beats which take away from the heavy/light rock songs which in my opinion are the cornerstone of the album."
5,So Gut!,"While not as heavy as I would have liked, there is so much atmosphere to this album it blows you away anyway. I especially love the vocals. Alexx's deep voice is so different from other german bands, and it just sucks you in. i'm not a big fan of electronica/techno or whatever, but i would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially rammstein fans."
5,My Greatest Mistake,"I actually purchased this album by complete accident. For some reason, it appears in the search results for Rammstein and in my shopping spree to own everything Rammstein, I wasn't paying attention and it found itself on my doorstep. However, after listening to it, I was absolutely pleased. While Eisbrecher does not have the ""slightly evil and demented"" lyrics of Rammstein, they do have the deep pounding melodies with the perfect mix of highs, mids and just enough ultra lows that you stay mesmerized by it. If you are an audiophile, you deserve this album and if you have the system, this album will definitely test the structural integrity of your house."
3,Eh,"My first Eisbrecher album was Sünde, and it was/is fantastic. And I really loved ""Mein Blut,"" so I bought this album next. Alas, Eisbrecher fell short. It's not even close to Sünde's quality. I enjoyed listening to Eisbrecher the first few times through, and the songs are way better than most of the stuff on the radio, but it gets old fairly quickly. All those synthesized sounds start to get annoying, and there doesn't seem to be that much there to keep my attention. However, I would like to note that my German isn't very good (awful really), so it could be that the lyrics are really inspired or something."
1,Mostly Fluff and Not Enough Stuff,In a book containing 192 pages only 64 pages are about the Bedlington Terrier. The rest of the book is strictly generic as to the care of dogs in general.There were a lot of pretty colored pictures of Bedlingtons and not much information. There was no information concerning Copper Toxicosis in Bedlingtons or any other genetic problems. No mention of DNA testing or liver biopsies. Nothing said about their great disposition and that they love kids.
2,Not NEARLY as good as the beginning of the series...,"Ok. This book is nice. But what happened here? The Thoroughbred Series started out fantastically. I couldn't wait for the next one to come out. But now, each book gets worse and worse. The Thoroughbred Series barely EVER talks about racing horses anymore; it's just Christina and jumping. And what happended to all the great characters? Samantha dissapeared, Heather, Mandy, Tor, and all those people. I haven't heard about Caroline or Rory for the LONGEST time. Cindy disapeared, and whatever happened to Brad and Lavinia? If anyone knows what happened to all the missing characters, please e-mail me. I really wish that these last few books were more like the first ones."
2,What happened to racing?,I have one question: what happened to the racing? I like eventing but this book was all about racing and I mean the thrill and the speed of Thoroughbreds racing at top speed. What happened to that?
3,Pretty Good,First of all I would like to say a horse can learn to jump in three weeks! I am 12 and own a 2 year old Paint mare named Montana Sky. I have just sterted to jmp her and she is already jumping 2 ft. But anyway I liked this book I thought it was pretty good. Except that Christia ws a complete brat! She should do what was best for her horse not herself!
1,THIS IS CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all I agree with the other reveiwers no horse I mean no horse can learn to jump 3ft in three weeks. In #24 she got on Foster and went from jumping 2ft to 3ft ""6"". No way can she learn to jump 3ft six inches in a couple of days, and why does Christinia(a snotty little bratt) hope that Cassidy will ride her perfect little horse Sterling for her when she said so many mean things to her??? I just don't get it, And she is so jelous of Cassidy because Dylan likes her??? And just because Cassidy's a better rider then her and can keep her horse under control ha ha, she autimmatically hates her??? And I wouldn't be surprised if Dylan likes Cassidy more than Christina. If I were Dylan I sure would like Cassidy more than Christina. PLEASE BOOKS, GET BETTER"
2,My opinion.,"Well i say thoroughbred series aren't the best.I am atlast glad that someone likes show jumping like Christina.But once you keep on reading she sells Sterling and goes back to racing.So yea.My favorite charactor and the best is Melanie.She is really cool.I for one like horses,mystery & fantasy.Horses and mystery is what i like looking for. :DI keep reading these books one book after another and say wait always {mostly} end very simaler as the other books ive read in the series it just keeps going on and on and on! Its CRAZY! Like Nancy Drew for instance its always the SAME! No matter how diffreent it is its the SAME!!! Sometimes it's just plane annoying reading the same thing over and over though its a diffrent series number.I am telling now on earth its very hard to find a good interesting book.The best series i find is Horsefeathers by Dandi MackallThey are the BEST!"
3,The Cover,What i really like admiring is the covers of the series.They are drawn very nicely.I want to draw one day like that.
3,Save Christina and the rest of the Thoroughbred Series!,"The Cindy and second generation eventing portions of the series were dark days for Thoroughbred. The plots have since switched back to racing and the newest few books have been exceptional. Just as we thought there was hope for the Thoroughbred series to be restored to its former glory Harper Collins has decided to end the series abruptly after #72. With such a dedicated following and online fan base with members from all over the world, this is a classic and beloved series that has inspired many people and provided horse fans with vicarious thrills and adventure. Ashleigh saved Wonder, now it's up to you to help save Thoroughbred. [...]"
3,IT IS EXCITING BUT WHAT HAPPENED?,"What happened? Christina used to be so nice to Sterling, but when Sterling didn't behave perfectly, Christina became an absolute brat! And the old characters are gone.....grr! Really, the new authors should study up on the old generation so they can make it accurate. As for Christina's attitude, if she were a little gentler with Sterling...But never mind. If you like jumping, read it, but it isn't that great if you're looking for the old Thoroughbred characters."
3,It was average...,"In ""Sterling's Second Chance,"" Christina's character gets rather err, dumb. She judges Cassidy, who really is a nice person, on the fact that Christina can't get used to the fact that she is a really good rider, at least as good or better than herself. This is probably not a book for a person who likes everything to be hunkey-dorey around Whitebrook."
2,Needs Help,"I've been reading the Thoroughbred Series for a couple of years and I loved them because they were good books that could make me laugh and cry. But now, the characters are too shallow and the plots are pretty stupid and pointless. However, I read the Joanna Campbell is going to write the series from #32 and on and she is also coming out with another series based on Ashleigh in August, so I haven't lost heart. I mean, the books CAN'T get any worse; it's not possible."
3,This book was okay,"This is very strange. 1st, Sterling learnt to jump in three weeks, when Seira (who just disappears like Cindy Sammy Wonder Princess and many more) was a quick learner according to Tor (who also disappeared) and learnt to jump in about 4 months. You don't just not ride for ages then suddenly be able to ride in a show. Trust me, I've been in some, it takes heaps of practise."
2,What's Missing?,"This book was ok, but there are too many spaces. Someone needs to do a Super Edition. Like why is Sammy living in Ireland? Ashleigh was to have a 2nd baby? What happened to Wonder,Glory, Cindy, Wonder's Champion, Pride? Plus they shound not have raised the price!"
3,what happened,"what happened to all those years in between when Cindy was three and now she is suddenly twelve years old.,"
1,What Happend To Sammy and Cindy????????,I read thise seires manily because it was about racing not jumping!!! I think that Joana Campbell should wright the books instead of Etes. The books have gotten a lot shorter since she has takin over the series. Also it is like Samantha and Cindy have fallin of the face of the Earth. If the books dont get better i am going to stop reading the series.
3,This book was okay..........,"I really don't like the part in this about cleaning a horses seath. Where the heck are Mandy and Cindy? JOANAA CAMPBELL DIDN'T WRITE CHIRSTIN'S COURAGE, CAMP SADDLEBROOK, O MELANIE'S LAST RIDE!!!!!!!!!!!! All these books were written by Allison Etes and even though it says Joanna Campbell IT IS WRONG!!! I am referring to the paperback edtion of this book."
3,im selling mine and going back to 35mm,"I've had this camera for about a year. It works really well upclose, most of the times. Alot of the times the pictures come out really blurry, which is why I am selling it. I think it has to do with the auto focus and the flash it uses with each picture. In their next camera, they should have an option to turn the flash on and off, because when you use it, it's hard to get the lighting perfect. If the lighting isn't right, it comes out all smudged and blurry. I think for the price of film for this thing, it should have been made better. It has held up really good and all parts work still in the past year. The only problem is the pictures come out blurry too often."
2,"umm, awkward.","So it clearly says that this product comes with a box of film and a camera bag, so why did I only get the camera and nothing else? I bought it used, but I don't think that should matter if used is being advertised. I'd honestly just really like to get what I paid for. Any answers Amazon?"
3,Beware the Gypsy Curse,"I originally bought The Crone at a ""5 for $2"" sale. I definitely got my money's worth with this one. There is a little trouble with the time scale (a common problem in books and movies), but otherwise it was pretty good and enjoyable.The title character throws a black-magic curse on a travel agent when her daughter commits suicide (it was supposed to be a hoax but wasn't). The curse is in the form of a blob that goes around eating everything and assuming their shape. It then pursues the travel agent across Asia and Africa. The ending is obvious, but still, I enjoyed it. A really good book if you like travel agents."
2,Look elsewhere,"Same caveats as the other reviews point out. Not very comfortable, and your grip slips down the plastic handles easily. Also, the grip uses a little plastic pin to hold the two handles together, and after about 30-40 reps it starts to come loose, essentially easing the resistance.Bought this for the convenience of being able to adjust the resistance, which is useful, but it's just not a good product. Grips are still a good way to go for forearms, though - just look elsewhere."
2,Good at first but then not so much.,It works great at first but after you use it for a few days the rubber ball breaks open because the handle edges cut into it. The edges are sharp and not rounded.
3,Good for beginners,"If you are not all that strong, this is a good product to purchase. You will need to upgrade eventually as I don't think the plastic will withstand too much continual stress. It is working out just fine for me, but I am not all that strong (hence the reason for purchasing this product). It is cheaper than most, and works just fine."
1,Gripper,"I have had one of these for a long while. I dont use i that much because it is very uncomfortable. After numerous reps the grip starts to slide in your hand because of the sweat and unusual shape. Your better off doing chinups with your thumbs ontop of the bar instead of rapped around it. If you want to buy a gripper buy a gripmaster, you can get them on Amazon. They are cheap, durable and come in different strengths. The upside of the Gripmasters is that they work each finger indivually and if you buy the callus tips they will give you a set of thick calluses, great for guitar and banjo players!!! don't buy this!!"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"What an absolute WASTE of money. This DVD does nothing to help the teen driver.It has such gems as telling teens not to drink and drive.WOW, what a great piece of advice, they didnt learn THAT in drivers training.They also say to look left, right and left again when at a stop sign. WOW! I never heard that before.Also, when you drive in fog, turn your lights ON. AMAZING, I never would have thought of that!Hope you get my sarcasim but dont waste your money buying it or your time watching it. I got it from my library so I am not out any money.My 16 year old could have taught this.AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.WISH I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS, because that is what it deserves!"
5,Blues At Their Best,"This is one of the best ""new blues"" album that I have come across in a long time. The music is insistant and real and Pearce's voice is raw yet still gentle. After suffering other actors-turned-singers (Murphy, Johnson, and fellow Aussie Crow) I was almost hesitant to buy the album, but it has been well worth it. I have had the album for two days and it has been in a constant rotation in my stereo. Some might say that because Pearce didn't write the songs that he is not a true artist, but it takes someone with true talent to put as much feeling and soul into the songs as he does. Guy Pearce is a true bluesman in my opinion. This is a must have for anyone who likes the blues, or even if you just want a good slow jam album."
5,"Great lyrics, great music, great songs . . .","I guess the headline says it all . . .I rented this movie from Netflix and found myself watching certain scenes over and over and over again just because the music was so great. I have been a casual fan of Guy Pearce for a while but his singing on this album and in the movie literally blew me away (I am always a little apprehensive when actors fancy themselves as singers-- remember Val Kilmer's terrible singing in ""The Doors""?) But Pearce really gave himself over to the character and that whole-hearted transformation can be heard in these songs which are endearing, inspiring, and sometimes heart-wrenching.With movies trying to increase their gross income with a killer over-the-top soundtrack it was (and is) very easy to dismiss this album, but that would be a tragedy, Guy Pearce does an amazing job here and it should not be missed; the songs are simple, but no less magical."
4,Soundtrack,Great composer this Guy Pierce...great soundtrack....great acting also in the movie. Bought this album after I watched the movie and at the end while running the credits they played another tune... and another .... It kind of grows on you.Go and see the movie. It goes great with the soundtrack.
5,Purchased for a gift.,I bought this as a gift for my cousine who's hard to buy for. He loved it but again it's a second hand review. But then again how can you go wrong with Pavaratti?
2,A very bad recording!,"I regreat purchasing this CD. I bought it because Decca's reputation but the CD is simply horrible. As regards the music selection, I have no complain, but unfortunately quality of the recording is unacceptable. It's a very compressed bright recording. Poor dynamic range and harsh edged sound. I am quite disapponted with this CD."
5,wonderful!!,Just close your eyes and let the amazing voice and music flow over you. The selections are precise and the quality of the recordings are great! Own this one.
5,Ascend,"""Ascend: Releasing the Power of the Human Spirit"" written by Dr. James Catanzaro.....I read this book today and could not put it down. I had to see what was on the next page!! What could I learn on that next page?This is a 'how-to' book. How we can rise or 'ascend' to be better people inwardly and outwardly. It is also motivational-telling us to trust, to be sincere, to empathize and by doing these things we too, can feel the 'scend'.I encourage everyone to read this book. It is quite thin and will not take up much of your time but, it's very thick with lessons on how to release that power of the human spirit. You could learn much....I did.I am proud to claim you as one of our own. Thank you, Dr. Catanzaro.Brenda Williams"
4,"Reach new heights through this ""must"" read","Do you need a lift in your spirits or more harmony in your relationships? If so, Dr. Catanzaro's book, ASCEND, is a ""must"" read! You will receive clear certainty that, with the release of God's spirit within, you can ascend to new heights."
5,AScending to a higher level,"This book reinforced my life's premiss that having a caring attitude enhances one's life. Despite life's peaks and valleys, the closer we feel to God the more our lives ASCEND. The book was offered a refreshing definition for the term ""spirituality.""M. Brooks"
5,Zoom V.92 USb Modem,Works well with Samsung Q1 Ultra Mobile PC for dial up access to the internet. No problems whatsoever
3,Worked okay,"This item worked for me, but as soon as I upgraded to a newer computer, I found that faxing was built in and I no longer needed this. I think today's computers wouldn't need this anymore."
4,Nice Anatomy Model,"My mother bought this for my eight year old for a birthday present because we homeschool and our science this year is human anatomy and physiology. This model is roughly 10"" high and has several removable parts. The model itself seems very sturdy and is colored (I believe that was a complaint with other models) and the pieces fit nicely together and are easily replaced once removed. The stand seems a little flimsy, but does the job. The main complaint I guess I have is that it is just the head and torso. It would be nice to have the extremities, too. It would also be cool if more of the parts were removable and if you could see more of the skeletal system. The kit that she bought is actually a game, as well, even though I didn't see that this was denoted as such. But ours is identical to the one pictured. Ours included playing cards to quiz kids on their knowledge. It was definitely a hit with my kids."
4,What we expected,"Good item for entry level introduction to the inside of the human body (torso). It was pretty much what we expected based on the photos and description. If looking for anything more advanced than the absolute basic, go up in complexity and price."
2,MadCatz Control Pad Pro,"Well, I really wanted to like this controller... but I simply just can't :(What I liked:- Smaller than the MS controller, better form fitting as well... Really feels nice and comfortable- Traditional diamond button layout rather that the angled mess that is on the MS controller- Better d-padWhat I didn't and will probably make me return it:- The buttons are LOUD... and cheap sounding. Definitley a distraction... Uh, everyone in QA not notice this?- The buttons need to be completely pressed to get any action out of them. This causes a lot of missed button presses... TonyHawk 2X is supposed to be pressure sensitive, not with this thing... it's all or nothing and you really have to press them to get it to workSo, my quest for the perfect XBox controller moves on... Here's hoping the Japenese MS controller hits the market sooner than later"
3,Good but not worth It,"The control feels nice in the hands but the buttons are very loud when you press them. I let my friends use it when we play DOA3 that way i know when they are trying to do a combo move.Another thing i don't like is the spacing on the buttons, they are spaced out much further than on the MS version. The button spacing is like that of a playstation controler and then the white/black buttons are far above.The last drawback is that the D-pad is not smooth and round but angled causing thumb soreness after playing for a good while."
1,...,"I have gone thru about 7 of these controllers, i thought maybe it was a bad batch but they all stink. I have broken the analog stick on all of them, they are junk. The only good thing is the lifetime warranty by Mad Catz but who wants to keep returning them every 2 weeks? ..."
1,Two major problems,"When I first bought this controller I loved it. So I went out and bought four of them. Now every one of them is brokethe R trigger on each controller is pressed in and will not popback out. I have never seen the likes of this. I still have my 3do and sega genesis controllers which work fine.Another issue is there seems to be a conflict with this controller and EA's games, especially there sports titles.Sometimes I have to unplug the controller then plug it back in.Or I will get a disc is dirty, unable to read error.When I bought these controllers they were the only option toMicrosoft's big black hunk of junk. No with the new s controllerand all the other options out there, stay clear of these controllers."
2,Don't like...,"I bought this controller for my 10 year old son and he could not use it because the right side control ""stick"" or button is too far in towards the center. His hands are not big enough (and he is 4'11""). Probably only good for adult size guys."
4,The best third party controller,This controller is the best 3rd party youll find for a great price too. The button layout is great and you should buy one.
1,Response? Weak... Working capabilities? Limited...,"I first bought this controller when I was drawn to its small and easy size. When I started using it, there were times where I was very close to taking it out and throwing it. When I play ""Halo"", many times it will not recognize the controller. During gameplay in ""NBA Streets Vol. 2"" it will randomly act as if I hit the start button. This happens when it isn't reading port 1 so its frustrating. Buyers beware..."
1,don't waste your time,"Bought this item and had to return it right out of the box (4) times before i got one that fuctioned correctly, really! The cord twists and kinks easy. The right triger button broke after 6 months, so i am now done w/madcatz."
2,[bad],"The idea was great. Downsize the controller slightly, put the buttons back in to the standard diamond, but keep the black and white buttons up top. Toss in rubber grips and a green color, and this is a great HALO controller. However it was not sturdy enough for ANY FPS (first-person-shooter) nut to deal with, as within three weeks of HALO and Dead To Rights the main trigger (right-hand) stopped pressing in. Bam, there goes [$$]. Maybe I was unlucky, but even though it was my favorite controller hands-down, I refuse to buy another one."
3,Pretty Nice but breaks easily,"I bought the Mad Katz controllers (2) to supplement the stock controller that came with X-Box for Christmas (4 months ago). I got hooked on NHL Hitz ..WAY COOL.. and started using these controllers pretty regularly and broke the right trigger and now the top toggle is loose..now these things should be indestructible, c,mon. I used my original Nintendo circa 1986 for years without a hitch. NICE TO HOLD, BUT TREAT IT GENTLY. IF YOUR A ROUGH GAMER..FORGET IT."
1,Dont spend your money,"This is really the worst controller you can buy, if you want to buy an additional one, then buy a Microsoft official controller, but dont spend your money on Madcatz units. My controller can not stop of vibrating. I visited the Madcatz web site and seems like this is a typical problem in this product, I emailed them and no response, really bad tech-support, finally I called them and now I now that I lost my money."
1,Failed after 1 month.,I bought this item and used it along with a MS Xbox controller. The Mad Catz controller's right joystick failed after one month of use. It will not perform forward movements. Unable to repair. [money] down the drain. Would not buy again.
2,Not worth the money...,"This item felt cheap from the second I got it. The buttons are loud and it feels as if the trigger is about to break. Also the colors are all ruined by the yellow area surrounding the memory card inputs. Its only strong point is the macro key, which helps in games such as Dead or Alive 3. In all I recommend buying the microsoft controller."
3,"Gory, campy fun","I bought this as a ""quick read"" for my commute on the train.This is the bloodiest novel I have read in a long time. Yes, the vampires in this novel are monsters. Not at all sexy. They are one dimensional killing machines who leave a big mess behind them. They are repulsive and they smell like rotting meat.They wipe out ENTIRE SAMLL TOWNS leaving nothing but carnage, body parts and disembodied heads in their wake.Despite all this, they manage to remain just a RUMOR within an unsuspecting public.Ok, Ok,...Just take it as a given that you will need to suspend any sense of logic while reading this, but heck, its a vampire novel! Just don't get too attached to any of the characters, because no one but the protagonist sticks around very long."
3,Interesting but Grim,"If you are in the mood for a fairly well written book and can handle a very gritty/grim tone then give this one a try. Let's just say the main character goes through some serious stuff as he comes to grips with what is happening. For me a little too grim. Again, interesting in spite of this . . ."
3,Graphic but disjointed at times,"This book is good; not great, not bad. The graphic descriptions are some of the best in current horror literature. The problem is in practicality and fluidity of the story. There is a saying, ""freedom within form."" A story should provide a plausible context for the reader to enter, even if fiction. Unfortunately this one doesn't at times, which is enough to keep the reader aware that s/he is reading a fictional story. Fiction doesn't equal unbelievable, which this book is at times. I won't elaborate in detail as I do not want to spoil it for other readers. In summary, I recommend the book for a quick and dirty read. Cheers."
1,Boring,"The Authors seem to think readers are pretty dumb. Constantly reiterating how Adams world view will crumble if he believes in vampires, but he seems to come around pretty fast. And then we're treated to a description of a woman cooking her dinner, step by step. The boiling of water, the shredding of lettuce. Economy of words people, you don't need to say ""She plugged in the phrase, clicked on SUBMIT, and waited."" you can just say she googled it. I don't think I'll even be able to finish reading this :/"
5,Simply must read,"I borrowed this book from a friend and loved it immediately. I then went on to buy all the books in the series and I re-read them regularly. It is the story of one man who gathers a group together to overthrow a vicous, uncaring government and to do it without involving huge numbers of troops an unecessary killing. As Pen says once"" A man who can break eggs while smiling"" is needed to bring hope and stability to the galaxy. I would love to see these books as a miniseries - a movie could not do the scope of the work justice."
5,Nice gem of a book.,I happened on this book in the used bookstore one day just looking for something sci-fi and not more than 200 pages. This is what I found and I was totally satisfied!! The story is engrossing and the main character very likeable. I've now found out that the story continues and I'll probably track these books down too.NOTE: Though it is not much there is some VERY adult content in this book. Be forewarned if you or the person you are giving this book to has any objections along reading such things.
5,Books on my shelf come and go but...,The entire trilogy that starts with The Man Who Never Missed has a permanent place there. I just wish that Spaedstot projectors were real. Loaded with the right substance they would be perfect for home defense.
3,I AM A STRAIGHT FEMALE JUST OBSERVING THIS COMMUNITY.,I HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK JUST THE BASIC COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT THE AUTHOR STATED. I REALLY CAN'T RATE ANY OF THESE BOOKS.
1,Documentary,"There is no music on this CD. The whole documentary is also completely on track #1 making it impossible to stop in the middle without having to start at the beginning. The documentary is intersting and the little book that comes along with it is nice, but if you're looking for music, keep on looking."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM BEFORE YOU READ THIS:,"STAR PROFILE is only for extremely-hard-core No Doubt fans. This album does not have any songs on it...no singles...nothing! What it is (which Amazon.com is not advertising as) is a DOCUMENTARY audio CD. Although there are no songs, there is a small picture book and a documentary CD about the band, but no songs...a huge rip-off (especially knowing that amazon.com does not advertise it as a documentary CD)."
1,unsatified,"I rate this item a zero, since I have yet to recieve it. I ordered this with four other posters for an 80s party and this was the only one I did not recieve. It was the one I most wanted. I love the movie. That was over three weeks ago. What is an 80s party without the breakfast club? I am very upset about this. Did I mention that I was charged for it as well?"
1,Amazon.com RIP-OFF!,"THIS BAD REVIEW IS ABOUT AMAZON.COM, NOT HEATH SUET CAKES. Amazon makes you think you are ordering one case of 12 Heath suet cakes for a list price of $25.32, at the Amazon.com price of $9.96 (a ""savings"" of 61%). What you actually get is ONE SINGLE SUET CAKE for $9.96. When I received my one suet cake, I contacted Amazon.com about the missing 11 suet cakes. They replied, ""we're unable to send individual items from a set. We'll send you a replacement order for the entire set."" Then they sent me ANOTHER SINGLE SUET CAKE, not a case of 12. I sent another email to Amazon.com about the second problem, but they never replied. I am now trying to get a refund from my credit card company for $8.30 for the 10 out of 12 suet cakes that Amazon.com never shipped to me. DO NOT ORDER THIS CASE OF SUET CAKES because you won't get a case, you'll only get one cake worth less than $2.00 (or two cakes if you're lucky I guess)."
1,Should have believed the other reviewer,"Yep. Same thing. Ordered 3 cases for $36 and got 3 cakes instead! Took two calls to get them to send more, and they again sent just 3 cakes! Now we had six cakes for $36! But now because we complained twice we were automatically kicked out of their system. They refunded our money but wouldn't send the additional suet. What is wrong with this company????"
2,For all the Oz Collectors...,"These plastic ""Ruby Slippers"" are not too festive,although they will appeal to Oz Collectors...They just forgot to put enough sparkle in them,to make them look like the movie shoes! Howmuch can glitter cost? Really!"
5,Looking forward to my nest issue.,Lots of great reading. I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to discover this magazine. I'm sure I'll be a subscriber for a long time.
3,Nice but over priced!,"To tell you the truth, this is a nice light movie. It tells a story of a Tycoon daughter (she has a deformed face) who was manipulated by a horse trainer. This horse trainer becomes her husband and destorys her... I do not want to ruin the story. But it all revolves around REVENGE.The actress is the one from the comedy ""Wings"". She did a good job in this film.It is nice to watch it once, but it is not so special to be bought and kept in a library... especially for $!!!"
3,Reasonable mystery but better in book than tape,"The heroine is a bit of a psycho case and dealing with long discursive commentaries on the thoughts running through her head meant I could only listen to the tape in small doses. The plot isn't bad and the ending certainly has a punch. My recommendation is to pick up the book and then skip the sections that go on forever. You can fast forward the tape (which I did) but that increases the cost per minute of listening to an unacceptable value equation. Ms. Fielding does do a reasonable job reading her own work, but it's not enough to make up for those interminable run-on passages"
5,Taking surf music into the modern era,"The Surf Mosters CD does a great job of giving light to a growing interest in a once forgotten music. This CD does a great job of dragging surf music into the modern era, preparing it for the 21st century. It also uses classic surf artists to show where its been, and modern artist that give a fesh and new look at were its goin'. Surf music is in good hands. Highlights include Bomboras and Satans Pilgrims track and the Cocktail Preachers track. Smokin' guitar on that track, equipped with bouncy whammy bar. Well worth the money."
4,KRYPT KICKIN' A GO GO,"THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS ON THE COVER OF THE CD. THIS IS A COMPILATION OF BOTH OLD (DAVE MYERS, THE IMPACTS, THE LIVELY ONES,CENTURIONS, ETC)AND NEWER SURF MUSIC (MAN OR ASTROMAN?, SATAN'S PILGRIMS, BOMBORAS, SOACE COSSACKS, AND OTHERS). IT'S A GREAT CD, LOTS OF GREAT GUITAR RIFFS, SURF BEATS, AND OCEAN SOUNDS. YOU WILL DEFINITELY LIKE, IT HAS A NICE CONTRAST BETWEEN OLD AND NEW."
5,Fantastic capture of sounds of surf!,This disc is pure listening pleasure as one track after the other presents surf bands with extreme talent. I can't get enough of Albatross Joe by the Cocktail Preachers
5,Best wipes ever..but you can get them much cheaper anywhere else,"I love these wipes..that's why I gave it the five review. My baby has very sensitive skin; we could only use cloths with water to wipe her and that was a bit trying since we didn't want to shock her with cold water-so each time she needed a wipe, we had to wait by the sink for the water to warm. Even tho I am very diligent about changing diapers and keeping baby dry, she developed a horrid diaper rash when I tried switching to cloth diapers (go figure).Between covering her tush in the regular Lansinoh BF cream (got this advice off the mothering board) and using these wipes, a horrific rash cleared up totally in around a day and a half. Since I started using the cloths, I haven't even seen a hint of redness or irritation at all. One thing to note: after buying them from here, I started searching and discovered that everyone else sells them for 3.50 to 4 dollars a pack. I love these wipes but will buy them elsewhere from now on."
4,Compelling!,"I won't give a summary of the book, since that has been done, but suffice to say I found Miscione's portrayal of the chaos in Albania as well as the trafficking of women and girls into sexual slavery realistic and compelling. Distractors were the author's penchant for dropping brand-names throughout the book and the fact that Lydia's boyfriend willingly follows along, even when she places them into dangerous situations. And he should know better - he's a former FBI agent. But all in all, this is a good book and shows the author has done her research well."
4,The Lydia and Jeffrey partnership continues.,The second book in the Lydia Strong series has you turning the pages at a rapid rate. If you're a Lisa Unger fan you won't be disappointed.
2,Lisa jumps the shark,"I quite enjoyed the first Lydia Strong novel, Angel Fire, which had an interesting plot, fairly good character development (very few weaknesses), and which flowed nicely. The world she created was mainly believable -- something missing in too many novels.This one, not so much.Others have discussed the plot and whatnot enough, so I won't repeat. In the plot, I found there to be too many connections that were not credible. What got me, finally, was the existence of some vast conspiracy of a few unknown people basically controlling the world -- but each identified by wearing a ring with a distinctive symbol.Based upon the first of the series, I'll probably go ahead and read the third book, but it's no longer high on my priority list."
4,A Riddle Wrapped in a Mystery,"Looking for some light reading? Move on. Looking for a novel that is thought-provoking, ""in-your-face"" and sometimes downright disturbing? Look no more. Mike DePaoli's first published work is a dark, disconcerting look at ourselves and our society. The book blends historically piercing commentaries with deeply introspective insights, providing the reader with a glimpse of a world most of us choose not to see. It's a world of dashed hopes and dreams, hypocrisy, malicious government, and injustice, sprinkled with a little love (or a least lust) to keep things interesting. You'll find strong opinions on most any subject, many of which you might disagree with. But you'll be compelled to read on. In the end you will love the author or hate him, but you won't be bored with his first effort."
3,Disappointing Kindle Version,"I'm enjoying the Betty Neels books right now. However, this book had poor editing in the Kindle version, especially the second half. For instance, the word ""marry"" was typed up as ""many"" several times. Other sentences made no sense at all with their typos. For me, it kind of ruined the romantic mood of the book. I was able to return the book for a refund."
1,Poor,"This book should be avoided for anyone looking for a good primer or companion book to Dante. The poem may have inspired the author to publish her own experiences and revelations of Dante's Comedy, but this book will not inspire you to step into Dante's world. I suggest as a good primer the short biography put out by Penguin, and to read the translator's introduction and notes before opening up to Canto 1."
4,good,"satisfied, good product with exactly 100 spikes. met my expectation. though no container to put in. quality is excellent and packaging is alright."
4,Recomendacion,es lo que buscaba muy bueno son de material muy resistentes vale la pena colocarlos en los zapatos lo recominedo
2,Different dimensions.,Friends of different sizes. Some of the key does not fit. It turns out the nail before you know it. They do not realize how this error!
2,Bit off more than he can chew?,"Mr. Mendelsohn sure does have an ambitious idea in this book, but it didn't succeed for me. If all the ideas he put forth were as deeply explored as his treatment of classical literature motifs at the beginning of the book, I would have loved it. It also would have been 3 times longer. As written, I find his ambition overshoots his action, and found this book more frustrating than anything else."
1,Awfully self-indulgent and narcisisstic...,"If you're a navel gazing, self-obsessed posey aesthete who praises himself under the umbrealla of supposed 'self-exploration' then maybe this book is for you... a really egregious book. Shouldn't have been written. Or at least published...."
1,Chelsea Queenery to the Max,"Mendelsohn tells us about his ""immaculate apartment"", the ""perfect parties"" he gives and what ""all my Chelsea friends think"". I can't stand to be in the same room with self-absorbed people like this and found all the navel-gazing unintentionally hilarious. This material belongs in the ""Styles"" section of the Sunday New York Times."
5,EXTRAORDINARY EXPLORATION OF HUMANITY,"This is one of the richest and most intelligent explorations of the human condition--not the GAY condition, mind you, but the human condition--I've come across. I was dazzled by the way the author used his own experience to comment on the conflicts and contradictions all of us must face--pleasure vs. responsiblity, family vs. self, and so on. The language is amazingly poetic without being phony or pretentious, and I found the way the author uses Greek myths to illuminate present-day concerns to be utterly fascinating. A MUST for all readers, gay or straight. All you need to be to appreciate this masterwork is a thinking human being who's open to great writing--and thinking."
3,Not too diverse.,"If you want to know the very basics of building a straight simple stair case this book is ok. But if you want different ideas on staircase design, trimming, railing, etc. don't buy this one. I'm still looking for a good book w/ ideas about railing, trimming an open staircase, alternate ways to build skirts, etc. This book explains very well one (complicated)method for stair case design and construction and then offers 1 page on design alternatives."
3,Would suggest more complete book,"Book covers basics well including triming an open stair case. However, it does not include triming details for closed stringers"
2,very confusing,The book is good if you have some knowledge about carpentry and stairframing but if you like me just starting out you will be confused. I learned way more from the teacher than the book and classmates.
2,Basic Stair Building,"This book is for professional carpenters. As much as we homeowners like to think we can do it all, we can not. Besides, these days we can just buy pre-built steps custom made to your measurements for a fraction of the cost of building them yourself. You don't waste any project time screwing it up either."
5,Thin Air,"The author, Betty Nordberg, does great job of working in real places in the NW and it makes the story morerealistic. An ""everyday-go-to-work"" situation that turns into tragedy and lots of suspense."
5,impressive!,"i got this box set about a week ago, and i am extremely satisfied with the set. the layout of everything is really professional. i was torn between getting the box set or ordering each cd induvidually, but i knewe this is going to be hard to come by, so i had to go for it. also own satanica and demigod, but the music behemoth put out back then was a little more black metal. for one reason or another, i like their older stuff better. very epic. Sventevith is the best in the box set. my personal favorite, at least. the exclusive live cd was supprisingly good. not great, but just good.i was expecting it to be something to sell you on, but i was pleasantly suprisedso in conclusion, if your buying this box set soully for the live cd, don't waste your money. definately worth the money otherwise. the production isn't that great, but that's what you have to expect. the production kind of makes the cd's what they are."
3,Good Stuff,"I have liked Behemoth for awhile now and was suprised by the release of a box set with their first four albums in it. I like the layout of the boxset but the grammer needs work. Many misspelled words. I recommend that any fan of Behemoth buy this album, especially if you like Black Metal. The reason I gave the album only 3 stars is because, from what I found out afterwards, that this album is UNOFFICIAL. Thats right, the band have asked people not to buy this album for they don't profit from it. Their former Polish label had the rights and decided to cash in. So remember that when you are buying this album you aren't helping the band but a greedy label exploiting a band for a few dollars, or Euro's. Other than that, it is a good box set."
1,Not a review,Hey just so everyone knows. This is considered a bootleg by the band. It was released by Metal Mind Productions without permission of Behemoth. The band will have nothing to do with it and has no part in it's release. Just thought that may sway some people towards getting the cds instead of feeding some greedy little record companies attempt at a quick buck.
4,"Very good history, only account of Schlesingers term around.","You should really enjoy reading about Cabinet history before trying this book, but if you do, you won't be disappointed. This isn't a complete history of the Secretary of Defense (look at the DOD Web page for an excellent summary) but rather a look at the highlights. The best part, in my opinion, was the chapter dealing with James Schlesinger's term in office. Validates my opinion that he was one of the most under-rated and best Secretaries the government has ever seen and is the only real account of his stay in office that I can find. You'll get bogged down in budget detail (a necessity for any Pentagon chief to consider) but the historical perspective that Kinnard gives more than makes up for it. Good Cabinet history."
5,Stylin' slacks...,Purchased these for use as part of my son's Halloween costume and they were perfect. (He was Hawkeye from the Avengers.) Now he wears them as semi dressy slacks. They are nicely constructed and will not disappoint!
3,Decent buy but beware: these pants run small!,"These BDU's are just like the real thing, but they have a zipper instead of a button-fly. The biggest issue is THEY RUN SMALL, especially in the seat. I was hoping my son would get more than one season's use out of them when we bought them for his Halloween costume, but that's not going to happen. I'd recommend buying a size bigger than you normally do."
2,You've got to be kidding me,"Black metal with a touch of industrial influences? There is no black metal in this album, other than the creators of it. By far the worst Thyrane album. The Spirit of Rebellion and Symphonies of Infernality rape this garbage."
5,amazing,"This is a great album if you enjoy black metal with industial and epic touches. This album reminds me of Kreator's Endorama, but much tighter."
3,"Informative, yet easy for the non-science person to grasp.","This book provides a very good over-view of the benefits of Chlorella as a nutritional supplement. The authors, a pharmacist and a doctor, have written a well documented summary on the health and healing effects of Chlorella that is both informative yet easy enough for us non-science majors and minors to read and understand. On the downside, the book was written in 1987. I'm sure that further research is now available. I'd love to see un update."
1,Got defective piece,"I received a defective piece. One of the connector (out of three connectors for component cable, has come out immediately after I put in my component cable in it. Asked seller for a replacement piece. Still waiting for reply."
4,HDMI/Component Wall Plate,Unique item having both HDMI and component video receptacles on the same wall plate. HDMI is a feed through (female/female) and component connectors are RCA gold plated female/female. Good construction but not available in other than plain white wall plate.
1,HDMI is not securely fastened to plastic,"I needed an hdmi and component plate which is why I bought this. When I received it, I put it on and the hdmi piece busted immediately. I then ordered a second one thinking it was just weak. Second one did the same thing when I hooked up the hdmi. I wont buy from this piece again from this company. You get what you pay for I guess since it was so cheap."
3,Okay as a textbook....,"I was given the opportunity to read this book as part of a class that I was taking for my master's program. The first few chapters are pretty good, but after that I found that I disagreed with the author more than anything else. I found that I was frustrated because it didn't seem practical for use in a real classroom."
4,Music Producer Software,"Amazon delivered my product before the expected time of arrival, which freed me up to accomplish other errands I had to take care of. I was very pleased with the service I received, as well as the condition of the item I order. I would recommend to others to used Amazon services for product that are hard to find, and to get the best for their money."
3,Out of Date,An OK Software except you cannot register it because the company that made it seems to be shut down. It's all right if you want a cheap MIDI software for only 29 days.
5,awesome :),"Great stuff for people that can't read music, but want to enjoy musical composition. The piano roll feature allows you to do exactly this! Unlike other more expensive midi softwares available, that snobbishly assume everyone is musically literate, Voyetra is written for all the rest of us that didn't have time to, or couldn't afford to, go to music school."
1,WARNING: SPYWARE,"""System Requirements: Internet Access""The included software is spyware / 30 day shareware even though you paid for it. Very irritating multi pop-up messages that demand access to the internet. They are time consuming to dismiss."
1,Worked for one hour,"Installed easily, but the Windows non-compatibility worried me. It worked fine for an hour, then I got stray continuous notes every time I started to record. The software is also not very user-friendly. After going to their web page I've decided to return this. Sounds like many people have are having problems."
1,Didn't work on my Windows XP system,"I'd like to be able to say more about this product but I'vebeen unable to get the included MIDI cable working with myToshiba XP system. I've exchanged about 10 emails with theirsupport person, but so far still no luck. He insists that theyhave tested it successfully with other XP installations, but since they can't tell me why it doesn't work with mine, I'd be concerned that it may not work with yours."
2,Misleading Description of Software,"From Turtle Beach Support: ""All Voyetra Software has been discontinued and the Registration Servers have been shut down, for Copyright and Royalty reasons, therefor no new licenses may be purchased or issued."" -- [...]The product description should include a similar notice. The cable is worth the price, but this portion: ""Turn your PC or laptop into a MIDI Music Recording StudioRecord Producer MIDI Edition software lets you record edit and play music with your MIDI keyboard and you don't have to know how to read music. Record one track at a time from your keyboard to create lush orchestration with different instrument sounds. You can even print sheet music!"" does not mention that said software cannot be activated."
2,can't edit the music score,"PROs: Comes with a good USB-to-midi cable and the basic drivers. You can record from you midi instrument (keyboard, etc) and playback through the instrument OK, and you can see and edit the midi info.CONs: The software is not very intuitive and I frequently find the user interface very frustrating. Although you can generate a score, you can't edit it directly - you can't edit the notation, add lyrics, or make adjustments of any kind.RECOMMENDATION: Buy the Yamaha UX16 USB-midi cable and one of the basic music notation programs like Finale PrintMusic or Cakewalk MusicCreator."
3,Good for the price,This book is great for the price but really gives short shrift to the cat anatomy. The pictures and descriptions would be much more helpful if it emphasized more of the cat anatomy.
2,"no color, not enough details, horrible index","This book didn't have enough detail, I ended up using a bigger color version that my school provided for free."
4,Great book for a great price,This book is great for those taking or teaching a class that uses cat dissection. This book does an excellent job of comparing and contrasting human and cat structures. The only problem is that it doesn't include every muscle in the cat and the human.
5,A gratifying entree...,"As with my reviews of other little books in this valuable series, I will use the descriptors fascinating and authoritative. For the interested layman, a perfect introduction to ancient Greek inscriptions. This entire series is recommended without reservation!"
2,book just adequate,"Both authors apparently have considerable experience in oracle and rman. The book appears to have been put together very quickly perhaps too quickly. Much of the serious work done with oracle is done on unix platforms but almost all of the examples shown are done on windows.The rman in the workplace chapter is perhaps one of the most contrived. While the authors probably have real workplace experience the case studies do not seem to demonstrate more than ""possible scenarios"".There are not a lot of rman books out there so this book may be useful to many people but it seems like this is a very unfinished piece of work to me. It does provide a different set of words than the oracle manuals."
5,Wow!,"Im only on page 56 so far, yet I have no doubt that this book tells me everything that I want to know about RMAN. All I can say is that if you have any doubts about RMAN, read this book.Ive come back to continue my review: Ive now finished the book.OK, my opinion has not changed since page 56, this book has absolutely everything, Robert/Mathew have got you covered.... completely!You can also get replies to your emails, the address is in the book and your emails are answered.Yes, I agree with other reviewers, what a gem this book is."
4,"Good Stuff, Piece of Art","I read this book when I was working on my OCP 9i track in 2004. At that time I needed more information about Backup and Recovery and especially Recovery Manager (RMAN)and I ended up borrowing this book from the library. I then put my exam study guide aside and finish this book. The book is really good. The part that I like the most is the book gives you scenarios that are easy to understand and it shows RMAN in different environment interacting with other storage media. I will definitely recommend this book. A book like this one does not come along very often. I am planning to buy my own copy soon. Great Job RG I give 4 stars.Update: November 5, 2006This the best book on oracle B & R. Since I had my own copy I really enjoy the book especially the RMAN workshop. I am looking forward to the upcoming 10g version of this book."
4,Great gift for a girl named Annika,"Our daughter, Annika, was thrilled to find this book under the tree last year. The story is light, and a bit sentimental, but well told, and the illustrations are so very Swedish...this is a fine tale of giving for Christmas. Of course, now Annika suggests we need to have a traditional Swedish Christmas pudding, with almond, and a wish for a pony..."
2,Holes above threads,"I thought the quality of the product was poor. When the arm was hooked up and turned the water on, there was water spraying everywhere. There were actually holes above the threads on each end of the shower arm. I could not use this item and had to return it."
3,12 inch shower arm,"For the price, I really can't complain much. It is cheap and cheaply made with thin wall tubing. Need to make sure not to over torque otherwise it will twist. The threads are not cut deep enough to promote a lot of confidence. Nevertheless, I am buying a 15 inch arm because I need a longer one. Just can't see myself spending $140 for a Hansgrohe or Grohe or other name brand for a shower arm."
5,I wish I had discovered Pilates earlier in life.,"I have purchased a number of abs dvd's and this one is now my favorite. There are two different exercises, each which lasts for 20 minutes. One is for flattening and the other is for toning. I am a man and I use this. She has an excellent pacing voice in teaching the classes. There are 3 women of different levels so don't be intimidated. Even more, when you look at her, she looks really fabulous for someone who is clearly dare I say 40+"
3,SUPER hard!,"If you have never done Pilates before, BEWARE! This DVD is SUPER hard! I could barely get through most of the exercises.I may try it again soon, now that I've been going to the gym and have strengthned my core a bit through BodyPump and Yoga Fusion, but if you don't have strong abs to begin with you are in for it!Good luck!"
5,Innovative ab exercises...A great core workout!!,"I have tried a variety of abdominal workouts over the years past, however, Mari Windsor's Pilates Ab workout is by far--the best. I never thought I would find an ab workout that I would like better than Tony Horton's ab workout (featured on his 10-minute Trainer series) but I actually did like Mari Windsor's ab routine the best!! She has very unique exercises featured in this ""Pilates Abs"" video - which I did not expect!! I don't have this dvd...But I have digital cable t.v., and on the ""Health on Demand"" channel, I saw her ""Pilates Abs"" workout listed...and I tried it. I highly recommend this workout because it targets all the ab/core muscles."
3,Buena ambientación histórica,"Una curiosa aproximación al movimiento religioso cátaro que se extendió tímidamente por la europa del s.XIII. Expone sin remilgos la dureza de la represión religiosa llevada a cabo por el papa Inocencio. He sentido que, desde entonces, la represión religiosa no ha cambiado sino de confesión, pero sigue ejerciéndose con idéntica brutalidad.Lo mejor del libro la buena ambientación histórica acompañada de una bien tejida historia de amor.Lo peor... lo inverosímil del desenlace. Con todo, me ha gustado y recomiendo su lectura."
1,sculpting good-hated cardio,"I guess I'm in the minority of people who disliked this dvd.First off,let me say that I hate grapevines and when this dvd started with them I thought,UGH!!!!!!!!!!The sculpting was good but I disliked the cardio-mainly because I just despise those grapevines!"
4,Working out with a champion,"This is a good workout and you can't help but enjoy exercising with someone of such grace, poise, and skill as Kristi. It is nice to have Erin O'Brien acting as the teacher with Kristi as the student. Excellent cardio and easy to do in a small space."
4,good interpretation,"Good book, and I like it as Spain didn't fought in WW II but only for a thin lucky line, as Spain fought his own immediately anterior war.This said, I only have an objection, and is I at less think the author resembles writers about Stock Market or Economics: all them explains very well why the things happened in a way or another... but only after the facts have ended, not before. Was Overy with Churchill, Stalin, Roosevelt or Hitler counselling them? I'm afraid not. So these class of books have merit, work and wide documentation, and I don't deny the author may have got right in some facts, but also he can have committed mistakes from appreciation in so complex and huge theme as is explaining why WW II, a war by nothing comparable with wars of the past, was won or lost."
2,nothing new here,"This is mostly a restatement of known facts. The thesis is strained: author states that the overwhelming materiel superiority was not the reason that the allies won, then produces pages on how the allies were superior in materiel. Huh? If the timing of that superiority was off, then that should have been the focus of the arguments.Occasional horrendous errors (plutonium-producing reactor cooled with liquid helium) are also irritating. Readable, however."
5,Need a good start to the day???,This book is for you! the prayers he writes seem to really help you start your day...It's just what you need in the morning...this book is Christ-centered and I love it!
5,Blessed Every Day,"Received this book a few years ago and have since given it many times. Daily it speaks to my mind, heart and soul and gives me encouragement and direction. You will be blessed, if you read it daily!"
2,Price Increase!,This book was under $7.00 just a month ago (November 2011) and the price has jumped $3.00 just in time for the holidays. What a shame as I wanted to order 7 of these for friends. Its a wonderful book (two stars because of hike in price) but we will not support this kind of increase. Particularly during these economic times.......Don't feed the greed. Wait for the price to come back down.
1,My Kind of Garbage!!,This is by far the worst CD Amber has put out. The album has poor quality and the songs are not dance oriented. They are all bad pop ballads. This album has nothing upbeat. Its VERY BORING. Don't waste your money. Amber has gone silly pop and away from her once fun dance sounds.
2,NO MORE AMBER!,Horriable that she switched to??? R&B?..Have no idea but it sucks! Go back to Techno Amber Otherwise retire! Blah...
4,GREAT CD,I DONT CARE THAT AMBER'S NEW ALBUM IS NOT DANCE ORIENTED--THAT'S WHAT REMIXES ARE FOR. THERE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL SONGS HERE. AND AMBER'S VOCALS HAVE NEVER SOUNDED BETTER.
2,Like a Walt Disney film directed by Andy Sidaris.,"All very silly and naive, but as leering *in tone* as just about anything you'll find. The movie opens on a close-up of a girl's navel, and soon a group of boys are singing a song about girls' measurements. It continues downward (?) from there. There are much better Beach Party movies than this recycled patchwork of earlier and superior songs, characters, situations and chases.IMHO, ""How to Stuff..."" needed more Buster Keaton and Bobbi Shaw. An appearance by Susan Hart wouldn't exactly have felt like a sharp stick in the eye, either."
1,How the mighty have fallen,"There's no greater indication of how Hollywood squanders its own talents once they cease fitting the right demographic than to watch Buster Keaton in this sorry spectacle. (No, don't even watch. Just knowing he's in a 1960s beach musical says it all.)"
3,Read it out loud...,"To your kids or something. I don't know who finds this scary, though the poetry's fun. Ehh, instead of reading this, just watch the Simpson's episode. You'll get the benefit of having heard the whole poem, and the episode is cool."
2,200 Gram Chrome,It is a tad over 200 grams on multiple scales. It came all dinged up and scratched. Didn't buy for the looks but I payed for a NEW calibration weight. 2 stars for being 200 grams.
4,Getting to know Wagner,"Although I am not a BIG Wagner fan, I am enjoying getting to know him with this CD. The Dutchman Overture was what I was specifically looking for and it is done beautifully here."
5,Wagner the way Wagner should be played.,"An excellent recording! The power, intensity and emotion never stops. This is Soltis' music and the Vienna Phil. know how to play it for him."
5,Metallica is the best and always will be the best(M.Terry),Metallica is #1 and so is every cd thay have and this on
4,Excellent,"This thing could stape nails if you could fit them. Easily goes though 50 sheets of paper like butter. Just use the right size staples, according to the graph on the unit, and you will be fine."
3,Heavy duty stapler no. 5,"Having needed 60+ page capacity staplers for more than a few years, I'm still on a quest to find a reliable one. There is one that I brought back from Japan. It's been completely trouble free for over ten years but there are no more staples. This one is o.k. I've used this model or one similar to it at work before. It tended to jam and I still have the same problem with the one I bought. The staple mechanism is sensitive and a steady surface on which to staple is necessary."
5,Fantastic Stapler,"I was a bit apprehensive ordering this heavy duty stapler, but most of the reviews were favorable. After receiving it and using a month or so, I have to give it five stars. It is even better than the one we have at work. I ordered several different sized staples for different thicknesses and even the 1/2"" staple do a wonderful job with ease. I would recommend this for any business or home office."
5,Works perfect and better price,Stapler works fine and paid good price for it.. Name brand stores asked too much for it..Very good product and really fits all different size of pins in it.
1,stapler,This stapler jammed continuously and I returned it along with the staples. I kept trying on an old report and I probably got 1 good staple out of 3.
1,"Maybe I'm an idiot, everyone else seems to like this stapler.","Described as able to staple up to 160 sheets of paper. I rarely ever need that, but I frequently need to staple as many as 50 sheets. I attempted roughly 15 times and all of the staples bent. Yes I was using heavy duty high capacity staples - 3/8"" staples brand."
5,MUST HAVE,"FOR HEAVY DUTY STAPLING, THIS PRODUCT ISPERFECT WITH THE S.F. 13 HEAVY DUTY STAPLES.GOES THROUGH LAMINATED CARD STOCK ANDPAINT STICKS..."
4,Perfect for what I needed.,It did everything I wanted it to do easily. It worked smoothly and simply. I will use it all the time stapling my large booklets and projects.
1,Stapler doesn't work!,I received the stapler in the mail and straight out of the box it didn't work. I've asked for a replacement. The hassle of returning it and the $7 they're trying to charge me to replace it makes me wish I hadn't purchased the stapler in the first place. I'd advise holding off on ordering this stapler for now! I'll let you know if the replacement works.
3,swingline heavy duty stapler,"i guess i didn't read the info, i was really dissapointed it didn't staple a half sheet booklet. my fault, now i have to get another stapler."
2,Worked...for awhile,"Worked for about a year, but after awhile something bent inside and it no longer drives the staples all the way through the paper. It's in the garbage now."
5,Swingline Heavy Duty Stapler - Deluxe,"I needed a high-quality heavy-duty stapler quickly when ours broke. This one arrived almost immediately and was everything I hoped for and more. Also, the price was extremely competitive. Couldn't be happier and so is our staff!"
1,It Jams,"It jammed every time I tried to use it. A 5 minute project took approximately 2 hours. Consider another brand or model. Item returned to Amazon,for credit."
1,Not for people interested in ukulele music but in poetry,"Was looking for some listing of old songs with ukulele chords. Not this book! Poetry along the archie and mehitabel line. A few interspersed paragraphs, starting on page 20, about how to hold and strum and finger the uke and that's it! 95% is avant garde post modern 'poetry' if that is what you are looking for."
5,Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning,I had to purchase this book for a school library class I was taking. It's an excellent resource for all school librarians. I found the writing style to be very clear and very thorough in explaining the role of school librarians.
5,a must have for librarians,I have used this book in 2 classes for library school. It is a must have!
1,DULL,"This book is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Yet another overpriced, useless ALA publication thrown at students pursuing MLIS degrees. All the info is available online for free so save your money and do not purchase. What a waste of paper and ink!"
5,Thrilling account of 1877 version.,"Bruckner wrote 3 versions of this symphony (in 1883, in 1877, and finally in 1889. There is a FOURTH version of the 2nd movement from 1876. All versions, including the 1876 version of the 2nd movement, have been recorded.) The 1877 is a facinating combination of elements from the 1883 original and 1889 final thoughts with a few of its own. Sir Georg Solti and the CSO give a blazing, dramatic reading with tempos on the brisk side. The playing is of the highest order, but the first chair work is beyond that especially, in the winds and brass - Sublime!"
1,Not quite universal,"Before you buy this keyboard, check Belkin's official PDA compatibility list on their website, at http://web.belkin.com/support/download/downloaddetails.asp?download=1234&lang=1. (If link is deleted by Amazon, go to Belkin d.t com and then PDA accessories and then input devices and then wireless keyboard. You should see a link to the compatibility list in small font.) You should heed the list because you'll see a lot of PDAs (esp. newer ones) not on their list. The biggest problem is if you have a Pocket PC with the IR port on the side, and the Pocket PC does not support screen rotation, then you won't be able to use this even if the driver works. So this is pretty stupid as you can imagine. It would have been so easy for them to make the IR port on the keyboard rotatable."
1,IR port on the side? Don't bother!,"I bought this for my iPaq h1940 (a fine pocket PC, I should mention), but if your IR port is on the side, says the Belkin manual, you must lay the PPC sideways to align the port with the keyboard signal.This is ok I guess if your pocket PC has landscape disply settings. Mine doesn't. Yet Belkin still says this keyboard is ""compatible"" with the h1940...Problem #2: Except for the shortcut keys on the left side, none of the keys work! I'll try and see if Belkin can help with that."
4,Better than it seems,"Belkin's website documentation is wildly out of date and muddled so it was difficult to know if this keyboard would work with an Axim X51V PPC with ActiveSync 4.2 and WM5.0. But, after a lot of effort, I found it did. (I downloaded the Windows CE 2005 driver). Belkin have really shot themselves in the foot over all this...Although the PPC stand is very flimsy (the Stowaway one looks much better, and apparently has a better arrangement for beaming) the Belkin has the great advantage of a proper row of number keys at the top. It's a neat little keyboard, and all in all I am very satisfied. Leaving aside the compatibility list and driver problems, I can't understand what all the whingeing is about."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT,"IT""S OK WHEN ON A TABLE WITH PREFECT ANGLE OF THE MIRROR AND PERFECT DISTANCE TO IT BUT AS SOON AS THE KEYBOARD MOVES AWAY TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF TO THE LEFT OR TOO FAR FROM THE PDA AND IT DOESN""T WORK ANYMORE."
3,"Okay, but not phenomenal","The install went well, but it took me a little while to get my pda to work with the keyboard. I have a Pharos Traveler 535e with a side IR port, so I have to turn my unit sideways & adjust the orientation to landscape to work. The major issue I'm having is that I don't have petite hands. I had a Targus before, which was comfortable and commodious, but the Belkin is a little small for my taste. I find it funny that both keyboards fold up to a very similar size, given the space the Targus offers.Also, I liked that when I attached my Targus to my old iPAQ 3765, it worked automatically. The Belkin has to be turned on and off through the pda, which is a little more time consuming if you have an idea to get down right away. The plus on the Belkin, I think, is that it takes a battery, whereas the Targus works off the pda battery. That never really was a problem for me, though."
1,Never worked,"Software installed fine, but the keyboard never worked properly. Half the keys on the first one wouldn't work. Tech support first blamed me, saying I didn't install the driver right. Then after sitting on the phone with me step by step, they conceded it wasn't my fault and told me the board was defective. I exchanged it and that one would't work at all. After installing this software 10 times and pulling every trick I can find, I'm giving up."
1,It doesn't work with my clie NX,"At first, I installed a driver from the CD, but it didn't work. Then, I went to the support site to download a new driver.It still didn't work except one case....If I put the keyboard close enough to get a signal, I could use a keyboard.That means I should put something beneath the keyboard to make it close with a PDA.I will return it tomorrow.Unless they fix this problem, don't buy it."
1,didn't work,bought for my son for his birthday and need to return it. did not work with Sony CLie SJ22.
1,Never Worked with Tungsten E,"I jumped to Linux some weeks ago and got finally got syncing correct for my Tungsten E. However, I never got this keyboard to work with the E. It's true that the E is not mentioned as being supported, but I was told otherwise. Because I'm using Linux and the probs took so long to resolve, I can't return. I can't resell because I don't know if it's not simply broken.Palm says something about ""vcard"" not working with some 3rd party infrared devices for E. Make another choice if you don't use Windows/Mac and/or use Tungsten E.... Beware."
2,Not worth the money,"You will spend more time attempting to align the mirror than you will typing. Set up is easy; it's the every day use that is difficult. My Dell has the IR port on top and any movement throws off the beam so that I have to readjust the mirror or move the keyboard. In addition, the manual is woefully inadequate. It does a cursory job explaining short cut keys, functions and screen rotation. Look at other solutions - Belkin failed on this one."
4,Handy little keyboard,"This keyboard is quite easy to set up and use. The only drawback is that it's not quite a full size keyboard, but in some cases that's a good thing. The keys were a little stiff at first, but after a few minutes they were pretty easy to use. And yes, that infared port is a little sensitive, but the mirror makes it simple enough. That mirror will work for any pda with an infared port on the top half (and I know some are on the bottom, so I don't know if it would line up without the mirror or not). Overall it's a great product (especially for the price), and I would recommend it for anyone who needs a keyboard."
2,Does NOT work for the Palm Tungstens,"Although Amazon did not include the Tungstens, the Belkin box I bought elsewhere does list them them as supported. They are NOT supported and will cause your Palm to spontaneously hard reset losing everything on your PDA."
3,Pieces of it has disappeared after 1 day,"My 4 month old, 7lb puppy loves the green part and pieces of the raised dots had disappeared. I hope they are in the vacuum. The little yellow piece that sticks out at the top got chewed off on the 2nd day."
4,Good introduction to native gardening,"This isn't by any means exhaustive, either in coverage or growing information, but as an intro to native plants it is a fine addition to your library. Generally excellent photographs and an accessible page layout, with a description, requirements (soil type, sun), propagation tips, and good companions for each plant. Very pleasant to read.There is one goofy thing about this book that is worth mentioning: The plants are presented in alphabetical order by common name. This leads to confusion when you find nothing under Trillium, only to find it under ""Western Trillium,"" or you find Coneflower under ""Purple Coneflower."" The index lists only Latin names. To get around the problem of multiple common names, the book should be sorted by Latin name, and the common names should be available along with the latin names in the index."
4,Wille - Big Jon Side-Liner In-Line planer board,My husband lost one of his boards so we ordered another. He is very pleased with the product. The shipping was quick and he was able to go fishing and caught some nice size walleyes.
3,Superman and Batman are Joined by Other Heroes,"In this second volume of Generations, the stories jump ahead at eleven-year increments. While there is some additional information given about the Superman and Batman timelines from the first volume, most of the book actually concerns the lives of other DC heroes.Once again we see classic heroes in a universe where they age and breed at normal rates. This could have been very good, but there was just not enough space. Too many heroes are introduced with little or no explanation. Some are better fleshed out than others and some secrets of the universe are revealed.Generations was a wonderful book, but Generations II makes the reader feel that Byrne will have to fill in all of the years to make it work for the DC pantheon. But then that would eliminate the Generations idea. The adventures are entertaining, but we want to know more. Perhaps it would have been better to do a Flash Generations, Green Lantern Generations, Wonder Woman Generations, etc."
5,The post-Crisis DC Universe that should have been,"I wish that DC would keep this book (and its sequel) in print. First published in 2001, my reaction upon reading this was ""How utterly logical! Why didn't John Byrne just create this story after the original CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS?"" I'd have loved it if this were the actual post-Crisis DC Universe.I much preferred this reboot of the Superman mythos to the one Byrne actually did back in 1986 in THE MAN OF STEEL. And after the September 2011 rebooting of the DC Universe, this story looks even more attractive. Now that I'm reading far fewer current DC comics, it's time for a re-read of this whole Elseworlds arc.Until DC collects GENERATIONS III in trade paperback, I urge those that enjoyed this book (and the first GENERATIONS trade paperback) to seek out the individual issues."
5,Massive reggae,"This is a very good reggae compilation. Great songs for the summer. It's hard to get a reggae album that really sounds like reggae these days. That's why this collection from 1989 is great to listen to. Many romantic reggae songs plus a little dancehall and many great names: Barrington Levy, Sasafras, Freddie McGregor, Gregory Isaacs, Barry Boom, Frankie Paul, Athony Malvo, Tiger... It's hard to find stuff like this these days!"
5,Great British Reggae Roll Call 89/Massive 3 A Collection of British Reggae Hits,This is a must have for all reggae lovers. Lost my old copy and I'm grateful to Elite Digital for helping me replace it. It's worth every penny.
1,At least they look cool,"Yeah so I bought these shoes for work about 2 months ago. I got them because they were cheaper than sketchers they fit the description, and my girlfriend has some Steve Madden shoes shes happy with. I dont work in shipping and receiving, or anything like that I work in an office. The heel on my left shoe is coming off. These are so poorly made, if I had not oiled them the first 3 weeks I wore them the cracks would be too much to bear, and I would have to throw them away. Wooops Im going to have to do that anyways. So the moral of the story today people... Shell out an extra few bucks on your shoes like this, they are not plastic or rubber they are what you pay for."
2,Me's Rumbil Lace-Up,"I bought this shoe expecting to wear it as a work shoe on occasion, however, the shape of the shoe is very narrow and it doesn't seem to go with anything including jeans. The comfort level is ok, not spectacular. In reality I don't think this shoe lives up to the Steve Madden name. I can't recommend this shoe."
4,Great shoes!,These are great shoes for driving and around the house. The only negatives are the soles are very slippery if wet on smooth surfaces and the width of the design stitching are obviously different between the two feet. I love these shoes for driving and everyday around the house.
2,The Ruin of J. Robert Oppenheimer,"This book is a must read for anyone interested in the disgusting events that led to the ruin of one of our nations greatest scientists. I did not enjoy reading about how nasty some people in high places can be. It's a book I can highly recommend for it's inside look at the beginning of the atomic age, but not a book I can ""love""."
4,snoop is the dogg and he is the man....,hey wuz up foolz i just want to write that snoop is the best he can sing he is the BOMB and he is verrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyy cute..THANX PEACE OUT TO ALL THE DOGGZ LUV YA'.........
3,Poorly executed,Staking system is really kind of useless for tomatoes if you plant them to earthbox planting recommendations. The staking system is mounted in the middle while your plants are offset to one side. The net they send don't seem well thought out. I guess they planned on the tomatoes climbing it but I don't think it willMake the tomatoe plants grow straight. The staking system seems well built but it just was executed wrong. They should of made it offset so it would almost be in line with the tomatoe plants
2,Staking system weaker than the one I bought earlier,"This is the second staking system that I have bought for my Earth Boxes. The design has changed by eliminating a metal rod in the middle. Thus, the staking is weaker than the first system that I bought. Part of the problem (if you can call it a problem) is that my tomatoes grow so tall in the Earth boxes that I need a sturdier staking system."
4,"Easy enough to use, not sure the netting is strong enough","I was concerned about this system when I realized the supports went under the EB and I'd have to remove the casters I was relying on to move the EB around as needed. Fortunately the EB designers were way ahead of me; the casters have holes in the bottom of the supports to fit into, and even space for a third caster at each end (and the kit includes the two extra casters needed). So I was able to still push the EB around after installing the staking kit. Installing it was pretty straightforward with the exception of the netting, which was tricky to untangle and then I had trouble finding the corners until I realized the corners had *2* ties attached and the other netting ends only had one. The staking kit has been out in the Wyoming wind for over a month now without damage."
3,"Not Much Of An ""ATTACK""...","A lonely doll-maker shrinks people down to 12"" tall w/ his miniaturization machine. Trouble begins when John Agar (TARANTULA, BRAIN FROM PLANET EROS, JOURNEY TO THE 7TH PLANET, etc.) joins the ""puppet people"", and leads them into revolt against their unbalanced captor. Actually, not much happens, but the movie is enjoyable enough for a viewing..."
4,Old Fashioned Sci-Fi,"The special effects are not as good as they would be if it were made today but considering when this movie was made, I think they are pretty good! I love all the old black & white sci-fi Matinee type movies! Back then, the movie had a limited time to get to the point & get to the climax & everyting was done in a fast fashion without a lot of exposition! So much better than many of the movies now-a-days that take an hour just to get to the main point & another hour and a half to get to the climax! If you liked the old sci-fi movies, this is one you would want for your collection!"
3,Puppet People DVD Okay. Movie pure Mr. B.I.G.,"Bert I. Gordon (aka Mr. B.I.G.) decided that enlarging things had been overdone so he decided to shrink his cast in Attack of the Puppet People (aka Fantastic Puppet People). You hafta love when Gordon has the two leads go to a drive-in to see his Amazing Colossal Man. John Hoyt plays a lonely doll maker who has invented a machine that shrinks people to doll size. Hoyt keeps his 'dolls' in suspended animation stored in glass tubes and only brings them out when he wants to play.Not a bad little B film. John Agar is his usual B Movie self, but June Kenney is really awful as his love interest. John Hoyt gives a sweet, warped performance as the lonely doll maker. Truly one of his best efforts.MGM has used a decent copy of the film for this DVD. As is typical with MGM Mignite series, the only extra is the trailer. Hey, MGM, how about a feature commentary once in a while?"
3,"""genre folks will be pleased""","If you love B-movies (and since you're reading a review of ..""Puppet People"" I'm assuming that you do) then you ought to be pleased with MGM's DVD of this drive-in flick. *I'm assuming it was a drive-in I'm too young to remember!* Anyway, on to the film itself: great title, creepy performance by Hoyt *remember him from the T.Z. episode: ""Will the real martian stand up."" ? and cool special effects. cool B-movie moment: the Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde marionette show!! + isn't that one of the judges from, ""Son of Frankenstein"" that plays Dr. Franz's friend? Curious... Enjoy with popcorn and a double-feature of another of MGM's Midnite movies! (and at prices between 9.99-12.99) who can beat it?"
1,This sucks,"Even in the bad movie schema, this sucks. People get shrunk, ala Dr Shrinker, then the shrinkees randopmly, re appear at the end some normal sized and others, hey who knows. This is a stinker of mega mega proportions."
4,Puppet Man Throws Quite the Wild Party!,"Scary but tender tale of a warmhearted puppeteer whose high tech wizardry is light-years ahead of his time. Fantastic special effects and a fine cast highlight this treasure amongst science fiction classics from a bygone era. Action packed throughout, this thriller features a well developed story, clever plot, and intriguing dialogue, making it a perfect treat for sleepovers and slumber party's alike! The film itself is (in a sense) one big party as a brilliant but slightly crazed and eccentric senior citizen intellectual pulls out ALL the stops in risking a life in prison by refusing to abandon his lifelong dream and secret passion. Great fun for children and adults of all ages--Pretty intense at times but a mild breath of fresh air compared to Chucky and friends. Although the movie is VHS--It looks as clear as DVD!"
5,JOHN HOYT,"For all of you who have seen Attack Of The Puppet People. John Hoyt also appeared twice on Leave It To Beaver, first as a clothing store salesman and next as a man who sells accordions. He was also in the Twilight Zone story Lateness Of The Hour as Dr. Loren who has a robot daughter named Jayna. and he was also in The Man With The X-Ray Eyes as a doctor who doesnt approve of Ray Milland's medical procedures. He was also an alien creature in The Bellero Shield, a 1964 Outer Limits Story starring Martin Landau"
2,"Phone is great, answering machine is....","I have to admit, I was highly impressed with telephone capabilities of this system. There was no interference with our wireless Internet (a constant problem in our house), it was feature packed, and the color screen was very cool.However, I have never dealt with such a quirky answering machine. It would answer the first 4 or 5 calls, and then it would stop answering (even though the answering machine was turned on the entire time). It would not pick up on the next 2 or 3 telephone calls (which we checked via caller ID), and then it would work again. We returned it and exchanged for another, but still had the same problem. Very unfortunate as it was a great phone otherwise."
2,Quality control,"Pros: This phone is great for it's features, price, and sound quality.Cons: Quality control!* The first phone I got, the base station is very noisy, unusable at all!.* Then I returned it, get an replacement unit. This time base station don't have any problem. But after 6 days, the cordless phone can not be charged any more. Battery indicator stays at 1/4 full battery.* And when used with a hand free headset, the mic volume is too low. I've tried 2 different headsets, all the same.Uniden really need better quality control. I am going to return this 2nd unit, and never buy from them again. Wasting my time."
2,Bizarre non-intuitive design,"This phone performs most of the functions that I wanted, but has some puzzling design flaws.#1 annoyance: instead of clear labels like ""hold,"" ""mute,"" etc., the buttons on this phone have bizarre graphic symbols that look like the international biohazard marker. The only words above the buttons are ""answer on/off,"" ""do not disturb,"" ""find handset,"" and ""flash."" Consequently, no one in my house could figure out how to perform simple functions such as playing and deleting messages until I looked in the manual. And the keys they chose for these things are ridiculously non-intuitive. For example, ""mute"" is assigned to the ""find handset"" key! Of course, I always think ""find handset"" when I want to mute the phone!And I can't for the life of me figure out why they put a mute function on the base station, BUT NOT THE HANDSET. Hello, what is it that people actually TALK into?So other than the fact that this phone is a badly designed piece of junk, it's just great."
4,Great Phone,"I was a bit skeptical to purchase this phone based on the negative reviews. I am however liking it a whole lot. The menu is easy to navigate, the buttons are soft touch and the speaker phone is great. The design is also extra slick and looks very attractive.There could have been some nicer ring tones though."
1,Hidden facts,If you plan on throwing away your hard earned money purchase this Item. Uniden stopped manufacturing this model since 2005. The batteries for this model can hardly be found and if so believe me the possibility of it being good is less than 25%. I purchased this from a company ADGTRON through Amazon and did not attempt to hook up the phone for three months since I got it for my mom and could not get it to her before. When I hooked it up after charging the battery for over 18 hrs the face of the phone remained dark. I e-mailed ADGTRON explaining to them what had happened and all I got was HOG WASH. My humble advise stay away from this phone and stay away from ADGTRON.
3,It's been a month and it still doesn't work,"It's a horrible phone!!! I got it a month ago, and I put it to charge and I still can't use it because it won't charge properly. I called customer service, they said it's the batery that's bad, but I have to see if they send me one. So, I never used the phone and it's just sitting here. It sucks, because the phone is very beautiful.P.S. I reached their customer service by phone and they were very understanding, so they sent me a new battery and now the phone works great! I love the phone, it has a lot of features, it's a very good phone once it works. LOVE IT NOW!"
3,Beware,"Phone works fine but one major flaw appears to be:There is a limit of 10 handsets that can be registered. Lets say you registered 10 hand sets and you lost couple of them.. you wont be able to reset the base unit to factory setting. The user manual does not show or talk about this limitation. I now have only 4 handsets at home, but over the past year registered over 10 handsets. So, now because of the limitation, I am unable to add any more handsets even though I have only 4 handsets active. There is no way to delete or remove registered handsets that were lost"
2,OK for first year,"I bought one of these phones plus 3 satelites and they worked reasonably well for the first year. The main problems being range - some of the phones would not operate unless they were within 20ft of the base (clear line of sight) whereas others worked up to about 100ft through walls. After 12 months use, only two of the original four phones work - the others just emit hash. I've tried swapping batteries and reregistering them with the base but I can't get these to work.It's a shame because otherwise they had all the features we needed."
1,Don't Buy This Phone,"We've had this phone for about a year.There are 2 major flaws with this phone.1. Range - Maximum Range from base to handset is about 15 feet. More than that and you get static or dropped call.2. Unable to Connect To Base. We receive this message alot. Even when standing next to the base.We've had these 2 issues off and on over the last year. It has gotten to the point where we can only answer an imcoming call by using the speaker phone located on the base unit. Needless to say, we are dumping this piece of garbage and getting a new (non-uniden) phone."
1,Don't do it,"Don't buy it. In the 6 months I had the phone, the screen burnt out so I can see the numbers, the answering machine is horrible, and I get better reception from my baby monitor. I had a cheap Panasonic beforehand which was much better. This was a complete waste of $$. Hooking it up to your PC to get those ""cool"" features is just a pain. I'm having a tough time returning this. Be careful."
3,One great song ...,... and nine that are somewhat more ordinary. But that great one -- the Tobin Sprout-like title track -- is worth the price of admission (especially when this can be purchased so cheaply used) and the others are at least listenable.
2,Weight Loss Yoga,Very disappointed. The DVD was very repetitive and actually was boring. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone who is seeking a good yoga or weight loss DVD.
3,"Good yoga workout, but too much time spent on promotional intro.","I have several of Trudie Styler's workout DVD's. I enjoy each of them very much and can contend with the introduction portion of her other ones -- as fast forwarding is blocked during this time, unable to skip directly to the start of the practice. I cannot contend with the length of the introduction in her ""Weight Loss Yoga"". I work out twice daily with DVD's and this one is most annoying due to the excessive length of time taken to promote her other DVD's before getting to the actual workout. I have to plan around this portion, by putting her DVD in to play while I leave the room to do something else until the program begins. Frustrating to say the least. If I'm in a hurry on a particular day and need to just get right to a quick workout, I have to choose another practioners DVD over Ms. Styler's because of this waste of time. Does anyone know how to skip over these annoying introductions ???"
5,Excellent quality- great speciality knife,"I had been looking for a good quality cheese knife for semi-hard cheese and found this one and thought I'd try it. The knife works exactly as intended and is of excellent quality. If you are tired of your cheese sticking to the knife or don't like to use the cheap wire cutters, this is a great investment."
2,Something else to live in the drawer,"I am very disappointed with this knife. Supposedly it's etched to provide some sort of air gap to prevent sticking to the cheese, and while there certainly is a diamond pattern on the sides, it's just as smooth as can be. Side by side my serrated Revereware knife set that I've had for at least a dozen years cuts cheddar easier than this. Perhaps it will find a new life slicing potatoes or semi-firm fruit, but as a $45 cheese knife, I sure wish I hadn't have wasted so much money."
4,A Good Disk,"This is a good disk. I ordered this on genre-alone -- to explore some intelligent drum and bass. I was disappointed at the first two tracks, but the rest slowly got better -- my favorite track on this disk being Efferuescence from Parallax. This is perfect for office-use, being all expunged from a nite before, or lifting one's spirits in an up-beat, and Science-Fiction manner. This gets 4 stars from me only because the first two tracks left more to be desired."
2,BEWARE: THIS SET DOES NOT CONTAIN THE ENTIRE PROGRAMS,"This is a collection of documentaries, video of live performances, and ""personal best"" compilations for the Python players. Fine if that's what you want. But if you are looking for discs containing complete programs, these are not them. The packaging is similar to The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus 16-Ton Megaset, which contains the complete programs, but this collection is not the same thing at all, it's ""everything else.""The packaging of the two products is very similar, so it's easy to be mislead looking at the small versions of the cover art online."
5,Mahler 4th conducted by Dohnanyi,"This is possibly the best performance of Mahler's 4th Symphony. The performance is very organized and logical, with quick tempos that have been carefully measured to bear rational relationships to one another. The nuances in the instrumental playing are some of the most sensitive on recording and the overall balance of the sound is very clean and even. Dohnanyi brings pure intelligence and deep emotional understanding to the performance. If this is ""nature"" music, the overall tone is that of early springtime. Highly recommended, if they could only restock it."
4,Excellent Reference Source,I really enjoy this book because it's an excellent reference souce for quick reference of god/goddess/mythology at my finger tips. It also provides detailed information and summaries of mythology from around the world just as the title states.
4,Probably as good as can be expected,"This book covers a lot of ground in a relatively small space, so the thinness of some of the entries should be expected. It is probably a good starting point for anyone's mythological inquires. However, there are several entries that were surprisingly inadaquate. For instance, the entry under Gnosticism, way under reports the complexity of it's mythology, and without any indication that there is more to know, if one even wanted to explore it. Holes like this one make me wonder what other holes there may be that I don't even know about."
1,The Oxford Companion to World Mythology,"To be honest and I quote from the book "" The Kaffir-Zulus, for instance, have Unkulunkulu, made in the image of the supreme being, who was born miraculously from the earth"" end, i find this sentence offensive. I have only started reading this book today after buying it late November, when I found this offensive heinous term. I should never have bought this book had I know that was how they were going to refer to Africa people. One star is just to good for it. Its to bad I can not return it.David Leeming. The Oxford Companion to World Mythology (p. 8). Kindle Edition.Eileen"
3,Short on short cuts,"Just remember that this is the 2003 edition and while helpful, I have found things that are outdated now. I went to look for two resturants, both of which were closed. I would have greatly appreciated more narrative with the listings, like a Zagats-style rating and description. However, it provides a nice start. If you know nothing about the Hamptons, you may want to supplement with another book. The children's version, Annabel's Shortcuts, is merely taken from the kid's section of this Shortcuts, so don't purchase both."
2,Shortcuts,"I had expected the author-resident of this book to reveal much more about the Hamptons rather than just a compiliation of names and addresses. In my estimation the book doesn't reveal much insight or short-cuts as the name (""Short-cuts"") might infer.Is does give you a shortened version of the yellow pages."
4,No 'esplainin' to do here!,we really enjoyed this game over the Christmas holiday. Much fun and recalls all of the memories of the Lucy sagas!
1,Ruined my phone!,Have an older phone that was working fine but had lost the home charger. Ordered this one. Came quickly. First time we used it our phone froze and developed problems that it had never had. Problem continues and most of the time the phone is not useable. Wish I hadn't ordered it. No response from seller after sending him info on the issue.
1,item does not work,"This item does not work, and I have been unable to get the seller to contact me to return it for a refund. Likewise, I have been unable to get Amazon to contact me to make this right. I am not very happy at all."
5,This is so good that it will surprise you!,"Julius Katchen wasn't a household name around my house until I bought this recording at a friend's recommendation. Wow!These are not cookie cutter interpretations of these well known concertos. Katchen has all the technique he needs plus an interpretive ability that lets him make them his own while still remaining true to the music. Given how many times these things have been recorded that is saying quite a bit, I think.The London Symphony under Piero Gamba is a fine accompanist for Katchen.The approach is full throated and the fourth is wonderfully aggressive with the last movement being almost wild!This is a very nice set to have in your collection."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is the worst game i have ever played, the controls are crappy, it's mostly german, the grafix are 256 colors, if you don't believe me go to http://pc.ign.com then reviews and search for demon world. If you want a good RTS wait for warcraft 3 or get starcraft."
5,A great mystery,"""Le Domino Noir"" is such a delightful, elegant and utterly irresistible opera that one wonders why it's not perform with more frequency. Recordings such as this, filled with élan and joie de vivre reminds one of the effects of fine champagne and further proves that when it comes to elegance and charm, no one can hold a candle to the French. A delightful recording of a gem of an opera, which judging by the results, was as fun to perform and record as it is to hear. Bonynge is most assuredly in his element. """
2,not as effective,"i own this myself and ants have taken over my kitchen. after saying that it prevents for up to 30 weeks. well, thats just not the case. i have to spray at least 2 times a day. i hear using vinegar is more effective"
2,it's not that good,"the guy who is talking has no idea who the Offspring are,he doesn't call it ""come out and play"" he says come and play.they give false information,kristine is not in the Lunachicks her sister(theo) is.the little book inside it is not binded together very well,5 of the pages fell out. the only good part of the cd is when dexter and noodles are talking on an old radio interview."
1,waste of time,"It's ""messages"" are from a parker brothers game. These teachings are hardly a basis for an ethos. If you need a crutch for introspection and daily existence try ""Celestine prophecy"" atleast it tells you to eat right and notice the power struggles in everyday conversation, that's something. This books ideas aren't new, it just rearranges them into parker's bros. games as mediums."
4,don't like the changes,"It's nice that there's recent channeling as commentaries to the chapter, but the typeset of the original version was much easier to read, as Michael's comments were easily differentiated and had more of an impact. I'd recommend the book wholeheartedly, but would suggest finding a used copy of the old version."
5,Messages from Michael,"Very well written, enabling me to further ""connect the dots"" - a wonderful addition to my collection. For those who are interested in ""mediumshp"" a ""must have""."
3,Interesting worldview,"This book details ""psychic"" sessions held over quite a number of years, laying out worldview in a lot of detail.The information is complex so the comprehension is limited with only one read.Probably would help to read the sequels also."
5,Best EVER Show,"I've watched this show from the first episode and it just keeps on getting better and better. The stories are awesome and it is so funny but also full of intense, scary moments. I'll always watch this show and hope they don't cancel it!!! I would go into withdrawal!!!!"
5,Excellent Show!!,"I only found this show a month or two ago, but I am already caught up to the third season. I had to go back and watch all the previous episodes :D"
1,You have GOT to be kidding,"I suppose if your IQ were in the mid 90's, you'd find these books amusing. I had the misfortune of taking both this one and ""More Mirth..."" as reading material on a cross-country flight. After 200 pages, no giggling, but lots of ""oh come on"" rolling of the eyes. Sophmoric crap. I ended up reading the US Airways magazine and doing the crossword instead."
5,Subtitle is true: It really is the best contemporary humor!,"Many humor anthologies are very hit and miss, and they also tend to be very much a ""boys only"" club. Mirth of a Nation is of the best I've ever seen, both in terms of quality and in including an good representation of women humorists. Michael J. Rosen has done an excellent job in compiling humorists such as Fran Lebowitz, Dave Barry, Mark O'Donnell, Jon Stewart, David Sedaris, Colleen Werthman, Patricia Marx and Henry Alford, just to name a few. This anthology would make a wonderful gift for just about anyone in any age group (it is pretty much ""clean humor""). Treat yourself with it at any time, but especially if you are going to be on a plane,train, or subway. I hope they have many sequels!"
2,A great disappointment,"Despite being a fan of any number of the contributors, I found this collection incredibly frustrating. So much of it fell flat for me-- Death of an Interior Designer, How to Be Difficult, Emily Dickinson, Memo to Staff, all three fables, and more. The Dave Barry was standard, but the only stand-out was Josh Kornbluth's Red Diaper Baby. I'm awfully glad I just got this from the library and didn't put any money into it."
2,Beginers?,"I wish I had read the review ""Yoga or Yada"" before I purchased this book for my 74 year old mother. I feel the books set up is out of wack ( the bleep on breathing is in the back of the book ), and the pictures are very intimidating. I thought this book would be a little more for beginners, like the title suggests, with easy yoga poses and more detail on breathing. Instead I read and saw expert Yoga students and teachers showing off their limberness and writing of the author's greatness and their own. I would return this book to Amazon but by the time I paid for the postage it would be a waste. The Yoga book I bought for myself (The Little Yoga Book) I feel is much more appropriate for all beginners regardless of age."
5,What an encouraging book for older adults!,"After more than 30 years of teaching therapeutic exercise and Yoga for older adults, and having written a book for instructors (Seniors On The Move, published by Human Kinetics), I truly appreciate Suza's book, the New Yoga for People over 50. Both for students and for instructors, it's one of the most helpful and realistic guides for older adults I have seen in all these years. It addresses so many basic and critical issues related to aging and gives a very hopeful picture: the choice of REgeneration over DEgeneration, no matter what the age or present physical condition. I know how much work it is to write a book, how much sitting it requires, and respect and congratulate Suza for writing it! Even though no book can replace a good class, this book serves as a great inspiration and offers so much insight and education. Renate Rikkers, Exercise & Yoga Therapist. Author, Seniors On The Move"
2,Yoga or Yada?,I bought this book on the enthusiastic recommendation of everyone else and was shocked when I got it. Ninety percent of it is testimonials about how wonderful the author and her guru are. I've now gone back to Mary Stewart who gives you poses and routines and doesn't find it necessary to charge money for others to read her praises.
1,respect your body!,"The cover picture alone should be enough to avoid picking up, let alone buying this book. Yoga specially for us 'older bodies' should be gentle and challenging, not impossible!"
4,Wow,"This is a good book, well done. Don't know if I'll be able to do this, but this book has good pictures so maybe I can."
2,A Misleading Book,"The photos in the book lead you to believe that with a few simple props and some effort an over-50 person of average flexibility can achieve the pretzel postures of Iyengar. I just don't believe it. I started yoga at age 65. I had done high-impact aerobics for 10 years prior and still do. I am quite active. But I will never be able to accomplish the postures that the author probably chose as inspirational. Nevertheless, I have made slow but steady progress (without props) starting with simple postures and moving on to intermediate postures. Yoga is wonderful for strength, flexibility, breathing, and relaxation. I started with ""The American Yoga Association Beginner's Manual"" by Alice Christensen three years ago and I am now ready to move on to an intermediate level."
1,Wrong title: Yoga for People > 70 for use at a Yoga Center,"This book is not for people in their fifties, in my opinion, the book is written for a much older audience. What makes the book completly usless is its implecit assumption that one will be attending a Yoga center. Most of the photos show devices not foundin a normal home such as a safety harness. We returned the book for a refund."
4,Inspiring for Individuals of Any Age!,"Suza Francina presents Yoga as it should be presented, as a fun, healthful way of life that can aid its practitioners in maintaining or reclaiming health. The active older adults pictured in various asanas are thoroughly delightful and awe-inspiring. I only hope to be in such fantastic shape in my autumn and winter years! As a Yoga teacher, Tai Chi and QiGong instructor, personal trainer, N.D. (Naturopathic Doctor) student, biologist, and lifelong health enthusiast, I recommend this book to anyone who has considered trying Yoga but has been concerned that it would be too difficult to be enjoyable or safe. This book reiterates that the practitioner should listen to the body's cues and should try to master the asanas slowly and gently, and that improving one's health IS possible. Also-superb health and vitality tips, info on osteoporosis, menopause, menstruation, stress, using props for safe execution of the asanas, and more. Well worth the nominal fee!"
1,Disappointing,This is more hype than how-to. I have never had any patience with salespeople and sales is what this is about. The substance is minimal.
5,Great For Older Beginners and Those With Chronic Injuries,"Easy to understand, helpful and encouraging for those of us who suffer from old injuries and general stiffness. Lots of good advice and modifications for older people who still want the benefits of yoga but have concerns about stiffness, weakness and old injuries. Great book."
1,The Church is NOT a Business; Not Impressed,"I purchased this book after reading ""Starting a House Church"". I am one who is very concerned about the ""Institutional/Audience Church"" and I just want to make sure you understand my review in that context.The church is not a business and this book seems to lean in that direction with its views on having a board of elders (the board) with one head elder (CEO). They bring up the Bylaws which is just an unbiblical idea in the first place. I find it interesting that they do not give any scriptures for having a head elder, and just use what has worked or not worked as a basis for their structure. Experience is a huge factor, but to teach something that is not found in scripture as fact is a dangerous thing.I read through the first couple chapters and then skimmed the rest, reading bits a pieces, only to return it to Amazon. It wasn't what I was looking for."
4,Very Helpful & Practical,The Biblical Role of Elder's for Today's Church is a very practical book that gives realistic insight into how elders can and should function in the local church. It is soundly biblical and contains many examples. Useful for those involved in church leadership.
4,"Visually Poe, Visionary Poem.","I think definitely Edgar Allan Poe is most creative Writer that have ever world. So then Vincent Price is most creative(as sinister image, overwhelming Performance, Charismatic persona, Charicteristic role-play) actor that have ever world. It follows from the foregoing that Roger Corman is a creative translator of an image, but faithful. I think they are marvelous trio. Price-Corman team made successful a succesion of their movie. 'The Haunted Palace' is one of them."
3,"Not Poe, but still good","This entry in the American International - Poe adaptions is often overlooked. The film opens with Vincent Price playing a man who is accused of witchcraft and burned alive, but not before promising a curse on the town. Years later, Price plays his own ancestor who comes to claim his ancestrial home. The townspeople think he is evil and has come to carry out the curse. An eerie painting proceeds to take over Price during brief periods and odd things start to happen within the house and people in the town start dying in brutal ways. The title of this film was taken from the Poe poem, but the story is from H.P. Lovecraft. The acting is very good, ecspecially Price in his transformations from good to evil. Lon Chaney Jr. has a small supporting role that was originally intended for Boris Karlof who turned it down for health reasons. The costumes and sets are also very good. This is definitely worth a viewing because it is better than it's reputation."
3,Pretty handy item,"I've been looking for a ""stocking donner"" for years now as I became less and less flexible. Basic skills, like being able to dress one's self is critical when you are disabled. This item allowed me to put my socks on by myself rather than having to wait around to have someone else do it for me. And frankly allowed me to feel a little less disabled and dependant on others. It only adds to a sense of independance and I'll take that whenever and wherever I can."
1,The worst kind of manual,"This is the worst kind of manual - a tutorial. Everything is turotials. You can't get a simple answer to a simple question. For example. Have a question about selection markees? All you can do is follow a tutorial for page after page looking for something that might be applicable to your actual question. There is no simple explanation of the various markees. It's the same with any question you might want an answer to. Go to their CD, open their files and follow a tutorial that might eventually get you where you need to go and might not. Can you tell I'm hot? I just wasted $50 on this book.Also, this is a PC book, which gives bare lipservice to the Mac world. If you work on a Mac, don't buy this book"
4,"Beautiful Playing, but Bad Recording","I won't say much, because I'd just be echoing the favorable comments of the others. Just say that this is great playing and I have not heard a finer version of Kreisleriana or a more electrifying Humoreske, whose restrained energy was a suprise to me. The Kinderszenen was beautiful as well, played at a quicker whimsical pace, not as slow and maudlin as some recordings of this I've heard. Lupu coaxes a one of a kind tone from the piano. Robust, full, but never harsh or banging. This man has strong fingers. My only beef is that the recording levels are set way way too low! And the microphones sound like the piano is recorded in a tile bathroom, way too much reverb. Besides these difficulties, Lupu's playing, to his credit, shines through. A worthwhile purchase, a great contrast to Horowitz and Argerich."
5,An excellent take on the super hero game genre,"First and foremost - this is an excellent rules system for allowing the simulation of most super characters from DC, Wildstorm or Marvel (granted they won't be starting characters).It is fairly easy to use and unique for gaming products, it has an index - something you'll need for character creation the first few times.The biggest disappointment is the scatter shot presentation of world material, which is 4 color and feels like an immersion into the world, it lacks organization and some clarity. For most GM's this shouldn't present too much trouble as they begin to steal from their favorite comics.Overall this is a great game, and well worth the money, especially for the hardcover! Buy it, you won't regret it."
4,Be a Tennis Pro,"This game takes the game of tennis right to the palm of your hand. I've played ""Virtual Tennis"" for the GBA and this game is more realistic.The Good Points:1) Play against ""real"" tennis pros2) Variety of shots easy to hit, one button for each shot. You can hit with FLAT, TOP SPIN, SLICE, LOB AND DROP SHOTS.3) Graphics the best I've seen for a hand held game system.4) ""Create player"" allows you to create a player in your own image. Train him and improve his skills and play on the world tour circuit.5) Play head to head with only one card.Negative Points:1) Player movement a bit sluggish at times.2) If you don't like tennis, this game may be repetative after a while."
5,Love this book,"I absolutely love this book, but my real love about it is the computer Gem. The book was originally published under the title ""The Miracle Wife,"" and you really need to read ""The Twenty-four Hour Bride"" first to get the background for the computer's history."
5,Joshua Bell and Montreal Symphony offer sensitive Prokofiev,"The two Prokofiev violin concertos recorded here with Charles Dutoit conducting the Montreal Symphony are wonderful examples of reading beyond the notes. Bell, even though only 25 years old at the time, plays the fiendishly difficult passages with a facile understanding of just how to fit the violin into the fabric of the orchestral score. And, Dutoit never allows the orchestra to overpower or strain the solo lines, giving the entire work a cohesive and organic unity which I have not heard from other recordings. Bell's sense of pitch is nothing short of phenomenal. In addition, the Love of Three Oranges Suite is an exceptionally musical complement to the CD. This album was withdrawn far too soon from the catalogue; it's to be hoped that a reissue is in order."
1,CHEAP JUNK !,"THE PART THAT PLUGS INTO YOUR RECEIVER AND SPEAKERS BREAKS OFF VERY EASILY. THE COMPANY THAT SELLS THEM IS GOOD, THEY SENT ME A SECOND SET.SINCE THE TIPS SCREW OFF, I JUST REPLACED THE BROKEN TIPS, SO NO BIG DEAL, BUT THIS TYPE OF CONNECTION IS NOT GREAT, JUST POPULAR FOR EASE OF USE."
3,All-star alt-Brit,"3 1/2Certainly a step above generic rock benefits, Help could still use some after the disproportionate first segment prepares for a letdown, even if it is a gentle one. All and all this one is worth getting if more then a few of these artists appeal even if it can play like a glorified b-sides disc."
5,Good educational DVDs,"This are great DVDs (2) worth every pennies. Even if you are healthy, you want to be educated on what food can do to your health. It has over 4hrs materials total, over 2hrs food cooking demonstrations and about 2hrs lectures."
1,Wished I'd returned the book,"I agree with the other reviewers. I, too, was looking forward to a critical and well-argued review of Albright's career. Instead, this book is page upon page of thin fawning and simplistic worship. Just for fun, I tried to find one single paragraph critical of Albright in the chapter on her relationship with Powell. I couldn't find one.Where was the editor when this book was being written? Why was this author chosen to write this biography? Surely there must be credible authors able to recount a far more analytical and balanced story than Thomas Blood."
2,The book was biased and bland.,"I was really dissapointed by this book. Maybe if the author could have been able to get past his admiration for Albright, the book would have been a little bit more focused and not so gushy. Albright could do no wrong in this book. She was made to look flawless; to me, she was not credible. I really respect Madeline Albright, but this book was just so jaded with flattery and soft liberal overtones. I would recommend Ann Blackman's Season of Her Life; it is a little bit better."
1,one-dimensional writing,"I work ""inside the beltway"" and Mr. Blood's book should be praised for its attempt to put Secretary Albright on a pedastal. The media today takes great pleasure in tearing down the character of politicians, atheletes, etc. But this book cannot be taken seriously; it is too one-sided in its portrayal of Ms. Albright and the issues Mr. Blood writes about are too ""cut and dried"" by his account. Shame on him - with his experiences in Washington he should know such issues are imbued with plots, subplots, and unknown factors. Mr. Blood's experience as a lobbyist comes through in his writing, as he could no doubt convince Americans that Washington DC has cool, dry summers. I wish Mr. Blood better luck in his future attempts."
4,refreshingly positive,"Political biographies have more than there share of critics .Everyone thinks they could do a better job than that of the person holding office. Blood did a good job of showing the history of Madeline Albright and what she was bringing to the table. It was refreshing to 'not see' the usual bashing of a Washington Woman who Blood himself called ""tough-as-nails."" The only biographies most people think are ""balanced' are those that tear apart the subjects accomplishments. After reading this book I felt positive and hopeful for other women in politics and passed it along to my daughter, a political science major at Harvard.(she also enjoyed it.)"
5,Much More Entertaining and Informative Than Expected.,"You never quite know how good a ""dummies"" or ""Idiots"" guide will be until you dig in. Like the nursery rhyme, some are too much, some are too little, and a few are just right. Put this book in the latter category.Covering items as varied as the 4-3 Over defensive line alignment and tailgating foods, Theismann and Tarcy entertain and inform in such a way that even fans that are somewhat knowledgable about the game will likely enjoy the book. Written with the casual fan in mind, this book may be a bit ""too much"" for the complete novice, and certainly an expert in teh game will not gain a whole lot here. However, if you are a casual fan, or even a bit beyond that and looking for more insights into a fascinating game that has captivated America - this is a good book to read."
2,not enough info,"great show, but like first reveiw, I agree, NOT ENOUGH INFO TO MAKE ANY KIND OF JUDGEMENT TO BUY THIS SET. is lack of info because of being lazy or incoputant"
2,Very unhappy,"I was very unhappy with the end result with these guys. The unit came in just fine and quickly, but when I found out that it was incompatible with our network setup; The service went down the drain, and they refused to take back the unit."
3,DOESNT DO ALL I WANTED,NICE TO HAVE A SCANNER THAT CAN DO MORE THAN ONE PAGE AT A TIME BUT THE FILES COME OUT TO BIG TO EMAIL
2,"Okay, but not a real winner","I've had this scanner for about a year and haven't experienced any paper jams, but it is slow, and since I connect to a laptop, if you plug the scanner into a different USB port than the one it was installed, better be prepared to reinstall it again, which is long, slow process (almost 30 minutes last time). The software is lame and I think I'm on my third ""driver"" update. Shame, because you can't beat the price of this scanner, but performance and quality of the unit are suspect at best."
1,Do not buy this Scanner!!,"I only rated this product with 1 star because no provisions are made for negative 10!!!I requested a scanner for my department and was provided with this one. Since receiving it, it has been a source of much discontent for me. It was hoped acquiring this machine would assist in productivity but since our acquisition we have made more calls to the service department than we did before. Firstly, it jams for no reason!! My personal assistant now wastes time feeding one sheet of paper at a time to be scanned. It is totally unreliable and stops working without notice. If the document contains a signature or anything apart from ""typewritten fonts"" the entire document is scanned in ""gibberish""!!!This product was a waste of money!!!"
1,What a piece of junk!,"I originally wrote that this scanner was great, but boy was I wrong. It jams, it stops working for no apparent reason and the Twain and WIA user interfaces are horrible. I have gone through 3 scanners and 2 returns of the ADF to HP for replacement with no luck. What a piece of junk. I purchased a Xerox Documate 510 which seems to do a much better job. I'm sending this thing to HP's CEO for his new office door-stop."
1,Not so good,"HP makes great printers, but everything else they make is garbage. This is my second HP scanner and its about to go to the recycle bin along with the other one.Nothing but problems since the day I got it. Its unbelieveable how many problems I've had with this scanner. Now it has started shutting itself down in the middle of a scan.Don't buy it!"
3,Pleased but not blown away,"The quality of the flat scanner is better than the average scanner on the market. The feeder on the top could use a little work, jamming is sometimes a problem. There are too many steps for two-sided scanning and the software does not perform as described in the turorial."
5,scanjet,The perfect addition to a home office. The multisheet duplex scanner is as easy as load the sheet feeder and push the scan button. Reduces the paper work clutter in my home office everyday. I just scan it then shred it
2,"Great HP name, poor execution","This is really not a horrible product. HP claims on its site that this scanner is compatible with Mac OSX 10.6 Not until after I got the scanner and tried to download the software that I discovered HP did not plan to release 10.6 software til the coming spring. Besides that i'm sure it works great with other computers...The duplex is really truly slow... unlike other duplex scanners that scan both sides of the page at the same time, this scanner scans one side, then flips the page around, scans the other side, flips it around AGAIN to spit it back out the other end....quality was decent, scans were typically straight, and clear...file sizes were larger than normal, but that was HP's software... Instead I decided to use my brother All in one laser copy fax to scan everything in using the Automatic Document Feeder....It was only $99 compared to HP's $259, its faster, and produces smaller PDF sizes....PLUS...works PERFECTLY with Mac OSX 10.6-"
3,No Tech Support,"Nice piece of hardware for the price, but no tech support whatsoever to correct problems:1. Five buttons on front have no labels. Either that or the back lighting doesn't work.2. Scan software insists on appending sequence numbers to file names with no way to shut off.3. Typical software for a hardware company: geeky and hard to figure out."
1,Complete waste of money,"The automatic document feeder basically doesn't work. HP should indicate on the packaging that the ADF is more ""ornamental"" than ""functional"". I've resorted to using it as a flatbed scanner, but even this is terrible. The driver software is totally busted. It keeps trying to install re-install itself before every scan (I have to manually kill the install process everytime). I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling, using alternate drivers... everything.What a waste of money."
2,You want peanut butter with all that jam?,"I mean jelly. Bought this to turn the archive our ugly metal filing cabinet and e-file all these bank statements and bills. Using XP. Easy to set up. I use the document feeder the most. I think I spend more time removing paper jams than actually scanning. I'm about to throw this out the window! Whether duplexing or not, it still jams! And it's a pain in the but to remove the jam. Don't bother with this thing. I give it 2 star because it was easy to set up and the software is easy to understand."
1,Exemplifies the demise of HP quality,"Buggy hardware and software. Software has multiple patches trying to correct multiple problems, but most of the patches don't correct the problems. Scanner ""locks up""frequently. Tech support from India was worthless. Much time was wasted uninstalling and reinstalling software to get the scanner to work. The first scanner stopped working and was replaced by HP, then the replacement scanner stopped working outside the warranty period. My experience with this scanner a dead-on-arrival HP media card reader and the premature demise of my HP 3200 All In One printer have ended my use of HP peripherals and products in my home and office."
1,Two strikes = OUT,"The orginial scanner we rec'd broke the first time we tried to use it. We got a ""lamp"" error. We ordered a replacement, and when it was installed, something was missing to make it incompatiable with our computer! After two tries, we decided to request a refund rather than try a 3rd time."
2,Worked great for 5 months - then died!,"This scanner worked perfectly for the first 5 months. I probably scanned 3000 pages of stuff. Then all of a sudden I could not ""initialize scanner"". I use it with my MacBook Pro. The scanner shows up in my ""About This Mac"", just not in the HP software anymore. After navigating HP's voicemail jail for almost an hour, I gave up. Its almost like they want to prevent you from speaking with a real support person! I am ordering the Fujitsu Snapscan. It comes very highly recommended."
1,Totally worthless,"Don't but this scanner. It is totally worthless. It jams on everything, you can't remove the pages without destroying them. You'd be better off trying to scan with a shredder."
2,Difficult Installation,"I have just installed this scanner so I cannot comment on its long term effectiveness but the installation process was hellacious, probably the most difficult peripheral I have had to install in a considerable length of time.There is an inordinate amount of voodoo science with the product. It doesn't work with a surge protector, only if plugged directly into an outlet (I don't know if a simple power strip works); I have never encountered such a restriction before. There is a very precise sequence required in connecting the scanner to the computer, and in powering down if a restart is required. Finally the software as shipped (I'm using Mac OS X) simply doesn't work. One has to download software from the HP site. It's one thing to have to upgrade a provided version, its something else when the provided software just doesn't work. I'm hoping the rest of the experience with the scanner is better than that initially."
1,DONT BUY THIS SCANNER,"Constant jamming, especially in duplex mode, very difficult to get the paper out of the machine once it jams."
1,Worst Scanner I have ever used,This scanner is horrible. It jams constantly when using the ADF. The OCR software they have included is useless.
5,HP Scanjet 5590 is an Excellent Buy,"The Scanner arrived within a few days of ordering with the plate glass broken. The return was so easy and Amazon was so accommodating - I received a new one within a couple days. The scanner is great for my small business use. Quality of documents and photos - and even slides - is excellent. The scanned images are easy to work with, edit and move around. Well worth the money."
2,When it works it's great,"The trouble is it is temperamental.I've had one of these for nearly two years, first one replaced under warranty - excellent service, running with Mac OS x 10.4.The problem seems to be with the drivers - last update July 2005 - and every day I have to reset the preferences file as I don't use the defaults and it forgets. Then I perhaps have to unplug unplug it, start again and if you're lucky away we go, usually alright for the rest of the day!At the moment it will only work on Automatic Feed, not single sheet.It works mechanically with my Windows xp system but there again I can't get pdfs out of it despite having full Acrobat -so back to the Mac. Not for the first time, I deleted all drivers and prefs & reloaded but no better. Ho hum new Fuji scanner beckons."
1,The document feeder is junk,"My office bought this for me -- it wasn't my idea. The flatbed scanner by itself is probably fine. The automatic document feeder (ADF), however, is non-functional. Perhaps it has fed pages satisfactorily TWICE since I started trying to use it. Otherwise, it has twisted pages and jammed them (perhaps 2 times) or, in the vast majority of cases, simply refused to feed the pages at all. I'm giving up and surplusing this piece of junk."
3,Difficult to use,"Noisy, unreliable, quality less than Canon has.For document scanning we replaced it by MicrotekArtixScan DI 1210."
4,HP ScanJet 5590,This replaced an older scanner. Works great and easy to install. The two sided feature is an added bonus from older model.
4,HP ScanJet 5590 Digital FlatBed Scanner,"Works very well, gives options for whatever you are scanning, uses several different formats. Scans are true to originals."
1,Worst scanner ever made,Installation was a nightmare. Constant problems with driver compatibility with other HP devices. The paper feeder jams on a regular basis. Overall a complete waste of money
1,"Disgusting, Distortive, Biased Propaganda","Ms. Bikel makes absolutely no effort to present the facts of the cases she examines in a balanced, accurate, and truthful manner. She deliberately suffuses her work with falsehoods and questionable statements recited as fact, and presents every contention made by her convicted subjects as the gospel (or better, perhaps, ""her gospel,"" from which she preaches quite broadly). The fact that police reports, investigative proceeds, eyewitness accounts, collateral witness statements, and court transcripts contradict these contentions seems to be of no issue to her. While it may be legitimate to debate the appropriateness of life sentences without the possibility of parole being given to young murderers, this documentary contributes nothing of value to that debate. A pronounced and self-proclaimed ideologue, Ms. Bikel brings her brand of blind, fact-averse advocacy to a topic that is actually much better treated without it."
1,Seller sent wrong item,I ordered the essential Acoustic Guitar DVD. I received essential Rock Guitar DVD in a essential Acoustic Guitar box. I did receive a full refund from Amazon after a series of emails to seller.
1,there's gotta be better options,"Do yourself a favor and buy a pair with padded grips. With good hand grips, you can do things like sit in front of your TV and after 2 minutes you forget you're even using it. Just becomes routine. With these however, I assure you there will not come a time when you forget these are in your hand. The strength of the grip is fine, it's just the handles that are uncomfortable. Adequate at best, but why settle for that?"
2,The handle really sucks,"The plastic handle is hard, and it hurts your palm. I don't like it, even though it is cheap."
4,Great Wrist Workout,Great value for two hand grips. They came with different resistances but it worked out well because when I grow out of the other I can use the harder one.
1,beware!!,"I have a number of vintage clothing books in my library and have been collecting vintage clothing and accessories for almost 20 years. This book is the only one I have regretted buying. Many of the ""illustrations"" are black and white drawings that explain color and cut. The descriptions are not adequate-there are few if any makers names listed and there's no index to help in the process of looking up an item. Many of the models that are used do not carry the clothing well and since the photographs are in black and white you cannot see the pieces properly. The one thing that I can say that's positive is that she does list the time periods for the items she shows, and she does pack many plates into her book."
2,Not for all of us -,"If you are looking for information on clothing between 1880 and about 1919, by all means, this is the book for you. But, if you're like me and you are looking for a book on clothing from 1930 on, pass this one up. More than 3/4 of this book is dedicated to victorian clothing. You can also tell which decades this author favors. While pictures of models (if you can really call these women models) in victorian clothing are carefully posed and accessorized, the more current clothing is slapped on just about anyone who would stand still long enough to have their picture taken. Example - the 60+ year old woman in the WEDDING DRESS. There are really no clothing from the 70s or 80s in this book and the 50s and 60s are very sparse. The prices are also unreasonably high for the average collector. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this book. But I do have to admit I did get a couple of giggles from some of the pitiful pictures."
3,"Overall, a bit disappointing","I have just started studying and researching vintage clothing. I did not find this book to be all that helpful. The value guide seems to be very high. Some of the pictures are interesting and the summaries at the beginning of the chapters are somewhat helpful, however, I feel there are better books available for research."
2,Better reference materials available,"I generally highly value my books on vintage clothing, however I gladly got rid of this book several years ago. It has some good basic information, but the values are very high and far too many of the illustrations are of items in period catalogs and magazines and not of actual garments. This may have been one of the first books on vintage clothing but it certainly is not one of the better ones."
2,"A good review for a final exam, but ...","I ordered this book hoping for a good *introduction* to calculus, with some intuitive explanations of some of the basic concepts of calculus. Instead, this book is meant to help a student solve problems correctly, without necessarily improving their understanding. The book's style is annoying - it's written in 1st person, and every page has lots of !!!'s. For example one chapter begins, ""The subject I beleive I teach better than anyone in the world is..."" The problem solving methods are clear and it will work for a review, but it wouldn't work for someone who had never seen the course, and I don't think it would help someone understand what calculus is all about."
1,This is awful.,"I don't know what planet miller is from, but it surely isn't one of a student. There are tons of other books out there to learn by besides this one. It is so hard to understand and the examples are just stupid. I am teaching myself calculus and I have found Calculus Made Easy and the Barron's calculus books to be much better. Of course, some of the best books can be found at your local library which were written in the early 1900s.This book is more designed to go along with classroom instruction, but it really isn't good at that either. I would not recommend this."
4,"Very good! If you want a starter cd of Rach, get this one!","Thibaudet is a fresh addition to the many recordings of Rach. I also own Cliburn and Ashkenazy recordings, and feels this adds a nice variety to the mix. The Paganini is outstanding, with the winds really stealing the show. Sonics are superb, as well as the feel for the hall's acoutsics. You will not feel cheated at all by this recording. On average, a must own!"
5,It is a gift!,"This was a gift for Christmas and as far as I know he is enjoying the book. The book arrived in a timely manner, actually sooner than I expected and was in time to be a gift."
5,Cosell and Ali-Media darlings,"Sound and Fury (14 hours, 11 cds, unabridged, Blackstone Audio) is a duel biography of Howard Cosell and Mohammed Ali.Sport writer Dave Kindred knew both men, he has written a bio that transcends his knowledge of both men. His text is an honest, no hold barred , warts and all biography. When a third person (like Kindred) writes a biography, he tends to put his personal touches with his own bias, this book is NOT that.The book showed an unlikely partnership created by media hype.In the audio narrative hands of Dick Hill, this audio project seems more like a docudrama in its scope. Hill's narrative voice takes on verbal personas of Cosell and Ali, without mocking them. His talent has grown from the days at Brilliance Audio.Sound and Fury is an amazing production . . . you won't forget it audio, long after you heard itBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,Based on a novel by Laveryl Spencer,"I am a huge Spencer fan. I found the movie to follow along with the book right up until the end. The ending was far different from that of the book, and I was very disapointed in the change. I also feel that the movie would loose all appeal to someone who had not read and loved the novel. Most of its appeal to me was seeing how the characters I already knew and loved were depicted on screen. There was really no pleasure in the film past that."
3,"Not great, but not bad","I've never been a huge fan of Renata Tebaldi but this album has such a wonderful selection that I had to buy it. The singing is very adequate but the recording quality is not great. If you're a fan, it's a must-have. For all others, buy it at your own risk."
2,Tebaldi has the bigger voice,"Yes, if you got Tebaldi in her vocal prime and Callas in her vocal prime to sing together on stage, the Italian would blow away the Greek with her enormous volume."
3,"Excellent, but Tebaldi was no Cher","Few singers have performed ""Tusca"" with the flourish and brilliance of Tebaldi, and her arias, filled with her rich, creamy, full-bodied voice are stunning even to this day. However, never have I seen anything from Tebaldi that even begins to compare with the eye-popping dance moves, bold vocal stylings, and see-through leotards of Cher. The works of Puccini are indeed fine; however I wager that fans of Tebaldi should--indeed MUST--indulge in classics like ""Do You Believe In Life After Love"" before considering their music collections complete."
4,What a voice!,"I heard Tebaldi many times at the Metropolitan, and no recording can truly give a full idea of the radiance of her voice at its best. It was an opulent, luscious sound, with a depth all its own. Her stage persona was charming and sympathetic, but ever-so-slightly aloof: she was a true diva in the original, untainted meaning of that Italian word: a ""goddess"" inhabiting her own special realm.This selection is drawn, with few exceptions, from her glory days in the 1950s, and includes some-but by no means all-of her finest moments on disc. While no recording can quite recreate her special aura, it CAN reproduce her way with a phrase, the exquisite light-and-shade of her personal style. In this she was a fine musical interpreter, and a real Italian: no heavy-breathing psychotics from Renata! Her heart, like the timbre of her voice, was full of Italy's sun.In the glorious tradition of Claudia Muzio, Tina Poli-Randaccio, Giannina Arangi-Lombardi, Maria Caniglia and Mafalda Favero."
5,Just what I expected,"The DVD was in perfect condition when it arrived, and I was also pleased that the price on Amazon was well below that of local stores. As for the product, the series is wonderful- a humorous twist on teenage crushes, and boasting 5 episodes for a single DVD is quite a bargain in itself."
1,Poorly compiled,"This is one of a multitude of semi-legal reissues of the Wailers early recordings, of which this is one of the worst. The original recordings from this pre-Island Records period are some of the best of Marley's career, but you would never know it from listening to them here. This 3 disc set could easily have fit onto 2 discs (each disc here is about 30 minutes), there are no track notes to explain dates or recording info, and some tracks are mislabeled and repeated. Additionally, the sound quality is terrible with a swishy, underwater sound on all tracks. The first disc of the ""Songs of Freedom"" box presents some of this same material in much, much better quality.Don't buy this."
4,Good sketching book,I liked that the author made the inside of a house a source for interesting sketches. Offers good basic skills information and makes you believe you can draw well.
3,It's okay,"Let me say first that i am a HUGE Garbage fan, and I absolutely worship Shirley Manson.However, I was really disappointed with this. To be honest, I only bought this because it came with 2 free singles (both versions of When I Grow Up, which I was also surprisingly disappointed with).The narrator guy starts to get annoying near the end, and there are a few boring bits (such as when some people on the phone talk for what seems like hours). I do, however, like the bits where Garbage themselves are talking, that's cool.Only get this CD if you really really need it."
2,great characters but to wordy.,"Well I liked this book to a point. The characters of Eden, the young, innocent, prim and proper lady, and Ram, the Highland Laird, who is fighting demons from his past are wonderful. Betina Krahn describes them beautifully. He must marry her to gain his inheritance and even though he is strongly attracted to her, as she is to him, he finds that his demons are coming between them. Her family is very enjoyable and add to the humor that is in this book. The only real complaint I have about this book was that it was a bit too wordy. It took me days and days to read. I would have liked it more if there had been a bit more action between the h/h. I just got bored with this book."
2,Bewilderment!,"I don't quite know what to say about this book except it was very strange and not in a good way. The story needed to be edited. Betina Krahn is usually a pretty solid writer, but this story seriously got away from her. Repetitious and boring to a fault, the entire book didn't know which direction it was going in. Her better books are ""The Husband Test"",""The Marriage Test"", and ""The Princess and the Barbarian"", and of course there's always Julie Garwood's ""The Prize"", my favorite male character of all time, Royce."
4,Search for Sasquatch,Our school has a Search for Sasquatch club. While the club is mostly in fun and for socializing the club wants to add validity to their purpose and seek out the scientific side of the club. This book was purchased to look at the possibilities of Sasquatch and this with other sources is being studied to help with our research.
1,very poor,"Although I believe the majority of the cast are truly trying to find Sasquatch, I thought the video as a whole was very poor. The music was so loud I had to turn the volume way down while the narrating was so faint I had to turn it way up. They spent more time explaining the equipment they were going to use then anything else. At the end, it states ""to be continued"". I wouldn't watch any continuation if you paid me. The only thing it had going for it was some of the music was kind of nice, and of course, the few actual shots of the forest were beautiful."
3,Not a lot of sasquatch material,"It has some good points, and the scenery is great, but the pace is slower than others I have seen."
1,This video was so bad!!!,"I wish I could rate this as a quarter of a star. It was horrible, boring, hard to watch, and non informative. The voices are so low that you have to turn the volume up and then the music is so loud (sounds like bad porn music) that you have to turn the volume back down. I never give bad reviews, but this video is a waste of time, I'm glad I rented it and did not waste my hard earned money to buy this waste of a dvd."
1,worst bigfoot documentary ever,"i have watched and purchased countless bigfoot documentaries. this is by far the worst one ever. first the audio quality was terrible. then they offered no re-enactments or real eye witness accounts. lastly, they showed ONE questionable photo which looked like a black blob in the woods. no videos of the creature or suspected creature either. the dvd basically has a few men mumbling about how they will set up cameras and use night vision. oh they did show the same photos/video of deer and other wildlife...wow! do not waste your money. extremely disappointed!"
2,On the Track,I have dozens of Bigfoot dvd's. This one was packaged very nicely but it is as 'homemade' as it gets. The sound quality is very poor. It is squatchers recording squatchers. A lot of talking. Nothing much compelling. I appreciate the work that goes into the search and hobby but it was a bit tedious to sit through.
3,"Returned, but extremely great service","I purchased this for a Halloween costume and it was not the quality I was looking for. As a dress up, imagination toy it would have been great.The customer service, however, was FANTASTIC!!!!I received it very fast and had no problem returning it.I was emailed that the credit was applied to my card within 2 days. Great service and I will have no problem doing business with them again! Thank you!"
3,Good book but not enoug information,"Bryan Perrett is a good writer, most of his book I have read, however the one writing as “encyclopedia” are not a good as the book written from the military and Soldiers point of view, overall I will recommend most of his book for an informative and riveting historical reading."
1,"Didn't work, POC","This is so cheap it seems like a bargain, but guess what... ??it didn't work at all!! And its too much trouble to send it back...Caveat emptor!"
5,I like this little Battery Tester.,I bought this battery tester in Sept'08 from Amazon.I like it so far.- The small size is nice. I keep it in the same storage box as my batteries.- The design is nice. I like how the testing arm is part of the protective case until you use it.- The usability is good. Easy to use. I trained my 6 year old son how to use it and now he periodically he tests and gets rid of all the depleted batteries.My Overall rating: 5 out of 5 stars. Good quality and usability for the price. Helps to ensure my battery supply has all the bad batteries weeded out from it.I hope you find my review helpful.
4,what's not to love??,"Economically priced, simple, never needs batteries, saves me money by knowing what batteries to toss and which to keep. (Also saves lots of aggravation.) I love this little sucker! Woulda gave it 5 stars but gave it 4 as it was not USA made I don't think."
4,"Handy, Great for the price!","Got two. One worked out of the box.The other had a solder joint inside that was not connected, so it only worked on 9 volt batteries. It was very easy to open the case with no tools and see where the wires belong. It worked fine for all battery types after re-soldered. The case snapped easily back together.Very handy for wide variety of batteries. No battery needed for the meter."
3,Does the job,"It seems to give accurate readings however, it is not the easiest device to use. It can be difficult to hold the battery in one hand while pressing the lever with the other hand to open the device and insert the battery. I do not have any hand issues and frequently have trouble. I can only imagine how this may be difficult for someone with arthritis or hand tremors."
2,Below average tester.,"I bought this and some other model of battery tester to replace one I had a long time that got too old. This tester was the more expensive of the two, but worked worse. It is awkward to use and produces inconsistent results that often dont consistently show if the battery is clearly good or bad. Buy another model."
1,Not impressed.,This has not worked for us at all. Would return but its not worth the hassle. I do not recommend buying!
5,Works for Me,"I just needed something that was capable of testing batteries laying around the house. I wasn't looking for a load bearing test (which is the most accurate of testers) This is good for people that want to check whether or not the batteries will be good for use within household electronics, but if you need something for professional use, this is not you tester. as other have stated. Mine came black instead of blue.Pro:Simple TesterMultiple battery types can be tested.Cons:Cheap construction (kind of expected though for $4)color not portrayed correctly on product listing."
3,Self-powered battery tester,Of the 3 battery testers I bought this is the 2nd easiest to use. The oblique clamping of the battery during test is difficult to maintain.
1,not good,This product is useless. Almost all of my rechargeables showed 'good' when the battery's actually dead. It only shows recharge for disposable alkaline batteries that are totally dead.
2,Measures SOMETHING - but what? and resolution so-so,"This is supposed to test your batteries for good/replace-Recharge.On the good side - it is small, and does SOMETHING.On the not-so-good side1. WHAT does it measure? this is not clear. There is no manual, and thescale is unlabeled. I am *assuming* it measures voltage, but I have noclue if this is under some sort of load or not, and so the results arenot very convincing2. If it DOES mesure Voltage, this is not so good for RechargeableBatteries, as they only give out 1.2V even when fully charged.2. The scale has strange proportions, with more than 2/3rd of it for ""bad""and only about 20% for ""Good"". This is not very useful."
2,Inaccurate reading if not exactly placed,"Pro: tests many sizes of dry cell batteries. Inexpensive. Can give accurate reading if you correctly position the battery.Con: Tester contacts have to be exactly placed on the battery and it may take two or three tries to be sure. For each reading, the needle swings back and forth so you have to be patient and wait for it to stop moving."
4,Nifty Item,"This is a great size, works pretty good, just wish it was a little more precise with the needle not fluctuating..but definitely worth it."
1,Doesn't work properly,"Immediately after taking it out of the package, it worked intermittently. Sometimes it shows the battery charge level, other times, the needle barely moves from the rest position (even with brand new batteries). At this price, it's not worth the effort to return it."
4,very easy,"this is the device that you can have in a handy-man bag. this batterie tester couldent get much easyer to use, simply clamp the batterie in and an instant reading of power remaining. this can tell me if my smoke alarms need to be changed with out having to go by whats recommended. must have for anyway who's tiered of throwing away money that could be thrown away."
2,Cheesy ergonomic mess,"Looks like it is designed to flip the arm up with the thumb with one hand while holding battery with the other.Good Luck!Otherwise it does the job, but afraid to drop it while struggling to get it open with one hand. It will probably explode into 1000 pieces on contact with the floor.I got this also and prefer it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I1E1LG/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00"
5,Great little item,"I bought one of these because I prefer to use rechargeable batteries and was always getting the charged and discharged batteries mixed up. This little gadget was cheap, is easy to use, and works great. I like it so much I bought a couple more to give as gifts. The recipients love it too. You can't beat the price; if it saves you from tossing a couple of good batteries, it's already paid for itself."
3,It's cheap,its decent but not what i was thinking it was gonna do it sucks when testing Rechargeable batteries the tester shows bthem on the yellow line when there fully charged
1,Not accurate,"This tester shows ""good"" (at about 25% of the good scale) for a battery that dimly illuminates a flashlight. A new battery reads about 75% of the good scale. To me, the battery that won't light the flashlight bulb brightly should not read good. It should read ""low"" or ""replace"". Not a very useful tool."
1,"It works, just not very well","Pros: It's cheap and it does work.Cons: 1. The meter needle bounces all over the place, like a bouncing ball. It gives a reading but you have to hold the battery and wait 15 seconds or so for the needle to settle.Cons: 2. The lever for making contact with the battery is awkward and frequently loses contact. Combined with the bouncing needle problem it's very annoying.Spend a few more bucks and get something better."
5,Uncomplicated,"Terribly uncomplicated, compact design, no bells and whistles, does just what you need it to do, without requiring its own power source. You can carry it in a camera case."
3,compact and easy,"I like this little meter very much. especially the cost and the small size. It is a little difficult to keep the arm up while inserting the battery but all and all good. I have used on AA,AAA, D, and C"
5,easy to use,I had one of these a long time ago. I lost mine after years of being bounced around and finaly lost. It's easy to use and the kids are always useing and losing it.
2,Very basic tester,This product will tell you if your battery is alive or dead but nothing about the battery's ability to power your device.
5,Simple but important,Helps me to recycle batteries and finally I don't need to guess about a specific battery.
3,Decent little Tester,It s alittle jumpy if you don't have the perfect connection but it reads the batteries fine. I have had it for about 4 weeks now.
1,Inaccurate as it does not test under load,"The problem with this battery tester is that it only checks for voltage remaining in a battery. Even a 90% used battery can show nearly full rated voltage. It is only when a load is placed on the battery that a true assessment is possible.For example, a dead alkaline battery and a fully charged rechargable battery (NiMH full charge = 1.2 volts) both read the same low (yellow).Look for one of the more expensive units that tests under load."
1,Does *not* load test batteries - Buy a load tester.,"I bought this product to test rechargeable batteries for my camera, wireless mouse, etc.Although the batteries were nearly depleted, this tester still detected voltage and indicated that the batteries were ""GOOD"".This tester doesn't detect *how much* remaining charge is in the battery. It just detects if *any* charge is left in the battery.Do you want to go out with 1/2 charged batteries and not know it? Check the specifications on battery testers to make sure they put a sample load on the battery. That provides a clear indication of remaining battery life."
2,indicator not accurate and a little tricky to hold,"This battery tester is not very accurate. Most of the AA batteries that I test fall under the good range, even when it needs to be recharged.It is also a little tricky to clamp battery being tested.I am not satisfied with this product."
2,Radio Shack version poorly calibrated,"I bought the Radio Shack version of this -- looks exactly the same. It indicates batteries are ""good"" even when the batteries no longer have enough charge for the device or piece of equipment. I really like the design; I wish it were more accurate."
3,Save on shipping,"Radio shack sells the same product for the same price, so just buy it there and save on the shipping cost."
1,Junk!!!!,"Measures Voltage only. This is no way to check a Battery's state of charge. Buy something like ""Delkin Devices DD/BATTEST MULTI RoHS AA/AAA Battery Power Tester"", it really Rocks!"
2,Cheap and so so good,"Awkard to use, doesn't ever show full charged batteries, which may be my batteries because that's the reason I bought it, was to test out a batch of them I bought from ebay, that didn't work in my camera."
4,Good product,Good product. I save money and energy by knowing what is left in the battery. Easy to use and small enough that it doesn't take much space to store. Works well with most sets of the popular sizes of batteries you would use. I would buy it again knowing what I have experienced with this battery tester. But why is all this stuff always seem to be made in China. I'd pay a bit more pennies if I could find one made here in the states. C'mon America wake up
1,"Shows all disposable batteries as good, even when they're dead.","When I received this item I tested it on approximately twenty-five dead batteries I had in my ""to-recycle"" bin. According to this device, every single one of the batteries--removed from various remotes, smoke alarms, etc--were completely ""good"". Avoid this item, it is useless."
5,Looking to Save Money,"I purchased this tester to help me save money. It was only five dollars, and most of the time when you are going to change the batteries in a product it actually doesn't need all new batteries. Sometimes just one is bad."
