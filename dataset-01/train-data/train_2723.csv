2,Loved the show and the first movie but this is blah for me,"The ending gets better, but it's slow and lost my interest in parts. Really just not up to the hype or the rest of the series reputation."
2,This Ones No Fun,"Boy, I sure wanted to like this movie. I wanted that fun, sassy vibe that Sex and the City is known for. But the first movie wrapped things up so sufficiently that it really didn't leave room for any sequels. The writers did a good job trying to make this thing work, but everything that was cool about the series was actually a turn-off in this movie."
1,This movie is awful,"I wanted to watch a fun, light hearted movie and what I got was a tedious, bad acted, travesty of film making that caters to shallow consumerism and sexual free for all with no point. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed Sex and the City and liked (not loved) Sex and the City I, but II is an embarrasment for everyone involved in it including me who paid to watch it. Carrie Bradshaw should grow up. I no longer care about the character after this horrble film."
1,"Loved the series, Movie 1 was good... This is a stinker!","The series was wonderful... I have all 6 seasons on dvd AND the first movie. What happened here? Someone told them ""forget the writing... we want bigger, far fetched storylines and flash! Lets pretend that these 4 women have more money than GOD.""I spent most of this movie rolling my eyes at what they were trying to get away with. I wanted a feel good story line, one that I could relate to! All I got was nonsense and a lot of ""Are ya kiddin' me?"""
2,This movie stinks...,"They're all too self absorbed rubbing their wealth and cultural insensitivity in our faces. The best parts of the movie and the only two thing that stopped me from giving this piece of dreck only one star were Alice Eve's unrestrained breasteses and Liza Minnelli doing her thing. Other than that they are ALL spoiled, self indulgent, rude and why does Cynthia Nixon always look like she's got green teeth?"
2,Meh,"I was a big fan of the show, and I enjoyed the first movie.I was not a big fan of this movie though. I did not like the way it portrayed Big and Carrie's marriage. Carrie is upset that they don't go out to fancy restaurants all the time. When Big comes home with takeout she gets upset. I just can't believe how much money is being tossed around without a second thought. Eating out, getting takeout every day, that's so expensive, especially in NYC. And I hated Carrie's reaction to Big wanting to relax at home. Not every day has to be spent out partying and getting drunk. What's wrong with cuddling on the couch? It doesn't mean you're in a rut, or that you're boring as she implies. And Big asking to spend 2 days apart every week? for me that would be the end of the marriage"
1,"please, please, please",Please don't make number 3. Not even the fashion could save number 2. Let the divas age alone. Thank you.
1,There is a reason why there are as many 1 star ratings as 5 star,"and 50% is a failing grade.This was one of the most atrocious films I have ever seen - karoke, camels and calling a cab by showing your legs in a foreign country and a whole lot of things you have to suspend intelligence to believe - ladies of SATC, how far you have fallen. I dont know if the writers ran out of time, ideas - both? but I have to think that at some point someone said - this really is bull, but fans will still eat it up, let's make some money!If you really love SATC, watch some series DVDs, even watch the first Sex and the City - it's 10 times better than this one, and I only gave it 3 stars. Don't waste your time or money on this. I wish I had not."
1,Dreadful and Disappointing,"First, the writing in this movie is dreadful. The acting is dreadful. The plot is dismal. The wardrobe is over the top, not in a good way. The stars, except for Cynthia Nixon (Miranda), look long past their expiration date -- more so than the supposedly 8 year gap suggested by the plotline. Don't get me wrong, they're still attractive, but Sarah Jessica Parker is developing a proclivity for unattractively-styled too-long hair plus Ruth Buzzi's massive chin; Kim Cattrell is fighting the inevitable thickening that comes with age; and Kristin Davis is beginning jawline droop. They're kittens no longer, but the dialogue and the plotline suggest they are. It doesn't work.This movie proves the truth in the statement ""We can't go home again."" I'd rather live with my many, many happy memories of this delightful TV series, thank you."
4,Excellent Little Mouse at a Great Price,"The Labtec optical mouse has a nice feel in the user's hand. It is not too obtrusive or over-round and the fingers settle quite nicely on the mouse buttons.The scroll wheel is a nice addition but is set in the mouse further than usual. This has its ups and downs. On the positive side, the scroll wheel does not protrude clumsily from the mouse. On the other hand, it does take some getting used to and slows the pace of scrolling.The optical eye is smaller than I have seen on an optical mouse. Again, on the positive side, the small eye slows down the mouse movement such that the pointer does not go careening around the screen. On the down side, some people may like that feature in their mouse.As for the construction, it does not feel like the most sturdy mouse out there but I suppose if you don't smack it around like a hockey puck, it should last you just fine."
2,"Nice cup, but its hard to drink out of","This record reminds me of an old souvenir cup I used to have. It was shaped like a giant molar, and it was cute to look at, but it leaked when you drank out of it. So it really wasn't a good cup at all. Anyway, this album has interesting music on almost every song, and its nicely varied. However, the vocals are so grating that it is rendered unlistenable. If the same set was done by a moderately interesting singer it would be an important record. As it is, it will never come out of my CD rack. Ever."
2,Could Have Been Better,"In Lafangey Parindey, The movie was made well with good screenshots and a good plot. even the cast that was Deepika Padukone & Neil Nitin Mukesh were pretty good, however there were a few setbacks in the film. The story was somewhat stretched and N.N.Mukesh couldnt play the role of a rowdy or 'lafanga' perfectly. the same goes for Deepika. Even the dialogues were a little cliched. but all in all it was a good bollywood movie with scope to have don eso much better."
3,It fit; it works,It works; it's supposed to work. Selecting from the myriad of available tapes was confusing. Here are the 5 more words needed to finally get rid of this review.
5,Brother Label Tape,I have purchased several brother label tapes (all black print on white background)and like them all. Read other reviews to avoid wasting a lot of tape each time you print a label.
3,wasted tape,Great product but its sure a waste of tape with 1/2 inch of extra tape on every print. can't someone send this to Japan and design it right?
3,Purchased as new; actually used,"I purchased The Step F1080 High Step and it was delivered in a timely fashion. The DVD inside had no clear wrapper indicating a new product, the outside DVD case was broken and missing the entire top section. DVD inside plays fine. Right out of the box the bottom step had a collection of dust and floor dirt ground into the four rubber/plastic floor cushions...obviously already been used on somebody's dirty floor. Although Clorox disinfecting wipes cleared up any dirt issues with the step, the broken DVD case (with the broken pieces completely missing from the box so it wasn't broken in transit) makes me a little less confident in the merchandise I might buy in the future. The step works fine, the DVD works fine. I just don't think I got a brand new product."
1,Box did not include what it was suppose to,"I, too, received the Muscle endurance VHS tape and NOT the Cathe Step DVD. Very frustrated. I was then told that I would only have a 50/50% chance of receiving the correct dvd. How can that be right?"
1,DVD wouldn't play,"UGH, the High Step Circuit DVD by Cathe wouldn't play at all. It totally gobbed up and stuttered through out first playing. I cleaned it off, but no help. I have lots ofCathe DVD's and use my computer and DVD player all the time for them. The DVD wasn't in shrink wrap, I don't know if it was used (it didn't look scratched) or just defective. : ( for me. I was really looking forward to this, but the hassle of sending back a High Step? I will pass. I just was looking forward to the bonus of the high step DVD included in the package. I can't even figure out how to contact Amazon without promising to return it. Hazard of online shopping."
4,"Great step, defective video","I am very happy with the high step, however the video doesn't run. I have tried cleaning it, but nothing changed. I can't figure out how to contact anyone to get this taken care of. I seems a waste to return the step when only the video is defective."
2,"Great step, defective DVD","Like some other customers who have purchased this product since June, 2011, I also had a problem with the High Step and DVD. The first one I received looked used and had a defective DVD that was not wrapped. I returned it and ordered another one. It was also scuffed and the DVD would not play in any computer in my house. I decided that the scuffs must be from rubbing the box during shipping and that the DVD probably wasn't shrink wrapped. I didn't think that Amazon should have to keep paying the return shipping costs for a defective product, and I really wanted the High Step with the DVD. After searching around online for the DVD, I ended up going to the Cathe.com site and downloading a digital copy of the DVD. I burned a copy and put in the case. It cost me $9.97. Now I have the High Step and a DVD that works. I would have given it 4-5 stars, but having to pay extra for the DVD lowered my rating."
5,Misissippi Girl,"I recieved the High step in today and very excited to start using it. I already own the original step which is the larger version and I love it. The only thing about this package is that the DVD was used and I was dissappionted because it stated that it was new. Overall I would recommend this product if you are a Cathe Fredrich fan...I also needed extra risers and they were a little pricey, so when I got my high Step the risers fit my large Step perfectly. So now I don't have to purchuse the extra risers. Happy with my purchase!"
4,Good stepper,"Ordered for PT clinic. Initially thought it was a wide one with the gap in the middle, but what you see is the width. It still works well, will get the job done. Haven't looked at the video though."
3,Very Disappointed Customer,"I love the step because I can use it on any exercise I choose to do on my own but I was very disappointed at the dvd that came with it. The dvd was not wrapped in the plastic wrap at all and whenever I placed it in the dvd player it constantly freezes and skips throughout the entire program. I haven't made it all the way through the entire dvd because it freezes so bad. I would love to be able to do the exercise that go a long with the step, which is one reason I purchased the step, but the cd quality is very poor. I wouldn't recommend to anyone and would not purchase from here again."
4,Great accessory,"I love the fact that this is something that will vary my workouts. I work out and home and bought the Cathe pyramid lower and upper body workout DVD and love it! I have not used the DVD that came along with the step but look forward to using it to change up the workout. I will also buy another Cathe workout DVD because I especially love doing weights while watching others work out and so that I can use the step more to achieve my awesome better and firmer buns and thighs. Cathe and her friends are such in good shape this will keep you motivated to want to get in shape like them, plus the cast is diverse which to me was a plus."
3,Gift,This was a gift for a friend so I never had a chance to use it. They had no complaints so I always give them three stars.
5,Classis Sports Biography book,I enjoy reading all of Matt Christopher's books because they are fun to read while at the same time discuss interesting topics. This book was especially interesting. It is a sports biography about the famous baseball player Sammy Sosa. At the Plate With Sammy Sosa is a great book because it goes from all the hardships Sammy faced from his childhood in the Dominican Republic through his early years as a pro when he wasn't very popular to now when he is an international icon. This really is a great book especially for a younger audience.
5,The Action Gamepad by Logitech,"This is a excellent game pad for its price. Once I took it out of its box and held it I liked the feel of it in my hands. It feels like an Nintendo 64 controller but with sega gensis type buttons on the front. This pad is good for people with big or small hands, because I like it and so does my 12 year old little brother.Installing this pad was great. All I did was put the disk in, and in ten minutes without a problem I was playing. This pad has worked with my emulators and all the games I have used it on.The only problem I have had with this pad is its (8-way)d-pad. When I frist started using the d-pad I would go down/up + left/right when i just wanted to go left/right. After playing for a an hour I got used to it and can control the d-pad fine. My brother went through this process to.If you want a good [inexpensive] pad this is it.Happy Gaming"
2,review,the size them claim for the measurement is incorrect no way did it expand to 40inches i would not oreder it again
4,Fun Lego toy,Length:: 1:26 MinsThis is a brief video showing you our Lego Chum Bucket. Hope you like it!
1,Poopy Face :(,"Monster Inc makes me a sad panda. I cannot believe someone would pay $1500 bucks for a ""Voltage Stabilizer."" Otherwise known as a resistive load.Always be sure to consult your friendly local electrical engineer before you waste your money on Monster products.OMGWTFBBQKTHXBAI!!!!"
5,Absolutely Perfect,"It doesn't get a smidgen better than this. On their 2nd and last album, the dB's smoothed out every wrinkle in their production and songwriting. The jangle is still there, but in place of the spare arrangement and shrill quirkiness of Stands for Decibels (which are enjoyable in their own right) is a welcome polish. The hit, ""Amplifier"", is not to be missed."
4,Sex Differences and More,"From the perspective of behavioral ecology, Low explores human sex differences. She shows why females specialize in parental effort and males in mating effort. She examines the implication of this difference, in combination with ecology, to understand mating systems, mate choice, fertility, coalitions, warfare and a host of other topics. Much of the evidence presented takes the form of statistical summaries of cross-cultural summaries; short summaries of other societies are also included. The book contains a considerable amount of information, is enjoyable to read, thought-provoking (I'm still puzzling over the factoid of a 137male/100 female sex ratio at birth in a human population) but not sensational. The book may not leave the reader with a firm grasp on the diversity existing within male and female behavior, respectively, but will make great sense of the statistical differences which exist between males and females throughout the world."
2,A book with to many numbers and figures,"I bought this book to learn some interisting new facts that I have not heard about before. Well this book didn't do that. Most of the stuff in this book I have read in other places and it was written better. Like The ""Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley & ""Why is Sex Fun"" by Jarod Diamond.This book relies to heavely on statistical data to come up with anything very interisting. I found myself skipping complete pages and chapters because of the boredom for having to read to many statistics.If you are looking to use this book as a resource to quote statistics about sex then you are in good shape, this book will give you plenty of that. Other wise i recomend that you stir clear of this book."
3,Not a big fan,I have owned many different bag gloves in my life and these are the worst. The wrist support isn't that great and the padding over the knuckles is inferior to other bag gloves made by Everlast makes. Stiff and lacking wrist support.
4,"Great padding, poor velcro","These are my first heavy bag gloves and they do the job well. I have since bought three other pairs of gloves, each more expensive than the last and these are still my goto gloves because they are comfortable and light. They hurt my hands the least out of all my gloves. Wriststrap velcro is very low quality, but I can live with it for the price. The synthetic material is holding up remarkably well despite my constant abuse. I give them only 4 stars because the velcro is cheap and they do not breath well and therfore get pretty smelly."
2,2nd time ordered...item does not match picture...help!!!!!!,"I would give this item 4 stars if I had received what was pictured on the page. Instead the item received was Black with WHITE lining around the wrist strap and EVERLAST written on the wrist strap. There was a ""E"" above the EVERLAST on the glove that looks Tribal. I am 5'7' and weigh 170lbs with average hands and L/XL fits really well. But,right now I am upset that I didn't get the correct item. Please post the correct picture Amazon. Thanks."
4,Decent Pair of Gloves!,"While these aren't the best pair of bag gloves you can buy, they are what you should expect for the price. Also, the description says that they're lightweight bag gloves, this means they should be used with focus mitts, speed bags, or lighter heavy bags. They could be used for mixed martial arts as well; however, they're a little stiff in the fingers for that. I used them with hand wraps and they worked well."
4,Petrine Ministry: Catholics And Orthodox In Dialogue,"I gained a great deal of insight into the workings of both the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Churches in the area of unification. The setting was a conference held at the Vatican attended by scholars from both the east and the west. Although not empowered to formulate church policy, the group was committed to offering scholarly assistance to those who are in the position to make decisions. Both sides of different issues dealing with the acncient role of St. Peter were presented in a fair and objective fashion. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Christian unification."
5,FANTASTIC ACTION,THIS IS A GREAT TALE OF SLAUGHTER AND REVENGE WITH SOME OF THE BEST NINJA FIGHT SCENES EVER. A MOVING AND DRAMATIC MOVIE WITH MUCH ACTION AND EXCITEMENT
5,a must read,"if you've decided to open up that can of worms that is sports psych, then you really should read this gem. it is vastly superior to all his other books."
3,Mostly information for Beginners,This book is for people who are new to the concepts of databases. It is very basic so OOP is not covered. I found it too easy. I could compare to the User guide that ships with Visual Foxpro.
2,vague,"this book was a big dissapointment for the money spent. Has step by step pictures showing processes but the captions underneath the pictures are vague often leaving you with questions that this book can't offer. Barely touches the steps for developing film that has been pushed/ pulled. I would look for a different book if I had to do it all over again. Some sections are decent, but the majority is not and I would look into a different book."
5,A historically accurate cartoon!,"If you want your kids to be entertained, buy Disney's Pocahontas. If you want them to be entertained AND educated - go for this one instead. DVD includes internet link and fun comprehension quizzes."
4,No b-sides but an exclusive remix and a superb logo,"Now that the two Somewhere singles are out-of-print and out-of-stock, this Japanese import EP is the only available CD with this song. The b-sides to the singles are unfortunately not included, however there is an exclusive remix (not found on the singles) which is well worth listening to, one of the two best mixes of the song in my opinion (the other one being also featured in Bilingual Limited... while supplies last). A bit pricey, but over 55 minutes of music. Includes lyrics. And a superb logo on the cover, probably one of the best graphic art ever to be on a PSB sleeve."
5,Do it yourself for big bucks!,"The author wisely plays down her own experiences in favor of those from well-known hunters of both whitetail and mule deer trophy bucks. Although Kathy Etling has written for most of the major outdoor magazines in the U.S. and is a staff writer for several of them, her real strength lies in the way she is able to get straight to the point in an interview. She cuts to the chase and reveals what any hunter needs to know in order to take trophy-class deer. Whether you're planning on going with an outfitter or going on your own, Etling gives you information enough to succeed. Yet she never loses sight of hunting's essence: that a trophy lies in the eyes of the beholder. So, while a 130 point Boone and Crockett whitetail is a fine animal indeed, it may not be what the long-time whitetail fanatic is looking for. Etling manages to provide information to satisfy every hunter who longs to put a nice -- or record book -- trophy on his or her wall."
3,Middle of the road stick,"I bought this stick with great expectations and was really disappointed. I'll try to be informative.- Stick is too loose, even with power to the stick. Too much play before the stick actually registers movement.- Tried increasing tension of stick with the utility and it doesn't help.- The effects were solid, but once again making any accurate/fine movements with the stick is impossible.Maybe this would be a good supplemental stick, I don't think it's fit for duty as your main gaming stick. I ended up with a Sidewinder Precision Pro 2. Now that's a good stick."
5,adds so much more to the experience,"love this thing! adds so much more to the flight simulator experience. multiple setting options you can you control, the feedback is realistic and scaled proportionally. quality is good. can never go back to 'keyboard' flying again!"
1,Why I Didn't Get It,"I ordered this DVD on April 13 of last year from the ""Why We Bang"" website. Never got it. It might be a good documentary. I don't know."
1,Distorted view of the greatest country singer of all time.,"I have read this book and was shocked at not only what was in the book, but what was left out of it. The author seems to have been more interested in Eddy Arnold then in Jim Reeves. This book does not by any means tell the full story. Jim deserves credit for what he did for country music and this book doesn't cut it."
1,Biased Portrayal of a Great Singer,"This ""biography"" published about Jim Reeves is extremely derogative and bears little resemblance to the man I knew and traveled with on several tours. The author's portrayal of Jim's relationship with Mary or the Blue Boys was a deliberate attempt to tear down Jim Reeves for the author's own purposes and not published until Mary was in a nursing home unable to defend either Jim or herself (For example, I was with Jim when he discovered an airline had broken the neck of his guitar, and was he angry? Absolutely YES, but did he lose his cool? NO!! So much for his supposedly bad temper.) My suggestion is to acquire a new biography now in the final phases of editing which should be published this Fall. (2009) The name of this book will be, ""JIM REEVES: HIS UNTOLD STORY"" by Larry Jordan. [...]"
1,About Eddy Arnold,"A Book about Jim Reeves would have been nice, since that is what the cover implied."
3,A new book.,"I have read the book, and indeed found it to be a fine read, reading the reviews todate, I can fully understand their views, some are heated to say the least! but could I just advise you all a new book has just been published by Mr Larry Jordon ""Jim Reeves, His untold story. I am hoping Amazon here in the U.S and in the United Kingdom will stock it, it has well over 600 plus pages and is a must for all Jims fan like myself, please keep on at Amazon to stock this wonderful book if agreeable with Mr Jordon. The music world needs this book, because there will never be another Jim Reeves ever again. I am writing this review from England Regards to you all Gary."
3,Jim Reeves,Quite a good read with a lot of historical data but doesnt provide a lot of insight into the character of this great singer. This could well be due to the passage of time making it hard to find people who really knew him. I would liked to have read more about what was life like on the road with Jim Reeves and surely there are better quality photos available.But nonetheless worth a read for fans.
3,Producto recibido - Falta probar y practicar,"Te indica las posibles opciones con las que puedes realizar un spare... Me falta probar en cancha. Listo y probado, excelente guía para mi que soy principiante jejejej saludos y gracias"
3,Not as good as the first Tiger,"This game is decent. However, it seems to be developed for a younger player. Those that enjoyed Tiger '99 will not find this game as exciting or challenging. (Not that the '99 was very challenging), but this game lacks even the skill used to dominate in '99. New courses always excite a player, but in this version it is not worth it. The career mode is kind of cool, but the overall play is about the same, wait for Tiger to grow up another year before purchasing a game he endorses."
2,don't waste your money,"This game looked promising however it was disappointing. Very similar to Tiger Woods 99 which I own. Not enough golfers to begin with and what would have made sense since this is a game geared for kids why didn't they create as minature golf course, now that would have been a cool twisted. One feature I did like is the ""contour screen"" showing the dips and slopes of the green or course. That made it easier to lineup the shots an gauge the amount of power was neccesary. Worth a rental, but even bored my 7 year old son."
3,slow,"tiger woods has to make a golf game that you can play in less then a hour, this game takes an hour and a half for two people to finish a round"
2,An incredible performance,"Owning almost all of Cecil Taylors recorded output, it is difficult to pinpoint one high point. This is it though. A continous performance lasting just over one hour with J. Lyons, Raphe Malik, Marc Edwards and the incredible David S. Ware. Strong soloing and ensemble passages throughout it sometimes becomes a challenge to find where solo's and individual thoughts cease and ensemble notated work begins. Being a 1976 performance this also serves as a prelude to the wonderful recordings that David s. Ware would go on to record as a leader with his own bands. Highly recommended and challenging music that bears repeated listening and investigation."
5,Great Appetizer,"This book gives professionals and students an excellent introduction and overview on clicks and mortar, on analysis of opportunities, development of marketing and branding strategies and on planning, implementation and control of marketing programs. There is a focus on the traditional marketing process and there are good examples on many topics in the book."
3,An OK game,"Let me start out by saying that I have played a few FPS's on the PS2 and this was one of the worst. I mainly rate a game on how much fun it really is and although BF 2:MC is fun in the beginning, the game eventually gets boring and tedious. One cool feature of the game is the ability to swap places with different members of your squad but other than that the game offers nothing much to the table. The original Battlefield games on the PC were really good and that was the reason I got this game. If you are looking for a game that lasts a few hours with repetitive (although initially fun) gameplay, with one of the better graphics on the PS2 then this might be the kind of game for you. If you are looking for a good FPS on the PS2 get Black (one of the best shooters on the console) or the SOCOM games, both of which are more fun to play."
5,Awesome Game,"first off I'm not really Elsine Reid, thats my moms name. k for the review, I got this game at a gamestop in the mills, and it is kick ass. the hotswapping feture is pretty cool, but my favorite things the detonation mines. I've never played online yet, but I don't have a network adapter, kinda pisses me off. But this game is awesome and I got it for $10"
4,great online game.......,"I had mixed feelings towards this game, ill start off with the game its self. I would only buy this game if you have online, and if you dont have online and you think that the singler player stinks then your missing out. What im trying to say is that you cant judge this game just on the singler player, which by the way is so in so. If you dont play this game online then your missing out big time!!!! The graphics are some of the better graphics you will see on the ps2. Another thing is that the game feels just a little to arcadly for my taste after playing socom. The levels are great but people are to crazy over badstab, because after the level for the 10th time in a row it will get pretty boring. But all the levels are fun.The game gets just a little boring after awhile but still fun. Buy this game for 29.99 nothin else, a game store tryed to sell this game to me for 50 dollars."
4,a bit let down...,"I feel a bit let down by the game. I haven't played online or the PC version of the game but the PS2 comes off as a standard FPS game. The controls were the main problem. Other than helpful hints now and then there is no place for your control schematics. You cannot customize them either. (note to game designers: make sure you put a slot in the menu titled ""Controls"" and with a little diagram so I know how to use them) The vehicles are also difficult to use, no hints on how to fly the helicopter. Jumping, crouching and turning are also slow, not like the days of Unreal and Quake for making movement like heck. You also can't communicate with your other team members, at least in single player. Maybe when I get online it might be more fun."
4,Excellent online play - actually game is so-so,"I would definately recommend this game to anyone...especially if you have capable online play. I would play all night if i could, on the online play as you go through rankings. The vehicles are way fun and easy to useThe regular game is not nearly as fun once you play online and its really easy. This is the first war game i've ever had and i have finished missions with great ease (the controls are easy to remember). Also, it kind of cheap, I was by myself hiding behind a car and ran into the middle of the road to shoot some other hiders(about 10) and i only got hit once or twice every 10 or so seconds and trust me, that is a long time. In ten seconds you could kill about 3 people with enough ammo.The online play is more realistic and sniping is SO much fun.anywayz i recommend this to most gamers except hard-core war gamers."
3,Realistic,"This is a realistic Tank Game , rated a RPG Game. If you like rpg , the you'll Love this game."
2,Waste,"This game doesnt even compare to battlefield 1942 for PC. game play is dissapointing to say the least. After about an hour of the same old thing, this game gets a little old. Great for entertaining nephews and little brothers. Not for gamers."
4,Run and Shoot,"There is no strategy to this game. I have not played past Battlefield titles so have no frame of reference but this game is strictly run around and shoot as much as you want. While it is totally fun to play that way at times, I would like to have some thought involved strategy."
2,"Great Movie, terrible Blue Ray","I'm new to Blue Ray so after the few that I've purchased thus far with the fantastic picture quality that only BR can give you I had high hopes for seeing Gulliver's Travels as I've never seen it before. Sadly, this was a great disappointment. The video quality is on par with VHS. Although the colors are quite vibrant, the picture is a horrible. Comparing this to the recent BR of Pinochio and Pixar's beautiful WALL-E discs, this is a version of Max and Dave Fleischer's Gulliver's Travels is a bad April Fool's Day joke perpetrated a month early. Avoid at all costs and demand a proper restoration of this classic film."
1,A transfer as horrible as the bogus 5-star reviews :(,"This release is not in the proper aspect ratio and digital scrubbing and manipulation have left a nasty toll. Important details have been swept away. Bold lines of the drawings have turned faint and wispy, and the colors are thin and unstable. The image has been reformatted to fit the wide television screens of today, losing the top and bottom of the original frame. There is also some stretching distorting the picture.If you want classics done right on BD, buy the Disney releases. This disk isn't worthy as a drink coaster."
1,This Blu-ray Disc Is a Travesty,"The original aspect ratio of this title is 1.37:1, that's roughly the aspect ratio of a standard def TV (4:3). The images in this BD have been cropped at the top and bottom to fill a widescreen TV (16x9) and that is simply unacceptable. Big studios have learn that staying faithful to the original aspect ratio is the right thing to do. Disney have recently re-released a remastered ""Pinocchio"" with amazing results and guess what, they kept the original aspect ratio of 1.33:1.If all you want is a cartoon to babysit your toddler and couldn't careless if parts of the image are missing, then this BD might do it for you, but if you care about the integrity of the original art, then this BD is a travesty, there's no kinder word for such action."
1,AWFUL IN EVERY WAY!,"The five-star reviews are incredibly misleading and suspect. This is a classic animated film that has unfortunately fallen into public domain and unscrupulous hands. It has been cropped and stretched to fill a wide screen while excessive digital noise reduction has been employed to ""clean it up."" This version is not from the original film elements and it is a major disappointment. Save your money and wait till this film is released properly."
4,Color my knitting world,"The book is full of great ideas to start building color projects. I would have liked to see more projects that were more reflective of the South American color combinations shown in the photos, but at least it is an incentive to start thinking about adding more color."
5,great techniques,will cover the special techniques for creating and finishing garments .Brandon has a natural instinct for color and design.He will show you how to create a color palette to your liking.You'll gain confidence to make a sweater design uniquely yours.
1,don't buy this album,This albums sound quallity is too bad.I have nosferatu and distant thunfer they are awesome classic progressive/thrash albums in 80's. I know its Bootleg concert but I did not understand anything. don't waste your money for this concert album better to listen old albums of Helstar.
1,"Labtec Wireless Desktop, the Worst Product I Never Bought","I don't think I ever bought this product, but Amazon says that I did, so I have a God-given right to review it. If I were to not buy a wireless desktop set, I think I would buy a more popular brand such as Microsoft, Logitech, or even Dell.Plus, this set only works up to three feet away, and you have to hook up some invasive PS/2 box to your rig. Nowadays, you can just hook up a microscopic USB bluetooth dongle and you can be pinching a loaf from the bathroom as you surf the net in the living room (provided that your living room and bathroom are within the correct viewing angle, or you have a friend relaying your cursor's onscreen coordinates to you).In summation, I'd like to say that the Labtec 967115-0403 Wireless Desktop falls short in a lot of ways - the most important of which is that I never bought it."
4,It's pretty convenient,"Let's imagine how it would be convenient to avoid all the terriblesome cords and be comfortable with sitting apart from the monitor, sitting into the chairs. You have great wireless keyboard and optical mouse, it's easy to use and install it."
5,all the ronettes you will ever need,"The best Ronettes compilation out there that I could find; odd that it (and other Ronettes recordings) are not more widely available on CD or via download - probably a Phil-Spector-owns-the-masters-and-is-crazy issue, I assume. All you will ever need unless you are a Ronettes completist."
4,Antique Oak Capri Changing Table,We recently bought the Antique Oak Capri Changing Table - We bought the crib first - loved it - but soon found nothing matches the crib - so we decided to just go ahead and buy the changing table - granted there are better ones out there - but i wanted the babys room furniture to at least match - my husband put the changing table together in about 2 hours - great instructions - just time consuming - the overall appearance of the table is not the same exact finish as the crib - slightly off - but does have lots of room for baby stuff - and later when we do not need it as a changing table it will not look like one - can easily use it for years and years to come - great transition piece.
2,CD _Sweet Talk_ has NO overtone singing etc,"This music is one woman's voice, pleasant, various instruments, pleasant, and in all a Too-Simple collection of love songs. The CD appeared again in a search for ""CD overtone singing"" : a short list but should exclude this. I played it once, Yawn."
5,The BEST crossword game I've ever used! Very Fun!,"This was game was not only fun, but it was also challenging!I've played many hours and continue to try to conquer the many puzzles.I was able to print the puzzles and bring them with me.I recommend this over the other puzzle games out there."
4,Therapy for octogenarians,This is just the right kind of stuff for old geezers to keep their brain cells from atrophying. I'm in my 81st year of life. Working crossword puzzles is part of my personal anti-Alzheimers project. The fact that I can get hard copies of the puzzles is also a plus.
5,A ton of good puzzles for very little money!,"Well, my title says it all--where else can you get 1000 high-quality puzzles for under twenty bucks??!! Interface is simple to use with Hint, etc. features. I printed a bunch of puzzles and stuffed them in my laptop case for plane rides--now if I could just manage to keep a pen in there too!! Puzzles are challenging but I can generally get every letter (sometimes all correct, sometimes a few errors). Excellent product for any crossword enthusiast!!"
3,Oldie but a Goodie,"Like the game, too bad it is only for Mac OS classic. Would really like to see it on OS X."
2,Difficult one,"It isn't quite what I expected. It is hard to see the letters and answers on the screen and it will not enlarge on the screen. There are a lot of tough ones. You can go across very easy but going down you have to click twice or more times to go down. The letters aren't very clear. It hard to tell a ""Y from a ""V"". I do not recommend this product as fun. It highly priced for the enjoyment and relaxation you get from it."
2,"OK, but not great","Just an OK product. Would like to be able to use the Tab key to move around. Sometimes it won't accept the correct letter. Would like it to give the corresponding clue for the across or down function when you're in that grid, but instead you have to scroll up or down the lists. Would also like to it be availabe for a full screen view. Not worth the money as far as I'm concerned."
3,Pretty Good But With Many Error Messages,"I have had this joystick for a few months now and I have not found a game that it is not compatible with. But sometimes I get error messages from windows like ""Device is malfunctioning, try unplugging it and replugging it in again"" that doesn't work and I have to restart my pc. Otherwise it is a pretty good joystick overall.P.S. I am running Windows XP Home With SP2"
2,Logitech Wingman Attack 2 Joystick,"Bought this to use while playing Team Fortress 2and when it arrived, I thought it had great feel.The problem was, it didn't come with any softwareand the Logitech website didn't have software thatsupported the mac for this product.I give it two stars for product quality, butsoftware support isn't there at all."
3,Calibration,Ive had this stupid stupid THING for about a year.Every time i play IL-2 the calibration gets all messed up.Im so PISSED.
5,Needed this disc,I loaned out my full set to some so called friends back when this was first available one disc was missing of course no one knew where it was.It took a few years but this is what i needed to finish my first season of queer as folk.Thank you
3,Avatar X Box,"This game is fun but being only a one person game keeps the children from going back very often. My son says there are ""lots"" of good things but it still isn't a top netch game."
3,Avatar Game,Looked for this old game everywhere. Should have started with Amazon. My son had been asking for it since he played it 2 years ago.
3,i love this show,"this was a cool game. but i beat it in like 2 nights. i was hoping for a longer story line with more levels. but i did enjoy playing. i was kinda mad that they didn't use toft as the earthbender but i guess the game came out before she was a character on the show. the plot was good but wish it was more like beating the firelord or zuko or something more like the show, since the big boss itsn't even a character. overall i say buy it but only cause it is such a good price here on amazon."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Perhaps it is to early in the game, but I just thought that I would be able to choose who I get to be and play the game even though it is entitled avatar. All in all I think it is a good game. Might be a little to complicated. Definately for 10 and up. You have to earn you avatar power so don't think you start off in superhero style you have a staff and you wack a lot of wooves to build up point to earn you powers for later battle. It is a good game if you a fan of the avatar cartoon and I think you will fill like you are part of the game. I would recommend this game."
1,Avatar XBox game,Unfortunately we did not realise when we purchased this game that it would not work on our TV's in Australia. My 9 year old son was so disappointed when he tried to play it with no success.
3,It was okay,"I should have known better than to purchase this one as I am often a little bored by workout DVDs (I'd prefer to get outside or watch TV while on a machine), but this had some good reviews so I thought I'd try it. As usual, I was bored. And I don't enjoy DVDs that require accessories and this one requires a pole/broom handle. I had a c-section and was looking for a way to ease back into working out, but really, by the time I had healed enough to exercise, I felt good enough to run or do other activities. If you enjoy easy mat-style pilates and aren't bored by slower moving workout DVDs, you might really like this. I also think it might be good for someone having a more difficult c-section recovery. It just wasn't a good fit for me."
4,Good low impact workout,"I liked this workout. It leaves you feeling warm and relaxed, not exhausted. I think there could be a few more advanced options for when you get a little farther along... but it's a good one to start with."
4,a little slow,"I started this video exactly 6wks post parting after a c section. It is a decent workout at that point and I'm thankful I had it. But I quickly found it to be a little too slow and not challenging enough. It is hard to find the time to do the whole workout with a newborn. I wish it were a little shorter, more challenging and to the point. I did like some of the exercises so much that I do them on a regular basis when I get a free 5 min and don't have time for the video."
3,"Ab exercises were tough, but overall a decent workout","After my csection my stomach was pretty numb for a few months--barely any feeling while my nerve endings were repairing themselves. The ab section of this workout was a little rough. The rest of the workout was pretty good though. I bet if you had a normal-delivery it wouldn't be as hard to do the ab workouts, you just can't feel your abs after a csection to know if they're working. 6 months later I would now be able to do the ab workout section."
3,Not for me,"To be fair, I should say that didn't read the description of the DVD before purchasing....I saw ""Pilates"" and ""c-section"" and the $3 price tag, I bit. Fusion means just that...fusion. It has very little Pilates, and lots of step aerobic moves (which I hate), and it requires the use of quite a few props. Too much work to try to locate a broom handle in my home; I did it once and even as a post-op mother, the workout seemed way too slow and simple. I would recommend this for a senior citizen who is JUST beginning a fitness program."
3,Waste of Money,My wife bought this and used it once. I give it three stars because if you use it every day I am sure it will help with recovery but meh... the body heals when it heals.
2,Vance Kelly,"A disappointment. Vance Kelly is an immensely talented Chicago Blues man, but here he doesn't deliver the goods. He seems more concerned with making a dance record , than a blues record."
5,Lambs Lungs,My 2 shih tzu absolutely love lambies my Winn Dixie in West Palm Beach FL does not carry them any longer I have called and requested them 5 times still no lambies they are losing alot of dog business so I had no choice but to order them on line.They go crazy over the lambies ............One time I accidently ate a little piece I thought it was a piece of cracker my goodness the dogs never have to worry about having to share the lambies with me.
2,Smokehouse review,"I am disappointed in the most recent shipment I received of the Smokehouse Lamb Munchies. I have purchased them numerous times in the past however this last shipment of 4 lbs has 1/2 of the bags in little crumb pieces and the big pieces aren't much better. The packages typically contain large pieces that I cut up, with this shipment all you do is grab a handful of little tiny pieces. I will have to think twice before I purchase these again, I likely would try 1 lb before I buy quantity again."
5,Smokehouse Natural Lamb Munchies,My three Doxies love these things. The price was great and I received the product within a few shorts days after the order was made. Great deal and good for any dog.
3,Pretty good for lamb lung,Nowhere does the product page say its lamb lungs. They sort of let you infer that it is a jerky product. But my dog likes them. I also got some Texas Hold Ems and they're also lung but thinner and my dog won't touch them.I've reordered these a couple times and they are consistent.
4,Would buy these again,Our two dogs just LOVE these. Best part of them for me is that they are made in the USA and not China
4,Neat,"This video is pretty cool, i decided to grab it after seeing a youtube video of a section of the performance. It also has a bunch of extra features on how the whole thing came to be and some other neat stuff. I think I enjoy the hard sell encore cd a little more than the original. nevertheless a nice addition to anyone's dj shadow or cut chemist collection."
2,Word of Warning,Beware! This is NOT Simon Phillips the drummer. I bought the CD by mistake. There was no review so I assumed it was Simon Phillips the excellent drummer. Although the CD is not bad...it was not what I was expecting.
5,Follow the money to learn,"Economics drives life. Economics is a lively entertaining force when studied within the seemingly modest domain of a single small-ish city. Statistics are all one gets at the national level. Working within just Oneonta NY (USA), the author reveals the myriad of interconnections that bind together seemingly unrelated facets of this lovely upstate town. Every town deserves to have its rich history captured like this."
5,Before the 'Lady In Red' stabbed him in the back.,"I was first turned onto DeBurgh's work by my older brother who was discerning his musical taste half a decade before I was. Chris DeBurgh is most known for his soundtrack score to ""Lady In Red"" which in someways made and destroyed his chances for exposure. Spanish Train remains to be one of my favourite selections in his collection and my entire library. This album has no traces of that sappy 80's ballad which has become notorious. Spanish Train and other stories is filled with songs that are thought provoking, heart wrenching and fun. An eclectic collection of emotions and a must have for any Chris DeBurgh fan or a fan of ""just plain good music""."
1,Waste of Time,"Net Force - State of War is a total waste of the reader's time. Mr. Clancy should be embarrassed to have his name associated with it. The writers try to spin a high tech thriller, but have no mastery of either their subject or the techno thriller style. --- A total waste of paper and money."
1,Total Disappointment,"This is, simply put, one of the worst books I have ever read. The book lacked substance and interest. The characters were unrealistic and the story line was completely predictable. At times I felt that the book was written by ""Tim the Toolman Taylor"" -- especially when the author named and then described weapons in vivid detail -- argh...argh...argh.I finished the book (I thought it might get better...it didn't) and walked away thinking that Clancy should revoke the rights to anyone else writing on his behalf."
1,Worst Tom Clancy's Novel ....Period!,"This is by far the worst Tom Clancy's (or franchise) novel to date. It got so much un-interesting facts / drama / nonsense, that keep me guesing.. where is the good stuff???Even after reading it (which is a waste of time) I still don't understand the intention of the bad guys (controling the world with network chaos, etc etc??)This novel also bears a lot of product endorsement. <..."
1,Can anyone just stop this???,"I do have similar view several Net Force books back but this one really wins it - and makes me write this. Could anyone tell the authors not to continue as they seem to forever??? A plot which is less than void of anything of action, predictable heroes with hobbies that the authors never seem to be bothered to recapitulate at least three times within one book, and if, being totally used they disappear simply to be replaced by new ones who happily continue the same path... One really wonders if Mr. Clancy needs to put his name on the cover of these books. Awwwful."
1,Virtually Silly,There are so many concepts in this book that don't play well. The worst is that a virtual reality approach to interacting across networks could keep up with the speed of computer actions. The ending makes no sense and the antagonist just loses all his supposed intelligence and cunning near the end of the book.This book (NOT by Clancy) lacks Clancy's technical expertise and realistic approach to suspense and action.
2,The first Tom Clancy I read was not a good one!,"My wife picked this up for me - she thought I might enjoy Tom Clancy. In fact I do - but this isn't really Tom Clancy at all and, in fact, I'm embarrassed for him.The good news: It's an easy and almost fun read.The bad news: The writing is absolutely dreadful. I mean really really bad.I will give some other Net Force books a chance some time. The premise is interesting and there are supposed to be some good books in the series out there. This, unfortunately, is not one of them!"
5,Revived an older computer,I needed to revive an older computer at my church and this older Pentium Dual core replaced a Celeron in a 775 socket. More memory and a new HD and it works great.
4,I used it to organize the office shipping area,"This is a pretty decent labeler. The machine was actually intuitive enough to use without the instruction book -- but I found I needed the guide to figure out how to change the size and style of the typefaces, and how to clear the display all at once, rather than letter by letter. (It doesn't automatically clear the entries after they print.) There are a lot of nice features, such as special foreign-language characters, vertical printing, two-line printing, and automatic centering. I was just a little bit disappointed in the quality of the printouts. If you look closely, you can see that they are slightly ""bitmapped,"" or jaggedy around the edges, like an old dot-matrix printer. I was expecting more of a laser-printer quality. Still, it's a good unit for labeling shelves in our shipping area, which is why I bought it."
3,"Böhm is great, the singers on this set are not","I will not write a lengthy note here. I only would like to say that Schreier's shrill voice (as Belmonte) ruins this otherwise fine recording. I don't like Schreier's voice and when I compare his singing with the wonderful singing by Wunderlich as Belmonte under Jochum, it is like comparing a rotten tomato to a fresh one. I know this sounds very harsh but I suggest you listen first to Schreier and then Wunderlich sing ""Wie ängstlich"" and you will understand.. probably! So, this is definitely not the best choice if you don't like Schreier's voice. On the whole I think this recording is overrated. The more recent recordings of this opera are at least as good as this on the whole. However, I prefer Jochum and Wunderlich by a mile."
4,"A good culminating read, after Gardner's others.","This book pulls together Gardner's cognitive theory on extraordinary individuals and leaders. He refines his framework for the study of extraordinary individuals of the 20th century by identfying four forms: the master, maker, introspector, and influencer. It builds upon elements from Creating Minds and Leading Minds. The one individual that ties all three books together is the life of Gandhi. A very interesting, fast read for those in leadership positions."
3,Interesting,"An interesting analysis of what an extraodinary mind is and does. Through presenting 4 types of extraordinary minds : Master, Maker, Introspector, and Influencer, and then providing an example for each (Mozart, Freud, Woolf, and Gandhi respectively) insight is gained. It is a quick, but knowledgable read, and I reccomend it for those interested in seeing what makes a mind higher than the average individual. Overall, intriguing in the fact that Gardner is able to pick out traits and then term them on the path to extraoridinariness."
5,Excellent informative book,"I first read this book in 1998 or 1999, and since have lost my copy, but I remember enjoying every page of it. I also remember identifying myself as a ""Freud"" - creating a new domain. Would recommend this to anyone who is interested in clarifying and expanding their consciousness, educational realm, and creating a rich learning context."
4,Nice label,"Works as advertised. Although my label printer doesn't use up all the space of the 1"" width. I actually got the TZe251, which is same quality as the TZ251."
3,"Okay, not great","I found this book very hard to absorb. I must have missed something in the description but the book isn't what I thought it was going to be. There were a lot of great explanations for why you do things, but I look for concrete tools to help you practice how to stop doing those things and I didn't feel I found a lot in this book."
5,A Must Read!,Anyone in a relationship should read this book. It is very inciteful and helps you understand that sometimes what you are experiencing is a small blip in your relationship that can be worked out. You begin to see the motivation of your partner and the root of the differences with a better understanding.
2,Do not agree,"With the bulk of these reviews or the author. Only ""Woman can provide a safe place for us.."" as children. Pg 22. ""Acceptance is approval..."", pg. 32. No it is certainly not! I actually wrote WTF in the book next to these gems. I am only on pg 32. Are you a lot of Buddist ditto heads?"
5,"A relationship ""must-read""","I found this work to be remarkable in it's approach and insights. The approach is very realistic as it explores the five keys to mindful loving. It begins with our childhood, takes through our search for a partner, and guides us with the struggles that occcur on our journey of love. The book provides a wealth of exercises and discussion points for couples.The author does an amazing job of helping us see our formative years and the influence that our childhood experiences have on our search for love. This is followed by a guided search for love. He takes us through the struggles of romance, fear, conflict, and ego and offers valuable insights into relationships. Richo draws on an eastern concept of mindfulness as he explores each of the five hallmarks. A must read for anyone who is relationship oriented."
2,disappointing,"I read a lot of books on relationships for my work as a therapist. Additionally, I have practiced and studied mindfulness meditation myself. Richo tries to blend his ideas on these two human experiences, but not as well as I had hoped.The book is wordy, redundant, verbose. I suggested it to a client before I had completed it and she rejected it after a few pages saying to me, ""I'd have to get a graduate degree to understand some of the terms."" Not good.Next time, I'll be suggesting the works of Harriet Lerner."
1,They are selling out!,"It appears that in the light of all the boy bands out there making gross amounts of money, that the blenders finally sold out. It was bound to happen. Just like the Nylons before them, they have produced a so called ""pop"" album that seems to take roots from groups such as the Back Street Boys. If you are looking for an acapella album you would be better getting their older albums. If you are looking for typically ""boy-pop"", i supose you'd like this album. The harmonies may be nice but the lyrics are a little lackluster, i.e. ""McDonalds Girl""?"
3,Dissappointing,"Let me start by saying that The Blenders are one of my favorite groups. I was hoping that on this, their 5th album of entirely new material, (""Now & Then"" contained 3 songs from each previous album as well as 3 new tracks) they would get back to their roots of acapella. Well maybe I was expecting too much. Despite all of its horrible boy-band vibe, some tracks, like their wonderful cover of Curtis Mayfeild's ""People Get Ready"" and the fabulous ""Turn Around"" are worth it. ""Can't Get Over You"" is good pop song at best, but not really Blenders material. I'm sure some people won't be dissapointed by this album. I was. Nice try, Blenders. There's always another album."
2,Generic pop sound,"I should qualify my assessment of this album by noting that if what you want is soft rock without concern for lyrics, this is fine.This is certainly not what I hoped to hear.I really liked the album ""Totally Whipped"". It had terrific a capella, and the lyrics were creative and off-beat. This effort lacked that character and was a drastic change of direction that I thought was bland. The instrumentals were uninteresting, the vocals were nowhere near as clever as on their a capella efforts. I found this to be generic, syrupy pop music.I suppose that musicians--all people, really--ought to do what makes them happy. It is unfortunate for the fan when that happiness goes in a direction that is unappealing.Here's hoping for another cutting-edge a capella effort down the road..."
1,only terrible cd they have put out,"i can see what these guys are trying to do; expand their market appeal. but sorry, leave the teen pop to the backstreet boys. stick to the tight harmonies!! even their self titled cd using instruments was 10X better than this. couldn't even listen to it more than once and i ditched it into the used bin."
3,An Interesting Read,"Although DJ Conway has some of the ideas of Shamanism firmly in hand, it's difficult to determine how authentic they are. As a work of artistic storytelling, I find it to be rather compelling. The oak part is easily discernable: there's lots of historical, or mythic elements contained in celtic culture that are lightly brushed upon here. Many references are given, many words defined etc. The ash (the world tree in Norse mythos) is much harder to discern, and for one such as myself, who knows not much more about shamanism than my Thor comics, probably not relevant. However, the double definition of the word is easy to discern, and it goes without saying that one thing Magicians are known for is fighting each other. So I spose you could pick sides, since it's easy to do. There's many sticking points though, and those attempting to fight Conway on her own pages, may find themselves stuck in the thorns..."
1,True Shamanism can't be learned from a book,"Leave aside all the inaccuracies that mar this book. Leave aside the question of whether there was an indigenous form of shamanism among the pre-Christian Celts (most scholars think not). This book claims to teach you how to be a shaman. Not everyone who journeys to other worlds through creative visualization is a shaman. Above all, shamans serve their communities by acting as mediators between the inhabitants of different worlds. But those who practice shamanism in tribal communities generally agree that apprenticeship to an experienced shaman and commitment to serve the community are necessary components of one's training. All this book does is teach you how to be a tourist in other worlds."
1,Stick to what you know,"First . . . I regret that I can give this book no fewer than a single star, as it certainly deserves worse.While the concepts were interesting, I had one main objection: that the shaman in practice MUST believe in an all-encompassing, universal spirit god.Conway . . . stick to writing about what you know about . . . namely Wicca."
1,Do yourself a favor,"Anytime you see a book written by Ms Conway, don't walk away, run away. Her books are full of wrong information and a complete waste of money."
3,Approach with caution,"I pretty much agree with everything said in other reviews, good and bad. This book is not an historically acurate portrayal of the ancient Celts, and it will not make you a shaman.That having been said, I don't think it is without value. The book is a good introduction to a way of meditation, and her insights into the ancient Celts, which she admits are gleaned from her inner research and not academic research, are interesting, though not historically accurate. I wouldn't reccomend against reading this book, though please don't beleive you are learning Celtic shamanism. And maybe buy it used."
1,Don't be Tempted ...,"... to buy this book if you are looking for good information related to Celtic Paganism. You won't find it here. What you will find is another attempt to put a veneer of ""celticism"" over Wiccan spirituality and pass it off as Celtic Paganism. Once again DJ Conway shows her inept knowledge of the Celts and *REAL* Celtic spirituality and cranks out a book aimed at those who want to ""learn to be a Celtic Pagan in 5 easy steps"" without any real background information on who the Celts were and how their outlook on life and Cosmology differs from the Greco-Roman outlook and our Western viewpoint today. If you want to learn a Wiccan spirituality that is painted with pretty Celtic designs and motifs, then by all means buy this book. If you are looking for a book that offers information about who the Celts were and a sound method of exploring the possibilities of Modern Celtic Paganism, then look elsewhere."
3,"Interesting, but not complete","Having been an avid reader of a variety of pagan books for several years, this book does go in depth to explain shamanism from a celtic standpoint. It does give a reasonable amount of history to back its standpoint. I didn't feel that it gave a solid path for the solitary to live by. Don't take me wrong, it does guide, but shamanism must be taken very seriously and it can be dangerous if one doesn't fully understand the ramifications of this lifestyle.Overall though, it is still a good read and can add to your pursuit of knowledge in this subject."
4,Good beginners book,"I bought this book as a beginners guide to Celtic Shamanism. I found it an excellent starting guide (notice I said starting guide), and too this day am often referring back to it. As with all outside (of self) gathered information, it is a guide only, your own personal experiences are the definitive experience."
1,Oak Ash & Thorn M.C.S...(L.C.W.),"DISAPPOINTING, WHAT KIND OF HERBAL SHAMANISM INSTRUCTS YOU ""Drink a cup of herb tea OR SODA....""???????????? i had heard this author was known for making.. educated fabrications.. and stating personal experiences as fact, but this book was less than i had prepared for. i read a lot on this subject and i DO NOT RECOMMEND PAYING FOR THIS BOOK! IF YOU WANNA READ IT GO TO A LIBRARY!(i wouldn't make a Special trip, but if you're there....) I put this in the category of BS bedtime stories, the only part i say is good is the personal inventory for why you want to be a shaman, but then its still worded for extreme amateurs and skeptical readers.. this is a Wiccan book for 6th graders, its fantasy fiction, or simply BS.. this wasn't worth the shipping, let alone the $5 i lost.."
5,Excellent Book,"I have found this book to be a very useful tool for some intensive inner work I have done. The negative criticism by one or another of the reviewers of this book only tells about their sour grapes and reveals how little they see. This book is very well worth getting if you have a heart connection with the Celtic and Wiccan world and are interested your own inner process. Another book I found very useful and that I can recommend along the same general lines, although it is quite different is ""The Shaman's Body"" by Arnold Mindell"
1,Learn a lesson....,"To check out how well-researched books actually are before you buy them. This book was historically inaccurate, with fantastical notions thinly disguised as ""Magick"". I should have known better than to buy a book on Celtic paganism from an author that publishes books on every other ""brand"" of paganism as well. She is a good writer, and the pictures are pretty, but the content belongs more in the ""fiction"" department than anywhere else. A better place to start: ""Circle of Stones"" by Erynn Laurie."
4,Good beginner book,"I found the book quite useful myself and think it would be very useful to a beginner. It covers alot of basics and does leave you ready for the next step, to learn more. But isn't that what an introductory book is for?"
2,Shamanism Lite,"I found this book to be of limited usefulness, although I had initial great hopes for it. I am a Wiccan priestess and the student of a Native American shaman because celtic shamans are few and far between, and had hoped that this book would fill in some of the gaps. There was little in this book that is not covered better elsewhere, and most of what the author conveys is very superficial."
1,Poorly Done,"Research is wanting here... if you use the information as a personal path, know that it's not based on a tradition, but creative license"
3,Great book for personal inner-journies.,"This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to apply shamanic practice to celtic mythology for inner-journies and OtherWorld journies. However, gaelic traditionalists would *not* recommend this book. I however, enjoyed it and I do recommend it for anyone who practices celtic wicca."
1,GET SERIOUS,"With over 15 years of experience and up to date on all of the new product lines as well as the upper level machines, I must say that this book isn't worth the paper it is printed on. Most if not all of the information contained is readily available from the manufacturer of the appliance. If you have a more serious problem with your machine then you do in fact need a technician to inspect it and give you the options to repair it CORRECTLY or to purchase a new machine. Put your dollar to use and hire a real professional, with real, in the field experience. I wish I could rate this no stars!"
4,Out of the Box AdHoc Network - As easy as 1-2-3,"I was a little wry about so called simple out of the box peer-to-peer USB wireless network sticks as I hadn't worked with them, let alone any wireless networks. It really couldn't have been more simple. The software guides the installation process with both a beginner and advance setup, both allowing to perform peer-to-peer or access point connections. State whether the computer of interest is the internet host or sharing from another and it takes care of the rest. There is 64 & 128 bit security setup with Alphanumeric and passphrase verification. CON: Some reason, I can't achieve a rate above 2MBits at a distance of 15 feet. Will have to consult the manufacturer as the help section does not address this concern."
3,Pretty good hair styling spray,"To be honest, I don't use this very often since it feels like traditional hair spray vs. styling spray. It does smell great though. I use it when I need to do a quick touch up with my flat iron. I still haven't found the perfect solution, but I'll continue searching! :)"
3,Not impressed,"I finally sucked it up and paid for a bb hairspray. It's light weight and smells good, which i really like but it does not hold well at all. I am dissapointed and definitly do not think it's worth the price!"
2,online shopper love it,"don't care for this doesn't hold and would not remended it would not buy again, would love to have something that would hold and not flaten your hair"
1,Not an OE fit!,I ordered this part for my 1999 GMC Yukon. It fit correctly but would not cycle the entire range of motion compared to the original unit. It might work for other GM models but do not order for your Yukon. Amazon did fully refund my money so thumbs up to them for that.
1,"Good grief, what drivel.","All these issues have other constitutional rights much more valid than this made up catch-all variation of the 'right to privacy' the authors proffer.This book is an illustration of: constitutional ignorance or willful manipulation.I ask you: what newfound unconstitutional 'right' could not be fitted in by these authors? Abortion is already shoe-horned in here, but I'm sure they will conjure up more.There is an valid issue on government intrusion, but these two would only increase the intrusion - in the name of rights of course.Don't waste your money, buy something about the Bill of Rights without an agenda."
5,Horrors of our Government translated from legalese to layman's terms,"This book starts off Rated R. I wish I could give a copy to my teens, but it gets a little too descriptive (necessary for impact though) of police violations on women. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. (Maybe when they're older...) It is a collection of some landmark cases, conflicts, and horror stories of the reality of our government's instrusiveness into people's personal lives. It is an eye-opener to those who blindly follow government orders. I'm comfortable reading legal documents, but I thought one of the book's better points was that it put legal terms into layman's terms. I found the book so lively and intriguing I finished it in a day! I definitely recommend this for anyone concerned about government instrusiveness and loss or interpretation of constitutional rights."
5,A well-written account of unsolved privacy problems to solve,"Writing in a reader-friendly way, the authors give us what they learned from their library and field research about cases that illustrate all too clearly how much work there is to be done to protect privacy."
4,"Thought provoking, and a little scary!","This fascinating book outlines privacy rights in the United Statesthrough a review of case law. Covering citizens' privacy rightswith respect to police encounters, the media, and one's own body,the book reveals how far the law has evolved, and how muchroom there is for further protection. My personal reactionwas shock at how many areas that I thought were protected, infact are not, or are still under contention."
5,We Don't Have The Rights We Think We Have,"Many Americans adopt the concept that if they personally think something is right, then there must be an existing law that agrees. We think we have a basic right to privacy, but, surprise, we don't. Ms Kennedy, and Ms Alderman do a good job of presenting what rights we have, and, sad to say, what privacy rights are not guaranteed us."
5,"Very Nice GPS, Marry Me?","I bought the eAvinu over a month ago. Without reading anything, I plugged it in and took a 1200 mile trip. It worked perfectly. Now I am reading the instructions and am even more pleased. It was plenty fast, always locked on, gave good navigation instructions. My trip was from Tennessee to Morgantown to Pittsburg and back. When I missed a turn (m mistake because the eAvinue told me to turn, it got me to the destination via a new route... cool enough.I married the GPS shortly thereafter, unlike the Tom Tom One, the eAvinue accepted...It will not wash windows."
1,Terrible and no updates or service from JVC,"Pros: Cheap. Was on sale for $150 from CompUSACons:1) Journey over by the time it finds signal2) If it does find a signal, it sends you the most inconvenient way, tells you to turn where there are no turns.3) It's too heavy and constantly falls off the windshield.4) When it shows 3 out of 4 bars on the battery indicator = low battery and it's just about to die.5) No map update support at all. I seem to spend most of my time driving in the wilderness, offroading according to this unit. (The Crosstown Expresway in Tampa - built in the 70's doesn't exist)...6) Freezes up almost every time it's switched on.7) Useless menu8) Useless in cities due to poor reception9) Useless in the countryside when driving under treesOh, I have another Pro:For some reason this DID work going through the Eisenhower Tunnel on I-70 in Colorado... lol"
1,Nightmare GPS - Stay Away!,"I bought two, as they were on sale. I gave one to a friend. Both units are horrible. I have sent it in for service twice. It has a hard time gaining signal. It loses signal while driving. It does not always give the proper route. It notes exits on expressways where there are none. It freezes up. I have read other reviews. If you want it for a movie viewer, have fun. If you need it for travelling - do not purchase this unit. It probably deserves a recall. Many of the other reviewers had the same problems as me. In addition, JVC service doesn't care if they keep it for a year. All in all - Stay far away!"
2,Cannot catch the signal in Cities,"I bought this unit just because it plays videos and it is inexpensive. I am not happy with the product. I used Garmin2610 before and this unit is inferior compare to Garmin. The major problem with unit is: ""it doesn't catch the signal properly"". I went to New York city and moving around all over the streets and it never get the Satellite signal. It only detected the signal on West Side Highway. Garmin didn't have this problem, it loses the signal in New York often but Not like JVC which never receive satellite signal. I went to Florida and I was not happy with it's perfomance."
3,"Mad, Sad, and Excited","Well, this is truly a good book but a lot of it makes me mad. Darren Shan keeps killing of all the best characters. That makes me mad and sad!! But, as in all the other books it leaves you hanging at the end, which makes you really want to come back for more."
5,AMAZING!!!,"This book was amazing! It is very upsetting, because of all the taken lives, but perfectly written. Very touching. Please read."
5,Lord of Shadows comin may/06,i can't wait till it comes out i LOVE the cirque du freak series it rocks even better than HP
4,An interesting compendium,"More than anything else, this particular volume is a compendium of diverse case studies. While none of the cases are analysed in sufficient depth, this is certainly a useful ""get-acquainted"" volume of work examining evolution and de-escalation of a broad spectrum of social conflicts, and offers the reader sufficient background to help s/he greatly in further research. In sum, this book makes a very nice starting point for a study in conflict."
5,Can't wait to hear the upcoming full cd,"Ode Music has been out for about 2 or 3 weeks now here in Belgium, and now I finally have the chance to write a review for this cd. It is completely instrumental, as it is meant to be the soundtrack for a movie nobody will probably ever see. But the cd can easily be listened to without seeing any images. Just make your own images while you're getting carried away by these great soundscapes. A must for all Palace fans of course, and a fantastic teaser for the upcoming full cd (hopefully in March)."
1,nothing at all,"Sure, this is a great cd! (if you like listening to nothing at all) Will Oldham is becoming a living legend for the rich, interesting song writting skills he poured out with his PALACE works. This one however, is nothing at all."
5,Bright label tape,"Very good price at about 50% of what major office supply stores charge. Prompt delivery too. Tape is a fine product, with consistent surfaces, strong adhesive, clear letter appearance. Color combinations (we use several) are effective attention-getters."
1,One year mouse,"This mouse isnt what I expected. I first thought it was an optical mouse. This is like a regular mouse. It has a ball and it has to be cleaned constantly. I bought this mouse about a year ago and its starting to give problems. If you want a mouse with a year durability, this might be your choice. Try searching for other mice out there."
2,"If your course requires it, nothing you can do","I had to use this textbook for a class, which you probably do to. So you probably have to buy this one. It was okay, not hard to read, but I won't be keeping it as a reference work. The authors definitely have an agenda, promoting certain kinds of nutrition over others with very little reasoning, also seems to act like a lot of alternative medicine couldn't possible work even when there are studies to the contrary. I guess it handles the rudiments of biology okay. I will be selling this when I'm finished with this semester.Oh, and there appears to be both a hardcover and a paperback. I bought the paperback used, and it seems to have matched perfectly with the hardcover. Never even used the CD."
1,one of the best,"a very well organized compendium, will ahve a valued place in the Heraldry of the Air Library. Good value for the money, useful as an uppdate to Carl Reis."
2,Super Reader,"When I looked this up the first time, just saw the American edition. The one I found is a puffin, so no doubt that it is a book for kids, from that, and from the length.No need to bother with these, unless you are a kid, or some uber Herc-nerd.Harpies, the odd Satyr, and Salmoneus' travelling theatre. The Eye of the Ram is a magic energy blastic rod held by your evil magician type that is part of Salmoneus' troupe."
4,A Blast from the Past,"I'm sorry to see that this book is out of print, as it was one of my favorites many years ago, when I was about 10 years old (possibly younger). I was considered an intelligent, precocious child, so it was exciting for me to read about ""older girls"" who seemed smart and strong-minded, and were facing adult challenges. I certainly didn't find it to have a corrupting influence in any way; I was inspired by the heroines, especially Maggie, whose wit leapt off the page. I recall trying to read other books by Norma Klein, but this was the only one that I thought was really well-done."
1,this item is defiecent,one of the speakers does not work. Do you plan on doing anything it? My future business requires that you rectify thiis.Lynn M. Elliott.
3,my dog's face is too short,"This is a good product - I like the padded nose piece, but it is made for a dog with a longer face. My dog is an American Staffordshire and the side pieces seem to interfere with his flews. The side of his mouth gets caught up and seems to annoy him. So far I have not found the perfect product for this dog. I tried the gentle leader and the nose piece is too thin and cuts into his face."
1,DID NOT GET,HAD TO CANCEL THIS ORDER DUE TO THE LACK AVAILABILITY. WEB SAID IT WAS IN STOCK AND IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE TRUE. WAS AT LEAST 2 WEEKS OUT AND COULD NOT WAIT.YOUR INVENTORY CONTROL NEEDS TO BE WATCHED MORE CLOSELY.
1,My dog hated this,"It should have told on the package how to get your dog used to the Halti. I simply put it on her and she instantly hated it. She peeled it off her face in a hurry. Unfortunately she hates it so much that it would be quite difficult to desensitize her to it, and I don't have the time or energy to do that right now. I will find another way to keep her from pulling on the leash. It was a waste of money."
3,"a reporter of goes down the Mekong, but remains unchanged","The journey of Gargan's year of travelling down the Mekong begins interestingly in Tibet, but gradually becomes less and less so. He describes one poor village after another and they all begin to coalesce. You increaingly find it hard to tell the Laotians, from the Cambodieans, from the others. One dusty bus ride or poorly functioning boat after another becomes tedious.What is missing is the sense of the traveller, who seemingly remains uninfluenced by the travel. A haunting initial dedication which suggests a lover lost, is unmentioned in the story. In fact, as far as one can tell, Gargen never met an attractive woman, had no feelings, in fact did not suffer from homesickness or nostalgia, or any feelings whatsoever save for the mundane discomforts of the trip.It is all reporting, but there is no reporter."
3,The River's Tale - worth a second look,"The first time I read this book I felt bogged down and board, but I decided to give it a second chance. And I'm glad I did, because Gargan's travels are, at times, incredibly entertaining. As we travel the Mekong River with Mr.Gargan we are introduced to many interesting characters one of my favorites was Dakpa Kelden, a Tibetan man who accompanies Gargan early on his journey. The histories of the people we meet along the way, as well as that of the countries themselves are remarkable. Mr. Gargan on top of being accurate is also lyrical with this work. At times his description of a flower, town, or the river it self are so magnificent that you have to read it again. Overall a good read, especially for those interested in travel, but easy to over look."
2,ok,I don't feel this book has much substance whatsoever. The characters are bland as is the author. The only reason I give it 2 stars is that he does write well. I like his choice of words. It is a tale that could be peppered up more if he could put a bit of humour into it. Read this if you suffer from insomnia. It surely will put you to sleep.
4,"Very Good, too short.","I love Jeremiah Freed and this ep is good, but it is just 5 songs (and i can't stand the song that they cover, Joe does well and you can really feel how powerful his voice is, but i just CAN'T stand that song!). It's a pretty good mix of all their different sounds. I would recommend trying to get your hands on a copy of their independant release, it's their best to date. Don't rate solely on their major label release, to be honest, it's not that great, but if it's all you can get then get it anyways! They have a very rock sound, they have done shows with Lynyrd Skynyrd and they have sold out local venues by themsleves. They have a very solid and loyal fanbase in New England with a few fans from outside the area. So it's gets a four because it's too short, and they should've covered a different Beatles song."
4,Get one for your Chevy truck but not a Ford Ranger,"I bought this to clean up the rear end of my 1996 Suburban. The rusty old frame mounted hitch and old 7 pin plug looked ugly. I don't tow much, so I converted to this and a 4 wire plug. The bumper on the Suburban is pretty stout and rated for 4000 lbs, just as the Curt receiver is. It looks plenty up to the task of holding my bike rack or towing my 19 foot boat.My brother has a 1994 Ford Ranger and it would technically fit that too. It'd be a bit of work, requiring you to drill the two 3/4"" holes in addition to the 1/2"" hole behind the license plate. It does not look like a good setup on the Ranger though, as I think it would put extra twisting forces on the bumper than were assumed when Ford rated it. Give yourself peace of mind and get a sturdy frame mounted hitch for your Ranger."
3,The Art & Career of David A. Hardy,"Not just an art book, as the full page images and 2-page spreads together, represent less than 40% of the 128 pages.Perfect for someone not just interested in art, but also in Hardy's career.SPECIFICS:Page Count: 128Number of images: 112Small images: 38Half page images: 39Full page images: 202-page spreads: 15BW images: 7TEXT:Foreword: 2 pagesIntroduction: 2 pagesChecklist of books by the artist / Acknowledgements: 1 pageIndex of works: 2 pagesThe book has 5 chapters, which detail the artist career in the field from the 1950's to the end of the 20th century: 33 pagesTitle, year, medium used and short comment for each pieceART:0 images: 5 stars39 images: 4 stars63 images: 3 stars8 images: 2 stars2 images: 1 starOverall: 3,5 StarsNote: thumbnails were left out of the rating"
3,Little Book--Big Price,"I think I have the same book and it is about 30 pages and on the back the price is $2.00. Check this out before buying. The book itself is a quick, quick lesson in touch typing and if you do as it says, you'll probably learn to type!"
4,"Hauntingly poetic telling of incest, death and choices.","O'Brien relates Mary's plight of being raped and made pregnant by her father. Her desperation to abort the pregnancy is made difficult because of the anti-abortionists and her age (14). ""Down by the River"" is a poetic telling of harsh, ugly realities"
4,Nice All-around Machine,"This machine has very nice print quality-- especially on photos. I wanted a plain copier (laser-- not ink jet), and needed a back up printer for my small home office. I was prleasantly surprised at the ease of set up (for all the print and scanning drivers), and was very pleased re: the print/copy quality. This machine is especially nice because it works w/ BOTH MacIntosh machines and Wintel machines. It's great for those of us do not want to duplicate equipment (bc we have both platforms). I have had this machine for about a year, and am quite pleased w/ it. I don't use if for heavy copying, but have gone through about 3000 pages so far. And the print quality is still very high. Even the color scanner worked as it should have (although I don't use the scanner much). I don't like the Visioneer software (it's more confusing than it needs to be). But as a back up color scanner, it is more than adequate.I really like this machine (so far)."
1,No tech support with Brother,"I received this product yesterday and have not been able to connect it to my HP Pavillion computer. The tech staff has been completely unavailable and I was on hold yesterday for two hours. They were to call me back, and here it is 6 P.M. on the second day and they have not called. I have never owned a Brother product before, but I am astounded at how poorly I am being treated."
5,Act II of a Forgotten Masterpiece,"These books rank with the greatest books of world literature, and only one of them is still in print? Every library in the world should have a copy of the trilogy. Anyway, here we find the story of the adolescence of Titus Groan. We are also given more depth into the other characters. I'd like to note that my veiw of Steerpike and Flay changed. When I read Titus Groan, I found Steerpike more a sympathetic character than Flay, here it is otherwise. I'd also like to mention on how the events in the previous book effect the life of Titus Groan in such a way that it seems as if it happened in real life. We see the conflict inside of him between the pride of his linege and the desire for freedom, that eventually has Titus flee the great castle. The conflict between freedom and desire for the home is carried into Titus Alone."
4,"Slow, but worth the effort","This second part of the Gormenghast trilogy focuses on Titus Groan, 77th Earl of Gormenghast's youth, from schooling to his ascention to manhood. This book took me almost a year to read (one long break) - the first half of the book progresses incredibly slowly, even for Peake's normally languid pace - I just couldn't cope. I can appreciate his qualities as a wordsmith - his vocabulary is second to none but I couldn't help but think he could have shortened things somewhat- the schoolmasters' preparation to court Irma drags on and on, but her eventual marriage has virtually no importance to the main plot, and ends up seeming like a waste of time and space - 'I waded through molasses for what!'In stark contrast, the latter half of the book contains Peake's best (I think) work of the entire trilogy, culminating in the hunt for Steerpike - which is superb. Definately a book of two halves, (bad cliche) but the reader is rewarded for their effort in the end."
4,Not for beginners.,"This dvd might be great for someone with some yoga experience, or maybe a tennis player who is already in really good shape. Some of the poses are really hard,and there are no instructions to tell you how to do them correctly."
3,Anastasia is only average,"I like how throughout the video, Anastasia notes which aspects of tennis can be improved by doing the specific poses she demonstrates. I also like that the video takes place at the beach, as the sound of the ocean is very relaxing. However, as petty as it may sound, her voice and the way she draws out each syllable as she counts, ""In-ha-le onnne, ex-hale, in-ha-le twooo, ex-hale"", is very annoying. Also, she holds some of the easy poses for too long and doesn't hold some of the more challenging ones for long enough. It's still worth buying though since overall it's a fairly good workout. There are some stretches that feel really good, especially if you pop this video in after playing tennis. I still think that there are better yoga tennis videos out there though and that Anastasia is only average."
5,It's ALL about the BLUES,"I love the BluesLove Ruth BrownThis CD arrived in a timely manner, and for a reasonable price, in good condition"
5,Brother DR100 Drum is Excellent,"I bought my HL-660 Printer with a DR100 Print drum in 1989. Since then, I have printed nearly 50,000 pages of print and graphics. It worked wonderfully and always gave excellent print quality. The only reason I am looking to replace it now is that my wife hung a plant above the printer and a leaf fell into the drum and burned. Had it not been for that plant, I'd still be printing today. I have looked at the samsung ml1210 printer but the Brother has worked so well, I can't bear to buy anything else."
5,expensive but very nice book,"this is a very nice book, you can read a review of itat:*************** It says it all.the book has some typos but it isstill worth it. If you are new to the subject and want to learn it, it is worth the investment."
3,Easy to Use and Clean - Warm for a couple of hours,"I really like the concept of this product and it is easy to use and clean. However, the coffee does not stay hot very long. You can get 3 hours of 'hot' coffee, and 8 of 'pretty warm' coffee. I live at altitude (6800ft) and prep the carafe with hot water for 15 minutes before using. For the price, it should do much better."
2,Even in Queen size still too tight,I am not a queen sized person (size 8-10) I got tired of the discomfort of regular sized knee highs so tried these. They are still binding--not much different from regular.
3,Just your basic cheap nylons,"These are acceptable, nothing special. They are quite thin and I will use them as disposable nylons. Fit is OK. Quick shipping."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS,I was Browsing and I bought the CD and oh man every song is a hit ! A number 1 pick for 2000
3,Pretty Impressive,"I bought this album because the cover was catchy, I poppedit in my cd player and i've enjoyed it ever since i bought itc-sicc is one arist that need to be recognized soon if he isnt already!"
4,"Beautiful gowns, wonderful pictures, not enough detail...","100 years of Fashion was an excellent read for the more scholarly-minded costumer in need of an accurate source book for their historical costuming. Although it provided plenty of close up pictures and trim details about the garments profiled in the book, it didn't cover sufficient enough details about the garment's construction for one to reconstruct a replica from this book alone. I highly suggest owning this book as an addition to one's library of period sources for research, but if you need a book on how to actually construct a period garment, I suggest using a Janet Arnold book."
1,This item Is BAD,This item DID NOT WORK AT ALL I charged it for 13 hours it rode for 5 minutes razor scooters SUCK the seat completely broke it ruined my christmas
3,The price is right,"However my two little 'hot dogs' only sniffed at the morsels and turned away. It wasn't a total loss, though. I put the content in a nice little tin and used it as a Christmas present for a friend's pooch. The little guy loved it and my friend will be ordering."
5,German shepherd loved these,"We bought these for German Shepherd to use when we were treat train him. Every little cracker is a perfect size for treat training. They are small, and they are very easily handled in a treat pouch. There really isn't much mess. Our German Shepherd loves these things, and will do just about anything for them. If you're looking for new treat for your dog, these will work out nicely."
5,My dog says you should get these for your dog- NOW.,"My dog loves these. She knows the name ""Charlee Bear"" when I say it, and loves chasing around the living room for them. Since they're small, she can have several, and hunt them down. This is one of her favorite flavors (although she's never refused ANY of them). My dog will be most displeased if your dog is denied one of her favorite goodies. :)"
2,Cheese-Its for dogs.,"Somehow I did not expect what I got. These look like cheese-its. They are very small cracker-like things. Not the best choice for a dog treat. I should have looked at ingredients before ordering, but just needed something cheap to get free shipping on another item. Sure won't get them again."
3,Charlee Bear,"These are the perfect size for training but they are not to be confused with actual ""treats."" These are more like you-did-a-good-job-buddy tokens. My dog will eat them happily, but he does not get excited about them, and my dog gets very excited by most anything edible (and some things non-edible).I'd get them again, but only if the price was much lower than it currently is ($8.60). I think $3-4 would be a reasonable price for what you get."
5,Doggies will Love these treats,We have three dogs and they all love Charlee Bear dog treats. We cannot get them in our area so we have to order them. They are worth it as our puppies eat them like candy. We have not been able to get our dogs to eat other treats and have wasted a lot of money buying and trying others. No more. We will be buying more of these.
5,Charlee Bear Dog Treats,We always use the Charlee Bear Dog Treats when training our Great Dane. They are small and not greasy like so many other treats so you can put them in your pockets and not have to worry about them staining. Our vet recommended that we use them in our training sessions.
4,yummy but....,"My dogs love these but they make them very gassey. So if you don't mind clearing the room 20 mins after they eat them, they are great for training because of the small size."
1,Do not trust your boat to this pump!,"I bought the Rule RM1100 pump last year to replace a one year old Rule 1500 pump that had failed. Less than one year later the 1100 failed too. It would come on automatically when the water level rose but would not turn off after it emptied the bilge. It just kept on running. As a result it burned out a $200 2 year old battery. Not suspecting it was a systemic product defect, I bought another RM1100 and right out of the box it did the same thing as the last one- it wouldn't shut off. Do your own research, reviews of this product are riddled with the same story. I won't ever buy another Rule product and you shouldn't buy this one."
1,Shipped the Wrong Pump,"I ordered the RM1100 and received the RM1100A. The ""A"" requires a different mounting. Please note that the RM1100 is not in stock."
5,Bilge pump,"This product was delivered on time, installed and works perfect.Meets all of the manufactures specifications."
5,An absolutely great two-fer cd from a little known UK band .,"Everyone who remembers this band admired the unique musical style which might be compared to an English equivalent of Workingman's/American Beauty period Grateful Dead. Hopefully, the other 2 lp's will also be released soon as a two-fer. A real bonus are the liner notes detailing the band's history."
4,"quality service, quality product.","i don't know if this is the appropriate place to mention this, but i placed my order through the amazon marketplace directly from the publisher over the weekend and received my order on monday! unexpectedly delightful, and what i've read of the book so far has been very insightful. the evident passion makes me very excited to be the owner of this camera."
5,Beautiful and Unique,"This watch as a satin style brown band and can be worn dressy or casual. If you receive an eco-drive that is not operating when you open it, put it under a bright lamp for about 9 hours to fully charge the battery."
5,Terrific,"I am extremely picky about exercises DVDs and this one was awesome. It was just my speed. If you are looking to get your butt kicked its not for you. If you are, however, looking for a fun doable workout this is for you. The pace was of a medium level, but the workout was clever and the cueing was great. I liked the background, the music was a little strange, but not bad. Jennifer Gianni is a good instructor, and easy to follow. It stretched me, got my heart rate up, and toned me. Triple threat??? Yes it was."
4,"Cheap, solid memory","Viking performs with flying colors. Cheap, stable, and compatible. What else could you ask for?"
3,NOT COMPATIBLE,I bought 2 of these to add to my original 32mb that came with the pc. They installed fine and worked ok but causes a system lock up all the time. They work fine by themselves with no problems but now i'm back down to 64mb of ram because these don't seem to be compatible with the original ram. Viking can offer no explanation for the problem.
3,Use to assess your studying NOT as primary study material,"I used this book after I had already studied extensively using Instacert and ""The Soviet Colossus."" Almost none of the exam questions in this book were on the actual exam. The exam itself went more in-depth than this study guide. This book by the way does not teach you anything per se, it's just a collection of numerous 40 question quizes. If you didn't already study this subject this booklet probably wouldn't do you any good. I would stick to the texts recommended by DSST on their web site."
5,The ABC's of Advanced Prostate Cancer,"I am a prostate cancer survivor who has had to make tough decisions on what treatment is best. This book was great in that it defined terms and procedures so the patient can make educated decisions. The info on chemo, radiation and surgery was very informative. Technical jargon like Gleason scores are defined in lay terms. This is the best book on the market for prostate cancer patients. Read this first before having any procedure. Your are responsible for your own health decisions and this will be the best tool in your education process."
3,Review of Moyad's new book,"Moyad's book is excellent in several ways but it has one major drawback. The book is excellent in recommending five servings of fruit and vegetables, in its description of each supplement, and in basing its choices on double blind studies. This last is also a major drawback. Vitamins and supplements often work together and should be tested together. See ""The Real Vitamin and Mineral Book"", by Lieberman and Bruning. The book is in error in evaluating vitamin C. The controversy between Mayo Clinic and Linus Pauling should not be used to discard vitamin C.... I recommend the book for its detailed information on supplements. It is fair to poor for cancer therapy. Reagan Houston,6/28/00."
3,jumbo watch,"The watch face is cute, but huge; band very wide, but has cartoons on inside. Difficult to see the time due to white gloved hands against the white face background."
2,No Battery?,Watch is great looking but there was no battery in it. Now I have to get it to a jewlers to buy a battery. There was no indication of this in the ad or in the instructions.
2,A very confusing book,"I had high hopes for this book from the description and editorial reviews and it was disappointing on all counts. I found none of the characters to be sympathic, in fact they were rather self-centered and annoying. While I don't mind a tragic tale, noone in this book was allowed to be happy or fulfilled, not even the horse."
3,"The Crying of Lot 49, by Lemony Snicket",...[This] joined my twoJapanese comic books and an abacus in their little plasticbag.I will not call it a waste of money. I enjoyed the book.I suggest everyone else put themselves on the on-hold listat the libarary for this amusing book or I suggest thateveryone ask some kind friend or relative buy it for them.
2,Huh?,"Okay, don't get me wrong. I've loved all of the other books. Couldn't wait for this one. And yes, there are about 3 or 4 good laughs here (especially the back of the dust jacket). But mostly, it's just sort of... well, incomprehensible. I certainly can't imagine what anyone who hasn't read all of the other books in the series would make of it, that's for sure. None of the burning questions are answered, of course, and a few more are raised. But it's mainly just a bit more weird than funny. I think it'll hold me for a while until the next in the series comes out, but if I'd missed it entirely, it wouldn't have been a tragedy."
3,something else to spend money on,This is a somewhat amusing if not at often time confusing side note to the series of unfortunate events. While not completely needed to understand the series it does serve to somewhat flesh out some of the bad characters and tell you some more history of the author. What's aggravating is that this does not explain anything really and just leaves you with more questions. Good for the must have everything person everyone else avoid or pickup the paperback.
2,hmmmm....,"well this book puzzles me why would he write something like this he doesn't even answer any of his questions that the chapters are called like""where are the quagmire triplets now?"" he doesnt even say where they are what is the point of writing the book. some things are interesting but really this book seemed kind of pointless. I love every other lemony snicket book that he has ever written its just this one is not very impressive."
3,Loved the other books,"I have read 7 of Lemony Snicket's books and they are wonderful reads. They go quickly and are a great children's literature change. However, this autobiography I find to have extremely long sentences that may prove difficult to any reader. The sentences are all grammatically correct, but go on and on and on. Of course, this is part of his style in his books. Yet, the autobiography contains many of them and I do not find it as enjoyable as his other books."
1,2 Confusing,"i'm sorry, but in this confusing narrative snicket's writing ability is heard, but your incapability to grasp the story is not worth it. fans of the series may enjoy it, but WARNING very very difficult to make sense of."
5,There ARE some clues about Beatrice and VFD just look closer,"This is an AWESOME book! I've seen complaints, a word which here means ""whining because you have to think in order to understand the book"", but, DON'T BELIEVE THEM! IF you read it carefully, you will piece together a LOT about VFD, Beatrice, the survivor of the Baudelaire Fire, and the Quagmire Triplets. Reread it after each new book comes out and you'll get even more information, however subtle. Thinks like The Sebald Code are bound to be increasingly important in the later books."
5,Left With More Questions,"This book was one of my favorite Series of Unfortunate Events books. It was amazing! Any fan of Lemony Snicket would really enjoy all of his cunning ways of ""answering"" the question at the beginning of the chapter.Violet, Klaus, and Sunny weren't mentioned very much, it being an autobiography of Lemony Snicket. During the course of this book, there were many secrets about the mysterious V.F.D. let out, although many questions were left unanswered. What Lemony Snicket book doesn't result in more questions?Any reader who wants to be intrigued, should really read this book. I advise you read the other books first including, ""The Grim Grotto, The Hostile Hospital, The Wide Window, The Carnivorous Carnival, or The Reptile Room."" Any of these sound familiar? There are many others.Overall, this was an awesome book, and I think everyone should read it!"
5,You really don't want to read this....,"i know some people have said that you shouldnt read this until further on it the series but keep in mind that this book was published before a lot of the series. so read it WHILE you're reading the series and you'll catch on to all the little clues and hints. i can't wait until the book with the letters from beatrice comes out, she is more important than just the dedication lines. Keep in mind, Lemony has a lot up his sleeves for the last book...~the world is quiet here~"
4,Law & Order meets Monty Python,"I had lots of fun and lots of laughs reading this book (and was drawn into the mystery of it)....and I am WAY over the ""recommended reading age."" I haven't read any other of the Lemony Snicket books, but I think this book can stand on its own, although I'm sure if I'd known the backstory on the Baudelaire children I would have enjoyed it even more. There is so much creative detail put into the bits of information, and so much subtle humor injected into it that you definitely have to pay attention! I would almost recommend checking it out from the library since once you read it, it's not a surprise anymore, but then the good people at Amazon would be out of a job."
5,"Amazingly Weird, Weirdly Amazing",One of the most unusual books I've ever read...you have to read it at least two times to find the hidden story and learn all the secrets that are inside. Codes and other clues help. It's not like other books for kids - it's a puzzle and a story at the same time. Can't wait for Carnivorous Carnival!!!
3,CONFUSING,"I thought this book was very confusing, but through all the confusion it was pretty funny.I believe this book was worth reading (even though it was confusing).I probably did not understand it because I did not read the Series of Unfortunate Events.So if you did not read the series you should not read this book until you do."
3,Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Biography,I love his books and i am amazed that Daniel Handler can just make up stuff abouta amaginare charecter. This book it seems is full of the same things and he usually has articals from newspapers that i don't even care about. He seems to go of topic and tends to make the book boring. This has nothing at all to do with the Bauldilare orphans and if this was the reason you were going to buy tis book you shouldn't buy it. So in Conclusion this book is just o.k i have read much better biography's that actually have alot of facts and tell about the person. So by far The Series of Unfortunate Events is better then the biography.
3,A strange puzzle,"Right from the title, you know that this book isn't your average autobiography.Lemony Snicket has created a startling book that's not really about his life, but has little details that could really be real. I liked how the author seemed to enjoy poking fun at the normal autobiography, making up strange characters and places, (complete with codes and letters,) that belong in the ""secret agency that stole him when he was young"".I believe this book would be wonderful for readers that love solving a plot along the way and enjoy the abnormal, because there's no doubt about it- this book is strange."
4,Vague! Frightening! Disturbing!,"This latest book,on the doings of Mr.Lemony Snicket,will have your Pavlovian reading bells ringing!If you're not familiar with this unfortunate series of books:BEWARE! It has been some while since a book written for Our time has been seen. A book full of allies and Enemies! If you can find this volume,tary not,buy it Now. In fact,stop reading this review,take to foot,and Run to your nearest book seller!If you must cross the Amazon,do it! You will not be ashamed to make this Purchase. The story of Lemony Snicket is one you will look At again and again. You will enjoy showing it to all Your friends. Should they ask to borrow it,reply: ""get your Own copy,pal!"". So do not sit idle and fear the Risk of owning this tome - varily,feel delightful!Bells are now ringing! Ringing happily for all who enjoy these books!"
4,A Mindgame Book,"This is definately NOT the first Lemony Snicket book you should read. It's a challenging puzzle, pieced together from different bits of information. I enjoyed the other Lemony Snicket books, strange yet interesting, and full of mystery. And they are definately for a reader with a sick sense of humor.This book pretends to answer many of these mysterious questions but raises more questions than it answers. It defininately makes me what to get the ninth book in the series, because maybe the questions will be answered. And then again....."
2,Not sure this was worth my time...,"I LOVE the Series of Unfortunate Events. Can hardly wait for each new episode. My students love the series too (I'm a school librarian). But this 'biography' didn't do much for me. Some of it was funny, but I found most of it downright boring. The best parts were the obverse of the dust jacket and the ""no reproduction"" statement on the copyright page. Lemony, I love ya', but stick to chronicling the Baudelaires and Quagmires."
2,Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography,"This book was definently NOT the best book I've read about the Series of Unfortunate Events. ""Lemony Snicket"" changed the whole ""autobiography"" into a whole nother book. It had nothing about himself, if there was, it was all fake. But there are some positive comments. The book was sort of funny at times, and it explained a little about why some things happened in the previous books. It sort of hinted about some events. If I were you, before buying the book, I would flip through it to see if I liked it."
2,what is this guy's big secret???,"I have read all of the unfortunate Events Books, and I really enjoyed them, but this one is not good. Lemony Snicket acts like a fugitive or something. This book was very confusing to me, and it would be 100% bewilderment if you haven't read all of the books. Acting like you live in a fictional world is fun, but Snicket has carried this joke too far, all the way to a horrible book. I wouldn't spend [money] on it, maybe check it out at your local library."
2,What are all of you thinking?,"Well, I wasn't going to write a review, but then I read all of the other reader's thoughts and decided that somebody should tell the truth about this book.First of all, I suppose that if you are a fan of the SoUE, it is a necessity to read this book, just because there are a few facts which are interesting and relevant to the series. BUT, don't think that you are going to find out all of the secrets behind the story as I did. But, if you really don't feel like wasting an hour, don't read this book.Overall, I wasn't totally disappointed with the book, but I would say that it's definitely not the best book I've ever read or phenomenal like other people have stated."
5,Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography,The product is excellent. Great graphics and editorial quality! highly recommendedI bought for my youngest daughter and she was very happy with this gift
4,"Interesting, but what does it mean?","For me, this book actually gave more questions than answers, but it's a must for series lovers. I reccomend reading at least 1-5 before reading this."
4,This series rules all,"As the rest of the series has proved, Lemony Snicket is a genius. He acts like this book is part of the series by continuing the mysterious organization (VFD). Some of this book was confusing but I still liked it. I was always wondering what was going to happen on the next page."
2,Dont waste youre money.,"This book is just plain stupid, it doesnt answer any of the questions you'd HOPE to find answers for.Most of the time they just show old letters and diary entrys and stuff, it really all doesnt make any sense, most of the time what is written is stuff you know nothing about. Plus the jokes are really lame, unlike the ones in the actually Series of unfortunat Events, they seemed really forced and unatural.It's a pretty boring too, not what I expected after reading the Unfortunate Events series...Though it is, um...., nicely made. The pages are glossy, and it comes covered with a nice dust jaket thats reversible. It's really all to bad, because I really miss reading the series and im not the kind of person that reads books over again, but this is the next best thing to read until the Cavornous Carnival... I only reccomend it becasue it looks good on the shelf with the S,O,U,Es books....and its a Lemony Snicket product."
1,"An expensive joke, part 2","Lemony Snicket is the pen name for D.Handler, whose intention was to become a novelist of adult fiction, and ended up getting a deal for a childrens book under this pretend name L.Snicket. So this book is just a big long joke. There is no L Snicket, of course. And the book is sort of stupid."
1,Wrong Description,"The Metra 82-4400 is 6.5 inch rings, not 5.25 inch as the description says. After looking through related listings, it does not appear that Metra even makes that size."
4,Average speaker spacers,"Only 6 1/2"" speaker spacers on amazon, they do the job nicely. I did have to drill new mounting holes, but it took less than 5 seconds to drill each one."
4,"Works fine with 6.5"" speakers","The plastic is a little cheap feeling, but they are cheap so that's expected. These work fine with 6.5"" speakers. I don't see how you could possibly use them for 5.25"" though."
2,Not what I was expecting,These spacers were advertised for 5 1/4 inch speakers yet they were made for 6 1/2 inch speakers. My 5 1/4 inch speakers barely fit into the holes and I ended up making my own spacers with mdf.
4,"a Bisque Microwave Still Exists, Yayyy!","I wanted to order the Whirpool Bisque Microwave that was a step up from this one, but it was out of stock everywhere, so I ordered this one. (A local salesman told me that this color was going to be hard to find because everyone wants black, white or stainless steel!) Eeyuk! The microwave doesn't have a bunch of fancy stuff on it, but it's fast and cooks pretty evenly. It looks really nice in my old farmhouse kitchen too. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is all plastic, so tends to move when I push the buttons. The open/close button tends to stick-but pops out shortly. The microwave is a little noisy, but so far, I like it, and I'm happy I got it. Wow, it really shipped fast and no shipping costs too-woo hoo!"
1,Very disappointing.,"I bought this unit based on good reviews here and on Consumer Reports. I was very disappointed. I am sending it back, despite having to eat the shipping costs.I should have suspected things weren't going to go well when I found a cigarette butt tucked into the plastic bag containing the manual. But I went ahead and installed the unit in my cabinet, using the recommended trim kit.The oven and the trim kit were both stainless steel, but did not match each other. Also the styling is not attractive -- the stainless steel on the oven has a lot of bends that give it a very institutional look. It would fit right in in a school cafeteria, but really did not look good in my kitchen.And, the nail in the coffin was the noise. This thing sounded like a 30-year old Volkswagen coming down the road.I won't be buying any more Whirlpool products."
4,A New Tale of Camelot,"When the magic burns out in Camelot, hope seems virtually gone from the land. Yet where there is the slightest spark, hope will always rise again. And so it is with this new tale of Camelot. The descendants of the original knights of the Round Table are called together once again to save the kingdom. Each knight faces perilous obstacles in his quest to get to Camelot. And once the Truest of Knights releases Excalibur from the stone, only with the Magic Orchid will the true magic be restored to the land. An intriguing storyline, a new tale of Camelot."
3,It's OK but be careful,"I ordered the Super Step Bench to use while lifting free weights. I've used it for bench presses, etc. The first time I used it for heel lifts the bench fell off its support and I ended up on the floor with a badly bruised knee. I haven't had any other stability problems with the equipment. The bench was supposed to be shipped with an exercise DVD - no DVD was with the bench. When I asked for the DVD, I was sent a replacement bench which also lacked a DVD."
2,Not so well done,"I purchased this item based on the two previous reviews. I anticipated seeing this DVD as I was thinking that this would be the answers to Indian style cooking that I lacked. After viewing this DVD twice I have to say I learned nothing from it.The video is poorly done, as is the audio. The explanation of the procedures to Indian cooking is very vague. The views of the spices and ingredients are all done by ""cookie-cutter"" methods meaning you see the same video shots of the same spices and food in every recipe presented. The hosts' use of broken English is quite distracting.I would pass up this DVD and purchase the Complete Vegetarian Cooking DVD's from Kurma Das."
2,One piece of research on cooperative learning.,This book may be more of interest to researchers than teachers/ principals engaged in cooperative learning.The findings on CL would be more suitable for a journal article.
2,"Great title, tedious book","I loved the title of this book so much that I decided to read the book. I was hoping for ""Natalie Goldberg meets Writer's Digest,"" in other words, the inspiration of Goldberg with the practicality of the magazine. Unfortunately, I found the book to be dry and uninspiring.This book was written in a semi-engaging matter, but most of the chapters are nothing new, and didn't have the spark of many other writing books I've read. For a good writing experience, read Natalie Goldberg's ""Writing Down the Bones,"" but skip HOW TO WRITE WITH THE SKILL OF A MASTER AND THE GENIUS OF A CHILD.Well, you can read the title again a few times, if you want."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,It never worked - it isn't even cost effective to return it. Do NOT purchase this product.
3,Does not actually charge your phone,"This 'charger' lets you talk on the phone in the car, so it supplies immediate power. However, it does not charge your phone. At this price, that is good enough for me. I use it all the time on my way home from work!"
5,Great grinder,"This coffee grinder is worth every penny. It runs well, and is made like my kitchen aide mixer(which I've had for about 25 years and counting). I forgot how great fresh ground coffee is. It is very easy to use and you can grind enough ahead of time for the week. Highly recommend this one."
2,beautiful but flawed,"It certainly looks impressive on the countertop but performance is decidedly sub-par.Pros: quieter than competition, ingenious grounds collection system on the bottom - neat and easy, grounds are not electrostatically charged, Kitchenaid bulletproof construction.Cons: Hopper is too small, but more importantly, poorly designed - the beans get caught up so there is frequent need to stick something in there to unclog it. Furthermore, the grinder itself clogs at times, requiring emptying and partial disassembly.To think we mothballed our longtime workhorse (awesome but loud) Bodum (similar style) for a pretty young new thing! A lesson to us all!"
5,Kitchen Aid Burr Grinder,"Works perfect, had the flaws listed in previous reviews, but for the $$, nothing beats it..Find one...Buy It!"
4,great no problems,"I boughtthis bur grinder because it was selling for 99.00, When I recieved it the lid didn't fit,buuuttt. I called kitchen aid customer service and they sent out a new one, I even got to choose the color I really wanted. The lid still doesn't fit really tight, but in a honesty you should be storing the beans long term in the hopper."
5,RED DEVIL GRINDER,"Amazing construction and performance. This is a discontinued unit (red model) and the price started out at Christmas for around $99.00. I got mine at the start of April for $129.00 (shipping included). Some minor design issues mentioned in other reviews.......so what? Kitchen Aid will no longer respond to requests for upgrade parts but that does not diminish the machine, it's still an excellent grinder and if you can find one I recommend you buy it."
2,One shot video,"Somewhat freeform demonstration and exercise. Not the detailed, slow motion, structured video I expected depicting, as the title states, the singular move of striking the ball with the instep. Actually somewhat more of an advanced move than I was looking for.The video definately displayes the eclectric nature of the instructor/star, Alexi Lalas - he is personable, patient, and sincere. Some people will immediately like his personality and style, some won't."
2,You do not find pages stuck together in a book of good condition,Ordered a book that was listed in good condition but several pages were stuck together and tore when they were opened.
2,Not a practical guide,"While being easy to read, this book is not exactly the ""practical guide"" that some may be looking for. This book is more about history and stories than ""how to"". The actual writing, leaves a bit to be desired as well. For anyone looking for a book oriented more toward Tantra, I would recommend ""Tantra: The art of concious loving""."
1,Kind of awful,"I bought these yesterday because my awesome $5 set broke. I do not like them. They are uncomfortable and will not stay in my ear. The part that goes up over my ear is too big and does not fit. The speaker is too big and hurts my ear. I would not recommend these to anyone, ever. Maybe my head is too small. I don't know. I do know that I'm going to go find another $5 set. Oh yeah. If you really want these you can get them at Target for $13!"
3,They don't fit,"These headphones don't fit anyone in our family. I originally bought them for my son because he was having a problem keeping earbuds in his ears but they didn't fit him, or me, or anyone else. The quality seems fine and if they fit you they may be a good buy. They just didn't work for us."
1,Awful!,"They don't stay put! I was just sitting at my desk working and they fell out multiple times. Very poorly designed, and terrible for 'active use.' Besides that they hurt my ears, probably from having to replace them multiple times and trying to get them to stay put."
3,They sound amazing but keep breaking,These would be my favorite headphones if they didn't break consistently. I ordered these at least 4 times already and they always break. I know its stupid to keep ordering the same pair but the sound quality is unbeatable for the price. They sound like expensive head phones for much less. Too bad they don't last.
2,doesn't stay on,Solid audio quality but these do not stay on (slip during jogging). I was disappointed but I guess I just didn't get lucky in terms of finding the perfect headphones for me. They could be perfect for someone I guess (the ones with ears that they can stay on).
3,"no sermons, good h.c. updated breakdowns","hey all,KYI have earned a good reputation because they put on a great live show and have good lyrical content, which strays from the usual ""my crew, your crew"" ""we're straight edge etc..."" subject matters that makes some h.c. preachy, and turns some listeners away. I think this album is better than their previous release. At times this comes off sounding like Avail, which is certainly nothing to be ashamed of. Some people think the recent rise of MetalCore bands are true h.c. bands, but Metal riffs are for...Metal! KYI don't bother writing ""tough guy"" breakdowns, and go for melody, which makes their songs memorable. This album has an ""old school"" h.c. feel, but the breakdowns are updated, and melodic. No gimmicks Needed...indeed! energetic, and personal, non-preachy lyrics make this album enjoyable. After all, nobody wants to listen to a sermon! enjoy."
3,"Okay Baby Book - a review of ""Train"" by Chris L. Demarest","Three Stars. This is a sturdy little board book which focuses on a train that goes 'over' and 'through' to bring a little girl home to her mother. Other concepts that it covers are: flow, glow, clang, blast, front and back. It has a rhyme which makes it a good read-aloud, and in general it would be appropriate for older babies and youngsters under the age of two.Here are some sample lines so you can get a feel for the text.Train chugs,Clickity-clackEngine up frontCaboose in backPass farmsCows mooOver hillsChoo! Choo!I read this to a friends 15-month old and he was fairly entertained. But having read dozens of such books I can't say that I can rate it higher than average as there are many other books that have more to point at, more to teach, and better artwork."
4,"Melodic with different type of lyrics - personal, yet universal","I found this by accident - the songs are solid and after hearing the songs and arrangements, I then began to hear the lyrics. It is likely to appeal to Crowded House fans, I feel. Josh sings in an Australian accent, which always catches the ear, maybe because I'm Australian. Too many singers adopt American pronunciation when vocalising, presumably to sell more records internationally. Josh is a welcome change in this respect. If you get a chance to hear this record, take it."
5,A Border Collie owners must- read,"This book is the most acurate,informative book on Border Collies Ive ever seen and as I own Border Collies I find it excellent.It tells you all you need to know from how to train/feed/raise a puppy, to breeding a litter of your own, how to show a Border Collie, Genetics, explaining everything in a clear easy to understand way.I frequently delve into to my copy if I need to find something specific or just to go over a part again. I recommend it very highly to anyone who owns a Border Collie as you will enjoy it over and over again.The author is speaking from many years experience and is very down to earth."
5,Lets get a few things straight....,"Many people have a tendency to speak about things that they have no prior info about the subject. I see that is the case here. here are the facts.-For over 25 years, even to is death, Tookie denies killing those 4 people.-Tookie has apologiezed for creating the crips.-He has tried to undo what he helped create by writing books.[Why he should have been saved]Tookie didn't want clemecy because he thought it was a better punishment for him. He wanted it so he couls continue his work. I am a ""At-Risk"" teenager, and I personally would listen to the creator of the crips about gangs, rather than listen to some white guy in a tie. Even if he did do the crimes that he was charged with, who are we to say he deserves to die? Last time I checked, someone named God makes those decisions."
2,Fairly predictable,"Like I said in my title for this review. It is a fairly predictable pattern of a life gone bad under poor socioeconomic circumstances. The questions always to keep in mind are: ""How many growing up in that environment do not turn to this lifestyle? and...""What about the victims?"" It is easy to forget them when victims like Tookie et al have the last word to present things their way.The writing is fairly predictable in choice of words and the style in which it is written. Nothing highly literary or linguistically unique or compelling in the writing, but then it the truth probably shouldn't be so very stylized just to make it more poetic or for a more memorable turn of phrase."
1,Brian C,"The other reviews are correct in that you have to read this book with an open mind. It appears all the reviews for this book were written by followers and friends of Tookie. Like I said, you have to really keep an open mind when reading it, knowing that it was written by a murderer who claims redemption but doesn't admit to his crime. Even the things he does admit, and profit from, lilke forming the Crips, he never fully achieves redemption. If so, then he would have cooperated with law enforcement to help dismantle the very gangs he preaches to children about not joining. He has not even so much as given up any other gang-bangers that he witnessed committing crimes. Its clear to see where his loyalties still lie. If I had to do it again, I would borrow the book to read so I wouldn't have to spend my money on it."
1,ANNOYED,"I was enjoying the read until I got to page 46 then it jumped to page 111, at which time it jumped back to 79 after page 130. This really sucked because I will never know what happened between those pages; i feel it is a significant part to building the plot"
1,Purchased this book,"I purchased this book quite a while ago for my son to read. Unfortunately, this book had pages missing, it went to page 75, then skipped to page 100. I should have sent it back. It went out with the trash!!! Hope to purchase this book somewhere else."
1,Redemption?,"Tookie Williams murdered at least four individuals in cold blood. These people did not have the benefit of a trial by jury, appeals, due process, habeas corpus review, a clemency hearing, celebrity support, a visit by Jessee Jackson, or a even painless death.Tookie Williams claims personal redemption in his book, but has never owned up to committing the murders or aided the authorities in shutting down the criminal enterprise he co-founded.To be redeemed is to be cleared of the consequences of sin. By definition, one cannot be redeemed if one does not own up to ones sins. In failing to do so in this book, Tookie fails to even approach redemption.If any of Tookie Williams' writings dissuade anyone from a life in the violent criminal gangs Tookie helped create, that's good. But it is also good, and just, that the sentence of the people in the State of California be carried out."
1,NOT FUN For Children,This book comes with pre-printed pages that you actually make the Pokemon characters with. The paper is SO flimsy that my 9 year old son was unable to even tear out a piece without it ripping to shreds. Because of the poor paper quality these characters are impossible to make. I am referring to a 9 year old child who is an artist & especially gifted with his hands and quite accomplished at Origami. I would give this 0 stars if that was an option and would return it if I had purchased it from an actual store. No Fun!
4,Machiavel - 'Jester' (Spalax),"Originally released in 1977, this was the Belgium - progressive band's second record. Tracks that make this CD reissue definitely worth a listen are the inspiring ""Wisdom"", ""Sparkling Jaw"", title cut ""The Jester"" and the ten-minute ""Rock, Sea And Tree"". Personnel: Mario Guccio - sax, flute, clarinet & vocals, Jean-Paul Devaux - guitar, 6 and 12-string acoustic guitar & vocals, Roland De Greef - bass, bells, tape effects & vocals, Albert Letecheur - grand & electric piano, mellotron, synthesizer & tubular bells and Marc Ysaye - drums, tamborine, maracas & gong. Great instumental passages - here and there - even though the music here is good, it's really not my thing. Just might appeal to fans of Ange, Eloy and possibly open-minded fans of Yes or Supertramp."
5,Far exceeded expectations,"I have seen products similar to this for substanially more money. When this one arrived, it could easily rival one of the more expensive models. The plastic top detracts a bit from the overall look, but serves its purpse well. The remainder is beautifully constructed. The drawers are lined in black fabric like a jewelry box. It looks like it cost much more than it did. I thought I would tuck this away in a corner of my office, but it is so attractive I will probably have it front and center."
1,what a piece of junk,"this has got to be to most poorly manufactured item i have bought in a long time. Six of the plastic deviders were either cut too short so they wont fit into both groves spanning the opening, or were bowed in an arc shape. So my 31 day monthly organizer is now a 16 or 17 day organizer. You would think that someone would check the quality of something they are going to attach their name too and sell."
4,Excellent product,This product came in excellent condition. I think that the guy who got the bad one should have just returned it for another. Everyone is entitled to one bad one of the bunch! The only assembly I had to do was to re-adjust the plastic dividers. I ordered it May 25th and received it May 26th. Very fast shipping!! I'm very pleased.
5,Christopher Lowell true to his name,I have C.L. office furniture. This bill organizer was the perfect addition. It came completely assembled and in excellent condition. For the price it is a fantastic value. I am 100% pleased. It is exactly what I needed.
2,Maybe some flowers or a tissue box instead of dividers,"I would have to agree with the problem of the dividers to separate the dates, it just doesn't work. I didn't send it back because it really goes with my desk and I do like the two small drawers. Maybe I can fit some nice flowers or a decorative tissue box or something in the top bin and place mail somewhere else. I wouldn't have put my name on this thing. Does anyone out there need extra plastic dividers for this thing? You can have mine."
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT,"NICELY MADE, JUST WHAT I WANTED EXCEPT, THE ""STICK-ON"" IS A STICK-ON PAPER, NOT SUCTION CUPS. WHICH, IS WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS. I CAN'T SEE HOW THE PAPER WOULD LAST WELL FOR TRAVEL. TAKING THE MIRROR OFF AND ON REPEATEDLY. I RETURNED THE MIRROR AND THE SELLER WAS KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE ME BACK A FULL REFUND, INCLUDING SHIPPING."
2,"Tiny mirror, suction cups don't hold","The usable portion of the magnifying mirror, while optically correct, turns out to be a tiny 3-1/2"" in diameter, too small to serve as a shaving mirror. In addition, I'd planned to stick it on my plate glass mirror as needed, but the suction cups do not hold it up. Didn't try the peel-off sticky pad, but that wouldn't have served my purpose. Seller did not pay for return shipping."
4,Great help after age 50.,I would be totally lost without this mirror. It allows me to see more clearly my many imperfections. Makeup is a wonderful thing.
4,One of a Kind!,"Once again, GT Interactive has produced a game unlike any other. This game takes racing to a new level. Anyone who has experienced dirt track racing first hand will appreciate the job done by GT to put out a game like this. Not only does this game have it all, it has it all at the low price that has become synonomous with GT Interactive games. Players can choose from stock, pro stock, and late model cars as well as a large variety of tracks from the simple oval to the challenging figure 8. Accumulate money from wins to buy new parts for your car and make your way through the season to become champion. Just another great product put out by the game developers at GT Interactive"
3,be careful!,I put this on my cat tightly so she could spend some time outside on a (non chocking )tether but 10 min later her mouth got stuck in the collar area. Only put this on your cat with careful supervison.
5,Fallon has beautiful coloring and is a collector favourite,"You know it is the doll collectors who are driving up prices on these dolls. Fallon is a particular favorite with doll collectors as her coloring is much prettier than it looks in the scan. She is hard to find and you need to get one while you can before we Barbie collectors get them all.Sorry , kids !"
2,I don`t like her so much..,She doesn`t look a lot like Fallon in the movie and I hate her legs too.I don`t like her hair or dress either.Even Princess Genevieve isn`t as bad as her!
2,Not for our child,"We really wanted this laptop to work--for our child, as a birthday gift, and for another child in the world, who, presumably, would need it more than ours. We received it in December and it has been a colossal flop. Hard for children and grownups (very computer-literate grownups) to navigate. The child cannot use it--she ends up in tears of frustration. The adults were looking forward to using it, even the Linux system--but no. No go. How do I return this thing? I hope there is support for the other child in the world who got this thing--we are unsupported, unhappy, and have only a cool looking green paperweight here in our home."
1,Ugh ... waste of time,"First I thought the one laptop per child would be a wonderful idea ... so I ordered one from the website, and sent one to a under-privileged child somewhere. I wanted to see for myself what this device would be like, and if there was any useful software development to be done on it.I got mine about a week ago, and it is terrible. It is way too slow. There is no documentation ... except on the web ... and it is far too poor and useless.The device is a nice size, but the keyboard and keys will be problematic, I guess this is so one can only type very slow so the device can keep up ... my toy computer of 20 years ago was better than this and cost about the same.I am sorry to say but I have to predict that this idea is going down in flames. It will be worse than useless to children and everyone who has anything to do with it. Not even a nice try. What a sad waste of time and materials."
2,Great story but this edition is not suitable for reading on the kindle,"The Made Easy Version is good for students as it helps with translation of the language. However, reading this version on the kindle is difficult because you have to keep searching for the page which matches your old English version or your translated version."
3,Better than Classics Illustrated,"The Shakespeare Made Easy series is a convenient way to make sure you understand the plot of each play. The current English ""translation"" is set out on the opposite page of the original language. You get the words but you don't get the meaning, the feeling, the essence that has kept these works alive for centuries. However, if this is your first exposure to Shakespeare, you at least learn the story which is usually better than the plots of most 21st century movies."
3,okay,to tell you the truth i never finished the bottle because im horrible at taking pills (ADD?) lol but truthfully i dont see how these would of worked anyway
2,not sure,"This stuff upset my stomach so bad, after a few weeks I couldn't take it anymore. So I have no idea if it actually works. So I'm nuetral on it. I'm not going to sit and bash it or talk it up, I have no idea if it works."
2,doesn't work good,I have seen no increase in bra. I got this because its cheap. But its a waste of time. So I would get these pill. The only reason I didnt give a one start is because there wasn't to many effects but I did gain about 4 pounds because of these pills.
4,"Nice Bag, but no frills","This is a nice simple bag for a low price. It is a good, sturdy material and has nice long straps. I like the pockets on the side, however they are way too small for a lot of larger size water bottles. It also has no pockets or zippers inside so if you need a bag that closes, you are out of luck. It is a good bag for taking to the beach or the gym, and maybe to class. The seller is great and the shipping was really fast (faster than Amazon even). Overall I give it four stars out of five because for the price it is a nice bag, but I could use bigger and more secure pockets."
4,"Simple, easy to use","My wife bought this product and it seems to be just what she had hoped for. It's very lightweight so it's easy to move or put away. No tools needed to add or subtract a step - just lift it off. It also seems strong enough that it will last for a long time.When you think about it, this is probably a bit expensive for what it actually is: a couple pieces of hollow, colored plastic. It doesn't have any padding or even rubber on the top - it's just plastic. I suppose you could use cinder blocks and get the same type of ""system"" for about $4. But, this is much easier to move around and store than a few cinder blocks. :)We have not yet watched the included workout DVD."
2,I don't use it anymore,"Tried to use it couple times, but the chair works much better than this.There are 5 separate parts, which very easily come off.I had to stopmany times during workout to fix it. No, don't like it at all"
3,too short,"this bench isn't long enough for me to get a workout in. I let my daughter use it though, she enjoys it."
2,Not updated,Step too small for my size feet. Outdated video I feel like I stepped into the 1990's. wish they ad sent better programs
2,Not your step from the gym!,"I was excited when I received my step and Cathe DVD. This step is not as long as the ones that I used at the local gym. It's an ideal step for someone who is shorter (I am 5'9"") and fell off the sides a few times when I sadly attempted to use it for my Step workout. I decided to keep it and use it for my strength training workout (i.e. step ups, decline push ups, etc). The quality of the step is great, but wish it was longer to accommodate my height."
2,Step F1004 Workout System,"This step is ok, but much smaller than the one we use in workout class. The small size really limits what I can do with it. But it works fine for very basic step moves."
4,Should have gotten the one with rubber on the top,"Not a bad step at all, just make sure your sneakers have excellent rubber soles or you could possibly slip on the top because there is no rubber to grasp the shoe."
1,It was shipping without the original packaging.,I was very disappointed that the Step Workout System came without the original box and was packed loose in a brown packing box. In the description it showed the original packaging and also a DVD that was in a plastic enclosed case. The DVD that came was in a loose sleeve that it had fallen out of during the shipping.
1,used and incomplete,My box had obviously been opened before and did NOT contain the DVD it is listed to include. Waste of my money.
3,A bit shorter than I had imagined.,This step isn't as long as a basic aerobics step but I suppose it will do. Shipped in a timely manner.
1,Someone Who Cares,"In my opinion this book presents a judgemental and critical view of people, Church, and God. I mean the whole message of Jesus Christ is love because God is love. Its claim that we must hate in order to love is unfounded(I John 3:15). The Bible is more full of the message of love(John 15:12-13, Galatians 5:22, Romans 13:8). I can only pray that the Spirit of truth would come over all who read this and show it for what it is. A doctrine can not be based on one scripture alone, that is taken out of context. I will continue to pray that anyone that reads this book will cling to God who is love and is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow."
1,someone else who cares,"This is a book I would not recommend anyone read. It is full of exactly what its title says--hatred. We are called to love one another and if we do not, the Bible says we do not love God, we are murderers, and we dwell in darkness(1 John 4:20, 1 John 3:15, 1 John 1:9-11) God hates sin. He loves all people but hates the sin in their lives. This book teaches to hate people. It's foundation is built on one scripture--Luke 14:26 which is one of the parables of Jesus. We see in the Scriptures that Jesus often spoke in parables not to be taken literally but to be discerned by the Holy Spirit Who dwells within us. There were times that Jesus would question why His own disciples did not understand what He was trying to say. Was it because they were looking at the surface instead of the deeper meaning? Yes."
5,Burnout 3 is the S**T!,"Awsome game, but here is the tip. you can get it for way less at the ea web page. twenty bucks or so. sorry amazon for screwing with your business. lol"
5,What do you do with this kind of game?,"What is Burnout3?A simulated game in real traffic with modified cars.Similar to Thrill Driver 2 of the local arcades.How to evade other cars?Nearing to a car, turn right or leftWhat is impact mode?Introduced from Burnout 2 Point Of Impact.You can steer the car while it's in air.What are the kinds of cars?Answer a stupid boy's question:1. Compact:For beginners-experts2. Muscle: Advanced-experts3. Sports: Advance-Experts4. Super: Advanced-experts5. Special Car: Any6. Heavy Weight: Designed for crash.Takedowns, what are they?Takedowns are the game's special since takedown is introduced in Burnout 3.Signature takedowns, what's that?Again I answer the stupid boy:Signature takedowns are special takedowns. Like Gone Fishin' and Pillar Driller.Music, what are the genres?1. Punk Rock2. Rock"
5,bbbbbrrom,yeah ok so it's kinda childish and it does get old after a couple of hundred races but the first few hundred are priceless. the music is really annoying and i want to stab the commentator but i'm just having so much fun playing it i can't help but give it 5 stars..
4,not as good as revenge.,you should be able to crash into cars.... its just not as fun when you cant.
1,poor,"My video is not working, I had to make an additional purchase of the harddrive to play the game and the game is still not playing. I am so dissatisfied.Burnout 3 Takedown"
3,Burnout 3,"This game is not what i expected, once you get behind in a race your are pretty much the loser. I guess it just takes some practice. I like it, but i prefer to play burnout revenge."
5,Burnout 3 is AWESOME!!,"I have played the 2nd Burnout game and the 4th and I think that this one is the best. It's lots of crash up fun and you can run races to. So if you like to drive cool cars and race or drive MONSTER vehicles and crash into stuff then this is the game for you!! Earn boost by wrecking other cars in race mode, earn while you burn for making wreckless moves in a race!! Don't want to race? Then check your Crash Nav for the nearest intersection to crash into and see how much damage you can cause and cash you can earn for all the havoc you just reaked!! Try Road Rage!! Tell me that you have'nt felt like this out on the highway!! LOL! It's a great STRESS reliever!! So what are you waiting for?? Start BURNING with Burnout 3 Takedown!!"
4,BURNOUT 3,"THIS GAME WORKS PERFECTLY. IT'S ALMOST LIKE I JUST GOT IT FROM THE STORE INSTEAD OF FROM AMAZON,COM."
5,Great Game,Don't listen to the players who say this is not a good game. There is lots of fun stuff on it even if you some how you don't like something. I have play this game alot and could play it all day every day no problem. If you have problems with the 20 sec if that load times then I sorry but sometimes putting such cool stuff and graphis in a game it may take a sec. more to load. This is a five star game!! I am also a pickey gamer but I realize what gos into a game as well.
3,Fast! Flawed.,"The graphics on this game are really quite nice. When you're going fast, you feel like you're going fast. And the crash game is addicting. Watching the slow motion explosions is a highlight. I only wish it didn't take so long to load up between tries. Another complaints are that there aren't enough courses. And the computer cars are always right behind you. If I'm racing perfectly, then screw up at the last turn, I should be way ahead. The computer cars cheat too much here. And I keep getting all these new cars for winning races, but I CAN'T USE THEM! That's a real weak situation."
2,CHEATING at its best,"it's cheat time with Burnout 3:Takedown. i completely agree with the reviewer Fitz. read Fitz's review, he thoroughly explains how this cheats in the extreme in detail. by the way, to all the programmers of this game at EA. GO TO HELL!!!! YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF MORONS. IF YOU CAN'T DESIGN A GAME TO PROVIDE LEGITIMATE COMPETITION WITHOUT CHEATING, YOU'RE NOT VERY ADEPT PROGRAMMERS ARE YOU?"
4,pretty good game,The A.I in this game really stinks i mean if they wreak and they are 20 seconds behind you then 2 seconds later they are right on your but that means they must be double your speed.Great game though i gave it 1 1/2 thumbs up
4,Burnsssss the competion,"I was surprised to hear burnout 3 sold more copies than gran turismo 4 overall. I mean burnout 3 is alot more fun, but gran turismo is better overall but who gives a crap. Burnout 3 is a offroad fury of fun. The Burnout World tour features up to 40 Race tracks and 67 unlockable Vehicles and a crapload of gamemodes. With online play, no wonder it killed in the rankings. There new mode is called takedown. You try to takedown your oppenent racer by hitting him/her off a road and making him crash. The cars are carfully designed and each one can be used to help you in your inmassed world tour. And intentionally crashing into people never gets old. Its not far from perfect, but it is still a great game. I give it a solid 4 stars.Positive side+ large varity+ Great graphics+ online play+ running into people never gets oldNegitive Side- Clumsy driving Controls- Long loads"
4,Good but something's missing....,"This is a really cool game. What game do you know that is just begging you to crash that car into that truck and see how big of an explosion you could make? I have gotten up to 104 crashes on the demo and real game. My top for demo was 103 and the real game was 104. Yes I am a good player on it considering I beat a guy with a high score of 132. Good game, okay on the music, awsome graphics, awsome sound when I hook it up for surround sound and pump up da base, and over all just a awsome game."
5,One of the best books I've found on the western Germanic tribes,"This book is fantastic and very readable for the layman. It is packed with info about the Franks, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Frisians and more, including the late Romans. My family came from Marne on the Jutland Peninsula and I learned an incredible amount of information about HOW they got to Britain and where they settled there. It is FASCINATING. The info concerning clinker built prototype longships like the Nydam Ship is jaw-dropping. Folks, the Viking lonship and the medieval caravel din not appear out of thin air and this book traces their Germanic and Roman origins. All I can say is that if you're into this subject or the western Germanic tribes, period...BUY THIS BOOK! THIS EDITION IS OUT OF PRINT, BUT IT HAS BEEN REISSUED."
4,Presently meets expectation,"I think it's too early for a good evaluation, but at this time it is fine. I expect it to last longer than 120 volt ones."
3,A Book for Looking,"This is a beautiful book. One should write out the recipes and never take the book near a kitchen. It did not meet my needs. I bought it as a hostess gift for the cousin who hosts me, and as many as 12 others who are alone for Thanksgiving dinner. The recipes sound delicious but they are not for a large number of people who expect lots of basic good (like Grandma's feast)food. I would recommend this book to someone who wanted to really wow an intimate group of fellow gourmets. And to those who love to read cookbooks, like myself. On a practical note, for the size and price, it didn't have many recipes. There are ingredients not found in a small mountain town. This book would be a nice addition to a cookbook collection, make a nice hostess gift for a book lover, but is not suited as a go-to cookbook. It's a one-menu book."
3,Good book,"Overall, this is a very nice book, with beautiful pictures and easy to follow instructions. I really appreciate the different variations of the same dish (e.g. different ways to cook the turkey). however, i bought this book hoping I would find traditional dishes that I tasted last year (sweet potatoes, potato rolls) and could not find them in the book so i was a little bit disappointed....But it's a good book nonetheless!"
2,It's ok,Didn't really need this one for the book shelf. I've actually found better recipes in my cooking magazines. The shiper did their part and got it to me in a timely manner and the book arrived in the condition promised.
1,Misrepresented,"This product was clearly a clearance item that was damaged and beat up, although it was being sold as new. I sent the first one back as it was a gift, and the replacement came in worse shape than the original. The book jacket was crumpled and had several price stickers on the back, one on top of the other that I couldn't get off. When I took the damaged book jacket off, thinking I could use it that way, the binding was all dented like it had been dropped. Both books came like this....I was so disappointed. If I had purchased it as used or 'as is', I would understand, but not listed as new."
1,Useless,"Useless because it has most unuseful idioms and expressions that are never used in French. It lacks also many basic business WORDS not to mention expressions, sayings and stuff. Out of 30 times I needed to translate a french expression into American, I got: - 20 times the word or expression was just not there - 5 times the examples listed did not apply (mainly because examples are related to finance, not business) - 5 times it was somewhat accurate (but I had to double-check with my american co-workers).Don't make the same mistake I made believing that since the last edition is pretty recent, a lot would be updated. Save your money and just try something else."
5,i love the story line it is great how he writes insuchdeatil,the trolls are great the wolvies are great the warrors triads are great. i wish you would print the rest of the series my brother gave me the first and third books of the series their the olny books i'll read david robbins will you please write some more.
5,excellent book,"This book and the rest of the books in this series that I have had a chance to read are some of the best books I have ever read. Post apocolyptic (sorry if misspelled)stories are rare and few, and the only ones that I have read that are similar are the Deathlands series and the Gunslinger series by Stephen King. I really like how the writer breaks down the description of the compound that the ""family"" live in. I also like the detail he puts into describing the weapons and guns that the ""warriors"" carry. The author needs to write more books to this series, and the publisher of these books need to republish these stories. I have looked all over the place for these books and they are very hard to find. Amazon must get a hold of the rest of this series.Rizzo, Frank"
2,Disappointing,"Two stars is probably a little harsh, but I couldn't bring myself to give it a full 3 (implying it was an average read).The premise was fairly interesting. The characters (in the first few chapters) were interesting - until I realized I had learned everything I was going to ever learn about them in those first few chapters. The beginning was pretty strong, but it fizzled rather quickly. It was just barely good enough to keep me reading, thinking ""it has to get better"".... Only it didn't.By the time I realized it wasn't going to get any better, I was close enough to the end to see it through just on principle.It's not the worst book I've ever read, it's just in the bottom third."
1,Junk,This gun only lasted for 15 minutes straight out of the box before a seal blew internally. I had to go and buy a Ridgid at Home Depot so I could finish up the job. Avoid Stanley and buy a quality tool!
5,Stanley SRN175,What a great tool. Have used more expensive mod. They had nothing on this tool. Used some old coils that were in the shape of a square and still no jams. I dont know why the price is so low but I am glad I took advantage of the deal.
1,not professional grade,I was disappointed in the performance of the Stanley Roofing Nailer. I expected that it would be able to do what I asked which was to nail new shingles on a new roof. It didn't drive the nails in and the air pressure was 90lbs. as is normal with my other Bostich roofing guns. Turning the pressure up did not improve the performance and I had to retire the tool on the first job. I thought the Stanley brand which is associated with Bostich would mean the tool was ready for prime time. I was wrong.
5,Crew Socks,"Just purchased these for the Susan G Koman 3 day walk. Prior to this walk I ususally just purchased cotton socks. These socks were great, nice open weave for wicking (a new term for me!) and very comfortable. I would recommend for anyone looking for comfort, not too thick and dry feet."
5,rugged and long life,"I did not buy these from Amazon but since I own a pair I thought I'd give you my review. I have had a pair of these living under my deck for the past nine years. I finally crawled under there to take them down and clean them today. Let's just say I live in a challenging climate. I'm perched on a hilltop in a wooded area of the pacific northwest rain forest. I've been subject to heavy snows, hurricane winds, freezing rain, and constant rains three quarters of the year. I have left these speakers outside this whole time and surprisingly they still sound great. I have them powered by a 100 watt Onkyo. They seem to have crisp highs and decent bass. They were a bit stained but that's my own fault for leaving them year round. But hey nine years and still cranking in this climate. amazing."
5,Great in many settings,"I've had a pair of Outrigger Juniors for 8 years in two different homes in three different settings. Originally purchased for outdoor use they spent 4 summers on a 1200 square foot deck at 8,000 feet above sea level, then as a indoor bookshelf speaker, and finally as a wall-mounted indoor tv / streaming audio micro-system speaker. They've performed well in every setting. Smooth, engaging mids and highs with often surprising bass. They're a tad on the power-hungry side but fine for normal levels with a 25-40 watt amplifier. Highly recommended for the price (I paid $225 for the pair in 2004 -- no regrets)."
4,"Good story line, BUUUTT,","Let me just say that i did enjoy the book, i have read many faith based books that fiils your gills with plenty of hope and spirituality but EVERY SINGLE click of my kindle page was sometimes overboard. Don't get me wrong i think its great that the author is a born again christian and i truly got the point again and again. It almosted reminded me of someone knocking on your door and shoving the bible down your throat. The characters were hmmm good, the ending when Leota is in the hospital well i don't wanna give it away but talk about twisted, low and bizarre with what happened to her, WOW it nearly ruined the whole book, but if u think about it the author maybe trying to let us know that everything not pretty flowers in the world and beyond, that there is EVIL in us humans even tho the ones that r evil dont think they are."
5,Absolutely beautiful,I absolute love this book (Leota's garden) by Francine Rivers! It often really surprises me that it is not more popular.
2,Not in typical Francine fashion,"Francine Rivers is an amazing writer. For those who have not, you must readRedeeming Love and the Mark of the Lion series. That said, Leota' Garden did disappoint. I agree that it was unbelievably slow (I contemplated stopping prior to completion) and quite redundant. But, I'll give Francine Rivers a break...not every book can be a masterpiece."
3,Nice story - Too long!,"I picked up the book and sincerely looked forward to reading it. That said, I think the story could have ended about 125 pages sooner than it did. There is so much repetition...I became quite frustrated with it and just began scanning pages. Sorry I don't share the same love of the book as others here... it became a 400+ page tome when instead could have just been a story of life with all its many problems. I won't be keeping it in my collection."
3,"Good Writer, but..................","My wife wanted me to read this and I am glad she recommended it. A very good story and overall, well written. What bothered me was a lot of redundancy. Over and over again, the characters rehash the same questions and concerns in their mind. i.e. ""Why are you allowing this, Lord? Why? Why? Why?"" This is okay on occasion but got old really fast. All of the thoughts are in italics so I got to the point where I dreaded turning the page and seeing sentence after sentence of the same old thing. Now, again, a very nice story and very God honoring, but just wish the editors would have said, ""All right, Francine. We get the point."""
2,Where's the romance?,"I enjoyed the characters, the family secrets, and the struggle for reconciliation. However, the end was a big disappointment. I share the author's views on abortion and euthanasia, and I also appreciate the clear Gospel presentation outlined in the book. However, I already know what I believe about that stuff -- I wanted to read a good Christian romance novel! This one just strings you along without delivering in the end. Not that I wanted it to be predictable, but I was left wondering if there was a sequel or something. I guess the worst part is it makes you care for the characters, like Corban, and then to be so disappointed. I expected more. I hoped for a book as good as The Mark of the Lion series or Redeeming Love (also by Rivers, and some of the best books I've ever read). Rivers is gifted, but I wish she would have crafted a good story and not just used it as a political treatise, however much I agree with her causes."
5,Could Have Been Written for Caregivers,"LEOTA'S GARDEN is one of the finest books I have read recently, and I read a lot, mostly best-selling fiction. I had just read THE LAST SIN EATER and had paid no attentiion to the author's name (I am ashamed to say!). When I began reading LEOTA'S GARDEN and checked to see what other books Rivers had written, I thought to myself, ""Hey--that's why I liked it, also!"" Those of us who have lost our fathers and are now at least partially taking care of our mothers can identify with so many thoughts and ideas in this book, especially if we were close to our grandparents. I am now anxious to read earlier books written by this author."
5,Great read,This book reminds me of the Fruit of the Spirit.....it makes you think and it brings a newness to the verse...even though the Word is always newness....
5,I need a dozen!,"I truly wish I had a dozen of the book, ""Leota's Garden"", by Francine Rivers, to share with friends and family.This is good reading for any one with a troubled family relationship. Looking to the reasons behind behavior is something needed to understand behavior.."
2,Found it difficult to continue reading,The premise is good but the character development was flat and the plot was predictable. It was hard to finish and I was disappointed after the glowing reviews.
2,Should be re-classified,"I must admit I didn't make it all the way through this book merely because it became increasingly clear that it is quite religious in content. At the risk of being labeled a heretic, let me say, that I haven't anything against God or Christianity but they are not subjects I choose for my pleasure reading. Rivers is a gifted writer and the book clips along at a fast pace, but I kept expecting the daughter's fundamentalist Christian leanings to be called to question or justified in some manner rather than having her be, apparantly, the only character (at the point when I put the book down) with the luck to have learned, ""the good news about Jesus Christ."" Again, to each her own. Religion is welcome in my home but not under the guise of entertainment. I wish it had been more clear to me that this was the case. I dare not risk hate mail so I'd best remain anonymous."
1,Couldn't force myself to read another page. Zzzzzzzz...,"I loved River's book The Last Sin Eater so much that I wanted to try another book by her, and man, was this DISAPPOINTING. Talk about beating a dead horse. We GET that the mothers and daughters don't get along. And we GET that Leota and the young man college student don't get along. We don't need 4 millions examples of this. Just move the story along. I got about 100 pages into it (to the Thanksgiving dinner) and could not take it anymore. I was bored out of my mind!What I loved about The Last Sin Eater was that it taught me a lesson about faith without being so preachy about it. Leota's Garden tries too hard. Annie's sugary sweetness and her mother's overboard evilness were just too much. Totally unbelievable and uninteresting. BORING!"
1,insanely stupid and sad,why do these types of books have to be so steeped in suffering? didnt jesus suffer enough? for gods sake stop torturing your characters too...things just keep getting progressively worse for everyone...as if the point is god never grants any wish to anyone...even ontheir deathbed! i would hate to live in francines world...and such stupid narrowminded characters...such discrepancies...how can leota be so old? almost 40 years between her and nora...same stupid dialogue over and over...no respite...spare us please...stop writing
5,A story to remember,A wonderful story sure to be loved by all readers what ever their age. Leota's charcter has many dimensions and reveals a lot about the way elderly people feel in todays rapidly changing society. A page turner - I read it in about 2 days!
5,Leota' s Garden,"I loved this book. You'll need a box of tissues close by while reading it. It was filled with hope, encouragement and forgiveness."
5,"Beautiful story, a must read","The story here merges with my life in so many ways, it is a powerful read. From the minute you start the first page it draws you in, not letting you go until the last page is read. This is the first book I've read by Francine Rivers, but rest assured it won't be my last."
2,not what I had hoped for,Too many characters who did nothing to help themselves. Who can feel sorry for someone when all they do is wallow in their miserable circumstances? Also a very disappointing ending to all their grief.I would not recommend this book.
4,Excellent story if you don't mind the typing errors!,"1) I will first critique the book: I gave the story line 5 stars. It deals with verbal & emotional abuse in a very realistic way. As a victim of mental abuse, I found myself relating to Leota often. I even cried with her. The characters are well developed, and the book is engrossing. It is not your typical Christian novel where everyone in the book gets saved, which lent even more credibility to the plot. The author, however, did leave us hope that maybe someday salvation will come.2) Now onto the Kindle format: There are so many typos in the book, I found it quite distracting. Most of the errors have to do with spacing so I gave this part 3 stars which is how I calculated my 4 stars overall. Since I got the book for free, I didn't mind it too much. In fact, I found it well worth the price!"
3,"drags a lot, but pleasant","this is the longest it has taken me to get thru a book in a very long time. I appreciated the Christianity, but the story just dragged and dragged for me."
3,Mediocre,"This was the sixth book by Francine Rivers which I have read over the last year. Unlike most of the others (Redeeming Love, A Voice in the Wind) I found this one a little difficult to get involved in. The characters were slow to develop and it look me some time to really care about their journey, their past and their ultimate destination. By the end of the book, I found myself unsatisfied to the depth of the characters growth. I felt that there was room for more and it seemed to be a premature ending. Also I also felt that the minor characters didn't have a chance to reach their potential.However, like all of Francines Christian Fiction, I did take away an understanding of Christian morals, beliefs and values surrounding family and the aged in our community."
1,Lousy editing,"Lousy, lazy editing job! Come on, just because you're an established author is no excuse for such unbelievably substandard editing!"
3,"OK, tender, but not gripping.","Rivers has a gift, no doubt about it. But this story did not affect me as most of the others I have read."
5,Amazing Story,"This story was amazing! The characters came alive for me, and I just could not put the book down. The story has many lessons for the reader to learn. I feel that I have become a better person with more understanding of why people have their misunderstandings within the family circle. We all have some type of dysfunction in our lives, unless we come to realizing them can we focus on the TRUTH which sets us FREE!"
3,Nice Story. Just too slow!,"This is the second book I have read of Francine Rivers. I really did enjoy the story line, but at times it just dragged too slowly for my taste. I found myself pushing myself to finish, rather than being so intrigued in the story I could not put it down."
2,Didn't even finish it!,"Normally I will read anything and everything--and I rarely don't finish a book. This book, despite what struck me as interesting characters at the start, just petered out. The characters were not engaging enough to make me care about them, and the story line was just not strong enough to make up for the weak characters. I kept waiting for the story to really take off and get interesting, but it just never did."
1,Better things to do with my life,"As a guy who likes to complete a book from cover to cover, it was with difficulty that I consigned this part-read book to the ""Books I found Boring"" folder on my Kindle.I found it difficult to understand the characters' obsessions with the supernatural and kept wishing they would just get off their backsides and live life to the full.Like other reviewers I thought Leota's secret was contrived and one which could have been explained earlier to her daughter.I could not empathise with any of the characters, finding them superficial, self absorbed and often wallowing in their own self pity. I got about 50% into the book before realising that outside the sun was shining, the birds singing and the sea sparkling - so why did I need to drag myself down to their level of misery when it was time to get up and out - so I did!"
3,"Not bad, but somewhat offensive.","The plot of this book was interesting. It was pretty well written. Unfortunately I almost had to stop reading it due to a few anti-gay and slightly racist comments. I don't mind a religious book, but this author is obviously a very conservative religious person, and a little too judgemental for my taste."
3,Storyline gets lost..,"The storyline itself is a good one, and the main character Leota is very believable. From there, I felt the book went downhill. I had to pick it up several times -- it got slow, repetitious and redundant. There are so many loose ends that it makes you wonder if a follow up book might be in the works, but I didn't care enough about the rest of the characters to want to know what happens next. While I realize that Rivers is a Christian author, sometimes her stories are totally buried behind all the quotes and ramblings. For me, this book was just 'so-so' and more of a disappointment that a pleasurable read."
5,Great read!,"This is one of those books that you want to read over and over again! I first borrowed it from the library, but now I am going to buy my own copy! A must read!"
2,Better than Ambien,"Okay, I enjoy Christian fiction that's well-written, interesting, and has multidimensional characters. Unfortunately, none of these descriptors apply to this book by Francine Rivers. The characters are mostly just annoying and whiny. I've never seen so much self pity in one book! The writing is mediocre, plot development put me to sleep. The writer just seems to drive home the same ideas, thoughts, events, and beliefs over and over and over again, ad nauseum. I was barely able to finish this book because it was so depressing and repetitious. Good thing it was free, or I'd really be miffed!"
4,A soul-refreshing affirmation of family and love,"Leota's Garden is the perfect story of the transformation of despair and pain into hope and joy, using the symbolism of a rejuvenated garden. A granddaughter seeks out her estranged grandmother and finds an old woman who has little to live for, but the relationship which develops between the two brings new understanding and hope for the whole family."
5,another GREAT book by a gifted christian author,I just love Francine Rivers and her work. This was by far a different type of book but also moved by it just as I have been by all of the others that I read. Please take the time to get past the first part .... it took me a month or so to actually get into the book but once I did I coudn't put it down. Wonderfully touching story about a family and the misunderstandings that can put walls up when open communication is not present. Buy it today and enjoy!
3,fair,"i love francine rivers as an author. however, this book never dealt with a crime that was committed; i thought it should have."
4,Leota's Garden,I received this book timely and the condition of book was as described in narrative at purchase. I ordered other Francine Rivers books on this order and have not had time to read this paticular book.
2,Don't expect long life,This applies to the 160 Gb version which died after warranty on very light use - backed up my hard drive about 5 times. Not reliable for archival storage
3,Vibration Driving me INSANE!,"I've had this for about a year and have been on the phone with HP about a sound that I thought was the components inside the hard drive breaking down. But come to find out the sound is just the drive vibrating with the metal inside my Media center PC. I haven't found a solution to stop the noise, I have to pull it in and out of my PC several times a day to get files. It has become a HUGE drag. But on the other hand, I wouldn't want any other external Hard drive. So I deal with it. I'm about to buy the 750gb one hoping it wont vibrate as much. I'm thinking it has something to do with the wearing of the rubber stoppers on the drive. And this one will be my ""back up back up"" in the closet.For anyone who doesn't have their Data backed up.. DO IT NOW. Hard drive failure will happen to you sometime in your lifetime, it's just a matter of when. This removable Hard drive Idea of HP was ingenious... just wish they had made it out of plastic or something less noisy."
4,HP Personal Media Drive 300GB,"The first drive I received was not recognized by my computer, it was returned and I rec'd a second personal media drive which was easy to install and smoothly backs up my files."
3,Not too sturdy,Disappointed that the base doesn't snap to the risers. It is a little wobbly and a pain to put away since it is in several pieces.
4,Good deal,"Good deal for the price. Others only offered a stepper for the same price or higher. Good for starting a small at-home workout space. I don't quite have the room for a home ""gym"", so this works out well."
4,You get what you pay for.,"The step is a little flimsy, but it gets the job done. The fitness ball is made of sturdy material, but there were no instructions for inflation, we had to ask someone who already had one how to get it inflated. Other than that, no real complaints."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The exercise ball is a good deal, the step it pretty sturdy and the weights are what you would expect.My largest complaint would be the air pump for the ball. It did split open along the seam when I was pumping the ball up for the first time.As far as the video goes, it moves pretty quickly so anyone who is just learning the moves for the step will feel overwhelmed the first few times they try it. I would suggest hunting down beginner videos on the internet and hold off on the DVD until you feel like you are fairly comfortable (and coordinated) using the step."
2,Go for the larger step,"The step is to short for most workouts, the resistance bands and weights were the only good purchase with this. The DVD was very difficult to folllow. The top has no rubber mat which makes it very easy to slip on. I went out and bought the larger step for more money"
5,Sting is inspired!,"This is a great CD, the cut Desert Rose is almost like a victory song for those who live in the midst of the sands of life. I always thought Sting was a thoughtful essayist in his lyrics and his talent has caught my ear eversince his first successful single ""Every Breath You Take"". There's a genius in his music, and in the play of words of his songs. This CD has been a frequent background to some of my own ""workouts"" whether in just walking briskly across a ""field of gold"" or doing a few ""military arts moves"" in the silence of my living room. Desert Rose is just uplifting, and gives a spirit of victory to the mind."
5,"Very cultural, brilliantly written & illustrated!","I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to learn about the Chinese tradition and culture when celebrating the lunar New Year. I especially recommend it to the younger Chinese-American parents who want their children to learn about the value & meaning of celebrating Chinese New Year. Next to our older Chinese parents and grandparents, this book is absolutely wonderful in explaining how Chinese New Year is celebrated!"
4,Brief review (very brief),"Ok, if you like anything DBZ you'll probably enjoy this double feature. Both movies had their own surprises and were enjoyable in their own right."
4,Pretty good Blu-ray movie!!,"pretty good DBZ Blu-Ray movie, considering the dragonball series is like 20+ years old. Cant expect too much out of it, i think Funimation did a pretty good job with this Bojack movie. i would recommend this blu-ray to any DBZ fan!! despite not being a wow amazing blu-ray movie.. but none the less a good blu-ray movie."
5,DBZ Android 13/Bojack Unbound DVD Blue-ray,"i liked the way these movies looked in blue-ray, good quality. i would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to watch DBZ"
1,BUGGY,"I like this program. . . when it doesn't lock up on me. I save often because more times than not it crashes. I know it's the software because I bought this program twice (thinking the first time I got a bad disk) and even installed it on a different computer and had the same exact problems. This program has real potential, but needs a patch or something. Be careful!"
4,Good but not great,"I use this machine for light home office use and its worked well so far. Print quality is good but not great and the speed is OK, but its definitely not fast. Has a small footprint so it doesn't take up much space. Set up was easy and the owners manual is relatively straightforward.Buy a spare cartridge immediately though as it only comes with a 30 page one. It works with my answering machine, which I was concerned about - although it does play the message on my answering machine before receiving the fax so some folks have hung up and tried again thinking it was the wrong number.For the money, its about the best you can do - HP has more advanced (and expensive models - start at around $200) but nothing else on the market that I was able to find had these features at this price (25 page memory, large paper input, phone)."
4,Reliable Machine,"Crisp, clear print-outs. Set up was simple, but my only hesitation is that the film that comes with the machine is only good for about 30 pages. I appreciate Brother being upfront about that in the manual (or other owner's literature), but I wish that the ""starter roll"" of film lasted a bit longer."
3,Poor copy quality but good features for the price,"It was 8'oclock when I arrived home with my new Brother PPF560. At 8:20 I was already thinking about taking it back. Sure it has loads of features, most of which no one will use, and yes it's not very expensive, but the print quality is below par. When printing a full text page there are multiple areas that are somewhat faded and others that seem almost blurry. My last fax machine was a Sharp that cost a little over a 100 bucks when new and while I didn't love that machine, at least it copied fairy quickly and the quality of what it did print was good. I'm disappointed with this machine. Oh brother. - Scott"
3,Broke after 1 1/2 YRS!,"This was a good machine for first 1 1/2 years that I had it. But now the printer head won't perform correctly and a new one costs more than we paid for the whole machine! It's a good value for the price, but don't expect it to last very long."
3,"It's ok but after years with a Canon Multifunction, I must admit I am spoiled.","It has no catcher for the ADF or received faxes. The paper holder for the ADF is scrawney. I was an idiot & did not read really anything. It takes rolls of carbon paper for printing (which I've not had to do - I have another printer) as opposed to an ink cartridge. It does not print a receipt so you have no way of verifying that all your info/pages made it across. I was in a hurry, I needed a fax macieine asap, could not go out to look them over & had little money to spend. Next time, I will buy what I want rather then being forced to accept what's out there due to need. I guess it sends ok - No one's called to say anything's wrong but, if it sends too poorly they wouldn't know where to call. It is super slow and often needs to be ""hand fed"" page by page for larger faxes. I guess if I only had a page or two every now & again, it'd be ok. Not what I will choose in the future tho. Sorry."
3,Poor copy quality but good features for the price,"It was 8'oclock when I arrived home with my new Brother PPF560. At 8:20 I was already thinking about taking it back. Sure it has loads of features, most of which no one will use, and yes it's not very expensive, but the print quality is below par.

My last fax machine was a Sharp...while I didn't love that machine, at least it copied fairy quickly and the quality of what it did print was good. I'm disappointed with this machine. Oh brother. - Scott"
1,Don't waste your time,"Machine was Dead on Arrival. Brother tech support had one remedy, unplug the machine and wait five seconds and try again. Still did not power up from three known working outlets. Return to sender was Brothers reply."
1,Poor quality print and fax copies,"I have rarely been so dissapointed in the quality of copy or fax transmission quality. Some pages are barely legible, even though the original is crisp and clear. While this machine is well designed, it is poorly executed. I am not sure if this is what you can expect for around ($$$), but if that be the case, a more expensive purchase would certainly be worth the money spent."
2,Poor Design,"DO NOT BUY THIS!! I had the unit for about 30 minutes before I had it re-boxed and ready for return. I realize this is an inexpensive model, but is poorly made and feels very cheap. As you might imagine, the copies are fair at best. The most annoying problem is that the originals and copies get mixed together because there is no seperation tray. I made 4 copies and came back to find my originals all mixed in with the copies. Also, any faxes you recive or send get dropped on the floor because there is no tray for the original faxes you send or the faxes you receive."
4,Ideal for Personal Use,"This is a great little machine for personal use. Very user friendly. OK, so the quality of the copies and incoming faxes is fair at best, but they're quite passable and legible, and for personal use, you really don't need any better than that. Besides, I don't make copies or receive faxes all that often, anyway. I primarily use it to send faxes, and it does an excellent job of that.Overall, for the price, I don't think there's a better personal fax machine out there. However, although I didn't find a better price than Amazon's, I didn't get my PPF560 from Amazon. I got mine from Staples.com. Their price was only a few cents different from Amazon's, and they don't charge for shipping on orders over a certain dollar amount."
5,great price for a fax machine that works,This fax machine works great. No jams when sending faxes like my previous Panasonic Fax.
1,Worest ever owned,"never worked smoothly, and it stopped working in less than a year. Don't waste your $$$ on this."
5,Fantastic,This book is fantastic!!!! I love Leslie Nielsen!!!The humor in it is the same of the movies!!!I laughed from the beginning to the end!!!
1,Why Read A Book That's Totally Made Up?,"I thought this would be the interesting story of this great actor's life--but then started reading and was told over and over that it was completely false and made up. So why would I read this book? Nielsen gives details of his background that you have to go to Wikipedia to verify, but it is all done with a large sense of humor. Then almost all the photos in the book are faked shots of Leslie ""appearing"" in movies he wasn't in or winning an Oscar. So it's funny but false. After awhile I had to stop reading because it was frustrating to want to get to know this guy and have the entire thing be a big joke. I'm unsure why anyone would read a book when you know from the start that you can't separate the truth from fiction. I hope some day there will be a real book about this wonderful star."
5,Review on IDRP,"This book was great, I would highly suggest CEO's, CIO's and the rest of the computer industry assign someone from their IT department to read this book and complete the easy to follow templates to be prepared for a disaster in this day and time you just never know when it could happen to your company. No one can predict a disaster with their desktop computers, servers and main frames but if your company is prepared, the down time can be measured in hours or days rather than weeks and months before you are completely operational again and everyone on the IT/Management team will know what their responsibility are during the disaster from power and communication to hardware ordering gathering of backups in off storage to reinstallation and testing. Great ideal Mr. Tempelmeyer and Mr. Olson job/research well done!!"
4,Great,This cable allowed me to move my antenna to an area of the house that allows it to receive the signal that could NOT be received from close to my stereo components. Signal has gone from 0% to 60% whcih is great for casual listening. I would give it 5 stars if I knew that it was not the length of added cable that limits the signal strength to 60%.
5,A Great Find,This book brings together a lot of ideas that are mentioned elsewhere but in one place. It brings together information in a clear and easily read way that all will appreciate. I see it in each person's library who is interested in building wealth and prosperity.
5,A Book For Success,"Excellent book, one of the best and easy reading I ever had. James is one of my most preferred authors. Shows you different and innovative concepts in an easy way. Highly recommended, he will change your mindset, and with that your life approach, and then your success achievment."
4,An insightful read,"This book was a very informative and resourceful book for understanding nature's universal laws and principles, and how they affect you and your life. Learning the science of success is crucial for becoming a more productive, goal setting, high achieving individual. A great additive for your personal development repertoire."
5,Provides the motivation to reach your goals and dreams!,"This book provides inspiration and motivation to anyone that wants to step outside of their comfort zone and try what others deem ""impossible"". Gives the assurance that success is possible if one trusts in their own abilities."
5,Best Book I've Read in a Long Time,"I like the concepts shared in the book so much, I bought several more copies to give to friends. I also bought and read the books of the people that he talked about in his book. It has been a chain reaction of books. I highly recommend reading it."
3,"OK, but not revolutionary...","This book was OK, but contained a lot of material that appeared to be directly drawn from the work of Covey and Robbins. The main points were repeated over and over again to the point of boredom. Probably a very good read to someone who hasn't already read similar works, but less than enlightening for anyone who has."
5,Advice straight to the point,"Very good book. It goes straight to the point of describing the laws and principles governing the Universe and how to use them to create your ideal life.Not too long, very simple to read, clear pointers."
4,nothing new but put together well,I enjoyed the book. No real new material but I did enjoy how it was organized and presented
3,Wow! Marketing success,"Oprah today, huge forum entries in space above reviews. Marketing has successfully leapfrogged this book to the top. Harmonic success in accordance with universal laws applies to more of The Secret and Law of Attraction stuff. If you think it, it will be so. I love being inspired, however, and enjoyed reading another version of the universal law route to success.If you are interested in creating wealth, check out ""The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth,"" by Phillip Collinsworth."
2,Reads like a college term paper,"I saw James Ray live as a guest speaker at a conference I attended. I thought he did a fabulous job. Very entertaining and his message was right on with a lot of entertaining stories.I wish that I could tell you the same thing about his book. I did like that the end of each chapter had a nice summary. Unfortunately most of the text borrows heavily from other success literature. It is a rather dry read with few memorable examples.For someone new to the success area, this does give you a lot of information. However if you've read the popular books that are out there - this will likely serve as a re-hash of their concepts."
1,"""Borrowed"" Principles","If you've read Tony Robbins, you've read James Arthur Ray. And that's NOT a slam on Tony. Mr. Ray, in my opinion ""borrowed"" most of the concepts in this book from other writers, which would have been okay if he'd at least PRESENTED them in an original way. But, though I tried, I couldn't find a single orginal thought here. Thus the one star rating."
1,Come on - This guys a con man!,Get real everybody. This guy is being investigated for murder due to his greed and incompetence in the sweat lodge deaths.
5,the guy in the spotlight review only wishes he wrote college papers like this,"While I have never heard James Arthur Ray in conference, judging from his book, he must be an amazing individual. I found this book very original, and for the critic in the spotlight review to claim that it's simply a ""re-hashing of concepts"" is absurd. To take something that seemed common and to make it new, or to view it in a different way, that is that mark of a great writer. And in my opinion, Ray is certainly a great writer, and this book is most definitely a great book."
1,never received,"I was hoping I could start ordering on line but I have not received one book from my first order with you folks, sender asked to verify address, and it is correct, still nothing. Not a good experience I would love to use your service, but for now I am stuck with ordering items through local book stores and waiting, as you guys cant seem to deliver to meThank you, Jeff Rogers"
4,"Hot, Sexy, Rich","Marissa Monteilh wrote an excllent novel titled ""Hot Boyz"". She took 3 extremly sexy and wealthy black men and wrote about their lives. The women in their lives, the children and their jobs. You saw the love of family in the story. It was an awesome story that encourages you to move on each and every day. It teaches you to let go when somebody doesn't want to be with you. A great story indeed! Check it out!"
3,Hot Boyz? How About Lukewarm Men,"I found this one on the discount shelf of my favorite book store. I was expecting something alot more fiery based on the title. What I got was a long and drawn out story about a family who has to pick up and move on when a tragedy occurs in the home of one of the brothers. I never really got into this story. It certainly wasn't a page turner, but it was well written and the story made sense. I did appreciate the fact that the story explores several relationships (brother to brother, husband and wife, mother to children), although the relationship between Mason and Mercedes did not end as I anticipated. I'd pick this one up from the library."
4,"yeah, it was good","I don't really like the title for this book, but yes, the story did keep me reading well into the night and into the next day."
1,This is not the right cd!!!!,"This is not the correct cd, i was very disappointed. Jon Hendricks has an album called Cloudburst but it's this album http://allmusic.com/album/cloudburst-r140602Amazon needs to notify the vendor. If you want Jon Hendricks do not purchase this cd."
5,Convenient and efficient,"I have loved having these crib sheets! I only have to use one regular sheet, and then this goes over the top. When it needs to be changed, a few snaps does the trick and off it comes. Otherwise I'd have to have a mattress pad, a waterproof pad, and a regular sheet, and all three would have to come off for each change. With the thick mattress on the crib, changing them would be a real chore. The Ultimate Crib Sheet saves time and money."
4,Buy more than one!!,"This is great product that has enabled me to change my son's bedding in about 2 minutes which is a huge help, especially during the middle of the night. No more stripping the entire crib and struggling to pull the crib sheets tightly under the mattress; all you do is snap the elastic ties around the crib slats and you are done! Another plus, stains (even those from pink amoxicillin!) wash out very easily. I would have given this 5 stars but I have had 2 small problems with this item: 1.)The plastic backing on one of the three sheets that I purchased has begun to crack/tear(but it still works) and, 2.) the same sheet did not come with any snaps at the headboard/footboard ends. I think that this may have just been a manufacturer's defect but if you're purchasing this item in the store, you may want to take the sheet out of the bag to check if there is a snap at the top and at the bottom. Other that these 2 minor problems, this is a wonderful product to have."
3,Great idea... just not fabulous for convertable cribs,"The baby isn't here yet. But we've bought a couple of these. I'm a tad hesitant because they don't fit very well on our convertable crib. They do give instuctions, saying to just use a slate next to the thickers corner one(for convertable cribs), but I find it fits very awkwardly. However taking the whole crib apart(with the bumper being a huge deal, also to get on, considering the thick corner posts), it makes me want to cry to think I'd have to do this very often. So, we'll give these a shot. I may end up doing the zip on sheet set, which would work with any crib, and seems like a dream. I've also heard great things about those. I just didn't want to invest in that, if I could get away with these. Will let you all know, if these turn out to be a disaster."
3,Eh.,"It works well enough, but it takes so long to get all 10 of those snaps around the crib rails, ya might as well just change the regular sheet."
5,A must-have,"Anyone who hates fighting with the crib bumper and hefting up the heavy mattress to change sheets and mattress covers in the middle of the night will LOVE these! I started using them with my second child and now that I'm expecting number 3 I've bought more. No complaints whatsoever - just an easy, convenient and quick way to keep baby's crib clean and fresh (even at 2 a.m.!)- Mom of three (to be)"
2,Started falling apart even before baby arrived,"I registered for, and received two of these crib sheets...they were highly recommended by friends who had babies. I recently washed them in preparation of our son's arrival and to my horror, after a single wash, they are already coming apart. The plastic side has many small tears, which will only get worse with wear and additional washings. I followed the washing instructions exactly, used Dreft and dried on low heat just until the sheet was no longer damp. I'm pretty dissapointed and afraid to see how long they last."
4,defintly would recommend if you like to save time!,"This is a great product! My friend recommended it to me and when I saw it, I did not want to cover my pretty sheets with this. So it sat in the closet. Well, after a few times of bed wetting and spitting up, I knew I was not going to go through the trouble of removing the bumper and actual matress to wash the sheets and the again to put them back on. So I tried out the ultomate crib sheet, and I love it. No, it is not as pretty as your bedding sheet set, but who cares! If it means more time with my daughter and less time doing laundry, I'll take it. When I washed it, it did shrink a bit and one of the elastic straps did fall off, but I just sewed it back on. This is a great time saver, that all mommies should have!"
2,dangerous?,at the head and foot of the sheet there are snaps that can come completely off.one elastic strap end snaps to the sheet then wraps around the crib rail and snaps back onto the sheet. if you undo both snaps you are left with a loose elastic band. baby could choke on it if you ask me. i liked the product for its ease of use.. but once i noticed the straps could snap completely off.. i stopped using it.
1,Too small,"I bought two of these thinking that it was going to be as wonderful as the reviews made it out to be. Unfortunately it didn't fit my standard sized mattress. It was about 1-2 inches too short. Since I assumed that it would fit properly, I threw away the packaging. That was a big mistake. If you buy this product make sure to keep the packaging for a while...if it doesn't fit you can return it."
2,Not as great as I thought it would be,"I bought this for son's crib. I am the type of person who likes to wash the crib linens a lot. I thought this would save me the aggrivation of having to struggle with the fitted sheet everytime. I have to say that the idea is good, but I personally do not think that it fits tightly enough for a crib to be safe. If you have an older baby perhaps it is a different story. My son is now 17 months old and he can figure out how to unsnap the sheet, as I am sure many other children can do as well. In my opinion, the best and safest way to make the bed is with the fitted sheet and a waterproof pad under it between the mattress cover and the fitted sheet!"
2,Too hard to remove,I bought this crib sheet thinking it would simplify my life. But it didn't. I had the hardest time attaching and detaching this from the crib. I just use it without attaching it. I also have a mattress cover that is fitted I leave on under the sheets. I also have a Carter's matress pad I leave on top over the sheet so I can just remove that. Would be so much better if it was velcro!
3,"Not a perfect fit for more robust, convertible cribs","I really do like the idea of this crib sheet. The only problem is that I have a very thick convertible crib (crib, toddler, full bed) and the corners are too big for the staps to secure to the snap. For now the sheet is secured to the slat beside the corner leaving about an inch of space not covered by the sheet...no biggy, worth it for the convenience. I plan to eventually replace the elastic closures with longer elastic pieces for a perfect fit."
4,Negatives and Positives....,"I agree with the other mom's this item is so wonderful and very easy to use..But I have to also agree that they are somewhat disposable,when you wash them the snaps fall off.....This is a lot cheaper than what I paid for them, I bought mine at babies r us and spent 20 a piece on them...."
5,So easy!,"I thought this looked wonderful in the store so I registered for a couple. Afterwards I attempted to put a cute sheet and mattress pad in the crib... such a chore! I started using these and haven't had to change the cute sheet since. It's so easy to just snap on and not fuss with anything else. It's a soft sheet on top, an absorbent layer in the middle, and a waterproof vinyl back so nothing leaks through. I've changed it in the middle of the night in a couple minutes tops... it washes up great with my baby's normal laundry too! I highly recommend these sheets."
2,takes just as long,"This is supposed to save time instead of changing out the sheet, but I found it took just as long to change this as it does to change the actual sheet. You have to reach all around the crib to do (or undo) all the snaps, which is aggravating and somewhat difficult depending on the placement of your crib. Compared to just lifting up the mattress and quickly pulling off the sheet and putting a new one on, I think this might actually take longer."
1,Thought they were great.....,"I have these and I thought that they were wonderful. But I just read on another website that a mother of an older infant found her baby stuck under one and I see there is a new post regarding the same thing here. Based on this, I will be removing these from my daughters crib this evening. If it can happen with one child, it can happen w/ any and it is better to be safe than sorry."
4,A good product.,"Overall, I would recommend this sheet. It is easy to remove and change and hassle free. I have several and have only had one where the snaps came off in the washing machine. I recommend laundering with a laundry bag."
2,Not worth the money,"I thought this seemed like a wonderful product but it's not practical if you have a crib that's not exactly like the standard prison bar type crib. Ours has a large panel on the back which makes it impossible to secure the back snap. Also, the snaps have become loose and can come undone very easily. My daughter is only 4 months old and she has started pulling on the sheet at night and it has come undone posing a serious suffocation risk. I am removing this sheet to never use again. It really is not that hard to change a normal sheet."
5,Cool product for a busy mom,"I am impressed with this sheet! The top layer is very soft, there is no way any fluid will pass through the bottom layer, and the whole thing is so easy to change despite crib bumpers. I remember one smart mommy saying she was able to leave her pretty, decorative sheet on underneath (which is viewable from outside the crib) while having an easy to change top sheet to spare the ""pretty sheet"". Only prob I have is one side of my convertible crib has extra wide slats, and the elastic bands won't fit around one. But, since all but one secured the sheet, I am not worried about it."
4,Great timesaver,"My sister told me that I needed to put the ulimate crib sheet on my registry. She said it is a lifesaver in the middle of the night. She was right!! I would definitely get two though. One downside to the U.C.S. is that I found after several washings, the snaps are starting to come off in the wash. But I guess that is why you should get two. But otherwise, I would recommend this to anyone who has a crib in the house."
4,Ultimate Crib Sheet,Great product. makes changing the sheets on a crib much easier. Only complaint is the plastic snaps.
2,"Great product, but not very durable","My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months, so this product was wonderful. However, by the time that he was 6 months old, all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs. The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones (maybe a different brand) for future children, but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these."
3,Not a great quality.,"This has been a fair crib sheet so far. I gave it only 3 stars since the quality of the fabric is not that good. After a few washes it starts losing its softness (even with the use of fabric softeners), also the washes cause it to make the snap fasteners get lose, therefore they start falling and getting lost. I have two that broke and got lost and now to still make use of the sheet I have to tie those up to the corners of the crib. It becomes a pain and now I think I either look for a better one or try to fix this one by replacing all those plastic snap fasteners.It works really good on being easily placed and removed, it does the job on that, no doubt about it, but if you are looking for something that can last longer with a better quality, then I would keep looking before making up your mind on this one.Note: Seller got late on the delivery since it was out of stock. However, good service on letting me know about this and being fast on their restocking."
4,convenient,"I love these....I just wish that the elastic bands in the corners fit a larger piece of the crib. Otherwise, this makes life easier. And that is always good."
1,Hazardous--Return immediately,"I bought this, put it on the crib, took one look at it, took it off, and returned it. I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it--it bunched and wouldn't lay flat. Also the snaps didn't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure. This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment. My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I don't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway."
5,"Great purchase, you'll love it.","What I liked most about this crib sheet is that its made of a type of plastic on top, which is great for those accidents. I'd rather it stay on top of the bed than have it soak all the way through to the mattress which causes more of a mess to clean up. I found it to be such a great product, that I recommend it to my friends who are pregnant and my sister in law etc."
2,Found something better,"Tried the Ultimate crib sheet, but had difficulty getting to the back of the crib (no wheels), and felt it was a pain to snap / unsnap that many places. After a little research, found the quick zip crib sheet by clouds and stars. Have had for 3 months now and love them!!! So easy to change - only advice is to put a flat waterproof pad underneath so you can just lift both off to launder."
1,Useless for me,"I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth. Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort: it's made of lightweight foam. As a result, changing her sheets is also super easy. I just have to lift the mattress, and it takes two seconds. On the other hand, snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus, the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash, which means snap on crib, unsnap, snap again before wash, unsnap, snap on crib...) So, if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room, I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners. If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room, then by all means, try the ultimate crib sheet..."
4,Corner snap ties could be longer,Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer. We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner. The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners. No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side. So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn't appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue. If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn't seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions. We'll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs.
5,Wonderful time saver,"I love this sheet. I just need to unsnap the sheet from the crib to wash. If I wanted to change a regular sheet, I would have to move the crib away from the wall and remove the bumper pad. I made up the crib with the ""cute"" sheet, all washed and ready for use, then snapped this one on top. Now in the middle of the night, I can just remove a soiled top sheet and put my son back in bed in minutes. No hunting for a clean sheet, or removing hard to get at sheet from the crib."
1,A great idea gone awry...,"When I bought these two years ago for my daughter, they were the best sheets! Thickly padded and washed and dried like a dream. I still have them and use then regularly. THEN, when my son came along this year, I got two more. WHAT JUNK! They are now less than half as thick and after only one washing the vinyl backing is all wrinkled. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, they won't last a month of washing."
3,Wonderful for the first few months,"Nothing beats the convenience of these sheets-they are so easy to change even with bumpers in the crib. However, I had two and they both shrunk after about 4 months of use, even though I washed them according to the instructions. Now I am too afraid to use them because they don't meet the ends of the crib. They are too expensive to be able to only use for a few months."
1,Past Its Prime,"Washed as instructed and it shrunk after two washings. The sheet doesn't lay flat, the backing is wrinkled and the edges turn up. Parents who bought their sheets years ago seem to have had better results. I suspect cost cutting has made the product worse for wear. Definitely not worth the expense."
2,The snaps come off,"This sheet is great in concept and is convenient to use, but on both of the ones I purchased, the snaps to hold it on came off in the washer -- a front loading washer that is more gentle to clothes than a wringer washer at that. I contacted the manufacturer by email and US mail to request replacements several months ago and got no response. Based upon this experience, I would not recommend this product."
1,PVC?!,"Was really, really excited to get these, then read what it is made out of, the very bottom layer is PVC. Now why would I want my newborn daughter to sleep on this and breathe it in? Not in a lifetime. Plus, when I opened the package, it smelled of plastic. I will do the laundry when she messes up the bed and deal with it rather risk exposure to PVC fumes."
3,Great if you have no dust ruffle...,"We were so excited about this product and we got 2 crib sheets, only to find out that since we have a dust ruffle around the crib that we can't use it since it has to snap into the frame of the crib. We are using them as waterproof mattress pads and love them, but it would have been nice to know that ahead of time."
4,Good for the first year or so..............,"These are good sheets, and so easy to change! However, my son (15 months)learned how to unsnap them, so we're going to have to switch to traditional ones."
4,easy to change,"I haven't actually used this particular brand, but for those of you have not yet had a baby and tried to change the crib sheets this type of product is a must!!! It is easily removed and changed without having to remove the bumper pads (and practically the mattress) to get the little sheet off. You will probably never have to accomplish this Herculean task if you have a couple of these in the drawer. This has become my favorite shower gift for first time mothers."
1,Not worth it!,We got 2 of these sheets as a gift and I feel sorry for the person who bought them. They don't stand up to any kind of washing and they're still dangerous. My wife and I finally gave up and made our own sheets that are much much safer. They're like larger pillow cases that fit over the entire mattress. Little more trouble to put on but our son can't get wrapped up in them no matter what.
3,"High utility, low quality","The concept of this sheet is great, however the quality and fit is not. It contained messes and saved me the trouble of changing the crib sheet every so often. It lost its fit after just one wash and started to pill after a couple. Also couple of snaps broke off in the washing machine :( Not sure if i'll buy it again even though the price has gone down considerably ( got it for $18 6 months back)."
5,Love it!,"I bought one to try it out since it was recommended in ""Baby Bargains."" I loved it so much that I bought 2 more for myself, then a few as presents for others. If you have to change your cribs sheets often because your baby spits up a lot- this is a great product to have. It absorbs like nothing else and changes easily. Try it, you will love it too."
3,Doesn't work on all cribs,"I will say this would be a great product, assuming you have a crib that can use it. If you have a crib that has slatted sides all the way around, this is probably a product you will love. However, after getting all excited about this crib sheet, I was very disappointed to find it just won't work with our crib because the back side is solid wood (it is not slatted), so there is nowhere to attach the sheet/snaps on the entire back edge--which is no good b/c that increases the chances of smothering. Too bad..."
5,A DEFINITE must have,"Can't imagine life without this! It's my favorite thing besides his favorite blankie. I got two Ultimate Crib Sheets when my son was born. He's now 18 mths and they are still going strong, although they have started showing some wear underneath. Mine are a bit short on the ends, but it doesn't bother me or him. I recently changed the sheet on his bed, but don't think I've done so for about six months. It doesn't really get dirty unless you have some serious overnight leaking, which we recently have had (obviously time to size up his diapers). Changing the sheet means taking the bumper most of the way off and the mattress out of the crib. I certainly don't have time for that on a weekly basis and you won't either. Make sure and get a couple!!!"
4,A Must-Have,"I registered for two of these sheets before my son was born and glad I did! We just moved him into his new crib (a Sorelle, an Italian-import) with a cute Winnie-the-Pooh bedding ensemble. He's a side sleeper, so diaper leakage can be a problem. The Ultimate Crib Sheet saves a lot of time, money, and effort: (1) it takes little time to change ultimate crib sheets, (2) you don't have to buy multiple crib sheets (we still have the one), and (3) it's easy to snap on and off. I would get at least two: one to throw in the wash when it gets soiled/wet and another to change with. And it really is ""4 Products In One! Quick Change Sheet, Mattress Pad, Super Absorbent Pad, Waterproof Pad."""
5,The Ultimate Gift for Baby and Mom,The Ultimate Crib Sheet is the ultimate gift for both baby and mom. No more wrestling with a fitted crib sheet. Just lay the Ultimate Crib Sheet over the pretty fitted sheet that matches the bedding and snap it in place. In less than a minute a new sheet is in place and the crib didn't have to be moved and mom didn't get frustrated trying to keep the sheet around the matress while the bumper pads kept pushing it off. It's perfect for those middle-of-the-night sheet changes and it can even be put on one-handed. A must for all moms!
3,Beware of the dryer...,"This sheet came highly recommended. I followed the manufacturers directions on washing/drying but the backing still cracked on the first washing. My advise, it sounds like a great idea but hang it to dry."
2,not for every crib :o(,"I had really been looking forward to receiving these at my baby shower but ended up being extremely disappointed with them. They DO NOT work in all cribs! If you have a crib with slats on all four sides, buy them up, I'm sure they'll work great for you. If you have a crib like mine, however, that has a solid back, don't waste your time. The corner straps are too far up along the sides to secure the sheet to the end slats of the crib and the center strap is too short to stretch to the mattress support underneath. A major disappointment!"
2,"Great concept, but doesn't fit ALL cribs","This would not work with our crib that has a solid headboard. It only attaches on 3 sides of the crib, leaving an opening for baby to get caught up in on the back. We did not use the sheet for this reason."
4,I love these sheets!,"They are awesome! I love that they are so easy to clean, especially once I realized that it is an absolute nightmare to change my regular crib sheet. As a first time mother, who knew? My only concern is that the top seems almost too soft. Now that Sammy is starting to sleep on his tummy, that might be a concern."
1,Not worth the money spent!,I was so excited to receive my Ultimate Crib Sheet. I thought this would be the answer! Before I used the sheet for the first time I washed it according to directions. When I went to put the sheet on the crib it would not fit. No matter what I tried to do the crib sheet would not snap all the way around the crib. A couple of the snaps are very loose and won't stay snapped. My crib has the wide slats on it and maybe that's why it won't fit. I was so frustrated! Now I have this sheet that I can't even use.
1,"I tried, but it failed","Despite some poor reviews, I decided to try this item because it sounded like such a great idea for leaky diapers. However, one of the snaps wouldn't work after the first wash. Also, the white elastic bands which snap around the crib looked terrible against my cherry wood crib. Finally, I found almost no leaking with Huggies Ultra Trim diapers (Huggies Newborn diapers leaked a lot)."
2,Not Soft,"Seemed like a good idea, but I didn't care for it. I returned it because it wasn't soft. Actual crib sheets are much nicer to look at too."
3,not as easy as it appears,"I thought this would save my issues of having to change the cribsheet all the time, but I actually think all the snaps are harder than changing a crib sheet. If you use a bumper, like I do, then it is not the best solution b/c I like to tuck my bumper in and you can't tuck it in if you use these crib sheet savers b/c the snaps go onto the rails and prevent the bumper from being able to be pulled down. I think if you have a 'puker' or someone who constantly wets the bed and you don't have a bumper it might be a good solution, but there are a lot of snaps every time you put it on and take it off."
4,Great Use,"When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy. Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it. Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily. I don't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib. This makes life simple and cleaner. You can use it anywhere."
5,Could not live without this!,"These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib. I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress, and I've never taken it off. I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets. I have three; I would recommend that number. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets...this is just SO EASY snap, snap, snap and you're done!I never dry mine in the dryer. I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours. I want mine to last, and using the dryer tends to wear them out. I've never not had one on hand, with 3 total."
2,"Would work, but ...","Wanted something that would be quick to take off (top layer) in the middle of the night & have a dry sheet underneath, so ordered 2, thinking we'd layer them. If they were fitted crib sheets (which I thought they were), they'd be perfect - but instead they have these little snaps in 6 places meant to fit onto bars of crib - ?! Therefore, they wouldn't be easy to change out in the middle of the night (and, less importantly, they won't fit with cute fitted sheets on top, nor would they work with a crib tent). So I'm returning them. A plastic fitted sheet is what we need, but these won't work."
2,Save your money,I received this as a baby gift. My daughter is four months old and we still haven't needed to use it. And we've only had to change her bedsheets twice! She doesn't mess them up at all. Wish we'd taken it back for something more useful.
1,Not worth it,"This is a book of auditing case studies without solutions to the cases, for someone purchasing the text for their own use it was impossible to get the solutions from the publisher they refused my request. Do not purchase this text if you are using it for self study."
2,not worth is,"I bought this item and went by the image, which says 12 pack on the image and pack of 24 in the writing. This is not the case, as most of their other items say, the image shows how many in the box and the writing shows how many boxes there are. Well, there is 24 boxes but only 4 soups in each, not 12. I called customer services who said you are right, it does say that but its not there fault, they only know what the company tells them and its been 3weeks and the same image is still up for customers. I bought other items through the new grocery, and most images show the number of items in the box and the wording shows how many boxes, so don't buy this item thinking your getting 12 in each because customer service will make you feel like its your fault and have no consideration for their false advertising. if this isnt bad enough, the soups are small with almost nothing in them for a cup a soup. Just be cautious with what you buy here, if they dont know whats in them either."
4,Nice mouthpiece,"It's a Bobby Shew. My wife says it is very nice, and the a good deal for the price. Recommended."
2,omg don't do this at home,"This stuff hurts SO bad!Before I tried, I read and saw many, many videos. I followed every step.Bottom line: IT HURTS LIKE HELL!I don't see why people even get this done professionally when shaving is 100% pain-free.I am returning as soon as UPS picks up the package!"
4,Works for this guy,"As a guy, just couldn't afford to pay $90+ for Brazilian wax charged here. Used baby powder instead of oil and worked really well. Boiled water in a ceramic bowl then set the melted wax container in that bowl to keep temp warm. Worked well. Only had to reheat once. Instead of trying to pull strip in one pull by myself (which I was having difficulty with, I took thumb or finger and once had a corner of the wax rolled up, flicked it little by little with the finger/thumb and that worked well with seemingly less pain."
3,too much pain but effective,it was good but hurt verrrrry much lol i was super excited to use it but would reccommend it if you can handle tthe pain
1,Didn't work and it stunk,"Horrible barely took of any hair , stunk really bad and some of the bottles were open when I received this, I have been waxing since i was 13 I'm 32 now and this is the worst wax ever in all my years .but I returned and the seller gave my money back with no hesitation that's the only good this don't buy this , the veet wax strips are better than this"
4,GREAT WITH PRACTICE,"First off for the price you are definitely getting what you pay for! The product is easy to use, can be a little messy takes some getting used to then again this product is muslin strip- free, all you have to do is zap it apply it and let it cool. I would not suggest however, that you do not use this product for a complete brazilian wax, really! Once dry, yanking it away on a sensitive part just does not sit well, for bikini and armpits however it is perfect but to become a bald eagle, to the strips. With that being said if you want to wax your own armpits, this doubles as a great kit."
1,Does not work!!,"I have been waxing various parts of myself for 10 years, and this is the worst wax ever! I tried w/ the pre wash and oil, w/o the oil and just the pre wash, and w/o either and just soap and i literally counted the hairs it actually pulled out, under 10. I even stood in front of the AC unit to dry my skin out, and then applied and stood in front of it again to cool the wax, and it did nothing. Im going on vacation tomorrow and its too late to do anything other than shave. Im furious. THIS PRODUCT IS AWFUL!!!"
5,Easy home wax,"can wax myself everywhere, but never attempted a brazilian wax. There was no way i was gonna get stuck with wax there if i couldn't remove it. But i took the plunge after reading a few reviews. Easy. Peasy. Someone recommended I use strips with it even though it's a stripless wax, great advice. So easy. I think it gets even more than 95% of the hair. And much less painless I found than even expensive salons I've been too. Great product. But you gotta have a lotta guts to attempt it. If that's you, then you can do it. Make sure you apply the pre-oil. It seems like it would be good for 2 uses. So a little over $10 a wax is a great price. Well, even less, b/c after 2 uses with this, you'll have enough of the prep/post creams for probably 2 more waxes with just buying the wax and not the kit."
5,no hair virtually pain free,"I have used other waxes and I have had a professional wax, all were painful. Gigi Brazilian hard wax is a great wax that removes the hair virtually pain free. It pulls the hair out clean and doesn't impact the skin. Thanks to this product I no longer have to shave daily and I will have great looking hairless, smooth skin (with no visible hair roots lingering just beneath the skin's surface)."
4,Ouch!,"Okay, this hurts. Really badly if you're using it on your bikini area. On the legs and underarms it's totally gentle. Drawback, it's messy and the wax off cream doesn't really take it off, you still have to scratch relentlessly at your skin to get up any pieces that were too thin to pull off. It does a great job pulling out the hair though. It only left behind my baby blonde hairs, which every wax I've ever used does."
2,Too messy and too expensive!,"This was very messy, very painful, and impossible to clean up afterwards. It heated very quickly to a very thin consistency so when you use the spatula to go from the container to the bikini area it was sure to drip.I hear their other products are ok. But I won't be trying. For the cost it should be spectacular.I threw it in the trash."
1,Use Caution,"I would just say be careful with this product. It says to not microwave over one minute, but at one minute it was still too hard to use so I put in for 15 more seconds. When I took it out the top was so hard that when I broke through it, the hot wax underneath it exploded on me and burned my hand and face. Maybe my microwave is just funky, but definitely be careful with this stuff. I've been trying to pick wax out of my hair all morning."
5,I love GIGI!,This product is freaking great--I love their hard wax and all of the cremes they give on the side are excellent and work really well!
1,Never again...,"I usually get waxes done at a shop but I attempted at the suggestion of a friend to try this product. It is packaged very nicely all the products are clearly labeled, the smell is nice BUT this hurt like the dickens!! There is a handle on the kit I bought for when it comes out of the microwave which I founf very helpful, unfortunately timing hot/too hot time frame can depend on if this will work for you. I had to microwave it twice and just deal with the heat. It does create a little bit of a mess unless you have great aim and a great deal of patience. If you are a professional this is a great product to use,but as a novice I'll stick to the shop."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Wow. I don't know where to begin. I bought this product because the reviews looked great. Um no. The wax did NOT take my hair off, but it hurt as much as if it was ripping my hair off! It hurt so bad I was shaking. Please don't buy this product. I've never been in so much pain in my life! And it didn't even work so the pain was for nothing. I am extremely disappointed."
2,Good product but use caution,"I am conflicted about this product. The first time I used it, like a lot of the 1-star reviewers, the wax was still hard on top and when I went to carefully stir it, the super heated wax in the middle squirted up and hit my chest. I had second degree burns on my chest, and now have permanent scars that I'm still dealing with.As part of my own cathartic healing process, I faced down this wax once again, this time with much more caution. And to be honest, as a hair down there remover, it really works great. The results are sometimes, dare I say, better than a salon.Please please PLEASE be careful when using this product. As someone who is generally very careful with this kind of stuff, I am slightly shocked at how easy it was for me (and now I know, other people too) to have gotten burned with this wax. With that said, I'll admit it is a great wax for a DIY brazilian."
2,not pleased,"first of all, i dont reccomend someone waxing themself. its 10x harder then you would think. seconly. the wax took way too long to melt and dryed out way too fast. for the second use the wax looked weird because it was used previously. I say if u want to get a bikini wax, splirg a bit and get it done at the salon."
3,It can work...,"Through trial and error, this product CAN work pretty well, with the following observations:1. Do strip by strip, not an entire area at a time.2. Test wax on back of hand to be sure it's not too hot (assuming you can tell with your eyes that it's not liquid lava).3. Don't use the oil provided.4. Needs 2 people! One to pull off wax (quickly!), and one to pull skin TIGHT!5. Expect some straggler hairs, to be tweezed.6. A wooden chopstick works well to stir wax with as you're in process of heating it.7. Do not expect this to be fast, easy, or glamorous. : )With all that said, it's a pain, but it's cheaper than a salon, it CAN work pretty well, and for me at least, it's way more tolerable to have a husband or friend cause tears to spring from your eyes than a stranger."
2,Wasn't For Me,"My microwave couldn't get it warm enough so by the time it was ""warm"" I had to wait a bit for it to cool down so it wouldn't burn my skin. It was messier then I thought it would be and I decided it was just too painful to put up with. However, if you have a good microwave and can stand the pain of pulling it off, it works pretty dang good."
5,A Truly Amazing Story That Keeps You Moving,"On the promise that he won't see combat, John Lefter enlists for a 3 year hitch in the Army Security Agency. I guess, since we are talking about the Army, you know what happens. He ends up in Korea. It doesn't take long until Lefter is in a bunker real close to the front lines. A lot of things happen then and most of them were not good.Once I started Stay Safe Buddy, I had trouble putting it down. I went everywhere with Lefter. I shared a lot of his pain and hangovers. I even shared his hatred for Major Soss. This is a great tale of the way things were during the Korean conflict, or war or whatever you want to call it. Just read it!Recommendation: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDTim Hancock is the Director of MWLA, a Reviewer and Author"
4,Mr. Smitten the line of least resistance in on the Pivot,NOT ON THE TREND LINE. I DID learn something of value to me in one chapter in your own words. Because of this I am very grad I bought your book.
1,Not worth the paper it's written on.,"This book goes beyond fiction, it's pure fantasy. If you like fiction, there are many other authors who do a much better job. Just make up your own fantasy about Livermore and save yourself the cost of the book. I hope to find a good use for it before I die, but I'm not optimistic. This book will in no way help you in your trading endeavors. Honestly, look someplace else...or donate the money you would spend on this book to charity."
4,Philosophy for non-philosophers,"Thoughtful reading for sci-fi fans. As a pick and choose Star Trek spectator, (I prefer TNG) I found it a great oops-it's-one-thirty-in-the-morning read. It may be a bit deep for some, and downright offensive to the religious intolerant and those who worship Roddenberry and his philosophies, but a view I've never seen before of the Trek Universe."
5,Enlightening,"I loved this book all the way through. Hertenstein brought up a lot of questions in this book, and when he answered them, he answered them from a Christian point of view. I, too, am a Christian, though my views differ a good deal from those of Mister Hertenstein. Nonetheless, I didn't think his views were at all pushy or preachy as some writers can get. Rather, he offered his view and left the reader to discern his own. And I came away from the book with more than a few insights---not from any conclusions he'd drawn, but rather from the questions brought up. I do so enjoy the Trek books focusing on science, especially the works of Mr. Krauss, but it's also nice to have one from a religious point of view. I do not think the two are mutually exclusive. In any case, don't pick up this book expecting to agree with everything (or even most of) what the author writes, but be prepared to have your mind opened by the material. It is a thinking person's book."
2,"HOLY YIKES, CAPTAIN!",Mike Hertenstein is the KING OF NEGATIVITY! If one were to tell him that the glass was half empty-he would loudly declare that the glass was COMPLETLY EMPTY! Does every corner have to be dark? Does everything have to make perfect sense. Its a series. Its entertainment. Its not real life. Calm down.
5,Travel adapter,"Thank you for your prompt service. The first adapter didn't work very well. Yet, without any hassle, you quickly corrected the problem. Thank you. While I did have a small problem, I know you did not make the part. As a business, you dealt quickly and fairly. Thus the 5 star rating."
5,As great as can be!,"Dear John Hasse:Thank you for writing such a meaningful and totally charming book. It should berequired reading for every parent in the world! Your lyrical writing makes childrenfeel so safe and secure....and LOVED.Sincerely,Fran Morris Rosman"
5,I Love You When,I have adopted two children and when adults betray a child it's hard for them to trust. This book helps teaches them that love is unconditional. This book helps them to trust again. They will be loved unconditionaly. This book helped so much with the bounding process. I want to thank John Edward Hasse and Lilian Obligado for creating such a wounderful book.
5,so sweet,"I love to read this book to my kids. It is short, sweet and just wonderful. It has a great message. I always give it in baby shower gifts."
5,"An adorable, charming book!!!","Just purchased this for Valentine's Day for my almost 3 year old and was delighted. The illustrations are so beautiful in how they capture the emotions in the animals and the interaction between the parent and child. My daughter was enthralled by the artwork. Every parent can relate to the images and moments depicted, both challenging and wonderful. The concept of unconditional love is simply, but endearingly communicated in this book. A must have !!!"
5,Now That's Country,Darryl Worley has an incredible voice and is a great songwriter. This song is the first of many great songs by this very talanted man. His music is what country music is supposed to sound like. This song is from his heart and will touch yours.
4,GREAT FINANCIAL ORGANIZER!,"This is a great product! I bought three and gave them out as gifts. You can start using your Billminder anytime of the year. I bought the lastest edition, a real improvement over the original. Billminder has helped me eliminate late fees and made the chore of paying bills more tolerable. You can't go wrong with Billminder, it has a 30 day money back return policy. This is my third year using Billminder and it works!!!!"
5,Tales of Dorsetville continue,"I just LOVE the characters in this series and Katherine Valentine's newest installment does not disappoint. Just a few pages into the first chapter, and I'm transported back to this wonderful New England town filled with funny and heartwarming characters. I feel like I never left.On A Wing and A Prayer begins when the Gallagher twins fall through the ice while playing hockey. Rodney is saved, but by the time the rescue team arrives to save Dudley, his prognosis is bleak. Making matters worse, Doc Hammon must entrust his patient to a stranger in order to undergo heart surgury. As always, the people in Dorsetville rally round, stocking the Gallagher's freezer to overflowing with food, and round the clock prayers. The ending was quite a surprise and one I thoroughly enjoyed."
3,Packard Bell computer does not utilize it correctly,"My Legend Supreme 1910 from Packard Bell NEC only recognizes 32 megabytes rather than the full 128mb.My computer seems to use the Intel 430VX chipset that this DIMM is designed for.According to Packard Bell you need to install two special 64mb DIMMs to get 128 meg.I'm not even sure yet that the 32 megs that my computer does recognize are being used. If so, then this DIMM might have been worth the price. An actual 32mb DIMM costs more than the 128mb DIMM so even if only 32 out of 128 work, I'm okay."
4,Good general repair manual,Like any Hanes or chilton book several repairs are not cover but they were not meant to replace an OEM repair manual. This book covers the most common repairs and if you use it with internet research it will serve you well. I also enjoy having written info avalible when working in the garage.
5,Slow and Beautiful Indie Pop Deserves Bigger Following,"Arco is a trio from London writing sad, melancholy songs that are compared to Nick Drake and Belle & Sebastian. Believe it or not, their songs are slightly wispier and slower. One thing for sure, their songs are consistently beautiful and melodic. If you're looking for powerful, riveting emotional rock, don't look here. If you're looking for sleepy music, along the lines of the Red House Painters, then you've found the right band. If you like this aching folk music, you might want to check out some of the slow songs of Camera Obscura and Cherry Orchard and all of the songs by the equally folksy Flower Machine."
2,Is there a Fish in this text?,"I am amused to read reviews of this book which praise Fish's brilliance, sensitivity, nuanced critical abilities, etc., given that Fish does not believe in authorial intention and thinks the meaning of the text is co-created by the reader. Perhaps, though, these reviewers are praising their own genius, brilliance, etc. Or that is my reading of their texts ..."
3,The book is only in fair condition.,"The price was great and delivery was fast enough, but the cover is bent and badly marked up, and there are handwritten notations in the text,"
5,~Off the Hook~ entire album,"This CD is absolutely elite. Only Tech N9ne, Young Droop, Misphit, Sandman and Twista can be compared to the light speed delivery that this artist brings to the rap scene. Highly recommend this album.. Blows away any, and I mean any mainstream rapper."
5,Great all-around receiver!,"This recent model from Garmin is probably their best all-around performer. It's identical to their most popular model, the III+, but its housed in a sturdier case and has an internal antenna--perfect for outdoor use! For some reason, it has yet to catch the publics fancy (probably the case---its the same case from their lower cost, bare bones receivers), but with the current $50 rebate (good thru March 2000)it should see more sales. The only down side is the amount of maps you can upload is limited. I live in the Phoenix area, and all I can get in is the metropolita area. Other than that, this is the perfect all-around handheld receiver!"
1,Here's a book that lack insight,"If we were not to educate or cause attendion to the Holocaust, it would already have been forgotten and repeated again. This book only prove the myth of an author's begotten desire to fund his own interest. Most childern will never now the story of Uncle Remus but lets all hope they remember at least who Ann Frank was!"
4,The North Bank Road,"Until the Burlington Northern merger in 1971, the Northwest's Own Railway served the route Spokane-Tri Cities-Portland. This story of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle is filled with trivia only a true rail buff could love. It also has some excellent -- and rare -- photos of construction and operations. The unique relationship among the 'Hill Roads' (parents Northern Pacific and Great Northern and offspring SP&S) is explored in detail and with unusual frankness and clarity.The tracks are gone now between Spokane and Tri-Cities, but the SP&S route on the north bank of the Columbia is still the mainline for BNSF and AMTRAK between Portland-Vancouver and Tri-Cities.Recently learning that Volume II to this work is available, I can't wait to read it. This volume will cover the subsidiaries and affiliates of SP&S;, including Oregon Electric, Oregon Trunk, United Railways of Oregon and others."
1,A disappointment,"I loved ""Undressed"" and had high hopes for this one. I felt let down at the end, like I'd wasted my time reading it. Would not recommend it for those looking for something a little more creative."
5,Sensational picking,"Well exceeded my expectations, this is wonderful music performed with exceptional skill.Great for long distance driving.Wish there was more from these two chaps together."
5,Healthy Joint Doggie Treats,My Golden LOVES these! Although they are (my opinion) a little pricey I believe them to be a good investment. They are a hard biscuit so they help with keep his teeth clean and also they have glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in them which is good for his joints. I can't find them anywhere locally so I have to order online. I haven't found a lot of difference in the actual cost of the product but I've found Amazon gives me the best rate on the shipping and overall is the best deal.
3,"good progam, not millennium compatible","This is a program that has some truly fine features, however, it should be noted that this is not a windows millennium compatible program. The plug-ins will not function properly under millennium, so there is really no way that I can give this product an endorsement, as there are large parts of it that will not function on my system. It does however, seem to have some good functions. Unfortunately, there is no patch out that I know of to solve the millennium problem, so if you're running it, avoid this program."
1,Product unsuitable for older handicapped children,The wrist tags which are an essential component are only designed to fit a young child (perhaps up to 10-12?) and will not fit on the wrist of an older handicapped child. The product description makes no mention of this limitation.
1,Not as advertized,"Waating for the pond to estabilize on ITS OWN, this does not work!The company makes good products, what happen here?"
5,Very pleased,I was having problems with my yard fountains due to algae growth. Worked like a charm all summer. I will buy it again.
3,worked ok,"Was looking to get some algae off the rocks in the water, but this product didn't really do as much as I had expected and heard, plus the shipping cost more then the product, but that was my bad for not paying attention to my order well enough"
2,Amateur video,"The content on the DVD is OK, the presenters are affable BUT it is really a poorly produced DVD, a home job and it's hard to get past that.No lighting was used and the male instructor is mostly shadowed and his face is rarely clear.There are pure white posters and windows behind them which shimmer throughout the piece and are distracting (again, a lighting issue).There is NO menu for the DVD. You have to go through everything to get to what you want. You can click Next, but it takes you to undefined sections. A menu would have been nice.I'm not sure why the male instructor was wearing a tae kwon do uniform for a tai chi piece, but that's a minor nitpick...The ending cheer was kind of goofy but did make me smile...Again, content is OK, but too many production issues make it hard to use. It's more like a home movie or an in-school training DVD, not a professionally produced one."
2,Step,This isn't as much help to me as I thought it would be. I don't find it very motivational. I use it a couple times and then it gets boring. I think I'll be better off if I join the local gym.
5,My favorite pick,"I've been using Gibson heavy picks exclusively for years. Don't ask me why, but they have the density and feel that works for me.The Tao Of Writing: Imagine. Create. Flow."
2,This would've been a nice CD...,... if not for those pretentious voice-overs that totally ruin otherwise decent tracks.
5,looks like a real locomotive!,Molly looks like real locomotive due to her big front wheels. Very beautifully rendered engine. Having a coal cart is nice additional touch.
5,New Friends coming Thomas' way!,"Molly is one of Thomas' new friends featured in Season 9 and ""Tales from the Tracks"" video and DVD. Molly is a yellow powerful engine. She looks like Emily, except with four giant drive wheels. She wants everyone to think the best of her and steams away from any conflict. When Thomas first met her, she was supposed to pull empty trucks but Molly didn't want to. Thomas had an idea to fill up the trucks with stuff to make it a ""Special Special"". Whenever the engines saw her, they were amazed. But when they found out it was fake, Molly learned that she doesn't have to be so popular at all. As seen in the story ""Molly's Special Special""."
4,Does the job,"It does the job of protecting the mattress, the flaps for tucking under the bed come out a lot though. Not sure if it's worth the hassle of having them. My daughter tends to be a wiggle worm though. I suppose without them the pad might not be remotely in the right spot in the morning though. We bought two for a twin bed since she is all over the bed during the course of an evening and I wanted to make sure we were covered. 1 would work for a toddler/crib sized mattress, if you have a twin you will probably want 2."
5,Excellent Soaker Pad,I use this soaker pad in conjunction with cotton training pants to help train my four year old to be dry at night. This pad does a great job soaking up the excess of a full empty when it happens which is A LOT of fluid. Always keeps sheet dry and is just the right size for a twin bed.
4,Good for Young Children and Nighttime Potty Training,"This pad has performed as expected and the extra length on the sides makes it easier to tuck under the mattress to keep it from moving. However, the photo gives the impression of covering more of the bed than it truly does. Take the measurements seriously - don't rely on the photo. I needed to play with it to see where on the bed it would be the most effective."
2,Not Big Enough,"I am not happy with this product at all. It is much too small. Of the 4 times my daughter has peed the bed with this on, three times she's ""missed"". Also, I ended up having to put in under the fitted sheet because it got bunched up so much when she was sleeping. Kinda defeats the purpose of just being able to pull it off quickly in the middle of the night. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because when she did pee on the pad, it didn't leak through. If you want something to pull right off, then get two and put them both on the bed."
5,Great Product,This is very simple to use and protects my daughter's bed. A great investment if you are in the early stages of potty training and your child hasn't mastered sleeping through the night or naps without having an accident. I highly recommend it.
5,Great waterproof pad!! LOVE IT!!,"We bought two of these for our toddler who was going to be on his ""big boy"" bed for the first time. I LOVE THEM!! They are so easy to change in the middle of the night when his diaper leaks and they have held up to numerous washings. They hold a ton of liquid and haven't leaked once. We'll be buying more for our older son who is going to try to make it through the night with no pull-up!! Great buy!!"
5,Saves the night!,The large size of this pad saves the night when an accident happens. Granson was recently potty trained and this pad is a lot easier to change than having to change the entire bed in the middle of the night. Keeps the mattress nice and dry.
4,Good for puppies as well,"I started fostering a 5 week old puppy because he was found abandoned and had nowhere to go. He is adorable and fun to have around during the day and besides house training him, he's pretty easy to take care of. I could get him to a puppy pad or outside during the day but at night he would go without waking me up and then go back to sleep since he was so young. I got very tired of cleaning pee off my mattress and constantly washing my blankets but I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a full cover since I sleep on a full size mattress. This small cover was a good price and big enough to cover the area where he always goes. I do wish it was bigger but it works very well. I would definitely recommended it."
5,works perfectly,"Washes well and is wider than the other brand mattress protector I have so it tucks in better on the sides (and this one is cheaper!) It does seem to have less padding/cushioning than the other but absorbs just as well and doesn't leak. It has a nice smooth sheet feel to the top of it, while our other has a soft fuzzy feel to the top. My 5 year old son doesn't seem to have a preference."
1,Returning,"This pad would probably work fine on a crib mattress, but we have a 2 year old on a twin bed and this pad simply doesn't cover enough area to serve the purpose. We'd need to use 2 at a time and I've found a sheet protector that is a much better option for a sleeper that moves all over the bed during the night. Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector 34x52"". Buy more than one! It saves the day quite often and keeps Mom from having to change the entire mattress pad cover."
3,Does the job but could be better,It does the job but it doesn't stay wrapped around the mattress. In the morning it's almost always never where I left it. Usally it is bunched up to the side.
5,Great!!,"This mat is great! It holds on the bed well as long as the flaps are fully tucked. It absorbs all accidents that may happen and is very easy to clean in washing machine on gentle. Must air dry to make sure the materials don't start to crack in the heat of a dryer. If your kid moves to much then you might want to consider a full mattress cover, but as long your kid doesn't go to the oppisite end of the bed then you are good to go."
3,"Works well, but picture is deceptive regarding size","I bought two of these for our toddler who is using a twin bed and being potty trained. The picture on the cover makes the mattress pad look bigger than it actually is. It only covers about 1/3 of a twin bed so if your child moves around the bed, they will soak the sheets. We have to use both mattress pads at once to cover most of the bed but now we have to launder them more frequently. This pad is probably better for a toddler bed than a twin bed."
3,not as represented on picture,"When I bought a twin size pad, I thought it would cover the mattress as shown. But this picture is shows an infant mattress. This is a bit confusing."
1,Not as pictured,"This pad covers much less of the bed than shown in the picture. The picture is really quite deceptive. I had to return this, and pay return shipping since it will definitely not do the job to protect the bed from accidents. It just doesn't cover enough of the bed. I can't believe the picture is so inaccurate. I even asked my husband, who immediately agreed the picture was completely off."
2,Way too small. Needs to be larger to fit even a small bed,"If your child moves around in the bed and you don't have this positioned exactly where they are they will miss. And it doesn't secure to the bed that well. I would look for something bigger and something that fits the entire bed, not just a small section. I'll probably trash it and get a better one, I don't want to risk ruining my bed if my 3 year old misses the pad.!00% would not recommend it."
5,SOOO Fun!,I got this game for my boss. We took it to a company retreat and had the best time playing it. Most of us were laughing to the point of tears. It doesn't get much better than that. It is one of my top games to play.
1,Unbox Disappointing,Expats beware! I'm extremely disappointed that Unbox is only available in the U.S. This isn't a problem for iTunes...not sure why Amazon can't solve for it like Apple can! Amazon isn't a global company yet.
1,It wasn't the episode that was the problem,"I have been home recovering from surgery and thought a few laughs might help me out. The Amazon videos cut out constantly and I have high quality wifi at my house. I always have to start over with the episodes because of ""connection"" problems. Even though the rest of my internet is totally fine. They are selling a crappy product. Don't buy it."
3,Genrally funny show but horrible attempts at accents,"Occasionally intelligent comedy marred by episodes like ""Winter madness"" where we must suffer (and I do mean suffer) through mediocre writing and worst of all, Moore and others delivering the worst attempts at Boston accents you ever in your life will hear. Imagine grade school kids trying to do an English accents and you get the idea. Forgettable as more of the usual New York wannabee Boston (colleges, sports etc) but other episodes hit or miss also. Some great Tracy moments of course. Meh."
4,Major disappointment compared to seasons 1-3,"I've only watched the first two episodes of season 4, but wow, are they terrible! The writing is extremely weak, and they make up for it with very broad (and bad) slapstick. The wicked, understated humour of earlier seasons is nowhere to be found.Based on what I've seen so far, you should skip this season. Hopefully season 5 is better.edit: I spoke too soon. Season 4 improves massively as it goes along. The first two episodes were an aberration. Four stars."
5,Funny. Smart funny. Laugh while watching alone funny.,"If you're reading this review of season four, I suspect that you've already seen the show. Season four is as strong as the other three. Buy and watch with confidence."
5,Never going to Best Buy again,"Great price, no need to mess with stores, the set came right away, I have Prime and it came even faster than it said it would. I will definitely buy more."
4,A good intro to S4 of 30 Rock,"I'll have to disagree with the previous reviewer. I thought this was pretty good season opener. Maybe not the best ever, but it certainly wasn't bad or lame.This episode had some really funny moments and one liners, including:* Tracy's attempt to reconnect to his roots.* Josh getting mad and quitting the show.* Country Jenna.* Len as a Page* Liz and Pete admitting why they were sneaking around together.* The show close with Donaghy and Lemon (Jay Leno).Overall, I thought this episode was really solid, and deserves better than a 2 star rating."
5,Inflamed my passions then let me down...,"The only problem with this excellent bit of artistry is its LENGTH!Just as I get into the flow of this excuisite masterpiece it ENDS after only four tracks! Yes, I realize my compact disc player has a 'repeat' function, and in this case I used it many times. But listening to the same 4 tracks 100 times in a 24-hour period gets a little old after a while! Especially with...I was convinced that Ava Cadell was a true up-and-comer in the 'music' industry, I'm shocked that she hasn't been on tour in my area recently. If any other like-minded fans would like to chat online about her incomparable beauty and finesse, please join me at www.avacadell.com ----I paid BIG BUCKS for this domain name!!!"
4,"It is what it is, and it's not what it's not","For a quick cheap meal that stores well and requires very little effort, Lipton Noodle Soup is a pretty good choice. It tastes like chicken noodle soup (well, sort of), which is what you'd expect, and is fairly good if you rate it against what it's supposed to be. It has a good long shelf life, so you don't have to worry too much about tossing it in the pantry and pulling it out when you next find it.Great for camping, day trips, or just if you don't feel like anything complicated. Time to mix it up? Just add water.It's not gourmet (and it's not supposed to be). The consistency is a little off, flavor different than you'd expect for fresh, and boy is this stuff salty. But what did you expect? It's soup in a box, and it serves its purpose. If you wanted gourmet, you wouldn't be getting it from a box anyway.It does what it's supposed to do well, and that's what matters."
1,just not as good as it used to be,"I don't mind the taste with the lower sodium, in fact am glad, but changing the distinctive square shaped noodles to round ones has in my mind ruined the texture and taste of the soup. I'm using a generic brand now made by Safeway which still has the square noodles, typical of German noodles. I think also the round noodles are just cut off angel hair pasta and don't have the nice flavor of real egg noodles."
1,A BIG MISTAKE !,"I sampled the product when I received it and was disappointed to say the least. I threw the entire order in the trash. I lost about $80.00, but I learned that I should sample before I buy. Ralph Rivera Mesa, Az"
3,ok,there could have been more in the pack for the pricebut the stick well and my daughter is happy they could have also been a little larger
5,Excellent for holiday labeling,I use the 'black on metallic blue' labels to label all my blueberry preserves. I also use these in place of regular gift tags on gift-wrapped presents.
3,product quality has some flaws,"some key function wrong, like suppose if you want to input a number, which need you hold shift while press the key, but some key just work the reverse way as it should be."
2,JazzFan,"The group seemed a little lackluster compared to what I've heard from them in the past. I wouldn't recommend, sorry."
3,Talented Artists - Great Images - Awful Prose,"The photographs in this book are ... well ... amazing. Most of the most famous war photographs are included in this collection, and you will seen some, if not all of them before. But, it's nice to have them all together. Most of the captioning alongside the images shows that the photograhers are self-centered, egotistical social misfits (like most great artists) with an incredible eye for light and composition."
3,"3 stars for the photos, none for the ideology","""it's the journalists' write-ups beside the photos that I found intriguing""Me, too. When one of the photographers expressed his admiration for the Viet Cong - who were at the time conducting mass extra-judicial executions during the occupation of Hue during the Tet Offensive - I was...intrigued.The write-ups indeed cast a not-so-flattering light on the subtle way that photographers ""in the trenches"" can be deluded into supporting the murderous ""militants"" that use them for their propaganda."
4,Great appreciation of what a war photographer goes through,Great appreciation of what a war photographer goes through. Intense and famous photos included in this book. Get this one.
2,Not as advertised,"I gave this a 2 star because it is not what it says it is. The cover of the DVD says Yoga for Tennis Elbow and Bad Knees but in reality it is just a regular yoga session.There's no specialized poses for the elbows or knees; in-fact, some of these poses won't be possible for people who are hurting from tennis elbow or bad knees.As a long time yoga practitioner and teacher; I don't like it when someone says it is one thing and turns out not to be. Remember the integrity of yoga when youmake your DVDs."
4,Yoga for Tennis Elbow,"This DVD is labeled as for everybody, But was a little advanced for my tastes. The exercises are very good as a workout. I would have more preferred to have a little more explanation as to how to switch between the poses as I kept finding myself asking ""How did she get to that pose?"" I definitely will keep using it and hope to progress to this level of flexibility."
2,Less than expected,"Good for a coffee-table book, with some spectacular photography. However, the actual information on the plants is not in-depth, and the book does not cover a very wide range of plants. I would not recommend this book for a serious gardener or researcher, as there is not enough information to make it worthwhile."
4,Wubbzy Boo,Our four year old loves Wubbzy and this halloween one is one of his favorites.We watch it often before bedtime; particularly near Halloween.
2,difficult read,bought this for a college class. it is a very difficult read and i would suggest graduate students would even have difficulty understanding it. it is definitely not something you would pick up for some casual reading. i really dont know who would want this book unless it was required reading for a class as was my case.
4,Kaja's Kase,"Kaja Silverman does an excellent job of describing the history and philosophy behind semiotics. She has a compendium of knowledge about the many pioneers of semiotics and summurizes each individuals contribution, such as Derrida, Saussure, and Barthes.Like Josheph Campbell (""The Hero with a Thousand Faces""), Silverman focuses on psycoanalysis and Freudian thought to help solidify semiotics as a modern form of literary criticism.For anyone interested in semiotics or just wanting to get a general view of how this discipline can be utilized in literature, film, and popular culture ""The Subject of Semiotics"" is the perfect place to explore."
3,Math Intensive Marketing,"Only for those people who are mathematically well versed and are in Marketing Analytics + Strategy. If you are not, don't buy this book."
3,Convenient Potassium Supplementl,"Vet Solutions Renal K+ has been an easy-to-administer treatment for my cat's chronic potassium deficiency. If you have ever tried to give pills to a cat you know how much fun that is (not)! This gel makes my cat's treatment so much easier. Squeezing it from a syringe into the corner of her mouth so she doesn't taste it makes it go down pretty uneventfully. It's just too bad that it is not manufactured in another flavor other than maple syrup. That's definitely a dog flavor!So, Vet Solutions, listen up and offer your Renal K+ in tuna, chicken, or liver flavors and you will win some feline fans!"
2,you can do better,"Why buy this sub when u can get the psw 505 at the same price? It has a larger driver, more power and a lower frequency response. the 505 is not much bigger as far as size goes, but It's totally different in performance. I had a psw 10 for 2 days. It was the poorest excuse for a subwoofer I have ever seen. All you could hear was woofer flutter and excessive port noise. I returned it with intentions on buying the psw110 or the 12in. Model. Then I found the psw 505 for $189, shipped! It is a GOOD sub. Most people consider it to be wonderful, but I have owned truly excellent subs like Definitive Technology and velodyne, so I know What it takes to bring a 5 star rating. The lesson here is do your research. You'll be glad you Did."
4,Sound Power,"The companies, Amazon & Vanns, sent me the wrong color subwoofer, but they did offer to replace it. The subwoofer performance has been excellent, providing an adequate bass boost to complement my existing Bose 301 speakers."
4,A good summation,"Although the information is basic common sense, it does help to have it spelled out in an organized matter with issues and solutions. Was able to highlight topical info to discuss with someone with a short attention span! Bite sizes."
4,Great read !!,"This book is a great read, especially if you work with children or are an educator. The author did a great job. However, I gave this 4 stars because it has so many punctuation errors that I had trouble reading certain parts. I was very disappointed because this book is probably on hundreds of shelves in the world. Writeread press published this book, and they did a horrible job. There are typos and there are missing quotation marks when dialogue is being presented. For such a great story and a heck of a read, it should be written by a much better publisher. Was very disappointed in that, but I still thought it was a great book. The abuse that the author and the rest of the children in this book was so unfair and it made me shake my head while reading, page after page of the torture of this sadistic woman who claimed to ""care about children"".Please take a great look into this book. You won't regret it"
5,Quality work as usual,"When you're reading a certain kind of book, coming to its ending is a bit of a shock. You've grown so accustomed to the characters and the world they inhabit, that it's utterly startling to turn the last page and realize (once again) that they only live their lives inside the head of the author - Raymond Austin! The Eagle Heist is such a book.The characters are interesting and powerful. The writing is fast paced and good to the last word. I read his second book first my mistake, ""Dead Again"" but was not disappointed in any way. This too is a satisfying thriller. With the track record of this writer I am surprised both of his books have not been turned into a film, or television show yet."
4,A VERY GOOD FIRST FROM Raymond Austin,"From TV director to the book. Very good transition. This is a good read. Lots of action, the story keeps moving to a good ending."
5,Would readily recommend this book to all PI fans.,The is a very good read. You will fall in love with Beauford Sloan. A real PI.
5,PRAISE for RAYMOND AUSTIN & HIS BEAUFOED SLOAN.,Austin has combined a terrific story with great characters for a fabulous read. A riveting tale well laid out pacing from start to finish. This is a new voice in P I genre. Hope we hear more of Austin's Beauford Sloan.
5,THE EAGLE HEIST READS GREAT TO THE END PAGE,Austin's P I Beauford Sloan adds substance and depth to crime fiction. This is on PI yarn you will not want to put down.
2,Are you kidding me?,"This is just a mediocre book from beginning to end. The acutal ""heist"" itself is fairly interesting, but is over before it begins. The villains are uninteresting, the ""mastermind"" is poorly developed and I was able to spot him with 80 pages left to go. The fact that our ""hero"" is a) supposed to look exactly like Wilford Brimley and b) beds every attractive woman he meets is just ludicrous and makes the entire book almost farcical. The villain goes on a killing spree"
2,I LIKE BEAUFORD SLOAN,This is a good read. It flows and kept my attention until the very last page. I'm a Beauford fan. Thanks to Raymond Austin. More.
5,"A PI TO REMEMBER, BEAUFORD SLOAN",This could turn out to be a winner. Good plot. Good ending. Ready for another case for Beauford.
4,Beauford Sloan is a good P.I. Hope he stays on the job,I'm not to sure about this love lifr of Beauford. But it's a good tale. Lots of action. Good cop work. Hope he is going to become a front runer P.I.
4,New PI on the block.,"Beauford is down to earth and a hit wwith me. Fast moving plot, and exciting from the word go."
5,ONE OF THE BEST P.I. I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME,"Good luck to Beauford Sloan and Raymond Austin, the man that brought him to life. And he has brought him to life on the page. Love his eye for detail. His lead up to the plot. He also keeps a sub plot going in the background that keeps you thinking. This TV director is a find. Why so long coming to the fore. More pleased."
4,Likeable Characters and a well-written book,"This story, while formulaic, is a quick read containing likeable--make that VERY likeable--characters. Beauford Sloan, the wily PI, is a man you want to know. In fact, you wish he lived next door. Glad to know I can keep him in my life by reading the series.A good mystery and I recommend the read.From the author of I'm Living Your Dream Life and The Things I Wish I'd Said."
2,PRAISE FOR THE EAGLE HEIST & RAYMOND AUSTIN,Austin has combined a terrific story with excellent characters for a marvelous read. This is his first book in the Beauford Sloan series. I really look forward to the next.
5,What our childhoods SHOULD have been like.,"I read this a hundred years ago and loved it. I was too young to understand about sexual equality back then, so was a little frustrated that the story was about boys and didn't include girls. However, that did not stop me from loving this book. I wanted to be one of the boys, I wanted to have a club like theirs, I wanted to enjoy my childhood the way they did.I haven't read this book since way back when, but I'm looking for a copy of it now for my nephew. This is one of the books that convinced me that reading was fun. I didn't want it to end. I remember, after finishing this book, closing the cover and saying to myself; ""Wow!"""
3,Chicken Soup for the Buddhist Soul?,"An anecdote of many feel-good stories written by an ordained monk of the Theravada school of Buddhism, the book is simply written and contains some canonical discourses relevant to the situation described in each chapter. Try not to read it as a biography or a self-help book; most people who do so will be sorely disappointed. However, it is a comforting work that leaves one feeling a little more hopeful, and perhaps that's what the bhiku is aiming for and nothing more. The collection is not an explanatory work on Theravada Buddhism and does not really cover the ""tenets"" of that sect per se. However, since Buddhism relies less on vicarous experience than on personal, individual experience, the lack of theology may even be a good thing! I did find the stories to become a bit too formulaic, but none-the-less they were all heart-warming and at times even humorous."
5,Love it,"I get compliments all the time on this fresh scent. I like wearing a bit of fragrance, but did not want to be one of those women whose perfume precedes them into the room by 15 feet. I also found that I no longer enjoyed flowery scents. So I searched and tried many perfumes for quite a while... and then found this. I hope they don't discontinue it!!"
3,Movement Books,"I purchased this book and have been teaching for 10 years. I can honestly say, it would be a great resource for a first year teacher, however, a more seasoned teacher who has had Kodaly' level one and higher really won't benefit from it a whole lot. First and second year teachers, I would recommend this one for you or for college students taking an elementary music class."
4,TWO-FISTED ACTION,"As a fan of the GEOBREEDERS anime, I decided to check out the manga, and I wasn't disappointed. The action is fast and furious, and the girls are jiggly delights.There's such massive destruction during the action scenes that GEOBREEDERS really feels like a big-budget Hollywood movie. This is definitely a great read for any action-movie fan."
4,"Decent, fun workout","I was looking for a core/legs/buns workout that I could do with my baby. This fit the bill. I found the exercises to be easy, but if you're an experienced exerciser, you can easily modify what the instructor is doing to make it more difficult for yourself (e.g. do real pushups instead of girl pushups).My baby liked it, and was laughing and smiling during the floor exercises. You get some good face time with baby and plenty of chances to kiss/ hug/ smile at him or her during the workout. I haven't quite figured out know how I feel about my baby seeing be grunt and sweat, though...One thing I'm not sure that's clear from the product description- you need a carrier (like a Baby Bjorn or something) to do part of the workout."
2,Just ok...,"This DVD is ok, but not what I expected and very boring. I expected more interaction with the baby, but basically your holding the baby doing squats, lunges, etc. I have a very active baby who did not want me holding him for the exercises for more than five minutes."
2,Baby Not Impressed,"Despite reading reviews from other mothers who's babies thought this video was great fun, my baby was not impressed. She fussed everytime I tried to do it. Also, I tried it with her around 3 months of age and cannot imagine using much past 4-5 months because she would be way too heavy for the arm motions for me to do the moves safely with her."
2,My son hated it,"I thought that this would be a ton of fun but my son absolutely hated it. It was too much tossing around for him. But every child is different, you know? It just wasn't our cup of tea."
4,Easy to follow.,This video was pretty easy to follow and seemed to be for first time users. The only thing was after i did the workout with my 11 month old daughter i felt as if it didn't do much. Well that was until the next morning when i could barely move. It was worst than a regular workout. I had muscles hurting that i didn't even know i had. So i guess it is a good program if you are willing to suffer through like anything else. I would reccomend this only if you want an intense workout. I am still feeling the burn!
3,Eater knows Repetition,"The first time i heard Eater was off a little 45 record, the first was song ""thinking of the USA"", i gave it a good review.I was unaware of this bands'age nor did i care. It was a good song.I gave listen to more of their songs and I was disappointed, due to the fact I expected much more. You can expect a lot of repetition as most all their other songs,as they sound the same and are dull. Young age or not, this band was in my view a""one chord wonder""...this band rates'Three'stars Only."
3,Correct product features,"In the details of the product indicates that the drive comes in English language and one of the subtitles is in Spanish. This is the fact that is wrong and that the movie is in English and German language and has no subtitles.On the other hand should be make clear that the Amazon service is excelnte what regarding the shipment of products, compliance with the delivery time."
2,Missed the Mark,"Fairly happy with the 3D effects however, being a soccer fan, I thought the interviews dragged and was expecting to see more of the dramatic action. Teams like Chile, USA, and many others had VERY short clips, if any at all and some of the best goals of the tournament weren't even shown. The journalists being interviewed were in 3D but, they just sat in one setting and added very little to the overall excitement of the film.(very very boring). I would have liked to have seen more of the fanfare as well; and the dramatic ""buildup"" story was flat and felt rushed.Overall not very satisfied."
3,Beware international buyers,"Only english and german audio. NO SUBTITLESIt's only 720p and it's only 1:04 lenght, I would like more action soccer time.The 3D view is spectacular.__________________________________Unicamente audio en ingles y alemán. NO TIENE SUBTITULOSLa resolución es únicamente de 720p, dura solo 1:04, me hubiera gustado mas tiempo de partidos.El 3D es impresionante."
2,Disappointing,"This was a very concise summary of the World Cup, skipping most of the teams (including USA), focusing instead on the future winners and runner's up. I wanted to re-live much more than the road these teams took to the final. Where's the rest of the tournament?!!3D was great."
3,"Good production, just okay 3D","For those of you who had trouble viewing this disc I had the same blank screen after the menu selection. I accessed the Samsung Update Option within my Blu Ray player and that seemed to fix it.As for the viewing experience it's finally good to seem some sports in 3D. The production is very good as the narrative highlights the more interesting matches of the WC. The 3D however is just okay. Perhaps it's the 720p standard or some other factor but this is one instance where the 3D only ""drops back"" and never really comes at you as it does on some features. Nonetheless, it's live action sports and if Comcast can't get 3D in my top-ten market then, well, this will have to do for now.I bought mine used for $20 so I can't complain. All-in-all, good for a viewing but not something that will impress the critical eye."
5,Wonderful book!,"Ths book ""Fatima, The Story Behind The Miracles"" was very enjoyable to read and well documented! I would highly recommend it! After reading the book, I went to portugal and loved visiting Fatima. Portugal is a beautiful country to visit! I have purchased several copies of this book to give as gifts."
1,The story out of the History,"Yes, we can deal with Fatima events from two ways: 1) by faith and assuming that the official version of this kind of books, made by foreigners without factual basis or 2) in historical grounds searching to look on the original documents and analyse them outside the cultural interpretation of the marian apparitions kind. This is the great problem of almost books on Fatima: they are more ""fatimists"" than Fatima itself and use the imagination without control in a fundamentalist quest that is blind to the true documents reality.When the faith lead the writer we can do anything but see all theseapproaches as a story that is out of History."
3,Still Quite a Bit of Glare,"Although there is less reflection, there is still quite a bit of glare in the screen. We are having to close down the blinds with this screen to make the screen readable. My other flat screen monitors do not have this effect."
3,Computer screen cover,The product fitted the screen of my computer perfectly. Arrived well packed and in excellent condition. Only problem I have is that if accidentally knocked the adhesive strip doesn't hold it in place. Would recommend the product.
5,Awesome Racing Game!,"I am not much for racing games, but this game has most racing games beat! At first, you don't get many cars. However, once you start playing the career, you get many more cars with different attributes, and it makes everything worth your while! If you don't like racing, then this isn't for you, but if you have a glimmering hope, then try it! You never know, you may fall in love this game! I know I did..."
3,not very fun.,this game has great graphics but something is just wrong with it. not real cars. on this game you win nice sports cars sometimes but whats the use of screwing it up by crashing all the time in this game. the whole game is based on crashing. pretty much only one thing is cool about this. the sounds of sports cars. i would by something else.
2,Very disappointed,"After seeing all the reviews and playing another driving game (Project Gotham Racing 2 - PGR2), I was expecting a great game, basically PGR2 with more intense crashing. I returned the game after one night of playing.The driving physics feels very poor after playing PGR2. PGR2 slid more accurately in turns and vibration was used more effectivly in sliding and crashing. Takedown barely used controller vibration. I was hoping that the game was buggy and an XBOX live update would have fixed it, but to no avail."
5,"Minor faults aside, this is one amazing racing game!","Having been a huge fan of Burnout 1 and 2, I was really looking forward to this release.This truly is an amazing racing game. I love the non linear progression through the world series and the added bells and whistles such as the 'crash FM' announcer.Graphically it is different to both Burnout 1 and 2. Personally I feel that not as much detail has been given to the buildings, however everything is moving so fast that you don't really have time to notice it.One major complaint for me is the lack of the vibrational effect. I thought the effect added so much to the previous burnout games - drive over cobbled stones for instance and the controller vibrates madly. In Burnout 3 there is some slight vibration during some crashes. That's it. Though this is one minor glitch in an otherwise hard to fault game.I rarely pay full price for games but just couldn't wait for Burnout 3!!! Hopefully there will be a Burnout 4 next year!"
4,I really give this game a 4.5,This game is really fun. I especially like the multiplayer. Buy this game!
4,Fun racing/wrecking game!,My cousin told me about this game and when we rented it we had SO much fun! Im notorious for my wrecking in real life so this is a good way to wreck and not get hurt lol. Its a real fun game but dont play too much or it turns into the same thing over and over.
2,No Cover Art Included,No art work! I was really bummed that my xbox game came in a blank (and damaged) DVD case. What not include the cover art for the game?It looks like it came from a used game store with the title scrawled on with a pen. Not very professional IMO. If you want art work with your game like most folks do I suggest trying a different seller.
5,A GOOD READ,"The hero (Balfour) and heroine (Mauldie) are enemies -- yet the hero doesn't realize this right away -- he believes he's found a nursemaid (of course she's a stunning beauty and on a secret mission for vengence) for his battle wounded brother (Nigel)...Mauldie soon realizes who the handsome warrior is...but decides to hide her identity as he's the one she'd swore vengence against. She grudgingly nurses his brother, while all the time warding off seductive advances from Balfour...Through a series of dangerous events and intrigue, the prideful couple realizes their strong love for one another -- but are stilled separated by deceit and misunderstandings...Mauldie & Balfour seems well matched, strong characters and this story ends beautifully. I would recommend this title."
2,meh...,This book was not bad but at the same time not good. It seemed to drag forever. I also didn't think the characters had much depth and you really couldn't feel their passion and why they were instantly attracted to each other. The storyline was good and had promise. I will try the next book and if it's more of the same I'm done with this series.
2,Lost interest,I got thru less than half of the book. Too much Scottish dialog. Hard to follow story. Had to keep stopping to figure out what author is trying to say. I probably will not finish this book.
3,This book was ok not great,This book was somewhat interesting but I did not like the hero very much and there were a few times I almost put the book away I was so frustrated with the hero's behavior. I decided to finish it but I don't think I will read anymore of the series.
1,Not my cup of tea,"I kept waiting for a real story, instead of bedroom scenes. I gave up after 6 chapters and returned it to the library. Boy I'm glad I didn't buy this dog."
3,good for cheap kind,This was very cheap transparency which is basically why I bought it. If you are doing something with a lot of blacks then you will probably want to spring for the more expensive brands. But if you aren't using too much saturated color it works pretty well.
5,Very good stuff if you use the right settings,I use these on my old 1280 printer. I DO NOT however use the transparency setting when printing. If you do that you get a low resolution faint looking image. I use the Backlight film setting and it comes out looking very rich and crisp. This transparency takes the ink just fine and looks amazing.
1,Worst transparency paper ever....,Meant to be for ink jet printers and fails miserably. Looks like a dot-matrix low res result from the early 1990s.
5,Wow!,"I was really surprised at how well these inkjet transparencies worked. They don't smudge at all. When you first look at the sheet it looks kind of foggy, but when it's printed and put on a different surface, you couldn't see any fog at all. Great product."
3,A Marvelous Writer & Storyteller.,"Rosemary Rogers has been entertaining bored housewives for twenty-five years and more with her wild romances. I think the first one of her I read was 'Sweet Savage Love,"" but it could hve been 'Wicked Loving Lies.' She brought love into our lives vicariously and with a flare no one else could come close to, except James Robert Waller with his 'Bridges of Madison County,' and that one was written from a woman's viewpoint.For some twenty-two novels, her main thrill was the voracious love stories between one man and one woman. Ginny and Steve were my favorites of her couples. Of course, Ginny is a real strong-minded woman, and so am I. I had a Steve but he, alas, could not compare to Steve Morgan. Now, she is writing about nurses. That couldn't possibly be controversial, but I could care less about hospitals.She is a marvel, wherever she is, and brought something into our lonely lives no one else could, except for a real Steve Morgan."
1,"i wish there was a ""no stars"" category","After all the reviews that I read, I expected this to be a masterpiece. I was so, so disappointed after reading even the first few pages (much less the rest of the book) to find that it is the most self-gratuitous, egotistical, reader-patronizing, poorly written book I have ever encountered. It was not helpful to me in any way, shape or form. It is not inspirational, enjoyable, or even anecdotal. At least it is short with big font."
4,Anxious to receive it,Breathing explanation good. David has a pleasant speaking voice. The flute music distracts me from focusing on the breathing.
5,The Reluctant Healer,"The Reluctant Healer has provided me with daily practical tools to keep me moving forward in every area of my life with clarity, focus and purpose. It is humorous, down to earth and easy to understand."
1,Misleading hype for product.,"Bought Intellimover to transfer files between two MS XP PC's. Sounds like a snap when you read Nova's literature, but cable connection will not work. The appropriate USB cable drivers are simply not available and the connection cannot be made between the two machines. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY."
1,Instructions misleading,"Do not use this product if you intend to move data to a ""new"" computer that has an operating system older than the source system. I attempted to move data from an XP system to a Win98SE system and got an error message. No where on the packaging is there a warning to this effect."
1,Simply Didn't Work!!,After many attempts and spending hours on the phone with the product reps. They suggested I just return it.I have a late model Dell PC. I hope it works on other computers. What a waste of time.
1,Worthless!,"I had no problem moving my settings (hence the one star) but was informed I had to install my programs from the original disk. Not good if you don't have the disk. I feel the advertising is misleading and overall this software is a waste of money. Do like the other guy, get an external hard drive and move programs and files that way."
1,A big NO - GO .. total BOMB,"Simple transfer .. R51 Thinkpad to R60 .. followed Intellimover protocol completely .. 2 hours after making connection .. the transfer time is 4,607 hours for 5GB of data .. no thank you. I manually transferred all the date in about 3 1 /2 hours ..Also Intellimover does NOT transfer .exe files, i.e. you have to install all the programs on the new computer. And the initial advertising is misleading .. Ethernet cable not included in box.Returning to Amazon tomorrow! Thanks for nutting."
1,I'm screwed,I'm very fustrated by this product. I spent hours attempting to use it to transfe files to a new computer running Widows Vista unsuccesssfully!Reviews I read said this was possible but I must be a dummy because I couldn't get it to work. And after about an hour on hold I gave up trying to talk to tech support. Since I let this sit for more than 30 days I can't even get my money back.
4,Wonderful!,I have the casette of this and needed the cd... wonderful i love that Rita Springer sings praise through out this ...
5,One of my favorite worship albums.,"It is hard to capture the essence of an album in a written review. If one has already heard Rita Springer, then you will already know that her voice is powerful and emotive. She traverses easily from the strong and forceful to the soft and whispering. Her ability to convery through subtle accents on the words is amazing. The listener is not left with the impression that this woman can ""perform"" as Celine Dion does, but that the words, music and meaning are heartfelt and come through clearly.The tone of worship is not what I would call ""intimate"" like Andy Park, but majectic, regal or reverent. Some songs reference worship ceremonies of the old testament in the Temple. The description makes you feel as though you are there.All I can say is that I have over 100 worship CDs in my collection presently, and this is one that stays in my car for frequent listening, and has for the past several years. I strongly recommend it."
1,For those over 200lbs.,"I have never been a fan of aerobic exercise, but I love step aerobics. I live in a 850sqft condo in San Francisco, so I have very little space to exercise. Step aerobics is perfect for small spaces. It is unfortunate that this company makes such a flimsy product, it will not support my 245lbs. So, if your over 200lbs and want to start step aerobics I would consider the NORDIC TRACK STEPPER. It will hold up to 250lbs, and it comes with a DVD with 2 routines, beginner and intermediate, which I have been doing 3 days a week for 7 months, and am still having fun doing. It is adjustable and looks a lot like the Reebok 5-Position Step Deck that they sell here on Amazon. I found mine at sears online, it was $49.99. Don't waste your money on this inferior product, spend less and get a better product."
3,It's a plastic step,"Yeah, it's the original, but hey, it's a plastic step. If you look around you and if you've got some skills, and if you've got the time, you probably can fashion a similar functional item out of things you find around the house, at a garage sale, and even at the dump (because that is probably where many of these end up after a few years of non-use."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"Perfect. And I'm so glad they aren't the corny looking violet and teal, 80's throw back boards. Only one gripe: a few of the rubber mats that stick to the top of the board had come up. I just stuck them back down and they seem to be fine now. The best part was the super saver shipping! I can't wait till Amazon has some more to sell."
1,Waste of 100.00.........,This step is a waste of money........100.00 for a step that doesnt feel sturdy at all......you have to be careful of how you use it.....It may be good for light step workouts but if you want to do a high impact step program like a Jillian Micheals work out this step is not good at all......Just something else that will be put in the trash or in the garage......I advise not to buy this item......The reebok step is a better choice...
4,STEP EQUIPMENT,The product is great and works as described. Most of my clients however want a higher step so I have to purchase 4 total more of the blocks. The item is sturdy and can easily handle a 200 lb body plus 50 lbs of dumbells in the hands without the slightest visibility of any stress on the equipment.
3,OK step,"This step is OK, but not as good as the Reebok step. The ridged deck tends to catch on the soles of your shoes and you have to be careful to seat the step on the risers just right. If you need to turn the step during your workout, you can't do it quickly because the risers don't attach, they just sit under the platform. Still, it's a way better step than those cheapie $19.95 plastic ones. Sturdy and stable as long as you get the risers in the right place."
4,Exactly as described,"Ordered the step as I had seen other ones in department and sporting stores and just wasn't happy with the quality.. The Step is exactly as they describe it, arrived quickly and is much more sturdy than other I had seen."
4,good,"Nice quality plastic that is sturdy but light to put away and set up.So happy there is a neutral black/gray color that will wear well and is not party purple/blue.Site says up to 200 lbs, included instructions say up to 300 lbs.Slightly noisier than expected --- when stepped on it makes slight thunking noise as pieces shift slightly but always sturdy, never feels like it will tip over."
5,Very pleased with the product and service,I was very pleased with the condition of the step. It also arrived very quickly.
5,Professional size step makes all the difference,"I've been doing step aerobics for years on the smaller econo model. Having a professional sized step makes the routines more fun and more challenging. I wouldn't trade it for anything. The different heights make it versatile enough to use it in circuit training workouts, too. It's awesome...everybody who loves stepping should have one."
5,A great way to get in shape!,"Many years ago, I taught step aerobics and this is the step we used at the YMCA. I love having my own and it's fun recalling old step moves and teaching my 10 year old daughter.This is a sturdy step and it's wide enough and long enough to use with any video available."
4,Great step but small defects,"This is a great step and overall I am very pleased with it. It is sturdy and is wide enough to allow me to do anything on the step video I watch. My only issue (and why I gave it only 4 stars) is that the plastic covering on the top seems to scratch easily. Mine came with an air bubble and maybe that is why the top is not ""set"" correctly... not sure. It does not affect my ability to use the step, it is mainly cosmetic, but it does look like it is worn more than it has been used. I would still recommend this product."
5,Excellent Step!,"This is the exact same size and type of original health club Step as used by Cathe and other instructors in the majority of thier home workout dvds! I had the home-size Step first and didn't like how unstable it was due to the smaller size, so I purchased this one from Amazon. It is more stable and safe to use if directions for use are followed correctly. Hard sturdy plastic with rubber traction, came with 4 risers. Besides stepping, its great to use for a weight bench. Amazon shipped it fast too!"
5,I love this step!,This step is exactly like the ones at the gym. That is the reason I bought it. I also have the smaller home model. I don't like it at all. Don't waste your money on it. This one is great!Good solid piece of equipment.
3,Great product if you're under 200lbs,"The good:It's lightweight, assembles easily.The bad:It shouldn't be used with weights if you're over 200lbs.I'm around 210 and standing in the center, it sinks and flexes way too much.Stand in the middle, towards the edge and you sink into it (I do).It isn't as sturdy as the Reebok version. The base blocks make it easier for it to tip over while you're using it."
3,Great Size but LOUD!,"I purchased the original ""Step"" for the size. Most sporting goods stores sell a cheaper in price but also smaller version of a step. A step truly kicks up your cardio a few notches and with this size, it's convenient for doubling as a weight bench.Once caveat, and it's pretty big for me as an apartment dweller, it is loud!! The step is hollow and echos - when I do more cardio intense exercises (jumping jacks using the step), you can't hear anything else."
4,Good but could be a bit better,"Just bought this step for my wife. Pulled it out of the box. No instruction manual or warranty slip was included. Not sure if its supposed to or not?The pieces fit together OK but are a little loose. I would have hoped for a better ""click"" in place or snap so it doesnt slide ever so slightly.Works but was expecting a little better interlock system for this price.Make sure you put a towel down on the non-skid top if you plan to do push ups or lay down for bench press or do those behind dips with your hands behind you as it will make nasty marks in your hands as the non-skid rubber top really digs in.Still a good size step for a good price.Would have liked it to have 1 one riser included as it seems its still a little short. If you measure the 8"" max height its a little shy of 8"""
4,Great product!,"I love this product. It is sturdy and slip-proof. I like the gradations of height and the vibrant colors. My only beef perhaps would be that the grooved lines on the step surface are hard to clean. Other than that, it's well worth the money spent."
4,Strudy Step but black cover was already ripping off when I got it,I had this step in undergrad and had to give it away when I was travelling abroad so I brought it again but when I recieved it the black plastic is coming off; nevertheless it doesn't interfere with the work out. I am loving the step and step aerobics.
5,Just like the gym,This step is great! It stores easily in a corner of my apt. and it is just like the step bench at the gym. So you can bring that gym workout home. It's worth the extra cost for the extra burn!
5,Step F1011W Review,I looked around on the internet and local stores before making this purchase. The online price from Amazon was lower than any other source and the step was delivered quickly. Quality and stability is just like the step we use at the gym...first rate!
4,"Overall great, one minor complaint.","Overall I like this step. It's a simple design, sturdy, and I can jump all over it with no worry of it anything sliding out of place or the risers shifting. My only complaint is the black, ribbed (for lack of a better term) top part is very hard. I sit on the step and use bands underneath it to do arm exercises and if you're wearing thin shorts it kinda hurts your butt. Likewise I use the step to do push-ups and putting your bare hands on the top is painful so I have to wear my gloves for lifting when I do push-ups or put a towel on it. Honestly just minor things though because overall I really like it and use it all the time."
5,Same Step you find at the gym,"I spent a lot of time looking for the 'right' step - ie the same one you find at the gym and this is it. It is regular length and came with 4 risers. I am very, very happy to have found this - I almost bought a shorter one as I had not found this one. LOVE IT. And I found the price to be very reasonable compared to what I would have paid for a 'shorter' one."
3,leather case,"It's not that bad of a case. You can take the clip off if you don't want it on when you're not running. When you run with it on, it does swing a little bit, but nothing bad. Go for an armband holder if you want to run with your iPod."
5,Miracle drops,"I am not into health food remedies at all and only take vitamin supplements my doctor prescribes. Once when I was really getting a bad sore throat, the owner of my local health food store recommended this product. He said the second his kids have signs of a cold, he gives it to them. I tried it and to my amazement, it works every time -- I never wait until the budding symptoms settle in and I usually take this and take to my bed for a day right at the beginning and voila all gone. I've never gotten anything at Duane Reade or by prescription that's better. BTW, I disagree with all the comments about tasting awful. It has a vaguely alcohol, peppermint undertaste but I dont mind it at all. I see the price varies greatly. I pay $20 at my place. Give it a try. Bess H"
5,great,"this item was ok just as I expected I wish you didnt have to comment here on every thing, one two three four five six seven"
2,Not our favorite...there is better stuff out there!,"We bought Picture Stories from the Bible along with the Comic Book Bible, and the Picture Bible. Our favorite out of the three was the Picture Bible. Feels nice, looks nice, glossy pages, etc. Also, very comprehensive representation of the Bible. We are giving it to kids aged 6-9 for Christmas, and as an adult, I also enjoy reading it. Amazon's price is a real bargain. The Comic Book Bible was okay, more for the younger set and early readers. Picture Stories from the Bible seemed out-dated and was just not as impressive to us. Also, it showed more gruesome details such as Judas hanging from a tree, and blood on Jesus, both of which were unnecessary."
3,"Cool, calm, professional advice.",I enjoyed this style of writing but would have liked more informatio on how to deal with the down and dirty dished out by the other side.
4,Protecting kids from legal battles,I've known Deedra Hunter for years and have found her insights to be practical in protecting kids during legal battles. She will come alongside to act as your 'custody coach' to help you out of the fog of a legal battle to move forward and rebuild your life.
1,This is not just a Woman's issue,"This book has a lot of inspiration but not enough information. I need data not someone patting my hand saying ""There, there, dear."""
1,Are you kidding?,"A woman needs advice on getting custody like a sandwich needs advice to include bread. If you're looking for a positive book on how to make things better, written by a psychologist who's not trying to rationalize her own personal problems, try ""Divorce Poison: Protecting the Parent-Child Bond from a Vindictive Ex"", by Richard Warshak."
3,Most Inspirational Book for Women!,"This is the most inspirational child custody book I have seen. The 8 pages of Index allow women to find thir way through the legal and emotional battle. Personally, I think that custody is more of a parent's issue than a men against women issue. Although this book does not deal with unsual situations, it is worth the $10.00 price."
3,A MILD COMFORT,"IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE ELSE OUT THERE IS IN YOUR SHOES. THE ONLY THING I GOT FROM THIS BOOK WAS THAT YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WEAR TO COURT. NOT BECAUSE OF THE OBVIOUS IMPRESSION THAT YOU WANT TO PROJECT, BUT BECAUSE THERE IS AN IDEA OF THE PERFECT MOTHER IN EVERYONE'S HEADS--AND THAT'S WHO YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE. *EVEN THOUGH THAT OF COURSE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PARENTING ABILITY.A QUICK GLANCE-OVER READ."
5,A bible,"After getting recently interested in Elliott Wave theory, I was recommended to read this book. I must admit that this is the reference book in its segment. A must read item. The perfect bible to regularly refer to."
4,Book I was Looking For,"This is kind of book I was looking for to enhance my basic knowledge about Elliott Wave Theory. First Two chapters of the Book explains in simple language about the basics of Elliott Wave priciple and How to count and identify the wave and trading opportunities. Second Chapter imparts you about application aspect of Elliott Wave priciple such as, Ratio analysis,Longterm Wave formation principle and different approaches to wave principle.Finnaly the Apendix LONGTERM FORECAST UPDATE,1982-1983 summarises the entire principle and provide you an insight."
4,Elliott Wave Principle,Well written and relatively easily understood publication on a somewhat complex if not esoteric approach to the issue.
2,Not A Practical Approach,"Elliott Wave is the least practical approach to Technical Analysis I am aware of. There are so many exceptions to the rules that govern EW that one can never gain enough confidence in the signal to put money to work. They say that if you get 12 EW practitioners in a room you will get 13 different wave counts. Believe me, there's a lot of truth in that statement! I am amazed that people actually take EW seriously.There are plenty of very useful books on Technical Analysis, although there aren't very many well written ones. I recommend any book by John Murphy, and also Trader Vic-Methods of a Wall Street Master which is a tremendous book that will teach you the most important thing to know; how to recognize the trend and when it changes."
2,made for the rocket scientist,"I give Mr. Pretcher's book 2 stars because I'm in a real good mood right now. Realistically, it was a way over my head. I asked ""what time it was?"" and the author is telling me how to build a watch. I had hoped for practical examples in putting Fibonacci retracements to use but found none. It's extremely heavy on theory and is of little practical use to the investor.A disappointment."
5,A gorgeous time capsule,"This is one of the best live recordings I have ever heard in any style of music. Chet, accompanied by orchestra, sounds great here on famous tunes like Davis' 'All Blues' (a wonderful opener before an enthusiastic crowd) and others such as 'I fall in love too easily' and 'My funny valentine'. The orchestra strikes just the right note-never overplaying their hand, but providing Chet with the foundation he needs. I like the fact that most of these performances clock in at over 6 minutes. They are lengthy, but not overly so, they are just right. Baker has never sounded better in my opinion. Sadly, he died shortly after these recordings after falling (some say he was pushed) from a third story window. Years of drug abuse left this formerly handsome go-getter a gaunt, pale man. What a shame.Recommended."
5,all blues,"This is the finest version of All Blues ever recorded, even better than the Miles Davis original. Baker plays in such a poignant, sentimental, and backwards-looking style that it almost seems as if he knew this would be the last time he would ever play it. It brings tears to my eyes..."
5,Chet Baker: HIS WAY,"This is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful Jazz albums ever recorded. Yes, including Kind of Blue. Recorded just two months before his death, Chet Baker had distilled at the end of his life the quality which perhaps he, more than any Jazz artist I've ever heard - owned at the center of his music - silence & stillness. This album testifies to that. I've heard My Funny Valentine so many times before, including the lovely versions, instrumentally & vocally by Mr. Baker. The two versions of the song on this 2cd set are the two most beautiful I've ever heard. Period. His death at the age of fifty-eight - tragic, of course. But not as tragic as if this album had not been recorded. Transformative .... transcendent are just two of the words that describe it. But the best word of all... sheer, unadulterated .... BEAUTY!! Most highly recommended."
3,disappointing ending,"Jessica catches her mystery man...a junior high school admirer. The wedding is called off...by who?? Denise & Winston wash up on a golf-resort island. Liz and Tom seem to make amends. And Nina's beau shows his stuff by waterskiing out to the cruise ship to meet her! Bruce & Lila reunite, and Enid declines the modeling offer from Tisano's brother."
3,OK,"I read this book in July 1999. So I don't remember too much about, but I do know that it wasn't that good. It is a 3 part miniseries, but I didn't realize that at the time, so I only ended up reading this one first. I didn't understand fully what was going on. There is no excitement in this book except when the wedding is practically called off. Maybe it was called off all together, but I can't remember. I do not recommend buying this book. Read #48-50 of this series. I'm on page 63 of #50. It is very interesting."
4,best tranparency on the market,"This by far the best color laser transparency on the market, beats the competition by leaps and bounds.Pros:*crispy color images*no smearing*does not warpwe use this for art projects, contact cards, invitations and the occasional business presentation slides. extremely versatile. highly recommended."
4,A reader from VA,"If you want to learn and to be able to code ColdFusion fast, then this book might NOT be the best choice to start. Be prepared, it will take a very long time to digest all those 1500 pages! The writing style and the topics it covers are super! But... it is too thick! (Not all yet, there is another volume 2 for the more advanced CF stuff.) By the time you reach a half of this book (about 700+ pages), you may not remember much what covers at the beginning, and you probably may not be ready for any CF application work.What made me not to give this book a perfect 5-star because the book doesn't teach what I was looking for:1. The use of JavaScript together with CF code for common functions such as validations or cursor control on the client site.2. Some common CSS styles in CF templates. This would save CF developers a lot time in coding and testing.3. The use of any of the ColdFusion development methodologies such as 'Fusebox', 'CFObjects', 'Black Box', or 'Switch Box',..."
5,The Ultimate CF Bible,"What more could you ask for in a book about CF. The new examples are clear an concise and offer the reader real world examples. Ben and company did a great job. If you are thinking about developing in Cold Fusion, or want to brush up your skills, this is the one book you NEED to get."
5,Superb Coldfusion Resource,"An excellent introduction for those looking to get into coldfusion and a solid reference for those already using it. Covers a good introduction into databases and SQL, then introduces coldfusion and how to access data. Moves on to more advanced topics in the later half of the book."
5,The Ultimate ColdFusion Book!,"I've been using his books for a while and I can say without hesitation that they are the best and most complete ColdFusion books available. Although it is long, there are plenty of examples to keep one busy and learning. It is about 500 pages bigger than the last edition (ColdFusion 4). Great intro to Dreamweaver and Flash integration. Ben Forta writes great books. I recommend it highly."
5,Top ColdFusion seller for a reason,"Excellent reference. Although aimed squarely at new ColdFusion developers, there is enough meat in this book to satisfy experienced developers. Well-written and easy to follow, Forta shows why he is well respected in the CF community. Note that many of the advanced topics present in previous editions have been moved to the ""Advanced"" book."
5,The only book you need for ColdFusion,"If you are ready to get down and into programming in ColdFusion, this book is a must to have. Ben Forta is a respected ColdFusion guru who really knows what he is talking about. This book covers more aspects of ColdFusion no other book can compare. If you are looking for having only ONE book to own on ColdFusion, don't miss this one!"
2,a tragicly written tradgedy,this book states all the facts but what is missing is the first hand accounts of being in the water. the author would have done more justice to the reader interviewing more of the survivors and japanese servicemen. this book is written too much of a second-hand account
3,Good summer reading except for a cruise,"An engaging retelling of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis at the end of WWII. Not exactly a page turner because of the plodding style, but it will keep your attention. Can be a little difficult to follow; I wish the author had provided some schematic drawings of the ship's layout, a map of the general area involved, and a table of the various naval hierachies involved. Some more sophisticated background on the physiology of thirst and exposure at sea would have added to the text. Nevertheless the description of men diving down to their sunken ship in the crazed hope of finding fresh water from its spigots is haunting."
1,Not what you want,"This book can be boiled down to these few words: Eat a balanced diet daily. If you are looking for much of anything else, you will not find it here. Waste of money."
3,Expexted a litte more,When buying on line. It is hard to get the feel of it. It is like a miss or hit unless you have seen the book before.
2,Good for one time only!,"I purchased this remote control shark because it looked really cool, but after just one use in my pool, it got stuck in reverse. I returned it and exchanged it for another one, but after the first usage out of the box, it died. I tried new batteries, but it didn't even turn on anymore. I gave it a try...twice! I would not order this product unless you want to spend the money to play with this shark once, because it's pretty much one and done!"
3,Summary of Behavioral Finance Studies,"This book summarizes the findings of numerous behavioral finance pundits. The author starts with a brief review of pertinent psychology and then addresses topics pertaining to asset management, security analysis and corporate finance. The chapters are broken into small capsules to explain study results on specific topics. I found the subject material interesting but would have liked more detail on how to apply the study findings."
5,This Is My Financial Bible,"This book is jammed packed with lots of information. I'm on my third read of it. It's hard to understand for a novice like myself, but with each subsequent read, I pick up more information. Plus, there's a lenghty bibliography where you can find references to more in-depth research.For anyone who is a student of finance and wants practical, research proven information, this is the book for you!"
5,Good Buy,I was 100% pleased with my purchase. The book arrived within 3 business days and was in the advertised condition.
5,Typical great Blue Sea product,Blue Sea makes some great stuff. This is one of them. Simple and effective. I use it on a mobile solar install and have not had any problems.
3,High Tech Soul: The Creation of Techno Music,Its like the history of Detroit techno meets big brother(very bitchy)
4,Good Overview,"This book is a good overview of the MBTI without getting too in-depth with the 16 personality 'types'. It focuses on the 4 groups of personality types, giving 2 subgroups per type. An interesting introduction into the MBTI personality types, however some prior knowledge of the MBTI might be helpful to facilitate full understanding."
3,Keirsey and personality,"I've thought highly in the past of Keirsey and of Bates. Both show an understanding of how people respond and react, and accurately. This book is a corollary to ""Please Understand Me,"" which is the classic by these authors/researchers."
5,owning it for a year and loving it,"I bought this laminator over a year ago and I have so many uses for it that I thought I owed a review.Some of the great features that I find, apart from doing a great job at laminating, are- My daughters love to take part in the process with no fear of getting burnt- I just use the right amount of plastic each time- I've plastified pics, learning cards (you can actually use white board markers on it, being able to erase it later), multiple crafts and still haven't finished the first roll that came with itMy sister is tired of hearing me talking about it, but I believe she'll end up buying one when she finds a spot to put it."
2,Can't recommend this product,"I have owned this product for several years now, originally bought it based on the good reviews. In all fairness, it has worked ok much of the time. However, I recently went through the ~100 recipes I had laminated over the years, and found that about 1/3 of them were wrinkled- this despite my very careful efforts to feed the paper through evenly. I also agree with the reviewer who said that the refill cartridges are difficult to load- I have loaded 2 of them and it's taken me close to an hour each time, with less-than-perfect results in the end due to misalignment.I recently bought the Scotch thermal laminator and am so far very happy with it. Zero wrinkles so far, and no issues with loading the individual sheets through the machine."
4,Excellent Laminator!,"I've owned this product for many years and have gone through several of the easy to install cartridges. I've also owned heat laminators which use pre-sized pouches for each job. While the finished product of heat lamination is more impressive, I find that the ""soft"" lamination of the 3M system is much better for everyday use. I found that many of the items I laminated were for temporary use, so I couldn't justify the time and money of buying another heat laminator.As for ease of use and reliability, you would be hard pressed to find better."
4,Good product for the price.,"It performs adequately for my use. I am trying to laminate single sheet instructions for my wood working tools and guides, so the instructions do not fade or get lost."
4,blythe's sound,"the personnel: blythe on alto, hamiet bluiett on baritone, kelvin bell on guitar, gust william tsilis on vibraphone and marimba, bob stewart on tuba, arto tuncboyaci on percussion and voice, and famoudou don moye on drums.the majority of the songs are blues based, some bop. avant garde jazz figures in on the song, matter of fact, with blythe and bluiett blowing together.a good example of the blythe sound. substituting for the heavy bass are bob stewart on tuba and tuncboyaci's percussion. to deepen his sound more, blythe, instead of using a pianist on this outing, uses tsilis on vibraphone and marimba. blythe lays down this deep sound and wanders on the ground with his alto.the concluding song, my son ra, a slow tempo solo, resonates richly with much of the songs that have gone before, blythe seems to compose for silence in the way he composes for instruments.more magnetic than hypnotic. though, without a doubt, a hip motion."
4,"If you are shorter, beware!","This chair is excellent quality for the price, for sure, but it's better suited for taller people. I'm 5'4"" and had difficulty getting comfortable until I removed the armrests so I could properly slide under the desk - even then, I can just barely bend my knees properly. The lumbar support isn't adjustable so if you're short, that'll be another issue.Assembly was incredibly easy, but I recommend deciding whether or not you want the armrests before putting it together since the pump handle gets in the way otherwise."
2,not well made,My daughter loves these shoes. The only problem is that the DO NOT last very long. We are on our second pair beause they get a hole in the front after she has worn them only 4 or 5 times. I wish they were better made - I will not be buying any more.
2,Not the Vedas,I bought this book thinking it was the Vedas translated in english. It's bits and pieces put together. It's basically made for a westerner...
5,greek fisherman hat,This greek fisherman hat is just what I was looking for and I got it on time too. Would recomend it to anyone who is looking for this type of hat. Thanks. woodworker20007130@yahoo.com
4,"Nice hat, but NOT a winter version","This is the same Aegean version available from several vendors. Although the picture makes it looks as if the brim is wider than the band, this is NOT the case. (The Scala hat DOES have about a 2-inch wider brim, if that's what you're looking for.) Also, the material is not very heavy (although the hat is well made), and might not be warm enough for winter wear, or heavy rain. (I ended up with 2 of these, from different vendors, and sent them both back when I got the Scala.)"
5,stunning courtroom drama,"Narayan of Rebeccasreads highly recommends ALIBI as Stephen Murphy's first foray into legal fiction. For those who don't recognize his name he the editor of THEIR WORD IS LAW: Bestselling Lawyer-Novelists Talk About Their Craft, & Narayan interviewed him about his book.ALIBI centers around the murder of a local football star of Manchester, New Hampshire. The accused is Raymond Walker, & the evidence against him is nothing but foolproof, he even admits to having threatened McHugh.After topnotch Defense Attorney Dutch Francis agrees to defend Raymond he finds that things are not what they seem -- even Dutch's lifetime friend might be involved in the murder.What follows is courtroom drama at its best -- correctly delineated without antics & histrionics; just pure, incisive courtroom action, as can be expected in real-life -- culminating in a stunning finish."
5,Concise Great Read,"The author has the ability to quickly paint visual pictures. The main character, Dutch, actually instills hope in humanity while also showing his weaknesses. As with all good books I was able to identify with the characters almost as if this could have happened in my home town. Unlike many other mysteries this is a quick read very suitable for a book taken on a vacation. Once I finished the book I found my mind wondering back to situations decribed in the book pondering the events and the intentions of the characters involved. I hope this author has other books coming."
2,Get this cheap,While I admite I'm a compleat Legend of Mana junkie. This game wasn't all that great. It had a few good points. such as needing to use certain weapons to kill off bosses. but Square really didn't care about the fans when they slapped this together. I got it as a gift so I wasn't out anything. but to be honest it's not all that good. if you have to have it get it as cheap as you can. or rent it. you will be much happier trust me.
3,MEH....,"medicore game. Theres nothing special, really repetitive, no replay value AT ALL, very tedious.good note it does take up 17 hours of your time...the artwork is the only thing that you can recognize and relate to from the other games in this series. other than that it really isnt that great. i was hoping something more like legend of mana or secret of mana, butmeh..."
1,EW - Don't Buy,"I was looking forward to this game, but I was bored within a couple of hours. It is VERY repetitive - all you do is hack and slash your way through dungeons. The story is very vague, and the characters have no depth. I'm selling it. Save your money."
2,hack-n-slash,"i bought this game at my local gamestop and the cashier reassured me with a ""good choice!""after playing for a few stages and quests, i discovered that the game is rather repetitive and all you do is hack-n-slash monsters to no end.booooring"
4,This is no Secret of mana but...,"True this is no Scret of Mana but this is set up kinda the same it is very trimmed down, it is a Repetive Dungon Crawler, it dose have a rather good and well done story, it is one of the better ""Mana"" Games released the past few years. No its not Secret of Mana but it dose get closer to SOM's awesome glory.It took me a total of around 20 hours to complete this game and once you do there realy is no replay value except if you want to finnish up a few minor things.Over all this game is fun but it is repetive."
3,"It's no Secret of Mana, but it's fun to play.","Combine the quick, smooth gameplay of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, with the hardly used summons from Mana games. That's pretty much it. Oh, the game is fun, don't get me wrong. Tearing enemies up in real time combat, amplified with gems you can put in your gem-tray that give you awesome abilities, like faster attack speed, life steal, etc. Nice, fast gameplay. Not too fond of holding down the button for a certain length of time to get different spells from the single mana spirit you've equipped.The game is entertaining, not too long, and has a less-than-epic storyline. If you're looking for a fun little hack-n-slash game with enough going for it to keep you playing until the end, this is for you. If you're looking for a mind-encompassing legendary storyline, fire up the old SNES and play Secret of Mana instead.Recommended."
5,The perfect addition to the DS title.,"All I have to say is you must have multiplayer. If you don't it's not nearly as fun. I play this game with my boyfriend and we kinda lost interest after some of the other amazing games and systems that came out recently. We will defintely go back to playing this, leveling and the dungeons are amazing. I really like everything about this game. I just got Sword of Mana also and that game is pretty good but this one took advantage of all of our favorite qualities of the DS system."
3,pretty much a complete and total disappointment,"I bought it mostly feeling nostalgic for Secret of Mana and its sequel, which were both fantastic games, as well as Legend of Mana, which was a very good game.This is neither fantastic nor very good. It's pretty repetitive, not especially fun, and not really easy to recommend. It makes me sigh pretty heavily, if that's an indicator of anything."
3,Really not that good,"I got this because I loved Sword of Mana on the old gameboy. There are many problems with this game but the main problem is that it really is a repetitive dungeon crawl. For example you can get jobs/quests but it sends you back to the same dungeon over and over, to kill all of monster X this time and monster Y this time...in reality you kill all of both each time to get more money anyway, so this is pointless. I was very disappointed with this game, and got rid of it after less than a week."
2,"Horrible for RPG vets. Good for younger, less experienced RPGers","I warily bought this game after having had a bad experience with the last ""Mana"" series game that I played, and, unfortunately, I was rightfully wary. This game is incredibly boring. I tried to give it a chance, but the repetative nature of the dungeons, terribly underdeveloped characters, paper-thin storyline and just all around lack of variety turned me off really quickly. The use of two weapons at once is nice, but not enough to make the game more fun, and the magic system is disappointing and awkward. I think that the game would work well for younger players who are just breaking the ice with RPGs, but anyone who's played and enjoyed an in-depth RPG will be very dissatisfied with this title."
4,Better than I expected,"The reviews for this game seemed low in the publications I had read. I would liken this game to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, in that you play the same stages with different goals. Leveling up is a bit tedious. The story is cute, and light. I enjoyed playing the game very much for the first 10 hours, and couldn't put it down. After that it got a little stale."
5,I Still Feel Good.,"I was actually witnessing hip-hop at it's best when this ode to hip-hop came out in the summer of 1988. Lejuan Love and his freshman lyrics about the things that actually go on in the MIA. I loved the album because at the time, I was living in Miami, so what this young man was rapping about at that time was really true. I would advise any real fan of hip-hop to purchase this album even if you're not from the MIA. It was the dawn of the ages when Luke Skywalker Records was dominating the charts and a little known rapper by the name of Lejuan Love made us move and bop our heads a little harder because what we were listening to, though sometimes gritty, told the story of a place I know well, a place this album put on the map, Liberty City, Florida."
4,Judge a book...???,"I found this disc in a local store and was intrigued by it's beautiful cover ( and how many times have I found wonderful music wrapped in a wonderful cover...)I was not disappointed.Is it world music or is it Jazz..?? or something else again.Oud/saxaphone/double bass and percussion weave in and around the compositions of Rabih Abou-Khalil producing some exotic and uplifting moments,the musicians always complementing each other and the tunes.I look forward to hearing more of his work and I heartily recommend this disc.Perhaps you could describe it as an Arabic version of Shakti.Beautiful...!!"
4,What blends?,Not many words. If you imagine Sahara and floating on the waves of your imaginations then this is the one. If you want to go deeper and explore the spaces then Blue Camel is the one. Definetly the way to cry tearless and to fall a sleep in sweetness.
5,"Please, Sir, I want some more!","If baking soda is ever found to be toxic, I am totally boned. I use it for cleaning my body, hair, teeth, hard household surfaces, laundry (as an add-in), and dishes, and also for de-stanking the cats' litter boxes. The only downside to this product is that it isn't bigger. I've used store-brand baking soda occasionally and I understand that it's the same thing, but the consistency is never the same as A&H. To me, this is exactly the right consistency: fine enough to blend into a recipe or solution but sufficiently abrasive to clean, when used that way. It's even replaced my $xx Philosophy exfoliator and does a better job. Yes, the big box can be a hassle, but I've purchased or re-purposed lots of smaller containers, china saucers and bowls, even silver salt cellars (which it keeps brilliantly un-tarnished) and when repackaged, it looks very exclusive and ""special."" Who needs to know it's pennies an ounce and good for everything from the epidermis to the loo?"
3,Better deal elsewhere,"I love Amazon, but for this particular product, Meijer had 12 2-pound boxes for 16.99 + 7.99 shipping for a net of about 4.16 for 4 pounds."
5,Baking Soda,This item is great. I make my own laundry detergent and it consists of about six items - this is one of them.
5,Good size!,"4 pounds. Good enough to pick up without struggling. I go to the store all the times to buy the mini ones and said I was going to buy it bigger next time. If you have areas around the house where you store it, just buy the bigger size and find small containers ( i used mason jars) to store them in different areas of your house. I use baking soda and water as a facial/back cleanser and it works great!"
4,It's baking soda!,What else would I expect. I needed it for the pool when Christmas stuff took over much of the pool supplies
4,Great product but bad shipping.,It was leaking out baking soda when I received it. But its still a great product and works great as toothpaste mixed with coconut oil.
5,Laminating Film,This is the cold laminating film for the 3M Cold Laminator. When laminating this makes about a standard 3 mil thickness.
1,Sorry I'm not rating it in the STAR category,"One of the most boring books I read this year. Maybe I'm too much a, get to the point"" type of reader. I don't really enjoy, ""what I had for breakfast"" writing."
2,Try Something Else,"The grating might have been fine, but the suction would not work as advertised on my tile countertop. Totally useless for my particular needs."
3,gets the job done,The product has ups and downs...the suction doesn't work after about the 3rd use. The removable plastic tray inside comes in handy! Product is difficut to wash compared to regular graters
4,joyful to use,"We use the hymnal frequently in our Sunday School Class. The words to hymns are great read out loud, there are also prayers and responsive readings which are very useful"
4,An important compendium,"Most of the pieces in this book a pretty hard to dance to, but the lyrics are good."
5,I love college,Describes college life pretty well haha the poster is normal sized and was sent in brand new condition. I love it
1,Don't trust them,The company chose to send me something other than what I ordered. It did not work out for Christmas when my daughter asked for something entirely different. They sent a regular chemistry set.
5,The perfect baby gift,"I've just purchased my sixth copy of this wonderful cookbook to give as a gift to a new mom and dad. The recipes are simple to follow and delicious - not just for babies and toddlers - and the advice is wise and gracious, without being preachy or precious as are so many books for new parents. My ""baby"" is in her twenties now, but some of the recipes have become standby's for me. I regularly treat myself on winter nights to the marvellous split-pea or roasted tomato soups from these pages. You can't go wrong with this one."
2,"ok book, low qulity production","production is pretty low quality, newsprint type paper, no glossy photos like i was hoping. the recipes look OK, i gave it as a gift so won't really know. also it was a little beat up and there were some markings on it, squished cover."
3,Nice watch,This is a nice watch but too big for my wrist. I should have checked the dimensions first.
3,Sing a Song of Chelsea,"Bed, Boys, and Beyond hits all the expected targets as it runs through gay life, predominantly as experienced in the Chelsea of New York City. There are no surprises and it feels somewhat rote on first listening as it moves from comedy to pathos. The singers are pleasant if not overly distinguishable from each other. The score does grow on one, though, as repeated listenings reveal it to be pleasant enough listening, particularly the ballads near the end of the CD. The more humourous songs, such as The (Troll) Magnet, do not stand up well to repeated listenings however. It is, overall, a nice enough CD for a particular audience."
5,Best conditioner for all hair!,"This conditioner is amazing for all hair types especially if you have color damaged hair! Use this for just a couple of weeks and not only will you notice how much better your hair look and feels, but you'll never use another daily conditioner again!"
3,NOT The Best Of Kerastase,"I`m a HUGE fan of Kerastase products. I basically swear by them. But this is not one of their better products. I tried it for something different, but find it to be no more inspiring than most other mid-to-high-end conditioners. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 6.8. It`s ""ok"", but I usually give Kerastase products raving 10`s."
3,Keratase Lait Vital,"I like this product, however, it's not worth the $$.I find Nioxin, for dry & colored hair is just as good."
2,not the best,"Kerastase, Lait Vital Proteine Hair Conditioner is at best okay. I really enjoy Kerastase hair products however I found this conditioner to weight my hair down. It also doesn't leave my hair sliky smooth as other conditioners."
1,Screws too small for pegboard.,"There is indeed a great assortment of hooks, but the screws are necessary to hold them in, they must go on the top as the way the hooks are bent. The screws are about one size to small for pegboard and easily pull out, appear to be 7/32 and need to be at minium 9/32. I have not tried the smaller screws provided for the 1/8"" pegboard. I would avoid these and get the type that do not require screws."
5,Le Davinvi Frame,This was purchased as a gift for my daughter who has expressed delight in recieving it. She has commented that she will be ordering another one.
4,"Awesome Idea, Wish It Was Balanced Better","Dynamic Frames Lil Davinci Art Frames fit in well with our modern decor. I do recommend mounting these frames using the ""Secure Wall Mounting"" method - As the frame becomes unbalanced when opening the cabinet to change the art work if you use the ""Quick Wall Hanging"" method. The downside to this is that it's fixed to either landscape or portrait orientation. Either way be prepared to put two screws into your wall for each frame."
5,FROM BACK COVER,"SPACE GARBAGECommon litter, trash - tossed from a speeding rocket, flash frozen in the void, whipped around the sun and hurtling in orbit - can prove as destructive as a guided missile, and less predictable. So destructive, in fact, that in crowded space traffic, littering may well be the future's worst crime.So Captain Gregory must track down the one survivor of an eleven-year-old space collision to find out just what the Sunflower had jettisoned that might now be returning to Earth as a deadly meteor shower."
4,One of my guilty pleasures,"I'm a middle-aged adult male. Ok, don't laugh I know I'm not the only one that has a few kid's games that they like to play but might be a little embarrassed to say so to their friends. ChoroQ is one of those games for me.ChoroQ is....nah, I can't do it...was about to give a serious review but I am already embarrassed enough. All I'm going to say is I like ChoroQ. There, I've now made a total fool of myself...I hope you're happy."
4,Starts slow but picks up,"Alvin lives with his grandmother and incredibly overprotective mother in Washington DC. He's never so much as been allowed to go on an overnight to a friend's house. When a school project gives him the idea to do some primary research on his hero, Arctic explorer Matthew Henson, he manages to go up into the wilds of Canada and live the adventure of a lifetime.While so many stories of this vein seem to feature obnoxious bratty protagonists, Alvin was incredibly likable in that he was never ugly in that bratty materialistic sort of way. He did his best as an outsider to understand the new culture he was exposed to and rather than sitting around and letting people take care of his every need, he worked hard to pull his own weight.Ms. Napoli's writing and descriptions of the Arctic were wonderful. I'm glad I took a chance on this book."
5,North,"NorthWow, a nail bitter, suspenseful, these are all words that describe the best book since Twilight, North. This book is one of those books you just can't put down. One of my bad qualities is judging books by their covers, and I sure am glad I didn't do that for this book or I would have never read it.It's the classic story of a boy who runs away from home, but there is something about this book that makes it much more intresting. I'm not a big fan of reading but this book I very much enjoyed reading.If you need a good book to read for a long trip or a day at the beach this book is perfect. Or if you're a bit of a slacker like me and you waited to the last minute to choose a book for school and read it, choose this one you will be done with it before you know it,. And the reason is because you just can't put it down. So weather you need a quick read for school or a book for a vacation the book is the book for you."
3,Tensor Replacement Lamps,"Replacement lamps are difficult, but not impossible, to find. Search for CF13SE/865-2G7. This yields a 6500K (color temperature) lamp. If you can live with a warmer color (i.e. 3500K), lamps are cheaper and easier to find. Search for CF13/2G7."
5,Excellent book!,"Great reference book for all bayonet's collectors,with hundred of illustrations and somes interesting notes about every model.Excellent for the novice collector!."
3,Not the same,"This is somewhat the same story as I am used to, however notexactly the same. I like the original version much better than thisversion."
4,The Three Little PIgs,"The book The Three Little Pigs is pretty self explanitory. Its about 3 pigs and there leaving their mom to get homes of their own. But this wolf follows them and tries to get invited into their houses he only wants one thing, but im not gonna tell your gonna have to read it yourself. I think this books teaches a lesson. Dont trust anybody you dont know. I think this book is for older kids between the ages 7 and 8,because little kids MIGHT get scared. I really like this book because its really exciting it s full of adventure, and horror."
5,3 yr old loves this book,"I will agree with the reviewer that states it is odd that the first page shows mom waving the pigs away with a hanky. However, I don't have a reader, so I made up my own version. I tell my son the pigs packed a lunch for a long day out playing. They got cold & decided to build some houses.I really don't want to get into the possibility that they were accepted in college & mommy pig was sad because she was facing an empty nest. Perhaps she was worried about picking up her career where she left off.....Summary: This book does a great job of telling a classic tale in a way that is fun & not scary for small children. The wolf looks silly. Illustrations are very nice. It is my son's current fav"
3,cute but not amazing,I thought this book was okay...the pictures are nice but something about it just didnt make me fall in love with it. It is really hard to find good books of the original story because so many authors choose to change the story around which I hate but to each their own.
4,Daughter loved it.,My daughter loves me to read this book to her. Pictures are cute and enough twist to the fairy tale to make it interesting.
4,Uplifting and Magical! A Modern-Day Fairy Tale,"From the first page to the last, this book turned out to be more than an over-the-summer english assignment. It's Magical! It's creative! It's absolutely wonderful! I am, however, unfamiliar with most of Hoffman's work, and for the first novel I have read by her, it turned out to be a heartfelt favorite. It's the story of a middle-aged women, her son, her son's father whom she is seperated, and an almost mythical stranger. Wonderful for younger teenagers, and people who just want to read an uplifting story."
2,Elementary,"Nothing spectacular about this read. Here on Earth and At Risk is by far this authors finest work. Second Nature is the story of a child raised by wolves and later captured by hunters (original isn't it?). The Wolfman is later indoctrinated to the ways of human beings while constantly longing to return to his family of wolves. After being rescued from a state asylum, the Wolfman is taken in by a mother, separated from her husband, who of course ends up falling in love with the Wolfman and being impregnated with his child. In the midst of this predictable drama are a series of murders of small animals and then of a child in the town (surprise, surprise!). This is a nice story for teenagers and the extreme daydreamer but no real literary value here, in my opinion. The writing is smooth, but everything else about he novel is simply elementary."
4,A surprising look at relationships of all kinds.,"When I began the book about the ""Wolfman"" I was disappointed.As I read on I was enthralled and moved. The ""Wolfman""changes and enriches every life he touches. Alice Hoffmanexplores relationships of every kind: friends, parent-child,sibling, lovers, husband-wife, and more through theirencounters with the story's main characters. I couldn'tput it down once I met them. Take it to the beach!"
4,A modern day fairy tale...,"I simply loved this book! Of course, it was a highly unbelieveable story. I think that is the magic of the book. It draws you in so quickly that by the time you are finished reading the last page, you are breathless. I read the book in only two days because I wanted to know what would happen to the ""wolf boy"". Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the last few pages of the novel. I felt there was too much left to wonder. However, I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a sweet, simple jolt on what it means to be human and to love."
3,A fine treatment of a wolf-man.,"A divorcee rescues a wolf-man, raised by wolves, from a mental institution. Once you accept the premise, the wolf-man is done very well, with feeling, but without sentimentality. Hoffman too often settles for the facile in her plot and character development for this to be a genuinely good book, nor by design, is it charming like some other Hoffman books, but it is a very decent read."
2,Not one of his better books,It is hard to keep up with Robin Cook because he publishes books so quickly. I decided to do myself a favor and catch up on his old books before I read his new ones. I think I could've lived without this one. Some of the situations were a bit hokie as well as some of the dialog. I think he could've improved on this book.
2,Boring and predictable,Usually I really enjoy books by Robin Cook. But this one was pretty boring and predictable.Right of the bat it's quite clear who is the killer. Also the parts where the Cassy character is described are often so boring and slow that I fast-read through those alltogether.
1,Not so great,"I usually enjoy robin cook's books. This one was a disappointment. it was predictable, slow, not worth the time. Save the read for one of his better books!"
5,Robin Cook rocks,"Robin Cook's book Godplayer kept me up until I read the whole thing. Of course I just got out of the hospital, so it was scary, but great!"
3,just ok,"this was an easy read, really grabs your attention right away. the dialogue is engaging and the characters are relatable. the plot was a little predictable unfortunately, and the ending is VERY abrupt and not very thrilling. this is the first novel Ive read by Cook, though, and I will say it made me want to try a few more of his books."
1,Boring... Boring...Boring......,"Wow.. can this book get anymore boring.. I usually enjoy reading books by Robin Cook.. but what was this??? The only time I read it was when I was going to sleep, so that it would help me sleep. If your interested in reading books by Robin Cook don't start with this one. :)"
2,Robin Cook NOT AT HIS BEST,"Like many other Cook fans, I found this book to be extremely slow paced and rather boring. I kept hoping that it would click and the high energy fast paced excitement that you expreience with most Cook novels would kick in. It never did. If this were anyone other then Dr. Cook I probably would have returned it to the library without completing it.Sorry folks, if you like Robin Cook don't expect his usual good stuff. If you've never read Cook, don't start with this one."
3,Just to have fun,"Let me tell you that you'll read this book in no-time. But the end of the book is worthless, I think that the last pages RC said to his child to finish the book and he finished at his will. In the book are many loose ends that when you're reading the book seems important, but when you finish the book and you see that those stories never ended you'll be disappointed. I won't give you here these examples just in case you want to read the book. As always with all RC's books you'll think twice before going to an hospital.Despite all of the above, you'll have a good time reading this book but don't expect an excellent end. Thinking better, don't expect anything at the book's end (the last two chapters and the epilogue.)"
5,Godplayer: Cardio-Horrer,"Godplayer, by Robin Cook, is a whole new ball-park in medical mysteries. This book explores th dark side of Cardiology, the study of the heart. I enjoyed this one a lot, it is a new and unique book by the leading author of medical thrillers!"
2,In one word: predictable.,"Robin Cook is undoubtedly one of the best writers in medical thrillers. Yet Godplayer was below his normal standard. During the first few pages, a reasonable understanding of the plot could be figured out. The name of the novel itself acted as a major clue. The character of Thomas Kingsley appeared as the stereotypical mad scientist/doctor who was overwhelmed by his own power. Its sole saving grace was the fact that it addressed the issue of doctors needing to decide who should live or die."
1,AHHHH avoid this one like the plague....,"Well I love Robin Cook....usualy. But this one realy is BAD!!! It takes you only 2/3 of the book to get any where. This one drags like broken muffler. I will not say to not get this book, but if you like fast paced books, don't pick this one. If you are a doctor you may like it."
2,Great looking bag; not durable,"This IS a beautiful bag, but what good is the beauty if it's falling apart?! I have used this bag for 5 months and the snap closure is coming off, the strap is fraying and coming apart and the changing pad that came with the bag frayed and had to be thrown out after only a month!Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed, given the price of the bag. I falsely assumed this would be a durable bag that would last until I no longer needed a diaper bag.I'm going back to my ""Little Tripper"" bag from Land's End. I've had that one since baby #1 (I'm on #3) and it's still in great condition!"
2,Beautiful Bag--poor quality materials,"I hate to give this bag a bad review as it is beautiful and I have received many compliments on it, but it is literally falling apart. I have used it frequently for 7 months and in that time the zipper on the back that holds the backpack straps has broken, the main zipper sticks, the inner pocket lining is totally shredded (i even thought I lost something because it fell into the ""inside"" of the bag), and now one of the backpack straps has come apart from the bag. I wanted to use it mainly for the backpack function and now I can't so its a basic diaper bag again. I wouldn't waste your money. If you want a quality diaper bag that can also be use as a backpack I would buy one made of sturdier materials."
5,It should have lasted longer.,"I have all three volumes and loved it when it was on tv on Saturday morning. Being that they are bugs, the two flies have a bit of raunchy humor. It's no Simpsons but still fun to watch."
1,Appeared to be used and abused,"The screen, with new batteries in it, doesn't display properly, not enough to even play the game. The sound was weak, barely audible and sounded as if it were skipping, like a scratched vinyl record. I replaced the batteries several times to be they weren't the cause. The body plastic of the game itself was scratched with some of the paint worn off, EX: Cookie Monster and Big Bird had white eyes, black dots were worn off. The packaging was also pretty beat up, unlike the photograph. I'm very glad I checked it over completely before giving it as a gift.For $8, I should have expected imperfection, but not to this extent, not worth the effort to return. I purchased two items from this vendor, the second was perfect, but I won't purchase from this seller again."
2,nice story but that's all,"After reading Hobb and Rothfuss (probably that's my problem) this book is a nice story, but not more. I could get halfway trough the first book and that's it, the characters mostly stayed paper figures and did not come alive to me, mainly because after every dialogue the writer describes what the characters are thinking, what they are going to do (mostly not from the characters point of view and worst of all: the writer knows more then they do, that is logical) but i don't want to know that they took a wrong direction somewhere underground while i am in the middle of reading it, all of a sudden that kind of remarks bring me back to the couch with a book / Kindle in my hand. Back to reality. I's very distracting."
3,a good beginning,"The second and third books in this trilogy are much better than the first and as a set are an excellent fantasy. I am glad I went ahead and read the second because of the Kindle editions' affordability. I read the first in trade paperback and while it was good it wasn't good enough to buy the others. Now that I have read all three on Kindle I plan to complete the 'real' set as well.So give this one a try and if you find, like me, that it's a good story but you wish the writing had been better, I assure you that it does get much better with the other two books. C.S. Marks obviously learned from her first book, and is an excellent writer now. Don't skip over this book, though, or you'll miss out on some very good ideas and needed backstory.All in all I say 'Well done! and Thank you for writing this fine epic tale.'"
5,Wonderful Traditional Fantasy,"Elfhunter is a fantastic traditional fantasy! It has all of the elements that one would seek in fantasy/adventure book. C.S. Marks has created a set of characters that you enjoy becoming invested in. I would compare her method of character development to the act of getting to know someone on the journey. You don't get a huge info dump ever time a new character is introduced, you get to know them the same way you would if you were meeting them in person.Alterra is a wonderful world, I like that it is so organic. There isn't a lot of ""magic"", while there is some it's not overdone. If you are looking for a magi-heavy world this isn't it.The parallels drawn between the heroine and the villain of the story are well crafted and believable. I actually managed to feel a little sorry for Gorgon Elfhunter!I definitely recommend this book, and will be keeping an eye out for the next in the installment."
4,An Epic Quest,"The narrative story telling, at the beginning, was slow for me to get into at first; but the author had a world to set up and players to introduce. This is an intricate tale of an epic fantasy with a richly detailed plot, which grows into a quest.The characters are solid and well rounded with personalities that you will come to love. Gaelen is a strong driven female elf who drives the quest. Orogond is the human ranger with heart. Fima is the dwarf lore master who has the wisdom and knowledge they need. Gorgon is the elfhunter, but he does not discriminate, he kills all.Wonderful story telling, I was completely drawn into Alterra and I can't wait to see what happens next. There is not truly a cliffhanger at the end but the quest will continue. I would recommend.The editing was flawless. The only thing that I would have liked to have seen was some spacing between the chapters, and that is probably just a personal preference. :)"
2,Bad Elf,"This book is a poor ripoff of Tolkien. The world that has been created is very much the same as Middle Earth, as is the villain of the piece, allwithout the great writing of Tolkien."
2,"Too ""Girly""","This is a cross between Fantasy and Romance. Love? You bet! Unrequited? Sure, just over there. Doomed? Grab a hankie and head over there and there and there. If only Fabio was an elf.That said, it is a heck of a premise. I got engrossed by fantasy side only to see it switch genres again and again. I'd love to see a rewrite. It is an excellent bit of fantasy when that is allowed out. But for me, all the rest just bogged it down.The world she created is an interesting one. The characters are interesting. This would have really drawn me to the author. Others might find her romance side as equally attractive. But, the mix lost me as a reader."
2,Very Slow Going!,I tried to get into this book because of all the rave reviews. It just seemed to be a painful slow journey the writing does not resemble Tolkien to me. But that is my opinion.
1,Not all that good,Got about halfway through the book and lost interest. There's so much detail it gets confusing and boring a times
2,Lost in the Cliches,"Elfhunter: A Tale Of Alterra, The World That Is (Tales of Alterra, the World that Is.)I managed about half of this book before the cliché police smacked me out of the book. If I could have managed to read the book as a satire, I might have gotten past the 'fine up right and honorable' heroes. Toss in the issue that after 2-3 weeks on the trail together, there is little you have not assessed about your traveling partners and you do know the strengths and weaknesses of your camp-mates.The characters were cardboard cutouts in my world. I will pass it to my son to see what he thinks."
5,Great book but difficult to keep names and places straight.,"I bought this book from my grandmother's Kindle when she was letting me test drive it to see if I wanted one of my own. This book caught my eye because it was a fantasy book which is my favorite type of book, and it was only $0.99! In the beginnning I had a hard time getting through the names because I do not like to read names that I can not pronounce. However once I got into the book the names did not matter anymore. This was a great book filled with love, loyalty, bravery, determination, and vengence. I felt like I could get close to the characters and get to understand their different sides of the story. One thing that confused me was keeping names and places straight, especially since I could not pronounce tham correctly and kept changing how I read them. I believe that this is a great story for all ages and is the story that got me hooked on the Kindle. I would definatly recommend this book to anyone with a love of fantasy."
5,Captivating!,"This tale of Alterra, the World That Is, is truly captivating! The eloquence with which C.S. Marks writes is extraordinary. Her works have been compared to Tolkien, and rightly so. Her writing style is similar to his, but her story is all her own. Her characters are so well done that you can't help but feel as if you know them. You feel their pains, revel in their joys and share the burden of their sadness. Their journeys, both physical and emotional, are so enthralling. It is very hard to put the book down! Highly recommended and a must read!"
2,Good and difficult - both!,"I like the over all story, but it is way too long and becomes overly violent. I have read similar books that tell of the violence without the feeling of ""panting after more & more""."
5,In the tradition of J.R.R. Tolkien ...,"C.S. Marks has created a wonderful fantasy world with powerful and likeable characters as well as an overwhelmingly horrific villian. Although the story took a couple of chapters to grab you by the seat of your pants and pull you in - after it did it was impossible to stop reading. I am well into the third book (Ravenshade) and the story, characters and world just keep getting better and better. So well worth the time to pick up and read.Well done Ms. Marks!"
1,Painful,"If you are under the age of 10, this might be seen as an okay, but very mediocre, book. However, those of us older and wiser will recognize the cliched plot of stock fantasy characters beaten over the head with a thesaurus a few times. The story follows Gaelen and Nelwyn, a pair of hunter-scouts who live in Dominglas forest. There are also humans involved, one of whom naturally comes in with a plan to save the day but they cannot hide the fact that 'Elfhunter' is a complete ripoff. Marks seems to feel no need to flesh out characters beyond tired stereotypes: the beauiful elves, the humans, the evil foe trying to get them. The characters remain one dimensional cutouts of their stereotypes with no personality or redeeming characteristics.All in all, I hated Elfhunter. This book is extremely boring and not original. It is copied off better books. I predicted every bit of it. One might even go so far as to call it plagarism. Save your money and buy a decent, original book."
1,Don't waste your money,"This product will do nothing for the 2003-2005 Accord. I ran this spacer on my Accord for almost two years. During that time, I raced the car in autocross events. There was no noticeable increase in torque or horsepower. The only noticeable change resulting from this spacer was a hissing sound at partial throttle. The sound was caused by the grooves on the inside of the spacer. Needless to say, I took the spacer off the car and noticed no decrease in performance. The $100 spent on this would be much better spent on a cold air or short ram intake.As a closing comment, throttle body spacers CAN be beneficial in certain engine setups. This is especially true with V8 engines or those with certain air intake configurations. For the 7th gen (2003-2007) Accord, you will not benefit from this spacer."
4,Cool little device,"Works just as advertised, but requires a bit more light than just sticking it on the outside of the light cover. By tucking it under the cover you get a nice bright blinking dot. No batteries, no outlet, no transformer brick."
2,Good design idea--poor execution,"Sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct doesn't work--the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work. I was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit--you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener. Also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module, it doesn't hold it in rotational position."
5,Perfect parking in tight spots,The laser parking system works great! It took me 5 minutes to install and now my wife can park her way oversized SUV in our garage with little problem. No kidding there is 1 inch to spare in the front before she hits the shelves and 3 inches in the back so the garage door can close. With the laser she hits the mark everytime.
3,Garage parking,Product shipped quickly and was as described.Simple to install in 2-3 minutes.The only issue I have had is that the adhesive to stick unit to garage opener will not stay attached.had to put velcro on to make it happen-better adhesive manufacturer!!
5,Most complete to date,"As a past student of Dr. Van Roosmalen I am biast to his accomplishes. However, the fact that this is the most complete and informative book on the specified subject can't be denied. Short yet informative descriptions, easily referenced in its taxonomic arrangement, and the illustrations by Betsy Van Roosmalen complete this comprehensive resource."
2,OK,For some reason this device did not work anywhere near as well as the original Dr. Scholls I had. Unlucky????
5,Great,Easy to setup and very efficient. A child could set this up and use it immediately. Easily cleaned and very portable.
5,Buy one if you can find one!,"I have been through many many storms in this tent and it has held up like a champ. not one drop of water has ever entered the tent. very light weight and sets up in literally about 4 minutes.My favorite feature is the vented rainfly. It does a great job of preventing humidity from building up inside the tent.I believe this tent is no longer manufactured. But if you can find it, buy it!"
3,LOOK OUT,"I am a Peter Mulvey fan who is looking to replace this CD - it got lost somewhere in the abyss. THE SONGS THAT I AM SAMPLING HERE ARE NOT PETER MULVEY. Check what you are listening to with other CD's that you are confident are him singing. I am listening to the sample songs and they are not only not the right songs, tehy don't even sound like him. CHECK IT OUT BEFORE YOU BUY. I think there must have been a technical error on behalf of Amazon (sorry - never had any other complaints)."
3,Virtuosity meets self indulgence,"I ordered three Peter Mulvey tapes at one time in a fit of enthusiasm which I regretted a bit once I had listened to the complete CDs.First the pluses: Mulvey is a guitar virtuoso with a very pleasing baritone - he is an accomplished musician and, as in the title track, one heck of a songwriter when he wants to be.My problem is that so many of the songs are melodically over complex or veering towards a kind of free jazz indulgence that wears on you real quick. You get the feeling that he is half recording stuff for his own eclectic enjoyment rather than thinking about how they might be received among the great public out there.hat's too bad because at his best on tracks like Abilene, Lila Blue and the title track, he is 5 stars all the way, but then you have to grit your teeth through all these overwrought, borderline ""atonal"" numbers, hence, sadly, the three stars."
5,This book has a thought-provoking edge!,"This author does not shy away from the use of raw language and racial slurs, and the result gives his work a thought-provoking edge. For those who didn't live through this phenomenal decade of change, it offers a better understanding of how far we have progressed."
3,"Nice, but I was hoping to have more Latin Mass songs","This CD had at least 2 songs I can hear in a Latin Mass... but very stylized.I was hoping to have more Latin Mass songs. Hard to find Latin Mass songs in a gregorian chant method.This choir is OK, but the songs are stylized to the point that I cannot make out the melody.It sounds good... but I am lost is recognizing the song. Also, the organ is small for the ""cathedral"" sound. Oh well, on with the search..."
5,60's and the Latin Mass,I am one of those 60s people. We did not throw out the Latin mass. Why would we? We liked it. I served most of the high masses of the holidays. It was a small cabal of newly ordained priests and bishops in the Vatican II committees who threw it out. They wanted to be more like their Protestant bretheren; have the congregation face them instead of God. Read the book MISSING MARY while you are listening to this CD. They threw her out at the same time; no women in high places - their answer to the feminists of the 60s.
5,It is amazing!!!,"I am very happy with my purchase. This item is better than what I was expecting. It was amazing how fast I received my order, I highly recommend it and hope that more people order it."
2,Latinlover,"As a devoted lover of Catholic Latin hymns, I was disappointed at the enemic presentation of these beautiful hymns to God. I believe that the singers had the best of intentions but I would suggest to look for other versions of these wonderful songs to heaven."
5,at last,"Are you sick of the dysharmonic, unsingable, unmemorable tripe that masquerades as sacred music during Mass these days? If so, this collection of Latin hymns is your antidote. As one of my sisters said ""you can see and smell the incense as 'Tantum Ergo' plays""."
4,majestic,"if you remember the latin mass, and the sometimes inspired high masses of the pre vatican II era, this is for you. an inspired collection of hymns, most are featured in the St Gregrory hymnal. well arranged, with excellent singing and conducting. buy it!"
2,Junkyard Dog,"once katie sees the shinny brown dog in a junkyard.All she canthink about is taking him home.But the dog doesnt belong to her ,andeven if it did her parents would never let her keep it becauce dogs arent allowed in the her house.Her mom and step dad said that she could keep him if she can feed it pay for it and if the junkyard man lets you.So, she ran to the junkyard and there was the junkyard man.She asked him if shae could have tha do and the man said if you take better care of him then i can sure.So she takes him home.She has a great time with her new dog which she named Lucky.But one day it started to snow and and she need to make something for him to live in for the winter.Katie was his only hope."
2,Not for Ink jet printers,"I purchased this to create a transfer for a photo to canvas. When the printer put the ink on the transfer, it was nothing like the picture, the ink pooled together and it was a mess. I looked at several different transparencies and thought this one said ink jet, but now I see it is not listed."
5,Perfect,"We use these to create product templates to ensure the parts are within a minimum spec size. They hold their tolerance very nice and are easy to use in the printer. Never a jam, just nice clean copies."
1,not the same as the salon,"compared to the salon product, there was less foaming and cleaning. would have to shampoo again. hair felt weighed down. would not buy from amazon again."
1,Watch out!!,"I bought this shampoo from ""ezee llc"" which now seems to have the name ""lindasproperties"" and it was NOT the correct product that I have been using from Bumble and Bumble for years. It did not smell like the original product at all and it had a different color and texture to it. I returned it right away and now I just order it from Bumble and Bumble directly - they always have deals on their site and often have free shipping, so it's probably worth it to know you are getting the correct product and that it hasn't been tampered with."
3,Not as good as most B&B products,"Ive used B&B; for over 5 years now and normally would rate them 4 to 5 stars, this product tho is a 3 star. Its ok but I cant use it every day.I was previously using Crew for Men tea tree shampoo and had excellent results but cant seem to find it anymore. This product seems to really dry my hair and doesnt have the slight tingle ive come to expect from tea tree type shampoos. It also has a pronounced medicinal odor-not the pleasant tea tree oil odor but kind of like a cheap hospital product. After my wife remarked on the odor i decided to look elsewhere. Too bad really because both of us use and like other B&B; products."
2,OK,"Love my other B&B products (Sunday shampoo and Coco shampoo/conditioner), but for the price I don't find much to rave about with this product. Slight scent is OK, but don't feel any real tonic action--very little if any tingling or refreshing feeling as described by other reviewers. Cleans ok though. Maybe just me, but was disappointed with this purchase otherwise."
5,A TIGER WITH A VELVET PAW,"Colin Brooks' ""Chippin Away at the Promised Land"" demonstrates all the reasons why he was an integral part of the Band of Heathens and why his departure leaves the group facing the prospect of narrowing its eclectic range.Brooks sings softly on nearly all the cuts, leaving the heavy lifting for his musicianship and that of his sidemen. There are aching moments of longing (""Cool Water"", ""Drive Me Home""), rollicking rock (""Mexico""), down and dirty blues (""Sugar"") and even a dose of New York jazz (""Nobody""). Add to that mix one of the most moving covers of Dylan's ""Lay Lady Lay"" and you come away with the feeling that this man can write about anything and play guitar as well as anyone.And you would not be wrong."
4,This book is a hoot!,"This is a really fun read for anyone interested in the early days of newspaper journalism. Banks was a self-styled 19th century ""stunt journalist,"" taking on menial jobs for the sake of writing about the lives of the oppressed classes, often with hilarious results as she stumbles her way through Victorian London society as a clueless American."
1,Not as good as it looked,"Although a cursory look at the contents look comprehensive, a close look at the chapters are disappointingI know lots of scientist friends that devote their life studying LBP & pain generators like Dr PanjarbiIn the section on pain generators in this book,instead of giving a good description of spinal segmental innervation, the works of Panjarbi etc, the author seemed to suggest that many previous writings & literature on this important aspect of LBP are 'conjectures at best' - thoughdowngrading the hard works of others, the same author cannotgive a good discussion of pain generators himselfThere is a hint there is inadequate respect of otherpeople's work over the decades. Extremely disappointing attitude"
5,"great songs excellent singing, not 1trk all are good","this cd is full of good songs, great singing, and playing. the singer sounds like phill collins and peter gabriel with his own original flavour."
4,Useful Pocket Map for New Orleans,"Lonely Planet puts out a decent plastic covered ""pocket"" map of New Orleans. It has the street car stops on the map as well as a street index. I was disappointed it did not have an interesting sights or Hotel index but each of those are listed on the map itself. The French Quarter section is quite detailed. The surrounding area of New Orleans is a bit spotty. Created in 2001 so its fairly recent and up to date."
2,Couldn't even finish it.....,I read tons of books and I just couldn't get through this one. The plot was not interesting and the characters were weak. Not a good read.
3,A little disapointed,This item breathes well and has plenty of room to carry all your items. It does not stay tight around your waist however making it uncomfortable to wear.
1,Wrong Product,"I did not receive the product that was advertised. The package showed a belt-style Eagle Creek Passport case, but when I opened it up, inside was a passport case that hangs around the neck."
1,Why contemporary Catholic music is so terrible,"As a singer I'm usually a fan of Marty Haugen but this is barely recognizable as his work. Worse, it has all the elements of the typical folk-rock Mass inflicted on so many parishes -- a genre whose day has long since come and gone. Instrumentals are so boring they're almost invisible, hyper-repetitive melodies and vocalists who are frequently off-key. Sound like Sunday morning in your church? Haugen is one of the few composers (with John Schiavone) whose Masses and Psalm settings aren't totally pedestrian. This, however, is a perfect example of exactly how thoroughly the Catholic Church has abandoned a thousand years of beautiful music."
3,a good album to relax with,"I am a long time Phil Keaggy fan. I very much look forward to any new release from him. This one was especially anticipated because it was a vocal album, after many instrumental albums. (Don't get me wrong, his guitar is without peer, but he does also have a very expressive voice). After listening about 10 times through, I have to say that there is no song, or group of songs that really jump out at me. Most of the songs are fine, and I have no problems with any of the album, I guess that after releasing such excellent albums as ""Phil Keaggy"" and ""Way Back Home"", he raised the bar so high, that it is difficult to keep meeting his own high standards. A very pleasant listen, Phil's voice and guitar still sound wonderful, but not quite up to the level of his other five star releases. Who knows though? Maybe with another 10 listens, I'll be really hooked."
2,snagged,"These socks cost too much for the quality-and I soooo wanted to love them. They are really soft and fit the foot well, but the tops snag too easily"
3,Like a parson's egg - good in places.,"I'm truly torn as to how to review this book. On one hand it created a sweeping sense of time and place, on the other, it felt like an author's first book. Take as an example the character of Lily - was it just me that felt hugely uncomfortable with the total change of character from total whinge and paranoi about disease, to happy earth mother digging vegetable gardens in near poverty? And poor Matty, the hardships and loss of people she loved almost became farcical in their regularity - I found myself willing characters to stay away from her because it would only end in tears and since, in the prologue, Matty was very much alive, it was clear it wouldnt be her death.In short, a good read, but not a brilliant one. If this is the author's first book then some of the glitches are forgiveable...if not, then this author just isnt for me."
4,Fantastic Work,"The beauty of this book...the author, though angry, uses the angry energy in a focused, forthright and definitive way. The result is an informative and detailed look at history that most may be surprised to read. Jennings analysis of the events is told in a story-like form, so that the reader is enlightened, then slowly taken in by the intrigue and intriging mischief of the day. Another title for this research could have been {the art of puritan warfare}. The author tells of the barbaric, imperialistic, and destructive engagements with the Irish as a prelude to the western invasion. This invasive group of people had plenty of practice. Word of advice, read slowly, don't miss anything...Fantastic Work..."
2,meh,"MUCH more a documentary of the ""author"" of the book than a dramatization or ""docu-drama"" of the midwife.VERY meh"
3,Works fairly well,"I bought this device in order to cut copper plates for my photography. I find it difficult to get a nice, square cut but it gets better with practice.The particular product that I received from Amazon's partner, Hamilton, was packed in thin styrofoam that had all but disintegrated by the time the shipping carton reached me. Combined with the fact that the handle had writing ALL OVER IT in permanent marker (including a $99 price tag), I don't think that I'll be ordering from this group of yahoos again."
4,"""Hooked"" on this..",These are great for keeping the back seat uncluttered! I bought two one for each headrest and have had many of compliments on them. When I have passengers ride in the back seat they love that they can hang their purse instead of sitting it in the floorboard or holding it. I like that my umbrella and window sunscreen is easily accessible as I have them hanging from one of the hooks. I highly recommend these - great for the price!
4,car hook,"I put this hook in my van right away and it works great so far (it's been a week) It arrived within a week , it looks very sturdy and I have put 4 bags on it and it seems fine."
2,Not big enough hooks,"The hooks were just too small for hanging my purse -- which was my primary objective. Would probably be okay for store plastic bags, but I took these off and replaced with the Talus High Road Car Hooks, also thru amazon.com. Since I have light colored leather car seats, I just hope the metal Talus hooks don't make a rubbing mark. That was the reason I chose these plastic ones first. Also the nice thing about the Talus ones are that the hook is deeper and bendable so that you can stretch the hook out to accommodate a big handled purse, etc."
1,Important questiones unansewred.,"Very basic information at best. Not really much help if you are seriously thinking of growing your own grapes. Many questions, like what variety should I grow, in not addressed properly as far as a Merlot or Cabernet etc. In fact the word ""Merlot"" is not even in the book! How far apart should the vines be planted? Beats me! I guess I'll have to look in another book."
5,Wine and Cuisine,"This is the definitive book for growing, fertilization and vineyard care for American Vines. Any questions you have this little book will answer them. J Loenholdt talks in a language that all can understand........"
2,Logo messed the whole idea up,"My husband had seen a video of a fireplace in his Doctors office and thought it was great, so I went online to find one. This video seemed to have good ratings so it is the one we purchased. However, what no one had mentioned was that when you play the fireplace it has a logo on the entire run, in the bottom right hand corner, of MD. It messes up the whole DVD. I am really surprised that someone would shoot a video of a fireplace and then put a logo on it. I am very disappointed in it."
1,You must be kidding,"I regret this purchase. It is essentially, three different shots of what seems to be the same fire. The only difference is the first shot has about 4 logs, the second has about 2 and the third has 1. There is also a logo awkwardly placed in the lower right of the screen. I am greatly unimpressed!"
1,Terrible Quality - Don't Download,"The video quality here is unacceptable and, as others have mentioned, the sound is totally sub par. When the fireplace crackles, black lines flicker through the video; the publisher watermarked the fireplace with 'MD' on the lower right; and the dark areas are totally boxy and over-compressed. In short, I prefer the free YouTube clips in HD to this crap. Don't waste your money."
1,Low Quality,"The video and audio are both low quality. It's as though some person built a fire in their residence, set up a camcorder on a tripod to film it burning to fruition using the low quality mic built into the camcorder."
4,Not bad considering the novelty of it all.,"My six year old son kept asking if he could blow out the fire and just for entertainment value, it's worth half the price of pausing the video every time he blows on the screen. I'm just glad that he didn't go fetch a bucket of water right on to the flat panel.But on the serious side, it was nice to have it ""roaring"" in the background while I was reading a book. It even helped me fall asleep."
4,Fun,"Love the video, especially the option that shows the fire burning down over time. The only minor draw back is the audio that occasionally has traffic noise in the background."
2,burn that sucka,picture is good but the mic was held WAY to close to fireplace..when i turned it on i had to check and make sure my house wasnt on fire. even turning the volume down dosent really work because you hear to much detail in it..for 8 bucks its ok almost gave it 3 stars
4,digital fireplace,GREAT AS A BACKDROP TO A PARTY OR JUST TO SIT AND RELAX AND LISTEN TO THE CRACKLE AND POP. I NOW LIVE IN FLORIDA AND AS A FORMER NEWENGLANDER ITS NICE TO STILL HAVE MY FIRE - GREAT
5,Our fireplace on TV,"This is an excellent product. We have used it with a party of 30 people present and all were very positively impressed. We all were amazed when the ash fell off the logs and the sound was present just as it would have been in a real fireplace.One problem. Do not use the 'digital fireplace' to an extreme as we have discovered the bright flame will, in time, negatively affect the screen of the TV."
1,Dont get burned...,"The creator placed a video camera in front of a burning fireplace, but didn't bother to edit background noises like traffic - trucks - carsPretty much killed the ambiance which was the point of the purchase of the video...Save your money"
4,A good COOK book,"I bought this book many years ago and still use it today. The recipes are good, I haven't had a bad experience yet. If you're looking to this book as your only source of magical information, you might want to cross reference with other books."
2,Mixing It Up,"I found this book somewhat disappointing. The dialog and ideas are great, but the time-saving elements and actual recipes were not much beyond ""soup can cooking."" I'm no chef by any means, but there were far too many ""shortcuts"" for my tastes (if you'll excuse the expression) and, thus, limited its efficacy. I'd think a kitchenwitch would do more from scratch."
3,Amusing reading,"This is an interesting cookbook that I have enjoyed a bit. Recipes are to reflect certain things you want to happen. I can not speak for the validity of these recipies, but I can tell you that many do taste pretty good. Book is easy to follow and the recipes are very concise."
3,"Limited, but a good place to start.","To be honest, I have a problem with Llewellyn Publications, yet I still buy them from time to time because with all the chaft you're bound to find some wheat sooner or later, right? This is one of the few that I bought without a feeling of dread. Simply put, it's a collection of suggested recipes together with an assortment of common magical associations for food and general ingredients. I've found that it is a useful book for planning a meal for a ritual or Sabbath, but perhaps more for the themes from the suggested recipes rather than from the recipes themselves. Over all, it's at least a fairly good cookbook with useful suggestions. One warning: The recipes do tend to be on the Yuppie-fied side, so if you absolutely have to follow the book, be sure to bring your checkbook."
3,These Recepies Barely Warmed My Oven!,"This book gets right down to business. From the Introduction I was ready to cook.But found most recepies very unpractical for an everyday menu.I don't plan on using it all the time. If you're a parent with kids,this book may not fit your busy schedule.A good income is a plus.Apart from the recepies I found how to make my kitchen a truly magickal place! Not a book I should have bought, instead would have rather borrowed it.But it may be the book for you."
4,Navy blue is not black!,"This is a nice looking watch but the band color is navy blue and not black as stated. This was most obvious when I compared it to my old watch with a black band. In various lighting conditions however, it's really hard to tell that much difference so since I like Hamilton and navy blue, I kept the watch.Everything else was fine with my transaction and the price was certainly right too for a nice watch."
5,I LOVE this book,I love this book. I found it several years ago in a book bin at a local drug store. I don't even remember why I purchased it. It took me to a time and place in history that I didn't know existed for Black Americans. I have read it over and over again.
5,EXCELLENT!!!!,"I loved this book, although it was a bit too long. I really enjoyed it and I thought it was worth the extra pages. I also learned a few things reading this book. I wish there were more historical authors out there besides Patricia Vaughn and Beverly Jenkins."
2,Deceiving,"When I first read the comments about the book I was thoroughly excited and decided to purchase it. However, once I started reading, I must say it was deceiving. It was awful and the plot was too long! The writer could have done more research about the subject and made the plot shorter. I would not recommend this book and I wish I had not purchased it."
3,Immensely grateful but waiting for the next,"As an antidote to my seams-bursting curiosity about Cornell, this book deserves a rating off the measly 5 star scale and into the realm of splendiferous constellations. To you Deborah Solomon I am sincerely grateful. But upon rereading Utopia Parkway seems rather thin, and at times, unfortunately, nearly patronizing. I don't doubt her respect for Cornell, but occasionally she treats him as too much of a curiosity, as if he was an eccentric she's putting into a box. Perhaps she simply had trouble understanding him. And of course she committed the unpardonable sin, and anti-Cornellian faux pas, within her pages of referring to pigeons as ugly grey scavengers. They are, as every reader of this book should know, winged urban enchanters."
3,why the psychobable?,"like all the other reviewers i have an immense interest in cornell. however i found deborah solomon's constant psychological asides both banal and ultimately dulling. every page has some fatuous and often risible so-called apercu. i wanted a biography, not some fanciful and very dated exercise in psychoanalysis. shame cos there is a lot of enjoyable fact offered. cornell's own selected diary and letters published under the title The Theatre of the Mind, is the only authority on his thinking as far as i am concerned. this biographical arrogance of reducing an artist's life to a sequence of supposedly transparent motivations is so passe surely."
2,"Joseph Cornell, you deserve better!","Being a recent initiate into the brilliance of Joseph Cornell's work, It was with baited breath that I waited by my mailbox for this book to arrive. Finally, it was delivered- such a pretty cover! Such a marvelous title!- and then- oh dear. Here you have a very nice-looking academic woman prattling off a list of things having to do with some guy named Joseph Cornell; basically, making boring and dull that which is infinitely fascinating.This book feels like an assignment from an editor. Or worse- a square book from a well-meaning writer who hasn't learned that writing good biography takes obsessive love.If you are an imaginative person with a couple of afternoons on hand, please read this book for the sheer informational content and supply your own poetry."
5,A great book. Norwegian Heritage not required.,"This is a wonderful book. The author has cooked up a book of food and recipes from Norway that is very personal and beautiful. The recipes are a superb selection that vary from traditional fish recipes that are as old as Odin and the Norwegian Sea to recent introductions of culinary delights and the twists that trade has conjured in modern Norwegian kitchens. The book is not just a list of recipes, and this is what sets this book apart. The author has given background information about the recipes and includes quite a bit of history and personal stories that bring the reader right into Andreas Viestad's kitchen. The photography by Mette Randem is amazingly beautiful, giving the book an added experience to the reader/cook. To be short, this is the book you are looking for if you are reading this sentence."
3,Not exactly what I needed,"I make hand-crafted cards and invitations, and had hoped to use these for window cards. While they are ok, they are not completely clear but just a little cloudy. I have not tried running it through the inkjet printer at all so perhaps that would help with the cloudiness. I can't comment on the intended purpose of this product."
1,did not work for what I wanted to use it for,"I am an avid scrapbooker. I have done a lot of research that you can make your own rub ons for greeting cards and scrapbooking with transparency film. I figured out how to print a mirror image of words on the computer, and printed it out on the transparency film, but it did not work well as a rub on. Unfortunately this was an expensive way to find out that this product does not work for what I need. I now have a full box of this product and cannot use it."
1,You can't go home...,"This book just proves that Brom's work is that of a hack with a leather fetish. He was cool when I was a kid, but now everything he does looks like detailed paper dolls."
5,Perfect!,"When I was a kid through early 20's my wish was to play for the Reds and pitch to J.B. before he retired. Sadly he retired a year before I graduated from high school and 2 years before I was eligible for the draft. Regardless, I am very impressed with the quality and durability of this shirt."
4,Have you experienced with with leading of teams?,"Strongly oriented into leadershim fundamentals. Mike Davidson says directly what is going on. Are you planning new goals? OK compare your aproach with Mike's observations. It's very usefull and prepossing. No empty word, no details leads away , just only crystal pure ideas! It's up to you. You will read it at one bout!"
2,Basically a wizards how-to-book.,"This book does nothing more than teaches one how to use the Oracle wizards to create tables, users, etc... If your new to Oracle, you should learn the syntax of the command lines even thought your in a NT environmet."
2,I change my mind.,"After further review I've decided this book is too superficial (see my review above). I've since traded this book in for ""Oracle 8 Dba Handbook"" and ""Oracle8: Complete Refernce"", both from Oracle. These books really get into the nitty gritty of Oracle."
2,Superficial summary of Oracle 8,"This book is a superficial overview of the Oracle 8.0.4 database. It is a disjointed overview of it's features. It just skips lightly from subject to subject in a seemingly ramdom order. The first 3 chapters are good, it goes quickly downhill after that. It's more appropriate for a management overview rather than for showing someone new to Oracle how to install and configure the product."
3,An Enjoyable Collection,"The Publisher's Weekly summary of this book is right on target: most of these stories are poignant depictions of characters in search of love and acceptance. Feitell does a good job of sketching familiar character types in literary fiction: men and women in their late twenties or early thirties with vague commitment problems and a lingering feeling of missing out on what makes life special. Only one of the stories doesn't work: Such a Big Mr. England is actually an unlikeable story, and should have been left out of the collection. Otherwise, Feitell provides thoughtful and well-crafted pieces. This collection works best if you take a break between reading the stories, as the similiaries in theme and language make the stories blend together if you read them in one or two sittings. The best way to approach this book is one story at a time, and allow a few days between stories. Fans of literary fiction won't be disappointed."
5,AWESOME!,"Awesome book to put you at ease with the troubles in this world! In times like this, you can now learn to be at peace, and not be full of fear! Finally, a book that shows the way, as God intended!"
4,Keepsake,I thoroughly enjoy Antointette Stockenbert's books. She is one of my favorite authors. Keepsake was exciting and suspenseful to the end.
3,New Insight,I enjoyed reading this book as I was learning about some things I knew little about. The relationships and personalities of each sister and their reactions to their mothers hoarding. How the generations kept up the hoarding. The reasons behind the need for this way of life. The difficulties and broken families that result all were presented well.
4,liked it,I found this to be an easy to read romance novel. While it was somewhat predictable it also had some twists. I enjoyed it.
4,Keepsake,"It kept me interested in what was going to happen next! Great romance and suspense, a few typos but great read."
3,Quick Read,"Not badly written but predictable. The main female character was rather annoying and whiny, and I couldn't work up much sympathy or liking for her. When it came to the ""who did it"" part, there was an interesting little twist at the end."
1,Doesn't work,"This item doesn't work. I mean that literally. I couldn't get it to turn on and vibrate even after trying two different sets of batteries. Even it it did work, it looks to me like the straps would just get in the way and would be likely to break. They were cheaply made and the attachments looked flimsy."
2,Bring your machete,"You're going to need it to hack away all the flowery prose to get to the swashbuckling tale hidden underneath. Sir Mortimer Ferne is a privateer (aka pirate) in the employ of Queen Elizabeth. He and some other cronies hit the high seas to go pillage and terrorize the Spanish Main. However, it all ends in disaster and Mortimer is blamed for the fiasco. Banished from court, bereft of friends and fortune, Sir Mortimer sets out on a personal quest to regain his self-respect and honor. Not a bad little story. The reason I'm just giving it two stars is because of all the unnecessary blah-blah-blah that I feel clogs the flow of the narrative."
2,"Oh god, no.","Major storyline issues. Many characters that have a major focus who aren't interesting in the least. Lack of good artwork. /slight spoilers/ Climax is dragged into the ground immedietly by logic thanks to Wolverine and the fact that he defies common sense in the end of this, just to please the Wolverine fanboys. Overall, I really thought this was a terrible end to the series which got dragged through the mud even more with New X-Men."
1,Pass On This,"Colossus returned in the pages of Astonishing X-Men over six months ago. You can find this brillant story (Courteous of Joss Wheton) in the TBP ""Gifted."" If anything, pick it up for John Cassidy's stunning art. As for ""Dream's End,"" pass on it because this is another vain attempt on the part of Marvel to cash in on a grossly irrelevant storyline."
2,And they complain about Chuck Austen?,"I don't know why reviewers complain about Chuck Austin. At least his dialog was funny sometimes, his characterizations really weren't bad, and the fight scenes were pretty well done. I enjoyed his run that occurred right after Morrison left the book.This arc by Peter Milligan has absolutely nothing going for it: an incoherent plot, pacing that is completely off, characters that are annoying in the extreme, lame action, and an utterly silly and ridiculous finale.I actually feel sorry for Mr. Milligan. I guess he's just that desperate for money that he has to take on projects like this for which he is utterly ill-suited."
4,A Worthwhile Read,"I was initially put off of purchasing this story arc because of somewhat negative reviews but was eventually swayed by the presence of Polaris - an X-Man that I think is quite underused - and my two favourites, Remy LeBeau and Rogue. I'm glad I chose to buy Golgotha because I found it to be very intruiging! It's not perfect of course, few graphic novels are, but it's got some very interesting character arcs involving Rogue and Gambit's relationship and, the moment when a thousand fangirls rejoiced, a kiss between Rogue and Wolverine! Sadly, the emotions are never resolved and while the X-Men save the world as always, they're left to go home feeling sort of awkward and unsure of themselves and their relationships with each other. I would've liked to see Wolverine and Rogue's kiss & it's impact on the future of Gambit and Rogue adressed in more than just one lone panel but overall, this is a worthwhile read with some very nice art."
3,Eh.,"This is about The Death of Colossus, right? So why's he brought in at the end? A slow, turgid ale, full of fits & starts, this doesn't really explain why Colossus dies, nor Why he Dies [if you get my drift]. His death is a mere bagatalle, an on-screen off-screen [i.e, unimportant] event.Dull, dull, dull. For -X-men- completists only."
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE,"The price was so inexpensive. The DVD came perfectly packaged and in little time; I like using closed captions and they are available on this DVD. The picture is clear as well as the sound. I have seen this film $30-40.00 more than what I paid. For $9.99, what a great buy and if you like Edward G., well, you have to see this movie!"
5,NO PAIN NO GAIN,"VERY COOL BOOK ON THE ART OF TORTURE, SADIST AND OTHER FOLKS INTERESTED IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY WILL FIND THIS BOOK INFORMATIVE"
4,Good drama...,"The plot of this movie is transparent and overdone, however the character development and drama is quite good.Overall it is a entertaining movie, which I would recommend."
2,Mein Gott! Das Ist Badd!!,"Acht Du Leber! What a ripoff... The studios behind Armageddon & The Day After Tomorrow must've given the OK for this. It's a cheesy, made-for-TV-movie_ish ripoff of them both. H*ll, they even had a Dennis Quade lookalike. I paid $1.99 for a weekend rental special. I think that was a bit high for this. This is one of the few times I'm glad I don't have a dog. The poor thing would be howling for an hour over this."
1,What on earth?,"I watched the preview and decided to rent this from iTunes. That was a big mistake... I remember thinking that the preview probably was the best part of the movie, and sure enough... You'd need an army of disbelief to suspend to make this even plausible.This could have been fun, if it had gone campy and not tried to take itself serious... but NO! And don't even get me started on the ending.I just don't know what they were thinking... This disaster movie is a disaster!"
2,Not Science Fiction at it's best.,"For me this movie was just okay. In many ways, it is a poor man's version of ""Deep Impact"". This would be ""Deep Impact"" without the big name stars, lesser special effects, and a lesser quality script.I love good science fiction, but good science fiction movies are hard to come by. This movie is very slow. This is not entirely bad as long as the slowness leads to good character development, or the addition of quality plot.In the case of this movie, there is too much in the romantic parts, poor acting on the part of the child actors, and cliché upon cliché.I downloaded this movie to my Tivo. $3.99, I guess it was worth that much."
4,Dungle Foo,"Listen, people...If you even watch this movie then you obviously have social issues, but if you watch it and then diss it we need to talk. It has all of the classic hollywood goodies, tear-jerkers, and stomach-squeezers we've grown up with. BudgetBDamned, I'm going to make a movie that destroys the earth, then add a pinch of empathy for children that (shudder) have to live through the apocalypse while their grandpa struggles with his own health. All those buggin' asteroid things falling and making my mobile home less than pleasant reminds me that we're all AMERICAN, and GOD bless 'Merica! :) Classic doughboy fodder. Heat, Eat, Enjoy."
1,God Awful,"Ok I am a Science Fiction geek, to the core. I read the description of this movie and since it got 4 stars I was like oh it must be good. But holy cow, are you people rating this with 4 stars on drugs? First off the science in this film is worse than fantasy, they might as well had wizards and goblins casting spells from the moon. They ignored simple and primitive scientific principles, and the acting felt like I was watching a soap opera. Just absolutely horrible..."
3,Impact,Worth the rent fee but as it is a TV Scifi film not something I would purchase. Its something to have on when you can't sleep at night.
4,Nice disaster movie,"This is a nice little disaster movie.you can see it didnt have a big budget but its entertaining and this is what we all expect from such movies.Yes there are some scientific flaws, but come on...Its pure entertainment, not science education.There might be some better disaster movies but also way more worse!"
4,Overall Good Movie,"In spite of all the criticism, I liked this movie. It's long, but divided into two parts. Characters are interesting and action keeps moving from character to character, place to place - with a bit of sci-fi, tragedy, love, triumph - all rolled together. Some of the effects are a bit silly, but overall, don't get critical and you'll enjoy it for what it is - a movie. You can keep guessing how it will finish, but can never be sure until the end. Bring out the tissues if you're soft hearted."
3,"Forget the Psuedo-Science, My Kids Loved It","OK, so the science is bad. The acting is marginal. Even the special effects aren't so special (the moonscape looks like an asphalt parking lot). I was even surprised at the nonchalant response of earth's inhabitants when they realized they had only thirty-six days to live--a man playing golf, a woman in a field playing the cello, unbelievably no panic. But all that being said, my kids loved it, my wife and I tolerated it, and there's far worse movies out there."
1,The movie gets a - F,Do not like. Horrible They want twenry words. Won't give because morons like to criticise the comments instead of the targeted subject. Read other comments instead who actually say what I wanted to write. I erased what I had before.
3,Not bad,"This movie is a little too broad in focus, which leaves us with too little to care about....that is, not enough characterization to make us care who lives and who dies. However, the idea behind it is very well thought out, and I loved the idea of the fellow who saved the day."
4,Not bad,"For your normal Disaster B rated movie this isnt to bad,As long as you leave out all the scientific reality checks, your good to go on this filmIf you want scientific accuracy then dont watch this film. cause it has Zero!!And it hates being downloaded. the HD version any ways"
3,Decent Disaster Flick,"Well, the writing was atrocious, and much of the dialog was mind numbing, but all in all it's pretty good for a made for tv disaster movie. And at over three hours, you get your money's worth. Good for a one time watch."
4,"Great Burner, network conflicts under NT",Overall this is a great cd burner. My only problem with it would be if you wish to be on the network with the burner using NT server you may have some problems. I would not let this deter you from buying this burner especially if you will only be doing backups or other activities that don't require 100% access to the burner.
2,Not for sensitive skin!!,"Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 1 is extreemely fragrant. The shampoo is pretty much all chemical, it does my hair no favors.I don't use hair spray, or gel and I'm not sure if this is made for people who do but it seems I went from having silky smooth, moist, wonderful hair, to having dry, frizzy, coarse hair that looks aweful. I can not shower and leave my hair to dry. With this my hair will look worse then straw.IF YOU DON'T USE PRODUCTS AND HOT THINGS ON YOUR HAIR I WOULD NOT SUGGEST BUYING THIS.About $2 per OZ to pretty much destroy my hair.I tried this because Wen was so pricey but it was better for my more natural hair. I'm going to go to the Organic store near me and see if they have something that'll work."
5,The Best by Far,"My wife and I have been using Kerastase for over a year now and absolutely love it. Both of us have normal to slightly dry hair. This shampoo leaves our hair silky smooth, not dry and not oily or weighed down. I don't even need conditioner with this shampoo. Compared to the curly girl line and other fancy shampoos, this one is the best we've tried. It's a little pricey, but the 34 ounce container helps a lot with the cost. The 34oz. just has a pour spout so it's meant for refilling."
5,the best!!,"i have been using this shampoo for awhile it is pricey, but worth every penny for it.it makes you hair so shiney and clean and it smell so good. i just love this product."
4,shampoo thats worth the price,this is one of my favortie shampoos. It keeps highlighted hair shiney and glossy. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price. :-)
1,What happened?,"I remember buying this product from a salon a few years ago. The shampoo had a lovely smell and really cleansed my hair very well.I decided to buy the product on here because it was tad cheaper. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. The shampoo I received smelled strongly of undiluted lemon floor cleaner.... you know, the stuff that public bathrooms usually reek of? Not pleasant at all.My guess is that I received a fake product.Too bad I can't return it :/"
3,didn't,"I love this orange line of kerastase products and have been using them (shampoo, leave-in conditioner, hair mask, etc) whenever my budget allowed in the past 5 years. Unlike other people who see extraordinary + effects on their hair, I mostly just love the fragrance of this line which makes my hair smell simply wonderful and makes me happy which makes the high price of kerastase justifiable in my case. Darn if anyone can really explain the power of aromatherapy.Anyway, I snag deals on Amazon whenver I see it. This product was a super great deal at the price I paid for. Shipping was easy with trouble free with the seller as well. No problem with the transaction. But... somehow, the fragrance did not seem to be the same. I don't know why and am disappointed. Did Kerastase change something along the way?"
3,Bain Satin 1 or Bain Satin 2?,"I'm confused as I searched for Bain Satin 1 and when I pressed the link it took me to this page where the photo has a bottle of Bain Satin 2.I bought Bain Satin 2 and it was a bit heavy for my hair, could someone help me out and let me know if this is 1 or 2? cheers"
5,wow,"In the past I always had oily hair. One day I woke up, and my hair was dry. I was in a new world. I didn't have to wash my hair daily, but with fine hair I felt I needed to do it to keep a style. I read many reviews for this shampoo and thought people were exaggerating. I used the shampoo and was happy with the return of the softness to my hair. The amazing thing was the next morning the softness was still there, and my hair retained the style. Now I do not feel the need for the daily wash. I am not back to the oil in my hair that I was used to all my life, but my hair does not feel dry any more. I am somewhere in between and am pleased with that. I have never been able to use conditioner even with the change to dry hair. I am going to try the conditioner next. Many times you try a new shampoo, and it works for a few days. This has been weeks and I still like it... a milestone to me. Put this on your must try list."
4,Pleased so far....,"As a Starfleet Battles player 12-15 years ago, this game was not hard to master. I do feel sorry for people who never played the original game because they get all the complexity at once (even the original game started out simple and grew). Here are some simple tactical tips that still seem to work - 1) Don't be in a hurry to close with other ships until your weapons are fully charged and overloaded, if applicable. This is esp true for Romulans, Gorns, and Feds. 2) If you don't have any charged weapons, keep away from the enemy ships until you do (this was easier in the board game). Use mines to discourage following. 3) Try to deliver as much fire power at once as you can so that you have a chance to knock down a shield. There are lots of tricks like following missiles/drones into the target to add more, etc. 4) Don't forget the extra things like the suicide shuttles, admin shuttles, scatter pack shuttles, mines, etc."
3,"good, but not as fun as starfleet command II",fun skirmishes but the lack of a campaign map like starfleet command II means a limited campaigne. although fun overall.
2,Very Dissapointing,"I have been a fan of Star Trek since the beginning of it all, and bought this game after reading the stellar write ups and reviews. Had extremely high hopes for it, especially since it takes place in the ""classic"" universe. Upon playing it I found that the interface is so complex that to do anything requires clicking at least three different things. Each mission boiled down to this, aliens pounding me while I fire off one shot and stay still waiting for my energy to recharge. 5 minutes later if I'm still alive I might be able to fire again after my engines have been destroyed. And the navigation, how could they have a space combat sim with only two dimensions? Overall a big waste of time and money. Play Elite Force instead."
5,Perhaps Her Best Album,"I've been an Eydie Gorme fan since the '60s and this was the first album of hers that I bought way back then, but it was vinyl and mono and when I saw that this CD was being offered I grabbed it right away.I was not disappointed. The remastering is superb and what a joy to hear the album in stereo for the first time! Not only that, the 9 bonus tracks are WONDERFUL! In short I feel that this CD ranks up there among her best ever albums including ""Don't Go To Strangers"" and ""Eydie"". If you're a big fan like me (no wings attached), this CD is an absolute must!"
1,Disappointing,"I consider myself to be a big Penny Vincenzi fan. I was so addicted to her ""spoils of time"" trilogy that I had read it twice in the span of three years. This is saying a lot for me, since I don't read books more than once unless they are really that good. That's why I hate to be negative about one of her latest books. ""Almost a Crime"" did not grab my attention from the beginning. It was hard to follow the story since it lacked excitement and characters were not very believable. Maybe a huge part of my disappointment had to do with the fact that it is set in the 1990s and lacks the nostalgic charm of No Angel, Something Dangerous, and Into Temptations. I'm still a big fan of Penny vincenzi but not of this particular book."
3,Not as good as other Vincenzi books,"You will follow the saga of a highly successful English couple and their family and friends through various miscommunications, jealous feelings, love affairs good and bad. For me the book was not as compelling as the other Vincenzi books I've read. Still I finished it so that says something."
1,Awful,"Wanting story line, Penny's a great writer but missed big with this one. Just like the title this book is ""Almost a Crime."""
5,Great Hollywood Stars,"A great item to order for all of the Bogart cult-hobbyists. A must have for their film library. You see the bitter-sweet tough guy, with his irresistible built-in lisp, full of emotional complexes and moral rectitude. Bacall plays a highly-sexed, sultry but ironic type of girl. Classics movies to study, enjoy and love!"
3,Desperation is the author of bad purchases.,"I do not recommend buying this machine. It is wobbly at moderate to high speeds, the stride feels like you're plodding and there are few adjustments aside from increased difficulty. To its credit, your buns will get a fabulous workout due to the stride arrangement. If you have little monetary resources to allocate to a piece of exercise equipment, relatively low expectations on performance and few other alternatives then add to cart and proceed to check out. Be forewarned though, she's a rudimentary beast."
4,Pretty convincing!,"Everybody wants to act so tough. These drawling raps over a monotonous (in a good way) synthesizer are like the Halloween soundtrack, but for real and in the ghetto. All minor key and menacing. I believe these guys, and I'm definitely staying off their turf. I bet they could kill--literally--just about any of those hip hop clowns on TV."
3,Kind of plain,"This 2006 wall calendar carries the National Geographic logo but does not appear to be produced by the organization. I assume part of your purchase price goes toward benefiting NG; at least I hope so.There are a total of 12 photos of cute pandas. You can get an idea from the back cover image I uploaded to Amazon. The print quality is good, but the paper is a bit too thin. There's a four-month calendar covering Sept. - Dec. 2005, but no bonus panda picture to go with this page.Holidays observed in the U.S., U.K., New Zealand, Canada and a few other countries are marked, as are the Chinese New Year and Islamic New Year plus the requisite Jewish holidays. You can pencil in a few appointments of your own in the grid cells.All in all this is a good calendar for the price. It's kind of plain, but has nice photos. And hopefully you are contributing to a good cause."
1,Grandkids watches,I ordered two teaching watches in Oct. Both arrived with dead batteries and did not work. Because I did not give the watches to my grand-daughters until Christmas I could not send them back.
1,Very Poor,This is not worth the cost of the $128 dollars. It is an 8 page report with little real susbstance and generally filled with common sense. It does not address the issues in any detail as referenced by it's title.
4,good clean music,fun music for kids. good clean lyric. the dvd is very simple drawings that barely move. like the first mickey mouse movies.
3,DORIA IS THE STAR,"I agree with others here in thinking that Doria Rone is the best thing to be found on this disc. Unforunately, I could find her on only one in other movie and that is DTV film called ""Sensual Pleaures."" I sure wish she would make more"
1,Dumb,Would have been great if it wasn't so damn cheesy. The cheesiness made it difficult to get turned on.
3,Doesn't say much about the Karmann Ghia,"I realize that the Karmann Ghia is just a Beetle with a fancy shell, but I expected that there would be some mention of service items specific to the Ghia. The only place the Ghia is mentioned is on the cover. This book would not be especially helpful for restorers of Ghias."
2,not very instructional,"you would need a pole for most of the routines. Wanted to learn for my hubby. But it seems more soft porn for men, not instructional for dancing. Not quite what I had in mind."
4,Not so pretty anymore but it works,"I really like this square silicone pan, but the red color doesn't stay. I made low-carb bread (high fat content under high heat). After the bread cooled I was able to peel it out of the silicone pan in one piece. Talk about easy! But the silicone pan bottom at the edges and corners lost their color. Fat + high heat turns the silicone back to clear. Even though it looks all blotchy now, the silicone doesn't feel any different. I still use it because it's the best thing out there for square cakes/brownies/bread. Just don't get too attached to the color."
5,perfect,"My wife is an amazing baker! She has a repetoire of many wonderful cookies, many of which are bar cookies. Some of them, with delicious, crumbly bottoms, were always hard to get out of the pan. They would break up. I bought these pans, thinking they would make it a little easier. THEY MADE IT EFFORTLESS!!! She just tips the whole 9x9 slab out, and cuts them, perfectly, on her cutting board! Amazing, so much better than I ever thought! You made me a hero with my wife, who has thanked me with lots of goodies, perfectly formed!"
4,Great Silicon Baking Pan!,"I have made brownies as well as casseroles in this item and I love the great non-stick properties. You do have to put a baking sheet under it, but that is no bother. Easy cleanup and the foods slide right out of it."
5,Works well.,"I actually bought this for candy, and although I haven't used it for that yet it worked well for a batch of brownies. II am not always in love with silicone as the sides can bulge out. (I don't use the loaf pan I have for this reason.) For what I want it for this should work out quite well."
5,"Educational, Fun, Colorful","Every animal is realistic in size and features. The book is bright and colorful so it'll capture the attention of little ones, but it's educational too. Not only will your children read a fun rhyming book, but they'll walk away learning about the alphabet, manners, and so much more."
5,SUBERB!,"I just discovered that Numi no longer makes their Smokey Tarry Tea.....What to do? Well, I ordered this and I like this better. What a fine tea with just the right amount of smokey flavor!"
3,Lapsang Souchong Tea,These tea bags conveniently make a nice cup of tea. I prefer my Lapsang Souchong tea much smokier and more robust than this is but I won't have any trouble finishing all 6 boxes and feeling that I got my money's worth.
3,It's a good book,but not something that I was looking for. Don't have real life examples in detail.......
4,Good music to relax with,"CD was lost in shipping. Got a refund and downloaded it from Amazon for a lot less than the CD. Just like any other compilation, not all the music pieces are equally enjoyable. Overall, the music in ""Love in the Wind"" is good relaxing music and would be good for a bubble bath or a good massage."
2,Not to impressed,"Does it work.... YES, however you have to unplug and plug the USB cable in every time you want to sync. It has serious issues with the USB Host Driver.This may be attributed to the computer; however other USB devices used daily have no problem."
4,Suffering In Silence,"How does a 14-year old jewish boy survive the holocaust? Silently! This movie utilizes silence and a deathly blank stare like a sickle chopping down fresh wheat. You don't just see the holocaust through the eyes of this boy and others, but you actually taste and live it. As the sequences fade in and out of one another you sense the accumulating loss of fate, hope and life. The thin line between survival and death is made very real in this movie. A very well done movie about a very sad and scary time to be a child. And yet some children, though changed by the events, endured. Certain scenes with the accompanying musical score are memorable.""Childhood days are over. You too are part of the common jewish fate now.""""To bear the burden with patience and resignation because God inflicted it on us for our sins, and only from Him can we expect mercy."""
3,SUBTITLES!,"Guess I didn't pay close enough attention to the product description. Don't recall seeing that the film was in Hungarian with English subtitles. I've only watched about 1 hour of it so far but found it rather tedious. Maybe it'll get better.Okay, finished watching the movie. It did get better. The movie is well made, well acted, and realistic. The unfortunate part is the subtitles, as there is a fair amount of rapid dialog and I spent a lot of time just reading the subtitles instead of watching the movie. I'll have to watch it again to appreciate the realistic sets, makeup, and costumes. Worth the money? Yeah, I guess so!"
3,Average,"I'm not so sure this was a movie that deserves 5 stars. I find the Pianist much more deserving. Either way, the movie was OK but I guess for Hungarian cinema it's the best thing that's come out. It was a typical WWII movie about German occupation, Jews being displaced, and in particular this young boy decided to take the wrong mode of transportation that ended up in Auschwitz and a couple of others. Mauthausen was mentioned, but I'm not sure if he was placed there. I thought that this might've been a little bit different but, it still remained an ""average"" movie to me."
5,Excellent Support and Information,"This book confronts the issue of breast cancer recurrence head on with excellent information and quotes from others going through the situation. Without a doubt this book helped change my perspective on this issue and helped me cope with wondering if this one bout of breast cancer was/is my last, or if it's lurking in the future somewhere. I've returned to re-read sections of this book many times and each time I gain new perspective."
5,Recommended!,"This, along with its companion, ""A Kitchen Witch's Cookbook"" are invaluable! In ""A Witch's Brew"", Telesco gives easy to follow instructions for making delicious alcoholic and ""soft"" drinks (I presented a version of the ""Bowl of Plenty"" punch at a baby shower, and had half the people come up to me for the recipe!)Included with each recipe is a little cultural blurb about either the drink or specific ingredients, and a short list of Magical Attributes of each beverage. There are also variations to several of the recipes, so you can feel free to experiment.If you are looking for something to present in Circle or to celebrate a high holy day, the section on ""Seasonal Brews"" is just the thing!"
4,Is that your final SPORTS answer?,"Well it looks like King Regis is turning his attention to the wide world of sports. Makes sense since his best friend is Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz. This game gives the four year old, You Don't Know Jack Sports Edition competition. The questions are much tougher. Even Regis' cracks when you get an answer right are new, and like the second edition (released earlier this year) questions don't repeat as often. I played six games before I reached $1,000 for the first time, and I only bought the game today. Get this game before the year is out, and yes that is my final answer."
3,Depends on your OS and age,"I purchased SEVERAL of the Millionaire Games PC/MAC (dual platform), both Regular(3rd Edition)and Sports Edition. For Middle School age they were great. As adults, as I got SO tired of when you 'bombed' you had to suffer through the whole introduction again.... System Req for PC, it runs on 91/98/Me. For MAC users, it will work on OS 8.6 and OS 9(on iMac), and in OS X, if running Classic--the dual platform of the earlier OS X. Not for OS 10.5 Leopard."
3,CHALLENGING...NOT TRUE TO THE SHOW,"WELL,THE SPORTS EDITION FIRST OFF ELIMINATED SOME SOUND EFFECTS...THE DUM-DUM THING BETWEEN THE QUESTIONS,AND THE 50/50 SOUND,MAKING IT SEEM LESS LIKE ARE AUCTUALLY ON THE SHOW,SAME WITH THE 3RD EDITION. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS,THE QUESTIONS,ARE SO HARD...YOU CAN START AT $100,YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE A $16,000 QUESTION!! ONCE WE LOOKED UP A $64,000 QUESTION ON THE NET (OUT OF LIFELINES OF COURSE,BE PREPARED TO LOSE LIFELINES EARLY THE FIRST TIME YOU PLAY THIS,UNTIL THEY START REPEATING THE QUESTIONS!),AND WE FOUND THE ANSWER,BUT THE GAME SAID IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE! GAME IS NOT TRUE TO THE SHOW. BUT FUN IF YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT SPORTS,BELIEVE ME,YOU HAVE TO,TO WIN THE MILLION,CUZ THEY GET SO TOUGH!THANKS FOR READING ME REVIEW!"
1,TOOOOO EASY!!!,"This Millionaire Sports is for dummies. The questions are so so easy. I won the million the very first time I played it. I don't even watch any sports at all! I even had a five year old play this game and he even one the million the first time. This software is no challenge at all. If you are looking for a challenging game, this game is definitely not for you. I'm warning you, this game is really really easy...."
5,Celebrating the fullness of being,"A Literary Companion, indeed! As a writer, lover of Paris and cafes--I found this book delightful, and the perfect companion for a cold winter day. For like the cafe it celebrates, it has the ability to lift my spirits the moment I ""enter"" its sumptuous pages. Val Clark has done a masterful job in matching up the evocative photographs of Doisneau and Brassai, the art of Van Gogh, Manet, Bemelmans and much more--with the words of writers and artists that endure because they resonate with that fullness of being that the cafe nurtures. This little book pays loving homage to that sensibility. Thank you Val Clark!"
3,Is Cowtown really like this?,"Having been caught up in Cowtown political controversies myself, I found this book most interesting and informative. As the book shows, Cowtown can be a rough place when one gets caught up in the internal politics of the town. Anyone living in Cowtown or any state capital and involved in politics should read this book. As a contract employee and consultant for the Cowtown police department said to me, ""if this kind of stuff really goes on in Cowtown, then we are in big trouble."""
1,Could have used an editor,"It is obvious that after reading the bio that the book is written from personal experience. I think it would have been more meaningful if the author detached himself and looked at several phrases objectively, or he should have hired an editor. There's a lot of repetiveness in phrases, rather depressing at that. I am disappointed so far.... The subject matter is promising, as I'm sure his life's experience were interesting."
2,THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM,"This continuation of Hard Boiled Angel is an interesting one. It involves two criminals who are hypnotized to do dirty work for a dead man whose daughter was kidnapped and sold into a sex trade. At the same time these men want to redeem themselves, but in order to do so they must now become criminals again.The question is then, are they the good guys or the bad guys?An interesting tale I must say because it proves that good and bad has a gray area. At the same time conveying this message takes the entire book, wishing the story would end to move onto another. While this was a long case to solve for Jiran, it was the most creative."
2,Odd slant on Malcolm X,"Decaro is too eager to assess Malcolm X from a Christian viewpoint. For example, he refers to Malcolm X's (once-held) view that there is no afterlife as ""posthumous nihilism,"" and assumes throughout that there is some essential, true Christianity. He also engages in frequent psychoanalytic speculation, without necessarily signalling that he is doing so. This book presents interesting ideas about Malcolm X's religious background and development, but I would read it with some skepticism."
2,This is the same DVD you get for free with recent CD release,"I was looking forward to getting this DVD however it is unfortunately the same DVD you get for free with a recent Greatest Hits ""King of the Road"" CD/DVD release that you can buy for $5. I wish I knew this before ordering it.There is next to no Roger Miller footage on here, it's mostly a standard documentary with Roger's name inserted once in a while. I'm guessing this company did a blanket country music documentary and uses 99% of the same footage for a wide variety of artists.If you are interested in knowing more about Roger Miller, be sure to check out the book ""Ain't Got No Cigarettes - Memories of Music Legend Roger Miller"" available here on Amazon.Hopefully someday someone will release some of the amazing footage that is available out there from his TV show and many TV appearances."
3,Roger Miller - A Documentary,A little disappointed as dvd only lasts 38 minutes and Iam sure that Roger Miller could have a documentary lasting 120 minutes.
5,perfect,"very thorough. has info on a variety of aspects of the t-shirt business. i am using it in stages as i start my own business. i highly recommend this as a nuts and bolts type book, no fluff."
3,Its somewhat informative,This book has good information but I would try to find it used as it is a bit pricey. If you really want the information try to go to a local tradeshow. That seemed to help me more than the book.
3,Too much information for me....,"The book is very thorough. It covers many areas that I did not understand and really do not care to understand. I feel the book would be a lot better if the authors cut out some of the maze of technical jargon and explanations. Maybe I am just a bit too basic because all I wanted to do was prepare and print basic, no frills tee shirts. The book definitely has enough technical information to do any type of tee shirt silkscreening. Be prepared for information overload.I definitely found out that printing tee shirts is a lot more complicated than I thought. Not only complicated, but the equipment to do the job is expensive. The book talked me out of silkscreening tee shirts for a hobby."
5,"Works great, does exactly what you expect it to do","I used my Fellowes Star Manual Comb Binding Machine to punch holes in about 40 pages. I then used these combs to fasten them together. The ""fingers"" fit the rectangular holes perfectly and overlap the solid portion of the comb. The pages turn easily and my booklet feels solid. If you are using a thick back cover or a front and back thick cover I found it better to reduce the number of pages or use the 3/8"" comb."
4,Very Interesting,"I bought this product because my great uncle was held the camp. It was a very interesting, moving documentary. It was a little slow in parts, but gave a good idea of what the people and times were like there."
3,Okay,I was looking for some documentary material regarding WWII (Pacific). This was good information but a little boring in the presentation.
5,Factual film,"My mother, father, grandparents, and sister were in Santo Tomas and this film mimics what I was told growing up. A sad experience for me watching this now that my parents and grand parents are gone."
1,Tacky as %*&^,"I was really excited for these refills to revive the bedazzler from my childhood and bring back the 90s. HOWEVER, I wouldn't put these ""jewels"" on the ugliest piece of clothing I own. The actual studs are different even from the picture on the box -- false advertising much??? The ""jewels"" are tiny and have an ugly silver border that covers up about half of it (which you won't see pictured on the product). I would return this in a second if the shipping cost I would have to pay weren't 2/3 of the cost of the product. Not pleased."
3,Cute!,I wish they had more colors and had even amounts of each in the box instead of gobs of green and orange and only 5 or 6 of red or blue. Some come out broken or unusable but I suppose thats part of manufacturing.
3,Birthday present,"I purchased the refills and the BeDazzler for a third graders birthday. She loved the idea, as I thought, but the pressure needed to BeDazzle was too difficult for her."
4,BeDazzler Refills,"I bought this for a friend who uses the Bedazzler and loves it. But this refill kit has only the small color stones. The original Bedazzler kits have many sizes in one pack, this one does not. There are packs with assorted color stones with many sizes in one pack. This pack is ok if you want one size of stones."
4,Granddaughter Gift,5 yr old granddaughter says it is COOL and she is able to decorate her clothes now with sparkles. YEAH !
2,Poorly made,"Dynamat makes two versions of this roller, a cheap one and a more expensive one.The more expensive one is rather overpriced and should probably cost about the same as this one.This one, unfortunately, is so cheaply made that it is just not very usable. The wood roller (instead of the hard rubber of the better one), means that it slips along the Dynamat instead of stretching it, and pressing it harder into the surface, which is necessary to get rid of the little gaps and bubbles that reduce performance.Even though the more expensive one is overpriced, I still recommend buying it instead of this one. If you buy this one, you'll probably be back in short order to buy the better one, and that will waste even more money.Here's a link to the better one:Dynamat 10007 Professional Heavy Duty Roller"
2,"Economy,","in this case, means CHEAP. If you plan to use this item more than once, do yourself a favor and upgrade to the fancy, expensive one or purchase a roller designed for vinyl flooring installation. The brackets on this are weak and bend to allow the wheel to fall out.It does what it it was designed for."
1,It's a wall paper seam roller! For gosh sakes!!,Don't waste your money. This is a wallpaper seam roller that you can buy at the hardware store for three bucks. It isn't intended for heavy materials like Dynamat.Jeeeez!
1,broken in 4 minutes flat,"This piece of junk was broken in 4 minutes flat. It could not hold up to the pressure of being removed from its shipping box, need I say more."
2,"Dynamat 10005 Roller 1"" hardwood","Falls apart after time. I also installed dynamat throughout my entire car not just a panel. For a small panel it is probably good, but for large items, I would upgrade."
2,economy roller,It is what it is. you get what you pay for. The bracket that hold the roller was junk. the rest of the roller was good. worked well until the roller kept coming out.
1,Not a good roller.,This roller do not work well. I only used it several times and it fell apart on me. The spindle or whatever that holds the roller in place broke off while in the middle of my work. I end up holding it with two hands to finish my project.
2,Awesome Tool but Poor Construction,"I just finished my Dynamat installation in my car and this tool was infinitely valuable! However, this particular roller was below what I'd consider to be of good construction. The two metal peices holding the roller cylindar in place kept bending outward causing it to dislodge mid use. I probably had to stop my work, disassemble the roller, and repair it at least 10 times over the course of this single car installation.Is a roller like this worth it, DEFINITELY! However, I'd check the reveiws on a few others of like design and buy one of those.A tip for those installing Dynamat, look for one a little thinner than this also. It worked great and I wouldn't demerit it over the width, but I found that it was slightly wider than many of the molded grooves in the car body. A slightly narrower one would have worked better."
2,Not durable,"The product worked well for awhile, but after using it to put Dynamat on just three door panels the metal part began to loosen and the roller would fall out of its mount if I pushed too hard. I had to hold the metal tight with my other hand while I rolled."
2,Don't bother,"My GF was curious to see the training a SEAL was put through to forge someone into the top notch warriors we know them to be. Unfortunately this is a DOD recruiting flick, short and pretty much lacking in any substance. Not worth even $.99, let alone $1.99."
1,"If you don't have a laminator, wasting money","I bought these because I was going to draw out some luggage tags to put on my bags and that they were reasonable.Pro: I got a lot! I though I was getting 5, but it came with around 40 or moreCon: If you don't have a at home laminator your wasting your money. It comes with the leashes and the firm is loose so you put your image in and run it through the machine... But if you don't own a machine it's a real pain in the butt. I had to go to office max to get it done and they charged me 1 each one. Not a problem but it's a hassle to drive to print shop."
1,Unclear description,"The description of this article was unclear to me. I ordered four and expected four tags, but I received 25 pouches to laminate with a business card inserted. Once I figured it out, the pouches were good and durable. I returned the remaining three packages."
4,Good value but Light Duty,"I actually bought these for another purpose - to create durable, dripproof tags for all the plumbing valves around my basement and especially the boiler. They worked great for that purpose - just use Avery business card blanks and your computer.You don't even need the machine that these are made for ... I just used the cardboard carrier supplied, and a clothes iron.These are a good value for what they are, but for actual luggage tags I would look for heavier gauge material, though. These don't seem like they would stand up to airline handling."
1,There's nothing 'complete' about this piece of fluff,"This book is not for anyone who knows anything about numerology. I wonder how much time Regis Philbin invested reading this book! Silly me - I bought it because of his recommendation on the jacket. Between the colorless one word definitions of numbers substituted for character analysis, career choices and my future, 14,000 years of history from cro-magnan cave civilization to Plato, Pythagoras and every other number maven in six short paragraphs without transitions, numerous angel sightings and biblical sounding affirmations for miracles, many pages invested in guidance for recognizing winning lottery numbers , confusing astrology info interjected, confused organization of material and a difficult to read type squeezed onto a penurious publisher's page- there is little meat to digest and after reading the jacket hype, I am very sorry I didn't buy angel blessed lottery tickets with the money I paid."
4,"Interesting and somewhat accurate, sub paths?","I found this book interesting. I'm not a serious student of numerology. I wasn't looking for a long history of numerology, and found the history in this book was the right amount for me. Otherwise, I thought the number challanges described towards the end of the book were extremely accurate for me. All of the stuff on individual letter analysis was interesting and seemed right. Something that frustrated me was the sub path section. I could not figure out from the book how to do the calculation, and the example did not seem to relate to what was given as the result. A better example would have been nice. If anyone knows how the subpaths bit is done, please post it."
5,Simple easy to understand...,"This book was a great introduction to Numerology for me. Joyce and Jack Keller show how to unlock secrets to life that numbers hold in this well written and easy to understand book. Looking to the answers to questions Numerology generates, you can find your self and your path. Don't miss this one..."
