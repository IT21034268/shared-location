2,Selling pretty pictures,"I can't muster the beautiful sarcasm of other reviewers, but it is true that Wolfram must believe he is either God or a used car salesman. It is amazing that anyone takes this book seriously. Reads like propaganda for a hostile takeover of science from a CEO. Some of it may be good (the things I don't know anything about and can't judge) but the biology section is vacuous. As far as I can tell, this is a big book about why the author thought of everything before anyone else."
5,A Mathematical Prophecy,"Wolfram is an authentic genius; enormous egos are common in that circle.Based largely upon his personal vision, a novel era of experimental math research will soon open.That era will reveal vast, hitherto unsuspected fields of knowledge and entertainment. Its cultural impact will be comparable to the advent of television and personal computers.Those who now believe they have put Wolfram firmly in his place or dismissed the actual thrust of this volume will, in a few short years, seriously reconsider their positions."
3,A New Kind of Megalomania,"The book is very heavy. If you like to read on your back, it will hurt your tummy. A lighter version would say this:- there are many kinds of cellular automata- some of them, despite their apparent simplicity can generate complex or beautiful output (don't tell the publisher, but automata rule #143 generates this book after about 25 million steps)- the new kind of science is that you should study simple rules and find out if any of them generate nature. this is faster than looking at nature and trying to uncover simple underlying rules since there are far less simple rules than there are observable phenomena- when this approach is tried on fundamental physics, it renders chapters that are as un-understandable to me as regular fundamental physics- the approach can be applied to any part of science, so everyone get to work"
1,the I's have it,"I was very, very disappointed in this book ... had expected something disciplined and original. Instead (and I believe unintentionally) it comes off as an extended commercial for -- Mathematica! Stephen Wolfram! If you are new to topics of evolution and complexity, and you find a germ of inspiration here (somewhere within the book's overwhelming mass of pages, first-person pronouns, ""beliefs,"" 2-D diagrams of simple automata -- but no room for references!), then good for you. I do appreciate the author's evident sense of wonder. Unfortunately, much of that wonder is wasted on a narcissistic insistence that the Wonder is Wolfram's Alone (courtesy Mathematica). Here's the irony: yes, beautiful things emerge from reiterative interactions; yet the author walls himself off from direct intellectual interaction (an editor, maybe?), and so the force of his ideas is self-limited and rapidly spent."
1,Read the book before you write a review,"My line of reasoning is quite simple,this 1.200 page book appeared on May 14th 2002. No one (except for those in Wolfram's inner circle) has had the time yet to read (let alone absorve) the meaning or implications of this book.Yet there are already quite a number of reviews pontificating on the validity (or else) of his theories. I suggest reviewers stop trying to be the first to publish a review and have the honesty to try to understand first a work that took 10 years to write, before they comment.Amazon should also provide for the eventuality and not force readers to choose between 1-5 stars (i.e. by providing another option such as ???)"
3,"My Goodness, the Grammar, The Grammar!","Today I checked out the few preview pages on Stephen Wolfram's site. The graphics were pretty, and some of the ideas that he presented were, at first glance, attractive, but the majority of paragraphs and sentences started with ""and"", ""but"", ""or"", or ""yet""! Come on, if this book was proofread *once*, somebody would point this out! I'm planning on buying the book, but I'm going to edit it myself. ..."
2,a new kind of science? yes. A good kind of science? no!.,The only thing I learned was to be wary of the media that hypes up non-events. So what if Wolfram is a genious or an ex-child prodigy. He doesnt have anything interesting to say. He displays interesting patterns with similarities to natural patterns. Is there a connection? How?There is also a tendency to not credit others who have related or competing theories in complexity. It sounds like he merely selling his ideas like one sells a commercial product. I hope this is not how science is done in this century.
4,A SIMPLE FORMULA CAN EXPLAIN LIFE!!!,A simple formula can explain life.But to explain the formula Wolfram needs a million words.Sometimes he will even remind us in one chapter what he discussed in the previous chapter anything to add words. This book is heavy in words.Example a simple beautiful idea explaining complexitySystems with simple rules can produce behavior that is complex.The readers believes the hypothesis but is lost or even bored in the explanation. A new kind of science needs a new kind of way to explain it. How about simple sentences without redundancy.I gave this review 4 stars because I beleve the ideas in this book will benefit all areas of scientific research.
1,A Crushing Disappointment,"After waiting a long time for ANKOS to appear, a quick review revealed my worst fears: not only is this author megalomaniacal, he has also completely misrepresented his work. Far from being a new kind of science, his work is merely a deeper (and, in fairness, sometimes more creative) look at results available for years from others fully his equal. It is a bitter disappointment to have been fooled into thinking that the publication of this work would result in a landmark of scientific thought. True scientific luminaries will not, after all, have to slide down the bench to make room for another place."
2,Just So Stories,"This book is not science, and it isn't new, but if you just read it as novel and look at the pictures it isn't too bad.The arguments are reminicent of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stores.For example, How did the zebra get his stripes?I don't know, but here is a cellular autonoma that produces the same pattern.How did the leopard get his spots?I don't know, but here is a cellular autonoma that produces the same pattern.ETC, ETC, ETC."
2,Careful,"There's a danger in confusing two different things together. One can use affine fractals to draw pictures of mountain landscapes, but the rules of fractal construction teach you absolutely nothing about the physics or geology of mountain formation. Likewise, you will learn nothing about leopards simply from constructing patterns that look like leopard spots. Computational universality is very powerful: you can compute any computable number or function, but the way that those numbers and functions appear empirically in nature will remain not explained. To believe that nature is like a ca says nothing unless the program is specified. where did the program come from? I recommend instead the chapters on symmetry as the basis of physical law in Wigner's Symmetries and Reflections, a very beautiful book."
2,Science,"For a reader interested in science the book will bedisappointing The words ""I"" and ""my"" apear too frequently inthe text. If you are able to skip pages the book can be entertaining.The book is a MUST for wallpaper designers"
3,Thick,"I think the author makes many good points about the potential of the possible benefits to science to be had by stepping outside conventional methods. There's so much going on in this book that I couldn't possibly grasp it all, especially considering my limited mathematics knowledge. More examples and metaphors would have been helpful also, but unfortunately, in the authors opinion they do more harm than good as he notes early in the notes section."
3,Reviewing the reviews....,"I confess I haven't read the book, I was just browsing the reviews and pondering whether to buy it or not. However, I couldn't help sharing my amazement at some reviews:-""This could be the most important book of this millennium, affecting our concept of biology, economics, history, man and the universe."" - Top 1000 Reviewer-""It could be that Wolfram will rightly be hailed as the Isaac Newton of the twenty-first century"" - Top 100 Reviewer-""the reading of A New Kind of Science leaves a feeling of being privileged to witness a Copernican revolution from the front row""-""This book itself is a monument, written by an absolute genious""Such comments made me highly suspicious, to say the least...I will buy the book, but I'm not expecting to be amazed anymore: I just hope not to be too disappointed. Could it be that ""A new kind of science"" turns out to be just ""A new kind-of science"" ?!"
2,A Good Experimental Exercise,"Go to the bookstore, and read it for a while. Look at the sections which are most related to your field.Mr. Wolfram relies on computational methods much more than a scientist should do.Computers show us the plausible directions; however, they are sadly limited in many aspects, in terms of science.Isn't this a promotion for his Mathematica?"
2,Dimension of the Debate,"Read this book if you are a psychologist or sociologist and you want to see first hand how a man's ego can get out of control if he isolates himself from society for a decade.What is presented is not science, but a form of math.The concepts of cellular automata are not new.As a result, the book's title should be ""An Old Kind of Math"".The algorithms shown are correct and there are some new and very interesting observations. The debate over a book like 'The Origin of the Species' centered on the truth of the content. The debate over this book centers not on the truth of the algorithms presented but over the ego-distorted orientation of the author."
2,The Core Issue,"The book fails to explain how the automata should be designed so that they evolve as do natural entities. Thus cellular agents have no connection to useful work. Wolfram does not even come close to this issue, the only central question in the automata ""field"".He only plays, as some rich scientist who has run out of ideas might play.One serious 10 page paper on how to model such agents for useful purposes would be worth 10 such books."
2,Grandiose but unsatisfying,"This is an elegantly designed yet arrogant and verbose volume. (As the reader is informed, writing the book took more than a hundred million keystrokes and more than ""a hundred mouse miles."")So far, in reading it I have found three propositions: (1) The author, Wolfram, is a genius; (2) Simple programs can produce complex results; (3) Mathematica can be used to produce interesting patterns that have elements of repetition but are not symmetrical.The first of these propositions I leave to your own judgement (and that of history). The second is obviously true to any programmer. The third seems kind of trivial for the grandiose claims made.Speaking of grandiose claims, I keep trying to find the ""new kind of science"" promised in the introduction (and the hype). Maybe I need to study it further, but I just don't see anything justifying the claims here."
1,New title: A re-hashed sort-of-kind-of-a science,"It took me less than 5 minutes in a bookstore to understand the main points of this book, and the author's never-ending hubris. Let me save you the time: Cellular automata (or a very simple procedural rules) can generate complex patterns that cannot necessarily be determined to repeat themselves. Oh... and the author thinks this ""discovery"" should be regarded with the same as one might consider those of Galileo, or Newton (though I prefer Hooke), or Darwin, or Einstein. Well, he may have spent 10 years of his life devoted to it... but the evidence in the book alone is unconvincing."
2,On the Principle of Computational Equivalency,"This book builds up to the last chapter in which the author presents his hypothesis: the Principle of Computational Equivalency (PCE). The principle states that there cannot exist a process on the universe that can compute something that cannot be computed by a Turing machine (or a cellular automata, or any other universal computational device). The fact that every machine is Turing-equivalent is not news to computer scientists. The PCE extends Turing-equivalency by hypothesizing that human beings, quantum mechanics, complex systems, etc. are all also Turing machines. Of course, this hypothesis can't be proven, nor easily disproven, so the contributions in this book remain merely inspirational.In general, the book seems to me to be a big dissapointment. However, it does have a lot of pretty pictures!"
5,very interesting book,"I do not like the term ""genius"" but I do like very interesting ideas. The ideas in Dr.Wolfram's book may not be entirely original or new, but I don't think that is the point. Even though the book is written in a tone that I was not comfortable with, I try to focus on the thoughts and information that are new to me. The important thing to me is that it leads me to look at the world from a different perspective. And I think it is an important perspective.I am also grateful for those reviewers (some obviously are experts in various fields) for pointing out the background information of these ""new"" ideas and the flaws of the book."
3,Judging by Stephen's prior accomplishments...,"I used Mathematica back when I was a research student - not long ago. It is one of the most innovative software I have ever used. It may not be the most stable, bug-free software - but it presented opportunities that never had been easily achievable before. It was just not possible to work on the analytic part of science before it - we have to live with numerical approximations of equations.Now - I am trying to get hold of a copy of this book - but with no luck. Good, I like that - lot of people out there to get hold of a copy too. Anyway if this book is as good and innovative as Mathematica was (is), then I dont doubt for a moment the validity of concepts presented in this book.However, unlike some not-so-patient readers out there, I will reserve my final thoughts and comments till I get the copy of this book and read all the 1000+ pages in it. I urge others to do the same - for sanity's sake. Heard of FUD?"
3,Rule 42,"Gregory Good, my fellow Canucklehead from Vancouver ;-) beat me to it. Rule 42, that's what I want, dagnabit.And then I want a sequel that tells me what the question was.I was playing ""Life"" and studying cellular automata when Wolfram was still called tungsten."
2,Pompous and nearly useless,"This book is a wonderful demonstration of the use of grayscale, and not much more. I will provide two of many examples that support the title of this review.1.) Chapter 10 pp 552 a section with the purpose of defining randomness. Stephen begins by outlining the failure of previous attempts to define randomness. Then he leads the reader to believe he has found the answer. Then he proceeds to identically fail to advance the notion of randomness in any way whatever.2.) Chapter 2 pp 223. ""One might think that starting from such randomness no order would ever emerge."" Who thinks that? Certainly not I. This book is replete with examples of Stephen starting from a baseless assumption and then showing how his book lifts us from this state of ignorant belief to novel enlightenment. When if fact, not a single possibly worthwhile idea in the book is original to him.Signed : Ph. D. from MIT and definitely not a layman."
2,Not Worth It,"The basic idea that complexity can be obtained by very simple rules is not new. The idea that the Universe, in all its complexity, may be a result of very simple (computational) rules is not new. And looking at lots (and I mean *lots*) of fractal-like, cellular automata, game of life like, black and white pictures is no fun at all. The pictures tell you nothing. You need to understand the text to understand the pictures. But if you understand the text, you don't really need the pictures. (A few pictures would be o.k., but hundreds is not good.)I think the basic info in this book, the basic theme, could be written in under 100 pages. This is not a ""how to"" book. It doesn't tell you how to replace current math, physics, etc. with something new. It only suggests that it might be possible to do so by considering ""it all"" as computation and by finding/defining simple computable systems.Some interesting ideas. For me, not many new ideas. Glad I didn't buy the book. (Borrowed a copy.)"
3,"Yuri Kuzyk, please give more detailed references","This book is worth a read for the simple fact that it has already generated a lot of debate.I'm curious to follow the references mentioned in Yuri Kuzyk's review, however I think some of them might be journal articles, and I'm having a hard time tracking them down."
3,Tripe!,"Though I haven't read this book, I AM a registered owner of a car and I played baritone in the middle school band. I have added up all of Wolfram's equations on my TI calculator, and they're all false! All I get is ""EEEEEEEEEEEEEE"". Furthermore, I am whole disappointed....as a person who understands nothing I expected this book to light my fire...but it appears to be flame retardent! Thank you for allowing me to waste your time...much like the rest of these reviews. I didn't know we has so many theoretical physics experts in the haus!"
3,Pretty patterns,"The mathematics aren't new and the science isn't really revolutionary, but as an artist friend of mine has pointed out, the pictures are excellent as inspiration for new patterns in knitting, weaving or modern art."
1,autonomic drivel,"""i have seen the future""..and its not a new kind of science. There is no science, no insite, no new big thing, no gratification, no a-ha, no clue here. I too can write simple software programs that mimic autonomic functions, anyone can, that ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT MEAN that the entire universe started from a few....I started laughing at page 3....."
2,who owes an apology?,"I heartily agree with the last author about an apology. However, one should note that most of the present-day ""experts in the field"" and, in particular, those in biology are so narrow-minded and obsessional, that even such an individual as author of this book can incite a certain amount of interest among the general reader.Therefore, my suggestion is that the scientific community owes a GREAT apology to the common readers for not having produced any real genius in last 50 years. Not to mention current publishing and funding policies inside that scientific community that make almost impossible any major advancement in science."
3,Worth reading..but dont hurry,"Wolfram is a brain - there is no doubt about that once you conquer this sprawling work. You can however, get a pretty good idea of what it's about by reading some of the longer reviews on this site. There are likely a couple of hundred other books that you would be better off reading first, so decide if this is what you want to do with your reading time. What's more, while it is worth reading, dont hurry, there will be plenty of used copies available in the future."
1,degenerating brilliance,"Unfortunately it is not uncommon for brilliance to degenerate into self-absorbed delusions of grandeur in later life...but it is sad and embarrasing for the rest of us to watch. At least he is protected by his own ""belle indifference"" to reality. There are still nuggets of interest in the book but it is doubtful they are worth searching out in this tedious tome. There really is no new science here that others aren't already developing with more substance. The alarming thing is how many major publications are giving such rave reviews and comparing him with Newton and Einstein (who also completed their best work when young). What pop slop. Try the more intelligent reviews like Physics Today...and this reviewer is being KIND (so am I)."
2,Single mindedness is bad even if it's a brilliant mind,"The lack of proper reference to those minds that have studied and articulated complexity and cellular automata gives the impression that Wolfram solely thought up and now presents the ideas. No great ideas are exclusive. The book appears to be a self generated hoo rah for himself, oh and a little bit of computer generated plot. After lugging this monster around for way too long I finally just dropped it to door stop status and now it serves a much higher purpose than its content deserves."
2,"Nice graphics, old content","Just about everything that's in this book was said more succinctly in an April 1988 Atlantic Monthly article about Ed Fredkin's ideas. But pretty graphics, though."
2,trivialities on steroids.,"This book seems like a Martin Gardner ""Mathematical Games"" column from an old Scientific American magazine, gone totally bonkers. A new kind of Science is Conway's game of ""Life"" turn into a nightmare. The use of ""I"" and ""me"" and ""myself"" (Only Irene is missing here) is so incredible pervasive as to make this book illegible. Perseverant readers will find out that ""A New Kind of Science"" is a collection of trivialities on steroids."
1,less than useless,"Less than useless because I really wanted to check it, so I wasnt satisfied until I crawled until the end of it - therefore it also made me waste a lot of time, while teaching me essentially nil.This is not science - science demands references to what people did before you.The grandiose final belief of the author - that small programs are able to explain everything in the universe - is just partially right and much better explained by other authors, e.g. Chaitin."
4,Fresh outlook on science,"I found this book to be a fresh outlook on science. Yes, it does have a couple faults such as its enormous size and dogmatic writing...but all in all I found this a very good book. It's not afraid to break some rules. It points out that biology may be a better microscope than physics to view our world. I would say that this book is a cross between THE TAO OF PHYSICS and STILL PITYING THE FOOL."
1,A Science Kinda New,"Simplicity may evolve complexity, but complexity is not reality, which is imperceptible by any conceivable sensory and cognitive armamentaria. No amount of cogitation or revelation will avail the author, whose vision ultimately is merely a clearer view of a horizon beyond which he can never see. Hoorah, I guess."
3,What about for a beginning scientist/ intellectual?,"I Hvae given this book 3 stars because I did not want to upset the average- I have not really read the book and I am wondering whether to purchase it or not. I can understand how people experienced in the fields that Wolfram deals with might be disappointed, but what about this book for a beginning scientist/ intellectual? Would it be fascinating for someone not very knowledgeable in complexity theory, etc? Could reviewers give their opinions on this either before or after their critiques? I'm a poor college kid and don't have a lot of time to waste on useless books."
3,New kind - old kind - science is science,"I am not an expert on this subject by yet, here's my opinion: The term new kind of science reminds me of the expression the ""new economy"". The book is interesting but the foundations of the old science are still sound. What is interesting is how computational tools may be used to explore aspects of systems and also it has an interesting artistic edge."
2,"Nice cellular automata pictures, otherwise useless","If you are looking for a collection of cellular automata pictures with lots of useless text between the pages this might be your book. Other than that it is another boring attempt of claiming revolution. The text is high-level, never gets to the point and hell will probably freeze until you'll meet someone that made it through that book. Not worth reading but its definitely something to put on your bookshelf if you want to make a geeky impression on your visitors."
3,"Might be good, too sloppily written","I will probably muddle through the book because I suspect the ideas are interesting and important. However, the writing is sloppy. For the author spent a great deal of time arguing his points in his head. And he believes that he must bludgeon you with continuous expressions of how he surprised himself with his results. But as an ordinary mortal whom the author presumes a simpleton, you will be very amazed at the extremely remarkable findings.I suspect that one quarter of the sentences in the book begin with ""and"", one quarter with ""but"", one quarter with ""for"". The remaining sentences are the ones that add content.This book needs an editor."
1,Don't waste your time,"Wolfram was perhaps a good scientist 20 years ago, but no longer. With the wealth generated from Mathematica, he has forgotten how to do research and how to write science.I am just wondering how Wllfram's many assistants, which he lists in the book and include many physicists and mathematicians, allowed this book to the publication. They should have adviced candidly their boss how poor this book is."
1,This guy is absolute egomaniac.,"Who edited the book? This book has 2-3 ""I's"" and ""me's"" in a sentence. It was disgusting. I discovered this I discovered that, without me scientists couldn't do this or that. Not even a drop of simple modesty in that book. Don't waste your time and money on this book (by the way the way it's printed is absolutely wasteful the font is big the line breaks are huge the book has 1200-1300 pages that you can easily fit in 400page book) Anyway buy a good math or physics book don't waste your money on this one."
2,Encyclopaedia of somewhat interesting but useless digressions,Seems Wolfram spent 10 years on adderall creating a cross referenced collection of stories about how smart he is with very little worthwhile material.
3,"Good overview of the subject, but...","If you are new to computer science you might begin to read this thick book and think that it's the cat's meow. Such an interesting concept that from simple rules could come infinite, or vast but finite, complexity. Well, after reading the first couple of reviews on Amazon, I have to conclude that there really isn't anything new in this book, save a good tutorial and way of bringing this material to school children. Still, for an overview on the subject of complexity, and a way of teaching it, I can confidently recommend it... - lc"
1,There goes fifty bucks I wish I could get back!,"There is little if anything I can add to the many negative reviews that have already been written about this book, other than to add my voice to the chorus. Needlessly long, repetitive, unoriginal, self-aggrandizing. That about sums it up. The most significant impression I got from this book came as the result of accidentally dropping it on my own foot. Ahaw, Ahaw. Am I not droll? Seriously though. Don't waste your time or money on this book.The one observation I have not yet seen expressed (Or as Stephen would put it: ""The single most surpising discovery I have ever made"") is that it is an entertaining diversion to re-create the algorithms in Wolfram's book using Microsoft Excel."
2,An example of ego overcoming the marketplace of ideas,"Unfortunately, the overblown ego of Steven Wolfrum, has kept him both from submitting his ideas to criticism before publishing. Had he done so, he would have learned not only that his ideas are not as unique as he claims, but also that others have done a better job of expressing his ""big ideas.""In many ways, I'm not a capable reviewer of this book. His many-time repeated attempts to tell me that his ideas were incredibly new turned me off to the book so much that I was unable to complete it. Still, this may be indicative."
1,Mirror Matter is more interesting,This book is indeed a new kind of science It is science of the worst kind. It does not helpin understanding any of the current mysteries in nature. What is the identity of the dark matterin the Universe? Are there new elementary particles to be found? Why are there only fourfundamental forces? Will the Universe expand for ever? It does not live up to the hype.
4,The Future of Life?,"I found this book interesting primarily for one reason. It made me wonder whether cellular automata like the ones highlighted in the book or in Conway's Life could actually create ""true life"". In other words, given enough time on a big enough ""playing board"" would complex societies of beings develop on par with biological life in terms of their complexity and lifelike behaviors. If so, why can't we see more research directed to this very goal: to create life in a computer -- life that surprises us, that can teach us, creatures that live and dream."
4,Challenging--A Collector's Item,"Generally I read two-thirds of the books I buy, and review two-thirds of the ones I read. Stephen Wolfram's book proved to be too much for me. Although I was not planning to review it because I cannot claim to have read it properly, I decided to post a recommendation: buy this book even if you might not read it all. The author has subsidized the work, and the book is far more valuable than its price."
1,A New kind of Prophet,"In my glorious reading of The New Kind of Science , I discovered a most fundamental discovery that will enlighten the world for eternity. This discovery can be summarized in my most important Equivalence Principle; Tipler is equivalent to John the Baptist, Wolfram is equivalent to Jesus Chris, and (here is where I get confused) either Mathematica is the Holy Sprit and the Book is the Omega Point or is it Mathematica the Omega Point and the Book is the Holly Sprit?The problem is either way, we are stuck with a great expense..."
3,Disturbing and provoking.,"I found this book very disturbing. I live near the Clear Lake of the title and much of the background detail is very accurate. To have such horrible things happen in a setting that I know personally made it hard for me to differentiate between fact and fiction.The story was very compelling, but I wish that it had been proofread more thoroughly. Errors in spelling and syntax make it difficult for me to enjoy a book.Even so, the story is going to stick to the roof of my mind."
1,The Truth,It is hard to decipher what is truth in this book. Being from the area and knowing the author makes me wonder. If you can't be truthful in one aspect of life then how can you expect to be taken serious in the book. Reader beware!!!
4,Collected by Joseph Jacobs,"This is, in fact, the collection of stories that Joseph Jacobs collected in the late 19th or early 20th century, inspired by the work of the Brothers Grimm. Jacobs traveled throughout the countryside of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and he wrote the stories down as much as possible in the language in which they were told to him -- old fashioned folklore collection. These collections used to be available in Dover Editions, although I don't know if they are still. (Do Dover books ever go out of print???) The table of contents is not navigable, which could be a nuisance, but free is a good price. You could try constructing your own ""table of contents"" using bookmarks or highlights....The stories are enjoyable, and fun to read aloud to kids. I'd give it 5 stars if the table of contents were navigable, take off 2 for the nuisance factor, add one because it's free. Four seems fair."
3,Free download,This book was downloaded for free on Amazon Kindle. I have started to read this book but it didn't keep my interest so I never finsihed it.
3,Not really for kids,"I bought this to read to my daughter while she goes to sleep. I've only read the first 3-4 stories, but they all have to do with someone being killed, someone dying, or someone getting hurt. I've had to change some of the words around as I'm reading to her so she doesn't have nightmares."
2,Fairy Tales,"I was excited about this book, thinking I could read these fairy tales to my 4 year old. There are so many grammar problems, missed capitalization, periods. Just awful."
2,Not The Redd I Know,"If you're looking for the ""classic"" Redd Stewart sound, don't look here. Overproduced attempt at mid - late 60's mainstream country. Boring, souless, he sounds like a thousand other wannabe country singers on this snoozer of an LP. Sounds nothing like Redd did when he was still with PeeWee King and The Golden West Cowboys.If you're looking for Redd's ""solo"" material, look for older cuts, like ""Take Back Your Paper Heart"", or I'm Worried ('Cause I'm Losing You) (by ""Redd Stewart And His Kentucky Colonels""). This LP (or CD) was a huge disappointment for me."
4,Good For Short Attention Spans,"""Hercules"" tells the story of the twelfth and final labor. This truncated version of the Hercules myth is good for young children who are unable to concentrate on a full retelling of all twelve labors. But the best thing about this book are Raul Colon's illustrations. Colon is a talented illustrator and his richly evocative images really bring the story to life. Finally, if your child has the ability to focus on a more detailed version of the Hercules myth, I would recommend James Riordan's version."
2,Water sports?,"I was a huge fan of Bowerman and the runners until I read about his penchant for urinating on his athletes in the locker room shower. You might disagree with me and try to justify his behavior as some sort of coaching tool or trick but no matter how you slice it it is still an old man peeing on boys in a shower. I would rather have not been given this insight into the ""Great"" and ""Legendary"" Bowerman."
3,Okay overall,"Book is in good shape, but it looks like it was taken from a library, with the library's stamps all over it."
5,Men of Oregon,"Track and field is lucky to have in Kenny Moore the perfect person to write a biography of coach Bill Bowerman. Kenny not only is a fine writer, but he was coached by Bowerman and was an intimate of the great running guru. I purposely read the book in snippets to drag it out. It was like eating candy. I never wanted it to end. Bowerman came across as a most fascinating individual, not only as a track coach, but as an incredibily complex and talented man."
5,Review from a life long runner.,"To be short and sweet: The descriptions of those track events from so long ago, could not have been written any better. Kenny Moore was witness and participant in many of the events he writes about, and is a great writer to boot. Lucky i'm a slow reader so I got to enjoy this for a few months.If you are a runner / track+field buff, add this to your collection! I had to order a subscription to T+F News after only getting halfway through this :-)"
2,Disappointing,"I read some of the other customer reviews and am mystified. I'm a big fan of Demille titles, generally speaking but found this one hihgly diappointing. I was barely able to finish it. I found the plot incredibly unbelieveable (and confusing) and the book is full of an incredible number of characters, none of whom has a focused picture or about which you care. My recommendation: read just about any other Demille title."
5,Book Review,One of DeMilles better books. Keeps you in suspence the entire way. This is the last book in the series I have read. Can't beat him as a suspence writer.
4,DeMille DeBest,"The Talbot Odyssey works great as a thriller tale told in 1980s. But if you were born after 1990, you may not get the urgency of the Cold War spying and nuclear one-ups-man-ship older generations lived with since WWII. But even without that, it's still a masterfully told story, cliffhanger plot, and colorful characters. I mean, what else do you want? It won't change your life, but it will entertain you as you try to figure out who's on which side right now!"
3,the talbot odyssey,"Don't get me wrong, I love reading DeMille books (at least the 7 previous ones) but this one left me disappointed.The lead character, Tony Abrams, is not the ""colorful"" individual I've enjoyed in several of DeMille's other works, aka John Corey.Also, there were parts of the story line that just seemed to ""hang-out"" with no closure and the text would then pick-up with a continuation of events days or weeks later with the reader left guessing just what had transpired in the interim (is this the author's methodology to limit his book's page-count?).The premise that the U.S. could be brought down by a colossal Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP) is feasible but hardly news...did anyone see the original Sci-Fi movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""?"
5,Best Book of the Best Modern Author,"This is on my top 5 list of all time...while I do concede that it is less deep and profound than Demille's other works, it far surpasses them all in terms of the pure storytelling virtues -- complexity, pacing, and unpredictability. Not to mention the numerous and creative action scenes and the deep and shifty intrigue. And his writing is just as top as in his other, more well known works."
4,Odyssey a great spy thriller,"Loved it. WAS very far-fetched and fits into the paranoia of the Russians by the U.S. during the 80's and the cold war. Liked the characters and liked how the plot came together. Different than his usual work but then again, all of DeMille's books are different and that's what makes him an interesting author."
3,Talbot Odyssey,Not as enjoyable as most DeMille books. Takes a long time to develop and ends in a swirl of activity that is exciting but too much at once.
5,It could happen again...,"The fact is that what Demille(my favorite author) writes about in this novel could indeed happen again...just add the newest technology and you have a possible match. There will unfortunately always be those who would attempt to destroy what Americans have worked so long and so hard to establish. Few other authors can gain my attention as Nelson Demille can in most all of his books(except Mayday..which was written with another friend). If you want to escape into a world which existed only a few years ago(and could easily come around again) told to you in a way only Demille can do, then try The Talbot Odyssey. If you missed this one and liked his others this will not disappoint!"
3,Plodding,I was disappointed in the pace and intrigue. Decided not to finish the book - very unusual for me and DeMille!
1,"worst book i read lately.... can this guy think, let alone write?","zzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzz zzzzzz zzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzz zzzzzzzz zzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzz z zzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzz zzzzzzz THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST SPY/BS/NONSENSE/INCOHERENT BOOKS . JUST TO REMEMBER THE NAMES OF THE THOUSANDS PEOPLE IN IT, AND THE TOTAL NONSENSE THAT PASSES FOR DIALOGUE, NOT TO MENTION THE ABSENT PLOT...... LIKE WHAT WAS IT ABOUT? WHO PUBLISHED THIS?"
2,"An early Nelson DeMille, and not a very good one","Rather like the early Robert Parker, Nelson DeMille wasn't nearly as good when he started. Or so this book indicates. It is a long, mostly tedious, spy thriller, the early parts almost kept me from finishing it. Things pick up, but it never has the zip, or for that matter the humor of the later books."
4,"A ""5 Course Meal"" - Not a ""Drive-Through""","I stumbled upon this gem after being disappointed with several previous DeMille Novels. The Talbot Odyssey is a ""thinking person's"" novel. It, much like real life, is NOT all excitement and adrenaline. DeMille does an outstanding job of character development and plot organization and development. While the crux of the plot is not an imminent threat which we face; it is entertaining and afterall this is a novel not a strategic arms treatise. This book requires tenacity from the reader and NO Page Skimming, or you'll miss the clues and hints that DeMille sews throughout the pages. If you've been disappointed with the Gold Coast and Plum Island and the Lion's Game - BUT if you liked the Charm School, Spencerville, and Word of Honor, then you will like the Talbot Odyssey."
4,"Not Shakespeare, but definetly entertaining","""The Talbot Odyssey"" is an intensely entertaining novel, that although doesn't challenge one intellectually, does present itself as more than suitable time filler. I have read all but two (""The Gold Coast"" & ""Spencerville"") of DeMille's works and he is amongst my favourite authors. His ability to immerse his novels in pertinent and often necessary historical context (i.e. ""Plum Island"" & ""By The Rivers Of Babylon"") is a strong drawcard for me. Once again, DeMille manages to capture historical mystery and mold it into a fast-paced and gripping story with all the elements that make a successful and entertaining novel."
5,Marty's opinion,"DeMille is great as usual. What a happy surprise when I found this book. I had missed it when it came out, so it was a real bonus finding it. Could not put it down. Read it by flashlight after losing power to hurricane Sandy. Just got The Panther on my kindle. Way to go Nelson."
3,Good but not great,I've read most of Nelson DeMille's books but missed this one when it came out. It's a pretty good read but there have been so many changes since it was written that make it pretty much out of date. Still reading it at this time but almost finished. I really like his more recent books better. I thouht Night Fall was one of the best books in this genre ever written.
1,countless flaws and bad logic,"have read all of demille's books, this is perhaps the worst one ever written by him. so many holes, countless flaws...the whole book just read like a poorly and blindly patched quilt. in order to give some twists to the plot and scenario, demille had thrown in so many nuts and bolts but simply failed to make all of them match or connet together properly. when you have read something happened in the former scenes, he later seemed to totally forgot what he had already written and the same situations came out almost like nobody knew it had already happened. nearly a half century's mole hunt just turned out to be more ridiculous page after page. i just wish that demille could re-read what he had written in this book and would not turn a blind eye to what he did to this lousy work-maybe the only one-by facing himself in the mirror, slapping his both cheeks for what he had done and, so poorly done. any viewer who gave high praises need to enroll in the logic 101 class pronto."
2,SCIENCE FICTION,"REMINDED ME OF A STEPHEN KING BOOK, WHERE THE 1ST HALF IS HALFWAY SANE & THE 2ND HALF GOES OFF ON A TANGENT THAT MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW. REDICULOUS BOOK."
2,Not so thrilling a thriller,"I just could not get into this book. I thought it started out very slowly and the characters were very unlikeable. There were good spots, but overall I would not recommend this book."
2,Exciting Start............Agonizing slow finish,"Story came apart about two thirds of the way through the book.The last part of the book was totally predictable.DeMille asn't what he used to be,"
5,Prescient & still valuable.,"This is a wonderful old text! The introduction by Paul Niggli, Bader's mentor, poetically and convincingly describes snow structure as analogous to rock. This amazing opening essay also includes an overview of avalanche science to date (1939) and some very odd and quaint quotations from old Swiss history books about avalanche accidents resulting from and/or leading to conflicts between ancient rival duchies. These few pages are worth the entire price.The rest of the book is great ""sport science"", with mathematical equations and graphical descriptions of mechanical snow properties like creep, deformation, settlement and layering. There are also research reports, including some wonderful old photos of metamorphism studies that explain rounding in a way words never can. Although some of the science is undoubtedly outdated, this book should be required reading for any grad student contemplating a ""new"" investigation into snow properties."
3,A review of the history of the Pharmaceutical Industry,"The book gives a good introduction to the history of the pharmaceutical industry since the early nineteenth century. I, a chemist who is interested in the industry, found the book to be easy to read, full of interesting details, and very informative. The book points out some aspects that allow new drug development possible."
5,This show is fantastic!,I absolutely LOVE this show! The dialogue is fast-paced and witty and I rewatch it from time to time because I enjoy the characters so much! I'm not really a sports fan but I'm definitely a Sports Night fan.
4,Just FIne,"Am a Sorkin fan so I liked it a lot. Arrived in reasonable time, etc. Since nobody's perfect, it gets 4 stars"
2,Not the Sports Night you remember,"This is not the version of Sports Night you watched originally on T.V. This is the syndicated version that they dubbed over with a laugh track. It is very, very disappointing.Sports Night was my first introduction into Aaron Sorkin's writing, and it was darned good. This version is distracting."
2,buyer beware,"When this show first aired on network television it was freshly original. I do not remember a laugh track. However, the dvd has added an annoying laugh track that makes it almost unwatchable. Unfortunately there is not a menu item to remove the laugh track. I had intended to buy several copies of the series as gifts. But after watching the first two episodes I decided not to. Wait for the series to come on dvd without the laugh track. It's a shame that first class television can be so easily ruined."
1,Beware Does Not Have Closed Caption!!!,Loved this show when it was on TV and loved the original 1998 boxed set -both of which are closed captioned - so I was shocked that the special 10th anniversary edition did not have closed captioning. If you need this vital feature buy the 1998 boxed set!!!
5,Wonderful,THe cancellation of this show has gone down to be recognized as the worst decision in network tv history and the perpetuation of the decline of ABCa wonderful little escape from the world
1,Warning--problems with the disk run,"I purchased this set, and there are big problems with the DVDs. The box warns you about some multi-layering problems, but it was ridiculous. It stopped for 5 seconds or so a couple of times each minutes. I spoke to Buena Vista entertainment today, and they confirmed there are problems with the disks and they are looking into it and will be in touch when they get it figured out. In the meantime, buyer beware."
4,Why no subtitles... WHY!?!?!?,"I absolutely love love love this show. I followed it while it was on the air (even though I was in junior high school) and I purchased the original DVD release when it came out. I fell in love with it again and my wife lost her Sorkin virginity. When I heard that a new anniversary edition was coming out, and from Shout Factory, I got excited. Shout Factory did a great job with the Freaks and Geeks set, so I had high expectations. I sold my old set and pre-ordered this new one. When we went to watch it we discovered that unlike the previous bare-bones release, this one does not have subtitles. I have no idea why the definitive collection of a work would choose to omit this standard feature. I cannot recommend the series highly enough, but I am disappointed by the lack of subtitles."
4,"excellent series, but be careful of the DVDs","I'm a huge fan of the show and was overjoyed that they issued it on DVD, but I've had some problems with the DVDs themselves. New out of the box, the first disc hung my high-end DVD player at 11:38 in the pilot episode everytime. I was able to play it in my Xbox and in my super cheap bedroom DVD player. They've crammed a lot of episodes on each disc and I notice a lot of encoding artifacts as a result. I doubt they'll reissue these discs with better quality, so if you are a fan of the show, you might have to accept the quality issues, but it would be nice if they dedicated more resources to the DVDs."
5,Sports Night complete set,"Even better in a format I can watch sequentially than catching it on tv a week apart. Outstanding acting and writing, can't believe this show was cancelled. Very timely and holds up even a few years later. Opening shot of the twin towers very sad. This was well worth the price, and a show I can watch over and over and catch something new--layers of writing here."
5,The best show ever!,"""Sports Night"" is easily the finest television show ever made. Even better than ""The West Wing."" If you read this review, ignore the other ones that say ""if you like sports..."" I don't happen to be into sports and I still adore this show. Sports are merely a MacGuffin for the good stuff.I have often said that Aaron Sorkin is like Shakespeare: even if you didn't understand what they just said, it's EXTREMELY fun to listen to. Money spent on this show will not be wasted."
4,Great!,"This is a great series that captures much of the greatness of the west wing. It captivates audiences with great plots and interesting characters. It has a few poor episodes such as the pilot and the end of the first season, nevertheless the majority of this series is a masterpiece. I only wish it lasted longer"
5,The Best Show On Television,"After just watching Sports Night on Comedy Central at two thirty in the morning, I was aching to watch it again. And again. When I found it'll be available in a boxed set soon, I just had to share it's excellence.Even though I watched the two seasons it aired, and have since seen the reruns repeatedly on Comedy Central, this is still fifty dollars well spent. I can't think of another show that captures so many elements so vividly; sports are there, relationships, death, loss, illness, and on and on. And after capturing all those, and watching the characters endure them, you can't help but smile when they come out the other end, for better or worse.I wish I could put the emotions that the show puts forth better in words; you just have to see, and hear, the interaction between the characters."
5,Spectacular television,"The show is an emotional rollercoaster, because in every single episode you will laugh aloud and come this close to crying. I could go on and on about how great the script is, how great the cast is, how it's underappreciated and ended in such a way that never really fully resolved a lot of loose ends......but I think it's safe to say that if you watch this show, you will care about it. You'll care so deeply you'll feel a pang of pain in your heart when you think how there never will be another episode, how this specific ensemble will never be back together, and how a show that could've been one of the greats never got out of the sophomore slump (even Cheers got 3 seasons to establish itself before getting decent ratings!).You don't need extras on this DVD, you'll be fine with the ""play all"" feature, because watching this show from end to end is the most we could ask from television."
4,Can't say enough good about the series,"Aaron Sorkin is an absolute genius! The cast had chemistry and talent oozing out of their performances. Sadly, fans will never get a new episode. (Mr. Sorkin, if you ever come across this, I would actually watch a Sports Night reunion show!)The multi-layered discs are a problem in my traditional DVD player and I plan to call the 800 number about that. However, I have discovered that I can play the DVD's in my laptop without any problems. If you have a DVD ROM, try running the discs in that."
2,"a stepping stone perhaps, but....","I bought Sports Night for 2 reasons. I was already a fan of the West Wing and Sports Night had lots of positive press. Bad move! The press is greatly overrated, with the comedy torturously predictable. It does try hard to blend drama with comedy and it covers some interesting topics and themes, but ultimately the drama is sabotaged by the less than average comedy. Whether it is the setting or simply Sorkin has improved, but the final product doesn't compare with the West Wing. It now sits half watched under my TV......DISAPPOINTED"
3,Sports Night - 10th Anniversary,"Loved the series (one of the half dozen out there evidently ... it was cancelled after two seasons), enjoyed very much the original DVD's, and also enjoying this 10th anniversary set.Would have given it a higher rating if the commentaries were easier to access ... easy to get to on a DVD player, but not so easy when it's played on a computer."
2,I don't understand it.,"I cannot understand the appeal of this show. I'm obviously in the minority with these reviews, but here's my two cents.The word ""witty"" keeps getting thrown around here. Talking really fast back and forth to each other is not wit. Restating the other person's sentence quickly in a conversation is not snappy. It's repetition. And it gets old.I do respect the effort to try something new. Most TV is garbage and new ideas are not welcomed with open arms. But this show failed for more than this reason."
2,Mildly amusing,"I caught a few episodes of this show when it aired and laughed a few times. The problem is that it could never decide whether it was a comedy or a drama. As a drama it was a complete failure. There is nothing interesting about a behind-the-scenes look at a sports network. Who cares if the lead story is ""Martinez has a no-hitter going into the 7th"" or ""Kordell Stewart demands to be traded""? As for the comedy- it consisted solely of characters exchanging sarcastic remarks. That gets pretty tedious after a while, even if the characters are somewhat attractive."
5,"Well-written, Intelligent Show","Sports Night was an amazing show that combined both a drama and a comedy into a half-hour time slot. As many have already stated, in the same episode you could be teary eyed from something sad happening, and then a few minutes later, teary eyed from a humorous line. I'm amazed at how wonderfully written this show was, and how well the chararcters were thought out. I always liked how in the tough times Isaac could always give his wisdom, and it seemed to always make things better for the staff at Sports Night.Aaron Sorkin is a brilliant writer, and I'm hoping that he'll create more new shows that can at least compare to the intelligent writing of Sports Night. Anyone looking for an entertaining, quality TV show, should definitley check out Sports Night."
5,You don't have to like sports to love this!,"Before the West Wing took off Aaron Sorkin was busy creating that same smart, fast paced style for Sports Night. This is among the best shows I've ever seen and is another one of those tragic losses in TV History: a good show that no one except me seemed to watch (e.g.,: My So Called Life).This is both a comedy and a human drama dealing in funny (and sometimes serious) ways with the mixed up lives of its characters. Smart and highly entertaining!I was counting the days until its release when I heard it was coming out! 45 Episodes in all! Sadly they don't seem to be lasting too long as it's hard to watch just one at a sitting."
5,are you kidding me?,"I don't usually do this, but I needed to raise the average from the 1 star the other guy gave it. This was the best new television show in the past five years, and ABC's plunge from first in the ratings to dead last is the karmic result of their refusal to give a well-written, thoughtful (not to mention Regis-free) show the chance to succeed. If you like the West Wing for its well-developed characters and witty dialogue, you'll like this one too (it's the same guy)."
3,"Great show, bad discs","I would argue to my dying breath that this was the most intelligently written half-hour show that has been on television since M*A*S*H. If you loved it before, you will fall in love with it all over again when you realize just how much you missed it.Having said that, the peple that brought it to DVD should be publicly flogged. The laugh track is annoying (I don't need to be reminded that this is a funny show), but the worst part is that the disks skip repeatedly. I'm not sure why they skip, but I suspect it is as a result of pushing too many episodes onto each disk. At first I thought it was my player, but after trying it on three different players of three brands that were each less than a year old I am forced to conclude it is a product flaw.The show never compromised its integrity by ""dumbing down"" to the general public, so why did the producers of the box set compromise the quality to hit a price point?"
5,Awesome series!,"Another great series by Aaron Sorkin! The laugh track was annoying at first, but they got rid of it after a while. Good series! Wish there were more seasons :)"
4,Where Sorkin Perfected His Style,"I loved this show when it first aired, but it was really interesting to rent and watch again post West Wing. I think the show still holds up, although I don't love the laugh track on there, mostly because it isn't needed. And there are some serious pacing issues on the dialog and storyline. But this is still a wonderful show with rich characters. It has that fast paced Sorkin feel, and I love the sports center feel. Oh how I wish this show had ran longer than it did!"
5,addition by subtraction,"i love 'SPORTS NIGHT.'pretty much everything that can be said has been said about this ground breaking show.personally, one of the things i found extremely entertaining about it was that MARTIN SHEEN wasn't in it.that guy's a SNOOZE FEST!"
5,I wish the show lasted longer than 2 seasons!,"One of the funniest shows I've ever watched. It has great fast paced humor and a great cast with amazing chemistry. I only wish that Sorkin could have continued to write Sports Night along with West Wing. I think many people thought that it was a real sports show, when it is actually a show about a show about sports. Each character has their own sarcastic charm and the banter between them is hilarious. Mostly comedic, but the show has it's serious points, but no drama that causes that annoying soap opera feel. I highly recommend anybody who wants a good laugh to watch at least a few episodes, and I'm sure you will want to watch the whole series."
5,Two seasons weren't enough.,"Aaron Sorkin can do no wrong on TV, though sadly the American viewer doesn't seem to be smart enough to appreciate him. I will never call this show an equal to the West Wing, but it really isn't trying to be. The characters are professional sports fans and they realize fully that they are not in the business of preserving democracy. But for all the escapism that sports entails, the show reminds us that at sports are also about human excellence. The characters themselves know it and they see their jobs as making sure their viewers remember it too. They don't speak like anyone I've ever met, many come off as neurotic from time-to-time, and they never seem to go anywhere besides the studio or the bar downstairs, but I love watching them all the same. The box set is marred only by its brevity and the occasional ill-conceived laugh track."
4,Just an all around great show,"Many people missed this show while it was actually on the air, but critics agree it's one of the best shows on television in quite some time. Its fast paced and impossible witty banter is simply a joy to watch, and sportsfans and laymen alike should love the set-up and nuances shown in each 30 minute episode. My only problem is the poorly place laugh-track, which seems there only to tell the average viewer ""HEY! This part is supposed to be funny!"" If you don't get it, don't watch it. But if you do, get ready to laugh non-stop and be in awe of the people who wrote this thing."
5,I'll add my enthusiastic recommendation,I too loved this short-lived series and highly recommend that you give it a look. Characters I still miss months after I last saw the show.
4,Great show. Video quality could be better,"Sports Night is a great show, but the video quality on these dvds could be a lot better considering the show isn't that old.The dvd extras aren't anything special. So I doubt the 10th Anniversary is an improvement over the original release (but I haven't seen that one to be certain)."
3,The seventh victim (1943),"[...]Despite the unusually short running time, this morbid low-budget suspense story moves very leisurely. Not much really happens at the placid, almost somnambulist pace – and still they manage to fit in some unnecessary stuff!The combination of incongruous intrigue, noirish atmosphere, and muted melancholy creates an eerie enjoyability, though. Maybe in my book."
4,Man's Rise to Civilization: The Cultural Ascent of the Indians of North America,"Before reading this book, I had little knowledge about the Indians on this continent. This book is well written and very interesting. He goes into detail about their living situations, relationships within each group and with other groups, their governing, families, work ethics, etc. It should be required reading for history majors."
3,It is worth $20!,"When i first heard that Bungie was making an expansion pack for Halo 2, i was in awe because not only would it be the first expansion pack for an xbox game, secondly its Halo 2 and thats awesome. Ok as far as gameplay bungie again delivers a masterpiece, it enhances a great multiplayer game. It adds more options in multiplayer as well as more game variants in each of the new 9 stages of play. You get to experice the thrill of trashtalking your opponent in a whole new way online. The things that made Halo 2 a great game to play are that the first player shooter is amazing and secondly that the multiplayer is what brought people together to play a game many people call Halo 2. The new stages are to much to explain in full detail and besides someone already did it in these reviews. Take my word of advice or dont take it, this game is worth $20 because it adds on to a great game experience."
1,Halo 2 - GOOD; Halo 2 MMP - VERY RHETORICAL,"Well, it's been about a year and a half since our beloved game came out, and it's been about half a year since this ""expansion"" came out. I believe this is a total ripoff unless you do not have Xbox Live. ALL of these maps are currently FREE on Xbox Live. No fees. Yes, all nine maps. Free.This is also a rip with our new friend: ""The Halo Triple Pack"" which includes this disc. The pack is $50, but you can buy Halo 2 for $20, Halo: CE for $10 at the most, and these maps are free on Live.I just don't get why this is still as much as it is. You'd think that one would use these maps more on Xbox Live, but they're free there, so why buy this at all? To give Bungie and Microsoft spare change.Bottom line:These maps are available free. Why buy them for $20?"
4,Breathing new life,"I bought this disc barely a week after it came out, and if I was impressed then, I am really impressed now. Why? This little wonder retains its value. I initally only liked Turf and Warlock, as my wife and I did not have XBox Live at the time, and most of these maps are designed for HUGE battles, especially Relic and Containment. I still groan when some maps come up (Gemini and Backwash, for example), but this is a matter of personal preference.Overall, these map great enhance and expand the already-perfect Halo 2 Online experience. Get it."
4,New Maps are a success!,"The new maps are great. They provide a good mix of sizes and strategy changes. There are some bigger maps (relic, terminal, containment) which provide good big team objective battles, medium mpas (backwash, turf, sanctuary, gemini), and smaller intense maps (warlock, elongation). My personal favorite is Backwash because it reminds me of the 343 guilty spark level from the 1st Halo, but all the maps have good redeeming qualities. Elongation is awesome for an all out rocket match.Overall, these maps are worth the buy. BUT, if you are a live subscriber BUY THEM ONLINE, NOT IN STORES! You can download turf, santuary, warlock, and containment for free, and get the other 5 maps for $11.99. You end up saving about 8 bucks."
5,Jerry Vale- Same Old Moon,"I love this album . it brings back so many memories of my childhood. Everything on it is crystal clear and the music brings back the old style of love songs.I would recommend it to anyone who loves Tony Bennet, Perry Como, Andy Williams and the like."
5,one of my favorites,i have heard so many songs in my life but this is one of the best song ever. i am surprise it wasnt in the chart . this is the hardest song to find . thanks amazon.com
2,Missing Her Best,"This compilation is okay, but it concentrates on her '60s slick Nashville years. Missing are the country greats: Happy Happy Birthday, Have You Ever Been Lonely, Making Believe, Lonely Weekends, Today I Started Loving You Again, Seven Lonely Days, Reckless Love Affair, The Box That It Came In, I Cried Again, These Empty Arms, Since I Met You Baby, You Win Again, etc...With this many omissions, it can hardly be considered ""The Very Best Of The Country years."""
1,I agree,"I completely agree! I ordered the Stealth Fighter for my husband for Christmas and had no idea the base was not included. It is very frustrating when companies falsify ads just to get you to buy and then hit you with a ""Oh, you have to pay $100 for the base (batteries) to make your new toy work plus more shipping cost"". Talk about being pissed. I have no problem with the amount of money but why not sell it as a set with all ornaments and not just a dorky globe?"
2,Frame needed glue! Not well made,"The frame is a standard two sided picture frame. Nothing fancy. You slip the two pictures (all it will hold) in from the side. Unfortunately, the dowel connectors are not quite fat enough to hold the side of the frame, so I had to add so elmers glue.Too bad it is not a two sided (or one sided) digital picture frame -- that would be really cool."
2,Nothing to say,"Definitely this is not my type of book, it has 230 pages and if you take off all the woods descriptions, castle descriptions etc. you will find a book of 50 pages or less. The main story, The queen of Sheba, is the less you read and parts of the story definitely are not true at all, of course I was not there to confirm what is true and what is false."
4,Wind From The Carolinas,This tale brings historical fiction as close to classic fiction as anything I can think of. The story follows the exodus of American Loyalists from the Carolinas just prior to the Revolution to the Bahamas and Barbados. It spans several generations and involves multiracial elements. It's a great read.
3,Historically Relevant,"As an enthusiastic student of history, I enjoyed this story of a fictional family of loyalists that left the states during the Revolutionary War and settled in the Bahamas from a historical point of view, but I agree with the reviewer who said there isn't enough character development in the story - at least not for me. I think it's a good story, but it could have been better."
5,This is a great read,"This is one that you want to savor and read again and again. Well written, it evokes the sights and smells of the South and Caribbean in the early days. You hate to see the characters grow old and things change as Wilder weaves you into the lives you are loathed to leave. I will keep this one close, to reread often."
5,A Marvelous Story That Runs Through Generations,"The book is BIG, but is easy reading, and the characters soon seem more like friends. You'll find yourself continually referring to the family tree.I bought my book at a Daytona Beach flea market for 10 cents. The price on the cover of this 1964 Bantam Book is $1.95. But it's well worth todays price!Thank you Robert Wilder (1901-1974) for one of the best books ever written!"
2,Sudoku with little imagination,The product is very poorly designed. It can not use the native resolution and uses very low resolution and grabs all the screen. The aesthetic is very poor and they need to use darker lines to separate each groups of 3 X 3 squares. The color of pre-determined numbers and your entry should be completely different from each other. This product is obsolete. Don't buy it.
5,Good starter book,"I really enjoyed this book. I am newly diagnosed and had alot of unanswered questions that I didn't know who to ask about. I did the main research in the internet, but that just gave me the bascis. This book gave me all the answers to all the questions I had and the questions I didn't even think about.It was very easy to read. (I finished it in 1 1/2 days, that's how good it is) and very straight to the point. My mother is now reading it to better understand my new diagnosis and the rest of my family are as well. A def. MUST for all new to this diease. Good luck to all in the same battle and STAY POSITIVE!! :-)"
5,Good starter reference,This book was very helpful in the first months after my MS diagnosis. It is a good general look as common questions and answers that every patient and their families have when trying to learn about the condition.
5,This is the ultimate MS reference,"When I was newly diagnosed 2 years ago, my fiancee and I were completely shocked and did not even know what MS was.We started reading books and I purchased probably around $200.00 in books at the time, hoping to get a thorough understanding of this, and this book was one of them.This book was the best to outline as well as the least intimidating of all of those books. And it was probably the thinnest too! Granted, it did not cover every single detail of MS, it gave us enough information to at least feel somewhat comfortable again, knowing more about what I would be dealing with.I highly recommend this book to anyone newly diagnosed, or to loved ones, or even people who have had it a while and need a refresher or just a good overview because they never quite got it in the broad sense. I am still passing it around to family, and have gotten nothing but good reviews on it, not to mention it has helped me not to answer so many questions!"
5,MS questions and answers,This book came in so handy for both my son who has MS and myself. It answered so many questions and gave us a better understanding of this disease. I highly recommend this book for the newly diagnosed and their families.
5,Great Book for dog lovers,"This was a great short book, which made me recollect all the great memories with dogs in my life since childhood. I would definitely recommend the book to keep in mind the people and animals that are important to us, and how we often get bogged down by stresses that don't affect man's best friend. Glad to support a fellow Cape Codder."
2,Quick route to know what is up with Harry,If you have read the books this book is a waste of time. It mostly sums up the plot and characters and so forth. If you have not read the books and do not have time to have any fun -- since reading the books is lots of fun -- then this is a quick way to find out what is going on.
4,Good!,"This is my first tablet, so I'm not sure how it compares to others, but I like it. It's easy enough to use that my kids enjoy drawing in photoshop with it. The mouse quit working after a month, but I didn't really use it anyway. I think it's a good product for the money."
5,"Un ""Sung"" Stories review","This CD shows how exceptional a talent Phil Alvin truly is. Overshadowed by his brother Dave in the Blasters, Phil comes out to play on this disc. His vocals are as strong as ever as he leads Sun Ra & The Arkestra and The Dirty Dozen Brass Band through 10 dynamic songs. A must for any true fan of either Phil or The Blasters."
2,Teen girl review,"I bought this series to watch with my mom.The first three were good so we stretched it out and watched two every few days. Well lets just say after the third episode it was inappropriate! This blond girl sits up and is naked!! I was soo upset then Eclair the main star of the show, they show her bare behind! This show is for girls so why do the girls run around naked? IF you are a parent do not get this for your child. It be a good show if they keep it clean but that is not happening.I also will mention that there is blood in this show and it gets more bloody in the next set I saw the preview on this dvd. But I do have another suggestion try The Cat Returns movie from studio ghibli instead. The cat retuns is clean adults and children will love that movie."
2,Same old amine plot lines,"Don't waste your money on this series. I found the plot very predictable and boring. It follows a random storyline with nothing to really tie it together. Series has very dry humor. Provides the obligitory fan service, but with this series, that is not enough."
2,Listen to my two cents,"This was not worth my time. I love watching informational, newsworthy dvd's. However, Meth in the City was sooo lame/boring at best. I was hoping to geta better look into a person's life with more personal interviews. Instead of hearing about it from public and private officials. Due to the fact that itis about the price of a matinee, it gets a two rating. Other than that, I could have watched this crap on Fronline or something."
3,easy drawing book,delivery took longer than i expected but for the very cheap price of purchasing this book used it was worth the purchase. I would of never paid full price for this product but used for less than a $2 the book was well worth it.
5,funny faces brought many smiles...,entertained my 10 year old nephew for hours as made faces for everyone he knew...
3,Helpful Biography,"If you're looking for a detailed biography of the life of this Hollywood couple, this book is not for you. This is a short read that will give you an idea of what Gable & Lombard's relationship was like, and offers a brief glimpse into the lives of each. For an in-depth view into the two stars' lives, I recommend separate biographies for each, instead of this book which is only good for the merely interested reader."
5,My favorite book,"A fun-to-read book especially if you admire Carole Lombard like I do. She died before I was born, but I think she is the woman I most admire and look to as a hero"
4,easy to use,"So far i havent had any problems. The VCR works and the DVD plays DVD and CD's and MP3's just perfectly.I havent tryed a DVD-R yet but I doubt I will have a problem with it. The remote is pretty easy to use, compared to other combos i have used.And the clock sets automaticaly if you have the right set up, I dont but doing it manually was easy.I didnt give it 5 stars because it wont let you play MP3's randomly or make a play list. It only lets you do random and play lists with normal CD's."
1,I agree - the DVD side is junk!,Mine worked fine for about 8 months and then suddenly the DVD side stopped working. It can't read any DVDs. But the VCR side works fine. I would not recommend this product at all!
2,"vcr good, dvd horrible","i owned this unit for 6 months and everything worked fine. then the dvd player started to malfunction. no matter what disc was put into it, it would not read it. i called panasonic customer service, tried what they suggested (2 different calls each with a different service rep telling me to try different solutions), but it still would not read any discs and continues not to read any discs over a year after purchasing it. forget about getting it repaired. it costs half the price of the unit just to have someone look at it to see whats wrong. the vcr portion works great, just like all the previous panasonic vcr's i've owned. i guess panasonic just knows how to make good vcr's and can't handle manufacturing dvd players."
2,DISAPPOINTED BY PANASONIC,"Bought at Xmas. To warranty repair of VHS ejection in January.March: Tried one DVD and it worked. Tried a second and it told me it couldn't read it! It's supposd to read Region 1 discs (which this one is). Try to figure out what's wrong? Tried website, which refused to recognize my model number.Called Customer Service. First time, I held on for an hour, and it cut me off, unanswered by humans. Second time, 45 minutes before I got a human. Then he tells me it reads Region 1 discs.""Not mine"" I say. He says ""Read your manual"" and hangs up.My product stinks, but you may get one that works. If it doesn't,forget about telephone help. Sorry I bought it. Very sorry."
1,"Panansonic used to be a ""Trusted"" name","I purchased 2 of these (1- to replace a VCR and 1- to put in a new RV). I picked these simply like others, to have them for the VCR and DVD capability. But most importantly I picked these because they had the ""Panasonic"" name and I trusted in that. Do yourself a favor and ""DO NOT"" buy these pieces of junk!!! I won't go into details because everybody else has written what goes wrong and they are right on the money! Panasonic, you and your fabulous customer service branch has just lost a customer!!!"
1,Computer Guru,"As others have said, do not buy this product. The DVD player skips a lot, requiring you to take the DVD out and then replay and search for the place where you left off. The unit power is now dead and I will be depositing the product in the garbage pail. I guess I should be lucky because it lasted about 4 years."
1,pretty bad,"I have had this unit for over a year, and have barely used the DVD player. After watching about two to three DVDs, it stopped reading discs. It only works as a VCR, and although it does function, even that is not so convenient. When playing back tapes, when you forward or rewind, it overshoots where you want to stop and continue playing by so much, it's very difficult to forward through commercials etc. It keeps forwarding for 30 seconds worth of tape when you try to stop it while reviewing, and if you are fast rewinding or forwarding, it will overshoot by 5 minutes. Other units do not behave this way. The main problem is that it never worked right for DVDs. Cannot recommend."
2,worked great for about 8 months,"Easy to install and use, worked fine for about 8 months, and then completely died. Not really worth the money, unless you need something to hold you over for 8 months for some reason. If so, then go for it. Otherwise, I'd look at other options."
2,a nice quick read,"growing up together in the same house, almost raised as sister and brother, who would have thought that all this mess wouldve come out of it? sandra brown, thats who! while i didnt really like this book, it wasnt bad. nice to fill the day with, but on to bigger and better things"
3,Sandra Brown is definitely one of the best!,"This is just a typical 2 hr., feel good read. Not one of her bests but always enjoyable."
4,I Couldn't Get Enough!,"Brown has given us a very sweet story in LED ASTRAY! It is about a religious family with one ""good"" son and one ""bad"" son. Both sons love the same girl. The characters truly care about one another and it was a pleasure to read their interactions. There was a nice, long courtship where the reader got to know them more and I enjoyed it very much.The story is well developed and has likeable primary and secondary characters. You won't want to skip a single word in this book, in fact, you'll reread some parts! I was tired of the love/hate romances I've been reading lately, it was a delight to pick up this book. I kept waiting for it to get stupid, but it didn't. I was pleasantly surprised.Another worth-reading romance by Brown is SUNNY CHANDLER'S RETURN."
4,Wonderful Read!,"Hal and Jenny are to be married. There are some things standing in their way. Hal is going off on a mercy mission and Hal's brother Cage is in love with Jenny. Jenny thinks of seducing Hal so he would not leave only to find out it was not Hal who she made love to in the dark but his brother Cage. So starts this very intriguing love story of love lost and found. Will Jenny ever feel the same way for Cage? and will he admit to what he has done. Very touching, sad and wonderful. Excellent Read!."
4,"Would have given 5 stars, but.......",This story was absolutely incredible. I listened to this one on CD and I was so anxious to get into my car to hear the rest of the story every day! I absolutely loved the storyline. It was great.The only reason I gave it 4 instead of five is because I thought they could have tied it up in a little prettier of a package. I had two many un answered questions that could have been beautifully answered with one more chapter.But still one of my favorites.....
1,Painful to listen to,"I rely on audiobooks to get me thru my long commute. I had never read any of Sandra Brown's novels and was hoping this book would be the first of many since I like reading through an authors entire work. I was totally disapointed. The plot was weak, the characters unbelievable..... All of the action cliche and laughable. Jenny does not realize she is making love to the black sheepbrother instead of the fiance. COme on... The brothers were not twins.... The grandparents rejecting the grandchild of their most beloved son.....all in the name of Christian values....My 15 year old daughter and I forced ourselves to listen thru to the end as we thought there has to be some twist that happens = no such luck."
4,I really enjoyed this book!,"I was pleasantly surprised when reading this book. The main characters, Cage & Jenny, have great chemistry and the book keeps you engaged the whole time. I have to admit I was a little annoyed by Cage's thought process on telling Jenny the truth about something that is pivotal to the plot but otherwise I thought it was a well written book and worth my time."
4,A 20 year old story that was entertaining!,"Although written some time ago, this is yet another Sandra Brown novel that is quick and easy to read. Here is the plot made simple: bad boy/daredevil (Cage, who is often misunderstood and harshly judged) + good son/religious zealot/martyr (Hal, who is following in his father's footsteps to be a minister) + beautiful/orphaned/virginal woman (Jenny) + hypocritical parents + forbidden love (both brothers love the same woman) + death (good son dies) + secret (Bad boy slept with good girl pretending to be brother)+ fast car (I let that one slip) + near disaster + pregnancy = a great/entertaining story."
3,A great book that ended too fast,"I love all Sandra brown books!! And this one was just as good, until (there's always an ""until"") I got to the end.She finished the book in a way that had me wondering. There were no details to how the problems were solved, they just were. Everything was condensed into a 5 page epilouge, it just needed more.(At least in my opinion)"
1,Not worth your time,"I got this book on audio cd for a long car ride, and I couldn't stop laughing. Maybe it's because it's over 20 years old and the writing is full of cliche's...or maybe because the guy reading it sounded like someone's grandfather with a mouth full of dentures. It made listening to the love scenes pretty funny. I don't think this book stands the test of time. The main character Jenny is annoying. She's naive to the point of stupidity. I'd recommend Karen Robards for romance books. Even her early work from the early 80s is still relatible."
1,I must have missed something,"I listen to many audio books, novels and non-fiction alike. This is one of the rare books that I removed from my car's CD player before it ended. I thought it was dreadful. The whole premise was how Cage (what a stupid name) was going to get into Jenny's pants (again). Jenny didn't know it was not her fiance but her fiance's brother who she made passionate love to in the darkness? Come on! And of course she gets pregnant the very first time - also very realistic.I'm not going to waste any more time on this review. The book just isn't worth it."
5,The writtings of Phillip Keller are easy to understand .,"The book containing all 4 of Phillip Keller's writtings is a winner for preachers that need that extra little something in studying.His down to earth manner of speaking makes the book come to life before your eyes.As your read ,you can almost see the actions unfold.You can almost hear the cry of the wayward sheep.I have found the book most useful in preparing sermons about the 23rd Psalm and even now am using it to bring some very powerful sermons dealing with the parable of the sower found in Matthew 13. Even while studying for these sermons I found myself in a place of humility because of the way certain aspects of life are overlooked.I would recomend the book to all of my fellow pastors. It is space saving and very well priced.tbneal"
5,HIGHLY INSPIRATIONAL,"This has got to absolutely be one of the best books I have ever read. What a pity that it is no longer available, except by searching for a used copy. Phillip Keller opens grand new vistas regarding what consitutes a really good shepherd and what being a ""sheep"" is all about. Many portions of both the Old and New Testament are much more meaningful to me now. I would read this book before I went to bed. It was like drinking a glass of the finest wine. Very inspirational and highly recommended."
5,WHAT A GREAT PURCHASE,THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY GREAT I LOVE THEM AND EVERYONE COMPLIMENT'S ME ALL THE TIME ON THEM....
5,20 Time Life Country Songs for driving cross country,"Road Songs / Classic Country series / Time Life single CD: These may not all be ""Classic"" Country songs but this CD is a must-have addition to your glove box.Five Stars---------------------A little info on the Time Life Country Classics:Time Life has single CDs under the title of ""Best of Classic Country"" divided into decades so there is a single CD under that name for the ""50's"", ""60's"", ""70's"" and ""80's"".Time Life also has many single CDs under the general term of ""Country Classics"". These titles include:- Kings of Country- Queens of Country- God, Family, Country- Road songs- Great Story Songs- More Great Story Songs- Crazy Country Hits- Sweet Country Ballads- Honky Tonk Heroes- Great Country Gospeland several (many many) more titles. These disks are all very good to great, but there is a lot of songs that are repeated from one disk to another."
2,I just use the brush of this pen,"I own this product for almost an year. I use only brush of this pen as it is effective in removing any dust from the lens.I stopped using the lens cleaning part because over the period of time, whenever I use it on my lens, it leaves slight black smudges on the lens element which I have to end up cleaning some wet method.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Useless,"What else can be said?Useless. Do yourself a favor and invest in a lens cleaning kit with a brush and lens cleaning papers. While some ""Lens Pen"" type products seem to work well from reviews, this one was a total waste of money."
1,Big Disappointment,"I ordered two Lens Pens to keep in the different bags, and I avoided buying the generic ones for the quality of the Nikon brand.. The disappointment was the black residue the cleaning tip left on my hand (picture added), which lead me to avoid using it on my lenses."
1,Waste of money,"Good thing it cost under ten dollars...this is one product you won't like. It didn't clean my camera lense, it just smudged it up. Better off using a regular cleaning cloth or lens wipes."
3,Not very effective,"I am pretty new to the SLR world (5 months), but it does not seem that this pen does a great job. I followed the instructions and it removes most of the dust (maybe I am expecting more that it can deliver). What I like about it is the size: it fits right into the side pocket of my camera backpack. It is probably produced by the same company that produces a no name version, but it is probably a challenge to find a same quality device without the same price tag. Anyway, if you had spent at least 1000 bucks on your camera system so far, you can spend another 10-20 in this quick cleaning device."
5,Great Accessory,I take pictures in a woodshop so I nneded somethig to remove fine dust and wood particles from the surface of my lenses. This product works very well for that purpose.
3,"It Works Pretty Good, BUT this other model is better..","Good idea and design, but Targus has one almost identical EXCEPT it has the retractable brush on one side and a cap you remove on the other side that covers a small spay nozzle. It comes filled with cleaning solution and a cleaning cloth.Sometimes a brush just won't get off the fingerprints, the Targus TGK-LPC just seems a lot more versatile and effective..The Targus pen is available at Radio Shack for $4.99 as well as tons of online stores."
5,Very useful! Must buy!,Now I don't have to worry about the dust on my lens. This product is very easy to use. And it works great. It's a must buy for photographers.
5,Love the brush,"Camera manual says to use a blower (so I bought one), but the brush takes up less space and seems to work better (had one for years now). I'd only use the BLOWER on the inside of the camera but for the lens and outside of the body I like the brush."
2,disappointing,"The tip leaves many streaks on my polarizer lens. Seems to work fine on other surfaces, but still. There's got to be a better product out there."
2,Not too happy with this one,If you aren't quick enough to wipe the lens this leaves the lens smeary and streaked. I get better results with microfiber cloth and water.
2,Fell apart after a few uses,"The first few times I used this, it was great, but I just pulled it out after about a month of not using it, and the spongy pad thing crumbled apart as I tried to use it. When I inspected it with my fingertip, it left black smudges on my skin. The brush end is fine, I guess."
5,Awesome!!!,Saved one of my expensive laser pointers...Just with they had one a 6th of the size to fix my other one. Highly recommend.
2,Just get wipes.,"As far as I can tell, it doesn't actually clean off any oils, like fingerprints. It just smears them around..."
4,Nikon does it again,"I have used this item many times on camcorders, binocs, and of coarse the many lenses that I possess. This thing does the job from removing smudges to stubborn water marks. I recommend to shop Internet for best price, can very a great deal. Amazon was my choice."
3,Nikon Lens Pen Cleaning System,"Tried to use this on a very sensitive lens and the pad at the end left little smudge marks. They were easily removed with lens cleaner, but this was not the best buy for my needs. Great idea though."
4,Very Handy Tool,Nikon Lens Pen Cleaning SystemThis is a very handy & easy to use tool. I do wish there was a cover of some sort for the brush end.
2,Cheap,The bristles on the brush started falling out on the first use. What good is a brush that leaves more debris than ti removes? The cleaning pad side did nothing. It didn't seem to have any cleaner on it and just made the smudges on my lens bigger.
3,Works well enough,"Works well enough, but feels cheap. I've used it a few times now and its effective and clearing away dust from the lens."
4,Neat little tool!,"I like this pen because it's compact and has a great little brush attachment. The other end is used for cleaning smudges off of the lens, but I found it's just better to use the spray for smudges. All in all, it still helps me clean off dust and tiny smudges in a compact case."
4,Works great!,The pen works great for cleaning my lenses. It was shipped in a timely manner and does exactly what they said it would do. I would recommend it to anyone interested in one!
1,"Don't bother - get a ""LensPen Lens Cleaning System"" instead","This ""Nikon 7072"" lens pen is a 100% replica of the item ""LensPEN Lens Cleaning System"" which is sold here on Amazon also. It's so much the same that the general wording on the package and the plastic flashing on the product is 100% the same. I would save yourself $2 and get the other one - they are clearly made by the exact same company."
1,set off airport security explosives alarm,"seemed like a great product until I went through airport security at Reagan Airport.Set off explosives alarm twice, detained until they narrowed it down to the pen...I got on the plane finally....they kept the pen."
1,Not exactly as I thought,"I used it a couple of times, not exactly that useful. I'm not sure whether all of them are like this or just the one I bought. Its just too dry, and twisting the cap doesnt help either. I'm not using it anymore, scared it might scratch the lens.."
5,Exceeded expectations,I recently purchased a Nikon 24-70 and 2 filters (ND and CPL). I needed something to keep my glass clean so I bought 2 of these. It works really well and easy to use! I'm so happy with this product. Highly recommended.
4,Good product for the price.,Read a lot of reviews concerning the black carbon dust. I tried on the pen on a regular camera lens before touching my expensive ones. Worked great.
2,Not durable for travel,"This thing does the trick as far as cleaning lenses, however the cap didn't make it thru a 10 day trip to Africa. It no longer will ""snap"" into place and so there is risk that the powder gets out and onto everything else."
2,Leaves smears; brush loses hairs,"The pad leaves behind greasy black smudges, the brush loses hair. After 'cleaning' your lens is dirtier than before, and you need a microfiber cleaning cloth to remove the smudges. A very disappointing product from Nikon."
2,Underwhelming,"Although I had high hopes that I could carry this cleaning tool with me during my hikes, I've since decided that it's almost worthless. The main cleaning ""tip"" is too large to reach the oculars of my Nikon binoculars (nice going, Nikon!). And although I can use it to clean other lenses (objectives, camera), the results are uneven and unimpressive. As a long term Nikon user, I'm very disappointed that they've put their name on a product that's as mediocre as this one. Surely there's a better alternative for a compact cleaning kit that I can carry in the field! I certainly won't buy another one of these."
5,"A good ""throw it in a bag"" accessory","Of course, this is not world's the most sophisticated lens cleaning system. However, it is one very handy package that takes very little room in your bag and works with reliable and predictable results. I would not use this pen to clean lens that was subjected to what would be considered heavy levels of dirt, but it works well, cleaning those occasional smudges that you get on the lens when a 3-year old decides to touch lens with his finger or a droplet of water dries on the lens."
4,Quick cleaning tool,It works prety good specially when you want to clean a small spot on your lens just when you are about to shoot. It's very convenient and easy to carry on.Be carefull of not pulling brush hairs as they will come off quite easy and will start losing other hairs from then on.
4,As advertised,Not a catchy headline but hey its a lens pen. I bought this primarily to get the dander off of my camera due to a skin condition. But the lens glass cleaning end really does a good job of getting water spots off of the lens where a cloth cannot reach. A good investment for such a small amount of money in my opinion.
4,Lens Cleaner,This product is good for on the spot field cleaning. I would not recommend that this be your primary lens cleaning set up. It will work well at removing dust from the surface of the lens and can remove a smug. Nice compact design that takes up little space in my camera bag.
3,Great Product...But $ Has Almost TRIPLED Since Dec 2006,"This product works well and it is amazingly compact! Great for anyone who's camera bag has limited space. It really does clean; and better than the old fashioned lens paper and liquid, which may ruin the lens coatings on modern day lenses.I bought it last year for around $9, dropped to around $8 just a couple months back, and now that I need a new one over the holidays in 12/06 for my other camera bags, it's price almost TRIPLED to $22!The product deserves 5-stars, but... because its price jumped so drastically and almost TRIPLED since Christmas 2006...I am giving it 3-stars! Why Amazon/Nikon!!!???"
3,does the job,"the pen is great for cleaning lenses, but do not make the mistake of using this to dust off the inside of the camera. Will create more mess than there was to begin with."
4,Nice and handy lens cleaner,This is a nice and handy lens pen you can keep in your pocket or bag. I bought two for both. Works well but does collect dust on the brush because they are open to the air and does not have a cap covering them like the other end of the pen. The price is right but Nikon needs to put a little more thought into keeping th brush cleaner.
5,Niffty Little device,"This is a niffty little lens cleaning device that has a bunch of uses around the house, what with all our electronic devices and their lens and screens."
5,Call Me Clueless,"Apparently this product has been on the market for some time, but I was clueless to it being available. In a word: EXCELLENT. Very effective. Sure beats dragging a cloth across a high quality lens."
4,mhm,great if you need to clean your lens in a hurry. but the felt end leaves black marks on you if you touch it which kind of gets annoying. great buy though.
4,Perfet for taking with you,"This product is perfect to have in your back, since it is small and pretty effective. Although for a better cleaning, I'd ratter get a better one."
5,Handy pen cleaning tool,"I bought this because it was compact and easliy fit in my camera bag. Have not used it yet, but it appears to be quality and will do the job intended."
2,cheap cheap cheap,"After using the cleaning system there are often dust like particle on the lens, you can see it on the lens. What's the point of a cleaning system if it leave behind so much dust? Not useful at all."
3,Works ok...,"Overall the product is just 'ok'. I've used this on my camera lenses and binocular's and each time, when there was a smudge, it would just smear it across and I would just grab a cloth to clean up the smudge...BUT it did make the 'smudge' easier to just wipe off and does not harm my lens'."
2,"A good brush, but the pen itself doesn't work very well","I got the Nikon lens pen for my camera lenses, based on the positive reviews. The overall design is compact, and I like the retractable brush. However, the pen itself is not very effective at cleaning glass. The tip is shaped like a suction pad. Rubbing it repeatedly over smudges or residue does gradually start to remove them, but it's much slower and less effective than a microfiber cloth. In some cases the lens pen also leaves behind a light streaking, which is again easily removed by a microfiber cloth.I think I'll keep the lens pen for its retractable brush, but in retrospect it would have been better to get a standalone brush."
2,Half good,"I love the brush portion of this item. I photograph on the beach a lot, and it gets the sand out well. But the cleaning pad on the other side smudges my lens instead of cleaning it. It leaves black smudges, making it worse off than before I cleaned it."
4,works fine,"I used it on a trip to egypt and it did it's job, though it was hard to get one smudge that my baby son left on the lens. Much rubbing later, it came off."
1,Nikon...But horrible quality.,Felt tip fell off after a few uses. Sent it in for a replacement but was returned with the same pen with another tip glued on.
1,Useless item,"The "" Cleaning Head"" will leave a light and uneven grey film on the lens. The brush is not well protected. It can trap dirt even it is retracted. Do not waste your money on it."
1,JUNK!,"I bought this because I was told that it was a great product. The first time I used it, it scratched my lens. I then had to send my camera back to Nikon to get it repaired! That cost me almost $200.00! I threw the pen away!"
4,Nikon Lens Pen Cleaning System - Sure Beats Cleaning Your Lens With Tissue,Bought this because I never had much success with the lens cleaning tissues. Works much better. Could also use a larger tip.
5,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. THE POWDERED CLEANER TAKES OFF ANY SMUDGE OR SMEAR. EXTREMELY EASY YTO USE, AND IT'S MUCH MORE COVVENTIENT THAN THE OLD STANDBY."
5,Nikon Cleaning Pen,"The functionality of this cleaning pen is 10 out of 10. It is simple to use, easy to carry and pack, and takes up little space. It works."
1,Covered in Specks,"I was very excited to receive this today as my lens has been a bit smudgy. After reading the package, I eagerly cleaned my camera only to find it MUCH MUCH dirtier than when I started. More smudges, LOTS of tiny specks all over and even one of the hairs from the retractable brush.Will NOT use again.Complete waste of money."
3,Quick Cleaning,So far I've only had occasion to use the brush end of this nice little acessory. It works well and keeps the dust to a minimum.
1,WARNING: Smears lenses with black,"I don't know if it is dry-rotted or if they're all this way, but the cleaning tip not only leaves black pieces of suede or whatever it is made of, but leaves black streaks anywhere you use it. I rubbed my finger across it, and my skin was stained black. Returning immediately."
3,ehhh... it's ok,"It is a nice little pen but my only problem with it is that when I tried to use the suction part, it left a big black circle of something on my lense. And then on my nose."
1,Bad Joke?,"The product packaging opened easily enough; maybe too easy. Brush side of the pen looked like a brush-too soft, too coarse, whatever. The other side of pen however left a black residue when I touched it to my knuckle. Yes, black like a Sharpie and hard to wash away with soap and water after dotting the back of my hand in repeated disbelief. Has to product tampering. Too bad."
2,Tip fell apart on first use,"The brush is good, but (very big but) the felt tip on the smudge eliminator side fell off on the first use. The glue used to adhere it to the rest of the pen was wonky. Possibly just a manufacturing problem."
2,Good way to scratch your lenses,"I am surprised Nikon offers this item. If used VERY carefully you can use the brush to remove dust - but - don't try to wipe the surface of your glass with this device unless it is brand new, as grit can and will get in there and produce fine scratches on the surface of your expensive lens if you are the least bit careless. Better to not get your lens dirty in the first place. Barring that, there is a much better way to properly clean a lens that involves rolling tissue that you can find on the internet that costs nothing and can prevent scratches while removing even severe grime."
3,Nice but lacking,"I was looking for a good pocket lens cleaner for my DSLR. This does an okay job but more often then not I have to use something else. If it is simply a matter of dust, this is the perfect tool.It is a little massive for a pocket but still a great item to carry for that quick dust off and get back to shooting.Don't choose this as your only path for lens cleaning when out on a shoot."
4,Very good....,It works! Sometimes the brush itself gets dirty but it isn't bad. It cleaned my lenses well. Great quality.
5,Buy it..,"Bought one more than a year ago...then bought a cheaper one, never thought there would be much difference. Wrong...Nikon quality is excellent. Whether you are a Canon user or Nikon user, get this. Cleans quickly and leaves no streaks..a lifesaver when out on the road. Just bought 2 more."
4,It Works!,"does what it claims to do and does it well.Only one concern. After about a few month, the cap doesn't really click to secure in place. It's kind of closes it but loosely, sometimes it will just slip out."
4,"Easy to use, portable lens cleaning solution","I needed something easy to clean the occasional smudges off my lenses and this was the right solution for me.I pack this in my camera bag when I go out, just in case I need a little touch up. It's the size of a fat pen and is very light so it doesn't weigh you down.The good:- Lightweight and portable.- Easy to use.- Effective cleaner.The bad:- Sometimes, it doesn't clean the first go around so it can take a few tries.- The brush end is not covered. It is stored inside the body of the barrel with the end exposed so I worry about dust or other particles getting onto the bristles and potentially scratching my lenses when I use the brush. The cleaning end does have a cover but I think both ends should be covered. As a quick fix, I carry this in a small zip lock bag just in case.All in all, I'm happy with this product but would be happier if the brush end had a cap to prevent dust/particles from getting in."
4,Excellent integration,"Very useful, lowcost, well integrated & easy to carry. Not sure how lasting it is."
4,Must have Lens Pen,"With a soft, retractable cleaning brush to wisk dust away at one end and a lens cleaner tip on the other end, this is a really good, practical product for the person who is serious about his or her photography. Plus it can be carried in a camera bag with no appreciable difference in weight, or in a shirt pocket.When I bought it from Amazon in December '08, it was listed at $7.99, so it appears to have gone up a few cents in price. I can tell you that I saw this pen for $6.50 at WalMart just yesterday, June 24th '09.Price not withstanding, you need this pen. I bought it; I use it; now you go buy it."
2,Not that great,"The retractable brush is OK, but the ""cleaning tip"" is just a tiny disc (about the size of a paper-punch hole) of soft cloth, mounted on a rubber tip. It did clean the lens reasonably well, but I would think it would get dirty pretty quickly, and there is no way to clean it or replace it. And in my case, I won't care, since it fell off after a few uses (yes, I was treating it gently and not using any solvents).I think there are much better choices available, unless all you want is the retractable brush."
1,Not Worth the Money,"Nikon Lens Pen Cleaning SystemThe brush works as advertised, but the other end is rubbish. I've ordered two pens and both came with the same defect: The foam tip is lodged in the pen cap. The remaining part of the tip is felt-like, but is covered in black stuff. Good thing I tested on my hand first when I didn't notice the issue with the foam. I would have gotten black schmutz all over my lens!"
1,NO STAR! It smears the lens! What junk!!,This POS smears the lens when I tried cleaning with it. Pressing it down on a white paper it leaves a black ring smudge. It's junk! I can't leave less than one star or I would.
1,Worthless,"Dry tip, ineffective. I figured it would have had to have some kind of wet solution inside it to wash smudges. All this thing does is smear the dry black gunk that comprises the polishing tip. I got no benefit out of this item whatsoever."
3,never used,"bought for my d40, but havent used. may come in handy in the future.. i'll update post if i use."
2,Doesn't really do what it claims,"It sort of works, but not very well. It doesn't clean the lens particularly well, the ""moist tip"" isn't moist, or is so minimally moist that I can't detect it. The best thing about it is that it is very compact and easily fits in a camera bag. As a cleaning system, it's not really worth anything. Even for free."
4,No brainer,"Small, easy to throw into the camera bag. The brush is quite good. Pen end is usually effective, but sometimes doesn't remove smudges as well as my pre-moistened lens cloths."
3,not for me,"I regret making this purchase and using the item on my lens. The only thing it cleans well is my filter, which looks spotless afterwards. However, it does a terrible job with my lens. Who would have thought that a brush could leave lint? There is lint residue from both the cloth and the brush. The brush hairs also fall off easily, and I think the brush itself might have left a slight 1mm mark on my lens. I don't think it would affect my pictures, but just seeing the inefficiency of this item makes me wish I had just purchased something else instead. I might just have to get an air blaster now."
3,Nikon 7072 Lens Pen Cleaning System,"When I got this Lens Pen Cleaning System, I tried to use it to clean my D5100 lens and the LCD screen. Fibers kept losing from the pen and stuck onto the lens and LCD. It was not a good experience."
3,Works for me!,Nikon lens cleaning pen works great for me. I generally use it in one or two months on my 18-55mm VR lens. Good product.
5,Works great,"This pen fits easily into the camera bag. I bought it mostly for the brush, in order to get any debris out of the crevices and around the lens during regular maintainence."
5,"Very nice - small, convenient and easy to use","This is one of those little items that make you wonder why it took so long to come out. Rather than fiddling with cleaning clothes that always seem to trap everything but the dust on your lens, this is a quick, convenient way to reach exactly where needed. Takes minimal space and is right where you need it when needed. Very satisified!"
5,Excellent for In Field Use,"Of course the lens pen won't replace thorough cleaning, it is the best thing I've ever had for use while out, actively taking pictures. It's simple, compact, easy to carry and there's zero trash or clothes to use. The cleaning end is self replenishing and the brush end is soft enough to be safe, but still strong enough to brush beach sand away safely. I love it!"
4,Magic Smudge and Dust Eraser,"This is a handy tool. It is pretty compact (not much larger than a highlighter/magic marker), has a built in clip(so you can securly place it in hip or breastpocket). And it does a great job of removing incidental finger and water smudges from your precvious lens with an extruded endpiece that looks to be covered with some microfiber material. And you simply ""erase"" the marks. Simple as that.It also comes with a retractable brush that can be used to quicky wisk off any dust particles around the edges or creases of the camera/lens.Highly recommneded to anyone with a camera to keep that lens clean and producing the best shots you are capable of."
5,Works Great,Product works just as described. Cleans the lens very well. If you have anything with a lens in it...this thing works great.
4,Great Space Saver,"I really like this despite some of the other reviews that the cleaning pad is too small. I use it to clean my camera lenses and I find that it does a better than average job. I'm only cleaning off lint, dust and smudges however, and I use a large lint free cloth first if the lens is unusually dirty. This is a quick and easy way to clean minor lens artifacts. I give it four stars for not having a replaceable pad."
4,Pretty good product.,"Nice product at a good price. The only thing I wish it had is that the brush part, when it retracted, was covered. Other than that, no complaints."
5,"Great tool, inexpensive and nice form factor","I have several similar digital lens cleaners, and they're all decent. This is nice because it's a bit heftier in girth, with a slightly larger-than-others contact surface and with its size making it easy to dig out of a camera bag or a pocket. Good value for an essential photography tool."
5,great product,"this is an amazing product! cleaning optical glass was a pain until this item came along. eyeglasses, camera lenses, binoculars, spotting scopes, etc. are much easier to maintain now. i've been using one for about a year, and it is far and away the easiest and most effective solution currently available for removing fingerprints from optical glass. it truly works! while anyone could conceivably get a defective item, if you have trouble using the Lens Pen, visit their website and view the instructional video."
4,Nikon LensPen,This item has been great so far. Works good for cleaning the lens. I bought 2 more to give as gifts.
4,Works great!,"It works well and does exactly what it says. It is nice that it is not liquid as I have found that even liquid cleaners will still leave residue behind. Even microfibers are prone to absorbing your fingers oils and transferring them to the lens. I personally do not like even using microfibers more than once or so. The best way to keep that glass nice is to use a filter whether it be UV, colored, or clear, using a filter is the best way to keep your glass safe.FYI Carbon Black is a known carcinogen. It is often used in the production of rubber for tires. It enhances the properties of natural rubber as well as other synthetic rubbers. It is as black as black can be and comes in a very fine powder. I have never heard of it being used for cleaning purposes but it seems to work well so I can argue. Just don't sniff the pen."
5,cleans almost perfectly,"it works great and after the brush, I used the flat part on the back and that was amazing actually"
3,So So,"Good buy compared to the ones at Best Buy, Too bad it is only a dry cleaning tool, kind of expected a cleaning solution."
3,Shipped Filthy Dirty,"I bought this item as a gift to myself in December and was excited to own something compact and contained, as opposed to my microfiber cloth I was using. While I enjoy the brush to remove debris from my various DSLR lenses, the other end came filthy black and turns everything it touches black including my lens, clothing, and skin. Obviously defeats the intended purpose of this item. Looking through the reviews I am not the only person this has happened to. Just a heads up to those considering purchasing."
4,SCI-FI DVD is good show.,I watched it is good show but there is no closed caption for Deaf Community whom cannot hear it speak/voice. I keep to be reading the actors lip's moving that I understood some but mostly is not because of I'm Deaf person. I believed it is violation law of America with Disabilities Act (ADA) said that it must be providing the closed caption on its DVD for Deaf or Hearing-Impartial is accessing.
1,"Jason and the ... bad actors, bad sets, bad storylines!","Okay, I wanted to like this. I really did. I'm an old Sci-Fi geek from way, way back. Given how long ago this was filmed, I didn't expect big movie effects, or expensive sets, or even great acting. But, I did expect something that was at least watchable. And, I did try to watch it. I truly did. But, good gravy! After three episodes of each of these sets, I had to say ""enough""! I gave them each a shot, but they were so awful!!! A talking monkey? Seriously? Why? And, the kid with the bushy eyebrows. What was THAT all about? It was just too much of a really bad thing, folks. Waste your money if you wish. I'm going to try and sell my sets on eBay!"
4,Filmation = Fantastic!,"I picked up this boxed set at a used book store and absolutely loved it! I vaguely remembered watching one or two of the shows in each series as a kid, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a fun trip down memory lane reliving the episodes I remembered and enjoying the episodes I didn't. With all the animation crap out there posing as Saturday morning television, this boxed set is a great reminder of why kids used to get up on Saturday mornings!"
3,a bit of a disappointment,"I remember these show from when I was a kid; it seems there were more episodes than what is included here, these were very low budget and in some instances seem to push a message that may be a little tilted I didn't see it watching them as a child but as an adult the theme seems a little clearer but the acting was fair and the price was right so if you have memories of these shows or are a general Science fiction fan they are ok shows."
3,Mixed feelings.,"Like many long time Dragon Ball fans out there, I've had mixed feelings about DB Kai as a whole. I would say if you've not experienced the original animation then this is a good place to start loving the show (especially for those whose attention is rather short). It cuts out large sections of what some have dubbed ""filler"" to try and copy the original set-up of the manga more closely. And this is my main problem with the concept of Kai in general. I love the anime as it originally came out just as I love the manga as it originally was. They are two separate pieces of art not really made to be a perfect copy of each other. That said, I will give credit where it is do for the updated musical score, and must say I am looking forward to when they release the OST for Kai here in the States. Though I would also caution here that some of the music has become more ""upbeat"" where it once might have had a darker key-set to it."
5,my favorite,"I have several MoTab CDs. this one is my favorite. I have one for home,one for the car and now one on my kindle."
5,Let Virtue Be a Guide to Thee,Valuable book to have in any needleworker's collection. Fantastic pictures and the information is detailed and complete. A hard to fine book.
3,pretty good,It's a little annoying having a different speaker in each ear. I usually ended up listening to one or the other.
1,So what's new?,Another Christ-basher with the message that J.C. was a liar and fraud. I read and enjoyed Dr. Muller's _The Three Big Bangs_ however. He should stick to science and leave his personal biases out of his books. Phhht.
4,A new look at the life and message of Jesus.,"This book tells the story of Jesus' life from a fresh perspective, that of someone familiar with the art of magic tricks, which should prove stimulating and illuminating for most readers. The author demystifies the Gospel events of the life of Jesus, which increases the impact of Jesus' new message."
1,People will find what they wish to find,"""Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance. The only thing it cannot be is moderately important."" C.S. Lewis"
3,"Has the LaVryle flavor, but not her best work.....","I only discovered LaVryle Spencer in the last few months and enjoyed so much the first book I read that I was reading one after another in quick succession. I have come to the end of her books because I know she doesn't write anymore and I will miss her work. I have enjoyed all of them except for one clunker (in my opinion) called Sweet Memories. Many of her books I have given 5 stars; she just knows how to capture the essence of family life, of romance, of everyday situations with that special touch. I would put this book around 3.5 stars. It was good, but certainly not her best, but it had the signature Spencer ingredients of lost love, family conflicts, resolution, and happy ending. In that respect it doesn't disappoint, but I wish she had made the book a little bit longer and provided more character development on the main characters."
3,Good but not great...(3 1/2 stars),"The Hellion was an ok book. Tommy Lee and Rachel were involved long ago, but after a 24 year separation, they are reunited. The writing was decent and the story was ok, but I just didnt like the characters all that much. Tommy Lee wasnt too bad, but I found his huge behavioral changes to be somewhat unbelievable. As for Rachel, I just didnt really like her. She came across as a bit of a snob and I felt like it was obvious that Tommy Lee loved Rachel much more than she loved him. Not bad, but not a keeper. Still, it is worth reading especially if you are a real fan of Spencer."
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"I hate to say this because I really like Lavyrle Spencer. I think that she's one of the best and I'm sad that she no longer writes. However, this book stunk. I don't know any other way of saying it. The book was way too predictible. I really couldn't get into it. There was nothing original about it."
4,Wrong volume!,I also ordered thinking I was getting 'volume 1' as it was not specified in the listing. Amazon definetly needs to clarify the situation in multi-volume sets.
4,Wrong volume,"I ordered volume 1, but this is volume 2. Amazon needs to correct this situation, as it has happened to others as well. Will have to order directly from JLCbooks"
2,JLC Field Guid to Residential Construction.,"I would assume that the Field Guide would be good, however, I don't know as the wrong book was sent to me. I was sent volume 2, and I ordered volume 1. I sent an email regarding the mistake and have heard nothing."
1,Stay away!,This Samsung LCD TV has an unbelieveable poor picture quality. It took only 10 minutes to decide to return the item.Actually 5 lemons and no star!
4,The Way Theory Should Be,"This book is unique in that it presents a huge mass of scholarly material and is extremely readable at the same time. The way this is accomplished is that the development of theories are addressed through the history of their development. It's amazing to see a topic like this comprehensively treated in an almost narrative manner. Aside from the enjoyability of the read, you get the benefit of learning two things at once: (1) The Theoretical Bases of Indo-European Linguistics, and (2) the history of the scholars and their work (or how (1) got that way). Essential for anyone interested in IE Linguistics or the history of scholarship (bonus if you're interested in both)."
2,Less than that,"I absolutely agree with Eldana. I would rather give the original version 10 stars. The beauty of the original song is lost somewhere in the trance version. When I bought the CD, I was hoping to hear a dance version of an already beautiful song. Disappointing!"
5,Excellent source for Elementary drama & socialization skills,"I work as a Art Focus Drama teacher for K-7 students who come from various socio-economic backgrounds and home lives. I found this book a very valuable resource, especially for students who have a difficult time with issues of trust, language, and ensemble work. It is great to have a resource that contains detailed exercises within a logical framework, that not only works, but explains itself in a manner that even classroom teachers, with no drama experience whatsoever, can accomplish.A highly suggest this for teachers who want to use drama as a way to improve communication and explore problem solving in a new, creative, and very effective way."
4,Book Review - Unearthing Seeds of Fire: The Idea of Highland,"Unearthing Seeds of Fire is a thorough historical account of Highlander Folk School and the life of its founder Myles Horton. For any involved in adult education, as well as those interested in education through social movement, this book provides rich descriptions of the ideology, context, and philosophy of creating learning communities through collectivism. The author is particularly successful at painting a vivid picture of the sociopolitical atmosphere under which Horton created Highlander, describing the successes and failures that were realized over the years, as well as the organic evolution of the school as it responded to the changing needs of its students. Although it provides extensive academic references, any individual interested in the education and leadership of adults will find it understandable and inspiring to read."
5,My top choice for acoustic,"As a guitarist who's had the opportunity to work at Guitar Center (back in 1999), trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task. While I'll chose D'Addario EXL's for electric, Martin SP are my top choice for acoustic. The sound and reliability are unmatched for the money. They also have a neat bronze shimmer to them... Granted that's only aesthetic."
2,Augh!,I purchased the product about 3 days ago. I give it a star for being the fastest shipment I've ever had. I'm pretty sure that the strings would have been great if I had the other three strings! I only recieved three! I need six to play music! I'm very unsatisfied with the product. Maybe next time.
3,C.Stewart,"This book talks about engagement by age group, which is a good topic but when reading into futher...its saying all age groups want the same things; flexible work arrangements, good pay and benefits. Nothing new in this book."
4,Great insight,"Ken Dychtwald covers greatly the changes in today's workforce. From diversity to age, it all effects the shortage of skills and talent. This is a great book for anyone who owns, manages or plans on opening a small business.Mieko Banjoko"
5,Thought Inspiring,"I have just completed reading this book and I have never been struck with such awe in my life. If there is a book that you must read, this is the one. The secrets that were once lost are given to us once again through Mary. Each point made is just mind-numbing. Please, do the universe a favour and read this book. Twice."
4,The Love Song of the Universe,"This book was very enlighting to me because I have had some of the same experiences that Mary had. Never had I met or heard of anyone who had these experiences. I am grateful she decided to put these things in writing, and how fortunate I am to have read it."
4,"quick read, great story","A tale of a brilliant doctor/scientist who is newly married to a woman who is perfect, almost. His quest to ""cure"" her of a birthmark leads to a predictable end, and is a forceful commentary on society and the concept of beauty being more than skin deep."
2,ok but thinner than I expected,I am a little disappointed in how thin the material is and the sizing seems on the small size I would probably order up IF I were to reorder - which I will not. I am finding most of my fav old clothing manufacturers are all following this trend towards crapulance...
5,great biking shorts,"They fit great. Very comfortable, although a little short. Priced right. I would buy more of these when I need more."
4,"Buen zapato, buen precio, duraderos en la cancha.","Es un zapato confortable, a un buen precio y muy resistente en la cancha. Tal vez le falta un poco de estilo pero cumplen muy bien su funcion. Los recomiendo."
3,Great suction!,"Works perfectly. The power lock suction really works! Once you engage the suction cups, this thing does NOT come off. It also holds a lot of stuff. I am able to put my sponge scrubber wand in the long tube side, and in the shallow side I put my brillo scrubber, my sink plug, a regular scrub brush AND then drape my dish rag over top. Talk about clearing up the sink clutter--I LOVE this! I just bought a second one for my mom.UPDATE:I've been using this for a few months now, and the ""power lock"" hasn't been working for the last month or so. Also, last night when I took it off of the sink to clean the sink around it, one of the plastic pins that holds the suction cup on broke off or fell out. Anyway, it's gone, and now the item is completely useless. It worked great while it worked, but it sure didn't last long."
1,Disappointed,The suction cups are set too deeply within a plastic cap and do not adhere to the side of the sink-a real disappointment.
4,Could not put it Down!!,"I wanted to read it before I the movie came out on video. I was so mesmorized I had a difficult time going to bed. I also am having a difficult time drinking my tap water! I was quite disturbed by the verdicts, and feel therewas a lot more that could have been done! I truly feel that this book was written impartially and the way that Mr Harr decided to go was quite thought out and fair. He did not paint a rosy picture, just because he was writing more form the perspective of the Woburn families: he on the other hand gave a honest look into the way a trial is handled from the beginning, giving the reader the best seat! I would advise reading before the movie as I have been told it is a bit different."
2,Overlong and dull courtroom drama . . .,"After hearing the novel was to be filmed by Steve 'Schindler's List' Zaillan starring John Travolta, Robert Duvall and Kathy Bates, I went straight out and bought it. I was surprised to find that this 'epic' novel was too epic and seemed overlong by the middle. What this book isn't is a legal epic, what it is - it's little more than your average John Grishman novel. Cheesy and cliched."
5,Good but many victims not mentioned here,"This book details a set of families fighting to pursue justice but this was actually begun with a group of families led by attorney Michael Gatta in the 1960s in Woburn.In addition there is a man name Ken Grant who was driven into banruptcy,homelessness and joblessness when this book came out. His bank accoutns were tampered with at Fleet bank while the IRS had accounts at that bank as well as IRS audits and levies without notice. Headhunters throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire refused to get him jobs while references burned him. All this started when this book came out.Grant was out of work for a very long time. Prior to this book none of this happened.Scores of Woburn townspeople experienced perceptual motor damage from the water. This is a good book but a host of others should follow."
5,A civil Action puts you in the middle of the action.,"From page one I could not put this book down. After reading most of the books on legal pursuits I would have to say this is the best. Instead of watching the story, I was living the story. If you could read only one book...make it A Civil Action."
5,A brilliant book.,"Few authors capture both the emotional drama and factual events involved in a major test of the legal system as Harr does in this superior book. The strength of his research and interviewing is present on every page, and every citizen interested in how our laws-- and the humans who are responsible for their administration--work should read A Civil Action. Harr's characterizations humanize the numerous individuals involved in a major lawsuit, without romanticization. This is a magnificent work of importance to anybody who cares about our judicial system."
1,huh?,"when it says ""epic courtroom drama"" on the cover and is about a lawyer almost losing everything for a case, you sort of expect a battle between good and evil, but this is very disappointing, this is a battle between evil and evil. lawyers and judges. this is an interesting story about a lot of greed and a few bad judgements. epic? no, not at all."
2,"I found this book to be slow, tangential, and dull...","I have difficulty understanding the capaciity of the american public to keep this boring book on the new york time's best seller list for so long. it is poorly laid out, with the first part of the trial taking up several hundered pages, and the second part taking up under fifty. I found the ending of this book to be miserably dissappointing... despite the fact that its a work of non-fiction and is bound to the truth of the story, at least to some extent... perhaps the person who ought be held most responsible for this tedious novel is not Harr, who does write with some distict clarity of prose, but Schlichtmann, who's outcome in the story is... well... booring! oh well... check out john grisham or something... dont waste your time on this one."
4,The Ripple Effect,"Wr Grace has essentially been a holding company ;Grace Cryovac, the division involved in this case, made shrink wrap and catered to the food service industry.Grace Construction made asbestos products.Both divisions became embroiled in major costly controversies which flowed back to the generic parent holding company.Another facet to this case is to bring light to the concern of the U.S. legal system as contingent on financial resources of the litigating parties. In business as in our own lives, plaintiffs or defendants can rise or fall with financial capacity, which brings the outcome not to a measure of justice but of wealth.Who said the scales of justice are not tipped?"
5,Great book for the concerned reader...,"A Civil Action is a compelling read for anyone. For me, as a law school student and one-time resident of Woburn, MA, the book had special significance. It puts our legal system into perspective and allows us to reflect on both its wonders and its failings. Justice was not served on the residents of Woburn, but this book makes an excellent attempt to explain why not and what happened on the way."
4,excellent characterization and page-turning suspense,"it reads like fiction, highest praise for me. The characters are lifelike, idiosyncratic, and sympathetic. Without seeming to, the author gives us deep insights into scientific testimony, courtroom procedure, and the fact that going to law school doesn't make anyone a successful lawyer without hard work,personal charisma, and shrewd interpersonal skills. Read, learn, and enjoy!"
3,Read the book...,"The book of same title is really a good read - especially for someone interested in legal civil procedure and the ways of the system. The movie while not outright bad, far more than pales by comparison."
5,First time I stayed up pass midnight to finish a book.,This book reaches a level of description rarely seen before. The set of facts described in the book take you through a set of situations that make you empathize with the main character right from the start. And it is only when you empathize with the character that you find the real joy of this reading.
2,COULD'T GET INTO THE BOOK,"I GREW UP IN WOBURN AND LIVED IN THE CLUSTER AREA. I PLAYED WITH SOME OF THE KIDS WHEN I WAS SMALL. IT WAS VERY HARD TO READ ABOUT WHAT YOU LIVED THROUGH. I ALSO LOST SOME FAMILY TO CANCER, BUT NOT TO LEUKIEMA. I STILL THINK THE WATER WAS THE CAUSE. I HOPE WE ALL LEARN FROM THIS!THANK-YOU"
2,No John Grisham,"Jan Schlichtmann a lawyer to whom money isn't important! Yeah Right. Anyway, I listened to this audio book and found it to be slow, and fairly uninteresting. It certainly made me thankful that I didn't waste my money on the movie version of this book.If you like legal fiction, don't waste your time or money on this book. Stick with John Grisham and if you have this book, please don't insult Mr. Grisham by placing it on the same shelf as any of his.Mr. Harr, sorry but this was my first and most likely my last of yours."
5,A Legal Thriller?,"This is one of the best non-fiction books I've read in a long time. It was just as thrilling as any Grisham novel, as informative as a text book and extremely well written. I watched the movis a couple years ago and new the basic premise of the story, but Harr does a marvelous job of building momentum throughout the book and I could not stop reading the book at night. It was just too exciting. There was excellent information about legal work, environmental catastrophes and the greater Boston area (for which I will admit a certain fondness). I learned a lot from the novel and got excited about the law, which is not an easy feat. I would recommend this book to anyone, but aspiring lawyers, environmentalists and people interested in dramas will be particularly fascinated. I cannot recommend this book highly enough--it is well worth the purchase price."
5,A Real Picture of the Courtroom,"For all of the Grisham and Turow fans (of which I'm one), this book gives a realistic image of a major lawsuit. The glamour and glitz is there, but so are the thousands of hours spent in the library or in depos. As they say, real life makes the best dramas, and this is one of the most engaging books I've read (I couldn't put it down until I finished, 4 a.m., and missed 1/2 day of work). The prose is intricate and picturesque, yet not a slow read at all. Like most good books, there is a hollowness in you when you finish, as if you've been taken out of one reality and placed back in your own. The relation to Capote in the cover is right on."
5,Riveting Research Writing,"A Civil Action has all of the components of an excellent novel - riveting, interesting, comprised of good guys and bad guys (innocent victims and chronic polluters). What makes this book even more remarkable is that ""A Civil Action"" is actually a research project -- it is thoroughly and completely researched, scientific, credible, and actual truth, written by a researcher that had the good luck to have been able to be with the book's subjects during most of the story.I could not put the book down for days. I missed sleep, read it during lunch hours, etc. ""A Civil Action"" is appropriate for clean-water activists, for research writers (to see first-hand you can actually write fasinating research products), and for those in general who like non-fiction books."
3,Interesting!,"""A Civil Action"" was a very interesting book because it showed me what really goes on in a real investigation. I, personally, thought it was boring at times but it my attention just enough that it made me want to keep reading it."
5,Outstanding! Truth really is better than fiction.,"I assign this book to my legal environment class taught in the College of Business at Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois. The text is a slice of the judicial system brought to the readers through the suffering of famalies who lost children. Whatever your level of legal expertise, you will love this book. The real question here is ""who really wins""? Read this book! It is a rich text loaded with food for thought for all America."
1,Dry - full of facts with 1-D characters,"The story itself was interesting, but the book was full of facts and had little character. I didn't respect Schlichtmann any more for risking his career and that of his partners for this difficult case. A tragedy, yes, but I could have gotten this factual information from a newspaper."
1,A civil action,"six pages missing, back cover bent, so frusterated threw out my book. Will not be back EVER ! Mr. Devan."
1,Booorrrrinnnngggg.,"A snooze, for those of us who really don't much care whether blah-be-de-blah sued blah-be-de-blah and blah-be-de-blah got a directed verdict, etc., etc. Confirms that lawyers are sleazy, and care about one thing, their wallets."
1,I've never read such a book that drags as much as this,"A Civil Action, although the true story itself is interesting, really did not need to be a 500 page book. I could have gotten the facts from an article in the newspaper or a magazine. I don't understand why such a boring book is considered to be so infamous. I couldn't even finish it and I was supposed to for a class. Two thumbs down."
1,Literary Migraine,"'A Civil Action' is right up there with 'Frankenstein' and 'Invisible Man' as some of the worst books I have ever read. Although the first 100 pages or so are slightly interesting, the plot from there on stays the same. If you have to read this for an assignment, as I have, I would suggest that you do yourself a favor and read the Cliffnotes."
4,Linkage?,Tom Kiley is the lawyer Jan Schlictmann eventually worked for and now represents former Senate President William Bulger.. Is there linkage between these events and the Bulger case? Many of the major players hail from the general area around Woburn and Boston....
2,Desperately needs graphical editing,"I bought this book, having purchased Nabu's reprint of Franz Boas' _Kwakiutl: An Illustrative Sketch_, which is a beautiful, clear, first-rate reprint of the original.Unfortunately, the reprint of Hall's work is greatly inferior. The print is so faint as to be illegible in many places, and instead of editing out the (usually visible) page edges and expanding the size of the reprinted page to approximate the size of the paper on which the reprint is done, we are left with tiny print and two-inch margins (!) on each page. It seems to be a scan from a lousy photocopy.Much of the book is simply unreadable and so I can't recommend it in its present form. It would be easy enough to edit out the page edges and to expand the printed text to match the new page size. If Nabu wants me to spend the time to do so, I would be happy to play around with it."
2,"Boring, boring, boring.","If you want to fall asleep, this is the book. Lifeless explanations, unclear steps in exercises, akward download process for getting images from the web. Some of them not downloadable, and some have missing layers when they are supposed to have them for the exercise. I like to read Photoshop books, even though they are technical, i like to consult them quickly, but also read them like a book, but this one...i can't get over 2 or 3 pages!! The book is thorough, but i think the process of consulting it should be more atractive and stimulating, with eyecatching titles, headers, arrows, etc.I have become a big fan of Deke McClelland. I recommend buying his books if you want to enjoy what you read."
1,The worst mappping software that I own.,"While this software installed easily on my iMacG5, the map data CD's zoom and travel very slowly. Also no roads are named and routing is rudimentary at best. My dvd rom also burnt the yellow dye off the first data CD I put in the machine. None of these things has ever happened with my other mapping software. One could get better and more detailed mapping info online for free than with this. Finally, when the zoom is eventually accomplished, it is not at a very close scale. All in all, a very disappointing product."
1,don't waste your money,"Don't bother with this - I don't know how they managed to get the National Geographic name on this product. It's almost as if someone said ""Let's scan a whole bunch of maps from USGS and put the worst interface in the world on the program.""Google maps and Google Earth have better maps, better road detail, and a better interface. Plus they have satellite photos. And they are free!Don't waste your money. If i could rate it 0 or negative I would since it uses time and money and gives nothing in return."
1,Don't Buy,Could not believe that this product is from Nat. Geo. It is so badThere is no detail whatsoever. Delorme Topo is way way by far betterDo not wast your money on this as I did.
2,Topo not exactly,My husband was looking for a topo program for the Adirondacks. Not exactly what he wanted. Ended up returning the product. Topography on this program is very basic.
1,Cheating specs,"When I bought this the scale quoted for detail on the maps was the same for the state product as it was for the national product... so I bough the naional product. Now I've installed it and - SURPRISE! - when you click to zoom in, it takes you to a Nat Geo web site that asks you to buy the state map! The road I live on is NOT EVEN on the map."
4,Excellent Maps!!,"I gave the Back Roads Explorer Computer Program as a gift, and he loved it! It really is perfect for the outdoorsman/fisherman/hunter/hiker who is interested in TOPO maps, elevation, and location. It also has a ton of ""extras"" like route planners, flag labels to list where you've been or where you're going, and upload capability for personal photos and notes. Maps are easy to download on your GPS system, too!"
1,SHOES SLIP OFF,"Not for sneakers, mens shoes, or anything without a heel. The slant on the rack is too steep and shoes slip off."
4,Works great with a little cheap modification,"I was restricted as to the height of the shoe rack I could use and this rack fit the bill. Yes, it is chrome, so it is slick if you are storing shoes with no heel (tennis shoes, house shoes, etc.) No big deal - just made a trip to the local RV dealer and picked up a small sheet of gritted non-slip material that is sold for RV steps. Cut a few strips about 1/2 inch wide, applied them to the rack in just a few minutes and now shoes never slip off! (Could have probably found non-slip material it at a hardware store.) Very pleased with how wide this little rack extends and the height is perfect for our needs. Come to think of it, could probably just rough up the top of the bars a little with sand paper and get the same effect. For the cheap price, I didn't mind putting a few minutes effort in it. I'm very satisfied with the purchase."
3,Not for boots or kids shoes..,"A nice little shoe rack, but not for big boots, tennis shoes or small shoes (kids)I can't fit my tennis shoes on the bottom rack and they are NOT HUGE SHOES, there is just not enough space between the top and bottom row."
4,shoe rack,The shoe rack is fine. Good product for the price. I know there are better (read more expensive and elaborate) shoe racks on the market but this suits my needs just fine. Looks like it will hold up better than plastic ones.
2,shoes slip off the rack all the time,"The bars of the shoe rack form a slanted surface. When you put your shoes on it, they tend to slip off. This is not a good product and I do not like it."
1,"Two-Tier Shoe Rack, Chrome","This was the worse product I've ever purchased from Amazon. My son put the shoe rack together for me and I thought the rack was going to hold my shoes like the one I purchased from Amazon more than 3 years ago for my son. None of my shoes stay on the rack. As soon as you add your shoes they just slide off the rack back on the floor. The older shoe rack I have, the rods that hold the shoes are much more sturdy than the plastic rods on this product. If I could give minus stars for this purchase I DEFINITELY would. It's not worth the money the seller is charging for this item. Too bad I cannot send it back to Amazon because I would pay money to send this piece of junk back to Amazon to get a refund. I definitely NO NOT recommend this rack to anyone!!!"
2,Shoes fall off,"Rack is expandable and does hold a lot of shoes. The problem is that if the shoes are not heels, they fall off every time you bump the rack or take another pair of shoes off. The slant from the front rail to the back rail is too steep for the shoes to stay on. I'm looking for a different rack now because I'm tired of picking up my shoes off the floor."
4,"Good, simple shoe rack","This is a great shoe rack for the price. It's really easy to set up and adjust the length. Slippers and other flat pairs of shoes can even fit easily underneath the rack. It has plastic pieces to go over the ends so it will not slide around much or scratch your floor.However, there are some things to beware of:-this shoe rack actually fits 5 to 10 pairs of shoes (depending on the length), NOT 6 to 12.-boots or taller (hi-top) shoes will only fit on the top tier of the rack.-if a pair of shoes does not have a pronounced heel or if it has a flat sole, it may slip off the rackOverall, definitely a good buy."
1,useless product,"bars are smooth and slant down, you have to very carefully place each shoe on the rack just right, but the shoes still keep sliding down due to the slant."
1,Stupid Americans,Americans are stupid and the most impure race in the history of mankind. They are full of diseases and using the Nazi symbol by Anericans is a disgrace to Hitler. Go read history and Im sure these people in America have little knowledge about Hitler and swastika.
1,I don't get the point!,I struggled to make it through the book. The authors' idea of justice vs. mercy was interesting but the story was so tedious to get through that I didn't really get the point! I was disappointed.
5,Good Book!,"I love this book. It is really interesting. Everybody in my family who has read it also really likes it. It is a good fiction book. I expected to be quite boring but it is actually one of my favorites. By the way, this may seem like i am lying, but i'm not, i know the authers!! They are in the same city as us!"
5,Great knife set!,This knife set blows my previous set out of the water! I love the different knives and with daily use over the past 6 months these things still cut like day 1!
4,Too soon to give 5 Stars,"The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that I haven't owned them long enough to see spotting or cracking due to washing in a dish washer. I don't plan to machine wash, but accidents can happen. That aside, they look great, they have a great weight and feel when using, they are extremely sharp and I'm proud to have them on my counter top."
3,Spots on my Knives,"I read all the reviews on these knives and I also did my research on consumer reports and I have to admit these knives live up to their reputation in terms of their look, feel, and sharpness.Previous reviewers mentioned how the handles cracked whenever you put these knives through a heated dry cycle in a dishwasher, so I only wash these knives on the air-dry cycle. This isn't that big of a problem, even though it leaves all my dishes and glasses a bit spotty coming out of the dishwasher, because my dishwasher is an old P.O.S.. The problem is spots are beginning to form on my knives, spots very much resembling rust. This isn't supposed to happen to stainless steel, but I assure you I have scrubbed these knives to try and rid them of the brownish spotting and I haven't had any luck yet."
4,Good Value on OXO Good Grips Professional 14-piece Knife Block Set,The OXO Good Grips Professional 14-piece Knife Block Set that I purchased for my wife for Christmas appears to be a very good value. The knives are very sharp and do work well. The only concern I would have is there are two spots in the block for additional knives and I am unsure what knives actually go into those spots. Why would the knive offer not include a complete set to fill the block?
5,Great,"I love the fact that I did not spend $300+ on these knives, they are really sharp and have a great feel (handle)."
5,Even better than expected,"After reading the reviews, I expected a good knife set. Great looking, great for use, well made, the price is right. What more need be said?"
4,"Nice set, value priced.","For what you get you can't beat the price, the handles feel good in my hands, everything is super sharp, and the good quality wooden block holds it all. Only thing I wish at this price point that could be better is that the steak knives are thin and bendy, they work fine though, just on the thin side feeling sort of cheap. I'd recommend buying this scissors right away with this set, it goes in the bottom hole and is handy to have. I'd buy again."
3,Rust spots,"These are very good knives overall. I have used them for about a year now. They are sharp and keep their edge well. The weight, balance and grip are all very good however a few of them have developed rust spots that i can not get out. I have never run them through a dishwasher. This is the only disappointment i have experienced thus far having used these knives. ps, they were also featured as a good buy on the today show, i think a reference to a consumer reports review."
5,"Great value, great product",Great value for the knives you get. The silicone handles are soft and are easy to handle. The only downfall I would say is that I wish the santoku knife was a bit bigger. But overall very satisfied with item.
4,Replacement is fine,"Had to correct damage that probably occured due to shipping the knives loosely in smaller boxes by requesting a replacement set, but that was a relatively painless process. I believe the knife set offers good value for the money, just as Consumer Reports indicated. It's certainly a long step up from the ""molybdenum steel"" knife set I purchased in my early 20s."
4,A Great Value,"This set looks great and the knives are very well made for the price. The OXO Good Grips really do feel nice to work with, secure when cutting and easy to hold. This set is not the same calibur as some of the very pricey gourmet knives, but for the money, it is a great value."
4,OXO knives,I bought these knives after reviewing knives on Consumer Reports. As an added bonus I got them with a 30% discount. The knives feel well balanced in my hand and hold the edge quiet well. I would highly recommend them.
5,Amazing knives,I've used this set of knives for everything and they haven't failed me after 4 years!!! You have to try these!
4,Knives,"Oxo Good Grips Professional 14-Piece Knife Block Set is convenient. The knives are easy to use, comfortable to hold, and very sharp."
2,You can get better for the $,"I love OXO products but these knives were not up to their usual standard. They were very lightweight and almost flimsy feeling. I returned them and ended up buying Henckels which I was much happier with. OXO should stick to their kitchen gadgets and such, because they're so good at that stuff!"
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I did plenty of research before buying this set, and less than 2 years later I'm now searching for a replacement. I just today learned that even if a knife product says it's dishwasher safe, to still hand wash. That said, these have predominately been through the dishwasher as that is how they were advertised. They've rusted a decent amount (as read in another review, comet will help remove) but my biggest complaints is they will not stay sharp. We used the blade sharpener and that helped a lot at first, but now I'd have to say my butter knives would do a better job than the steak knives as they will not sharpen at all. Even the utility knives which don't get nearly as much use are almost worthless. Very disappointed, as I've been a fan of OXO products in the past."
2,Quality changed from last year,"I ordered two sets of these previously for family gifts, and they arrived very sharp and were well-liked. These are dull and look different. There are different numbers written on the blades, but this might be a mfg date (0909 vs 0710). They were cheap before Christmas - $49, but not worth replacing our old knives. Returning."
4,Excellent Knives,"Bought these knives for my boyfriend (an avid cook) for Christmas and couldn't wait to give them to him, so he has been using them for a few weeks now. He is very particular with his knives, and I surpassed his expectations with these. His mom has a similar set of Henckels and they are equal, if not better to the quality. His favorite so far has been the 8"" chef's knife - he uses it for everything.The knives are lightweight yet well-balanced. The grips are comfortable and durable. They are VERY sharp and caution should be taken when using them. Everything about the whole set is clean and professional. The only reason I gave four stars was because instead of the 4-inch Santoku, he got two 8-inch slicing blades. He seems happy enough, though.Definitely would recommend these to anyone who wants high-quality at a great price."
5,Best set ever,I have had several sets of knifes over the years and this one is the best. I looked around for advice before buying a new set and this was a consumer reports best buy. I have had this set for almost a year and I have had no issues with any of the items.
1,I don't get these reviews,"I got these for a Christmas present., this year. I've used them mainly to cut fruit, and I'm the only one who uses them. Four or five of the knives are already just plain dull, and despite resharpening, won't cut anything. As I use one a couple of times it becomes so dull that I can't use it anymore. I am SORELY DISAPPOINTED in this product, and I don't understand how so many people are calling them excellent. I am certainly no expert, but hey, I expect a new set of knives to last at least a year or so. These things are going in the trash soon, and, as some say you would be foolish to do, I'm going to spend the price of this set for one knife that will really cut. Don't waste your money!"
4,OXO knives,"The knives are great. I was a bit surprised that there are more holes in the block than knives that come with the set. I had to research to realize I didn't have missing knives. Room to grow, I guess."
1,Strings too short for Gibson B-25-12.,I have a Gibson B-25-12. The low G (string 5) of the Marquis 80/20 set that I purchased was too short to reach the tuning peg. Did not have this problem with the previous set of Dean Markley strings. I assumed there is some sort of standard length for these types of strings. What gives??? Emailed Martin -- no response.
4,Great Pair of Sandals,"I love these sandals. They are very classy, the heel is just high enough for walking comfortably."
5,temporary bride,Well I was really very impressed and moved deeply by this book 'Temporary bride' by Patricia Wilson.I want to beg you to send me on-line through my email address this book so that I could download it.Thanks:))I have never read more wonderful book than this one and I really need to have it in English because i have it translated into my language-Bulgarian.I want to say that I have read it three time for two days and I think it is great!It is not just an ordinary book-it's something incredible!
2,Perhaps appropriate for beginning riders,"This is a very basic introduction to bits and their function. The book never adequately addresses the subject and comes far short of the title. I believe that all except the most novice of horse enthusiasts will already be familiar with the vast majority of the material presented.If you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject and you're looking for a very brief overview, this is the book for you.""The Complete Book of Bits and Bitting"" provides a much more thorough coverage of the subject although it is perhaps a bit too thorough for the novice rider."
4,I love this thing,"I love this item. I have had it for about 3 months now. I paid about 100 dollars with all the discounts. Being 16MB is pretty good considering the price and dual function. The phone function is really nice, though I wish the speaker phone was a bit louder. It is very easy to hotsync software to the phone. Only thing I have been having problems with is installing new ringtones, but that is a trivial issue.As for the customer service, I have never had an issue. I had every issue I had handled quickly. Always have with sprint and handspring."
2,Great device...Terrible Manufacturing,"I owned the Treo 300 for about three months before I started having problems. I mean, sure it worked well and did everything I wanted and needed it to do, but after awhile of use, the hinges that hold the earpiece on broke off. This happened only after normal use (opening and closing the lid). It was a disappointment to say the least. Another thing about it was the fact that it was alot bigger than I had expected (not having seen it live before because I bought it on the internet). This is not necessarily a bad thing, just inconvenient at times. So overall, if you can overlook the broken hinges and the oversize, it is a good phone. I do not recommend it!"
1,Lack of customer support,"I just recently lost my earbud and cannot seem to easily get it replaced. The problem is that only one works with the phone. Even the Sprint people don't have the skill sets or knowledge to understand that only the one earbud provided works. The most amazing thing is that if you go onto their own website, Sprint will be happy to sell you an earbud that won't work with the phone!"
1,*** PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE *****,"I've been using this phone for 11 months and I'm waiting for one more month to get over so that I can go for another phone without breaking the contract.Pros:Reception is good.Cons :This phone gets reseted automatically, if there is no charge left .. and it has reseted about 10 to 15 times past 11 months... So i have lost most of the contacts cos it erases everything... Ofcourse u can sync it with computer and have those contacts saved, but u dont want to sync it with computer every time u add a contact expecting the phone to get reseted anytime...I have got problem with missed calls and voice messages, sometimes it wont indicate that there is a missed call or voice mail....It is very big to be a cell phone and sometimes it sucks....I'll highly recommend people not to buy this set, I'm not saying this just by using for 2 or 3 months, I have used close to one year and had lots of bad experiences with this phone...I'ld have given 0 stars if they have one ...."
3,Handspring Treo 300,"I've had this phone for 3 months. It is my first PDA. I love the PDA capabilities combined with a cellphone. I've had no problems with battery life. I am disappointed over how difficult it is to figure out how to access my email account. One has to download Eudora(or similar program) to access your email. Yet, in my case, it still does not work. (I called Sprint tech support several times, and no one seems to know how to make it work!). I also am disappointed about the browser not being able to read Java script. Also, the flip-top lid is now cracked right below the hinge. I've read past reviews about the delicacy of the lid, and I have been extra careful with it, and I have not droppped the phone. So, the breakage may be from wear and tear? I disappointed that this occurred after only 3 months. Overall, I like the idea of a PDA/cell phone combo. But, this one needs more work!"
3,checkout Treo 600!!!,for the price and the functions this is a nice buy... but looking at the new model you may want to spent more $$ to get the Treo 600. but still a good buy~! from Amazon of course :)
4,A Very Good Product,"The Treo isn't the best at all the things it does, and that's OK. What is does do well is pull together several applications and allow the user to accomplish of number of tasks with one device. For those of us who don't like carrying a lot of hardware around, it's a welcome compromise. I've found over the last 8 months or so that I've had the Treo that I use it heavily, and to me, that is the test of a useful product. The only complaint I continue to have is with the battery life. Since the device does not allow for battery changeouts, it does limit the time between re-charging. Other than that one complaint, I think the Treo is a real step forward."
1,never use sprint again,"This review has nothing to do with this phone. I am very unhappy about their service.1. You have to pre pay for a month of service and they are rude enough to refuse to prorate you last month service. You are definitely going to be ripped off on average of half month of your service fee. (about $45 for me, could be more)2. Their coverage is bad. Constantly drop signals. I came to a sprint shop, they said I need to upgrade my software. After that things are not improving ..."
2,Be careful.,"I bought this watch over a year ago. It was a really good looking watch. However, a little after a year it stopped working. When I took it in to buy a new battery, I found out it was not the battery that was bad. The watch was sent by my jeweler, a reputable jeweler with whom I have done business for years, to a Seiko watch repair who said the watch was no longer being manufactured and that they had stopped making this watch something like 10 years ago. Also, to fix the watch would be $87.50, the ""standard"" price to refurbish Seiko watches. Since I only paid $125 for it in the first place, I didn't think it was worth it. I've worn Seiko watches for years and years, and this is the first time this has happened. Maybe your's will last longer..."
4,Hair color,This is easy to use and hard to find this shade in the stores. Amazon shipped for free and they were fast. Much more convenient than driving to Target or Walgreens.
3,Colored well but burned my eyes,I just needed to cover some root grays and this did a good job but wow it hurt my eyes! I normally use L'oreal Excellence Cream #1 Black Hair Color which I love so I am going back to that.
2,"Not Chestnut, More Like Mahogany - Quite Red","The color is pretty, but no where near the color on the box. It is a mahogany/red color. Much deeper and quite red. There is NO gold. I am disappointed with how dark and how red the color is. The grey covered very well (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1). I don't really like the formulation -- the gel colorant is quite drippy. I also like that it only takes 25 minutes to process. I might try it again if I had confidence about the color choice."
1,Broken and damaged hair,Tried medium auburn red on my hair twice then medium copper brown. The roots were red and the rest of my hair was light brown. I had been using a salon. My hair is now broken and damaged and nothing helps. I will have to let it just grow out. Will never use over the counter again. Will go gray before that happens.
1,Intense red copper.,"Bought this in INTENSE RED COPPER. It was disappointing. My roots are red, and the rest of my hair is blonde and hasn't changed color at all."
1,Purchased from the store. Too dark and RED,After following the instructions to the letter this product turned my wife's untreated medium brown hair to a very dark auburn color. Thanks Loreal!
3,"Some great things, some not so great.","First off, this turned out gorgeous. Absolutely perfect, very close to the box. LOVE this color when it's fresh. I have medium to dark brown hair and it really turned out fantastic. However....I've really only been getting about a week of vibrant red before it starts fading despite using mild shampoos formulated for colored hair, without sulfates. I'm having to recolor every two to three weeks otherwise it's more of a really dark auburn color instead of intense red. The formula is very strong.... smell is strong and it burns my scalp. I am hoping to find an alternative to this product with more resistance to fading...the burning scalp thing probably isn't good either...nor is coloring so often. Good news is that despite very frequent coloring my hair is still in good condition."
1,turns hair light COPPER!,"I've been using several dif. brands of light ash browns for years.. All give basically the same nice, cool (ash) toned brown hair over my light brown warm toned hair. . . Just used this box, and my scalp is itching like mad, the fumes are SO toxic and strong, and my hair came out a weird coppery color LIGHTER than what it was already (dark blond/light brown)..?? do NOT trust this color to be what it says!"
2,6A light ash brown(cooler tone) ~ reddish/BRASSY and horrible,"I am very displeased with hair outcome after using this product. Brunettes starting out w/ medium or light brown, Do NOT use 6A light ash brown unless you are looking for auburn hair. The color does not match color tone on box. I purchased the product in June of 2012~ not sure if this is new formula bc in past had different outcome. This new version left my hair with strong orange/red brassy undertones, esp on roots in direct light. My hair was just cut and very healthy. I plan to go to salon asap to ask for color correction treatment or toner bc I hate it. I would not buy this product again ever!"
2,More red than advertised!! Don't like it.,"This came out much redder than advertized. I have naturally dark brown hair and I haven't used hair dye in over 6 years, so I thought that the dye would turn my hair a sortof lighter brown like the box advertised on the side. However, my hair is darker and has a deep red (almost purple) hue to it. I dislike it!! Also, this isn't as easy to apply as the video adverts say it is - luckily my roomate was a willing participant. I am giving it two stars due to the misadvertising of the color and the difficulty of application. I should have chosen another color."
4,Put a lot on,"It made some of my hair look purplish. My hair looked really pretty in the sun, though; so thats a plus. But overall, this product was great!"
3,Good but!,&#1575;&#1593;&#1578;&#1602;&#1583; &#1575;&#1606;&#1607; &#1589;&#1576;&#1594; &#1580;&#1610;&#1583; &#1604;&#1603;&#1606; &#1604;&#1605; &#1610;&#1593;&#1591;&#1610;&#1606;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1608;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1591;&#1604;&#1608;&#1576;...&#1575;&#1593;&#1578;&#1602;&#1583; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1576;&#1587;&#1576;&#1576; &#1575;&#1606;&#1606;&#1575; &#1605;&#1587;&#1576;&#1602;&#1575; &#1589;&#1576;&#1594;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1593;&#1585; &#1576;&#1604;&#1608;&#1606; &#1583;&#1575;&#1603;&#1606; &#1580;&#1583;&#1575; &#1601;&#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1575;&#1579;&#1585; &#1576;&#1588;&#1603;&#1604; &#1587;&#1604;&#1576;&#1610;
3,Burned like crazy!,"I used this before, a couple of months ago, & it was fine. This time it started burning immediately. My scalp, ears & neck were burning like crazy from the beginning. It did give me the lightness I wanted, but because of the high volume peroxide, it left my hair an extremely light yellow instead of ash. I will now have to use a toner. My hair was already bleached up to a medium light blonde. But I hadn't used anything on it for about 2 weeks prior."
1,ZERO stars.,"This product did nothing to my hair. It didn't lighten it at all, just made it kinda shinier...slightly. it also damaged it. My hair, which was smooth and silky before, turned crunchy. Also, the fumes are so strong and I got a little bit of formula on my skin, well it BURNED!"
1,It ruined my hair!!!!!!! BEWARE!,"This dye left my hair red.My natural hair color y dark brown and wanted to cover my couple of greys (about 20). I never dyed my hair before.I am mortified with the results, I dont even want to go ouside the house. It left my hair red. I hate it, I dont know how to solve it."
2,Not my preference,"When I started coloring my hair a couple of years ago, I used Garnier Nutrisse, based upon a friend's reccomendation. I decided to try Loreal's preference brand b/c of their ""fade resistant"" claim. I have used light ash brown on my hair (Garnier) w/ good results. So my experience w/ Loreal Preference was not great.1) when I was applying the color my eyes were watering & stinging, and my scalp was burning.2) The color is lighter & more red than the light ash brown I used from Garnier.With Garnier, I have NEVER had a problem w/ fumes or my skin burning. I will go back to Garnier next time!"
3,FRIED MY HAIR,it turned it the right blonde i wanted but my hair was breaking off as i was brushing it. it just jept coming and coming out. i bought some intensive conditionar and it kinda fixed it...
5,Best hair color ever,"Tried them all and this one is by far the best haircolor for going lighter. If you want blonde highlights or all over color, this will do it without ruining your hair. L'Oreal is awesome."
2,OK,"I was able to do this on my own. I can't say it was easy...cause I stained some of bathroom cabinets.At first, my hair color came out SUPER dark. After a few days, my color starting getting lighter and lighter. Now, I like the color on my hair...but it wasn't the color I originally intended to get from the box.I would purchase this product again but in a lighter shade and have someone else color it for me."
5,sturdy and long lasting,I bought the Hamilton Beach juicer about 25 years ago and use every day. It is a remarkable product. If you want to extract the maximum amount of juice from every orange or grapefruit it is better to chop off a small portion of the top and bottom of the fruit before squeezing (I learned this by watching coffee shop attendants at work). My HB juicer looks like it has a lot of years ahead in strong form so I highly recommend this product.
3,Has some PLASTIC in contact with the juice,"If you are concerned with the contact of acid and plastic, like I am, then don't get this juicer. The funnel that seats the SS juicing cone is plastic. In the description is says metal construction, but they neglected to mention the juice drains through plastic. Shoot. Other than that, is seems solid. Shipping was fast."
3,owner,I used this one time and the stem loosened up. There is a nut behind the drip cup to tighten it. You have to remove the drip cup to get at the screw. I have other ones of the same kind that didn't loosen up. Is this a manufacturer problem? Should probable use the warranty.
5,Very simple but effective,"The juicer works well and the other reviewers have got it right. I just wanted to add two observations to buyers. First, the juicer is very tall so it doesn't fit underneath you kitchen cabinets. Second, there is a limit to the size of the fruit you can juice. The only oranges I could find at first where large eating oranges and although they could be juiced not all of the orange was juiced. When I started using valencia oranges which are smaller and tangerines it completely juices the fruit."
4,Fresh Lemonade,I got this juicer for my wife as she LOVES making lemonade from scratch. This thing is a lifesaver for this activity. She was going to make a larger batch (Like 24 lemons) just before her birthday so I gave it to her early and she loves it. Basically effortless to use and it does a great job. Little mess and it saves her hands a bunch of straining. It is well made and I have no complaints. I would definately buy it again. Only complaint is that it could have a larger base so that a larger bowl or a pyrex measuring cup could fit between it. Other than this small issue I give it a thumbs up.
5,Stop looking at reviews- buy it,"If you are looking at reviews, it means you are already in the market for a citrus juicer. Stop looking. You found it. Just click ""add to cart"" and go back to watching youtube.This is a FANTASTIC juicer. Way better than the twisty kind that makes your wrists hurt after 3 lemons. It is well made, mostly made of metal, sturdy, and will clearly last a LONG time. It makes juicing citrus fruits a breeze. It is super easy, and honestly, the handle action is a lot of fun. It gets all the juice out with one pull. There are no sharp points to cut yourself on, and it is a snap to clean. Win win win.We just got ours. We have used it for lemons and oranges. It is kind of tall, but we plan on using it often, so there is no need to find a place to store it. (Plus, it makes your kitchen look hard-core.)Buy it. You won't be sorry. Tell all your friends to buy one, too. They might not know it yet, but they need this juicer."
4,Great for Wine Glasses,"I probably wouldn't recommend this product for everything, because it's a waste of battery and it's not really any more powerful than you'll be able to scrub with your hands and a good sponge.However, I'd recommend this for one particular use: Cleaning the inside of wine glasses. My hands are way too large to fit inside small lipped wine glasses while holding a sponge. With this, you can just stick it in and scrub, especially that little pool of dried up wine that tends to collect at the very center of the glass if you leave it overnight. Best way to clean it I've found.Pretty sure this is discontinued, so stock up on replacement heads while you can."
3,this is an okay product,the idea is good but the reality of it is that it might be more work then it actually be worth.
4,Tall glass scrubber.,Did you let milk or fruit juice sit in a tumbler overnight? This'll get it out. These newer models have stiffer brushes than the original as well.
5,Great reading!,"I really enjoyed reading this selection of ancient Egyptian writings from the Middle Kingdom. Parkinson did an excellent job in editing and writing those opening introductions to each section. I really loved the one on the Maat and the king, though all of them were equally interesting. It's great to read ancient Egyptian writings. It really gives you a feel for what these people thought was important. Lots of small tidbits you would never have thought exixted. An excellent book for all to read, a must for the Egyptologist!"
4,Two sax stars jamming together in '62,"A nice, informal session with cool jazz alto saxophonist Paul Desmond and his likeminded West Coast pal, baritone Gerry Mulligan. This disc features several songs that were skillfully edited together from multiple studio takes -- pretty seamlessly, when you listen to them -- and they show the deft, good-natured interplay and genuine warmth these two shared. The CD reissue adds five new tracks, only two of which are alternate (or unedited) versions of songs that appeared on the original 1962 album. Included are two loose-limbed jam sessions that also featured guitarist Jim Hall, one of Desmond's most sympathetic creative partners. Perhaps a bit forceful overall, and not as fluid and soft-touched as Desmond's best work, but still a fine jazz album."
4,I agree,"I agree with the other reviewers here. This is a very good album, but not a must-have. Paul Desmond fits nicely into the mode of West Coast ""cool jazz"", with Gerry Mulligan, but if I want to hear this kind of music, give me Art Pepper any day instead, that will always get five stars instead of four."
5,best introduction to equivariant topology,"As the title of my review suggests, this IS where one should start learning about the subject. Other books which could then be tackled (in any order, really) are: Bredon's classic, tom Dieck (especially if you're wondering about the connections with representation theory and stable homotopy), Guillemin et al. on equivariant de Rham theory (with a view toward applications), Allday+Puppe and Hsiang on hard-core cohomological methods, among others. Note that Borel's seminar on transformation groups is a little out of date, but still worth looking into. Much more recently, P. May compiled quite a few very interesting articles addressing the equivariant stable homotopy category, attributing them to R. Piacenza.There are many other avenues one can pursue after reading Kawakubo. I've only listed a few. Good luck :o)"
2,Gas Station Maps,"These maps cover roughly the 25 square miles of land involved in the conflict before the battle. It can be very useful for the student of the battle who is trying to understand positioning and the terrain. Though these maps are well done, they are of the paper variety you typically find at gas stations. I was a bit disappointed in the lack some details and that these maps were made to be like that of the fold-out kind. I reasoned 2 stars due to the cost and quality of material that you get for the money."
2,None of Indra Sharma's Beautiful Art,"I just received my deck today & cannot begin to express how disappointed I was to find that instead of showing Indra Sharma's beautiful art on these cards, instead they are photographs of people, places, & things. While they do contain the wisdom of Dharma & the Vedas, it was not at all what I expected. A big disappointment."
1,Blatant false advertising,"As someone interested in the early Vedic period, I found the deck to be an utter disappointment. The majority of quotes are from various Swami's, the next most frequent source is the Gita.There is one single quote from the Laws of Manu, a quote or two from the Upanishads...... and NO quotes from any of the Vedas. You will see no mention of Indra, Varuna, Agni, Soma. The Vedas, Vedic deities, and entire Vedic period is ignored.If you have an interest in modern Hinduism, the deck may have mild interest (I say mild because it does not have the depth of anything like the I Ching or even Ralph Blume's New Age Runes) but if you are looking for quotes from the Vedas you will be as disappointed as I am."
5,BRILLIANT BOOK!,"I'm no literary critic but this book is HYSTERICALLY funny. I'm a big fan of Orton's writing and wit and I couldn't disagree more strongly with the other review that's been posted here.If you like high camp, this book's for you. I can't think of another book that made me laugh out loud as much as this one except perhaps A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES. If you have love for Noel Coward, Joe Orton, Kenneth Williams, Julian and Sandy, Paul Lynde, Charles Ludlam or Charles Busche, you'll have love for BETWEEN US GIRLS."
4,Historically the best I've read,"I've read alot on the Druid tradition of both today and in ancient times. This is an excellent read for anyone who wants to know about historical accounts of the Druids both from Roman and Irish writings. Some Druids committed most of their ideas and beliefs to memory, but the Irish Druids wrote some things down and so their accounts are in here too.Most of these are excerpts from different writings on the subject. If you are just interested in Celtic tradition from a historical stand point or if you are interested in finding out more about what the Druids were like, this is an excellent book to read from.It's only declining aspect is that it is dry history. Pure facts and pure history can bore some readers and so it may not be for everyone. However, it is good information none-the-less. Overall, it is a great book of Druid history."
3,Could someone <who read it> please review this book?,"I'm interested in this book, and was curious to read what others thought of it. If you've read it, I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts. Thank you.(I gave it 3 stars just because I had to assign a number.)"
5,Excellent read that walks the line between intellect and spirit.,"I am only part way through the first volume, but it is far enough into the works to gather an understanding of the maginitude of Swami Vivekananda's understanding and straight forward elucidation of Vedanta. His writings are intellectual in nature with a strong undercurrent of spiritual truth. He has the ability to stir within the mind something unspeakable through his words. This is a testament to his depth and understanding. So far, in this first volume, there is an ongoing feeling of freedom from creed and blind belief, and a very structured, scientific approach to living through Yoga. This will certainly appeal to those who are disheartened by orthodox faith, but still are religious minded and are a seeking for greater truth. Excellent!"
1,unhappy,the advertisement implied all eight volumes would be privided. i received volume eight only. rw
5,A wealth of wisdom,"The first volume, alone, changed my outlook on life, religion, and spirituality. The volumes contain deep, practical wisdom on all aspects of life. The presentation of the material will appeal to westerners and easterners alike (and northerners and southerners :).The enitire volume set (actually 9 volumes) are available, online, for free via:http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/complete_works.htmThe entire set is also available for purchase on cd-rom via:http://www.advaitaonline.com/vvkmmcd.htm"
3,just another dance-theme movie,"This is just another dance-theme movie. It's built on the story of a young woman reuniting with her father who abandoned the family during her childhood. She fell in love with a dancer-to-be. The rest is just average-quality dance routines with the usual dramatic scenes and acrobatics. Among movies of this genre, it pales by comparision with Saura's ""Tango"" which has truly top-notch music and dance performances interweaved with a very captivating plot."
2,Kindle format a shame,"This review is not aimed at the content of the book; rather at the utter lack of care for formatting the Kindle edition.Not only do I find hyphenated words in the middle of the page, chapters are not page dependent and may occur anywhere on the page, and now line spacing has gone to heck in a handbasket as well.That's what prompted me to write the review. I literally have a g and a d that are overlapping!That said, it's readable; but I tell you when the formatting is so bad that it effects the flow of the writing - it need re-done.Hopefully an anomaly."
5,Excellent Heroic Adventure,"I'm rather amazed that this books got some so-so reviews... it's great fun. If you enjoy David Gemmel or Steven Erickson, this is a rousing adventure tale you'll enjoy. It's a shame these books don't have a US publisher. I almost put this book down about 1/3 of the way into it, but I stuck with it and was pulled in by it's action and charm. Very satisfying and am ordering more by this author."
2,"Disappointing, not well written","There are aspects of Dawnthief that have real merit. The story moves crisply, there's real imagination in the creation of the Dawnthief world, the magic system, etc. However, the positive aspects are clearly outweighed by poor character development, inexplicable plot twists and some flat out sloppy storytelling.My idea of great fantasy fiction is strong 3-D characters, believable dialogs and coherent and well thought through plot changes. None of these are present in Dawnthief."
4,Most Excellent,"I love nitty-gritty military fantasy and I truly enjoyed this book. Barclay is not afraid to let his characters explore the qualms of life and self:devotion, love, suffering, sacrifice, and death. Though the book does end well, not everyone gets away with a happy ending"
4,Not quite as great as I hoped,I'd heard great things about this but found it a little formulaic. All in all not a bad read.
5,Truly Heroic Tale!,"Three cheers for Barclay in creating this truly heroic tale of a group of mercenaries who must work together stop a terrible evil from destroying their land! Raven, a cynical band of mercenaries find themselves allies with a sinister college of dark magic to cast a powerful spell to save their world from the vast army of barbarian wesmen who are lead by shaman and evil Wytch Lords.Barclay spices his epic novel with brutal and realistic battles scenes and powerful images of magic and sorcery.He also has splendid plot twists and not scared to kill off favorite character.Unforgettable reading experience!"
2,Reading this book required too much effort,"I didn't enjoy this book. It had a tendency to abruptly switch scenes without much in the way of transition. I didn't get involved with any of the characters--the book was a bit aloof. Too many of the main characters were killed too easily, especially for a fighting group that had gone 10 years with only 3 casualties. But the main problem was that it took effort to read. For me, well-written fiction books typically don't require much effort."
4,D&D days revisited,"This brings me back to the days in the 80s when I'd spend weeks with my closest friends ensconced in some adventure or another. However that nostalgia didn't translate, for me, into a deep love of the book itself. I'll probably read the rest of his work, as it's certainly entertaining. But, for me, it didn't draw me in the way Joe Abercrombie's stuff did."
3,Not bad...,"The Raven are a small but elite mercenary force and in this book they get involved in the hunt for a spell that will save their country from domination by the Bad Guys.I liked the idea of the Raven and soldiers and mages working together as a team and there are some interesting ideas in the book, but it is slightly clumsy in how it is put together. There is a mix of everything in there, dragons, mages, soldiers, other dimensions, war etc and perhaps at times is tries too hard.Certainly it took me a little while to get into it and I found the first couple of chapters a little confusing.While not brilliant it is quite readable and I suppose the fact that I have bought the next two in the series is an indication that I must have enjoyed it..."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I can't begin to explain. This book was a waste not only of $11+, but of 2 days of my life, as well.The author is a classic example of a dried up D&D player who wants to write a book after reading too much R.A. Salvatore. The world building is childlike, the ""heroes"" are depthless, and the plot was designed by a simpleton.This is one of those books that appears to have been floated in its Amazon rankings by friends of the author- it reads like a self-published book.I am angered that I was bamboozled into purchasing it. Most of the reviews here read better than the story itself."
5,cube's best hip-hop album of all time,There is nothing much i can say but this album by Cube is the best i have ever listen to since The Predator. The best songs are BopGun & Check Yo Self.
2,Featuring..Ice Cube CD.,"Has only tracks 2 & 5(Check yo Self) which I like, doesn't have : ""Today was A Good Day"". I am not a Big Fan of Cube, Pac is better, and Cube & Westside connection (only 2 good songs) was bitin' Pac at the time(pac said it).Overall,Would have been better if it featured more of his songs."
4,"Its aiight, good idea coming out with this compilation","This cd is a good mix of old skool hip-hop and gangsta rap which died out back in 95. This is a good cd 2 have, if u dont own any previous cds by him."
2,Arrogant All the Time,"Dr. Covan writes about his experiences as the Chief Psychologist and Intern Supervisor at Bellevue Hospital. While the general storylines are somewhat interesting, I cannot get past his condescending tone. His patients seem more like a collection of ""crazy"" behaviors than human beings, and his interns seem to be in the book mainly to fawn over his techniques. Dr. Covan's own personality is the strongest one in the book, and the one in which he appears most interested."
3,The Whitechapel Conspiracy,"While the book is well written, Ms. Perry puts forward an event of True Crime about which there has been much discussion and research. Unfortunaly, she picked the least likly answer to this continuing mystery. Most of us who study this particular crime have discounted the theory, using historical data, long ago."
1,Royalist Pap - Baroness Orczy would be proud,"Well, Anne Perry has done it again. She has written another bad Thomas and Charlotte Pitt book. I think I will stick to her other series. Perry used to write good, thought provoking books on the hypocrasies and horrors of Victorian society. This book is about how to preserve the status quo. The evils of change. Baroness Orczy would love the book, which glorifies the Royal family, even while admitting that they are nothing more than useless drains on the budget. But they provide ""glamour"", so let's keep them. Gag. And the people who would like to get rid of them, and set up a more equalitarian society, are portrayed as power-hungry monsters. Pitt and Charlotte used to care about the little people. No more. They have become reactionaries bent on preserving the status quo. I guess once Pitt became a fairly wealthy man, he forgot his roots. What a shame. Oh well, there's always William and Hester."
3,Not one of her best efforts.,"I have to confess that I've never liked this series as much as the Monk series, although I do think that some books in this series(especially the earlier ones) are quite good. Lately, however, the author has undertaken, in my view, far too much development of subsidiary characters, so much so that, in this book, Pitt and Charlotte almost take a back seat to the others. Also, I'm surprised noone noticed the total artificiality of the plot device. Pitt and Charlotte have rich and well-connected relatives, in Emily and Jack, and an even richer and more well-connected benefactress in Vespasia, yet we are expected to believe that Pitt had no choice but to accept this potentially suicidal banishment. Come on."
2,Misleading description,"Described as ""Chrome"", I assumed that it was made out of metal. It is not, it's chromed plastic. I was looking for a heavy duty clothesline for my application. I'm afraid that the plastic base will break so I haven't used it."
1,Pure Poor Plastic JUNK,"I'm a product engineer, and I'll say that it doesn't ever get much worse than this junk.The slotted mounting holes (plastic) for the wall screws are too small to allow a fit! You can't get it to fit all the way, so the darn thing won't stay attached. The wall screws are too flimsy to hold into the wall. When we tried to make them fit the slots, the whole thing fell apart, the coiled spring assembly inside popped out and bent, never to be usable again. A complete nightmare and waste of time and money! BEWARE!"
3,Fantastic Movie - - Terrible Print,"This is a terrific movie. To see it is to love it and want to see it again. But if you've never seen it, this video is not going to make you a fan. The subtitles are unreadable whenever they appear against a light background - - there are entire scenes were the subtitles are lost over things like a white tablecloth. Still, the acting will certainly allow you to follow the story - - you won't be lost or confused. In fact, the whole movie is blurry. I had to watch this video in parts because it gave me a headache trying to look at it. But, all that said, if you've seen it and must, must, must see it again, this print is better than nothing. Am I glad I spent the money? Yes, I had to own this movie. I'd just rather have it in a more watchable edition."
5,"Age Cannot Wither, Nor Custom Stale...","...this little jewel's infinite variety (with apologies to Shakespeare for the paraphrase).I have seen this film at least nine times, and each viewing brings new things to discover and love. The direction, set decoration, music, cast and photography always delight, but this time around I must also pay tribute to the screenplay. Knowing it so well I spent time last night really listening to the nuances of the script, in particular that of Charles Boyer's general. Unlike the showier cleverness of my previous favorite moments (""I don't love you, I don't love you, I don't love you"" must be the most passionate non-declaration of all cinematic history), I admired as if for the first time the restrained, dignified, tragic journey the general takes from amused tolerance to suppressed love to frustration and, finally, a soldier's resort to arms. I cannot give adequate expression to my love for this film."
1,five star film one star video print,"I purchased this video--the VHS version currently offered by Amazon.com--and was disgusted by the quality of the print. The print is very worn, the subtitles sometimes faded, quite often in the last third of the film. This film is beautifully photographed, the elegance of its backgrounds an essential part of the world in which it is set, and its meaning. These backgrounds are a worn blur much of the time in this print. I cant believe the other reviewers watched this print, for they surely would have complained too."
1,THE EARRINGS OF MADAME DI,THE ACTUAL MOVIE IS VERY GOOD. THE QUALITY OF THE VHS WAS VERY POOR QUALITY AND THE WRITTEN WORDS COULD HARDLY BE READ. I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE MANY TIMES AND THIS WAS A VERY POOR QUALITY.
5,Just Awesome!,"When I opened my Ice Cream Shop/Deli 8 years ago, a 3-Spindle mixer was near the top on my shopping list. 3 years and thousands of ice cream shakes and root beef floats later, the Hamilton Beach 950 was still running like new without a single flaw when I closed the business. It still looked brand new, like I just pulled it out of the box. (It would get sanitized and polished every night before closing up) Moving forward to 2010, that same mixer now stands proud on my countertop in my home. Still looks brand new, and still performs like brand new. After purchasing many, many Hamilton Beach consumer and commercial products, I can accurately comment on how great they are. I wouldn't hesitate buying anything Hamilton Beach."
4,I'm glad I got these,"When my son's logic work started asking for him to find the attribute block that matched, etc I thought I could get away with finding shapes around our home that would work. When that didn't work, I thought I could just cut out the shapes from construction paper. When that also didn't work I turned to Amazon for the attribute blocks I thought I could do without.I don't use these with an overhead but the pieces are nice size and though I don't want them to throw them at each other they seem durable enough. I am very happy that I made the purchase and the price was right! And the logic work is much easier with the right tools."
3,Everything brings you to the edge and tosses you over.,"This double CD album of spoken word is perhaps the most disturbing thing I've ever listened to. Taken from one of the grittiest, true to life chapters in Rollin's book, EYE SCREAM, it is not for the faint of heart or idealists. Well maybe it is. Consider it a rude awakening. Not as humourous as other Rollins stuff though. I recommend buying the book first (hey it's bigger and cheaper). If you like that you might want to go for the rawness that is Rollin's spoken word."
4,Great for price but....,"Light weight, comfortable for bigger head but like one of the guys who got a scratched glasses on the side, I did too, but too much trouble to return it for this price. I think its a 50 50 shot of good or scratched."
5,Great fit,Has a great fit and a distortion-free clear glass. Well made and priced really well for the quality. Highly recommended.
5,Daniel at his Best,"This is a wonderful concert of Inspirational music. He performs his classic ""Rivers of Babylon"" in true Daniel O'Donnell style. It is very nice to watch before going to sleep, since it is very inspirational. It also has his #1 song ""Footsteps"", which is one of my favorite songs by Daniel in any genre. This is definitely a must have for all Daniel O'Donnell fans."
5,Daniel O'Donell DVD,"I buy these Daniel O'Donelle DVD's for my guardian in Canada. She's his BIGGEST fan! She almost has his whole collection. She loves and cherishes all his DVD's, but this particular DVD takes the cake! This is a great gift for people who just need a little encourgament and upliftment in their life. I highkly recommend this DVD from Daniel O'Donell. Spiritual healing is the best healing!"
1,Biased,"I say this book is so biased I couldn't even finish it. So if you are pro- israel regardless of the truth this book is great for you, if you are seeking the truth don't waste your time on this book."
4,very satisfied,"shipped very quickly, no packaging issues , no dammage to the item.the item was cost effecient.the only thing more i could have asked for was a digital copy."
4,It all folds out,"Well i got the cd ""da chossen few"" and i sat down and i took the rapper off the cd and put it it and i listen to the whole thaing as the day went by and it came to my surprise that i found it using alot of diffent bass lines and surprising sound that usally wouldnt be tight but it just all falls togather for a wondering pieace of work by the one and only Brotha lynch hung and Lethal so there for i gave it four stars.So yes my fellow music lovers if u like that siccmade style here you go and i would suggest to pick a copy and see for your self"
5,Instant Classic,"This book should become required reading for all High School and University students, teachers, and researchers with an interest in North American anthropology, ethnobotany, botany, biology, historical ecology, fire history, forest management, and history. It will be of particular value to readers with an interest in cultural and natural resources management, agricultural sustainability, and federal Wilderness policy, among other topics.The book is excellently written, organized, and indexed, for both general reading and specific reference uses. It is a wonderful addition to Anderson's other major contribution to science, Forgotten Fires."
5,Wonderful book!,I just finished this book and went online to see what else this author has written. I was shocked to see that the book has not rated a unanimous 5 stars! I thought it was superior to most of the fantasy that I have read. I love fantasy and feel that most of the time I have to put up with mediocre writing to enjoy what are otherwise good stories. (Not all the time--there are definitely some great fantasy writers out there as well). This story was beautifully written. I found myself pestering my husband to read this paragraph or that to him--just for the poetry and imagination of it. (He hates when I do this--so I am selective in my pestering--but this one was a must!). Beautiful writing and a story and characters and an attention to cultural differences that were all fascinating. I am off to find out what else this author has written...
2,Great story about a mythical Mexican underworld ....,"and it was from that point that I really did finish reading this book.The book deals with our recalcitrant hero, Harris, a small time hood that escapes from New York to, believe it or not, Cuernavaca, to go into hiding from some other small time hoods that he had cheated out of sufficient money for him to enjoy 500 dollar prostitutes.And, oh well, that want the story is mostly about to decide whether the mexican, and some Califonia girls that Harris beds are actually prostitutes or just whores that enjoy the attention.Although the book was interesting I can't really say that it was all that erotic though the author certainly did do some study of the strange and wonderfull in Mexico.So if you are expecting eroticism, dont buy the book, if you are expecting lots of great sex, dont buy the book, if you ecpection an in depth look at the Mexican culture, dont buy the book .... otherwise .. well .. nuff said OK"
5,"yes, sir, that's my baby","Well, it isn't actually my baby, really, but I thought that sounded really spiffy and was likely to catch the reader's eye. This book is gorgeous; I was positively floored by it. For those detractors who complain about the huge typeface and the scant content, may I point out that [a] the typeface isn't quite that huge--certainly not big enough to warrant the comparison to a children's book--and [b] the copious (not to mention, extremely helpful) marginal notes add the equivalent of, perhaps, another fifty pages. The material is extremely well organized and--insofar as I was thitherto wholly ignorant of Slavic mythic archetypes--utterly absorbing. One wonders why the table of contents succeeds (rather than precedes) the first page of the first chapter, but I divagate. The professors who collaborated on this opus did a slam-bang job of opening a secret world unto the ignorant Western European (or his American kith) and for that I heartily thank them."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I wanted a second recording of this opera, and bought it on the fly, figuring the Abbado version was a surefire addition. The other reviewers are sadly right on the money. One of the worst recordings I have heard in quite some time. The voices are muffled at best, and frankly, it sounds as if it was recorded in 1955, not 1975. La Scala and Abbado, wonderful cast, just a real pity."
2,The orchesta sounds fine...,".. and if this were a symphony, I'd give it 4 stars. This is not a symphony. I'm giving it 2 stars only to encourage Opera d'Oro to continue bringing us GOOD recordings at these bargain prices. This is not one of them. The singers are barely audible. It hardly deserves a single star. I feel cheated.I don't intend to swap this at my local CD trading post; I can't bring myself to pass this on to an ususpecting collector. It's heading for the trash can.Live and learn"
3,Funiest opera,One of the funniest opera I ever heard. A master piece of musical humor. The humor belongs to music. But the quality of recording could be better.
3,"Fine round-up but where is ""HOLD IT"" and the 12"" mixes?!","I bought all of TIN TIN's erly 12""s/LPs when they first came out in the 80s, and while it's rather nice to have most of his ""hits"" on CD (esp like having both '83 and '85 mixes of KISS ME), there is one glaring error: WHERE IS ""HOLD IT"" the 1983 12"" he did on Wanrer Bros? It's his BEST song, equal to Kiss Me- couldn't they afford to license it? And while youre' at it, WHERE ARE THE 12"" MIXES of Kiss Me, Icing on the Cake, etc? What's the point of putting out STEPHEN TIN TIN DUFFY on CD and no club mixes? Maybe next time. Still a keeper for true fans until they get it right."
2,Only 2 good songs on this CD,I only purchased this CD because I couldn't get a couple of the songs (Kiss Me) from iTunes.
2,Kiss You,"If all you really want is the song ""Kiss Me"", then you should instead buy the CD ""New Wave Dance Hits: Just Can't Get Enough, Vol. 8"", which, despite its being a multi-artist compilation, sports a better & longer version of ""Kiss Me"". It also boasts some other hard-to-find, one-hit-wonder tunes from the 80's that you probably also are longing to hear.As for THIS CD--I haven't had the patience to listen through most of its other songs. Maybe I'd acquire a taste for them if I did listen through them, but with the exception of the song ""Cocksure"", they don't draw me in within their crucial first few measures. The catchy ""Cocksure"", in its melody and twang, is evidently a non-American's parody of the Country and Western (both) styles of music.The other songs generally sound kind of--Well, let's put it this way: They make you feel sort of embarrased for Mr. Duffy, much as you do for ""W"" when he's speaking contemporaneously."
3,nice but skimpy,"A decent book, but just an overview. How can you do justice to, and give useful information about, the wild plants in about 60% of the US and Canada, and in just 116 9 x 7"" pages?? You can't!"
5,Excellent Book!,"I liked this book very much. The book is a review of ""Bleu"". It reviews everything that one has learned from ""Bleu"" and goes on to teach, one, more French. My vocabulary has increased as well as my passion to learn more. I must say though, that if you are just looking to pass a class or something, then I wouldn't bother. French is a somewhat difficult language. If you are serious in learing french, this book along with ""Bleu"" and ""Rouge"" are excellent begining books. ""Blanc"" allows you to see what life is like in France, in their ""Note de culturelle"" The only semi-difficult thing is, that the excercises descriptions are written in french, so unless you know a little french, you will have a hard time completing the excercises. But other than that, it's really a great book."
2,Poor recording,"I have heard Michael Feinstein on other recordings and always enjoyed him. However, this recording is apparently very poor--the microphone is overdriven, making his voice harsh and high notes especially unclear. Perhaps his youth at the time might account for some but certainly not all."
5,Excellent!,"I absolutely love this album. It's been out for a while, but in my opinion it's one of the greatest albums of Gershwin music! Any Gershwin fan must own this album!!"
2,MICHAEL TRULY HAS THE VOICE,I take pride in the fact that i have most of Michaels' cds. He is truly a remarkable talent. Michael is probably one of the greatest discoveries of the past 15 years. There doesn't seem to be much of this kind of talent around any more.The main concern i have for this cd is the fact that Michael didn't seem to sing enough of The Gershwins' biggest hits. There were some more huge hits that i think should have been included on this project.I think anybody who buys this cd will be very happy with it. May i please encourage you to experience the voice of Michael Feinstein.Recommendation: I would urge you to buy this cd.
3,Thin and non-uniform,A very thin book that suffers from a nonuniform level of presentation.Attempts to treat optimal control from a functional analytic viewpoint. Youhave to basically know functional analysis very well as a prerequisite.There is a nice editorialized bibliography in each chapter.
4,Heavy BUT Really Comfortable,"this sleeping bag is really comfortable, gives a relaxes sleep. It is a bit more heavy than normal sleeping bags, so it depends what is your priority ... If you cannot carry a little heavy bag for long time then do not go for it. If you can and are looking for greater comfort level, then this is an awesome item. I love it because I do not travel/hike a lot and the thick foam layer gives me a relaxed sleep whole night. The foam seems to be of good quality and it do not get pressed after sleeping at one position."
4,Good for its time.,"This particular feature was extremely good for its time, but compared to some of Penthouse's later releases, it just doesn't hold up as well when compared to such videos as Dear Diary. Of course, the final sequence with Julie Strain is definitely a keeper."
5,well worth the price,well worth the price. finally could throw away all those stupid little sharpeners that my wife buys (that don't work)
2,Too short,"This item just arrived and I haven't opened the package, so I don't know how it works. But it's only 14 inches in length from tip to tip, not the 17 inches indicated on the web page. I'm returning it for a refund. Item looks OK, if length is not an issue, but I was looking for something longer for honing chefs' knives."
2,Disappointed; rusted immediately,"Given all the glowing reviews, I ordered the Oxo sharpening steel over several others that were available. When it arrived I hand washed it, as I do all new cookware items. It immediately rusted. Not a big surprise as it's made in China. Oxo customer service suggested vinegar to remove the rust. While that took most of it off, it is extremely difficult to clean between the narrow tines of the steel. I don't want to ruin my good knives with a rusty sharpening steel so it's going back. Two stars because Oxo customer service was helpful in processing the return. A real shame because the steel has a nice weight and the handle is comfortable."
5,Hones like a gem,"This honing steel is a great value, it sharpens all my knives without problem, very basic, simple, well made, nice tool. Well done, OXO."
5,There is nothing better than an iPod. Period.,"I was always under the impression that the iPod was neat, but that there were better units out there for the money. At least that's how it looked to me. I was wrong. Very wrong.The iPod is, hands down, the coolest player out there. It has a decent battery life (this has not even been an issue for me, but then again, I walk around with the thing in my Powerbook case and recharge it when it needs it) great performance, and above all it sounds fantastic. Apple made some great decisions with regards to the audio decoding hardware on board - I get all sorts of nasty artifacts on my Archos and Creative players during some songs, but those exact same files play great on the iPod.Apple has one real winner here."
1,Rotten Apple. Pathetic.,"My iPod has failed for the fourth time this year. This is simply a sickeningly, pathetically, embarrasingly unstable device. Apple should be ashamed with themselves. I shaln't buy another Apple product ... not out or spite/recrimination, it would simply be a waste of money and time. I hope that Apple have counted just how many customers they've lost by selling this tat."
2,looks pretty but...,"Bottom line I have had to have my iPod replaced three times, for the same problem, until apple finally refunded my purchase. Maybe the old ones were good- but not the new ones."
1,What is the hype all about - this thing is OVERRATED,"I just bought one and feel ripped off. The user experience is terrible if you want to use the iPod to listen to audiobooks and to store data on the device. It tries to take over your machine with iTunes, and doesn't let you copy any files from the iPod to the computer - in short, you can't really use it as a portable hard drive. I'm giving this thing away and going back to my Creative Jukebox. Don't you people know there are better devices out there? This one seems to be getting by on looks and branding alone - just an awful user experience."
3,FROZEN APPLES,"Great Hardware - the best. Marginal software - itunes is mediocre and unwieldy!! Ive had my 40gig ipod 3 weeks and Ive reformated it twice. Im looking at my frozen apple ipod now again which wont re-boot. I have to reformat it. It hates big file downloads in the juvenile cradle. If one music file in your 30 gig collection happens to lose its link while being downloaded to your ""one-way"" ipod it might freeze the ipod to the core. !!!! Not possible to use this proprietary machine with anything but lowly itunes. Stick to MP3 - uses less space and easier to handle big files. An Apple MP3 player wouldnt be bad. GOOD LUCK !! Shooperman Age 45"
1,Don't buy a 40 GB ipod,"We have completely wasted our money buying this ipod from Apple. It experienced a software crash within 4 months, so we sent it off to the Applecare centre with their couriers for repair. It was returned back to us damaged! Since then, Apple refuse to accept responsibility for the damage and we can't do anything about it. We are disgusted with the way we have been treated and will never buy anything from Apple again. I would recommend anyone thinking of buying an ipod to read the reviews on the Amazon.com USA website first as these are genuine reviews. Don't waste your money on this product - it's overrated and unreliable."
1,"""LOCKED""","A word of warning to potential buyers. MY sons Nano is ""stuck"" in the ""LOCKED"" mode. I did some internet research and it appears nearly all Nanos have this problem. Obviously a design flaw. The unit is still under warranty. I spent two-hours on Apples ""Award winning website"" and finally gave up. A total nightmare...please see for yourself. Their are multiple class-action lawsuits against Apple over the Ipod. Final note...BUYER BEWARE!"
5,The best,"Who needs a stereo with this baby? I bought some computer speakers (19.99$) and I have all the stereo I need. Let's see, on my ipod I have thousands of old radio shows, hundreds of hours of music, sermons, talk shows... the list goes on. I couldn't live without mine."
4,Great for the Technologically Inept,"I love music, but hate computers and gadgets. As long as your computer has the juice to work with the iPod (my previous one didn't and I had to return the iPod), the iPod is extremely easy to use in turns of loading and playing music. I shied away from this for a long time (probably a good thing, since there seems to have been problems with the earlier models), but I love this thing. You will definitely need a case or a silicone-based ""skin"" to cover it; otherwise it will get scratched. The shiny metal sides and back look great, but you have to take great care when they are uncovered. The XtremeMac clip case is the best I've found so far. If you love music and have the $400 to spend on this, I would do it. Some of the other Amazon reviewers have some great tips, and I won't try to repeat them. My message is to those who might have worried that they won't be able to get this to work. You will."
2,"Excellent user interface, but died in less than 2 years","I love the iPod interface, but this little guy just can't seem to last two years. My hard drive died, and the Apple store couldn't get it going again unless I shelled out $200-$250 for a replacement hard drive. Might as well buy a new one. I have to say that these iPods either have batteries or hard drives that die in what seems to be a short time frame. Apple did offer me a 10% discount on my next iPod if I turned in my old one, but to be honest, I found that a laughable offer give how much I originally paid for it. They also wanted me to buy the $60 extended warrenty (so that it would cover two instead of one years). Apple, if you can't make a product that lasts for two years, then either take it off the market or improve your quality. I did buy another iPod because the store offered me a student's discount, but if this one dies with in two years, I am seriously going to consider another company."
1,Dies after 4 months,My 40 GB Ipod died after 4 months and had to be sent back to Apple for repair. They sent me a new one which also died after 4 months. Very similar experience to previous poster. It seems there is a serious design flaw with the 40 GB Ipod. I definitely would not bother buying this.
1,Wonderful until it breaks,"Worked just great for about 9 months, never crashed once. Then one day it just wouldn't turn on anymore. I sent it in for replacement, but instead of a new one they gave me a refurbished one. This one crashed once in a while, had to be reformated twice, until 5 months later it permanently crashed. They sent me another refurbished one which crashes about 50% of the times I use it, had to be restored twice and then crashed permanently just 2 months after receiving it. I am so angry with Apple now. I deserve my money back for this."
2,worst technical support,I have had my I pod for less then a year and I have enjoyed it for the short time I had it. For the past three months it has been shipped out three times for service. Every time it has come back not repaired and I had to ship it back to be serviced again. I feel that apple is just biding time until my warrenty expires. I have visited the apple wesite as suggest by my ipod and the website is just about as helpful as the technicians that repair the ipods. I have never had a electronic device that was so costly work so poorly and for such a short period of time. I would strongly recommend not purchasing this item.
3,Screen is very bright,"The Ipod is my constant companion. I have an extremely large and varied music collection, and am adding to it all the time. Battery life is much improved, screen is very bright. The touch-wheel on the new one seems a bit more sensitive. With the increased capacity I can load music at higher bit rates, 192kbs and above."
1,Haven't received purchase yet.,"I contacted the seller but have not heard back yet. The ipod was supposed to be shipped a month ago but I still haven't received it. I'm not sure what to do. Please help.Thanks,Greg"
1,Lemon of the Bunch,"In the first year, I had to send my iPod in under warranty a total of three times. Twice, they replaced it. My iPod recently died for good, and because I'm not covered under warranty anymore, I could buy a new one for the cost of replacing it. When I looked into it, I found that loads of people with the same model had the exact same problems. It's the lemon of the bunch. There's a reason they discontinued it."
5,The best dawgon music player on the market,The real name sounds a little weird but its my moms account but now to the point. THE 40gig I pod rocks there is no mp3 player on the market. Personlly I dont see why people make such a big deal over the mini in my view this one is much cooler. Some words of advice though. Using the back light drains the power so fast so use it sparingly. Also the front and back look really cool but 1 week of usage and you start to see little scratches on it and smudges on the back so you should buy a case. Besides that its great it looks cool plays great holds more songs then you can shake a finger at and actually comes with good head phones unlike most mp3s that come with .50 cent ones. So in short This is the best I pod ever use it on a plane subway or at school it doesen't matter it looks cool and works great.
1,Yet another 40g with recurring hard drive problems,"I was lucky enough to have an HP service contract that extends the warranty for 90 days after repair. My iPod 40g has failed for the 8th time in less than 2 years or like clock-work about every 90 days. Always the same ""Sad Face"" icon that will not respond to any of the simple procedures that Apple or HP propose to remedy the problem.I cannot understand why Apple has not instituted at least a trade-in program for this ultimate lemon. A recent survey showed that it failed at 10x the rate of the newer models. For me, I am not sure that I will ever buy an Apple product again regardless of a trade-in.I really have never understood the cult of Apple. It is no more reliable a product or more intuitive a product than anyone else. It is all Steve's PR."
4,Apple iPod Rocks,"Love the iPod. Very easy to use both iTunes and the iPod. 40GB to much space, so go for 20GB model. Battery life lesser than 12 hours, but even 6 hours is plenty. iPod gets dirty easily, need to get case. Get one from iSkin.comiPod Rocks. A MUST HAVE."
1,Simplicity is not.............,"The ipod is another example of the big companies trying to control the market. This piece of hardware is too delicate, unreliable and expensive. One of my major shocks was to find out that the sound has no bass and treble adjusters, no enhancement whatsoever and it sounds overall poor, flat and definitely harsh, also it has no built in radio tuner. True, it is a convenient piece of hardware, but the cost, complexity and absence of sound controls makes it another technical curiosity of our century. Stick to a good walkman and/or cd player, make your life easier, not complicated. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
1,bad quality and service,"Got my ipod last year, the screen shot this year. Got a replacement from Apple and it died in a few months. Spent many hours on the phone with Apple, finally it was told the replacement is out of 90 days warrenty. Bad customer services and quality. I have seem been charging the silly thing all the time. The battery does not last (1-2hours). I have ordered a sony Sony NW-HD5 (red) after reading the review. The battery is removable and last 40 hours. Can't wait for my new toy. Goodbye IPOD for good!!"
5,Talk about Sexy and Sleek! you betta RECOGNIZE,"Alright, basically, if you want a bangin', cool-looking, hip music PLAYER, this is it! To buy an item like this in the first place, you must like electronics. If you like electronics you would want the coolest looking one out there, so here is where the iPod will beat any other device out there.I own the 40gB (4th generation) one, and absolutely love it. I have owned the 1st generation 20gb too, and have no complaints. Because they all are inclusive of a 1yr warranty, [god forbid] anything were you happen, you are covered. Other players usually have much less warranty.The new click wheel is NOT confusing at all... you wouldn't want to worry about that at all. Within about 20minutes of taking it out of its box, I was a pro and had the software installed and I was transferring all my files from iTunes right into the iPod.Overall, if you are into cool electronics, this is a MUST-HAVE. So go out and get yours today!Happy iPod-ing"
2,"Piece of crap, I feel sorry for you if you have an HP",Hp Ipod what can I say. I got it as a christmas present in 2004 and it broke down in 2005. Hp sent me a new one no problem but then the new one was worse than my old one. The new one was only 6 months old. I emailed Hp and they were not very nice about my situation as they were the first time. They took me through ever troubleshooting that I have already done. Then they told me that I would have to get a new one. I thought this was ridculous because they sent me one just 6 months ago. I said they sent me a faulty product and I should not have to get a new one. They told me it was just like a computer and the hard drive can stop at anytime. Please! I have had many PC and the only time they mess up was when I did something wrong. My hard drive never messes up in the computer. I never dropped my ipod i always update it and I think it is pretty ridiculous that a product 400 dollars has a shelf life of 6months to a year. BEWARE WHEN YOU BUY.
1,AWFUL! I will never buy another iPod again!,"I purchased this iPod for $350 last March. Less than two months later, it started freezing. Customer service finally sent me anouther one in July. It worked for a few months. Then it started crashing again. I was finally told a few days ago that my hard drive needs to be replaced...for $319. My limited warranty had expired! An independent repair service quoted me $200 for a replacement hard drive. I am outraged and will never buy an iPod again. $350 for nothing!"
2,Was great for almost 2 years- then Ka-Blooey!,"Really liked my Ipod for almost 2 years, thought the sound quality was fine, like Itunes and the playlists, bought a car radio with an Aux plug and used it in the car every day. All of a sudden the hard drive just died 2 days ago- wouldn't mount to the computer initially and then wouldn't turn on at all. I am just barely within my 2 year window for my American Express extended warranty, so hopefully I will come out ok- the replacement cost from the Apple Store near me is $270.... I am not happy that a $400 player would just die within 2 years and no one at Apple cares. Ridiculous."
1,Not Worth the Price,"Apple Computers should be ashamed of themselves. I received my 40 GB ipod as a 2004 Christmas present and the problems began after only 6 months. Though I sould say, I really loved my ipod before it crapped out on me. I see a lot of other customers have had similar trouble with this thing and I just want to cast my vote of disapproval. The problems are: The computer/itunes not recognizing the ipod. The hard drive spinning up but never starting. The hard drive crashing and losing all data resulting in having to reset the ipod to factory settings and reinstalling the software and after all that having the same problem happen again.After hearing all the horror stories about Apple's customer service I figure it's not worth trying to repair. Since this model has been discontinued, there's no point in telling people not to buy it now. I only hope that the new ipods are better. I'll be reading the reviews very carefully if and when I decide to get another ipod. Live and learn."
1,Apple products can be disappointing,"This is the second one of these I have bought.. and both have shut down on me. I have wasted over $600 on these Ipods as well as another $100+ to repair one of them. They are great for storing mass amounts of music... but they are very tempermental, and seem to breakdown unexpectedly and for no reason at all (i never dropped them/ no water damage/ hardly any scratches). It's as if these were put on some sort of timer to shut down on you after a while, so that you HAVE to go out and buy another. I really love the idea of an ipod.. but when I buy one, I'd hope that it would last me a LONG time cosidering how much they cost. But they fail on you as easily as any disposable item you can buy... and quite frankly, its too much money to spend on something that lasts no longer than a plastic fork."
1,ughhh...,"Mine broke after just over a year. No warrantee. I brought it to an Apple store, they checked it and told me to through it away. They wanted to charge me $350 to fix it or offered to sell me a brand new one for $300. Guess which option I selected? Just make sure you have backed up all your music!!!"
1,Breaks like Clockwork means that it is Rubbish,"I got mine for a Xmas present 2 years ago. Within 6 months it acted up, making me do the ridiculous R method of resetting it over and again. Itunes refuses to recognize it and now it tells me that I have a corrupted iPod--no kidding! At the moment, it is sitting on my desk like a dead bug on its back, frozen. Save yourself years of aggravation, listen to those of us who have had this for over a year...caveat emptor."
4,It was five stars until the iPod Photo came out,"I just can't seem to fill this thing up. I have loaded over a thousand songs, backed up my iPhoto and still have room. It is my constant companion and the address book is a handy item. The only thing I don't like is the ear buds (too big for my ears) so I replaced them with some Sony ear buds. They aren't white, but they are comfortable. I used to love my 6-disc in dask CD player. Now I never have CDs in it."
2,Useless,Full of pretty pictures and clever graphics but when it came to real information about the places we were seeing we were left on empty.
2,Needs revising,Although pretty to look at this book lacks depth. I would have enjoyed exploring more out-of-the-way places that are not on the average tourist track. Many of the restaurants listed are out of business. Eyewitness hits the high spots but is in need of an update.
5,Don't leave home without it,"I used this book while on several trips to the SF area. It is perfect for sightseeing the city, as well as in determining what to see. Even in the outlying areas, the book points you in the right directions in which to go, though not as good as its coverage of SF. If you are looking for a book on SF, then this is the one you should look for."
5,A great follow up!,Mr Williams follows his first book with more great insight into running a successful spa and engages us with story to make the points and hold our attention. This book provides information in a fun and informative way. Can't wait to see what he writes next!
3,Shawnee Pottery guide book,"The Shawnee Pottery Encyclopedia is a lovely book, very nicely done with lots of clear bright pictures. The only thing that I found challenging was the price index, I thought it wasn't realistic. I loved the history and wondered why the Hull brothers jumped from Hull to Shawnee. Also, I would like to have had an index of the pieces for quick reference, they could either be by number or category. I tried to reference a piece as I was out Shawnee shopping and couldn't find what I was looking for until later after I got home and found out that I had passed up a piece that I would like to have purchased, but I needed the confirmation in the book that the piece was truly shawnee.Again, it is a lovely book and I have enjoyed going over it many times."
5,Very easy to understand and I feel I will learn a lot.,i really am enjoying the book and very happy with the packaging and time frame I received the book.
2,"Beautiful story, questionable illustrations","This is a very nice story, summarized in Booklist Review, that my 4- and 6-year old children love. They always ask for it around the time of the Lantern Festival (the official end of Spring Festival/New Years) as the illustrations of the lanterns are lovely. My girls always spend some time choosing the lanterns they love best. But I do agree that the illustrations of the people give me serious pause -- round faces, whisps of hair, buck teeth. (We bought the book from a catalog so I didn't see the illustrations.) Although we've purchased a number of Chinese-themed books for our children's schools, we wouldn't purchase this one. I would love to see the author republish it with different illustrations."
5,Just the book for my class,"I have been asked to teach a class for the non-computer folks at my retirement community. I purchased this book for each member of the class, and plan to use each chapter for a specific class session. It has very straightforward explanations of the basic computer operations and Windows XP, fully illustrated. I think it will be perfect to help me guide some seniors to computer literacy."
4,Windows XP for Seniors,This book is quite easy to use and contains a lot of useful information on Win XP. I am 79 years old and I found it very helpful in learning how to use Win XP.
5,Just incredible!,"A great film from a bygone era, very enjoyable and I will watch it again and again! If you want a REAL GRINDHOUSE experience, this is it!"
2,A very BIG disappointment,"The original Wishmaster was a very original and imaginative film, but its sequel is a very dull film with a hollow plot and bad acting, the only thing you have here is a bunch of bad actors who get mutilated in very gory and abnoxious ways. But if you must watch this movie then here is the lowdown: The Djinn is released once again from its prison within the Jewel, The Djinn must collect a thousand souls by granting wishes ( in his usual bloody fashion) to bring a Djinn invasion to the world. A very stupid plot with even worse special effects. Not even worth the renting price. Rated R for Graphic Violence and Strong Language"
3,Wasn't bad!,"Hey anyone who saw the first one will obviously say it was better. I didn't find it too scary, but then again i don't scare easily. It contained alot of gore scenes which is why i gave it a 3 star rating otherwise i still think the first part is much better see. i advise everyone who hasn't seen the part one to get of their (_|_)'s and go rent it right away."
1,SUCH A DISSAPOINTMENT!,"I first saw this movie on HBO a couple of months ago, and it was such a dissapointment. I liked the first, but the second was just lame and shouldn't have been made at all. It gives the first a bad rap. I can't believe this movie wasted my time! I wish i could give it a zero! oops I forgot I have to be careful what i wish for! LoL, the point is rent the first one! Not this one. I made the mistake of buying it. The acting was also really really terrible. The movie wasn't even scary as the first! Didn't even come close to the original. The cursing was just awful. every five seconds there would be a cuss word! It was the most awful horror movie i have ever seen! some cursing is alright but there should be a limit! And it was also way too gory! NOw i know why Wes Craven didn't present this one!"
4,Wishmatser 2 Rules,This was a great B-horror flick. One of the best I've sseen in awhile. Holly Fields did a great job (and she is soooo hot!) and the Wishmaster was as evilas ever. Two thumbs up!
5,The Great Andrew Divoff,"This is a wonderful DVD and a great bargain. Two of the great Wishmaster films for the price of one. The special effects are amazing and Andrew Divoff's performance as ""The Wishmaster"" is truly wonderful. Divoff is one of the best actors anywhere in my opinion because he knows when to be serious and when to be humorous. He makes these films enjoyable to people who do not even like ""horror"" films."
4,Nice to have both DVDs together,"I had the original Wishmaster on VHS, so I decided to order this double set on DVD. The set is overall lacking in bonus material. The second installment didn't even have an audio commentary, though the first one does.Andrew Divoff is fantastic as the Djinn and his alter ego. He is witty and scary, like Freddy but he's different than Freddy. A true original. The Wishmaster series could go on. It has a lot of potential since the idea of the djinn never dies. I'd love to see a Wishmaster 5 starring either Divoff or John Novak (from Wishmaster 3 and 4).None of this stuff is oscar material, but its fun. The first movie gets into some Persian mythology, made up based on the Tales of the Arabian Nights and the wicked genies of those stories. I really enjoy this whole series."
3,Speak your words carefully around the Wishmaster...,"Speak your words carefully around the Wishmaster... Otherwise he will cast his wicked spell, in all cases bringing death or pain to the wisher. DJinn the character is pretty great visually, and speaks very eloquently for an evil guy, which adds some class to his genie in the ruby character. The plot follows a young woman who tries to find ways to send DJinn back to his prison, as he manipulates the greedy ones around him with deadly wishes that all have a catch. Most of the wish deaths in WM1 and 2 are pretty clever, and this two disc set is worth the price. If you're looking for a nice spin on making wishes, this is a series to start with. Thankfully, DJinn has plenty of screentime throughout the series, great make up FX, though there could be more gore during some of the death scenes. I would give it four stars if there were plenty more victims who made wishes, as there are only a handful in the first two films."
1,Misleading information on the DVD,"I had previously seen the first Wishmaster movies, which I really liked, so I bought 1 and 2 here together in the pack because of all the positive reviews.However, I was disappointed. The movie cover states that it has English subtitles, but when I played it, there were no subtitles at all.This was disappointing because I had to send the movie back and get a refund. If DVD companies can remember to include all of the extras, they should remember to include the subtitles as well."
5,Got what I asked For,"Having seen these movies, I was glad to order them. They arrived as 1 dvd in which each side of the disc has a film. Works great, good quality, very happy with purchase.Compared to the 3rd and 4th wishmaster, these are more violent than sexual."
4,Djinn are not imajinary beings...,"The Holy Quran speaks of jinn as one of two spicies to be held accountable for their actions on ""The Day of Judgement"". They are actual beings livng simultaneously on earth with human beings in an unseen parallel world. This film depicts some of the means by which human beings are deluded by illusions of wealth or power. It demonstrates how ones greed or lust for material things can be exploited through the whispers and suggestions of an evil entity becoming blinded to any possible consequences. In a Hollywood sort of way it demonstrates how ones lower desires can bring about ruination . It should definitely make you think twice about what you wish for."
2,So Sad ...,"Sadly, this is not a good recording of Donizetti's Gem. I was so dissapointed. Those of you that want to enjoy Ms. Caballe in this opera should splurge for the Paris recording (Salle Playel, 1976) where the Diva is in stupendous form, Lima and Pons deliver honorably, and the recording is far, far superior."
4,me and my uncle,"My uncle had the Carnegie Hall version on LP and wanted it on cd. I don't think that version was released on cd and having it transferred was expensive and inconvenient, so I got him this version. Some say Caballe sang better at Carnegie, but Ed seemed to dig this recording."
1,Defective,"The player will not even turn on. I tried putting 3 different sets of batteries in, making sure the batteries were in right. I looked at the user manuel and tried the CD and radio buttons to turn on...nothing. So I'm sending it back tomorrow. Absolutely defective."
1,new but did not work,This item was jus as described new in package however once opened it did not work. . tried batteries brand new name brand and did not work. Would not even power on .
1,Junk - Do not buy,I bought 2 of these for my children for Christmas. They were so excited to have their very own CD player and upon our surprise they don't work. The one plays no sound at all and the other one doesn't even turn on. My girls are very upset and unfortunately because I bought it a couple of months ago it is past the return allowence. Now we are stuck with gifts that don't work. Do not buy. Spend more money for something that will actually work.
1,Horrible Sound Quality!,"I purchased this for my daughter's 6th birthday a few months prior to her birthday. So, I couldn't test it out before giving it to her. When she opened it, she loved the way it looked! Super cute and fancy! When she hooked the earphones up, she could barely hear the music. Thinking it was maybe the earphones, I grabbed another pair to test. These were no better! It was nice that the player was so cute and portable, but if you can't hear the darn thing, what good is it! Very upset with this purchase! It was one of the only things (besides her party) that my daughter received from us for her birthday and now it just lies in the corner. :-("
1,not good,it worked for about 5 seconds and then quit and could not get it to work again would not recommend
1,review,This product came to me broken and was not what I expected! I would not recommend this product to anyone!
2,NO BASS AT ALL!!,"Clarity is excellent but there is no bass and almost no mid range either. Worth $30, not more."
2,WARNING: Don't buy the Audiobook!,The problem is that it is read by the author who has the most gravelly voice. It is impossible to understand him! I wish I would had just bought the book.
4,Great stuff!,The book is written in simple language by a man who was simply a genious! The interviews included with professionals in the field were very informative.
4,Satisfied with services,I received my book in a timely fashion. I was satisfied with the services and the price of the book. I will use this company again.
2,"not bad,but neither good","it is pretty general,there is no such thing as advice or anything the like about practices.he insists in almost every chapter that the mission is the most important thing.the only intersting ideas in his book are some about leadership, but i felt very much that i already knew them,he only confirmed them.this is not to say i am a genius.i am 18, so i guess if you are involved in running a nonprofit for more than one year, you would be able to write a better book.for a beginner it might be intersting to get it from the library, and read it in a train or so.not bad, but getting a book on leadership,and other one on marketing is a much better idea."
2,Very strong fishy smell,"I have used the regular Ocuvite tablets but decided to switch to the Adult 50+ because it has more leutin. So, I ordered three from an Amazon supplier. The first and second ones smelled of fish the minute I opened the packages; the third one reeked to the point I got a headache from the dead fish odor. I don't know if this is due to the Ocuvite 50+ having Omega3 or the way it was stored by the supplier. They were all within the ""use date"" stamped on the packages. So, no, I will not get them again."
3,Questionable benefit,"Seemed as though my ""near"" vision worsened when I quit taking Lutein 20mg and used the Qcuvite alone. When I restarted taking the Lutein 20mg again it seemed as though my vision improved again. My observations are not scientific at all, so my conclusions could be incorrect. But it seems as though the straight Lutein 20mg seem to work the best for me."
4,Too soon to tell,Can not tell yet - will this help my dry eyes or not? Pills are not too large and are nicely coated to slip down easily!
5,Organized by the stages of wedding planning,"The Bride's Etiquette Guide by wedding expert Pamela A. Lach is a straightforward reader on the art of wedding etiquette. Organized by the stages of wedding planning so as to speed the process of looking up answers, The Bride's Etiquette Guide covers everything from seating stepparents to interdenominational marriages. The Bride's Etiquette Guide is an extremely useful and ""user friendly"" guide for hosting one's wedding in the most courteous and efficient manner possible. Also highly recommended are the author's previous wedding books: The Bride To Bride Book, The Bride's Money Book, and The Bride's Thank You Guide."
5,The best webcam for your Mac.,"The ""B"" model is the current model and its main benefit over the last one is that they fixed the major heat problem of the first version of this webcam. Great webcam with a great image reproduction. Can also be used as a still cam albeit attached to computer. Looks very good with any Mac and also now has the iMac G5 attachment which is a magnet to attract to the metal plate built in to the top center of the iMac G5's case. The stand itself is white plastic same as the iMac's. Also has a PowerBook, eMac, flat panel display and iMac G4 attachments."
5,Love this cam,"I have owned this webcam for a few months now and love it. I have kids in college and we video conference frequently. The sound and picture are worth the money. Apple makes this easy to install; plug it in. AIM is our software along with the Ichat-AV version. The pictures are clear and have no time delay. This is my third webcam purchase and by far my favorite. I even bought another one for the office. This is the Porsche of webcams. Can't someone help the poor Wintel folks have a real webcam. Is this Mac only or will it become like the Ipod, for all platforms?"
5,this is the cam,Wow. Everyone needs to have this as their computer cam. Just plug it in and you are off and running. Has great audio too.
4,Apple iSight Webcam,"It does what is needed, performs as expected. Had some difficulty getting it mounted so that the picture was not tilted."
4,Fact over Fiction,"People often find it disheartening to be told that something they hold reverence too is not what it seems. This book will surly suffer commendation by those that either refuse to allow such thoughts to permeate their beliefs or those that lack the historical reading to nod in agreement with Mr. Williams work. This book makes an excellent primer for those seeking the history of the Vatican or Catholicism in general, however, if you are not willing to except harsh criticism of such then I suggest to those, do not read it.This book is a historically accurate work, however, it is brief. If are well read in the histories of Catholicism or the Vatican it is unlikely that you will learn anything new."
2,"Paul Williams (the author) is a ""Church historian"", not a Catholic-basher","Please ignore review which heaps emotive bashing on the author, Dr. Paul Williams, as if Williams was some kind of ""Catholic basher"" (he is actually a dedicated Roman Catholic apologist). FYI, the back cover of another book he wrote, called ""The Complete Idiots' Guide to the Lives of the Saints"" (2001), describes Williams as having ""served as professor of Catholic theology and patristics at the University of Scranton [which proudly identifies itself as ""a Jesuit university""]"" and as ""senior editor of Northeast Books, the publishing arm of the Fellowship of Catholic Scholars"". (Hardly the credentials one would expect from a genuine ""Catholic basher""!) If anything, Dr. Williams strives to pin the blame for various historic Vatican scandals on a cardinal, the Mafia, or other convenient scapegoats, etc., as a PR effort to minimize ""damage control"" to the Vatican's reputation for scandals in WWII history, etc."
4,The Title says it All,"As an ex-Catholic, I found this book fascinating and accurate. I have spent many hours over a period of many years delving into the history of the church and found myself in total disbelief over the sins of this church. Unfortunately, further study only reinforced the evil deeds perpetuated throughout the ages by this religion. ""The Vatican Exposed"" does a tremendous job of exposing the illegal, immoral and criminal behavior that had become the MO in the highest echelon of the church.This account focuses primarily on the time from 1929 to the present and there is enough incriminating evidence present to make one wonder how anyone can remain connected to this harlot church, ""Babylon the Great.""This is a must read for all Catholics and serious students of scripture. The truth will set you free."
5,A slight problem with 'image',"Genuinely shocking book if you are not up on the literature in this nook and cranny, dark and ominous--coreleonic. Beyond questions of shadow finance lies the sherlockian big one. It is hard to grasp how media manipulation can succeed here. It is a sad exploitation of innocent believers. At least enter the undeground by acquainting yourself with the facts."
1,Shameless,A shameless retelling of history to suit one's own agenda. Not worth the time to even spend in further review.
3,Deeply Disturbing,"I would have given this book a four or a five star rating; however, the contents are so thoroughly documented and so utterly believable that 'I like it' or 'I love it' are not the right words, one could not possibly 'like or love' this book especially when other recent and ongoing revelations about child abuse are borne in mind. See 'Sacrilege' by Leon J Podles. If one of the ratings was 'compelling' I would have chosen it."
3,an eye-opening book,"I always believed that the Vatican was corrupt, but I was shocked to learn just HOW corrupt. Whether money laundering, bank fraud, ties to the mafia (including mob hits) or helping Nazi war criminals escape, its shocking just how awful these people are. The sad thing is, the law enforcement agencies know about all these things but haven't been able to prosecute because the vatican is a sovereign state and is accountable to no one.Valuable information. I only gave it three stars because it was hard to get through, at times dry"
1,Good movie ruined by appalling picture and sound quality,"I ordered this DVD from MovieMars, as I remembered seeing part of the movie being filmed in London in the 80s. Unfortunately what arrived was quite possibly the worst transfer of a movie to DVD that I have ever seen. Both picture and sound quality were, to put it mildly, appalling. Best to wait until someone does the job properly, but that could be a while away."
4,What a trip!,"This is a must-see for nostalgia fans of the 60's. I mainly bought it because it has Gary Lewis in it--he is a friend of mine and his goofy sense of humor shines in this dvd. And his personality hasn't changed much since then.The only problem I have with this dvd is that the dubbing is so obvious--especially watching musicians play an electric guitar that isn't plugged in--but it's still fun watching the lip-synching. Heck, people pay big bucks to see Britney Spears lip-sync live."
4,"great story, well acted","This isn't your traditional kung fu movie. In fact, there is almost no ""melee"" fighting in it. As the title would suggest, it's mostly about archery. The acting is good, the cinematography is excellent. I wasn't paying extremely close attention, but I do believe the ""enemy"" in the movie is the Mongols. This certainly isn't one of those movies where there is ""unrealistic"" action- ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys both die, and get hurt while fighting. The character development of the main character is pretty good, and it is definitely a movie worth watching."
2,Plain Bad !!,"This is not at all what I was hoping to see and what I expected from a korean historical drama.Their level is quite high, all-in-all. This was an overdone, non-stop chase with not much plotbehind it, other than running away from the mongol enemies. The result is that of a coarse chi-nese thriller rather than a more interesting and more sophisticated historical drama. This oneI will return or sell on the internet for $ 1."
2,Unoriginal!,This movie is basically the Korean version of Mel Gibson's movie Apocalypto. I loved Apocalypto and it's one of my favorite movies. I wasn't so much amused watching this copy and paste version of it that was adapted to Korean culture. Sure the writers mixed the plot around and tried to make certain scenes from the movie seem different but it's the same story only remixed. Even right down to the ending where in Apocalypto you saw the invasion of Christianity and in War of the Arrows you see a European guard on a Korean border. Was this a good movie? It was okay. I can't exactly give 5 stars to someone elses ideas that they stole. If anyone says this movie is nothing like Apocalypto or is original they are lying through their teeth. Please watch Apocalypto then this copy of that movie and you'll understand. This movie basically removes the Mayan culture and replaces it with Korean culture. I'm surprised they didn't get sued for this film.
5,Hollywood watch and learn,"I think as of late american movies have been lacking originality and are afraid to take a step in original and creative direction unless its guaranteed they make millions of a movie and treat it purely as investment. However Asian movies lately have been truly amazing such asIp man, vengeance trilogy,man from nowhere, ghilbi studio films and numerous others. This one delivers also. Amazing Korean film that is epic and has you at the edge of your seat in till the end 10/10. Move out the way Hollywood true film makers are going to seem roll you if don't take the arrows out of your ..."
4,A good little action flick,"Some good action sequences. Sergio Leone was watched. Mel Gibson too. Lots of good stuff. Expand your film experience, Korean-Chinese history of a sort."
4,Amazing!,"Although part of this movie makes no sense, the last 30 minutes of the battle in the movie was climatic. It is definitely a different type of film that you do not see made here in the Western World."
5,Would Watch Again,"I'm not necessarily a fan of this genre, but this movie was highly entertaining. I wouldn't compare it to The Hunger Games as some reviewers have - they're two completely different types of movies. War of the Arrows stands on it's own with great acting, action and drama."
4,Good action movie,"This movie has a plot, not just mindless action, and is well made. This is more like the old stories, characters have depth and the story is well written."
5,Outstanding!,"This is a film well worth watching! Has a great story line, very well filmed and very well acted! Exciting right from the start, then takes a little bit to set up the story, and once the actual story kicks into gear, it will keep you on the edge of your seat! I loved it, and so did my daughters (ages 24-35), and my wife. Great story and plenty of quality action. I noticed it got great reviews and so decided to watch it and so glad I did. Highly recommend it. enjoy!"
5,I LOVE IT!,"I rented this movie on Netflix, and loved it so much I had to buy it. Yes, this movie has subtitles, but it ranks among a handful of movies I could watch over and over without being bored. I even had to go rent other movies with the same hero, he was so excellent. Try it - you won't regret it!"
5,My bow is not for killing,"I have to agree with the others here that this film is amazing. For anyone that didn't like Red Cliff (I'm one) you should give this a try. This film easily could have been a disaster if not done right. Everything works from the story, acting and direction. The story reminded me a little of The Naked Prey where a man is trying to get home and is attacked every inch of the way. It had me hooked all the way to the shocking end. Do yourself a favor and check it out.Also look for The Man From Nowhere, another excellent film from Korea."
4,Exhilitrating,"What a movie! What an ending! Chair gripping suspense to the end. Have to say that the beginning was a bit slow kind of comedic (about 20 mins) but don't let that fool you. Once the movie starts it like a roller coaster ride, you know that turn and dip is coming but thats all, same here. The acting was excellent with some minor issues from the female star at times otherwise a very strong cast. The dubbing is very good in compasion with the subtitles. Will say that my family when the movie started looked like they were all just bored and joked, half way, no noise, at the climax there were oooo's and aaaa's. At the end they were ready to recommend to their friends. My take? Give the movie 20 mins or so to warm up, you won't be disappointed. On my watch again list!"
5,great help,I found this book to be the most helpful of all my parenting books. It gave a range of advice from a variety of perspectives and was not judgmental. There were many suggestions I used to wonderful effect.
5,extraordinary psychological nuance and sensual writing,"This is a great book, with vivid characters and plenty of moral complexity. It is about the affair of a very young man with an older woman, who uses him yet at the same time reflects the emptiness of her life and her enjoyment of control. You also get a wider view of the consequences of their affair on the delicate balance of his other relationships, particularly with his childhood lover. And the ""relations"" are handled with extreme dexterity and delicacy, never going for cheap thrills. It is packed with descriptions of sensations and thought, beautifully poetic and dense, requiring re-reading and reflection from the reader.Taken together, it emerges as a subtle and unusually stimulating reading experience. Collette truly was underrated.Warmly recommended."
4,Having Been There,I passed through Taos after getting out of the Navy from the midst of the Vietnam War. I rested at Morningstar from February 'til June of 1970. This book is an honest reflection of my own experience there and the people... the wonderful young people whose honest efforts to create something entirely new... powerfully realized by mostly positive but somewhat risky psychedelic experiences with peyote and other consciousness raising substances. I moved on to other places after that but Morninstar impacted my life in ways that have stayed with me to this day and this book embodies that spirit.I have published my own experience there in a fictional memoir as an ebook available at smashwords.com titled A Time Ago and Then.
4,One of the few movies about Wales,Since I was born and raised in Wales I was very interested in viewing this movie. I found it very interesting and quite authenticcompared to my experience of living there. It seemed to demonstrate a good sense of the history and day to day life of the recent past. Worth watching for those with a welsh connection!
5,WALES,EXCELLENT HISTORY FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN WALES. FROM THE BEGINNING TO PRESENT TIME. AWARD WINNING IN UK AND I AGREE.
2,"Grip is great, but cuts at an angle","Oxo Good Grips Professional 8-Inch Bread KnifeThis knife is made of good quality steel and has a good grip and feel as well. However, the way it slices bread is totally unacceptable. I bake my own bread, both rye and wheat bread, and I have yet to produce a decent slice with this knife that did not come out as a wedge. In other words the knife pulls to the left (a lot, not just a little) while cutting. The blade has a very nice serrated edge on one side and on the other side it is smooth. Someone told me that is the reason for it cutting in that manner, however the manufacturer's customer service people say it's made like this on purpose. It cuts o.k. through vegetables, but I bought it for bread, and it is called a ""Bread Knife""."
5,excellent,"Excelente cuchillo, con buen grip y buen filo, apropiado para uso profesional y hogareno. Toda la linea oxo es buena, con buen agarre y durabilidad."
1,not in russian?,the idem picture for this product was in russian but the book was in english. I can find this book for a lot less if I knew that and the only reason I even looked at this book was because I thought it would be a fun read in russian.
3,"nice, but it is cracking","I have made garlic 5 times so far; 6 bulbs each time. It tasted terrific. But the bowl is cracking all around and has only 2 inches to go before it completes a line on both sides showing that it is breaking. I never dropped it or anything like that. It is made in Taiwan. I will use it until it completely breaks, but will be looking for a US made one."
3,The problem is the base,"Its ok, well built and sturdy...but it has one BIG draw back.. its base is very shallow. Now, as you know the recipe for steamed garlic is : garlic, either elephant or regular, WATER, olive oil, bay leaf, whole peppercorns and kosher salt.* The water needs to be to the top of this base just so there is something left after an hour of steaming, right?! And, sometimes, it spills a little as I transport it to the oven the first time...ALSO:With such shallow base very little liquid is left, so forget about all that tasty dunking of bread into the wonderful liquid or saving some and sneaking it into other recipes!Another, less annoying drawback is that the lid isn't tall enough for a whole elephant garlic head.. I just break it apart, of course!* Bake for one hour at 350 degrees."
3,"Okay, but not quite there....","I've been an Eddie Reader fan since her Fairground Attraction days. I have to admit, although there are a few delights here (title track included) it's a little vauge. I would go for the previous CD, which is cunningly called ""Eddie Reader"" which has the fantastic tracks ""Right Place Now"" and ""Patience of Angels"". I would strongly recommend you check out her offering on the Batman Forever OST, which is one of the best tracks on the CD, ""Nobody Lives Without Love"", which has an unusually dark flavour. And I think you'll find the title is Candy Floss, not Gloss!CheersGavin."
4,A Slice of Russian Life,"This book of short stories presents interesting vignettes of Russian and Russian American life, a viewpoint we don't read a lot about in this country. With the exception of the title story they are all written from a child or young person's point of view. They are very well written and engaging and if they were published individually in a magazine I might even call them excellent. But standing alone in book form I found them not worth the expense of purchasing a book."
2,Cyber Spellbook Review,"I got this hoping I'd find a source of inspiration for being more of a Cyber Shaman or Witch and embracing the new with the old.While I applaud the idea of Innovation, this book just felt too tongue-in-cheek for my tastes. There's a lot of correspondaces that are rehashed from other books, trying to say which Deities translate to modern times and what a more modern approach to them would be, making this come off as another Wicca 101 with an attempt at a Technological Flair or Twist.And some of the ideas for modern tools and appliances as magickal tools or correspondances for use in magic is just way too hokey.Did I get anything out of it? I got a few vague ideas and whole lot, not for me. Perhaps with some strong scrutiny, I'd use some of the spells.The book reads like the joke is on the reader who takes the whole thing seriously. Like the authors wanted to get a book out there to fill a niche, but didn't take the sincere time to do it properly."
1,0 stars if I could,"GAG. Cyber Spellbook? This is ridiculous. I picked this up briefly at a bookstore to flip through for laughs and it wasn't even laughable just downright idiotic. The authors tell us we can ""create"" new deities, goddess and gods of computers, etc. OH PLEASE!!! How insulting is that? If Wiccans call these ladies ""experts"" in their traditions then I feel sorry for the mislead. I am appalled at the crap that is being churned out today. What is next - ""An Outline in Chocolate Magic""? Fluffy Bunny to the extreme and a waste of good trees."
2,Not Very Encouraging,"I purchased this book with the hopes of finding encouragement, suggestions, and even a bit of ""passing on of knowledge"".While reading this book I found parts of it very discouraging to us First Ladies/ Pastors Wives who are not married to ""big time"" Pastors. Especially when it got to the chapter about serving guests and etiquette.Not everyone has hired help, and not everyone can afford the items that she suggest are ""necessary"" in order to properly serve/host guests in our homes.I think some parts of the book were good like about the family and the importance of keeping family first.But overall, I was disappointed to have purchased this book."
2,Made me tired,"The book is chock full of must-do's. I was so worn down before I finished the book that I pitched it. Mrs. Patterson is out of touch with life in the parsonage these days. And, yes, I do know what she teaches at the seminary. That is part of the reason she's out of touch. Nothing new."
5,Loved it!,"I loved Mrs. Patterson's book. She shared some great ideas that I have implemented. For instance, the portable prayer baskets. I am making six up for Christmas presents, three of which are going to my daughters-in-love (as she puts it). In each one I plan to put a copy of this wonderful book as each are involved in the ministry to some degree."
5,I Love this product,"I bought the original Drinkwell and can't stand it because it is extremely hard to clean when there isn't a dishwasher available. I bought the cleaning tools recommended for it but, without a dishwasher to put the parts in, its just a big pain in the @** to clean. My cats love the running water though so I knew I had to get a fountain of some sort. My sist has the Platinum one and she showed me how easy it was to clean! I bought it, my cats LOOOOVE it, and I'm very happy I bought it.There is a review on here by someone of the different types of drink fountains and that review also really helped me to pick the Platinum fountain. I was also looking at the 360 one, but after reading that review, I realized that the Platinum one would probably better suit both the needs of my kitties and myself."
3,Our homes new water feature,"I thought this would be a good way to improve the quality of my dogs drinking water and he does seem to love it.I have a lab mix 65 pounds and it must be filled daily! Which is easy but I thought it would go longer between fillings. The filter also leaves charcoal dust in the water. Apparently this is normal and not harmful but it does seem yucky. Also be warned it makes a lot of noise, not pump noise but waterfall noise. For the first few weeks I always felt like the water was on in the sink. It makes less noise if you turn the flow up to high but you can hear it even when several rooms away. Also it is not for outdoor use!"
5,My cats love it!,"My cats love it! It's quiet and easy to refill and clean.Just a warning, it comes with a USA outlet plug, so if you live outside of the USA you may have difficulty in connecting it to the power outlet."
2,Wow...he likes it!,"I bought this with some trepidation as my 18 year old cat is very difficult and I wasn't sure if he would drink from it....not only does he drink from it (it took about a day...), but he seems to be drinking more. This is great because he has kidney issues. I also was worried that this pet fountain would create a mess, but it is great!! Highly recommended (by my cat!)UPDATE ON OCTOBER 23, 2011--The fountain broke...the motor no longer works......I am not sure how to fix it and couldn't contact the drinkwell corporation. This was a lot of money to spend on something that worked only for five months!!!!!Also, it was a pain in the neck to clean. My cat (who is 19 years old now) has settled back into drinking from a bowl and is doing well, but I am still annoyed that this fountain wasn't very durable....and that the motor conked out."
4,works good enough,"i only received this item yesterday. easy to set up, and my cat was curious. i think while i was away, he prob drank from it.my only problem thus far is that, i saw what looked like crumbs or small debris in the bottom of the fountain. i was sort of under the immpression that this would get sucked up and caught in the filter."
5,Turn off the faucet!!,"I use to have to leave a faucet in our bathroom running other wise my cat would not drink any water. I had purchased this product to end that. I have to say that she is drinking more water then ever and she looks more hydrated, I do not think she was getting enough water before. The fountain is very quiet, you never hear it running. You do not even hear the water that is pouring out it, it is so quiet. Very easy to maintain and built very well. Thank you so much for such a wonderful product."
4,"3 weeks in, so far so good","My kitty would not drink out of any bowl I offered her and would wait to drink from the sink. I decided to try this fountain and the results have been good. It is easy to assemble and not too crazy to clean. The cat was afraid of it at first, then would smack the water. After about an hour of splashing around she started drinking it. Since then she has had no issues and has been drinking much more water now. The occasional water gurgle will startle her when she is drinking, but nothing too bad. My only complaint is the pump noise could be better. It is no louder than my refrigerator hum, but my fridge tends to hum louder than most since it is about 16 years old."
2,"Great fountain, until it broke a month later..","My cats love this fountain. They like to play in water faucets, and this was the closest to the real thing. The water stayed clean (except for twice, it turned brown even after the filter was replaced.. so I just emptied the fountain and refilled to fix), the shape of the fountain compensated for the bulkiness, making it pretty easy to find a spot for it in the kitchen, and even though it had a slight hum, we got used to it fairly quick... and then the water slowed to a dribble.I have only had this fountain for a month and a half.I cleaned it and still nothing. I adjusted the speed of the water flow.. still nothing.I have read other reviews saying that the pump will stop working from hard water (I don't have hard water) and you have to order a $20 replacement. If this is to happen every month and a half, the fountain is better off in the trash."
2,Too Noisy,"The fountain worked fine, but it was too noisy even when filled to capacity. Also, my cats did not like it even after a couple weeks."
4,Great Pet Water Fountain,"I can't say that it got my cat drinking tons more water, but at least he's drinking more water than he used to. My cat recently had a UTI and our vet said that unless he starts drinking more water, we'd have to put him on this urinary ""special needs"" diet for like...the next seven to eight years. He recommended looking into a pet drinking fountain to see if that will encourage our cat to drink more water, and so far, it's been working! The evidence? The huge pee clumps I find in my cat's litter box. Yay! I've never been so excited to see that much to pick up out of his litter box."
5,Brought peace to water.,"I won't make a novel of the water issues I've had over the years with the various cats who have blessed this home, but there's always been problems. The simple fact is that this device solves them all. This is the blessing for cats that: want to wash their paws in an ""open pool"" of water; ""wet"" dry food in open pools of water; hate drinking from the same pool of water the previously mentioned cats have ""fouled""; loathe old standing water; hate drinking from a (cage-style) water bottle. Most importantly, it's a solution for any/all of the above types, IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD!Since I set up the Drinkwell Fountain; even admittedly not cleaning or changing filters as often as recommended in the last three months; my one big boy who was constantly jumping to the kitchen sink has not even ONCE bothered with the counter since.Very few products I've purchased have won my admiration as this one has."
5,"So far, so good","Have had this running for a week. Easy to set up. I have it in the main area of the house and I can't hear the motor at all. Occasionally I hear water trickling. Have not had any water splashing at any strength setting, although I normally run it at the slowest setting, but have tested it at all. My cat who likes to drink out of the faucet took to it right away."
3,Not so sure about Paltinum status!,"When I purchased this Drinkwell module to replace a Petmate that quit working (motor died) I thought my concerns would be solved but I was wrong. Although this Platinum module is a large capacity sturdy built size, it sure is NOISEY!! And no matter what I do to dampen the vibrating sound I couldn't get it quite enough to not finally consider replacing it with something else. The Drinkwell company really needs to look into this since I am not the only one to complain about the noise and vibration. How did this slip through quality control and testing? Anyway, the only redeeming thing about this module is it's large capacity and I did find it easy to clean. One of my two cats did drink from it often so I guess the noise didn't bother him. Oh well...off I go to find a replacement."
4,Lots to clean...,"My cat was a toilet drinker - if she would drink at all. It only took her about 2 days to figure this out. She still has times when she walks up to it and considers drinking but walks away. It buzzes a little as the motor runs, but it does not seem to disturb her as much as it does me. Overall, I think she is drinking more now.I am intimidated by the cleaning, however. There really is a lot to it but I have only done it twice. I think the motor cleaning is what worries me the most, I am afraid all the pushing and pulling of those small parts are bound to damage it sooner or later. (It states warranty void if the motor is not cleaned.)Since this was about getting her to drink, it has done the job - 4 stars, minus one for the cleaning process."
3,good but loud,"I like this, and my cat seems to like it but it is fairly loud no matter how full it is -- it also seems slightly too pricey for mestill interested, but will prob. get a better one in the future"
2,Doesn't work after a few months!!,I have two cats - one who loves water! I originally bought the smaller Drinkwell fountain but found that I was having to fill it up every day. I wanted something that had room for more water so it would last longer between filling it up. I got the Platinum fountain and for the first few months it worked great but now the only thing coming out of the unit is a little dribble of water. It seems like every time I go to clean everything it works less and less. I would not buy another Drinkwell and am looking at other brands for a replacement.
5,My cats love this fountain!,This is the 2nd Drinkwell fountain that I have purchased.I had the first one for about 3 years and it started to overflow all the time.Rather than buy replacement parts I decided to just purchase a new one.I have 3 cats...2 boy Mainecoons and one other girl.The boys love the flowing water and tend to not only drink out of the fountain but love to play in it as well.It's just a great way to keep fresh flowing water for my cats.
4,Good product - cats are still getting used to it,This is an excellent product. It holds a LOT of water and runs quietly with just the little babbling brook sound. I have 2 cats - a brave cat and a scaredy cat. Brave cat now drinks from it; scaredy cat still prefers the non-moving water tower. Brave cat will drink right from the stream and sometimes play with the water as well. My cats have not gotten any pieces loose to use for toys. I'm much happier knowing they aren't drinking standing water. I didn't find it difficult to clean; the bottom bowl is a good size but it's easy enough to scrub down and rinse under the kitchen sink faucet. All of the top parts come right off so it really is pretty easy to clean. I've only had it for about 3 weeks and am getting more skilled at getting it to the sink and back again without spills. I would highly recommend this fountain. It's our first and I would buy the same kind again.
5,Very Satisfied,Excellent product. Second purchase. Own one i purchased at Amazon. Bought another for daughter. Especially liked Amazons price and service.
1,3 cats got dermatitis from the plastic,"3 of my 4 cats developed disgusting black crusted mess with pink irritated skin on their white chins. It took a lot of heartaches and phone calls, tests, etc. to realize that the cats had an allergic reaction, contact dermatitis from the plastic. Too late to return. Going for a CERAMIC fountain now. I actually have 2 of these. Anyone want them for half price, including a bunch of new filters??"
3,great but...,"The sound of the water falling was too loud for me as I sleep in the same room it's in. After a year or so of use the cover of the pump broke a bit which slowed down the water flow, now I can have the water fall behind the landing if I want, I've found that having the water fall right to the front of the top of the landing is the quietest. So if you're bothered by the sound of the water falling find a way to slow down the flow, I'm sure there're multiple ways to do it without breaking anything."
1,"It's difficult to clean and in a 6 month, side by side comparison, my cats prefer a simple bowl.","This product ""made sense"" to me and I bought it. I gave it one star based on what my two cats ""told"" me. I put their regular bowl of water next to this product and to this day (6 months later) they prefer the bowl. My bold cat will lick the stream occassionally and my shy one is still a little afraid of it. I also gave it one star because my water comes from a well and it is not treated with chlorine (like city water) therefore, there is a ""scum"" that builds up over a few days. Which brings me to my third complaint with this product .. it's very difficult and time consuming to clean .. lots of tight corners and deep pockets .. I have to soak it in bleach to feel comfortable it's clean. I will stop using it and stay with the good old fashioned bowl, which my cats like better anyway. SO .. if anybody is interested in a used Drinkwell .. I have one for sale."
3,"A great idea, but you get what you pay for","Having filtered water is, I imagine, great for your cat. However, if you are looking to save the time it takes to just fill up a water bowl for your kitties, move along. You need to change out the water weekly. It's not too much of a pain but unplugging and removing the pump for dumping takes a bit more time than just dumping and filling a water bowl daily. You have to be careful about the changing the water out weekly too. Though it does pump and filter the water, items that are not light (such as litter that cats may paw into the fountain) sinks to the bottom and stays put. It can't be good drinking water that has litter in it for a day, let alone a week.I don't think this would be any safer than dumping and filling a water bowl daily unless you dumped the water in this fountain's water at least once a week. Save yourself some money, suck it up, and use a water bowl."
1,Vet does NOT recommend a pet Fountain because...,"One of my cats would drive us crazy with wanting the water faucet on. So we decided to purchase this to give him his own fountain of water. He loved it, but because I did not change the filter every month (I would remember 6-8 weeks), he was getting sick with vomiting. So if you plan to buy this, you MUST change the filter every month and CLEAN it thoroughly every WEEK!!! Because of the need for a clean filter every month and the need to clean it weekly it was too much work so I am only giving it 1 star. We have decided to go back to the regular water bowl and run the faucet for him when he bothers us for running water to play and drink in. When we took him to the vet for the vomiting, our vet said she does not like these fountains for pets."
3,Works Great Until It Doesn't,"Had it for 3 years. Was wonderful. My cat loved it up until the water pump died. It is good for pets, but it is low quality and high cost."
5,One of the best investments I've made in my cats!,"I've had this for a few years now and never had a problem. There was a brief time when the reservoir (the part the cats drink from) would overflow a bit, but I learned that I needed to put it on a flat, level surface instead of carpet. That fixed the issue. I don't have to clean it more than once a month and I have three cats. Once a month I take the motor apart and soak the whole thing with the motor in white distilled vinegar for 10 mins or so and after I rinse it and scrub it a little it's good as new. All three of my cats use it and love it, and so do I! I highly recommend this product to anyone whose cats don't drink enough water. It definitely encourages mine to drink more instead of them drinking out of the sinks and bathtubs."
4,Great to Encourage Water Intake,"My cats and I love the fountain!They drink much more from this fountain than they ever did from a dish. With kidney problems so common among cats [especially seniors], I consider this unit essential to encourage hydration - especially since I live in the arid southwest. And now they don't pester me constantly to turn on the faucet for running water!PROS: This Platinum unit's large built-in reservoir and better pump are huge improvements over the standard Drinkwell or other brands I've owned before. [It even holds plenty if you have to be away for a few days] The take-apart design is much better for a thorough clean up.CONS: It takes longer to clean all the nooks and crannies - you need both a large AND small bottle brush.It's a small price to pay for the convenience, better cat health and just maybe fewer vet bills too."
4,Out cat LOVES this water bowl,Great water bowl. Our cat loves it. Water enough to last almost 1 week. Only complaint is plastic will eventually show water stains (limestone) and hard/impossible to remove. Had a previous model that the water pump started making a LOT of noise. One call to customer support and a new pump arrived. So far this one is OK.
4,Good source of water for the cats,"Bigger than you might expect and very helpful to encourage cats to drink. The flow of the water draws them to it. You'll get used to the sound of the gentle fountain. Watch the screen near the intake for build-up. It's designed to keep hair and stuff away from the pump, and it will catch stuff. Watch the intakes of the pump as well. If they get too much ""stuff"" on them, the level will not be right and you'll come home to a wet floor when the water overflows. (Personal experience.) Clean the entire unit at least once a week or so. Harder water builds up on the plastic."
4,Incredible!,"I had originally purchased a PetCo brand ""moving water"" dish and was thoroughly disappointed. I had read great things about this and decided to grab one. It couldn't be worse than what I had.Since buying this my cats have noticeably started drinking more water, play with the fountain, the water always looks cleaner, and because of the large reservoir, I'm more comfortable that the cats are hydrated while I travel. My 13 month old also likes this model better than the old, but I think that's one of the reasons my finance does not like it.The only hang up with this model is that cleaning is more involved than a less ""complicated"" water fountain. I would rate this a 4.5, but I can't say it gets a full 5 until it stands the test of time."
5,The best fountain ever,"The first fountain we had was the Petmate Fresh Flow and the water flowed directly down a ""ski"" type path. The Drinkwell flows like water out of a faucet and our cat Ginger seems to prefer that method. It's easy to do the once a week cleaning and does not have to have a filter."
4,"So far, so good","We just purchased this a few days ago, but I'm very pleased so far. After our walks, my dog's first pit stop in the house was the toilet bowl. Since getting this, the toilet bowl has been long forgotten - he'll go straight to the fountain for a drink. He's a sloppy drinker, so it looks like I'll have to clean this out more frequently than recommended, but it's much better than the water bowls we've used before, which seemed to get dirty and stagnant quickly after the first drink. It was easy to set up and easy for the dogs to get accustomed to - within minutes our puppy and our friend's dog were drinking straight from the flowing fountain water."
5,Success!,"I bought this drinking fountain for my cats when I found out that I was going to have to be traveling more for work. My male cat has a tendency to knock over his water bowl, and if I am not there he and his sister will have nothing to drink. It took my cats about half an hour before they were really comfortable with this, but since then they love it. I fill it up about once a week, and Max and Mavis have a steady flow of fresh water. It is a little more complicated than putting out a bowl of water, but it sets my mind at ease to know that they always have water to drink. I highly recommend it!"
4,Better Than a Water Bowl,Easy to set up. Easy to disassemble for cleaning. Easy to refill. Easy to clean. Two of our three cats readily use the product. A third seems frightened by it even after a month. So it's not a panacea but that's no fault of the product's. Runs very quietly.
5,My cat loves this!,My cat is diabetic and loves her water. With this fountain she gets fresh water all the time and she loves the waterfall effect. The unit is easy to set up and maintain. I clean it thoroughly once a week and replenish the water as needed. I think most pets would enjoy this.
5,Best One Ever!,"We've had many fountains over the years and this one is the best yet. (The price was good also.) We also bought the fountain mat which fits perfectly around it and does a great job of keeping the drips off the floor, plus it doesn't require much space. Even the filters for it are much improved over the last model, since they are divided into sections, are sturdy, and easy to insert. Most of all both of our little dogs LOVE it! After we got the 1st one we immediately bought another one for the upstairs. [[ASIN:B000L3XYZ4 Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain]"
5,So Much Better . . .,"I originally purchased the $19 plastic teardrop fountain, but found it made so much noise, two of my three dogs wouldn't go near it. Plus, it spattered droplets of water everywhere and it discolored my laminate flooring. Needless to say, I was very disappointed.I then purchased this fountain and I say, ""Good on ya!"", Drinkwell! It is so quite, I can't hear it, although it's in my home office. It runs great, all my little dogs LOVE it, they're drinking more water, and I'm awesomely happy with it!It came within 24 hours, which totally surprised me, and the price was very affordable. I wish I had not tried to go cheap the first time. The Platinum Pet Fountain by Drinkwell is worth every penny, and I highly recommend it."
2,My cat ignores it!,"My cat ignores it, and it's quie noisy. Also, you need to change it often to guarantee fresh water. Better to have several water bowls and change daily."
5,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain,"Looked at several pet fountains in the store and online. Read the reviews on most of them on Amazon and this product seemed to be rated high so based on that information I decided to make the purchase. I have had it about a month and I love it. Very easy to clean, very, very quiet. The cats love it. They have even stopped jumping up on the counter to drink water from my dripping bathroom faucet. I would definitely recommend this product."
4,My cats love it,"I have had this product for a few years now.Pros:Encourages your cats to drink more water, cool looking (with an optional pump it glows from a blue LED), sound of running water.Fill it and with two cats it lasts from 4 days to a week.Base is very durable.Cons:Sound of running water (you may not like, might encourage humans to urinate more lol. I like the sound)It is not the easiest thing to clean and you must clean it every two weeks or it gets nasty.The fur is not trapped by the square plastic piece in front of the pump as designed.Tank is awkward to carry from sink to base.I had problems twice with the reservoir tank. It develops a problem where it loses its seal and floods the floor, they sent me a replacement for free but was a hassle."
5,Great product,We bought this for our 3 house cats to try to encourage them to drink more water. They were a bit afraid of at first but took at it after a day or so and all 3 drink regularly now. The best part...no more cats jumping up on the vanity wanting to drink out of the faucet.
5,Silence!,This is the quietest pet fountain I have owned (out of 4). My daughter's eight year old cat is drinking more and I don't have to listen to a loud pump. Great for both of us. The reservior is really large.
4,cats like it,"I've been using this for almost three years now, and my three cats drink from it frequently. One of my cats had crystals in his bladder at the time when I bought it, and since we got him healthy that time he hasn't had any issues of that sort. If you clean it regularly, it should last for a while."
1,Disappointed,"I really liked this product until I got crack in the water reservoir and couldn't get a replacement. They will sell you a new pump, lid, base but you can't get the reservoir. I wouldn't call something that can become totally useless if the reservoir no longer works Platinum. I will never buy another Drinkwell product again."
2,my cats do not use the fountain,"It is also hard to fill it with water, without spilling.I will try to change location, see if it helps.So far, no luck!"
1,One year lifespan!,"This died on me, after owning it a little over a year. Bummer. Not worth the price. Will go back to old fashioned bowls of water now."
1,Too Loud!,"My cats are afraid of it. They both love drinking out of the running sink but they won't go near this fountain. It's so loud, I have to keep the laundry door closed at all times (it has a kitty door) to be able to watch TV 2 rooms away. It's ridiculous! Whomever engineered this obviously doesn't have cats nor do they care about quality. It is very inexpensive and easy to build a simple and quiet water pump these days so there is no excuse for this. It's going back! So unfortunate."
2,Nice idea - - bad execution,"It is a nice idea, but one word - leaking...Glad I also chose to buy the Drinkwell Platinum Fountain Mat....or there would have been water all over the floor. Both items are going back."
2,Cats are terrified of it,"I purchased this on recommendation from my vet after my one cat suffered (and survived) an obstructed bladder, hoping to encourage him to drink more water. Unfortunately, both of my cats are terrified of this fountain, and now drink less water."
3,One serious flaw,after 3 days I noticed it wasn't working. I unplugged it and found the problem. Our dogs had chewed the power cord completely thru. I purchased armored steel wire cable and it's back up and running again. All dog products with exposed wiring should be required to have it. If your pet chews beware!
2,Awakard to clean,I really haven't seen my cat drinking at the fountain very often. I thought he would like the running water concept like he does the tub and sink water. I find the drinkwell very awkard to clean and then after I clean it and fill all the compartments it doesn't start runing it sounds like it is running dry even though it's not.
3,It got my cat to drink more water but has its downfalls,"I like this fountain overall...it definitely got my cat more interested in drinking water frequently. Also seemed to circulate the water more so it didn't get stale and I don't need to clean the bowl quite as often. However, even just a couple weeks of running the motor has gotten louder. Hopefully it doesn't continue..."
3,Surprised another called it quiet.,"I'm surprised that another poster called this fountain 'quiet'. It is anything, but quiet. It is so loud, on the lowest setting, that even after a year of owning it, I keep thinking I've left the kitchen faucet on.Another con is that the bowl is too small for the head of a large cat. My big boy constantly has a wet head. He's gotten used to it, but it is pathetic to see him drinking and watching the water shoot off his head!Overall, I think it is a fair product, it just isn't the one for me. I'm here looking for another cat watering system, one that doesn't keep me awake with the running water sounds and doesn't bathe my cat while he drinks."
2,I like it more than my cats do,"I have two cats, who both like to drink from the spout in the bathtub. Hoping to break them of this habit, i thought this product would be a great solution. Unfortunately they are scared to death of it. They won't go near it. Wonder if I can return it?"
2,TOO BIG!!!,"We have 5 cats and wanted to change over from the original pet fountain to this one since it claims to be quieter and better, but it is huge and makes the same amount of noise! If you care about your cats like we do then you will be unhappy to hear that there are a lot more parts to take off and clean and even though we bought the Drinkwell cleaning kit - it won't even reach all of the corners in the back tub! You literally cannot clean the lower corners unless you make your own cleaning tool or improperly bend one of them.Drinkwell is the only filtration system recommended by vets, so I would still buy their systems over others, but even with 5 cats this is way too big, too hard to clean and disappointing.We are sticking with our old model (even though it has begun to leak) and we are just going to replace the ring or motor if needed."
5,Excellent Product,"When our cat first started getting in the bathtub and meowing for us to turn on a trickle of water, we thought it was cute and entertaining. It got old quickly. The hair and bits of litter in the tub were no good and she became more demanding about it more often. Her waterbowl wasn't good enough for her anymore. She took to the drinkwell immediately and we all lived happily ever after. I take it apart and clean it every week, and it works like a charm. Highly recommend if you like your kitty!"
5,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain,"Has exceeded my expectations! My pets love it, I don't get anymore verbal abuse from my cats, at least in regards to their water,lol! My thanks to Drinkwell! Great product."
4,Does a good job,"These comments are from my thirteen-year-old who is the keeper of our cats:""It is fairly quiet, and I clean it once a week. My cats that previously wouldn't drink from a bowl drink from the fountain. It may take your cats a couple of days to get use to the fountain."""
5,Great product,"SO much better than the smaller one. I still think they can do better by having an even larger water capacity though. One of the best features is that you can turn the water up or down, which allows you to hear the water trickling or not. I feel less guilty by refusing to turn on the faucets with this around, even though the little fart still goes right to the darn tub faucet still...but a little less I guess."
4,"Great product, humming a tad loud","I'm glad I purchased this water dispenser for the sake of cleaner & aerated water for my cats. They were a little wary of the humming it produced, but I think their thirst overcame their apprehension. Eventually it just becomes another hum like the refrigerator or computer, blending into the background. I think since it's on my tile floor, I could place it on a small piece of thin dense foam (like the ones used in exercise routines) and the hum would be unnoticeable. With the added tank on the backside, the supply is ample, and I'm glad for the charcoal filters to rid their water of slime which was typical of their other water bowl that had stagnant water. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Thumbs up for Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain,"I have one cat that will not drink standing water and so I invested in the cheaper fountain probably four years ago. My cat liked the fountain but I sure hated cleaning the darn thing! I have arthritis in my hands and had a devil of a time getting the electric plug out of the bottom of the fountain.A few months ago I upgraded to the platinum version. I'm really glad I did for a number of reasons: the reservior is a great feature, particularly when I go out of town for the weekend; the fountain is MUCH easier to clean and I'm doing so on a weekly basis (I don't want to admit how infrequently I did it with the harder-to-clean version). The flow adjustment is much more sensitive too."
2,"Gets dirty fast, hard to clean","Our cat and basset hound both love the fountain. The wife and I don't however as it gets dirty quickly and is a pain to clean. The filter and filtering gate do a poor job of collecting the countless crumbs from dinner that the basset hound leaves when she gets her after dinner drink. I realize this could just be a factor of our particular dog, so take my criticism with that in mind. In a matter of days the main spill reservoir's bottom is covered in food fragments. To clean the unit, you have to pick it up and hope to not spill too much water on your way to the sink as you tear the whole contraption apart to clean out all the little crevices that collect grime. Then when you mop the mess you made, you get to refill it, and try to get the wimpy pump primed so it will flow. Every week when I clean it, I get more upset at it."
5,Works really well so far,I have had the pet fountain for the past month or so and have been happy with it. It is stored in my cat room and is not audible outside of the room. The water reserve is large and has a nice seal. You fill it up and close it off so that when you put it upside down in the water bowl it doesn't poor water everywhere which I find really nice. Overall I am very happy
5,Very quiet and just right amount of water noise,"They nailed it with the noise, I keep mine in my room and the noise of the running water is real mellow and calming even in it's highest setting. The motor noise is almost non existent the noise of the water is louder and my cat loves to drink from it."
2,great until it died,"Ordered in November, R.I.P. April 25th. Worked great until it went belly up. Cats loved it.....not worth the price if only lasts 5-6 months"
5,kitty,this Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain is the best! Our 9 yr old kitty we got at the local animal control center. I guess always drank in the sink. I just couldn't keep the water running. Anyway the Vet told me about the fountain and so I decided why not try it. Well she likes and I am very Happy!
4,loves Tuck,"We got the Drinkwell in record time. Set up was easy. We've had it four weeks, and I clean it every week as instructed. However, Q-tips work as well as the cleaning kit. Easy to disassemble for easy cleaning. Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel loves the ease of getting a drink and the quantity of water in the tank. No waiting for us to refill his water dish."
4,Does a good job of keeping the water fresh,This cat water product was recommended to me and so far I am very impressed with it's performance. If the water is not fresh my cats will walk away from it and this product keeps the water moving and my cats are very happy and drinking water from this and not trying to drink out of thetoilet.
5,My cat seems to like it and noise is not too bad!,"My cat wasn't sure about the well at the beginning but he starts drinking the water after a few days. The noise is not too bad as long as the top lid is completely closed, otherwise, the noise gets loud. The water holds up for a week+ for one cat. I highly recommend this product."
4,Drinkwell Platinum,Pros: Keeps water circulating and fresh. Tweaking the water flow allows you can reduce the noise. Holds more water than the pets bowls.Cons: Difficult to refill and awkward to empty.Conclusion: We use the Drinkwell in conjunction with our pets (two cats one dog) water bowls. With three animals you must clean the fountain every week otherwise it will become unsanitary. The OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush works great for this task.
3,"Nifty idea, rather high maintenance","One of our cats loves to drink from the flowing water faucet. We thought this fountain would be great for her. She does love it (and has lots of fun trying to figure out how it works), but it's rather high maintenance. Lots of pieces to fill and put together. Has to be taken apart, piece by excruciating piece, and cleaned once a week (!). There is a carbon filter, which we do not intend to replace. It is a lot of fun watching the cats approach the fountain (some more carefully than others) to see whether it's safe to drink or not. I haven't really seen any of them drink from the flow though, which is a bit disappointing since that was sort of the point of the thing. It's a lot of money for a novelty item. Plain bowls of water, or even a bistro-type water dispenser, seems to work just fine."
4,Very useful item,I have had this item over a year and it has been great. I am glad I purchased it before reading these reviews however. I think that some of the problems people list may come from not using it correctly. I think it is a wonderful product and my cat loves it! I have owned other Drinkwell fountains and Petmate as well. This is my favorite. I do agree with the one comment about the resevoir. It would be convenient if it stood on its own. Other than that I think it is great and would purchase again. I especially love the fact that it can be cleaned in the dishwasher on the upper rack.
5,Surprisingly quiet,"Quieter than I figured. I thought I'd have a mini-fountain in my house trickling, but it is whisper quiet and my dog LOVES IT! Large capacity water resevoir means I only have to tend to the dog's water 2 to 3 times a week."
4,Great water source for cats,"One of my 2 year-old cats has urinary tract disease - I'm desperate to get more water in his system and my vet recommended a fountain like this one. Since I didn't want to wait for shipping, I recently purchased it from a pet store (and I paid MUCH more than I would've from Amazon).It took both of my cats a couple of days to be more interested in the fountain than the box it came in, but alas they now drink plentifully from it.I haven't had it long enough to clean yet, but all parts (minus the pump) are dishwasher safe, so I'm sure it won't be too bad to do. This is a small step considering the benefits pets get by using it.Like another reviewer, I'm only giving it 4 stars because I would've preferred a ceramic or stainless steel option. The same cat that has urinary tract problems can also be sensitive to plastic. I hope this fountain doesn't trigger any of those issues."
2,Disappointed,"My cat and I liked the fountain a lot. But then after just a year the motor stopped working well. The water just dribbles and the lever that should make it flow more and less no longer works. Now after I have had it less than a year and a half the dribbling water is splashing out and off the mat onto the wooden floor. I have tried all sorts of cures - new filter, taking it apart, etc. Nothing is working and I have little choice but to get rid of it. My cat is going to be so sorry to not have it, but the Drinkwell is too expensive to replace every year."
1,Worked 5 whole months!,"Our last fountain (not the platinum one) lasted 4 years, and then we replaced it because those years of hard water had led to buildup that I could no longer get off. It otherwise still worked.This arrived in early March. A week ago it started making a terrible noise. Thinking it just needed to be cleaned, I unplugged it. A couple days later I cleaned it, plugged it back in, and absolutely nothing. It flat out will not turn back on. It apparently lasted just long enough that I can't dispute the charge with my credit card. We'll be looking at different types of fountains."
4,to fix it,For those of us with hard water try washing with white vinegar. Then run the base thru the dishwasher. Also if you pull out the small plunger on the lid prior to turning the water reservoir over it will stop your leak problems. A small strip of clear packing tape will keep the lid on and not show up. If you turn an end under it helps make it easier to remove later.. My only problem has been cleaning it often enough. When I don't the hair trap plugs up and the water runs over until the reservoir runs dry. But thats my fault not a design issue. I am ordering a new pump because mine finally died. A great product overall. I would highly recommend it.
5,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain,"This product is being used in a house with 3 cats. One of the cats always jumped up on the sink whenever the water was running and tried to drink from the stream. Now he has a stream all the time and no longer jumps on the sink. What a relief that is!It does take a little while to clean the machine, but it is worth it. I highly recommend this product."
4,Improved it a bit too much.,"I've had Drinkwell fountains for years and loved them, as did our cats. Time for another one, and upgraded to the Platinum model. It is bigger, with a better design in putting it back together after cleaning; however, it is really big. You have to have a very large sink, or clean it in the bathtub. It is very difficult to hold in one hand while wiping all the crevices with the other hand. Putting a filled reservoir back on the fountain requires more graceful moves than I have, so water goes everywhere. I liked the older model much better."
5,Water Fountain for Dogs,"I have four dogs and they have water dishes all over the house so I thought I would add this one just to spice up things for them. I have two American Eskimos, golden Labrador, and an elderly brindle boxer. It was fun watching them scout out this new water dish for a few days. The two bigger dogs kept dunking their heads into the stream and the smaller Eskimos would get scared when they would drink and it would gurgle. So that was all very entertaining. The good thing about it is that it cleans out all the stuff they seem to get into their water dishes. After about a week all four dogs use it regularly so that's a good thing. Most pet owners will know how frustrating it is when they buy a cool toy for too much money and the animal would rather chew on a leaf. My dogs use this so I'm not frustrated."
5,Great water fountain,"I just got this fountain 3 days ago and my dogs and cats love it. It was easy to set up. It's quiet and I can barely hear it running. I keep the water flow on the lowest setting, but even on the higher settings, it's quiet."
2,drip drip drip,"My cats will only drink fresh water, and this device has a large reserve.but The water drip sounds are as bad as a leaky faucet! Even on the lowest settings.I would not buy this one again, if I had a choice or asked."
2,not worth the bucks,"I bought this for my five small dogs, so I would not have to keep filling water bowls all the time.The problem is it gets dirty right away, & if you keep it filled, you have to dump a gallon or more of water to clean it. Also, when you go to refill the bowl, wayer goes all over the place, & while it was running, my unit would spash water on the floor. I finaly just unpluged it & used it as a regular water bowl until I got a real stainless larger one. I think I can find a lot of better uses for the $60 I spent for this thing."
2,"Dog didn't really care for it, then it broke","I purchased this for my yellow lab who prefers drinking running water (from water fountains, hoses, etc) to still water. For whatever reason, he didn't seem too interested in drinking out of it. In a side-by-side test, he preferred drinking out of his regular water bowl. No way for me to test it, but it could have been the noise of the unit. At the higher flow settings, the fountain is quite noisy, and even at lower settings, it's certainly audible.Eventually after about 2 months, the fountain just stopped working. Because it wasn't doing me much good anyway, I decided not to bother fixing the item. Could be this works well for cats (and some dogs), but I'd be cautious of the noise and durability issues."
3,Cat prefers eau d'toilet,"My cat would have nothing to do with this fountain. He looked at it, smelled it, then walked away to stand in front of the toilet, crying to have the toilet lid opened (his usual drinking hole). When we didn't give in to his meowing he walked away preferring to give up drinking rather than use Drinkwell. After two days of negotiating we gave in to his demands. Now he has returned to his old habits and we returned the fountain."
1,extremely loud,"I have three cats who absolutely refuse to drink from anything but a fountain or the tub faucet. I've always used a Petmate fountain before, but liked the water stream on this one because it looks like the water stream from the tub faucet. So I bought one. I read the reviews that said it was loud, but thought it would be like my fish tank filter where, once you got used to it, it was fine. However, this was not the case - it was VERY loud in a grinding sort of annoying way - and, yes, I did have enough water in it. I threw it out and bought another Petmate - don't waste your money."
3,Too small for dogs. Noisy.,"From the descriptions, I thought that this product would be larger. If I'd known how small it is, I would have bought the ""Big Dogs"" waterer. The pump is noisy, but I've had it for 6 months and it still works. I like the collection grate that does not allow debris into the pump. My cats and dogs love drinking from this product. They will not touch the regular water dish.I would definately recommend some sort of pet fountain."
3,Works well,Design makes this item difficult to move however it does work well and I am satisfied with my purchase. On second thought I should have purchase the old style Drinkwell fountain.
4,Great but it leaks,I love how much quieter this is than the old model .. I also love how it doesn't get as dirty as the original .. but it leaks and suddenly I find a pool of water under it. I had to buy a mat for it or my laminate floors would be toast.
3,Eh... Fresh water right?,"I am on #2 drinkwell same item. I like the idea behind it which is why I replaced the broken one. Being the second, I noticed this machine leaks like the other one did. I had to go buy a special plastic mat because it was ruining my wood floor."
1,Quit working after 4 months of use!,"I would not buy from this company again. Not just because the product completely stopped working after 4 months, but when I tried to find contact information on their website, there was none! How convenient for them - make themselves totally unavailable. If someone at the company reads this, it would be nice to have email and/or phone numbers available. I would be willing to send this back in exchange for a replacement, but have no way to do it. I guess I'll just take my chances with sending it back to Amazon and see what compensation they might give me.Not good business practice!!"
4,great waterer,The cats really like this water fountain. They were obsessed with drinking out of the sinks and now they don't bother anymore. So far so good.
5,Great for geriatric cats,"Bought this for my daughter's geriatric cat who needed encouragement to drink enough water. He absolutely loves, loves, loves this, and now is happy to drink plenty of water. Highly recommended!"
5,Perfect,"I read one review that the resevoir won't stand up by itself. People, that's why you have hands. :)This thing is perfect. I have 4 cats and a little dog. They definitely drink more water with this than any bowl I've had. The water keeps moving and therefore remains fresh due to the filter. I just cleaned it after a week of having it and it was a breeze. It took maybe 5 minutes. Just disassemble the entire unit, wash, reassemble.There is a slight sound of trickling water, but it's actually kind of calming. It doesn't sound like a faucet running or anything.Obviously, we love it. Make sure you put a rubber mat under it, though, so when you carefully turn over the resevoir, any slight leaking will be caught.Enjoy!"
4,Great product,"I bought the Drinkwell Platinum fountain for my two (now) 6-month old kittens. Before I bought it, the male kittie would knock over water bowls so he could play in the water. I kept buying progressively larger and heavier water bowls. The last water bowl was a large ceramic dog bowl. Eventually he grew large and strong enough to flip that over. I did some research online and learned about pet water fountains.The kittens like it and drink plenty of water. Cleaning the water fountain is a bit of a pain, but it beats mopping up water every day. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of five. The kitten no longer tracks water around the house. Now he flips over the dry food bowls and plays kibble soccer with his sister."
4,good water fountain,"while the quality of the materials in this product could certainly be better (the motor), it is still of above average quality.more importantly, it has encouraged my cat to drink more, which is ultimately our goal here.as a bonus, my cat has started to hold her paws under the flowing water when grooming herself. while the hair filter over the pool intake does a good job of catching hairs, the charcoal filter inside it filters the more fine grained materials. depending on the quality of the water you put in this device, it does a good job of recycling water.if you are concerned by this, you should get used to cleaning this fountain regularly. i dismantle mine weekly and wash it thoroughly."
1,Overflowing Drinkwell,"I should have read the reviews before buying this. I had the original Drinkwell and loved it. I gave it away and bought the Platinum. I actually wanted the original, but the store no longer carried it so I thought what could be wrong with Platinum. The water pressure never equalizes as it says and then the bowl overflows. I went to a different store and found the original so I bought it and the overflowing platinum is on it's way back to the store! Remember bigger is NOT better!"
3,"Good product, bad cat reaction","I have a cat with a chronic urinary tract problem and wanted to keep her drinking as much water as possible. I got this product after seeing it in stores and reading great reviews.My cat is, and remains terrified of the fountain. I have left it off for, yes, months and still she walks a wide path as if anticipating it springing to life again. I have had it for almost 6 months. I keep it clean and not running and have yet to see her go near it.So. Be forewarned. It seems to be a good product but don't assume from the reviews that your cat will understand that! I fear I spent a fair amount of money on an item destined for next summer's yard sale season.Boo hoo."
1,Platinum fountain problems,"Buying this product was a big mistake. It worked pretty well for awhile, and our cat likes it. However, it was quite noisy unless it was filled to the brim (that's the function of the clear plastic reservoir on the back). It has reached the point where the water cascades over the brim like Niagara Falls (then it's quiet) or else it is not leaking but makes so much noise my wife can't sleep with it plugged in. We are replacing it with the Drinkwell original, not as pretty but more reliable. Both fountains will get noisy unless they have enough water to make them happy. Why Drinkwell can't fix this is a mystery to me."
4,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain,"I purchased this pet fountain based on a friend having one for her cats and buying it on Amazon. The fountain is great and my cat loves it but still wants to drink out of a bathroom sink faucet, if I would allow it. This is a great product, but somewhat awkward to clean because of all the crannies in the fountain. I would recommend this for cat lovers, if you don't mind the cleaning chore. The fountain is quiet and easy to refill on the plus side."
3,Defective,"This was the second fountain I purchased , the first one being the next model down. After less than a week, it began leaking all over the floor . I took it apart and cleaned it, but it still leaked. My cats liked it well enough, but I just couldn't take a chance with another one. Amazon gave me a full refund. I won't buy another ."
5,Excellent filtered water fountain that cats love.,"Purchase was a replacement for same make and model that was many years old. The pump in the old model finally became very difficult to start. They claim the new pump can be opened and cleaned out which would definitely extend it's useful life. One of our 3 cats began to use our original fountain right away but it took the other 2 a few weeks to drink out of the top of the flowing water. Once they did, they loved it, and have preferred it to drinking from standing water for many years."
4,"Nice fountain, but not as silent as advertised","I bought this to give my cat an alternative to drinking out of the faucet. It did take him some time to adapt to it, but he is now drinking out of it, except he doesn't seem to drink the water stream like I was expecting. I added the cat grass adapter to it a few weeks ago, and it is growing very quickly. The water capacity is great, and it's very easy to set up.I bought the Platinum because of the advertised near silent operation and the water capacity. The motor does make a noticable hum, but I've had to set it up in the dining room, which is just off of the living room, so there aren't any walls to block the noise. It did start running louder last night, but I followed a recommendation on their website, shut it off overnight, and it's quieted down again this morning. It does need to be cleaned out regularaly...my cat's a Himalayan, so I don't doubt that it's picked up some hair in the filters."
4,works with my cat,"I see my 5yrold cat drinking more water, which is the reason I bought this item. Good product. But harder to clean/maintain than a bowl of water. That's why I gave it 4 stars. It said you can use a dish washer - top rack low heat but with my investment, might as well hand wash it every other week. Just a pain taking it a part to clean it that's why I gave 4 stars."
3,It was noisier than I expected,I was hoping that this water fountain would be as quiet as the description implied. It was noisy enough that none of my 4 cats or 2 dogs would have anything to do with it (even after several days)
4,Cat Fountain,"Nice fountain, vibrates a lot on the tile floor, but if the resevior is kept more than half full this stops. My cat loves it, drinks a lot more water than he used to. Definitely needs to be cleaned weekly, but it's not as difficult as some reviews make it out to be. Comes apart and goes back together quite easily."
3,Cat hates it!,"Tired if turning on faucet (and forgetting to turn it off!!) for my cat to drinkI thought this would be a great solution. Well, my cat won't have anything to do with it. Aside from this, it is somewhat noisy and a pain to clean and refill. Just unplugged it for now. May try again another day."
4,Works great if your pets will drink from it...,"This pet fountain is fantastic in that it's easy to clean and generally very quiet, and that it has a fairly large capacity for water. However, I have three cats and when I placed it next to their food, not one of them would drink from it. The only way one of my cats will go near it is if it's on an elevated surface, but even with training, they still prefer the fish bowl!"
4,Love it!,"It took about a day or so before my cats caught onto this, but they now love it. I hear my cats over there drinking water straight from the fountain stream all day long.And this is silly, so don't judge: I was trying to show my cats how to use it when I first turned it on and they were still afraid of it... and I must say that the filters make the water taste great!My cats are both drinking much more water now. It's also pretty low maintenance - filling a reservoir twice a week vs. changing out the water in the old water dish twice a day.There is *some* motor noise, but not enough to bother me. I also enjoy the trickling water sound in my home."
5,Quality product,"Since I had my cat he refused to drink from a bowl more then once or twice. He always had his face in the toilet, the sink whenever I used it or drink the remaining water in the bathtub after I took a shower. His pee smelled like concentrated ammonia all the time so I knew he wasn't drinking enough. I bought a petmate freshflow fountain well over a year ago and ever since my cat stopped drinking from the sink, toilet and bath BUT the thing leaked almost from the beginning... thanks to the stainless steel insert. At the end of it's life it had more sealant underneath then it could contain water and it kept on leaking. I didn't kitty to go back to his old habits or not drink enough so I went to my local pet store and got the drinkwell platinum. The joy!!! Easier to clean, can't leak because it's all plastic and it doesn't need to be leveled so the pump wont pump air. All in all it's a far superior product. The only downside is the color. I wish I could get it in black."
4,Glass needs to be an option,"I would have given this item 5 stars if the water reservoir had been glass instead of plastic. The plastic over time will get marked and look old especially if you buy the Drinkwell LED light that illuminates the water tank. I also bought the Drinkwell mat that I gave a 3/5 stars since it doesn't match the color of the actual unit. The filters do an above average job, the motor isn't too loud, and my 2 dogs drink more water than before. I think it's very easy to clean and have no other complaints. I would have spent a few more dollars just so I could have a glass reservoir."
1,Extremely disappointing and expensive,"It worked well for a while. It is difficult to clean without special brushes. After a few months something stopped working so that the reservoir will suddenly dump all of its water into the system and the whole thing overflows. It happens at random times and I can't figure out what the problem is. I am cleaning the pre-filter DAILY and it still overflows. It seems to work fine, and then one day your floor is covered with water. This was a very expensive fountain and should have performed much much better than it did."
3,Nice fountain but...,it took time for our cat to warm up to it. The water sound contributes to a peaceful ambiance. I feel i spent too much for this water source.
3,Very noisy fountain,"I purchased this fountain for my cat to replace one that was getting old. So far, my cat has not taken to it very well. I have only seen her using it two times in the past few weeks. I don't think it has a speed that she likes and it is very noisy. I have tried to encourage her to use it but she has preferred to drink out of a regular bowl that I placed in another room. I am dissappointed with the fountain and I may go back to using my old one."
3,yes and no,Cat loves it. Cleaned as directed and had to replace the pump in less than a year. Could try to jump through the hoops to get it replaced under warranty but poor kitty is staring at the empty fountain with a longing glance so it's easier to just cough up the $20+ to replace it now. Maybe the next one will keep working longer... Replacing pump is still better than buying another whole unit that may do the same thing.
4,"good product, providing your cat accepts it.","It provides 'fresh' water to cat cat since it is continuously moving. It also has a reservoir that contais water sufficient for a week. However, a cat has to accept this as a source of drinking water. Todate, my cat has not touched the water; This is after even adding ice cubes daily. S, as far as my cat is concerned, 'it's nor working for her'."
3,Drinkwell a little awkward to use.,"The fountain works well, BUT, it's awkward to remove and replace the water tank without spilling water everywhere. Also, it's easy to knock the top lid into the well as you remove the water tank."
4,4 Paws Up!,"Well designed product. Sturdy construction, easy to clean and maintain.Cat's enjoy drinking from the water stream and the bowl. I wish the motor was a bit quieter (so only 4 stars), although the cats don't seem to mind.It's comforting to know my cats have clean filtered water available for them throughout the day."
4,The cats love it.,This item works very well but if you don't like the sound of gurgling water this one might not be the one for you. It has a very large reservoir so it doesn't have to be refilled very often.
5,Does what it says.,"I have seven cats and worried about the water bowl staying clean. With the drinkwell fountain I don't anymore. The cats took to it fast (some slower, and some played at first). I kept checking for slime buildup and didn't find any in the 4 weeks before my first cleaning. Carbon filter can go almost 6 weeks because the cat's don't drool very much. I also use bottled water as we have hard water here. Cleaning was a snap with the special brushes. I advise getting them. I was having trouble with my cats throwing up their food and hair balls. I searched the web and found out that by raising their food bowls up so they don't have to bend down so much and the fountains ability for them to drink right from the higher falling water has solved that problem. I am amazed and my carpets are happy too, ha. I believe my cats are drinking more also."
4,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain Does the Job,"I have three cats, one with uninary tract disease. All cats drink more water now which helps keep them healthy. They love the fountain. The only downside on the fountain is that it gets a little messy changing and refilling the water."
4,Perfect for cats - Fair amount of work to clean,"This is a dream come true for my cats - Perfect in every way, clean, silent, wonderful. However if you are going to get one, it needs to be cleaned every 7 days, filter changed every 2 to 3 weeks, and to clean it properly, it takes some time."
1,Fountain spills over,"This fountain does not maintain a water level, but spills over instead. Got it about 2 months ago and couldn't understand why my rug was always wet. The foutain, when the tank is refilled, and replaced, will drain until it gets to the right level. Then, a little later, it will drain again and overflow. Yes, I followed all the instructions and the pump is in place and attached properly. Have to put it on a rubber mat with deep ridges. ."
5,Wonderful! My cats LOVE it!,"After having used the PetMate fountain for years, it is SO NICE not to have to struggle so much to clean this Drinkwell! The PetMate got slimy really quickly, was much harder to take apart and clean and did not interest my cats as much as this fountain. My two boys love to drink straight from the ""falls"" as well as out of the bowl. I like the sound the water makes (but I also like the sounds of streams and brooks, etc.), so if running water makes you feel like you have to heed the call of nature, this may not be the fountain for you. We are very happy to be using it!"
4,My cats seem to like it a little bit so far,"I got this fountain a few days ago. So far my cats are warming up to it, which is great. I cleaned it using the kit specifically for the fountain which made it much easier.Drinkwell 3-Brush Cleaning KitIt's not very noisy at all. I've got the fountain in my bedroom and the sound of water is quite soothing. But more importantly the cats seem to be liking it now. I still have their old water bowl out, so they aren't going cold turkey on this. The water still looks clean at the moment, but as I said before, my cats are still getting used to it.Try it out for your cat(s) if you like, just know that it might take a little while for them to get used to it."
2,Not worth the $ or effort,"Pros:All cats love it!(5 personal cats & about 12 cats who have been fostered here during the ~ 10 months we've had it.)Cons:Cumebersome & difficult to clean. Requires frequent cleaning. No way to mechanically clean (wipe/scrub) most of tank.About 1 month after I got it, negative feedback mechanism that prevents all water from running out of tank immediately after filling stopped working. When tank filled, water runs out into bowl & keeps running out until tank empty resulting in water overflowing bowl & onto floor. Thus extra large tank to hold extra water for more cats useless.LOUD. VERY LOUD.I CANNOT recommend this product.I can only hope it dies quickly as others have so that I can get a different one without feeling guilty."
1,Cats never touched it,"After hearing about so many cats finding this water fountain irresistable, I bought one in February. My cats like running water from a faucet as much as the next cat, but neither one of them ever seemed to take a drink from this new fountain. I ran it for about 6 weeks, but the reservoir water level didn't go down and I never saw them drinking from it. I finally disconnected it for good and am getting rid of it. It's just a little too large and a little too noisy to keep around for another try."
5,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain,"We purchased this Platinum fountain (approximately November 2007) after the motor on our original Drinkwell cat fountain failed to function after several years. We, and our two cats, really liked the original fountain, but the Platinum one is so much better! Better design in that my female cat cannot knock the top off the fountain (she used to do this so much we would just leave it off and she would drink out of the top of the fountain rather than from the stream itself!). It is also much sturdier, with a good capacity reservoir that again is cat-proof (again, my female cat would knock the reservoir off and we would have to bungee it on!) Also much easier to clean and keep clean, as we have very hard water that tended to build up deposits on the original fountain. Not as quiet as they say and can still hear the stream of water, but figure that feature we can enjoy as we would a relaxation fountain! Would recommend wholeheartedly!"
2,Worked great for Four Months,This is a great idea for cats. Mine loved this. It worked for exactly four months then the pump died. Not worth the price for only four months of use.
4,Holds a lot of water!,"I had a smaller original unit and my pet care giver forgot to fill it up - burned up the motor! I have two cats and clean and fill the unit once a week. Because it is larger than the original, its a bit bulky when trying to clean. Very quiet and my cats are both getting used to it instead of sitting in the bathtub waiting for me to turn it on for a drink."
3,Pretty Good,"I bought this for my dog to keep outside and keep her water fresh. It does circulate the water. It is supposed to have a senser or lever to stop the water once it reaches a certain level and that only worked part of the time, so before you know it, it would overflow, which is not too bad if it is outside, but inside would suck. It is also noisy so if noise bothers you, maybe not for you. The bottom line is my dog enjoyed it and made her drink more water."
3,"It's a shame, really.","This is really a good fountain, I have to admit. It was quiet and nice, and we got it in hopes our cat would drink some water. No such luck. What happened was they didn't touch the fountain and we had to return it. This is a good fountain, but our cats just didn't drink from it. I give this three stars because it is a good fountain. But don't waste your money if you think they won't drink from it. -From the daughter of the owner, sorry if this was harsh!! :) <3"
1,Color not as pictured,The unit appears white in the photo posted. It's actually speckled gray - not very attractive. This was not in any of the descriptions or clear from the photo so I wasted ~$40 in shipping both ways due to the lack of information on that. I'm sharing this so that others can avoid that problem.
1,Junk,Noisy piece of junk. Have to put it in the room with their litter box so as not to hear the constant whining of the motor. Save your money. Get a dog.
5,Great so far,"I received this high end water fountain and read the extensive instructions on upkeep. You will need to completely dismantle this unit at least once a month for cleaning and maintenance. The product itself is great. My two dogs immediately took to drinking out of the free flowing purified water dish. The unit is quite and keeps the water very cool. This fountain will allow my dogs to drink clean non stale water all day and will ultimately extend their lives. Isn't that what this purchase is all about? If you love your pets as i do mine, you owe it to them to pamper them a bit."
3,Platinum Fountain,"I bought this item because my cat loved to drink from the faucet, but she would not drink from the fountain"
3,"Loved this fountain, but after about a year the motor stopped working ! :(","I have loved this fountain from the get go and up until now I have had no problems, It is easy to clean and manage and my picky cat that wasn't much of a water drinker loved this fountain. Just 2 days ago the motor seemed to have died and I think it may be a short in the cord or something. Does anyone know if you can just replace the motor ?? I paid $60.00 for this one at Pet's mart and I really hate to get rid of it. I am not sure if I would buy another one just because it just didn't last that long.[...].Thank you"
1,Motor doesn't work right.,I bought this fountain in April. After 2 weeks the motor quit pumping. I cleaned it and then cleaned it again and it worked for a while. Had to clean it severeral times and each time it wouldn't work. Now it won't work at all. Went to find a replacement pump and I can't find one. I am very disappointed. Thought that since I paid for the platinum pet fountain that it would be better quality. Now I don't know what to do. Invest in another fountain. GRRRRRR! This is very frustrating.
5,Quiet and clean,"We bought this for our dog that needs to drink more water for health reasons. She definitely seems to think that the water is less stagnant than a normal bowl and drinks from it often. It's very quiet, too! It does tend to splatter a bit so make sure to protect your floor if necessary."
4,Drinkwell platinum is pretty good,"I bought this unit based on reviews, and the unit itself is stable, however I wish the low flow was a slower stream, and when you put theresevoir on it does leak, no way to tip fast enough. I was also under the impression that the unit filled from the resevoir however I have had to fill at the bowl to keep the unit to the right level. My cats are using it, however they still prefer the toilets. (I adopted abandoned kittens that were left in a house for a long, long time). Maybe with time, cleaning took 40 minutes should be quicker once I get use to it. All in all a good unit.Heather"
4,My cat loves to drink from the sink and now this Fountain!,"I bought this fountain for my new kitten (6 months old) because he is obsessed with all things water and I was having a hard time getting him away from the bathroom sink. I simply can't leave the water running all day for his enjoyment. I did read other reviews here and decided to spend a little more and go with the ""Platinum."" The unit works very well and is very quiet. I have the water stream on the lowest setting as if it was on any higher my kitty wouldn't drink from the stream. He does use it a lot, but, unfortunately, we still like the sink faucet!! Only con really is cleaning. I have yet to carry it to the kitchen without sloshing water all over. (-1 star for that) So far cleaning is simple - haven't had any slime build-up. Worth the price to keep kitty happy."
4,For the rich,"Actually didn't pay attention to anything other than buying another Drinkwell Fountain. Extremely pleased with it, just wanted one more. When the Platinum Fountain came, I liked it, then set it up and was impressed with the improvements. Holds more water, easier to put together after cleaning, and much quieter. The cats took about 20 seconds to get over being scaredy cats, and love it. Glad I have it. Will probably by another one.Pretty extravagant!"
1,"A good idea, but better implementation needed","This item broke almost immediately. It leaked water and the pump was loud and distracting. It's unfortunate, since the idea of fresh water for our pets was a very attractive idea, but I went back to the good ol' water bowl after this waste of money."
2,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain too noisy!,"I've had the Drinkwell Fountain for my cat, Jilly, about a month now & she still refuses to drink from it. Since she liked to drink from a running stream from a bathroom faucet, I thought she would love it. She ran her paw under the stream a couple of times & that gave me hope. It hummed from the beginning but seemed to start humming louder within a day or two. She became afraid of it after that. It is still plugged in, except for cleaning, just in case she wants to drimk from it. But I believe she will out wait me!"
4,Drinkwell Pet Fountain,"The product works well and my cat now likes to use it. Originally, the cat was wary of the hum of the pump and the moving water fountain. She was definitely curious about this new contraption and would not drink out of it while the water was running. So I plugged the Pet Fountain into an electric timer and set it to run when I knew she would be sleeping. My cat now routinely uses the fountain for drinking (when it is the OFF cycle). Good product, I like it and feel safe leaving my cat unattended for four or five days."
4,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain,"Previously we had the regular drinkwell fountain, our cat has been usingit since she was a kitten ( about 4 1/2 years ). We were having no problems withit and it worked fine. I thought it was time for a newer updated fountain soI ordered this Platinum one. I can't see a lot of difference in the actualperformance of. It does seem to be easier to take apart and clean. It hasa larger tank for water and unless you have more than 1 cat the smaller oneworks just fine. The reason I rated this one 4 stars was the price."
1,Sound of Water is LOUD,"There have been prior comments that this fountain is noisy. It is. The manufacturer talks about the motor and says it is loud only when it is not well-maintained. So, I bought it. However, the bothering noise is NOT the motor. It is the sound of falling water, which is inherent in the unit's design. Only buy this product if you love the sound of your kitchen faucet running. When this fountain is plugged in, the noise of water running is very, very VERY annoying. I used to have a PetMate where the water ran down a ramp. That design was much better. The free-flowing water stream in this unit makes everyone wonder who left the faucet running."
4,Great fountain,"My two ragdoll kittens (3 months old) started drinking out of thisthe second day we had them. Haven't had to clean it yet, but so farso good. the motor noise is minimal. You do hear the fountain streaming,and that's adjustable."
5,Encourages cats to drink more water,This product works as claimed. I find that it encourages my cats to drink more water more often. This is good because cats don't drink enough water. I am very satisfied with this product.
4,Awesome fountain,This fountain really helps entice the cats to drink more water. The filters are reasonably priced and it is easy to clean/maintain. I think the sound is pleasant as long as there is enough water in it. he loud noise in these fountains is cause by the pump having to work without enough water moving.
5,A+ on this one,"Had the old drinkwell, was a pain to clean and got all scummy and gross. This one is easy to clean, holds more water and our cat loves it."
2,very disapointed,"i was very happy with the purchase at first (I bought it in may 2010). my cats started to drink more and my male kitty even stopped having problems with frequent urination containing blood. however, couple months ago i started to have problems with powering it up after cleaning (was cleaning it weekly,taking motor out every time, because it was getting nasty despite using the filter). finally, it stopped powering at all. i ordered motor replacement for $18. power cord was included. it worked for couple weeks and then same thing:problems with powering up and then stopped working. Now it is just sitting in the kitchen and serves as a regular water bowl. was i cleaning to much? but it was so dirty! will look probably for another brand. My kitties missed a lot the running water."
4,Pretty good overall,"The fountain has performed well over the past 2 weeks and seems to keep the water fresh with the filter provided. Of course I have a whole house water filter so the water I put into the fountain is already pretty good. The cat loves the sound of the water as it falls and seems to be getting plenty to drink as evidenced by his litter box. My only negative comment and the reason the fountain did not receive a 5 star rating is that the pump is pretty loud. I keep the fountain full and even so the pump can be heard from my kitchen all the way into my bedroom some 30 feet away. During the day it's not as big a deal but at night when I like it nice and quiet I can hear the humming noise of the fountain pump. But, overall it is a good quality item and I expect years of good service."
5,cat's meow,I have owned the Drinkwell brand pet products for at least 7 years now; each year they continually improve on their products. The Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain is by far their best yet. The new gate that keeps my cat's hair and etc... from getting into the motor is one of the main reasons that I bought the new model even though the last model still works fine.
5,What took us so long????,"We first bought the Petmate Deluxe because it was at the local Petsmart market and because of price. Boy do you get what you pay for! The Petmate was horrible from the get go. We stuck it out for almost a year before upgrading to this wonderful wonderful drinking system. I mean from the moment we plugged it in I noticed a difference. We live in Southern California where it gets plenty hot, so we wanted a fresh water system for the boys (Charlee and Julius) this system rocks. It keep the water fresh and cold and unlike the Petmate it actually flows! I wish we had just bought this fountain from the beginning! Trust me. Get this fountain. YOu will not be disappointed!"
4,Everyone likes it (even the dogs),"So far, this has been a very nice fountain. Yes, it is a pain to keep clean, and I sometimes feel foolish having this(do they really need a fountain? Are there fountains in the wild?) Having said that, Everyone (except me) is drinking from it. I have had a different style, but I have cats that like to play in the water, and so far it has resisted all efforts to knock off the top, knock off the water container, or make a big puddle. I did buy the fitted fountain mat, and that helps with the splashes. I use filtered water ( I am on a well, and unfiltered water damages kettles, humidifiers, coffee pots etc) so I will probably not replace the charcoal filters. They are quite pricy. The dogs can empty it pretty quickly. (they don't think it is just for the cats) Great price from the Amazon warehouse."
5,So Wonderful!,"Length:: 0:48 MinsMy kitty started getting sick due to allergies, I noticed he wasn't drinking water unless directly from the sink faucet. After numerous trips to the vet I decided to invest in this fountain. It took him a good couple of minutes to sniff it out and I was completely satisfied with the results. Thanks to the great feedback and choosing the right product I am so happy. He has not sneezed or had a hairball attack in days since receiving the shipment! I'm so happy."
4,Great fresh water,This is a great product. My dog & cat love having fresh water available all the time. It has a good capacity too. It has a very quiet motor except when it needs to be cleaned. It sounds like a water feature in the house when it is turned up high.
4,My cats love it,"My cat's Hedy and Hopper both went for this fountain. Hedy would only drink from the faucet and Hopper would only drink from the toilet, they would wait for me to go to the bathroom where I'd have to turn the faucet on for Hedy and flush the toilet for Hopper. I got them this fountain so that they wouldn't have to wake me up in the middle of the night when they were thristy. I set it up and they both spent the next half hour entranced by it. The only problem was that they disconnected the power cord (there is a quick disconnect feature which disconnects the cord if the cat pulls on it). I tucked the cord out of the way but I may have to use some electrical tape to disable the disconnect feature if they do it again."
5,Love this fountain!,"My vet recommended a fountain for my newly adopted wild cat since it wasn't drinking enough water. My older cat had tried a fountain before and wouldn't use it, so I researched a while before deciding on this option. The new cat immediately took to the fountain, but my 9 yr old was stubborn. This fountain has a feature that allows you to raise or lower the water volume, and I put it on the lowest setting. After a few days, he finally got used to it. Now the water volume is almost at medium, and he loves it! Not sure if the older cat would have gone for it if the adjustable feature wasn't there."
1,"Terrible. Nearly impossible to clean, and very fragile.","I tried to return mine to Amazon but the return window is only one month; it broke at nearly exactly two months. So I can't return it. The problem with this unit is its poor design for cleaning. Since the biggest reason I bought it was for my cats' health, this creates dirty water fast. And for some strange reason, the power cord separates at about mid-point, which means you can't run this behind any large appliance to get to that last available outlet.This is a good idea, but it is most definitely not ready for general use. My wife and I are terribly disappointed."
4,Just what I was looking for,"Just what I was looking for, saved about 20+ dollars from what the pet stores where charging for the same item. Arrived very fast."
5,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain,"My cat enjoys this fountain. It does not splash out and it holds a nice quantity of water. I would like it to run just a little slower, overall, I am happy and so is my cat."
3,Not as happy with this as I expected to be.,"The problem with this product as far as I am concerned is that there isn't an easy way to pick it up from the floor when it is full of water and needs to be cleaned. No ridges on the sides or handles. You have to try to ease your fingers under the bottom of the dish in order to lift it. Don't like that about it. Also don't like that when you refill the water container and turn it right side up, there is water loss from the bottom onto the floor. I wish the stainless steel 360 had been out when I bought this. I hope that it will prove to be a better product."
5,Quiet and clean water,"Have had this about 3 months now, and my cat really likes it. He wouldn't get enough water from a normal bowl, because it would stagnate and he would have his hair all over it which would have him avoid drinking after the water had been sitting more than 2 hours. This flowing water bowl has no issues with stagnant water, and the little filter gets almost all of his hair out. The motor is very quiet, I don't really notice it, but it will get louder if you let the levels run too low. No real complaints, but I will say that the reservoir seems a bit silly, most people will just pour water directly into the drinking area, but since the reservoir doesn't damage anything, I dont have a problem. Worth buying."
2,Can't get the cat to use it!,"Our cat loves climb up on the counters and drink from the sink faucets, but of course, someone has to be right there to turn the water on and off. We thought the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain would be a terrific alternative, sort of a self-service water fountain that he could access independently. For some unknown reason, he just doesn't want to drink from it. If anyone else has had this experience and found a solution, I'd love to hear about it. Otherwise, it's pretty much useless to us."
2,Cat completely uninterested,"The item was in perfect condition however my cat refused to drink from it. I tried to remove his old water plate, then he stopped drinking water completely. The fountain being on/off made no difference. I got this in hopes that it would attract my cat to drink more water but it had the opposite effect. He began drinking water regularly again the moment I returned his old water plate. I suggest you be wary that if your cat isn't already a flowing water drinker this item may or may not interest your cat. (My cat never tries to drink from the sink)"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Worked ok for a couple weeks then started leaking. Also, I don't think it ever really filtered. Ended up tossing it and buying a different kind."
3,"Great product, a pain to clean","I have had my Drinkwell Platinum fountain for a couple of years now, at least. I've never had any problems with it leaking, or not working, nor have I had it be too loud (unless it is low on water, then it gets loud...that has been my signal to refill). My only complaint is how much time it takes to clean, and still don't get it clean the way I like it. I'm ready to replace it...simply because I don't like cleaning all the cracks and crevaces! But otherwise, it has worked very well for me."
1,Loved it til it quit working!,I received this item along with the cleaning brushes I purchased seperately. I have not even had it more than a month and the motor (I think) has stopped working. I took great care in making sure I cleaned it and followed the instructions on it's care and use. I hope the company will contact me regarding this product and possibly replace it.
3,my cat is affraid of it,it seems fine. but my cat is afraid of it. she only drank out of it once when the pump was off. I wish the waterfall was farther back to give them more room to stick her head in it. she thinks its going to hit her when she puts her face near the water. (at least thats what appears to be the case)
3,"Good product, so far","My four cats are definitely drinking more water than they did without the Drinkwell after they overcame their fear of it. The motor is occasionally very noisy, and this seems somewhat tied to the amount of water spouting from the waterfall. I am cleaning it regularly, though I haven't noticed any fur or debris caught in the motor.Last thing of note: This is actually the second Drinkwell I purchased. I sent the last one back immediately. It simply did not work. The motor hummed but no water ever spouted. I had no problems returning the first."
2,Difficult to clean and very loud,"I loved this pet fountain when it first came because it holds a lot of water, which is great if you go on a short vacation. It was also easy to set up.However, the water gets dirty very quickly (I have two cats) and it's a pain in the butt to clean this machine. It holds so much water that it's heavy to carry to a sink and inevitably water spills on the floor. The sloping angle of the clear reservoir in the back makes it difficult to fill because you can't really set it down on anything - you have to hold it with one hand while filling it with water.Finally, the machine has become very loud over time. We try readjusting various components, which seems to make it quieter for awhile, but it's quite mysterious to me why it will suddenly starting humming very loudly."
5,Great product,"We were using the regular bowls and filling them twice a day...but we found this product and really enjoy the convenience - as well as knowing that the cats are getting fresh, filtered water throughout the week. It seems they are drinking more water this way, too. At first, the male cat (Zain) was fascinated with the waterfall. Very funny. He's calmed down a bit - and they both aren't afraid of it."
2,Runs fine but poorly engineered,"This product runs smoothly. It is so poorly engineered, however, that we stopped using it after about two weeks and will be returning it. It is very heavy, especially when full of water. There is no place to grip the machine, so it is hard to lift or move. You need to clean it out periodically, of course, but the opening from the water tank does not seal itself when you remove it, so all the water spills out on the floor unless you carry the whole thing to a place with a drain."
4,Water Fountain Wonderful!,After using the Cat It dome water feeder and struggling to keep it clean and full - a friend recommended the Drinkwell and what a difference! It is very easy to clean and doesn't have a lot of pieces to get filmy. The motor is inside which helps as well! Plus you fill it and forget it for a week! I highly recommend this product!
5,Great fountain for my cats!,"I bought this fountain for my two cats who are faucet drinkers. We keep in in the bathroom attched to our bedroom (no door between) and it is quiet enough that it does not bother us when trying to sleep. It took a short time 2-3 days for my cats to get used to it, one was a bit more nervous at first, but now they love their constant flow of water. It is easy to refill, disassemble, clean and reassemble. Definately a worthwhile purchase for my spoiled kitties!"
4,Good Water Dispenser,"I delayed buying the water fountain because I did not think the cats or the dogs would adapt to it. I was wrong about the cats; they love the flowing water. The dogs...only my Chihuahua will drink from it that I have personally seen. The Boston Terrier and my circus ugly midget of a dog have not been spied using it. I purchased this so I wouldn't have to be filling two water bowls in the house daily. The fountain has to be filled every 2 to 3 days but the upside is that I put lots of ice in the container and the cats love the icy water that flows. The downside is the cleaning of the motor, filter and what all has to be done once a week and that is time-consuming. The filter, while kind of pricey, only needs to be replaced every 3 weeks or so. I would rate this higher if I personally knew the dogs were using it."
4,Mostly OK,"I have 2 of these, mostly because it is such a pain to clean these all the way. The design has too many nooks and crannies, and too many 90 degree corners. The corners should be rounded off so cleaning will be possible. I have put the parts in the dishwasher and even that does not remove the black in the corners. I don't think it would take that much work to improve the design and make it near perfect."
1,Keep it clean or it will overflow..,"The cats love it but if you don't keep the filter clean, it will overflow all over your floors. Since I have hardwood floors, I purchased a jumbo foil roasting pan to keep the fountain in just in case I forget to clean it and it overflows. Will wait until it quits, then buy a different fountain. I purchased this to replace my old Petmate freshflow which would clog quickly but never overflowed all over the floors."
2,Drink well platinum fountain,Not happy with this model and have had multiple problems either overflows or does not run at all.have bought this brand for many years and it appears the quality has dropped and parts are more flimsy.have had to return several units due to problems so I suggest looking for another brand
4,Cat Pleaser,My cat seems to enjoy her new gift even at 18 years old. It is fairly quiet and the cord is about 3 feet and may limit where you can set it up. The water seems to stay pretty fresh and never runs dry. I still clean the base once a week as it can become slimy. I am not convinced the filter adds benefit and sediment/food particles settle to the bottom of the dish. I doubt I will purchase more filters. The convenience of not having to tend to the water bowl frequently is wonderful. The reservoir tank drips as it is inserted into the base. A big minus since not user friendly for children. The flow adjuster lever is very flimsy so use a gentle hand. This is still new to my houselhold but am pleased to see a happy cat and hope it holds up over the years.
1,Worse than catit water system.,Bought this because the CatIt fountain was getting too much slime IMHO. Turns out this fountain gets more slime than catit. You cannot leave this for more than 3 days or the build up is too much.
3,Replacement pump unavailable,"I have owned this fountain for over 2 years. My cats love it. My biggest complaint is that the pump broke (again!) and the replacement pump is unavailable-- the official website has had it listed as ""out of stock"" for months. I contacted the VetVenture site, with no response. Very disappointing. I do not want to use the PetMate pump as an alternative because it prevents flow control and filtering."
2,Did not last long.,Good Idea but I only used it for not even 2 months and the it stopped working. Also my dog was a little afraid of the noise it made at first.
3,Disappointed - must be cleaned every two weeks,"I have to clean this machine thoroughly every two to three weeks or else it builds up a white film. I'm not sure what's causing this, but I do replace the filter regularly. I figure it could be that the plastic doesn't have any antibacterial properties - perhaps in future models the plastic could be infused with silver particles. With a name like Drinkwell Platinum, I'm disappointed. I only bought this because there weren't any better choices in this price-range. I would gladly pay double to triple the time between servicing.By the way, I HAVE to clean it every two weeks, or else my cat turns up her nose and refuses to drink water, which quickly causes her to develop a Urinary Tract Infection.Also, I clean it with steaming hot water, not bleach. Perhaps if I used something a little stronger it could go longer in-between cleanings. I don't like exposing kitty to chemicals though."
2,cat's puzzled,"I'm not sure if my cat even drinks from the fountain. I find the fountain difficut to clean, it's awkard picking it up and bringing it to the sink to clean. after I clean it I fill the entire unit with water and for some reason it takes a bit to finally have the water start flowing even though I fill every area."
3,"Some improvements on the original, but new problems","I bought the Drinkwell Platinum to replace an original Drinkwell that was wearing out after years of faithful service. The unit is handsome, and I appreciate the larger reservoir, which cuts down on the frequent top-ups. I was also excited that this model has a pre-filter to catch pet hair and other detritus that can quickly muck up the older model.However, the filter presents a new maintenance concern. It must be removed, cleaned, and replaced frequently to avoid a nasty spill. When pet hair collects and blocks the filter, less water is able to circulate, and the reservoir begins to empty to replace what the unit thinks is a low water level. The result is an empty reservoir and a huge water spill out of the main basin.As a result, this model requires just as frequent maintenance as the older model. This isn't a fatal flaw and might not be a problem for everyone (if you have a hairless pet), but buyer beware!"
1,It died after 11 months,"The fountain was OK while it still worked - although it was very difficult to clean. However, after 11 monthes its engine died, so the whole thing stopped working. By the time we got ourselves to sending it somewhere - the 12 months guarantee expired (and besides - they probably would have told us we didn't clean it often enough - which admittedly we did not)It was also very big and cumbersome.[...]"
5,great job drinkwell,"Having read several of the reviews for the drinkwell platinum I decided to buy it. Amazon had the lowest price as well. What a difference from the original! I have been going through fountains like crazy and I finally found one that not only has a gigantic water reservoir but is so much easier to clean! It all comes apart so easy so you can really get down to the parts that accumulate the hair and sludge. I do wish it was stainless steel or ceramic though. It's better for the cats and easier to clean than plastic. Other than that it's a wonderful fountain. I bought 2. I have 3 cats and they are quite happy. The size of the unit was shocking at first, but I am happy that I don't have to fill it up all the time or buy an add on reservoir. It is a quiet unit, though I have it turned to the middle so I can listen to the slight sound of a waterfall. There's a little something from this fountain to make us all happy!"
4,My cats love it,"My cats love the Drinkwell. I've had it for almost two weeks now. It took them less than a day to get used to it and drink out of it. The first couple hours after it was set up were hilarious because one cat was so upset about the water he kept trying to hit it with his paw but got wet instead. Anyway, they drink so much water now, I've noticed. My only problem is I have to keep refilling the base every couple of days because the reservoir never empties out. It just stays in the container and sits there. I don't understand why it does that. I even moved it to another portion of carpet to make sure it wasn't an issue with the floor being uneven. Does anyone have suggestions? I've gone through the FAQ at the drinkwell site and there is nothing regarding the reservoir not properly working. Any suggestions are very welcome."
4,My cat loves this!,"Today, I found my cat playing with the free streaming water fountain and drinking directly from the water flowing from the spout. It was the cutest thing! I have a pretty skittish cat, but he really likes the fountain. The only thing is that it can be a bit loud at times, especially if the water is running low, and you have to refill it around every 10-14 days."
1,Poor customer service,"I have had to exchange 3 of these unit due to1. The motor stopped working after a few months .2. According to the manufacture the reservoir stopped making a food seal and dumped all ...yes all...of the water in the unit onto my hardwood floors.....that was bad .3. I notice a crack and a leak on the replacement unit for the second time .The customer service dept for drinkwell stopped being nice to me since I was returning all these items .Look elsewhere , they only support their product when you threatening to write a poor review"
5,pet fountain,"Product came promptly, works well and dog is drinking more water (which is healthy for him). I would recommend this to a friend."
2,Another failed pet fountain,"This worked ok until the motor failed a few months after I got it. Thankfully I'm handy and repaired the motor. It worked for about 10 more months, then began leaking uncontrollably. I would clean the entire thing, refill the water, and wake up in the morning to find out it either overflowed or leaked everywhere. It's going in the trash now, I'm tired of it."
4,if you have to pamper a cat with running water,"Cats survived for decades without drinking fountains, but my wife thinks the cats like it, so I bought this one to replace another that was the victim of a power surge. This one is quieter than previous one. Easy to clean and refill. Cats do use it frequently. So if you must, this one is a good choice."
1,"worked for a few weeks, then began to leak","This item worked well for a few weeks, then began leaking badly. It needs refilling on a daily basis since the water ends up all over the floor. So now it sits in the garage, unused. We have cleaned the filter and bowl regularly in case of clogs, but that doesn't help. There are no cracks or broken spots that I can find, it seems to be coming out from the reservoir behind the machine. We had the previous model for years with out a problem, so I can only guess that this is an issue with the new design, since lots of other reviewers had the same experience. I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews. Read them before purchasing, it could happen to you, too!"
1,Doesn't last but a couple of months,"When I first set this Platinum pet fountain up, I was thrilled with it. Now, less than 4 months later (with proper cleaning and care) the pump quit and a new pump is nearly half the price of a new unit. Bummer!"
2,Benefits aren't worth hassle of weekly cleaning,"The product works pretty much as described. I didn't notice my cat using it any more or less than a bowl of water. However, the issue I have with the product is that you need to clean it at least weekly and that takes about 10 to 15 minutes to clean it properly (yes, I bought the cleaning kit for this unit). After doing this for about 6 months, I decided it was much easier to just dump and refill a bowl every day which only takes about 15 seconds. If cleaning the unit only took a couple of minutes, I would probably still be using it. Perhaps Drinkwell could improve the design to eliminate the time it takes to clean this unit and then it might be worthwhile. For now, I'll stick with the ceramic bowl."
4,"Great, but needed a larger one.","My cats love this! However, this size wasn't really big enough for my 2 kitties. I had to refill the tank much more frequently than I wanted to. Also, after using this for 2 years, Wisconsin's hard water pretty much destroyed the motor (with regular cleaning). I have since upgraded to the big dog version and am much more pleased. I also make it a point to use either bottled water or filtered water so my motor doesn't fail."
4,"Loud, but gets the job done","The cats seem to drink more water than before (so it does the job for which it was purchased), but this thing is LOUD. It sounds like someone left a faucet on in the house."
2,Loved the first--second one died in 6 months,"My first one lasted a couple years without any problems, until the motor died. This second one didn't even make it six months. Sad. Will see what I can do to get a replacement motor."
3,not so good at 4000 feet elevation,"The Drinkwell Platinum works fine, except that water level is usually at, and occasionally over the top of the bowl. Why, you ask? Probably the combination of the relatively hard aquafier water in this region (southern New Mexico) and the elevation of 4,000 feet. (Remember that high school physics lesson about atmospheric pressure pushing down on everything --- we just have a little less pressure here at 4,000 feet.) So, I give the product three stars, since the manufacturer didn't mention this limitation."
1,This Product May Cause pneumonia,I have been noticing my cat having difficulty breathing every time after drinking from her fountain. I was told by a doctor that this is really dangerous for the cat as she might get pneumonia. The problem with breathing happens because the water goes to her lung after each time drinking. Please don't buy this product. I am going to return mine.
1,VERY POOR WOULD NOT RECOMEND,"NOT A GOOD PRODUCT FOR DOGS , IT SCARES THE ANIMALS . THEY WILL NOT DRINK OUT OF IT . I CAN NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE"
1,No support when pump fails,"When the cheap pump in this product fails expect no support - the company, Drinkwell, doesn't even have a website. At $60/year to replace the product I'll just leave the faucet running."
2,water bowl,"I must not have read the fine print well enough, because I was under the impression that the water had a resource tube to connect to a faucet or spigot, but instead you fill up the reservoir and just plug it in to circulate the contained water, and it does not bring in fresh water so you still have to make sure there is enough water to last. I purchased it so when I went away for a weekend I would know my pets had enough water, but without a water source, it's still a finite amount. Disappointing."
2,Don't Buy for Convenience Sake,"I bought this fountain for the sake of convenience, but what I did not realize was that scum would quickly build up on the inside surfaces that are in contact with water. After about a week or two, the inside of the bowl would feel slimy, and I would feel the need to clean it. Even using a dishwasher to clean it I found it was too much work to be worth using, so I switched back to bowls filled with brita pitcher water, and now the fountain has a spot in the top of the storage closet. My cat did not seem to drink more or less when the fountain was in use. I'm not sure whether the scummy buildup on the plastic is harmful to cats or not, but it just made the fountain seem gross.Other than that, the fountain seemed to work very well. It is a good design, and the plastic is of high quality."
5,water fountain,This is a great water fountain for my cats. It is not noisy at all and holds a lot of water. My cats love drinking out of the free flowing water fall. I highly recommend this fountain to anyone that wants a good working water fountain for their pets.
1,"Very Loud, Scares Cats.","Reading the reviews, this seemed like a good purchase. We bought it, followed all instructions setting it up and put it up and running 3 days ago. The pump is about as loud as a fridge and randomly gets very loud, where I can hear it from the other side of the house. Takes a small tap with my foot to make it quiet down.Needless to say, the cats are scared to death of it. They have not tried to drink from it, and when they walk by it they try to put as much distance from it as they can. Just I begin think they are not as scared of it, it gets VERY loud and they start to freak out again. For $40 bucks, this is ridiculous. This will be sent back."
1,Buy a large tub with this product,"Worked fine for a short time, cats loved it, a few days after cleaning first time, found water all over the kitchen floor, would not stop running over. Checked everything I could, took apart, started over, still would not stop running over, solved the problem, now resting in county dump. Would not recommed this product unless it's in a large tub!!"
2,Too loud to recommend,"Love my Original Drinkwell, but when a clueless housesitter melted my reservoir in the dishwasher I decided to upgrade. The Platinum's motor is much louder than the Original. If you're getting this for your garage, God bless you, but if you want to live with it in an enclosed space, think again. It will drive you crazy."
2,BUYER BEWARE: Amazon Refund Insufficient + Quality Issues,"Bought one in January--still working great and 2 cats love it. Bought second in April; pump impellers seized up in less than 4 weeks, despite appropriate cleaning and handling. Amazon replaced. Replacement pump did same thing in same time frame. Amazon won't replace a second time & is only refunding 80% of the purchase price. Don't understand the source of the problem; wish I could find a second one that works as we have 2 houses and want one in each."
3,Great for multiple pets,"I purchased this fountain for my kitten. It is very large and difficult to clean all the parts. The pump was continually slimy and after two days of being cleaned, I had to clean the fountain again. Since I use bottled water, this can get expensive. My kitty didn't really care for this fountain and tried to avoid the running water that would splash his head, he loves playing in water, but not having the flow go into his head. The fountain is quite loud and should be put somewhere where you can't hear it. Cleaning the fountain was an hour long process. If you have multiple pets in the home, it makes sense to have a larger fountain, but for just one kitty, it is too big and doesn't justify the cleaning or water waste from having to clean it every two days."
3,Plastic not Metal! A little Noisier than Expected!,"First off, judging by the Name ""Platinum"" & by the Picture, I thought it was some sort of metal. It's Grey Plastic! It works fine, but the motor is a bit noisier than me or my Cat would like. I have a timid Cat & she would not go near it for 2 weeks probably because of the Motor hum. I also wish you could set the Water flow rate even lower than the Lowest Setting available. I thought it was a little pricey, even at this discount rate, for what you get. But it does what it's intended for, so I gave it 3 Stars."
2,poor material,"The plastic material used accumulates mold and gets dirty way too often. It doesn't take long for the reservoir to stink and not be able to get rid of it. The cats do love drinking out of fountains, though."
2,"Nice product, but cat won't use it.","Just a short review.The product is very easy to assemble. Really isn't very loud if you put everything together properly and let the water balance. It's a similar noise as any other small desk fountain. You will hear a motor and the water running. The loud noises only happen when the water levels are wrong. It's rather large and does splatter a little tiny bit.However, my cat won't touch it. Sniffed and then never drank from it. After giving her no water for a bit less than a day and her obviously willing to die of dehydration rather than drink from the fountain, it's now, sadly, part of a give-away box as I'm well past the return date.So, to owners who haven't used 'fountains' before with their pets, try it fast... if your pet won't drink from it, send it back!"
2,Disappointing Buy,"I have had this fountain for almost 2 months now, and my cat still hasn't used it. I know it says it may take time for animals to get used to it, but Im beginning to think this was not a good buy. My cat continues to drink out of his regular bowl, and will wait for his regular bowl even if he is thirsty. Im not saying its not a good product, but in my case my cat is either too picky or scared to drink out of it. Out of my experience, I give it two stars for being nothing but a cute decorative fountain."
4,Good feeder with large reservoir.,"We had purchased the smaller Drinkwell pet fountain,Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain, and felt it was little on the small side, so we upgraded to this fountain. We have two large cats, and live in a dry climate (Nevada), and found the other fountain just didn't have enough of a reservoir to keep us from having to constantly refill it.This fountain was easy to assemble, and it runs quietly with the motor properly adjusted. The cats seem to enjoy it, too - most cats seem to like to drink out of ""running,"" water. Additionally, we have had relatively few problems with it mechanically, but sometimes it can be difficult to fill the reservoir and get it back on the fountain without spilling. It's not a REAL problem, though, as the spilling is usually minimal given some due care.Other than its cost, it's definitely a step up from feeding cats out of bowls of water, and it's been generally been a nice, reasonably-priced addition to our pets lifestyle."
2,motor is definately a problem,"My son owns the original Drinkwell. I saw how much his cat enjoyed it and found the sound of falling water is restful. When I purchased mine I upgraded to the Platinum because of the larger water basin. Unfortunately, since this fountain does not mask the sound of the motor (or they are equipped with cheaper motors) the sound is very annoying. I am going to order an original drinkwell and hope the motor noise is not so loud."
1,Not so good with time...,"I have had this product for over a year now, and it has caused me so many problems. The first months were great, but the cleaning process is tedious work and takes much effort. After about 8 months, there was a giant pool of water around the fountain. I kept using a towel underneath it, but it would mold easily. I am still using this product, but only because if I use anything smaller, my cat will pour out the water by picking at the bottom and tipping it."
4,Love this fountain!!,"I have had this fountain for a little over six months now, and finally decided to write a review. While it took some time for my cats to get used to the fountain, they now love it. I typically keep it on the lowest setting - mainly because the reservoir runs out too quickly if it is on the highest setting. I only gave it four stars, because it is somewhat cumbersome to clean. But, it is worth my sanity of not having to turn the bathroom sink on for my two cats that like running water. :) Great product!"
5,Wonderful,"Silent. Decently attractive. Lots of water. Nice stream. Captain Janeway, our persian, seems to like it. Our of her bowl, she would use her paws to drink, but this seems to attract her directly to the water, especially the stream. She still cannot figure out how to get her head in there without the water hitting her on top of the head, she seems worried about that which is hilarious! Otherwise, bought it on gold deal and it was definitely worth it."
3,Somewhat divided on this item.,"This is a pretty good idea, but I'm divided on whether I would buy another one. Of our two dogs, one loves to drink from it, the other just ignores it. I got the one dog to drink out of it when I pretended to drink out it myself.The reservoir is plastic and made of two pieces glued together. After 6 months, the two pieces developed a leak along the seam. I contacted the company and they were a real pain about getting it replaced. After several emails they did send a replacement and it's working again.The unit itself is fairly quiet, but does not hold enough water for large dogs. You will likely need to refill it everyday.I also do not like the design because whenever you remove the reservoir to refill it, you knock off the filter cover. Just a flawed design. So far I've replaced the filter once in 6 months, but it's inside. If it were outside I would expect double or triple that.It's a good idea, but it's implementation could be much better."
4,Got a good one,"THe last one leaked all over the floor after a couple of months. Still, I bought another one and this one has been very good. The spoiled rotten cat likes this a lot better than any other fountains we've tried and actually uses it."
3,wet floor,I needed to replace my origional Drinkwell water dish. This new one splashes water on the floor in front of the unit. I never had a problem with the old one getting the floor wet like I do with this one. I had to go out a buy a mat with a lip to put under this water dish to protect my floors. Make sure you plan on buying a water catching mat to go under this unit.
5,Phenomenal product and what a deal!,"In a multi-cat household (11 permanent residents) fresh water is a tough order to fill unless you have a fountain or two. This one is the best design I have ever used (and we have tried them all!) and it holds enough water for several days without needing a refill. The only possible downside is the ""ramp"" the water lands on and the basin the water collects in is symmetrical and therefore does not circulate optimally so stuff (sand. etc) collects in the bottom near the intake. If they had made the landing ""ramp"" slightly curved, it would create a stronger current and there would not be the detritus in the bottom. That said, the thing works great and the cats love it! Will definitely buy again."
4,great product,this fountain is a great product easy to assemble and clean. Our cat loves it and drinks from it all the time!
4,Our old cat loves it,"Our 20 year old cat has started to experience some kidney issues, so she drinks a lot. However, she didn't like water that wasn't fresh, instead preferring to drink from sources other than her water bowl.The Drinkwell seems to keep the water at a freshness level that she likes, because she drinks from it quite happily while she'd turn her nose up at static bowls. I don't know if it's the filter, the aeration of the flowing water, or the fountain breaking the surface tension (or a combination of any of these factors), but she seems quite happy and we don't have to worry about her not drinking enough. It also holds a good amount of water, so we don't have to refill it as often as the old bowls.The only downside is the pump is a little loud. We have it on tile floor in the bathroom and it makes a pronounced hum. Otherwise, an excellent product."
4,Fun for kitties - but required regular cleaning,"I got this because our vet said our cat was not drinking enough water and was not getting enough exercise. I thought of this because she loves drippy faucets. I put it on the 3rd floor of our house so she would have to walk all the way up to play with it. (Her litter and food are on the 1st floor.) The first day, she curled around it and purred loudly. She has not decided that the 3rd floor is her new favorite place to be so I don't see her as much. But I think she is getting more water and exercise.While it solved the two issues for us, I find that it requires cleaning more than I anticipated. (About 2-3x/month). There's a lot of little crevices and nooks to clean out so it's more involved than a quick washing of a water bowl.Other than that, I like this item and our fat cat does, too!"
4,Drinkwell Platinum,"The animals like the moving water and it's fresh and aerated. This is my second one. On the first one, one of the plastic parts on the motor broke when it was not that old and I was unable to buy that 5 cent part on its own. I was told I had to buy the whole motor which was nearly the price of the whole unit. After a lot of searching I was able to buy a metal washer the right size and kind of fix it so it was usable. I hope the second one holds up a little longer. I have a male cat with bladder/urinary issues and I think it's important he has water available that's fresh and attractive to him."
5,Nice fountain but...,"Nice fountain, but... very strange though - their packing QA must be a little bad. For some reason my box included a partially filled package from the Drinkwell Aqua Garden kit. It had the seed basket clip and the instructions, but no seeds or basket. Other than that, it works as advertised. Highly recommended for cats and small dogs - it truly encourages them to drink more."
4,Most cats will like it - in time,"Excellent product. Most of our cats like it (we have three) but one wouldn't have anything to do with it for several weeks. Perhaps she thought it was too big and intimidating. The only negative point is that the electrical cord it too short. Our old fountain, a Petmate, has a cord a full 16 inches longer."
4,Great Capacity but Noisy,I've had a Petmate FreshFlow in the past which didn't work out very well because the pump died several times and my cat figured out how to flip open the top and drag the wet filter all over the house. The Drinkwell fountain keeps the filter far enough away from the water that my cat isn't tempted to rip it open or if she is tempted she hasn't figured out how to open this one's lid. The capacity is incredible! I don't have to worry about it running out and damaging the pump while away on vacation. My only complaint is the noise level. I never heard the Petmate pump unless it was clogged or out of water. I hear the Drinkwell pump all the time and it's loud enough to keep you awake at night. I just hope the pump doesn't die out on me.
5,FANTASTIC!,"I had a kitty that would ONLY drink from the faucet - this lead her to be dehydrated and eventually she developed an infection - poor baby!This is a fabulous fountain. I keep the stream at the lowest level so I can barely hear it; the sound isn't bothersome at all. I never turn on the faucet anymore, and she doesn't ask for it either. Awesome!My advice is to make sure to clean it EVERY WEEK without fail. I actually have it in my phone to remind me. As long as I stay on that schedule, cleaning it is super easy. I did buy the cleaning kit, and I usually just use the two smaller pieces in that kit. When I clean the reservoir I add a drop or two of all natural dish soap with warm water, cover the opening with my hand and shake it. Then I just make sure it's rinsed very very well. It also helps tremendously to ONLY use filtered water; I have yet to see any weird goo.Keep it away from food - this will help a lot as well."
3,Too Loud,"I bought this to replace an aging Fresh Flow mainly because the carbon filters for the Drinkwell are far superior and they offer a much larger reservoir capacity. However, from the moment I plugged this in, the noise from the pump drove me crazy. It's a constant, audible buzzing. If you have this somewhere you're never around it, like a utility room, garage, or basement, it's probably fine. But if you're noise sensitive and live in a smaller space like an apartment, the noise could be bothersome."
5,pet owner,I have a number of cats that liked to drink directly from the sink fawcet. This was not handy when you are trying to use the sink yourself. The drinkwell solved the problem the first day it was put in operation. Whihin a few days all cats were drinking from the drinkwell at their leasure and the sink fawcet was no longer a factor. It is easy to refill and maintain. It does make a slight watefall sound that is noticeable but not annoying. I bought the platinum version and like it although I can't compare it to the standard version since I haven't used it. I recommend this product to anyone with a similar situation or in need of automatic water availability for their pets.
5,Much nicer than original Drinkwell,"This fountain is so much better than the original Drinkwell fountain. Easier to clean, easier to assemble and quieter. Highly recommend."
3,Had potential to be great and falls short,"I have waited a long time to get this album and I'm left feeling somewhat let down. The opening ballad isn't bad but it lacks depth and the rocker following it Aftermath does make up for the bad start. But the crowning point of the album is Power & Glory, probably one of his finest instrumentals ever. If the price was lower I would say buy it just for that track. It's worth it to me for that song alone."
4,Finally,"I love this pillow. I have six toys and they all fit in this pillow. I wanted somewhere to keep my toys clean, and out of sight. Living in a dorm with a close-minded roommate, privacy is limited and there aren't many places for me to keep them from her snooping. This soft little pillow hides them great and people have even laid on the pillow and didn't even know anything was inside. Zipper is a little flimsy, just be gentle with it."
4,Great buy!!!!!,This is very deep on the inside! go for this product i just love it. its very roomy and easy to zip b/c your toy/others go to the bottom and you can't feel them b/c of the padding wich is great! i'd love it more and give it five stars but the zipper is easy to zip but small so like the other review be jental with it! ;)
4,Expect it to be small,"I purchased this pillow our of curiosity. My husband and I are always looking for better ways to hide our sex toys from prying eyes and this seemed to fit the bill. You can comfortably fit three toys in here without noticing much but past that and it gets bulgy. Only one side of the pillow is well padded so make sure that side is ""up"" before placing anywhere someone might see. We use it to hide on our bed so it is not that big of a deal as we just remove them at night.Expect this product to be SMALL. It looks roughly 10x10 or 12x12 which is much smaller than I had imagined. The zipper is a little on the cheap side but is VERY well hidden. It looks like a pillow case cover. The zipper seems like it will be likely to break after repeated use but for the price it is worth it."
3,ok but could be bigger,"I think this pillow should be a little bigger, also i thinkn it is a bit overpriced for its size"
4,decent dictionary,It is a decent dictionary. Particularly useful for those whose native language is EnglishIMHO the price is too high
4,Beats the heck out of the over the door traction device,"So about my only complaint on this item is the smell, which hopefully will disipate over time. I've had mine for two weeks now and it is certainly better than being tethered to the door with the old ""over the door neck traction device"". I always felt kind of trapped in that hang yourself high device, I mean that worked too, but you couldn't do anything but sit there. With this device, I can do almost anything ambulatory. (don't wear it to work unless your coworkers are kinder than mine were). It provides however much traction you want, just pump it up with the squeeze ball (like the blood pressure cuff uses) and let out pressure by turning the thumb screw. Heck I'm wearing it now while I type this review (why I remembered I should leave a review)."
1,not as advertised,"I returned this item because it is not as advertised. The container is actually about 3x2 inches. Although it is pretty, it did not meet my needs."
2,Nice product. Broken in shipping.,"This is a nice product that looks good and feels substantial when you hold it. As others have mentioned, it comes with the cups, which is nice. However, mine came cracked in two places because of the very poor way it was packaged. Shipping it back would be half the price of buying it in the first place. Buy this in a brick-n-mortar store if you can, otherwise you are taking a gamble on Amazon shipping it in one piece."
5,soap dish,it is simple but still elegant and will match any decor. i also purchased the matching toothbrush holder. just love that it is an open styyle so that it is always so easy to keep clean.
5,"InterDesign York Disposable Cup Dispenser, White/Chrome",The cup dispenser was just as described and we like it. It arrived on time and the price was fair.
2,York Apothecary,"The York Apothecary jar listed and shown matches my existing set and I purchased it to replace a broken piece . However, the lid is different from my set and that shown in the photo."
3,Okay,Bought this jar as a cotton ball holder. The bottom of the jar isn't totally flat so it wobbles a bit but it looks okay and serves its purpose.
5,InterDesign York Oval Soap Dish,"This is Perfect! I love the design, made very well and looks great in my bathroom! I ordered another one for the other bathroom! I told some of my friends about these York products!"
3,Need more product info,It would be great if the product description included the cup size that fits this dispenser. Is it 3 oz? 5 oz?
1,poor packaging,"I ordered three of these and they were as expected, but poorly package so one is broken. If properly packaged this would not have happened."
1,Not quite as advertised,"If you are expecting this to actually be a ""Large"" canister - do not. This canister is actually short and much smaller than the other InterDesign sells (within the same set) that is not advertized as large. This canister stands about three inches high, and is surprisingly SMALL."
5,Packaging Great,"I was worried when I placed my order for two dispensers. Other reviews complained of breakage. Amazon must read and act on these reviews. My dispensers were wrapped to twice their size in bubble wrap and the box had padding as well. Good job Amazon! The dispensers themselves are a perfect fit for our bathrooms. Cups are just the right size for bathroom use. The ceramic adds an upscale look, especially compared with the older plastic dispensers. They are attractive and useful, I am very happy with this product."
4,You can really learn french !,"With this french course you will be able to write, read and even to speak the language at an unexpected time. It allow you to learn the french language with very easy lessons. It is divided into lessons, so it allow you to learn even when you do not have to much time to spend on it. I think that this french course cd it is very complete, so it can be usefull for beginners and for those people that already have some knowledge of the french language."
5,Sharp Little Book,"This is an excellent introduction to the history and beliefs of Methodism. For anyone who wants a good introduction to John Wesley and the Methodists, this is it. I've used it to teach new-member classes and have found it to be very helpul!"
5,"Amazon Book, Just About Perfect",The book is exactly what I wanted. It is simple and an easy read while giving insight and history to Methodists. I ordered it online and it was shipped immediately. Thanks....
2,You won't meet anyone!,"As an active Methodist, a devotee of John Wesley, and a reader of many tomes on this denomination, I found this book poor on almost every score. You won't get to know any great Methodists well from this book. You also won't learn much about Methodist doctrine.You will get a watered-down, highly liberal slant on what the United Methodist Church is up to today, with a little skewed history tossed in. If that's what you want, order it. If you want to find out about Wesley, order a biography or his own writings instead. If you want to learn about Methodist Doctrine, read the nice little volume of that title by Campbell."
5,Beatle-esque,"...and why shouldn't it be since it was produced, in part, by George Martin? But the excellent song writing makes it so much more than a Beatle wannabe album.The songs are joyous, humorous, pensive, exhilirating and remarkably well written, produced and performed. I have both the LP and the CD (which has three added tracks, which actually thematically detract from the original LP).I highly recommend the purchase of this fun CD."
5,An old favorite,"My brother had given me the LP years ago stating that he thought it was junk. After one listen I realized that it was anything but. I think that this masterpiece, elegantly produced by George Martin, stands as a tribute to the Fab Four. But I feel that it's more than a tribute album and stands as a wonderful compilation in its own right. The songs range from humor to pathos. Excellent instrumentals and a Fab time."
1,Used Battery sold as new,"I bought this battery as a new battery, but when I received it, it was not in original packaging, and had black marks on it in the exact same location as the ones on my old battery-made by being in the phone! I called to complain and was told they ""frequently take the batteries out of the original packaging to test them"". I will not buy from them again. And would suggest others avoid them as well."
2,Notebook Keyless Cable Lock,It serves it's purpose. Instruction to use this item is very unclear. I will definitely not purchase this item again.
1,Piece of Junk,"This is your basic Chinese knock-off of the Targus Defcon CL laptop security lock which is a fine piece of equipment.Unlike the standard cables, this cable is 3.5 feet shorter. The construction is flimsy and even before taking it out of the cheap packaging you get the feeling that it might fall apart. It actually looks like something you'd see on the shelves of The Dollar Store.With a laptop security cable the deterrence is just the sight of the cable affixed to the laptop. Even bad guys are lazy and if they have a choice between fighting a locked item or stealing an unlocked one, they'll go to the laptop without a cable sticking out of it.One of my fears with this lock is that we might not be able to get it to unlock and then we'd really be in a world of hurt."
2,Not very good for laptops,"I bought this look in the hope that it would help me secure my TOSHIBA laptop. It didn't. Even with the wrong combination, when you press the release button the locking pin retracts ever so slightly, making it possible to remove the lock from the Kensignton slot. I'll have to buy a good Kensington T-bar lock to replace it.It does seem to work properly with the slot in the other end of the chain and the steel cable seems to be good. So I wouldn't advertise it as suitable for PCs, but if you have something else you need to chain down, this should help."
1,these pictures are inaccurate,"I bought 6 of these in a rush, as the first picture clearly shows a Targus laptop lock (or a darn close match).I should have looked at the other 2 pictures... as only the MIDDLE picture is accurate. The last one is a KEY (!!!) lock with a black-plastic covered cable. I'm amazed that this vendor would dare show pictures of 3 completely different locks presumably representing what you are buying. The one you get smells of machine oil and is cheaply built - probably $3.00 in Chinatown. I'm extremely disappointed, as now I need to return them and repurchase good ones."
1,Not what I expected,"Description says the cable is 6 ft long. Not on what I received. One of the locks wouldn't fit the locking slot on the laptop, I worked on that now it fits. I figured the cable and locking mechanisms were worth the $8 and I could make them work. I do wish they would have the 6 ft. cable can't make it longer. Now my real complaint. Shipping costs. The cable is listed as weighing 2 lbs. I received three and the USPS label said the weight for three was 2 lbs. I paid $16.47 for shipping and I would guess that was twice what it actually cost. Wish there was something other than not to buy we could do to make shipping costs realistic. Appears to me what they don't make on the product they make up on shipping and that ever elusive extra called Handeling."
1,unfortunately I can't give this item NO STARS,"unfortunately I fell for the great price. I couldn't even get one quality use out of this. The lock broke when I tried to input my personal code, trapping my computer in the lock! fortunately this device is poorly built and was nothing a pair of pliers couldn't handle. But, it's useless to try and return this because of the ridiculous return policy of not refunding shipping costs. The thing cost 3.99, but shipping was like 6 bucks. So, even if I try to return this for a refund, I'm still out 12 bucks in shipping!!!! NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE. Sorry folks, don't fall for it."
1,Better not to skimp on a security device,"I was attracted by the low price, so I figured this may as well be disposable. It was. It doesn't even fit my HP Pavilion (a very common brand) so I couldn't even begin to test it! But even before that, the lock mechanism and casing seem very flimsy and cheap. I'd bet it could be dismantled with a flathead screwdriver without harm to the computer. The cable and loop seem okay...The picture looks exactly like many others online under various brand names, so just avoid this type. Since this is a security device, I'll shell out for a better-made lock."
2,What you pay is what you get,"Considering the price, I was not expecting to receive a high-quality product. Thus, when I received the item, I was not impressed. Although it's not a perfect fit for my older-model Dell laptop, it does work. However, it does look easily breakable and I do not expect to be much of a deterrent to anyone even slightly determined.However, for my purposes, it works great and I have no complaints as I knew I would get something much like this.I would recommend this product to everyone who wants a cheap deal and is not expecting the best of quality."
1,crappy,okay the packege looks okay but when u open it the targets suck there like reguler notebook papers with crappy little circles on it so u shouldent buy this
3,"didn't get what I ordered. I ordered multiple targets, not just 1 type","The picture you show in cataloge shows several different types of targets in 1 pack. And you sent 1 type of target, real small ones. I'm disabled and can't get to the post office to send them back. So I'll just keep what you sent even though it's not what was ordered."
4,great but Lochloosa is better,"This is funkier as opposed to their other cd which rocks harder.Mofro makes great music and is even better live. They take these 3 minute ditties and extend them into 10 minute killer jams!Blackwater is a throaty, hammond organ Allman brother type slow tune. Ho-Cakes is a funked out jam ode to the joys of southern cooking. Air, Free and FLorida are laid back grooves. Jookhouse a Meters type of jam that works great in concert.As a southerner, I love this band. Topical lyrics, funky danceable grooves and good musicianship define this band.The only reason that I did not give this cd 5 stars is b/c Lachaloosa is better. Otherwise, I give it a thumbs up real high.Catch this band live if you can, they are excellent and will make you appreciate the recorded works ever more"
5,Great live,I saw Mofro when they opened for Medeski Martin and Wood in Madison. They were incredible live so I bought the CD and I listen to it all the time. I recommend the CD but even more than the CD I recommend seeing them live. The CD is a great quality recording but in concert they sounded amazing. Mofro was a very moving show; not many bands can convey emotion so purely or effectively as Mofro did live. I was very impressed.
5,"a day off, remembered for a life time","I was working in a summer camp this past summer, I was on a day off, we went to a great barrington MA, we were ment to goto a 4th july, festival, which we had been told was on (but wasn't), so we get a motel room and hit the town, we end up in a bar called ""Club Helsinki"" so we get in and this band where playing, and they were MOFRO, there soul, blues, funk mixture is perfect for chillin out to, no matter what your tastes there a little there for everyone. Met them outside after the show, and they are really cool guys as well, so when I got back home I picked up a copy of the album to remind me of a great day off.."
3,ok..,"The dye is not as red as I was hoping. My hair is dark brown and I had some blonde streaks from a previous dye. The blonde turned out more of how the dye is supposed to look on dark brown hair and where I died my natural hair, it has a red tint to it and is slightly lighter in the sunlight. If you have dark hair, I would suggest bleaching it first. The color my hair turned out is nice, but not what i was expecting."
2,Ehhh.. Not Really Worth It,"This book is not really worth spending money on. The advice is mostly common sense and some of the nutrition infomation is not exactly accurate. I'm not qualified to comment on the accuracy of the other sections, but you get the idea. If you really feel a burning desire to read this item I suggest you check it out of the library and not waste your money."
2,still a self-help book,"I was expecting a witty take on 20-something women in the new century (similar to the ""Bad Girl's Guide..."" books). While sometimes witty, this book failed to overcome it's strong self-help vibe."
2,"Ver much for the Cosmo crowd, there are better books","This book is very much for the Cosmo mag crowd, I'd suggest getting another book if you do not fit into that category. And if you do fall into the crowd, after you read this one you really should check out better books on this subject with more helpful info (even if it isn't as cute)."
3,Good advice but....,"This is a good book for advice on clothing, how to take care of it, there's money advice, career advice, political and environmental advice. I love those sections of the books, however there is some foul language in the book and I disagree with the authors version of what she considers to be spiritual.For the author having a spiritual life considers of medatating and yoga, so I didn't get much out of those chapters. There are some chapters in which she discusses dating, sex, and masturbating. I don't agree with such chapters, they were filthy.Most of the advice is repeated, meaning its general and you can read it in other books."
1,Nothing here....,This book is quite light on content...not a lot of anything except admonitions to make your 20's your best years...WHAT?!?! I did not realize it was aimed at 19 year olds. It is. Anyone older than 19 already knows everything in this book -- and a whole lot more. Waste ot money.
1,Highly Disappointing,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I picked up this book at the library, but whatever it was, I didn't find it in this book.There were more than a few times when i just flipped through the pages, hoping that the book would get better, it didn't.Although Anna mentions buying things on a budget, I think her idea of what is budget priced is way out of reach of most women I know.The sections on organization and nutrition are also a bit off.Don't waste your time reading this book. Buy a fashion magazine instead."
4,Charming and upbeat,"The author tries to cover many areas in women's lives, and admits that she is no expert of all of them. Nevertheless, I think the result is very good. She has consulted people who know more than she doew about some subjects, and no one should be expected to be an expert about everything. Such an author would lack credibility. Instead, Anna Johnson manages to write like a somewhat older friend - she has been there and done that.The book is not only filled with interesting tips and tactics, but also makes you feel better about yourself and your life when reading it. I would also like to especially recommend the bibliography in the end - lots of good booktips!"
3,"It's okay, but seems a little outdated.","Overall, this seems like an alright book. As a young woman who recently entered the working world, some of this advice seems slightly outdated too me; almost frumpy. Other reviewers have mentioned this is more of a non-cosmo-crowd book, and I would agree. It does have some sound advice re: trying to diet and exercise, but some of the suggestions re: clothing styles, etc. are just soo old fashioned for me."
4,Wonderful for twenty-somethings but ...,"This is a gem of a book, chock full of helpful information, great basics and sane advice. Just the fact it doesn't encourage women to be always-perfect superwomen is refreshing! (That third black skirt is for slobbing out.) It addresses everything from fixing faucets and handling finances to maintaining friendships, decorating your space and dating. This book is perfect for a college grad or any young woman just starting out, and for that readership, I highly recommend it.That said, however, I don't think this book has a lot to tell anyone over thirty or who is married with kids. In fact, the section on juggling work and family (the author freely admits she has no children and so consulted several friends on the topic) is lame at best.It's a fun read, her insights are good, and her writing is sharp and witty. As a starting out book, it's great. For the rest of us (I'm 35), there may be a gem or two, but I wouldn't look for any new wisdom here."
1,Fluff,"Cute title, sassy graphics, but this is just run-of-the-mill advice about how to live well (e.g., exercise)."
3,Like a Tune-up for Your Life!,"Granted, this book is far from being a literary masterpiece. The author's advice is hardly earth-shattering. But you know what? It hits the spot for me everytime. Nobody is perfect and everyone has room for improvement in their life. We all need a good dose of common sense every once in awhile! This book always lifts my spirits. It makes me realize what part(s) of my life I have been neglecting and the little things I can do to get back on track. It motivates me. It's like a tune-up for me. I read it once a year or so. All the information is pretty superficial, but it's enough. Who has time to read details on cooking a 5 course meal AND being chic AND installing shelves in your house, etc.. If you want details on something, get it elsewhere. This is a good all-around guide though."
3,A light funny read!,"I finished reading this book in one sitting. It is a light, funny read. The material on finances is very basic. I wanted to read more about clothes and beauty."
3,Not the best of its kind,"I didn't like this book all that much for a few reasons: first, sporadically throughout it she makes remarks that make you feel like she's telling you it's not okay to be eccentric (which, by the way, I am). Second, her fashion and beauty advice is really only for preppy types (which I'm not). Third, there was definitely not enough information in the sections about your soul and spirit (which is the main reason I read it). So, my advice is to read it only if you are not the least bit eccentric (i.e. boring), are a preppy person, and don't want advice and information about your soul and spirit."
2,Not worth it,"This book barely skims the surface! One could get more info from a fashion magazine. The author discusses many topics, but does not give any detailed advice. The subject matter of the book is too broad to be of any use. I finished the book in 2 sittings. You probably already know the information inside this book."
3,great for women in school or recent grads...,"but not for anyone over 25. The writing was clever and fun, but this information is really for younger women.I'm in my late twenties and found the information to be things I've already learned (i.e. invest in your company 401K; treat a job seach like a career). I found this to be a little information (or even common sence!) about a lot of topics. I'm far from a know it all- but I really didn't learn anything from this book and was dissapointed.However- this would make a PERFECT HS/college graduation gift, or may be really helpful for women starting out."
3,Not too impressed,I'm halfway through this book and I'm not too impressed. A lot of it is common sense I already knew. The parts that I am impressed on are the very risque chapters!!! ;D I'd still buy this book again....but used.
2,Not for anyone over the age of 25!,"I honestly thought this book was about fashion, but it really isn't. Most of the book was completely useless to me. That's not to say that it doesn't contain useful information or that it is poorly written, it's just that I'm in my early 30's and I already know this stuff. This book is great for a girl who has just graduated from college or is living by herself for the first time. Definitely something for the younger, less experienced ladies!"
2,Try the demo before buying!,"It is good that Eidos Interactive launched a demo so that everybody, who can download the 312 MB, can try it. The demo is regrettably limited to only 2 missions and no multiplayer function. It shows, however, that the game has very nice graphics, but overall it does not bring anything new or better than other Command and Conquer-style games. You are in command of a tank or a squadron, plus the support of soldiers and bombers. You control them with a mouse clicks and that's it (for me). I did not like it and also I think that the too limited demo version deters customers. I'm glad I saved few bucks."
5,this was fresh,I loved it. it was off the hook i can finally listen to the organial SHOW by Rick the Ruler and Doug e fresh
4,La Biblia Latinoamerica: Letra Grande,Esta Biblia de edición Católica es muy buena y tiene excelentes comentarios.Tiene pasta dura y las letras en su mayoria son grandes y te ayudan a leer con mas comodidad. Las hojas son un poco delicadas pero te permiten marcarlas si eres de los que les gusta destacar al leer.
1,La Biblia Latinoamericana,"The only good thing about this bible it that have big letters, so it easier for the older to read. The wording it is really bad, The translation in Spanish it is very different from all others bibles, it is a poor translation. I bought it a long time ago, and I was very dissapointed when I started reading it. I stop using it and bought the New American bible and I am very happy with the translation, easy to understand and accurated."
2,La Biblia: Letra Grande (spanish edition) (hardcover),I was very dissapointed when I received the bible. It has no separators and I have had to make an additional purchase for them. It would be nice to have that added on the bible description.
1,late delivery,"I haven't got my bible yet. They claim that it is because Xmas, but nothing justify one month delay. How long should I wait?"
1,didn't last,"Lasted only 2 weeks. Week 1- speed one went out, week 2 it died. Worked good for week. Buy at you own risk."
4,Good Golly!,"If you're looking for strong clit stimulation, you'll find it with the Pocket Rocket Plus! I was skeptical at first, but once I started using it, I was hooked. It's a little louder than I would have preferred (which is why I only give it four stars), and it tends to get kind-of hot when used for an extended time (>30 minutes). Despite those few minor complaints, I think this was a good buy, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone else!"
3,WELL????,GOOD PRICE FOR A TOY W/ SO MUCH ENERGY....BUT ONLY CONDUCIVE TO THOSE THAT DO NOT NEED INTERNAL STIMULATION....
4,AMC White Mountain Guide,This is a really nice trail guide. You will find all informations about trails in the White Mountains. Three maps are included. The only negative point is that there is no photos in this book. Photos are very important for me.
1,Butterfly Fairy Environmental Danger,"While the sculpture is attractive, it contains lead of unknown quantity. Upon opening, it is noted that a tag is attached advising that the sculpture contains lead and hands must be washed after handling."
3,Where do these people come from?,"As the author of this slim book I should probably respond to the annoying review by Kuhn. First of all, the book's length was established by the British Museum Press -- I had nothing to do with this decision. ""Maya Glyphs"" forms part of a series, all of which are volumes of equal length. Second, the manuscript was prepared in 1988. Obviously I would not write precisely the same book today. The Press has never allowed me to revise the book, and it certainly needs to be replaced. Mike Coe will soon publish, with Mark Van Stone, an introductory volume that should please and instruct readers. Most other books on Maya glyphs cannot be recommended at this time."
4,More should have been better,"A very concise description of maya writing. Really useful for beginners trying to understand the mechanics of the mayan writing system. But in some sense it lacks some deepness. It stays on the surface, even though its author is one of the big names on mayan epigraphy."
2,Not much value here,"Sadly, I can find very little to recommend this book for. Consisting of barely 80 pages, it starts with a short introduction of the nature of Maya writing and its decipherment, both of which you will find in more comprehensive and understandable form in Michael Coe's ""Breaking the Maya Code"". It then switches very fast to some rather specialist examples completely unsuited for the beginner. In the end, you get 1 (read:one) sample text, and that's about it. On the positive side, which is as thin as the book itself, Houston mentions some interesting details, like the stylistic variations among glyphs of different regions, which are rarely found in other volumes, but these tidbits of valuable information hardly constitute a reason to purchase this book. One for completists only."
4,Expansion rod,"I bought this, thinking that it was a 72"" rod that would be screwed to the wall. It fit, but it's just a long expansion rod with screw mountings. There is still a change in diameter at the expansion. There is a plastic insert that keeps the rings moving fairly smoothly over the jump, so we didn't return it."
4,Very nice introduction about the Titanic,"Interesting and informative. Very good overall introduction for anyone who's a newcomer on this subject. The narrators do a very good job. They speak very clearly, and their voices are very nice. There's a little mistake, though. When the narrator mentions the names of people, some of the pictures do not match the names - but only a couple of them. I still think it's not a problem. When a friend of mine asked me about the Titanic, I simply lend him this video. He likes it too."
1,A flawed variant of mathematical statistics,"The variance of the distance-weighted average was lost on Agterberg's watch in 1970 and 1974. The variance of a set of functionally dependent distance-weighted averages is invalid. That's all,"
1,Dumbest is correct,"For the price I did not believe I could be disappointed,Wrong !!!Even with repeating the same scenes over three or four times,and adding a Quiz?,this dvd fell short of it 105 minuterunning time. This is the only positive I found in {USA'S DUMBEST CROOKS}.I found little if any humor. Using poor quality surveillancetapes on most of the dvd & the repetition of such was less then enjoyable"
1,Dumb criminals? DUMB VIDEO!,I thought this would be entertaining and provide a little laughter. It provided a lot of eye rolling and thoughts of how stupid and cheesy the whole video is. Save your money.
5,A Great Historical Study for Progressive Catholics,"This book gives a thorough yet reader-friendly history of the struggles that Rome has had with the modern liberal world. Burns examines--in depth--the conflicts between Rome and American bishops as well as the role that the American laity has played throughout it all. Burns also addresses the Church in modern Latin America, and concludes with his views on the future of the Church for liberals and progressives. This is a necessary book for anyone wanting to understand the history behind the current schism between conservative and progressive American Catholics."
3,"Promising start, looses steam by the end.",Was really excited to watch this anime because of the talent involved. It ended up being a bit of a disappointment.
3,Leaving a little to be desired,"Was very very slow starting out, I have a short attention span for movies so this was rough for me. It was slow to the climax, took half the movie to get there. Then it was a short ending, lacking the bells and whistles. Ok to watch, but I suggest barrowing it, not buying it."
5,Chaos head is amazing,This is an amazing series I recommend it to anyone who likes violence. The characters are all good with their voices.
3,Move way too fast and ruins its creepy atmosphere.,"Chaos;Head is 13 episodes long and sold for 70 bucks when first put on the market. What a ripoff and no I have not bought this series but I have seen it on Funimation on Demand. The story demands it should have been at least 26 to 52 episodes long. The reasons include an antagonist the LITERILY pops out of NOWHERE, under-developed concepts and characters, a rather large cast of main/importent characters of at least 15, and a nice, creepy atmoshere ruined within two or three episodes. It is not a terrible series but if it just a strait up horror series rather than not turning it into an action series during the last four or five episodes it would have been alot better. If you were looking for a good anime horror series look else where like Shiki. It seems that it wanted to be longer but due to a (perhaps) low budget it had to be too short to be great."
2,Disappointing,"If you are like me, you have stumbled across Chaos;Head due to the anime Steins;Gate, both having been created by 5pb. and Nitroplus. However, Chaos;Head does not measure up to Steins;Gate in any sort of positive way. In a nutshell, Chaos;Head is plagued by: inconsistent animation that varies from mediocre to garbage; a cast of ridiculously unlikable characters that you will be cheering to get the axe; and an overly ambitious plot that eventually devolves into what feels like fan-fiction. It is hard to believe that this load of tripe came from the same studio that gave us Steins;Gate. However, I recommend you save your money and wait for the eventual release of S;G on Blu-ray...I know I wish I had done the same!"
2,"Poor story, good animation, sort of cool premise.","The animation and music are very good. Some attempt is made to make deeper characters. However, the story and plotting is poor. It copies elements from other animes, like bleach (the D-sword). It was a neat idea to make the main character a hardcore otaku, but it doesn't culminate into something more for him. In short this anime lacks meaning and narrative. It goes off on its own tangents, and sometimes it goes nowhere. There isn't much reason to watch this. Its mostly a generic crap anime. It would have made a better video game than an anime. If you are looking to spend money on anime there are other places you should put it."
2,Lame,"If you're into animes with lots of action, then this one is not for you. The first disc of this series focus more on, science mystery. The show only starts to develop with action when you watch the second disc.I hate how the main male character is always so sadly down and depressed. This show is way too confusing, talks about a boy who should of never existed in that world, he was really that old man in the wheel chair."
2,Why?,"""From the mind that brought you Death Note comes a schizophrenic anime [left out for literal reasons] that will make you doubt everything you think you're seeing.""Yeah its THAT BAD. This monstrosity Amazon.com calls an anime is the least bit stimulating, for many reasons, such as its unlikable cast, plot, and art-style that makes me want to find my original copy of the game and cling onto it for dear life. Chaos;Head was much better as a game. The game itself is average because the storyline is just so overexposed. If you are new to anime, I recommend it if you haven't a thing better to do. If you plan on watching Steins;Gate, well good luck. I don't care if you find my review helpful or not, its MY opinion not yours."
3,"Sweet, enjoyable.....good.for teenagers","This is a delightful, cute book with charm but I don't think a majority of adult readers would enjoy its simplicity. I certainly didn't like the fact that the hero, who is wonderfulin every way, spends the book under an umbrella of his 'stupidity.'But it did enable him to teach in a way that helped all children learn and love learning...."
2,not one of Ms heath best,Dont waste money & buy this book definetly not a keeper unlike her other books such as Texas glory & texas Destiny.
3,yup it works.,Not sure it's worth $30 I paid though. If you have access to a lathe you could make yourself a set in about 20 minutes. Does make the job easier and would recommend to anyone who is changing their impeller just to keep everything aligned to avoid damaging your new parts during assembly.
2,An Unsexy Hero,"I think I would have liked this one a lot more had it not been for one distracting detail: the hero, fresh out of a monastery, spends a good chunk of the story with a tonsure. Talk about a mood killer. I just couldn't get over it, and I can't understand why the author kept bringing it up. Bald spots are just so not cool. The story, itself, was fairly entertaining, so I may check out some more of Leigh's work, provided there are no monasteries."
5,U.S. Latino Literature Today is a great choice,"for any professor of the subject. There are a lot of contemporary writers and some of the ""classics."" Dr. Ventura did a great job with this anthology."
4,good strings,nothing amazing but they sound good and hold up for a fair amount of timeVERY worth the price
2,Sound is too bright and shallow,I put those on Taylor 614CE and they sound aweful compared to Elixirs I had on it before that. Sound is way too bright and shallow - there is no depth I've grown to love to hear from my Taylor. Not buying those again.
2,The Mastery of Submission : Inventions of Masochism,"If you are looking for an upper division college text style book on BDSM you just found one. The book is most certainly not designed for the causal reader. Its dry reading, and has a habit of taking making any point. In general it is much more fun to read the quotes they used rather then the whole book. For the college student researching BDSM this book might be more helpful. To the people in the scene just avoid this book, there really isn't much in it that you can't find elsewhere and in a better format."
2,Not sure....,"Tried a cycle of this, not sure it had any effect at all. Was stacking Fightlabs products with it, but didnt notice anything from this product? I didnt grow a foot taller or gain 50 lbs I guess! Not buying again..."
2,These were o.k.,"I'm not so sure I liked these Dawn Wash & Toss Pads. The soft side fell apart quite easily and to me, they didn't stay soapy long enough to do a sink full of dishes. I think these would be alright for single people or those with only 2-3 family members (total) in the household. But for couples who have more than 1 child, the old-fashioned bottle of dish soap and washcloth work a lot better."
5,at last!,A pair of goggles i can wear while i operate that doesn't look like some geek lab goggles!Cant say how much i enjoy em.Even bought myself a second pair as backup.
2,garbage,"Cheaply priced for a reason, they're garbage. The kind of thing you get for free when you buy a tape measure."
2,Obviously an early work,"I've read a number of books by this author and this seems to be one of her early works, republished now due to her growing popularity. It's not a bad book, just not as developed as later efforts."
2,Not a typical Lisa Jackson book,"I was surprised when I opened the package and saw the length of this book. The description sounded good and I had anticipated a longer story. I am a big fan of her books so I wanted to add this to my collection. This is an earlier work from her and typical of a Harlequin Romance story, which doesn't make it a bad story, just not what I expected. I wish I would have read reviews of the story and not just the description of the book. If you are looking for a great thriller from Lisa Jackson-this is not one of them by any means."
4,Nice and reassuring.,It's nice to have a book like this out. Just what I need when I look around at my messy house when my baby is nursing in lap.
4,Humpty Dumpty!,"Perfect for its purpose... perfect... EXCEPT I decided to really clean it. The lids are connected and lifted right off, making it MUCH easier to wash. Sadly, after 45 minutes, I gave up on trying to get the lids back on, and took the product to the nearest RiteAid. They, too, gave up. The customer service rep online for RiteAid could only suggest getting an exchange. So, if you buy this handy product, and need to wash it, you will wash and dry each of the twenty eight compartments and lids individually. And if you lift the lids off, you will buy a new one!"
1,i'm not sure if this is a fake,"Maybe I'm paranoid about fakes from China, but this pen seems to lack top quality characteristics. I have another Cross Century II Selectip, which I did buy in China strangely enough, that feels better than this one I ordered off of the Amazon.com seller.The cap wobbles very very slightly when on the pen, and the transition from lacquer to steel at the bottom of the pen feels cheap since it transitions through plastic first. Also, when I unscrew the barrel to change out a tip it squeaks and feels of low quality, I don't know why.It writes fine of course. I may end up liking it more as I use it but right now it just feels cheaper than this other Cross Selectip I bought."
2,worst of the ex-military gay autobio's,"Though the back cover shows Zuniga being comforted by Reverend Jesse Jackson, in the text, Zuniga proves himself to be an unrepentant conservative. He got upset when another gay military activist told him to stay out of the limelight, but he lied to the press just to prove a point that he didn't really have the standing to make. He never explains whether he is in a love triangle or what some people refer to as ""a V."" He was a journalism major, so one wonders if he outed himself just to be able to write this book. In all fairness, those readers from conservative backgrounds and in the services may related to him."
3,Update on this camera,"Ok, I took this camera to Key West and Mexico and found that the quality of my photos were ""OK"" meaning they weren't exceptional like my old Nikon Zoom Touch. The pictures weren't as clear as Nikon quality is. Even though I had used the HD Kodak film. I'm still on my regular role of Kodak 400 film, so I will update again. Usually with high end cameras you get high quality photos and crisp pictures but not with Kodak HD film in this camera. The pictures were grainy and not sharp quality, but... it might be the film I used on my trip so you'll have to wait for and update."
4,Great camera but had mechanical problems,"I was really happy with this camera when I bought it. Pictures are great and it is super easy to use. However, after taking about 15 rolls of film or so it started to have a problem with rewinding the film prematurely. Out of about 30 rolls of film, it rewound prematurely 3 times- twice on frame 2 and once on frame 9. Had to get it replaced. Still a very good camera as long as you don't get one with any problems like mine."
4,Great Shots!,"As I have always trusted Nikon. This is the best camera that I have owned since my other Nikon Zoom Touch 400 got to big to carry around. I hated to give up my old camera but this one was the smallest and less bukier camera that I have. I even had to hunt down a Nikon case for it, since no one on the web had the right case for this model. I also searched for the remote that was optional and it wasn't cheap ($25) so I said, ""don't really need it"". I am a litte concerned about the way cameras are being designed, I don't like the sliding cover as you know things wear out in time. So I am keeping my old camera for back up. Because the sliding cover shuts it on/off, what happens when it wears out. It's hard to find a dependable camera out there with the features and quality that are supposed to be in the camera. I love Nikon but I think the quality of camera is being ignored."
5,A Must-Read for every American 20-Something,"Wow. As a 25 year old professional female, I have been astonished to hear socialistic rhetoric coming from college students who have crossed my path in recent months. This book educated, informed, and alerted me to the patterns of thought found in the Communist agenda throughout history. I am weary of the idealistic drivel coming from mostly unemployed post-adolescents who take their U.S. freedom for granted. I am sick of the radical feminist and homosexual agendas and their demands for special treatment. I am tired of being labeled an extremist because I love my country. This book is intelligent, witty, and informative. I think every American should read it."
1,"This book is a fruit cake special, nuts and all.","Much about of this book reminds me of the rantings of the 1960s John Birch Society. They then regarded the entire world as Red or Pinko excepting (white) Union of South Africa, Taiwan, South Korea and the USA, even as they kept warning about the USA. The Viet Nam war was an application of John Bircher foreign policy thinking, exepting for our failure to use nuclear terrorism."
5,Tears the compassion mask off socialism.,"This book tears the compassion mask off socialism. Vazsonyi explains the roots of the only two feasible political schools of thought: socialist and free enterprise, and why they can only be in conflict. It would be helpful if more people realized just one small point discussed in the book: NAZI is the German acronym for the National Socialist German Workers' party. Socialism, according to Marx, Lenin, and all good commies, is the path to the utopia of communism. The NAZIs and the communists are just two sides of the same totalitarian coin. Vazsonyi also explains why socialism is unalterably incompatible with freedom."
2,Vazsonyi is just like his enemies,"Mr. Vazsonyi is an extremely charming man as anyone who saw him on Booknotes will recognize. His book is interesting and provocative. The main thesis is that the Nazis and the Communists were essentially the same because they divided people into two groups: the aryans or the proletariat vs. the racial or class enemy. Unfortunately, Mr. Vazsonyi does exactly the same thing. If you agree with him you are true to America's founding principles. If you disagree on current policies or see a more active role for government then you are really a socialist and all socialists are commmunists. This is ridiculous! I don't assume that someone who opposes affirmative action or environmental regulation secretly wants to restore absolute monarchy."
3,Great! If you don't want to think for yourself.,"This book is very hard to get through. There is a lot of great information but I tend to dislike books where the author can not keep their personal opinion out of it. Page after page the author puts in their input. One of the wonderful things about reading is that the person reading can come to their own conclusion. This book comes across like television....allows for very little of your own interpretation. Also, I find that if your a Christian you may be easily offended by what comes across as attacks on (any) type of religion. When this book came I was so excited to read it but found after a short time it was very preachy. Some may really like this book. It had great potential because the content in general is extremely interesting."
3,Not much bang for the buck,"I didn't think this book was nearly as good as Pardes's earlier ""Countertraditions"". Probably the best part of this book is the way the author points out partially suppressed traditions in the text that go against the ""official line"".Otherwise, the book is pretty weak. Neither the thesis of a national biography nor that of the interplay between national and personal biographies are really fleshed out. The book reads more like a series of observations, with the implications left unexplored."
4,Uh-oh! Great fun!,"This book will make you smile no matter what language you read it in (this book is also available in Spanish). Judy Snider tells the heartwarming tale of a little cat that mothers socks...so much so it gets a little crazy. Children, especially cat lovers and those who have been around momma cats, will delight in the way this story progresses until Goldy finally has real babies of her own. You'll be on the edge of your seat and laughing as the tension builds until at last there is a peaceful, happy ending and all is well again. I loved the watercolor illustrations; the author and illustrator make a great team bringing this story to life and fleshing it out so well. Will there ever be more stories with Goldy? I hope so! - Biblio Reads Children's Book Review"
2,Stay clear of the practices in this one...,"This book has great suggestions on how to prepare for the DAT, and it can help you increase your self-discipline if you decide to not go with at standard DAT preparation course. It doesn't, however, have any summaries of important facts for the science section. The PAT section of the practice test they give you is shortened and it has several wrong answers. You can go ahead and buy it if it makes you feel any more secure about your approaching test, but I wouldn't recommend it."
3,mish mash,"After reading these great reviews on Green Empire I decided to purchase the book and develop an understanding of the St Joe history. While the authors have an incredible amount of history and facts ammassed there did not seem to be a flow to the ""story"". Several instances of jumping around back and forth with facts made this more of a school book than an enjoyable read. Should you want facts this is great, a book to curl up with...no."
4,These weren't the Vegans I was hoping for,"Assorted Vegans! For only $35? What a deal! I was quite looking forward to receiving my Assorted Box of Vegans, but when it arrived, I was woefully disappointed to find a box full of cookies. I was really hoping for a diverse group of Vegans with whom I could converse, and learn more about the Vegan lifestyle. You see, I tend to view Vegans pretty negatively--I can't stand their jeremiads about unethical treatment of animals, long-winded explanations about why honey is the product of animal abuse, and why pleather shoes are a legitimate fashion choice. I really wanted to get my assorted Vegans settled around a crackling fire so we could explore their philosophy and mine, and see if we couldn't reach some truce with each other. Sadly, this was not meant to be, and I was left with a poor substitute for authentic, chock-full-o-butter and eggs cookies."
1,Totally misleading,"Despite the product labeling, there is no mention in the ingredients list of these cookies containing any vegans at all. The claim that they are 100% vegan is therefore false advertising.You will be hearing from my lawyer."
4,nearly unknown but better than a lot of top 50 rock bands,"I bought this CD by chance...and it's really breathtaking !My best buy since a long time...those who like ""snow Patrol"" should appreciate too.The three best songs of the album from my viewpoint:- Do you read me?- Blow- Sea-Side Friends"
4,Purple to Pink.,"I have used this color along with Special Effects Fish Bowl, both work lovely. On my bleached hair it does fade to hot pink after a month or so, but on my niece's mousy brown it turns a darkish pink that looks really good as well. I am pretty pleased with this dye brand and will keep using it."
1,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? AND HE HAS A MBA ?!!!,"My goodness, where do I begin...TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS AND A TON OF NONSENSE about life on ""the Street"". I spent 5 years on Wall Street in various areas of the industry at 2 of the top 5 firms and another one of the top 10 firms. I bought the book because I thought it might give me a basic overview of other areas I might be able to move into and plan a stategy to do. Geez, I was awestruck at the amount of poor writing and overinflated depictions of life in I-Banking. Spare me! I was shocked that the authors made it out of high school much less college and prestigious business program. (I should apply to the school and tell them you can't tell me ""no"" because you said ""yes"" to this guy, and look how he writes and openly acknowledges he's an alumni member.) Spend your money elsewhere. Find folks in the business. You will fare much better. This should get negative stars for a poor attempt at a marketing/advertising book attempting to be substantive."
1,Great service... lousy battery,"The service was quick and reasonably priced. The battery lasted 26 days before an ""invalid battery"" error."
3,I loved it.,I loved this ring when I received it but shortly after I lost a stone in it. It is also a bit uncomfortable to wear.
1,Save your money,"I and a friend are both ship modelers and we both ordered this book. The illustrations are faded and incomplete. My best description is that it looks like the copier ran out of toner before the printing got done. This is consistent throughout the book. I wrote to the publisher via snail mail complaining about the condition of these ""new, reproductions"" and have never received a reply. I am very disappointed with this book and will never buy anything published by Kessinger again."
1,Amazon refunded my money,"The version of this book that I received from Amazon was poorly reproduced and many of the pages were so faded through poor republication techniques and poor quality control as to be unreadable and unusable. I returned the book to Amazon and received a refund. A much better bet is to buy a used copy if you can get the Dial version, which is exquisite. Otherwise save your time and money."
5,Excellent Overview of Brazilian Classical Guitar !!!,"this mostly excellent 2CD sampler released by Kaurup in 2005 is a highly interesting & educational overview of the Brazilian classical guitar [violao] !!! giving the listener exposure to a wide variety of contemporary artists, composers & interpreters of modern classical guitar in Brazil- it is a wonder-full listening experience for any afficianado of the Brazil's contemporary classical guitarists... Kaurup's previous ""stellar"" sampler CDs have provided me with some of the best overviews of the violao & bandolim- & now have done the same with classical guitar in Brazil... another well-produced treasure from a recording company that consistently provides taste-full Brazilian music !!!"
5,Fantastic little versatile case,"Fantastic case made of neoprene (or like) material with foamed rubber sides for added flexibility. Ring makes it easy to operate the velcrowed lid. Somewhat paddedInside you'll find not only the main compartment designed for an iPod as well as other MP3 players, cell phones, digital cameras and PDAs but there's also a separate pocket suitable for an extra memory card or similar storage.Last but not least, on the back there's a belt loop (velcrowed so you don't have to take your belt on and off to wear the case) and also a Karabiner.Inside dimensions are 2-3/8""x5/8""x4-1/8""."
1,dissapointed,"i bought this from a Harris Teeter's grocery store because I love Earl Gray and lavander and tea for that matter. The smell from the box is exquisite, but the taste of the tea is bland and dissapointing. It could have been any no-name brand for all the taste in it. My office mate felt basically the same.I was really looking forward to a wonderful cup of tea. :-("
2,Not as good as past SI swimsuit videos.,Why did they stop the regular videos with the supermodels. Does everyone have to get into the reality show rut?
2,A man of no importance song book.,A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE was listed as a book so I was quite surprised when it showed up as a songbook. There were other songbooks listed which is why I chose this one as I was interested in buying the script. So I was unhappy about that. I enjoy the music and I imagine if I read music this would have been a perfect choice for me. So buyer beware.
3,OLD SCHOOL FA REAL FA REAL!!!,"YEP THIS IS THAMAN SPEAKING, THANKS TO A CAT I KNEW FROM 94,PUT ME ON TO IT,BACK WHEN WE WAS MAKING MIXTAPES...P.O.W YEAH!!NUFF RESPECT,BUT TO PROCEED ON I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET THIS ALBUM,TO ME IT'S ONE HELL OF A DEAL...I LIKE OLD SCHOOL, IT WILL NEVER DIE,TO END THIS... MAY BE NOT A CLASSIC TO SOME,AS FOR ME I HAVE IT...AND IT'S A WRAP!!!"
1,Doesn't fit my KRZR,I bought this for my KRZR and it doesn't fit. It's too tight and feels like I'd break it or my phone if I try to foce it on. The hole for the phone-charger is on the WRONG SIDE! I'm very displeased.
3,Okay,Product is okay. Shelf is a little bit long to fit in average rack space. They didn't include any screws which was a big letdown. I have none laying around that size so I had to run across town to find some.
4,Just OK but for $20 I didn't expect that much more,This 1u shelf is not what is pictured here. The 1u has no front lip (which i like to keep my gear all lined up) and the rack ears were bent. I would have rated this shelf 3 stars if price wasn't a factor. I guess you get what you pay for so I can't complain too much. It does get the job done at holding my DirecTV H24-100 box. Don't expect Porsche quality for VW prices. If you understand this you will be happy with your purchase.
5,Sturdy shelf,"Shelf is solidly build, I use it to hold a router and access point. Does the job just fine no complaints from me."
4,"Informative, entertaining, and enjoyable","I don't purchase many DVDs as I soon get tired of them. Not this one. When I tire of TV I watch Toby Keith's biography, or his movies over and over. The biography does a good job of covering his life from beginning to the present. I would have liked more personal interviews of him. Too bad we don't see more of him on TV. We need more patriotic citizens like Toby Keith. He stands up for what, and whom, he thinks is best for our country, not for the party."
2,Toby Keith Biography (2008),"I feel that listing this as Toby Keith Biography (2008) is very misleading. The dvd was created in 2005 and was aired on television. I was under the impression that this was a new dvd being released in relation with Beer for My Horses and his That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy cd. I was disappointed when I put the dvd in to watch it and it was something I had already seen.I love Toby and it is an informative dvd, it just isn't a new release as implied."
2,pics sometimes don't tell the whole story,quality is in line with the low price of the faucet. i am placing this in an old craftsman house i am reclaiming and since i am selling the house as soon as i finish rehabbing it at least the faucet will look new and better than the existing one.
2,doesn't work right,"The plumber put the faucet in and the handle on the left does not stay stationary. Once you turn on the hot water, the handle will automatically keep turning until it cannot turn anymore. I will be returning it."
2,u get what u pay for,"The handles are hard to turn and the spout is a little bent, but it delivers water at a price that can't be beat. You get what you pay for..."
3,TO SHORT,"Didn't know it was going to be only 6"" I needed a longer faucet at least 9"" would have been better but the Idem was still well made thank you"
5,"Funny, Truthful, Refreshing - Not Politically Correct!!!","LOVE THIS BOOK! Great Job! It's hilarious, truthful, - definately not politically correct - how refreshing!"
3,Wow!!!,"The initial shipment from this company was wrong. I returned the item and had to contact the company two weeks later to find out the status of my order. The company's representative told me that they had not received my returned order, but that once they received it they would process my order. Miraculously, my order shipped the very next day. Upon receipt of my order, the second time, I found that the CD had some sort of goo or adhesive on it. After cleaning the goo off, I was amazed that it actually played."
3,Purchased for Charity,"I purchased this item online to be sent to an ""Angel Tree"" type request. I did not actually receive the item, don't know if it was received, or if it is liked. I hope all the above is in the affirmative. However, the purchase process, the communication concerning the purchase and shipment was most excellent. Unless I hear future complaints that those girls are not receiving their gifts, I would not hesitate to repeat this process next gift-giving season."
3,so-so product,My 7 yo daughter wanted this toy for her birthday and has hardly played with it. Too many pieces and complicated instructions for her. She said it was not what she expected after watching the commercials. I thought it looked like fun and need to try working with her more on it...if I can find all the pieces again!
2,Good for beginners,"I'm a seasoned ex-elite racer. I bought this book with great enthusiasm, but found it to be oriented to the novice rider. It didn't add as much as I though it would, in fact, after my 10+ year career, it didn't add anything!There are better books for bicycle racing out there: Eddie B.'s Bicycle Road Racing is my favorite, even if it's 20 years old.This book tells about training, bicycle equipment and very little about racing itself."
5,Everything you need to know about candy,This is the book I use for making candy. Every recipe works. I am looking for another copy to give to my kids.
1,unmemorable,This song is slow and boring without having enough of a hook to grab you. I'd recommend Deep River over this song any day.
4,Progpower!,This is an excellent album. The singer combines a somewhat rawer singingstyle with a pure voice. My cup of tea!
2,Love the Front; Back is $*@%,"The front of this is great! Vibrant colors, wonderful design. But the back is peeling off like cheap nail polish."
3,Rewind!!!!....,"This is a John Waters film. I think that pretty much says everything. You hear that, you know your not gonna get a normal, sane movie. This oddball film is no exception. Kathleen Turner delivers a knockout performance as a suburban housewife with a great husband and family(Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew ""Scream"" Lillard). But, this happy homemaker is no Mrs. Brady. Dear old mom is a murdering psychopath!!. You wear white after Labor Day, your in big trouble. The movie is twisted and hilariously demented. Did you expect anything less from John Waters?. The jokes are offensive and many gags are not for the squeamish. Obviously, Waters' movies are not for everybody. This one, while it might appear to be otherwise, is not for everyone. Not by a long shot. Many scenes I exploded in laughter. I think you will too. If not, then you get a great performance by Turner, who hasn't been this good in eons."
3,kathleen turner at her best,"Crazy comedy in black humour narrating the adventures of Beverly Sutphin, a charming mommy at first, with two student son and daughter and a husband with a job as a dentist. But behind this normal and harmless appearance she conceals a dangerous psycho who does not doubt turning up to murder to solve the tiniest vexation which can raise in everyday life.John Waters directs this sour comedy which puts in evidence the American way of life of a typical middle class family. An excellent casting led by a mature Kathleen Turner. In short a remarkable movie"
5,awesome!,this is one of the funniest movies ever. in fact i am going to watch it again right now.John Waters is a genius!
4,"Hilarious, but you have to have the right sense of humor","Very funny, Kathleen Turner should have gotten an Oscar for her role in this wonderul funny film. A loving, Leave it to Beaver mother makes brutal killings. She kills anyone who offends her family. A wonderful film, but you have to have the right sense of humor to enjoy. If you don't you won't like it. You have to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE dark comedies to like this one. It's great, wonderful, and hilarious. See it...if you like dark comedies. But beware it may you may be insulted by it."
4,Pretty cool,Serial mom is a cute movie. The actors you will know and the plot is a good one. This is more of a comedy although there is a lot of killing in it. It's a good movie worth a waatch.
4,Don't we all have Beverly moments?,"Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) wants to live in her perfect world. A world where people dress nice, have good manners and don't upset her children. When people upset her order she decides to take matters into her own hands and starts killing them.This film is John Waters' masterpeice. A wonderful performance from Kathleen Turner and lots of dark, screwball humour add to make this a must have! Be warned though that this film like his others is an accquired taste.The bonus features are great including a Director's Commentary by John Waters.Bravo!"
1,NO good @ all!!!,"Please Mr. Waters don't ever make a movie to appeal to the so called main stream folk! I thought this was a bust from the word go! Kathleen Turner is a bad actress and does not have to try and work at being bad. Edith Massey and Divine must be turning in their graves. I can only pray that Mr. Waters next film ""PECKER"" is back to his older films. Crybaby was good but Flamingos,Desperate Living are the best of the Waters films!!!!We love you Mr. Waters. But this movie SUCKED!!!"
2,Not as good as these reviews suggest,"Although it held together (sort of), I did not find many of the scenes in this movie funny. I could not understand all the rave reviews - basically, it's largely unfunny. This movie gives a feeling of tension throughout - I wondered while watching it if ""Serial Mom"" Kathleen Turner was actually playing the part of a gay man in a woman's body. Who else would care if someone wore white after Labor Day? Siskell and Ebert gave this one a minimal number of stars, and for good reason. Watch it together with a Margaret Cho video if you want to be totally bored out of your mind with bad humor and edgy neurosis."
5,O my gawd!,"This is the wildest movie I've ever seen! Having missed it in the theaters, I saw it for the first time this week. I couldn't stop laughing. Waters is so twisted, and Kathleen Turner is like a stepford wife from hell. If we are really honest, we can see traces of the serial mom in ourselves. How many parents relate to Beverly running over the teacher or wacking the boy who treated her daughter like poo? I loved every minute; Barry Manilow, Chicks with Dicks, murder with meat...all of it. The cast is great, not a slow moment in this dark comedy!"
5,Absolutely Perfect,"I love this film. I love everything about this film. I think that Kathleen Turner was perfectly cast as the good-natured mother with psychotic tendencies. She really makes the movie what it is. The movie is very funny and a unique view of our court systems and serial killers in general. If you are in the mood for a good laugh and are not put off by some scenes of violence, then you will love this movie."
3,James Bond 007: NightFire,"Like the james bond movies, this Bond video games an old game with a different title. While the graphics EA's newest rendition are spectacular, the over all game play is just going through the motion. If you enjoy the first person shoot genre, this game might appeal to you. The driving aspect of this game provides a nice treat in the middle of a shooter game. It is nothing out of this world or special if you are not a fan of the James Bond franchise. It is definitely the best looking Bond Game on the market, but nothing will beat Rare's Goldeneye Bond Game for the N64."
5,Great Game,This is one of my favorite shooting games. It has great levels wiht good graphics and an awesome mutliplayer mode. You can play caputre the flag with a great feature: You can be on a team with your friend and still play up to 6 computer players. The guns in this game are great (especially the sentinel). Get this game!!
3,Not to bad.......,"I just bought this game the other day(i know its really outdated)and it wasnt to bad, but when a couple days later i happen to pick up Halo 2,Bond seemed really weird........Well anyways i think this is an ok shooter,but if you want a great one for your xbox library try out Halo, or Halo 2."
4,Best Bond game ever,"This Bond game has a great plot. It may be a little out there at times, but is very enjoyable. Like ""Agent Under Fire""game it was an original plot, but unlike it, I feel this plot was much more practical (in comparission). The best part was the multi player maps and actual characters from the movies (you can even use odd jobs hat as a wepon which kills in one hit). The addition of the self guided rockets make the multi player map much more challenging if you play with either bots, or real people."
5,The Best is Bond ( Like I had to tell you! ),"Nightfire is the best Bond game to be released since Goldeneye!The plot lacks some 'Pa-ZAZ' I enjoyed the plot and story line of Agent Under Fire, but Nightfire has a much improved multiplayer mode.Bond will keep you playing and playing, over and over again!"
1,"just like the other 007 games, [its bad]","I have already wasted enough money on 007 games. The 007 graphics always [are bad](during gamplay it looks like gamecube graphics :(, but are ok during cut scenes). Their bullets look like flying blocks, and their is no freaking blood, they get hit with a rocket launcher and fall down to their knees instead of flying backwards."
5,The best game there will be that is offline only,"its offline but o well, cant beat a good bond game, hope it lives up to its standard, and how high it has been built up."
2,This better be good,"I plan to buy this when it comes out, just like the other guy said, if it is anything like agent under fire I will never buy another bond game again. They could have atleast made a multiplayer mode."
3,"fun with multiplayer, campaign is ok","i loved this game mostly for multiplayer, playing by yourself on the game is fun to, the campaign is decent, fun game to get"
2,Very Bad Game,This game is extremely bad. The graphics are bad and after you beat it once you don't want to ever beat it again. You are in 2nd person shooter which is bad and your enemys dissapear after they die which is unrealistic. The multiplayer is the only thing that saved this game from getting a 1 star. Even then the multiplayer mode is mediocre. Borrow this from a friend. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
2,"Predictable, Tedious, and outdated","I've been playing games since I can remember, and right away one thing sticks out like a sore thumb when I put this in my xbox:the ai is a joke. Halo raised the bar, and this game does not live up to it. Unfourtunetely, unlike EA's cousin MOH, this game doesn't have an effective atmosphere to make up for that. A lot of things that you should have control over are watched via cinematics.The graphics work, the sound is ok(bond is ruined by the terrible impersonator, a suprise after Buffy), and unlike Goldeneye, there is no consitent hit detection or blood.So I guess you will love this if you are the type who lines up to get DAD when it came out on DVD, otherwise halo,unreal,rtcw,and moh frontline all do better jobs."
4,Best Bond Ever,"This game rocks! You are Bond and you have to fight villains. At times the game can be predictable (i.e., what Kiko does), and it contains some innuendo (i.e., Zoe adjusts her hair after leaving a dark room w/ Bond), but it is great & the multiplayer is sweet. My only complaints are a) not enough levels, b)Goldfinger ... in multiplayer. Other than that, 007 is back on top!"
2,Shame on the 5 star reviewers,"Shame on everyone who gave Nightfire 5 stars. This game has the feel of the playstation one. The gameplay is identical to Medal of Honor (Frontline), which was released some 1 to 2 years ago. There are no fantastic graphics. I bought into all the hype the reviewers were giving. This does NOT contain the quality that Halo, Ghost Recon, or Splinter Cell type games have. I almost feel that they should give Nightfire away free as door prizes at the cinemas. This game will quickly be on the 20 dollar game shelf along with bloowake and Munchs Oddysee. Do yourself a favor and do some research. There are some GREAT games out there. Thank goodness for XBOX!"
4,Best Bond Game Since Goldeneye...,"Let's be clear... Goldeneye was and still is the definitive bond game... All others get measured by that standard... Nightfire is graphically superior by a mile, (as you would expect), It looks simply stunning but in terms of gameplay, you are still left lacking...The game is incredibly short and although the aim by EA is to play it again at the harder levels, the motivation to do so just isn't there as some of the levels really aren't that good...If you want a good looking game with average multiplayer (Unreal is far superior) and nice but not too challenging levels then this is for you... If you are anything more than an occasional gamer, you will finish this game within a week which to me is too short for [money]"
2,Bitter dissappointment,The 2 is for the graphics.Pretty good to be honest but the clumsy controls make this game a pain in the ...!.I want my money back now! As one reviewer put it 'Rent before you buy'.Wise words 'Grasshopper'
3,save ur money kids,"i received this game for christmas and i was very happy when i got to play it for the first time christmas night. The graphics are outstanding which is why i gave it 3 stars mainly. There is a gigantic downfall to this game though. Again like ""Agent Under Fire"" there are very few missions. I beat this game the night i got it. there are different difficulty levels but i personally think its boring to play it on different difficulty levls when you have already seen all the levels. Take Medal of Honor Frontline for example, that game has enough missions to keep you occupied for weeks. Nightfire has enough missions to occupy u for 5 hours. Therefor, i think it would be a very wise choice to save ur money and buy a different game with more than 10 missions"
5,Bst bond game,This game is one of the best James Bond games I have ever played. The single player missions are very fun and the split screen is also fun. If you have no one to play with you on the split screen there are bots and you can make them as good as you want and as many as you want. The graphics are very good for 2002. This game is very old but still very fun and it works on your xbox360. I would recommended this game to any one who likes James Bond games
5,Use It Daily,"I have long, very fine hair, that easily gets oily if I use too much product. This stuff not only de-tangles excellently, the difference in my hair after just a week of using it was pretty defined. It's also light enough that I can use other products without weighing down my hair with extra goop. I used to use Pantene Pro-V Detangling Light Conditioning Spray, and my hair was already so heavy after using it that I couldn't really use mousse or styling products without making my hair feel clumpy and oily when I styled it.This product is very light, smells wonderful, and very reasonably priced. Excellent quality."
3,It's okay,I bought this item at walmart because I was in dire need of a leave in conditioner. It's an okay product. But I would have much rather gotten a leave in that is creamy. This doesn't cut it. I use it just to use it.
3,Its Good For Weekly/Occasional Moisture,"I purchased this based on a hair growth video that I saw on YouTube. The woman who created the video highly-praised this product saying that she would "" never go without it."" Well I must disagree! Its good for when your hair feels a little dry and you just want some added moisture, or for when you have new-growth after your relaxer has worn off, but that's it. I don't think it detangles well at all. I have definitely used better!"
2,Ferminol-10 Tummy Firming 4oz,I had used this product about 4 years ago and got significant results. I needed to bring my tummy back in shape and tried about 10 tubes over the last six months but have not experienced any significant change.
3,Actually works!!!!,"I was very happy with this product. Wasn't as good as I was hoping for, but did see a difference in my tummy skin firmness in about 2 weeks, while using it everyday, twice a day. Lasted me a little under a month."
1,would not recommend,"Have not worked, been exercising, dieting and still no change,,, been using twice a day and a couple weeks now still NOTHIN do not purchase"
1,Wanted to love it,"I don't need to lose weight, but would like to firm up here and there. Absolutely no luck on that with this product. In addition, it is a sticky kind of gel that doesn't feel good to me. I wish it would have been awesome, but that just didn't happen. I do not recommend."
